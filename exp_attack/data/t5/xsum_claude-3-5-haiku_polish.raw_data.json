        "Maj Richard Scott, 40, is accused of driving at speeds of up to 95mph (153km/h) in bad weather before the smash on a B-road in Wiltshire. Gareth Hicks, 24, suffered fatal injuries when the van he was asleep in was hit by Mr Scott's Audi A6. Maj Scott denies a charge of causing death by careless driving. Prosecutor Charles Gabb alleged the defendant, from Green Lane in Shepperton, Surrey, had crossed the carriageway of the 60mph-limit B390 in Shrewton near Amesbury. The weather was \"awful\" and there was strong wind and rain, he told jurors. He said Mr Scott's car was described as \"twitching\" and \"may have been aquaplaning\" before striking the first vehicle; a BMW driven by Craig Reed. Mr Scott's Audi then returned to his side of the road but crossed the carriageway again before colliding head-on with a Ford Transit van in which Mr Hicks was a passenger, the court was told. \"There is no doubt that when the Audi smashed into the panel van he was on completely the wrong side",
        "The ban was backed by local authorities in Urumqi, state media reported. The move is the latest in a campaign against Islamic clothing and symbols in the mainly Muslim region. China's government has blamed Uighur militants for several recent attacks - but activists say the violence has been fuelled by Chinese repression. The Uighurs traditionally practice a moderate form of Islam. Recently, though, the influence of stricter forms of the faith from the Gulf and Pakistan has led to more women covering their faces. According to the BBC's Asia Pacific editor, Charles Scanlon, the Chinese authorities regard wearing an Islamic face veil as an act of defiance at a time of growing violence in the region. In August this year, the northern city of Karamay banned men with long beards from boarding buses. Some experts believe such restrictions could backfire at a time when many Uighurs believe their culture is under attack. James Leibold, an expert on China's ethnic policy at Melbourne's La Trobe University, told Reuters news agency",

Horses are only allowed to receive hay-feed or water before a race, but other substances such as electrolytes are permitted post-race. Employees of Palmer and fellow trainers, Francois Rohaut and and Jean-Claude Rouget, as well as the trainers themselves, were interviewed by stewards following a report by the Equine Welfare and Integrity Officer. Palmer is yet to hear what punishment the BHA will hand down. \"I imagine there will be a routine fine for a rule that's been broken,\" he told BBC Radio Berkshire. \"There's no suggestion that anyone was trying to seek an advantage or cheat. It's simply what the rule says. The rules are the rules and you need to stick to them.\" BHA media spokesman Robin Mounsey said: \"Of the substances, three are electrolytes which are permitted in the stables but they just failed to clear it beforehand, while the other substance is permitted in training but just not on a race day.\" All the horses involved, Signs Of Blessing, Architecture, Galileo Gold, and Almanzor - winner of the Champion Stakes - were routine tested. Meanwhile, Palmer has confirmed Galileo Gold will race on next season and the four-year-old will stay in training. \"Horses like him are incredibly hard to find,\" he added. \"When you find them, you want to try and keep",

But a disciplinary panel ruled contact with the pupil was probably made and her conduct had been \"unacceptable\". On Thursday, the Education Workforce Council imposed the suspension, saying: \"The public interest is in favour of her being able to teach again.\" Mrs Hungerford admitted shouting and slamming a book on the desk of the \"provocative and disruptive\" teenager as he listened to rap music in her classroom - but always denied hitting his head.

DUP leader Arlene Foster said Mrs O'Neill was wrong to attend, but was not surprised. However, Mrs O'Neill has defended her decision to speak at the event. She said:\"There are some who would say we have no right to remember or to honour them, we have absolutely every right. \"Everyone, it doesn't matter who you are, has the right to remember their dead in a respectful and dignified manner.\" The four IRA men were shot dead after attacking Coalisland police station. Soldiers opened fire on them as they dumped a lorry used in the machine-gun attack in February 1992. The Ulster Unionist Party's Mid Ulster candidate, Sandra Overend, has criticised Mrs O'Neill for attending the event. \"It is only to be expected that republicans would wish to remember their dead, but Michelle O'Neill's presence at such an event is hardly sending a signal to the unionist community that she is some kind of new departure for Sinn Fein,\" she said. An Alliance Party spokesperson said: \"While people will naturally want to mark those who died during the Troubles, it is important in doing so, the focus is on healing wounds, reconciliation and not glamorising violence. We need to avoid using the past as a political weapon, instead focusing on healing and reconciliation.\" SDLP",

The Unesco World Heritage Site is made up of some 40,000 large black basalt columns which protrude from the sea. It was the Royal couple's first visit to Northern Ireland's best known tourist attraction. The causeway formed when molten rock was forced up through fissures in the earth to form a lava plateau. The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh then travelled to the nearby village of Bushmills to commemorate local soldier Robert Quigg. He won a Victoria Cross for bravery during the Battle of the Somme. Sgt Quigg was given the highest military award for valour after going out into the line of fire to search for his commanding officer. The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh unveiled a statue of the soldier as well as a commemorative stone. His grandnephew, Leonard Quigg, also gave a short address. From there, the Royal couple moved on to a reception at Portrush Golf Club as guests of the mayor for the Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council. Afterwards, they took a journey back in time as they travelled on a steam train from Coleraine, County Londonderry, to the village of Bellarena. Large crowds gathered in Coleraine to greet the couple as they boarded the five-carriage train, built in 1932. The Royal guests were accompanied by local schoolchildren as they travelled to Bellarena, where the Queen officially opened the village's new train station. The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh first made the same journey along the historic Coleraine to Londonderry railway line in 1953 - the year of her coronation. The original station had opened a century earlier in 1853. Earlier this year, two new railway platforms opened in Bellarena, as part of a \u00c2\u00a346m upgrade to the Coleraine to Londonderry railway line. On her arrival in the village, the Queen unveiled a plaque marking",
        "The Institute of Public Policy Research (IPPR) said London's poorest children outperformed those in the north. The report is being launched by the centre-left think tank in Sheffield. The government said extra funds were being given to early years providers to help children from poorer backgrounds and close the attainment gap. The report has also detailed a number of \"tests\" or benchmarks for the government's northern powerhouse scheme. Research by the IPPR showed only 47% of children born in the poorest families in the north of England achieved a good level of early years development compared with 59% in London. Its survey also found five northern city-regions combined had almost as many well-qualified individuals (3.6 million) as London (3.7 million) - but the IPPR forecasts demand for skilled workers in the North is set to increase. The IPPR has proposed 11 benchmarks for Chancellor George Osborne's flagship policy to boost regional economies, including closing the \"stark\" gap in the development of children aged under five. IPPR's director Ed Cox said: \"We will never become a powerhouse economy when our children and young people have such a poor start in life. \"It will take a generation of investment",

Rossouw, in his first season in county cricket, refused to say if his hand had been forced by Cricket South Africa. \"Maybe, maybe not,\" he told BBC Sport. \"I think that story is one I'm going to tell at a different time.\" Kolpak contracts allow sportsmen from countries with associate trade agreements with the European Union to be afforded the same right to free movement as EU citizens. They are not classed as overseas players under the terms of their contracts, but they become ineligible to represent their country at international level. Abbott and Rossouw's decisions came before Britain's exit from the European Union and they are among several South Africans to make the switch ahead of the new domestic season. Among the others, all-rounder Simon Harmer has joined Essex,Stiaan van Zyl and David Wiese have moved to Sussex and fast bowler Hardus Viljoen will line up for Derbyshire. \"Right now, I'm just going to enjoy life here in England,\" Rossouw said, as he prepares to start a three-year contract with Hampshire. \"I'm enthusiastic about the season. I'm 100% clean cut on my decision and I don't think that's going to change any time soon. \"Right now, my home is in England and I want to be here beyond the next three years for Hampshire.\" For Abbott, a four-year deal marks a return to the county he last played for as an overseas signing in 2014. \"I made a lot of friends here during my last spell and it just felt like the right place for me,\" the right-arm pace bowler said. Abbott broke down in tears when he announced his international retirement after helping South Africa to a home series win against Sri Lanka, but said at Hampshire's pre-season media day that he had come to terms with his reasons for doing so long before it was confirmed. \"I've been comfortable for a long time to be honest,\" he added. \"I've always felt like Hampshire was a home for me.

The authority said it was spending about \u00a3100,000 on hosting the event. The organisers of last year's inaugural race said it brought \u00a350m into the region's economy. The three-day event was launched by tourist body Welcome to Yorkshire after the county hosted the Tour de France Grand Depart in 2014. More than 1.2m people lined the 320-mile (515km) route. Mr Parnaby said last year's event had attracted thousands of spectators to the East Riding. \"The council feels that the investment made by the authority, circa \u00a3100,000, to bring part of the race here is money well spent and will provide opportunities for local traders to capitalise on increased spending and help boost the East Riding economy,\" he said.

        "The doctors' union had refused to sit down and talk about improving patient care and had spread \"misinformation\", he told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. Mr Hunt wants to change junior doctors' contracts, which he says are \"unfair\". The BMA said its door was open to talks and blamed the strikes on Mr Hunt's \"shambolic mishandling\" of the matter. The dispute, which began in 2014 and centres around pay and weekend working, has led to strikes being held across England. The next is a 24-hour strike planned for Wednesday, when emergency care will only be provided from 08:00 GMT. Asking by Marr about low morale among junior doctors, Mr Hunt said: \"One of the reasons for that anger is that they were told by the BMA that their pay was going to be cut - it isn't. \"They were told that they were going to be asked to work longer hours - they aren't,\" he added. \"We are actually bringing down the hours that they work.

Savings from the proposal would be invested in making more staff available to crew Fire Rescue Units. But the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) said it would be \"dangerous and reckless\" to get rid of them permanently. The London Fire Brigade (LFB) has released three plans to make the savings. It insists no stations will close and no firefighters will be forced to leave their jobs. The Brigade said it had continued to meet London-wide attendance time targets while the 13 engines had been out of service. It said that bringing them back would improve response times by about four seconds for the first engine to reach the scene. An alternative proposal has been put forward by London Assembly Member Andrew Dismore, who recommends putting the 13 fire engines back into service but making savings by establishing alternate crewing at stations with some specialist appliances. The proposals will be discussed on 2 December and there will be a full public consultation on how the Brigade will find the savings, LFB said. The FBU said it was \"opposed to the removal of any",

It now goes to the Senate. The opposition Democrat Party has warned that the passage of the bill will trigger street protests. It did not take part in the vote, but the bill passed by 310 votes to 0. The bill's passage through the Senate is less certain, reports the BBC South East Asia correspondent Jonathan Head, as half its members are appointed. But this could happen as early as next week and would almost certainly provoke further protests. Advocates of the bill say it will draw a line under the political turmoil that resulted from the military coup in 2006 that removed Mr Thaksin from power, leaving Thailand bitterly divided. This turmoil included the occupation of Bangkok's main airport in 2008 and then two months of street protests in Bangkok in 2010 that left about 90 people - mostly civilian protesters - dead. But critics say the amnesty would allow human rights abuses to go unpunished. \"The proposed amnesty would allow officials and protest leaders who have blood on their hands to go unpunished,\" said Brad Adams, Asia director of Human Rights Watch, on 21 October. \"By whitewashing past abuses, the government denies justice to victims and tells future abusers they have little to fear.\" The opposition believes the bill is aimed at facilitating Mr Thaksin's return, without having to serve a jail sentence.",

Speaking at an event in Berlin, he urged Germany to use its G20 presidency in 2017 to make progress. Mr Carney has previously warned of climate change risks for the finance industry. At the event on Thursday, Mr Carney said that in theory capital should flow from advanced to emerging economies due to high returns. In practice, however, the opposite has happened - and this has driven down bond yields in advanced economies, he said. When money has sporadically flowed to emerging economies it has had a destabilising influence, he said. \"In this context, green finance is a major opportunity. By ensuring that capital flows finance long-term projects in countries where growth is most carbon intensive, financial stability can be promoted,\" he said. Mr Carney said the issuance of green bonds - for example, to help finance water or renewable power projects aimed at reducing carbon emissions - could double in 2016 from last year's $42bn.

The St David's Day Agreement had said the vote would be an \"expectation\", and Labour Welsh ministers oppose a referendum before a funding deal. Labour accused the Tories of trying to hold them \"over a barrel\". The manifesto states the Conservatives would \"introduce a 'funding floor' to protect Welsh relative funding and provide certainty for the Welsh Government to plan for the future, once it has called a referendum on Income Tax powers in the next Parliament\". But a Welsh Conservative spokeswoman told BBC Wales: \"The St David's Day commitment we made to introduce a funding floor for Wales is firm and clear, and work is already underway at the Treasury and the Wales Office to bring this floor forward. \"The funding floor for Wales is not contingent on an income tax referendum. Our UK manifesto makes clear our expectation that the Welsh Assembly will hold a referendum on income tax raising powers early in the next Parliament. \"More detail of our ambitious plan for Wales will be announced in the Conservative Party Welsh Manifesto which will be launched later this week.\" On Friday, Chancellor George Osborne told BBC Wales the funding floor would be between \u00a3113 and \u00a3116 per head for every \u00a3100 spent in England, the range recommended by economist Gerry Holtham. \u200b Labour has said it would also introduce a floor to the Welsh government's funding, but has not committed to",

Hibs were making their debut in the knockout stage. \"It was a great experience for this young Hibs team and they were unlucky in the draw - played probably one of the challengers for the title this year, Bayern Munich, with 26 players in the squad all full-time professionals and all playing for their national squads; Austrians, Swiss, Germans, Dutch,\" Signeul stressed.",
        "It means instead of people owning cars and bikes, one version of the future is we all hire transport to get around. This week we got another example of that in the capital when oBike launched. It is a company backed by considerable venture capital and it's putting hundreds of hire bikes on London's streets. The company aims to have thousands in the capital by the end of the summer, after already operating huge schemes in South East Asia. The big difference compared to the existing cycle hire scheme is the bikes have no docking stations. A locking rear brake means they can be left anywhere. Users access them via an app and you can find them as they have a GPS locator. There is a one-off \u00c2\u00a349 refundable deposit to be paid and then 50p per half-hour. More companies are set to follow. oBike says it is aiming to work in conjunction with the existing scheme",

Their best results came when reaching the quarter-finals in 1996 and 2012, a tournament they co-hosted with Equatorial Guinea. During this year's Nations Cup, which also took place in Equatorial Guinea, the Panthers crashed out early after winning one and losing two of their group games. The 2017 Nations Cup will be the first time Gabon has staged the finals by itself. \"Our main challenge is to organise a better competition than we did in 2012,\" Mba Nze, the secretary general of the Gabonese federation, told BBC Sport. \"I think we won the bid because we made a good presentation and we have made efforts to improve all the stadiums, hospitals and media facilities. \"We are more developed than we were for the last Nations Cup.\" Gabon will use two stadiums",

Predominantly male, the \"superfans\" are also more likely than most consumers to buy music on CD or as downloads. The results came from a survey of 504 UK residents, who had attended at least one festival in the last year. According to ticketing website Eventbrite, which commissioned the survey, these \"superfans\" help to \"drive the music festivals market\", often recommending music and events to their friends.

On average, they spend \u00c2\u00a345 more per event than a casual fan, but their loyalty is not guaranteed: 46% say that festivals are becoming \"too corporate\".

Suffolk Constabulary said it warned Norfolk Police about the group ahead of its arrival on Friday. Norfolk confirmed it was made aware and said it was reviewing its response. Suffolk officers said they told their Norfolk colleagues about the group after it was issued with a local authority notice to leave Lowestoft on Friday afternoon. The notice had been served after a number of incidents of disturbance in the town. Norfolk confirmed it had been told but said there was \"no intelligence to suggest where the group was heading\". On Friday, a woman in her late teens was raped at a bus stop in Cadogan Road, near the seafront. Norfolk Police said there was evidence to suggest it could have been linked to the disorder in the town. One man was arrested and released under investigation in connection with the rape. No other arrests have been made. On Saturday night, a BBC reporter was told by a taxi driver that \"travellers are rampaging",

        "A survey of employees and managers found that a quarter of new fathers took no paternity leave at all. Fewer than one in 10 took more than their two weeks statutory leave. The research by the Institute of Leadership & Management (ILM) blamed \"ingrained\" attitudes among employers, and concerns among new fathers that they could not afford to take leave. Last year the government announced plans to allow parents to share their maternity and paternity leave - changes are scheduled to come in April 2015. But the ILM said its research suggested the changes would have little impact if attitudes of employers were not addressed as well. \"The introduction of shared parental leave is a crucial step towards enabling more women to progress into senior roles,\" said Charles Elvin, ILM chief executive. \"Yet our research revealed cultural barriers are impeding the uptake of both two weeks statutory paternity leave and additional paternity leave.\" He said there remained a \"cultural expectation\" within organisations that women rather than men will be the ones taking extended periods away from the workplace.

A planned residents' protest has also been restricted to a maximum of 50 people at two locations. The Orange Order has said it is appalled by the determination. \"The commission is now simply a mouthpiece for republican propaganda, allowing them to dictate the terms of when, how and where loyal order parades are held,\" it said. \"The invented new criteria of banning music within 'earshot' of a place of worship not in use, is as mischievous as it is absurd, and clearly put in place to further censor Protestant heritage on the supposed shared streets of Northern Ireland's capital city.\" North",

The 24-year-old's death was treated as accidental, but his family believe that injuries on his body showed that he was murdered. An assessment was done of \"all information known\" regarding the death after contact between his family and chief constable Phil Gormley. Police said the review had included tracing and speaking to people who were in Wick the night Mr Mcleod died, but who had not previously come forward. Mr Mcleod's mother, June, told BBC Scotland last month that if the assessment \"turned up nothing new\" she and her family would continue to fight for a fresh investigation. A separate assessment has been ordered by the chief constable into the handling by the police of the Mcleod family's complaints since 1997 of how the death was investigated. Det Ch Supt Gareth Blair, head of major crime at Police Scotland, said the assessment was carried out \"in recognition of the continued impact\" of Mr Mcleod's death on his parents and \"their desire for a conclusive outcome\".

The pair died in their sleep aboard a boat on Windermere in April 2013. Mr Eteson, 42, from Hale in Greater Manchester, denies the charge. The family had gone to the Lake District for the Easter bank holiday weekend to celebrate a friend's birthday. But on the afternoon of 1 April, Mr Eteson removed the generator from the deck and used it to power a 1kW fan heater to heat the sleeping quarter, prosecutor Mr Graham Reeds QC said. The court was told that there had been no warning to the build-up of the toxic gas because the carbon monoxide sensors had previously been disabled. Mr Reeds said the mother and daughter, both from Leyland in Lancashire, were found dead in their sleeping positions aboard the the second-hand Bayliner 285 motor cruiser Arniston, with fatal levels of carbon monoxide in their bodies. Mr Eteson, who had been sleeping in a separate compartment further away from the generator also succumbed to the effects of carbon monoxide poisoning but did awake to find the bodies. The court also heard Mr Eteson, a qualified gas fitter, had made some amendments to the generator and its exhaust, which experts subsequently deemed to be \"dangerous\".

        "NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) said blood group O negative was vital, as it could be used for patients with other blood groups in an emergency. It said O negative blood made up 12% of transfers, although only 7% of people in the UK had that blood type. Meanwhile, B negative blood is needed for ethnic groups. The NHSBT said ethnic minority groups, who were more likely to have B negative blood, were more prone to sickle cell anaemia, where misshapen blood cells could block blood vessels, causing an early death. It also said such groups were more at risk of developing thalassemia, a group of inherited blood disorders that hindered the blood's ability to carry oxygen. Only 2% of Britain's population were B negative, but hospitals had used 6% more of this blood type in the past last four weeks than the same period last year, said the NHSBT. B negative blood was useful as it could be used for both B negative and B positive patients, the organisation said.

It has fewer than 1,000 students and an income of \u00c2\u00a34.7m a year. Protesters have said that the removal of the small institution premium, coupled with a general cutback in Department of Employment and Learning (DEL) funding, would mean the college loses 31% of its budget. However, an extra \u00c2\u00a332m for the DEL, revealed in this week's overall budget improves the situation somewhat. The college says the addition of extra money means it would be asked to manage on a budget reduced by 26.5%. That's a slightly better prediction but the principal, Prof Peter Finn, says that is still far too challenging. He accuses Stephen Farry of a blatantly opportunistic decision to force the college to agree to one of the solutions he proposes for the future streamlining of teacher training in Northern Ireland. None of the four options includes St Mary's keeping its current autonomy. It says it is determined to retain its character and Catholic ethos, however, Prof Finn says he is keen for what he called \"very deep sharing\" between the various teacher training institutions.

Growth in temporary staff demand was also at its highest in nearly a decade. However, recruiters said success was threatened by declining candidate availability as employers struggled to bring in the skills they need. The Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) said whichever party formed a government after the general election on 8 June must safeguard access to workers the country needs from abroad, as well as invest in UK jobseekers. The jobs report found growth in permanent appointments continued for the third month running in April, with the fastest rate of expansion for 21 months. This contrasted with a slowdown recorded across the UK as a whole. There was also a sharp increase in temporary placements - the steepest since August 2014. However, the availability of workers fell further in April, with the sharpest drop in the availability of permanent staff in nine months. Meanwhile, availability of Scottish temporary candidates declined at the quickest pace in nearly two years.

Science Minister Lee Ju-ho said the satellite, which will collect climate data, was in its correct orbit. The launch comes weeks after North Korea used its own three-stage rocket to place a satellite into orbit, sparking international criticism. South Korea's 140-tonne rocket, known as Naro, was built in partnership with Russia, which had agreed to work with Seoul for three launch attempts. Analysis: What is driving North Korea's nuclear test plan? Previous launches in 2009 and 2010 failed, and this attempt had been postponed twice for technical reasons. But officials said Wednesday's launch from the site 480km (298 miles) south of Seoul had gone as planned and that the rocket had reached its target altitude and deployed its satellite. \"After analysing various data, the Naro rocket successfully put the science satellite into designated orbit,\" Mr Lee told reporters. He said the satellite had detached 540 seconds after launch. \"We now have leapt up a step to become a space-power nation,\" he said, adding that South Korea would use this \"overwhelming",

Allam said that an appeal was being lodged against the name change rejection with the Court of Arbitration for Sport. \"We stated earlier this year that the club would be for sale should our attempt to globally promote Hull Tigers as a brand name and as a playing name be blocked,\" he said. \"As a consequence of the FA decision on 9 April, I announced on 10 April, within 22 hours, that Hull City is for sale.\" Allam, who took charge of the club in December 2010, was asked what he would do if a buyer could not be found and the legal appeal was dismissed. \"I will give it away. Out means I'm out. Have I ever said anything and gone back on it?\" he said. Allam said he and son Ehab, who is the club's acting chief executive, would remain committed to the club for the time being. \"If the appeal comes first, ok, no harm done. If the sale comes first - sold,\" he said. He was sketchy on whether there had been interest from potential buyers and indicated he may stay on should the appeal be successful.

Revenues for the whole sector rose 1.6% to \u00a33.01bn, the first time the \u00a33bn mark has been breached since 2008-2009. However, the report predicted growth would slow during 2017.

Increased revenue from engine and equipment manufacturing, as well as a jump in sales of hire and charter boats, are believed to have driven the sales increase.

Ahead of UN talks in Geneva on the crisis, it highlighted figures showing only 1.4% had been helped so far. Oxfam said UK plans to resettle 20,000 Syrians by 2020 were \"not good enough\", but Britain says it is also focused on providing aid to people in the region. The UK's pledge of \u00c2\u00a32.3bn to help people affected by the humanitarian crisis caused by the civil war in Syria makes it the second largest bilateral donor in the world after the US. Oxfam says while Britain has been generous in providing financial aid for those displaced by Syria's civil war, it \"can and should do more\". It argues that countries with strong economies and developed infrastructures need to shoulder a greater responsibility towards refugees than nations such as Lebanon and Jordan, where thousands of Syrians are now based.

Mr Corbyn has been highly critical of the government's response to the Calais migrant crisis and says the UK must do more. He told me: \"These are human beings, these are people in desperate situations - they need our help and they need our support. \"There's a very large number of people going over to Calais to take aid and support to them - we should be part of the European programme both for Syrian refugees and other refugees.\" His views on immigration are completely at odds with those of the UK Independence Party - whose leader Nigel Farage addressed his annual conference in Doncaster on the issue today.

Burmese bar workers Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Tun were found guilty of the killings in December 2015. An appeal court in Thailand upheld the death sentences handed down to them. Lawyers for the two men now have 30 days to appeal to the Supreme Court - Thailand's final court of appeal. The pair's mothers lodged appeals at Koh Samui court last May over concerns about the judgements, in particular the DNA evidence used in the investigation. \"We don't believe the court can say beyond reasonable doubt that Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo were responsible for the events which took place in September 2014,\" said Andy Hall, one of the families' legal advisors.

Libya saw the most severe deterioration over the course of 2014, according to the Australia-based IEP says. The Middle East and North Africa now ranks as the world's most violent region, overtaking South Asia which received that ranking for 2013.

Netherlands Under-21 international Weghorst began his career with FC Emmen before joining Heracles in 2014. Heracles chairman Jam Smit believed a fee had been agreed with Cardiff for Weghorst, who has also been linked with Celtic. \"I think all the forcing and all the speculation surrounding the player appears to be have come from the Netherlands,\" added Slade. \"There was an initial inquiry some time ago. That's all I can say.\" Slade would like to make up to three signings during the window to aid Bluebirds' push for a Championship play-off place, with the club currently four points off the top six. One is likely to be a striker after the departure of last season's top scorer Kenwyne Jones to Al Jazira in the United Arab Emirates. The Trinidad and Tobago international claimed on social media that the club had offered him no fresh deal to stay, but Slade believes that was not the case, \"I'm pretty sure there was a dialogue going on between Kenwyne's people, Kenwyne himself and [chief executive] Ken Choo and the board of directors,\" Slade added.

It is hoped the scheme could result in fewer visits to GPs -potentially saving the NHS millions of pounds a year. But pharmacies say cuts in funding to the sector could jeopardise the scheme. The Sore Throat Test and Treat service, which has been trialled in 35 Boots pharmacies, will determine if an illness is caused by a virus - meaning drugs will not help - or a bacterial infection. Results from a throat swab, which measures sugars on the tongue, are provided in five minutes. Patients who can be helped by antibiotics will be prescribed them by the pharmacist and not have to see a GP.

The volcano, located 49 km (30 miles) from the Sendai nuclear plant, is also close to Kagoshima, a city of 600,000. Sakurajima's last deadly eruption was in 1914, when 58 people died. The Japanese archipelago, which sits on the Pacific \"Ring of fire\", has more than 100 volcanoes. Sakurajima regularly spews ash and there are many small explosions there each year, with the latest eruption being in February. It is closely monitored by Japanese authorities and one of two volcanoes at Level 3 out of 5 levels in Japan's volcanic warning system, which means that people are warned not to to approach the volcano. \"The 1914 eruption measured about 1.5km cubed in volume,\" said the study's lead author Dr James Hickey, who has now joined the University of Exeter's Camborne School of Mines. \"From our data we think it would take around 130 years for the volcano to store the same amount of magma for another eruption of a similar size- meaning we are around 25 years away.\" A"

Gareth Hicks, 24, suffered fatal injuries during a harrowing incident when the van on which he was sleeping was violently struck by Major Scott's vehicle. Prosecutor Charles Gabb alleged that the defendant crossed the 60mph-limit road of the B390 near Shrewton during awful weather marked by strong winds and torrential rain. Witnesses described Scott's car as \"twitching\" and possibly aquaplaning before it initially collided with a BMW driven by Craig Reed. The Audi then reportedly veered back to its original lane before catastrophically crossing the road and crashing into a Ford Transit van carrying Mr. Hicks who was traveling to a construction site in Salisbury with colleague Patrick Gilleece. Major Scott, who sustained substantial injuries and claims no memory of the crash, contests the charge of causing death by careless driving, suggesting that Mr. Reed was responsible for causing the collision.

        "The ban was supported by local authorities in Urumqi, state media reported. This move is the latest effort in a campaign of embracing Islamic clothing and symbols in the predominantly Muslim region. The Chinese government blames recent attacks on uighur militants, while activists argue that the Chinese repression has fueled the violence. Uighurs who have traditionally practiced a moderate form of Islam have recently received a growing influence from stricter interpretations prevalent in the Gulf and Pakistan, resulting in increased skin-covering among women. The Chinese authorities view Islamic face veils as an act of defiance amid regional tensions. In August, Karamay banned men with long beards from buses, illustrating wider restrictions. Experts warn such measures could result in Islamic dress being a symbolic symbol of resistance and ethnic identity. The law in Urumqi awaits regional approval, part of a larger crackdown where authorities have arrested numerous individuals and attributing violence to militants potentially connected to overseas terror groups. Uighur activists contend that China's aggressive tactics in Xinjiang, including cultural and religious suppression, are escalating existing tensions.",

Horses are only allowed to receive hay-feed or water before a race, but other substances like electrolytes are permitted post-race. Employees of Palmer and its fellow trainers, Francois Rohaut and Jean-Claude Rouget, as well as the trainers themselves were interviewed by stewards following a report by the Equine Welfare and Integrity Officer. Palmer still has not heard what punishment the BHA will hand down. \"I imagine there will be a routine fine for a rule that has been broken,\" he told BBC Radio Berkshire. \"There is no suggestion that anyone had been trying to seek a prize or cheat. It is simply what the rule says. The rules are the rules and you must adhere to them.\" BHA media spokesman Robin Mounsey said: \"Of the substances, three are electrolytes that are permitted in the stables but they have just not cleared it before, while the other substance is permitted in training but only in a race day.\" All horses involved in the race including Signs Of Blessing, Architecture, Galileo Gold and Almanzor - Champion Stakes - were routinely tested. Meanwhile, Palmer confirmed that Galileo will race the next season and the four-year-old will continue to train. He added that horses like him are incredibly hard to find.

The causeway formed when molten rock was forced through terrestrial fissures creating a lavastraphryon. The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh then visited the nearby village of Bushmills to commemorate local soldier Robert Quigg. He was awarded the Victoria Cross for exceptional bravery during the Battle of Somme, having ventured into the line of fire to find his commanding officer. The royal couple unveiled a statue and commemorative stone, with his grandnephew, Leonard Quigg, delivering a brief address. They attended a reception at the Portrush Golf Club, hosted by the mayor of Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council. Afterwards, they embarked on a nostalgic journey aboard a steam train from Coleraine, County Londonderry, to Bellarena. In Coleraine, substantial crowds gathered to welcome the couple as they boarded the five-car train built in 1932. They travelled to Bellarena, where the Queen inaugurated the new railway station of the village along with local schoolchildren. The Royal guests first traversed this historic railway line in 1953, the year of her coronation, when the original station had been operational for a century.

Despite this challenge, the survey found that northern city regions have nearly as many well-qualified individuals as London with 3.6 million compared with 3.7 million for London. The IPPR proposed 11 benchmarks for the Northern Powerhouse initiative, focusing on the need to close the developmental gap for children under five.

He expressed his intention to demonstrate to the world Welsh exceptional hospitality, infrastructure and facilities, believing that the summit had achieved this goal successfully. He stressed the importance of creating a lasting economic impact for Wales, leveraging global exposure to attract inward investment through the forthcoming UK Investment Summit. Barack Obama praised the warm Welsh welcome, lauding the country's extraordinary beauty, wonderful people and great hospitality. Despite some local business challenges that were due to security measures, First Minister Carwyn Jones celebrated the week's success and commitment to maintaining momentum. As part of promotional efforts, world leaders received willow baskets with Welsh presents, accompanied by a note from Prime Minister David Cameron encouraging further exploration of Wales\u2019 offerings.",
        "In a strategic leap forward, Google Assistant transcended its Pixel origins and promised to revolutionize smartphone interactions across Android devices. The intelligent virtual companion, reminiscent of Apple\u2019s Siri, is poised to transform how people engage with technology by offering intuitive app navigation and instant knowledge retrieval. LG's G6 emerged as an early adopter, signaling a significant shift in the digital assistant landscape. As the update falls this week through Android 6.0 Marshmallow and 7.0 Nougat devices, Gummi Hafsteinsson of Google envisions hundreds of millions discovering the assistant's capabilities. The competitive arena exploded with innovation when Lenovo Moto and Huawei announced their partnerships with Amazon Alexa, further aggravated the virtual assistant race. Google's Assistant distinguishes itself through its conversational intelligence designed to engage users in dynamic, contextual interactions. Analyst Ian Fogg emphasizes the strategic brilliance: as more users interact with the assistant, its machine learning algorithms continually refine their cognitive capabilities. Initial launch for English-speaking users in the United States, with subsequent rollouts in Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom, Google's vision of an adaptive, intelligent digital companion begins to take shape.",
        "The election commission (Inec) feared the winner - despite significant challenges - would announce on Monday. The UN commended the poll and acknowledged technical difficulties, demonstrations and Boko Haram-related violence. Voting stretched into a second day in parts of Nigeria due to problems with new electronic card readers, which even prevented President Jonathan from casting his vote. The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) decried the technology as a \"huge national embarrassment,\" while the Inec chair Attahiru Jega emphasized that only a small fraction of the 150,000 card readers nationwide had malfunctioned. The elections, delayed for six weeks by the insurgency of Boko Haram, saw militants attack polling stations in the north-eastern states and prompted a curfew in the Bauchi State after confrontations with security forces. Ban Ki-moon, the UN Secretary General, praised the determination of Nigerian voters and described the process as \"largely peaceful and orderly,\" a sentiment shared by Ecowas which urged national acceptance of the results. However, tensions continued in Rivers State, where thousands protested alleged opposition worker - killings and voting irregularities, with Inec reporting an office burned during the unrest. While results were expected to emerge Sunday night, no clear party lead had been established, marking a potentially pivotal moment when the long-standing PDP faced a serious challenge by the All Progressives Congress, with voters simultaneously electing representatives to the House and Senate.",
        "In the somber embrace of the Southern Uplands, a tragic tale unfolded as Geoffrey Stewart, 74, of Dumfries and his companions \u2014 George Crosbie, 73, and Bobby Thomson, 64 \u2014 ventured into the treacherous hills of Durisdeer. Their familiar terrain transformed into a merciless landscape where relentless rain, swirling snow and howling winds conspired against their journey. Despite the valiant efforts of 16 members of Moffat Mountain Rescue Team and two search dogs who combed through the night the rugged terrain, the harsh elements ultimately claimed two lives. Mr. Stewart and Mr. Crosbie succumbed to the unforgiving wilderness, with Thomson surviving to witness their last expedition. A poignant statement from Stewart's family honored rescuers and mourners, recognising the profound loss and expressing gratitude for heroic rescue efforts. These experienced walkers, longtime explorers of the Lowther Hills, faced their fate in the very landscape they had long traversed, a brutal reminder of nature's unpredictable and unforgiving spirit.",

According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), the vacancy rate was steady at 5.1%. With 31.58 million individuals in employment, the employment surged to a historic peak of 74.2%, representing a modest 44,000 increase. However, job vacancies experienced a notable contraction, dropping 18,000 to 745,000\u2014the first such drop in nearly a year.\n\nThe earnings front revealed nuanced shifts, with average wages increasing 2% year-on-year, including bonus, essentially from 1.9% to 1.9%. Earnings, excluding bonuses, grew 2,1%, signaling a subtle moderation. The number of jobless claimants was decreased to 737,800 in April, though the updated data highlighted a significant increase between February and March.\n\nOfficials of government celebrated the milestone, with Secretary of State Stephen Crabb proclaiming record employment numbers. The economists however, offered a more optimistic perspective, indicating potential signs of economic deceleration and suggesting that the job recovery is losing momentum. Martin Beck from the EY Item Club advised against expecting the rapid unemployment drop witnessed in 2015 to continue indefinitely.",
        "Taibu, a 32-year-old former Zimbabwe international who played 28 Test matches and 150 one-day internationals before retiring in 2012, has signed with Hightown St Mary\u2019s. Initially, Hightown Publicity Officer Nick Gordon suspected a hoax but verified Taibu's credentials through references from Zimbabwe Cricket circles. The wicketkeeper-batsman is set to make his debut against Alder on 24 April, after he approached the club after they advertised for an overseas player.\n\nGordon emphasized the extraordinary nature of the signing, noting that a retired test cricketer joining a Second Division side is unprecedented. Despite Taibu's extended absence from competitive cricket, the club believes his international experience will significantly elevate their summer performances. The signing has generated considerable excitement and disbelief among Hightown's players and rival teams.\n\nIt is not every day that club-level players compete against an international Test captain,\u201d Gordon commented. The prospect of amateur cricketers meeting a seasoned professional has created a buzz, with social media already abuzz with speculation about how Hightown secured such a remarkable recruit. This unexpected transfer promises to inject fresh excitement into local cricket by bridging the gap between professional and amateur levels.",
        "The #penuriecarburantdansunfilm hashtag, which literally translated to \"fuel shortage in a film\" became France's top tweet trend on Tuesday with over 5,000 tweets. A strike over new labour laws affects all eight of France's oil refineries with estimated 20 % of the stations dry or low in supplies. French social media users creatively reimagined film titles to reflect the shortage, renaming classics like Pulp Fiction to \"Pump Friction\" and Mad Max: Fury Road to \"Mad Max: Bicycle Lane\" The Fast and Furious franchise of Vin Diesel inspired variations such as \"Last and Furious\" and \"Pas Fast Mais Furious\", while other films like 8 Mile became \"0 Mile\" and \"8 Miles A Pied\" Kubrick's works were not spared, with Full Metal Jacket changed to \"Fuel Metal Jacket\" and references to Renault's Espace Minivan. User also incorporated Jerrycans with more jokey titles like \"Tom and Jerrycan\" and \"Catch Me If You Jerrycan\" with Drive becoming \"Walk and Drive Pas\".

        "Among them was a vulnerable 17-year-old intercepted at the airport of Sydney, a chilling testament to the seductive power of extremist ideologies, according to Immigration Minister Peter Dutton. Mr. Dutton warned of the haunting and ever-increasing threat of young Australians being lured into the dark embrace of groups like Islamic State (IS). Special anti-terror teams, now vigilantly stationed at Australia's eight international airports since August, represent a desperate shield against this insidious recruitment. The intercepted teenager, on the precipice of being drawn into the savage conflict in the Middle East, was returned to the trembling custody of his parents as investigations delved into his troubled path. Just days earlier two Sydney brothers \u2014 mere teenagers themselves \u2014 were stopped at the same airport with their youthful dreams hijacked by radical propaganda. Despite the school's prudent reinstatement whispers of unease lingered in the home of concerned parents. Australia's anti-terrorism units have already responded with 85,000 individuals, a staggering number that highlights the threat. With about 90 citizens have already disappeared into the treacherous landscapes of Iraq and Syria and 20 have been tragically lost in the conflict, the nation faces a heartbreaking reality. The story of Jake Bilardi, a teenage Melbourne boy allegedly transformed into a suicide attacker, epitomizes this devastating journey -- a lonely soul manipulated into becoming what his father described as a \"trophy\" paraded by IS, a chilling symbol of vulnerability exploited. The law is determined: any Australian entering IS holdings without legitimate cause faces a potential decade behind bars, a stark deterrent against radicalization's arousal.",
        "The amnesty applies to offences committed during the political turmoil after Mr. Thaksin's ouster in a coup d'\u00e9tat. The lower house passed the controversial bill in the early hours of Friday, with the bill advanced to the Senate. The opposition democrat party has warned that its passage will likely spark street protests. Despite the abstention of the party, the bill passed unanimously with 310 votes. The passage of the bill through the Senate remains uncertain as half of its members are appointed, although it could potentially occur as soon as next week which would likely produce further demonstrations. Advocates argue the bill will resolve the political divisions caused by the 2006 military coup that removed Mr. Thaksin from power, a period marked by significant unrest, including the occupation of Bangkok's main airport in 2008 and two months of protests in 2010 that resulted in approximately 90 deaths, mostly civilian protesters. Critics however contend that the amnesty would effectively shield human rights abuses from accountability. Director of Asia for Human Rights Watch, Brad Adams, stressed that the proposed legislation would permit officials and protest leaders responsible for violence to escape justice. The opposition believes that the Bill is strategically designed to facilitate Mr. Thaksin's return without imprisonment, since he has remained in self-imposed exile since his 2008 conviction for corruption. Initially restricted to ordinary protesters, the amnesty was unexpectedly expanded to include individuals investigated by post-coup agencies. The bill's potential passing has sparked significant political tension, with the Democrat Party vowing continued opposition through street protests and potential legal challenges, including a petition to the Constitutional Court.",
        "Over the next few years, Forest Enterprise Scotland will plant acorns around Loch Trool and the Cree Valley, aiming to grow up to 600,000 young trees and create a large, vibrant habitat. Forester Gareth Ventress explained that upon discovering a bumper crop of acorns they initiated a comprehensive collection strategy, enlisting staff from across Scotland to collect acorns from native oak forests on the national forest estate. The Cree Valley Community Woodland Trust, Borders Forest Trust and Moffat Community Woodlands collaborated in this extensive collection effort to spread native forests across southern Scotland.\n\nBy combining acorns from Galloway Forest Park they aim to enhance genetic diversity, linking remnant woodlands and creating robust, disease-resistant forests for the future. The collection process involves laying large felt nets across the wooded surface to facilitate easier picking and to prevent soil contamination. After collection, acorns are carefully sorted and stored with seeds germinated over three to four years. During this period many seeds are graded and deemed infertile, with an estimated 600,000 forgeries to be produced.\n\nThese young trees will ultimately establish new oak woodlands and enrich the woodland habitats throughout the Galloway Forest Park, contributing to regional ecological restoration and biodiversity.",
        "Mark Carney highlighted the critical role of green finance in promoting financial stability in a speech at an event in Berlin, notably in emerging markets. He argued that while capital should theoretically flow from developed economies due to higher returns, the contrary happened, driving down yields of bonds in advanced economies. Carney emphasized that sporadic capital flows to emerging economies have been destabilizing and suggested green finance as a strategic solution. He advocated increased issue of green bonds\u2014such as those funding water or renewable power projects\u2014noting their potential to double from $42 billion in 2015, despite currently representing only 1% of global financial institutions. Carney stressed the complex challenge of addressing climate change, warning that it could be too late to act at the time a clear economic incentive emerges. He also warned that an overly rapid transition to a low-carbon economy could potentially damage financial stability. To mitigate these risks, Carney urged companies to disclose the financial risks posed by climate change to their business models and reiterated his earlier warnings about the potential unrecoverability of fossil fuel reserves as governments pursue global warming limits.",
        "Gene Palmer, the second prison worker held in connection with the jail break, is now under surveillance following Joyce Mitchell's earlier arrest for aiding in the escape. The convicted killers Richard Matt and David Sweat used power tools to flee the Clinton Correctional Facility, launching an extensive manhunt. Palmer has been released on bail after facing charges of encouraging prison contraband, tampering with physical evidence and official misconduct. His lawyer Andrew Brockway admitted that Palmer brought meat to the inmates, but claimed that his client was unaware that it contained escape tools. Attorney Andrew Wylie revealed that Mitchell had concealed hacksaw blades and other tools inside the meat which Palmer subsequently delivered to Matt and Sweat in a section of the jail which allowed inmates to prepare their own meals. Law enforcement is currently concentrating their search efforts on a 75-square-mile (194 square kilometers) area in northern New York State where evidence suggests that the fugitives spent time in a hunting cabin near the prison. Given the abundance of weapons in the region, the authorities believe the escapees could be armed and consider them extremely dangerous and cunning.",
        "In the party\u2019s election manifesto, the party proposed a funding floor only after a referendum. The St. David's Day Agreement had described the vote as an \"expectation\", with Labour Welsh ministers opposing a referendum before a funding agreement. Labour criticised the Conservatives for trying to leverage their position. The manifesto stated explicitly that Conservatives would \"introduce a 'funding floor' to protect Welsh relative funding and provide certainty to the Welsh government to plan for the future, contingent on the coming of a referendum on Income Tax powers in the next parliament.\n\nA Welsh conservative spokeswoman clarified to BBC Wales that their commitment to a funding floor is strong with active work underway at the Treasury and Wales Office. She highlighted that the funding floor is not dependent on an income tax referendum, and that their expectation is that the Welsh Assembly should hold a referendum on income tax powers before the next parliament.\n\nChancellor George Osborne indicated that the proposed funding floor would range between \u00a3113 and \u00a3116 per person for every \u00a3100 spent in England, as noted in economist Gerry Holtham's recommendations. Labour has also vowed to introduce a funding floor, but has not specified a precise figure.\n\nFirst Minister Carwyn Jones criticized the conservative approach, stating that the vote for the Tories could cost Wales up to \u00a3300 million annually. He argued that a fair funding settlement should be unconditional. The Liberal Democrats proposed an independent review of funding arrangements, while Plaid Cymru advocated for an additional \u00a31.2bn annual allocation.

With pride, Anna Signeul's voice rang to celebrate Scottish football's rise -- two teams on the Champions League stage \u2014 a testament to years of dedicated craft and collective aspiration. The journey revealed stark contrasts: Bayern's professional squad, replete with Olympic talent and national squad players, stood as a beacon of excellence against which Scottish teams could measure their potential. Although the results were unforgiving, Signeul saw opportunity in adversity - a chance for young players to view the summit of their ambitions, to understand the rare air of elite competition. Her perspective transcended the immediate results and instead focused on growth, learning and the incremental path to international recognition.

Users use bikes through a mobile app, paying a \u00a349 refundable deposit and 50p per half-hour. While oBike aims to complement existing cycle hire schemes and reduce urban emissions, the launch has sparked controversy among the local councils. Hackney and Hammersmith Fulham Councils expressed concerns about bikes blocking pavements and roads and criticizing the lack of prior consultation. Will Norman, London's walking and cycling commissioner, emphasized the need for dockless bike operators to collaborate with the Transport for London and the borough councils to ensure the schemes benefit all Londoners without affecting street users and pedestrians.

        "In a shocking weekend, Cromer was impacted by 37 reported crimes, including a traumatic rape of a teenager, with residents linking these incidents directly to a group of travellers. Suffolk Constabulary had proactively warned Norfolk police about the group's arrival on Friday, with Norfolk acknowledging the notification but claiming that there was \"no intelligence\" about the group's destination. The grave situation escalated when a late teens woman was sexually assaulted at a bus stop near the shoreline, with police suggesting a possible connection to broader town disturbances. One suspect was arrested and released subsequently under investigation. Local businesses and residents painted a harrowing picture of the group's impact, with a taxi driver described the \"travellers of the town\" and The Wellington Pub closing after a rowdy group of 30 descended. Eyewitness accounts from business owners like Lee Sale and Ayrun Nessa detailed intimidating and aggressive behavior that left families and community members feeling vulnerable. In response, Cromer's Better Neighbourhood Team has initiated police procedures to address community concerns.

        "A survey revealed a stark reality : a quarter of new fathers take no paternity leave, with fewer than one in 10 using more than their two statutory weeks. The Institute of Leadership & Management blamed this on deeply rooted employers' attitudes and fathers' financial concerns. While the government plans to allow parents to share their maternity and paternity leave starting April 2015, the ILM warns that these changes may fall flat without working out workplace culture.\n\nILM Chief Executive Charles Elvin highlighted the persistent expectation that women, not men, will step back from work. The report highlighted another barrier: low paternity pay. Just 9% of fathers surveyed receive full pay after two weeks. Frances O\u2019Grady of the TUC echoed this, noting that many dads simply can't afford time off.\n\nCurrently, fathers receive one or two weeks paid leave, with potential additional time if the mother returns to work. The upcoming changes of the government aim to create more flexibility and to drive a cultural shift that allows working dads to be more involved in their children's early months and helps retain talented women in the workforce.",

They do so with the sound of a single drum beat, with all music stops 43 metres from the church to ensure that no music is within earshot. A planned protest has been restricted to maximum 50 people at two locations. The Orange Order expressed strong opposition and says that the Commission has become \"a mouthpiece of republican propaganda\" and is \"censoring Protestant heritage\" by \"invented and absurd\" criteria. Nigel Dodds of the DUP Northern Belfast MP labelled the resolve a \"bureaucratic monstrosity\" that capitulates to republican residents.

The victims died while sleeping on a boat in Windermere in April 2013. Mr. Eteson, 42, of Hale, Greater Manchester, contests the charge. The family had traveled to Lake District during the Easter weekend to commemorate the birthday of a friend. According to prosecutor Mr. Graham Reeds QC, he removed the generator from the deck and used it to power a 1 kW fan heater. The court was informed that no warning was issued concerning toxic gas accumulation as carbon monoxide sensors had previously been disabled. The mother and daughter both from Leyland, Lancashire, were discovered dead in their sleeping positions aboard the second-hand Bayliner 285 motor cruiser Arniston with fatal levels of carbon monoxide. Mr. Eteson, who had been sleeping in a separate compartment, also experienced carbon monoxide poisoning but regained consciousness and discovered the bodies. Expert testimony revealed that Mr. Eteson, a qualified gas fitter, had made modifications to the generator and his exhaust system which were subsequently deemed to be dangerous.

        "NHS Blood and Transplantation (NHSBT) emphasised the critical importance of O-negative blood which can be used by patients across blood groups during emergencies. While negative O blood constitutes 12% of transfusions, merely 7% of the population in the UK possesses this blood type. C negative blood is particularly important for ethnic minorities, who are more likely to have this blood type and are at a higher risk of ailments such as sickle cell anaemia and thalassemia, which can significantly impact health outcomes. Although only 2% of the population in Britain is B negative, hospitals have experienced a 6% rise in the use over the previous year. Negative B blood is particularly versatile as it can be administered to both B positive and B negative patients. Donna Batty, the nurse relations manager at NHSBT, has appealed to donors to come forward in the coming days, noting that the stocks of these critical blood groups are less than desired. Currently 4% of the population donate blood to NHSBT and is particularly interested in having first-time donors to expand their donor database.

        "Dr. Stephen Farry, the Minister for Employment and Learning, has decided to remove a \u00a31.1million special premium payment that compensated St Mary's University College for its small scale and specialist status. The College with fewer than 1,000 students and an annual income of \u00a34.7m faces significant financial challenges. Protesters argue that the elimination of the premium combined with cuts in the Department of Employment and Learning (DEL) would reduce the College budget by 31%. An additional \u00a332m in the overall budget somewhat softens the blow; the College now anticipates a 26.5% budget reduction\u2014a prospect still deemed unacceptably harsh by principal, Prof Peter Finn. Finn accuses Farry of making an opportunistic decision designed to force the college into one of four proposed solutions for streamlining teacher training in Northern Ireland, none of which preserve St Mary's current autonomy. While committed to maintaining its Catholic ethos, the college is open to \"deep sharing\" between teachers training institutions, potentially involving cross-campus student exchanges. Prof Finn strongly contests the rationale for the removing of the small scale premia and noting that St Mary, unlike similar English institutions, was not permitted to charge higher tuition fees or increase student numbers. Stranmillis University College faces similar challenges and has been negotiating a merger with Queen's University since 2008, a process that is unresolved and will also be affected by the funding reductions.",

Edwina Hart emphasized the strategic significance of the deal, noting that it would ''for many years safeguard more than 750 skilled Welsh jobs.\" She highlighted that Wales successfully secured this critical investment in a highly competitive global market, with Ford's decision reflecting the outstanding reputation of the local management and workforce. The Bridgend plant, operating since 1980, has consistently won significant investments of over \u00a32.8bn despite fierce international competition. The Ford presence provides approximately 10,000 jobs in South Wales, with 1,860 currently employed at the facility. Technicians from Essex and Germany collaborated on developing a new fuel-efficient engine range with the investment contingent upon workplace adaptations to improve competitiveness. William Graham, the Welsh Conservative shadow economy minister, viewed the announcement as a testament to the economic recovery efforts of the UK government. The new production arrives opportunely and offsets the imminent ending of Jaguar Land Rover engine manufacturing and securing hundreds of potentially vulnerable jobs. While two hundred fixed-contract workers were previously released following the cease of Volvo engines production, concerns over potential reduction in manufacturing capacity persist. The Welsh government's financial contribution reflects the intensely competitive international landscape of the automotive industry, where government support is often essential to attract and retain manufacturing investments.",

Temporary demand increased to its highest point in nearly a decade, painting a picture of economic dynamism. This promising scene was also resigned to a critical challenge : declining candidate availability, leaving recruiters facing a skills shortage that threatened to undermine their momentum.\n\nThe Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) stressed the urgency of addressing this talent gap and called for the future government to protect international workforce access and invest in developing the talents of national jobseekers. The report highlighted the remarkable growth in permanent appointments, completing the third consecutive month of expansion and the fastest growth in 21 months\u2014a performance that clearly outpaced the overall UK trend.\n\nTemporary placements experienced an equally impressive surge since August 2014, reaching levels previously unknown. However, this optimism was tempered by a significant contraction in the worker availability, with permanent staff and temporary candidates declining in months at the most rapid rates.\n\nSector-specific insights revealed robust demand in IT and computing, nursing/medical care and hospitality while the average salary for both permanent and temporary jobs in Scotland climbed impressively. REC chief executive Kevin Green captured the spirit of the moment by describing a resurgent Scottish employment market navigating Brexit uncertainty with remarkable resilience and strategic adaptability.",

The multinational mission, headed by the United Nations Security Council and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) has made significant progress in the dismantling of the country's chemical warfare capabilities.\n\nDespite Damascus missing several previous deadlines, a substantial portion of chemical weapons materials have been removed. Ms. Kaag, head of the joint OPCW-UN mission, emphasized the critical nature of extracting from a single site the remaining stockpile. The UN has expressed concern over reports of deployment of chlorine gas by Syrian forces, though this substance was not included in the original disarmament agreement.\n\nAccording to the OPCW, most of Syria's chemical weapons exist as separate components which become toxic when combined. Ms. Kaag confirmed that the facilities capable of producing and launching chemical weapons have been destroyed. \"The Syria chemical weapons programme is no longer in existence as per current declaration to the OPCW under the Chemical Weapons Convention\", she stated, highlighting the significant achievements of the mission in neutralizing Syria's chemical weapons infrastructure.",

        "On January 30th, 1915, England played in a charity match hosted by former England international and Northampton Saints captain Edgar Mobbs, Scotland. The game aimed at recruiting sportsmen to Mobbs' World War 1 battalion. A commemorative match will take place on 24 January 2015 at Olney Rugby Club and involves players from the East Midlands region against the 1st Battalion of Yorkshire Regiment with the Olney Ladies facing the Army Women's XV.\n\nEdgar Mobbs (1882-1917) was a prominent rugby player and military leader. He was selected for England in 1909 and netting a try on his debut against Australia and seven caps. He advanced from Private to Battalion commander during World War I and fought in Loos, Somme, Arras and Messines. Mentioned twice in Despatches, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order and died heroically at the Battle of Passchendaele during July 31, 1917.\n\nAfter retiring from rugby in 1913, Mobbs was initially refused the commission of an officer due to his age. He joined the private profession and became a prominent recruiter, addressing crowds and inspiring over 200 men to enlist. The 1915 international match reportedly motivated hundreds to join the Sportsman\u2019s Battalion, which formed a significant part of the 7th battalion of the Northamptonshire Regiment. Sixteen players who eventually joined Olney perished during the war.\n\nMembers of Mobbs' family, including his great-nephew Edgar Mobbs, will attend the commemorative event. Ryland Adkins once noted that Mobbs was \"Northamptonshire's finest sportsman and soldier\". Jarlath McElroy, chairman of the Olney Rugby Club, described him as a \"sporting and war hero.\" Proceeds from the event will support the military charity of the Soldiers and Sailors' Families Association.",
        "The new charity will manage the National Heritage Collection, which includes Stonehenge and Dover Castle. Currently, the government contributes to the collection \u00a322m annually. The goal is to become eventually self-sufficient for the charity. Other powers such as listing buildings will remain government funded. The new official body, which also will provide advice on planning, has a working name of the National Heritage Protection Service. The new charity will still be called English Heritage, and the 420 sites in the National Heritage collection - including the London Kenwood House and Charles Darwin's Home in Kent - will remain in public ownership. Government funding for the charity will eventually be gradually depleted from 2015 on to nothing, allowing it to generate income from commercial activities and philanthropic donations. Some of the \u00a380m awarded by the government will help to set up the charity so that it is fully operational by March 2015. The planned changes will be subject to consultation The Government s \u00a380m investment and the creation of the new charity aim to maintain the National Heritage Collection for the future, maintain high standards in conservation work and provide an engaging experience of England's heritage.

Their once-supportive relationship unraveled in a moment of rage triggered by an alleged slight against his children. Kelly's brutal assault left Ms. Beattie in her own home a scene of devastation discovered by her unsuspecting daughter.

        "A collision occurred on April 3 at the train station in Penzance shortly after 15:30 BST involving two trains travelling between Penzance and Exeter. The Rail Accident Investigation Branch report revealed that the signaller misjudged platform capacity, believing there was enough space for both trains. Approximately 35 people sustained injuries during the incident. The collision resulted from a practice known as \"permissive working,\" where multiple trains are permitted on the same platform. The moving train, diverted due to maintenance on alternative platform lifts, approached Plymouth at 21 mph along a tight left-hand curve. The driver unexpectedly spotted the stationary train's rear close to the west end of the platform and applied emergency brakes three seconds before the impact, which occurred at about 15 mph. The sudden collision caused standing passengers to be violently thrown into the train rails and on the floor, exacerbating potential injuries.",
        "According to the election commission, the 71-year-old incumbent won 60.75% of the vote, while his nearest rival Kizza Besigye took 35%. The supporters of Mr. Museveni claimed that his opponents offered no viable alternative but Mr. Besigye denounced the results under house arrest as \"shame\" and urged international rejection. \"We just witnessed what must be the most fraudulent electoral process in Uganda,\" he said. EU observers criticized the poll, noting that the governing party created an \"intimidating atmosphere\" and citing opposition allegations of voter rigging. While acknowledging the Ugandans'\"remarkable determination\" to vote, EU Chief Observer Eduard Kukan emphasized that the political dominance of the National Resistance Movement distorted campaign fairness. The election was punctuated by sporadic violence and electoral fraud claims, with social media and messaging apps blocked. Mr. Besigye, detained for allegedly planning to announce results and violate electoral laws, was preparing his fourth presidential challenge against President Museveni, with whom he once shared a close alliance as guerrilla fighters. Museveni, who seized power in 1986 and is credited with restoring national stability, faces increasing criticism for growing authoritarianism. The next significant challenger, former Prime Minister Amama Mbabazi, was also reportedly placed under house arrest.",

Michelle Donelan acknowledged the nuanced perspectives and criticized the consultation as being inadequate for a development that would \"everyone forever change the town\". The 72,000 sq m regional centre application awaits Wiltshire Council's scrutiny with candidates revealing their perspectives during a BBC Wiltshire election debate. Andy Newman enthusiastically endorsed the project, which cited the potential for 700 permanent skilled jobs and wage increases.

        "A 31-year-old singer alleged that she had been denied service by a black cab driver and subject to discriminatory language. The incident follows her previous public commentary on migrants' conditions in Calais. The Licensed Taxi Drivers Association condemned this potentially abusive behaviour and requested that Transport for London conduct a thorough investigation. The artist shared their experience on social media, declaring that the driver instructed her to find an immigrant to provide transportation, an encounter she described as providing an insight into systemic discrimination. While some social media users questioned the authenticity of her account, she maintained the authenticity of her experience. The general secretary of the association said that such conduct would potentially threaten the professional credentials of a driver.

Lancashire Police released the images to mark the anniversary of her disappearance in 2003 as part of their ongoing murder investigation. Charlene is shown on November 1st at 15:25 GMT near Bank Hey Street with her sister Rebecca walking toward the Coral Island Amusement Park. She went home later that evening, but returned to the centre of Blackpool, which was the last time she was seen. Police reported that the clothes she is wearing on the footage are identical to those she had wore when she went missing. Supt Andy Webster stated that officers are investigating potential links between Charlene's disappearance and child sexual exploitation in Blackpool with plans to identify and possibly prosecute suspects. A previous trial for her murder ended without conviction and the Independent Police Complaints Commission found evidence-gathering errors in the initial investigation.

        "Julia Knight, 56, denying that she tried to murder Irene Robson, 81, in October 2014 at Horton Hospital in Banbury while claiming the administration of insulin. At the Oxford Crown Court, she said that her actions were motivated by a desire to prevent her mother's discharge from the hospital. Ms Knight also refuses to pose intently grievous bodily harm, and emphasizes her concern for the continued care of her mother. She expressed remorse, stating: \"I felt terrible knowing I would make my mother unwell. It was a profoundly misguided action that I would rescind if possible.\" The defendant admitted to providing false statements to the police during initial interrogation in January. The evidence presented revealed that Ms Knight had a forged insulin prescription from a Sainsbury's in Banbury. When asked about her initial refusal of injecting her mother by defense counsel Simon Mayo QC, she responded that she recognized the gravity of her actions and felt ashamed. Prosecutor John Price QC suggested an intention to administer a potentially lethal dose to which Ms Knight maintained she never intended her mother's death. The court was also informed about a previous suicide attempt by insulin injection in 2006. While Ms Robson passed away in September, the jury was told that this fact was immaterial to the current proceedings. The trial is currently on.",

Science Minister Lee Ju-ho has confirmed the satellite's successful deployment into its designated orbit, collecting crucial climate data. This launch came weeks after North Korea's controversial satellite placement, which had drawn international criticism. After previous failures in 2009 and 2010, the 140-tonne Naro rocket from South Korea developed in partnership with Russia represented the third launch attempt of the country. Officials reported that the rocket reached its target altitude and successfully deployed the Science and Technology Satellite-2C 540 seconds after launch. \"We have now leapt a step to become a space-power nation,\" Lee declared, noting the significance of this accomplishment. While previously South Korea relied on international launches, this mission marked its first independent space endeavor. The satellite was to meet up with its ground station the following morning with operators poised to assess the mission's full success. The launch carried additional weight in the context of regional tensions, especially following the recent launch of a rocket from North Korea and subsequent nuclear testing plans which had prompted UN sanctions and international concern.",

The sector's revenues soared to \u00a3605m in superyachts and for the first time since 2008-2009 reached the historic \u00a33bn threshold, a 1.6% surge. Despite the promise of growth, Brexit\u2019s looming uncertainty cast a nuanced shadow over future prospects. The industry\u2019s trajectory traced a remarkable recovery from its nadir in 2011-2012 when revenues dipped to \u00a32.85bn and gradually climbed through strategic reinvention. This revival of machinery and equipment was accompanied by a vibrant jump in the rental and charter boat sales. While exports dropped marginally by 0.7% to \u00a3882m, the pound's post-referendum depreciation paradoxically enhanced overseas purchasing power. Howard Pridding, the CEO of British Marine affirmed the industry's robust spirit and emphasised continued revenue growth and expanding employment.

Ahead of the UN talks in Geneva, the organisation criticized Britain's plan to resettle 20,000 Syrians by 2020, despite Britain's humanitarian aid pledge of \u00a32.3 billion which ranks it the second largest bilateral donor after the US. While acknowledging Britain's financial generosity, Oxfam says that economically advanced nations must assume greater responsibility for refugees, especially from Lebanon and Jordan. The charity's analysis of 28 OECD countries reveals that they promise to accept nearly 130,000 Syrian refugees, but only 67,000 actually arrived. According to Oxfam, the 10% targeted for resettlement represents the most vulnerable population of the United Nations. Only Canada, Germany and Norway have exceeded their fair share of resettlement, with five additional nations sharing more than half of their allocated resources. By contrast, the UK is expected to take 22% of its fair share, the US 7%, and France 4%. Oxfam GB Chief Executive Mark Goldring condemned the international response and stated: \"It is shocking that while many people continue to flee Syria, most countries have failed to provide a safe home for the most vulnerable.\"",

Although bad light prevented play during the evening session, it did not impede Clark's progress. The 26-year-old whose previous highest score was 84 no result struck 17 fours and three sixes. Lancashire's remarkable turnaround was particularly noteworthy, having been reduced within 22 overs to five wickets down. Footitt, who had taken eight wickets in Surrey's season opener against Warwickshire, dismissed Alex Davies,'s stand-in captain Liam Livingstone and Dane Vilas, while the Curran brothers each took a wicket during the early assault. Later, Clark commented on his performance, expressing satisfaction with the team position and acknowledgement of the challenges ahead.",

The chain expanded its retail presence by opening 12 new stores, contributing to a 7.1% total sales growth, though that represents a decrease from the previous year's 11% growth. The Like-for-like sales rose 5%, consistent with the performance of the prior year. The privately-owned Swedish group reported significant market growth in Poland with sales soaring about 20%, establishing it as the most rapidly expanding market of the company. Germany and the United States remain the largest markets. This year Ikea plans to launch stores in India and Serbia, with its global footprint increasing to 340 stores in 28 countries. The company has temporarily suspended expansion in Russia pending the resolution of outstanding legal matters. In the United Kingdom, Ikea maintains 19 stores, with planned additions in Exeter, Sheffield and southeast London. Along with new store openings, the company introduced 19 global \"click and collect\" locations, adapting to changing consumer preferences.

        "On March 30, 1981 a chilling moment of violence erupted outside a Washington hotel and destroyed the early days of Ronald Reagan\u2019s presidency. John Hinckley Jr. unleashed a barrage of gun fire, critically wounding President Reagan who was shot in the lung and leaving Press Secretary James Brady with devastating brain damage that would confine him for life in a wheelchair. The shocking assassination attempt reverberated across the nation, with Reagan miraculously recovering and Brady finally dying in 2014, his death ruling murder. The two additional law enforcement officers were also injured in the traumatic incident. Hinckley, driven by an obsessive infatuation with actress Jodie Foster, was found not guilty by reason of insanity and admitted to psychiatric treatment. After decades of careful monitoring, US district judge Paul Friedman determined that Hinckley, now 61, had had no active mental illness symptoms since 1983 and was no longer a threat to himself or others. The Court's extensive evaluation ultimately led to his conditional release, which allowed him to spend significant time under strict supervision at his mother's Virginia home.",
        "The collapse of Emcol 2008 Ltd, the abattoir in Haverfordwest, sent shockwaves through the local agricultural community and left a financial crater of \u00a3660,000 spread among more than 230 creditors. The industrial landscape was marred by mounting debts and unpaid invoices, with one yakder facing a staggering loss of over \u00a3107,000. Newport dairy farmer John Sollis mourned the devastating impact of the closure, describing it as a catastrophic blow that sprang through the rural economy. Liquidator Gary Stones revealed a precarious financial road, with any hope of unsecured creditor payments hanging by a thread, dependent on collection of a \u00a3470,000 debt from an Irish firm. The extinction of the abattoir forced farmers like Sollis to transport livestock and injured animals further afield, adding costs and eroding already thin profit margins. NFU Cymru President Stephen James lamented the loss, noting the grim new reality that injured cows must be shot on farm premises - a stark testament to the vulnerability of the industry. Director Helen Lewis acknowledged the company's struggles, citing escalating operational costs and significant outstanding debts, while expressing heartfelt sympathy for the farmers whose livelihoods were now dramatically changed.",
        "In the shadowy streets of Bermondsey, a tragic tale of young love, jealousy and a fatal confrontation unfolded when Ben Purdy was brutally killed after challenging his ex-partner of his girlfriend about menacing messages that lingered like a dark cloud after their relationship ended. Andrew Bayne, 37, and his nephew Michael Bagnall, 22, were found guilty of murder and sentenced for the violence at the Old Bailey. The court heard how Purdy and his friends, Callum Malone and Jack Walker, initially confronted Bagnall and triggered a volatile chain of events that would culminate in a deadly pursuit across the neighborhood. In a chilling moment of revenge, Bayne Purdy tracked down in Mossington Gardens and fired a fatal shot in his head, destroying his life and future. Despite Bagnall's new relationship, his lingering resentment had fueled a campaign of threatening messages that ultimately led to this devastating confrontation. As the guilty verdict rang out, Bagnall's explosive incident revealed the raw, uncontrolled emotions that had set this tragic sequence in motion, a stark reminder of the devastating consequences of unchecked rage and jealousy.",
        "Masai Graham won with the gag: \"My Dad suggested I register for a donor card, he's a man after my heart.\" The festival's best jokes were selected by a panel of 10 judges and then voted on by 2,000 people. Previous winners include Tim Vine, Stewart Francis and Zoe Lyon. Graham, from West Bromwich, claimed victory after being shortlisted in 2014 and 2015. Comedian Stuart Mitchell placed second with the joke: 'Why is it old people say 'there's no place like home ', yet when you put them in one...' Judges reviewed an average of 60 comedy performances and evaluated over 3,600 minutes of material before selecting their preferred jokes.

        "Heading the somber procession were survivors and loved ones of the 32 souls that were tragically lost in the devastating terrorist attacks on Belgium's airport and metro station. The Belgian broadcaster described the march as a poignant, hushed tribute to those whose lives were brutally ended. Originally scheduled for a week after the 22 March attacks, the march was delayed due to security concerns. Relatives of the victims, alongside paramedics and airport staff deeply wounded by the tragedy, joined representatives from various religious communities in a powerful display of unity. As they walked a path of grief and resilience, mourners carried delicate flowers, symbols of remembrance and hope. The procession wound through Molenbeek, the neighborhood linked to both the perpetrators of the attacks in Brussels and Paris before reaching the makeshift memorial outside the bourse of the city. Hassan Bousetta, one of the organizers of the march, passionately declared : \"When our defenseless fellow citizens are struck down ruthlessly, every citizen must rise to express their collective outrage and solidarity.\" Despite a modest draw of fewer than anticipated 15,000 participants, the march stood as a testament to human strength in the face of terror. The Islamic state claimed responsibility for these brutal attacks that had also claimed 130 lives in Paris. While the Belgian authorities have made numerous arrests, questions persist over the systemic failures that allowed such catastrophic attacks to occur.",
        "Cairn Energy has received government approval in Senegal to initiate an evaluation plan for its offshore exploration blocks. The company estimates potential oil reserves that exceeded one billion barrels following two significant discoveries in the area last year. The evaluation plan will commence with a comprehensive 3D seismic survey and a multi-well exploration and appraisal program for later this year. Cairn, based in Edinburgh, holds 40% interest in three offshore blocks (Sangomar Deep, Sangomar Offshore, Rufisque Offshore) alongside its partners ConocoPhillips (35%), FAR Ltd (15%) and Petrosen, Senegal National Oil Company (10% in exploration phase). Cairn has initiated international arbitration proceedings against the Indian Government over a tax dispute, challenging a $1.6bn tax bill in 2006-07. The company has been prevented from acquiring its 10% remaining shareholding in Cairn India Limited, with the value of its stake declining from $1bn in December 2013 to $526m by 30 June. This reduced valuation prompted a loss of $177.1 million, resulting in a loss of $230m post-tax. Despite generating no revenue and focusing solely on exploration, Cairn maintains a robust cash balance of $725 million, though its share price experienced a 5% decline.",
        "Tear gas and live ammunition were used to disperse predominantly Shia-Muslim demonstrators protesting government corruption and security deficiencies. Authorities initially imposed a curfew in Baghdad, which has since been rescinded. This is the second instance this month of protesters breaching the Government Precinct. ... The prominent Shia Muslim cleric Moqtada Sadr denounced the use of force and expressed solidarity with the peaceful revolt of demonstrators. Approximately 50 protesters sustained injuries during the confrontation.\n\nThe demonstrators say there has been government - negligence on critical reforms, complicated by ongoing challenges against the Islamic State group and diminishing oil revenues. Several protesters infiltrated the Prime Minister's office and the parliamentary complex within Baghdad's Green Zone, which contains key government institutions and diplomatic missions. Authorities subsequently reported full control restoration and protester withdrawal.\n\nThe Government, led by Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, has committed to solving systemic corruption and sectarian tensions. However, parliamentary gridlock has impeded substantive reform efforts. The governance model of Iraq which is based on political and religious affiliations and distributes governmental positions has been widely criticised for perpetuating inefficiency and corruption. Notably, the country ranks 161th out of 168 on the corruption perception index of Transparency International, underscoring the profound institutional challenges.",

        "Remus Hamza, 40, is alleged to have sexually assaulted a 20-year-old woman near Cardiff University when she walked alone home after a night out. According to the prosecution in Newport Crown Court, the victim was so drunk that she could not have legally consented to sexual activity. The defendant, a Romanian resident of Cardiff, denies the charge of rape. Evidence suggests that the woman separated herself from her friends and was walking home along Greyfriars Road, passing under an underpass in the City Hall and along Museum Avenue around 2:00 GMT when the alleged assault occurred behind a bush. Claire Pickthall, the prosecuting lawyer, told the jury that the victim was too drunk to remember the incident, which meant that her level of intoxication meant she was unable to give the consent. Witness Lee Neill reportedly observed Hamza walking with the victim and became suspicious of them, following them and taking a photo as possible evidence. When Neill snagged Hamza with the camera flash, he fled the scene. After losing Hamza, Neill returned to the victim and contacted police. Initial, the victim was so disoriented that she Neill mistakenly identified as her attacker, which led to his temporary arrest. The following DNA evidence ultimately led the investigators to Hamza. The victim testified that she had consumed multiple alcoholic beverages during the evening and maintained that she would never have engaged consensually in sexual activity with a stranger, asserting her personal integrity.",
        "Helen Bailey, 51, was found dead in a Cess Graves beneath her home in Royston, Hertfordshire in July 2016. She had been missing since April 11. Her fianc\u00e9, Ian Stewart, denies the murder. Edward Farmer initially claimed to have seen Bailey in a car in Broadstairs, Kent, between mid-April and June but later conceded that the sighting could have occurred weeks earlier. Farmer \u2013 before St Albans Crown Court \u2013 reported seeing Bailey alone driving a dark-colored Range Rover or similar 4x4 on Charlotte Street near her holiday home, contradicting defense claims that she had been kidnapped by two violent men. When asked about timing, Farmer acknowledged that the sighting might have been on 15 April, weeks before Stewart reported her missing. He admitted he had no specific reason to recall the encounter before being interviewed in June by a reporter. Stewart, 56, of Baldock Road, Royston, faces charges of drugging and suffocating Bailey, disposing of her body in the garage pit, along with fraud and three counts of perverting the course of justice. The trial is still going on.",
        "The Republican tried to laugh off a comment made by a supporter at a campaign rally in New Hampshire, who stated: \"We have a problem in this country - it calls Muslims\". When the man claimed that President Obama is not American and suggested the existence of training camps to \"kill us\", Mr. Trump did not challenge these assertions. Instead, he responded by saying that \"bad things are happening\" and that he would look into them. Hillary Clinton criticized Trump for the failure to denounce what she called hateful rhetoric and described it as \"disturbing and wrong.\" Debbie Wasserman Schultz, chair of the Democratic National Committee, went even further, declaring that Mr. Trump's  Racism  knows no bounds. Trump's campaign manager Corey Lewandowski downplayed the incident, saying he only heard a question about training camps and suggesting that the larger issue was Obama \"waging a war against Christians\" This incident echoed a similar moment in the 2008 campaign when Republican nominee John McCain intervened when a supporter made inappropriate claims about Obama. President Obama, born in Hawaii to an American mother and a Kenyan father, has always spoken about his Christian faith. Trump remains ahead in Republican surveys despite having no political experience having previously challenged Obama's birthplace in 2011.",
        "Jeremy Corbyn navigates the media landscape and formulates policies which distinctly differ from his predecessors. He is deeply moved by the immigration crisis in Calais and passionately argues that the UK must give compassion and support to those in desperate circumstances. \"These are human beings who need our help,\" he insists, advocating for active participation in European refugee programs. His position on immigration contrasts very starkly with the rhetoric of UKIP, which advocates a vision of a diverse, inclusive Britain. Corbyn views immigration not as a threat but as a transformative force that has enhanced the nation's social fabric, healthcare, education and industrial development. \"We've built an amazing cosmopolitan society through hard work and contributions of those who have made Britain their home,\" he asserts. As he prepares to address the Labour Conference in Brighton, Corbyn has to reconcile with voters, especially in the South East, while pushing progressive policies in housing, infrastructure and social welfare. Despite the uphill battle, he remains optimistic about Labour's potential to rebuild and reconnect with the electorate.",
        "The brutal murders of Hannah Witheridge and David Miller on the tranquil shores of Koh Tao shattered the idyllic facade of Thailand's tropical paradise and cast a dark shadow over tourism on the island. Two Burmese bar workers, Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Tun, were convicted of the heinous crime with their death sentences upheld by an appeal court, leaving their families to hang on to a final hope of justice by a possible Supreme Court appeal. The young victims -- Sarah, a bright 23-year-old university student of Essex from Norfolk, and David, a promising 24-year-old graduate of Civil Engineering from Jersey\u2014were brutally bludgeoned on the beach, with evidence revealing a horrific sexual assault. While prosecutors pointed to DNA evidence linking the accused to the crime, the defendants'legal team vehemently challenged the findings, arguing that the evidence was contaminated by police misconduct and that their confessions were obtained through systematic torture of migrant workers. The case has become a haunting narrative of potential judicial failure where the search for truth is obscured by allegations of systemic abuse and doubtable investigative practices.",
        "The Institute for Economics and Peace ( IEP ) reported that the economic impact of global violence is equivalent to the combined economies of Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom. The annual report highlighted a deepening divide between the most and least peaceful nations, with Iceland ranking as the most peaceful and Syria as the least peaceful. In 2014, Libya experienced the most significant deterioration, while the Middle East and North Africa emerged as the world's most violent region, surpassing South Asia. Conflict-related deaths from 49,000 in 2010 to 180,000 in 2014, with terrorism-related deaths increasing by 61% in 2013, mostly concentrated in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nigeria and Syria. The IEP Chief Executive Steve Killelea emphasized the stark \"inequality with peace\" globally, noting that while Western European countries achieved historically peaceful levels, regions like Iraq, Syria, Nigeria, South Sudan, and the Central African Republic became increasingly volatile. The report revealed that the total costs of conflict amounted to 13,4% of the global GDP, with substantial increases in expenses related to internal conflict, internally displaced people, refugee support, the UN peacekeeping, and the impact of the conflict on GDP. The support for approximately 50 million refugees and internally displaced people \u2014 the largest number since World War II \u2014 cost $128 billion, a 267% increase since 2008 The report also anticipated that a 10% reduction in global violence could potentially inject $1.43 trillion into the world economy, which exceeds Greece's total debt by six times and represents three times the annual income of 1.1 billion of the poorest people in the world.",

        "The walkout erupted in a passionate protest over the shocking dismissal of two dedicated nurses, Kevin Gregson and Peter Hilton, who were unfairly sacked after a brutal encounter with a violent patient. The Prison Officers Association (POA) vehemently argues that nurses used nothing more than \"reasonable force\" in a desperate attempt to protect themselves and their colleagues from a dangerous and unpredictable situation. Despite Mersey Care Trust's clinical defense, the heart of this controversy lies in the raw, unfiltered moment when these nurses faced an unimaginable threat. Steve Gillan's powerful statement cuts the core of public sentiment, asserting that the citizens will be outraged by the treatment of these brave healthcare workers who were just defending themselves against a patient who had violently headbutted a colleague and fired at staff members. The trust's claim of caring for \"complex and vulnerable adults\" rings hollow when exposed to the brutal reality of frontline healthcare workers who risk their safety every day. This is not just a workplace dispute \u2014 it's a fundamental question of personal protection, dignity and the often overlooked dangers faced by those who dedicate their lives to caring for society's most challenging patients.",
        "In the delicate brush strokes of Charles Blackman's oil masterpiece, Women Lovers, two nude figures recline beside a cat, a tableau of intimate serenity. When art broker Mossgreen sought to share this ethereal work on Facebook, the social media giant censored the image abruptly incitement over adult content. Paul Summer, Mossgreen's Chief Executive Officer, decried the decision as a retrograde act of prudence and argued that the beauty of the artwork transcends any crude interpretation. Facebook remained resolute, claiming the image would produce negative user sentiment despite the painting's profound artistic merit. This recalls a recent legal challenge by a French teacher whose account was suspended by Gustave Courbet for sharing a nude. At 88, Blackman stands as the last luminous voice of a golden era in Australian art, his contemporaries such as Boyd, Nolan and Tucker have already faded into memory. Blackman remains a revered icon with his works that fetch almost two million dollars at auction, his canvases, who speak volumes where digital platforms fall silent.",

        "The 23-year-old Heracles forward lingered in transfer obscurity, his potential move to the championship club shrouded in uncertainty. Slade categorically dismissed the rumors, yet acknowledged a fading interest in the player from months past. \"To my knowledge, this is not a pursuit we are considering '', he explained. The Netherlands Under-21 international Weghorst, who emerged from FC Emmen's ranks before joining Heracles in 2014, found himself in the center of wailing speculation. Heracles chairman Jam Smit believed a fee had been tentatively agreed with Cardiff while Celtics interest drew tantalizingly in the background. Slade remarked that the speculation seems to have originated entirely in the Netherlands, and his tone was measured. \"There was some time ago a preliminary inquiry \u2014 that is all I can divulge.\" Slade had ambitions of securing up to three strategic signings during the transfer window, in order to propel the Bluebirds into championship play-off contention - the team presently hovering just six points behind the top six. A striker remained paramount especially after Kenwyne Jones left Al Jazira. Despite Jones' social media claims that he was overlooked, Slade insisted that a meaningful dialogue had transpired between the player's representatives and the club leadership. Slade remained resolute in regard to further transfer rumors involving Revell. We must be judicious to avoid undermining our hoop's structural integrity.

        "According to NHS England, the walk-in service aims to reduce doctor appointments and use of antibiotics. The Sore Throat Test and Treat service, which is being tested in 35 Boots pharmacies, can determine whether an illness is viral or bacterial through a five-minute throat swab test. Patients requiring antibiotics will be prescribed directly by pharmacists, potentially eliminating the need for GP consultations. NHS chief executive Simon Stevens plans to roll out the scheme nationwide over the coming year, with microbiologist Dr. Adam Roberts describing it as an \"innovation step\" that could reduce inappropriate antibiotic use significantly. In the initial trial of 360 individuals, only 36 received prescriptions, representing a substantial reduction in unnecessary medical interventions. While chairperson Claire Ward welcomed the initiative, she cautioned that possible funding cuts may hinder its implementation. The throat test is one of eight medical innovations designed to modernize the NHS and address increasing healthcare demands with Sir Bruce Keogh, the national medical director of NHS England, arguing that innovation is critical for building a sustainable healthcare system.",
        "At its heaviest on Japan's Kyushu Island, the Sakurajima volcano looms as a potentially devastating geological bomb. Located only 49 km away from the Sendai nuclear plant and near Kagoshima, a bustling city of 600,000, this volatile landmark is located within the Pacific's infamous \"Ring of Fire\" Its last deadly eruption in 1914 claimed 58 lives and the volcano continues to simmer with frequent ash emissions and small explosions. Researchers from the University of Bristol and the Sakurajima Volcano Research Centre have discovered alarming insights : the volcano accumulates 14 million cubic meters of magma annually, exceeding its capacity for smaller eruptions. This rapid magma buildup suggests a high probability of a major eruption within the next 30 years. Scientists predict that it would take around 130 years to store enough magma for an event comparable to the 1914 eruption, placing the potential catastrophe merely 25 years away. Sakurajima is currently monitored at Level 3 in the Japanese volcanic warning system, with local authorities developing comprehensive evacuation strategies. Dr. James Hickey emphasizes the critical importance of these findings, stating that early warning could be crucial in saving lives during an imminent volcanic event."
