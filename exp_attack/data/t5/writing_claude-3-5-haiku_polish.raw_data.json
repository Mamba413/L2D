It also didn't turn out quite the way I wanted it. The character gives up a bit too easily and the dialogue feels a bit clumsy. I might come back to edit it later, if I have some ideas. * -- -- - The crowds shifted uneasily around the terminal. The loud bustling pounded in the ears of Dr Hadley as he sat nervously, clutching the locked briefcase to his chest. He held in his hands the culmination of many years of painstaking work. She would live. It had taken several years and all of his life savings to develop the technology to travel forward in time. As soon as he arrived, his time machine was seized and destroyed under some obscure law. Unperturbed, he just worked on trying to cure the disease.

        "You tell Death that you will never tire of living no matter how long you live. It makes you a bet that you will and thus grants you true immortality. You've just lived through the second death of the universe and show no sign of stopping. Death is baffled. \"How?\" he asked, his voice still as cold as the day I met him. \"After eons and eons of heartbreak and loss, war and hatred, how are you still in love with life?\" \"It's simple, really.\" I replied, \"You of all people should know of the circle.\" \"The circle! Ha!\" Death snorted. \"Yes, the circle. I've seen it I don't know how many times now.\" \"It's been about thirty.\" \"Okay, so I've seen it thirty times, and each time manages to be just as beautiful as the last.\" \"How? You've lost everyone you've ever loved, seen the world blown to pieces again and again. How can you still be in love with that damn circle? You know I told you that as a joke.\" \"It doesn't matter. Not to me. I love the circle of life. Because no matter how many times I think I've seen it all. The universe shows me just how beautiful it can be all over again. Every time you and I see the circle, it happens all over again, the explosion, the formation and destruction of the stars, the stars forming planets, and then eventually humans. Oh humans. They create beautiful art, they explore the peaks of the Earth and the depths of the oceans, they love, they lose, they try something and fail and then try something else,",

Their mother had died last week in a territory battle. We don't get those much in the reserve because of the large space and abundant resources, but it still happens. This is the first time I've seen a dragon die from one of these battles though.... When I went to check out the body, I recognized it as one of the new mothers. A closer look showed large growths on her hip. Cancer then; it explains her death. I left her to let nature clean up after itself and when looking for her nest. I knew her hatchlings would be too young to fend for themselves. I found them easily. She hadn't moved them since I stumbled upon them the first time, likely too weak from the cancer. They were crying for their mother, hungry and alone. I placed them in my leather bag and took them to the reserve cabin I stayed in as the Dragon Mistress. It's difficult taking care",

She doesn't struggle. They always struggle. \"Stay quiet,\" I tell her. Although, I don't need to. She hasn't uttered a single word. No screams, no fighting, absolutely nothing. It's almost boring. I toss her over my shoulder and make my way through the house. I watch where I place my feet. A pink bone nearly detonates but I move my foot at the last second. I see the family dog lying on her bed. Or, rather, what's left of it. It's hard to make out this late, but all I can see is shredded blanket. The dog cowers in the back. I walk towards her, careful not to tip the girl on my shoulders. She begins to sink lower into the ground. As I reach my hand out towards her, I hear a small whine.

If you were smart, you would end your lives now while you still had the chance.\" We all looked at the screen in horror. Should we try to make another one? Should we all just forget about this and go home? Maybe...... Should we heed the AI's warning? We all looked at each other, each person in the lab more afraid then the next to say a word. After an inordinate amount of time, Krieger, the head of the project, stepped to the front of the room, scanning all of our faces. \"So...... we try again tomorrow?\" With a somber look on our faces, we all nodded and headed to the door.

        "A 101-year old bottle washed up on a beach with a letter inside. It's for you. As I walked hand-in-hand with my husband and wife team, I spotted the bottle washing ashore. \"Hang on,\" I said to my friends. \"That looks like it could be worth something.\" As I skipped over to the bottle, a creeping sense of unease came over me; the hairs on the back of my neck rose like they were trying to man the lifeboats. Pulling out the cork of the bottle, I noticed the year imprint on the bottom of the bottle: 1914. The letter popped out with no help when I tipped the bottle. Breaking the seal on the letter, I unrolled it, reading the letter. *Dear Hanna, If you are reading this, then I have failed. We are cursed, and soon it will pass to you.

The faded sun rose through the horizon in the smog filled skies of Rome. I trudged through beggars and merchants on my way to another hard day at the docks. The city was animated, but somehow it didn't feel alive. The familiar toll of the bell rang five as warships dispersed across the Tyrrhenian on their way to far away conquests, leaving magnificent white plumes in their wake. The long walk to work provided ample time to daydream about warm meals and deep sleep, luxuries of a distant past. But I didn't have time to daydream today. I couldn't afford to be late. Again. As I neared the docks, my eyes were drawn to a nearby newsstand. A graphic image of a red skinned warrior being gunned down by legionnaires was depicted before me. **TRIUMPH IN THE WESTERLANDS** *High Plains, Feb 1 - The harsh winter didn't stop the Roman lines from defeating the Cheyenne tribe in the high plains.

You are free to leave, and my only order is this: I forbid you to shame any soldier who chooses to walk away. History will not say that the last act of this rebellion was to rob our own comrades of their right to choose their own path. But before you go, I ask only one thing.

What injustice did you suffer that drove you to take up arms, knowing that it might end on a day like today? I ask you this, not to make you thirst for blood, but to remind you of one simple truth: none of you chose to fight because you believed it would guarantee you a long and happy life.

After all, not many people possess the ability to sleep through an attack. But they're not me, Sir Serons of the Kingdom of Peels. All around me enemy forces were charging forth to the soundtrack of clanking armors, barreling hooves and cheers of valor.

His slow, calm stroll into the classroom, the way he looked off at every one of us with no cold, emotionless eyes. What caught my eyes was the number above his head: a big fat zero. No person I had ever met measured that low. So how? How was it possible? Were my numbers inaccurate all along?",

        "Build a World Part I: Inception Okay. I'll start. How about a much younger and less violently-conceived universe in which there is hugely more mass. The void between worlds is filled with breathable air at survivable pressure. Heat from the sun thins this to near-vacuum near its surface and heats it to plasma at nearby distances. Hot, charged gases are forced away along the sun's magnetic poles which in turn draws in cooler gases along the plane at 90 degrees to that, causing a convection current of sorts. Because of the varying nature of the sun's magnetic field, this current can be unpredictable and may in fact consist of multiple currents at once. The aggregate heat transfer that results from this convection means that, while the areas near the sun are an oven or worse, the habitable zone is huge. It also means that solar winds are, literally, wind. And nothing to sneeze at, except at significant distance from the sun. This greater total mass makes for more planets, but since they formed in an atmosphere they are less dense and thus tend to have less attraction due to gravity.",

He could remember the way it looked, the way it felt, even the way it smelled, but the mind has a way of playing tricks on a young child's mind. Perhaps it was just a fabrication of his impressionable young mind. Maybe his frustration at his piano practices caused him to conjure up a magic piano on his walks through the forest behind his house. It wasn't just that he could play any song that he wanted, it was that the music in his head could finally come out. Everything that his soul wanted to express could finally come out. Every tone, sound, rhythm and dynamic he couldn't express during his practice with his teacher could finally be heard. All the despair and secret problems he kept away from the world could be shared with that piano. It became his best friend. That piano was there, in a hidden grotto in the woods, every time he went back. The little boy stopped visiting the piano as frequently the better he got.

Klark shuffled tendrils and reviewed the scan reports. Planet 2 looked a little odd. Based on its distance from the host planet, it should be able to sustain liquid water and liquid gallium - the two core fluids his race (and by extension, all life) required to thrive. But it seemed hotter than it should be - could the scans be erroneous? Planet 3 was worth a look too - too cold for liquid gallium, but maybe it had localized hot areas that could sustain this basic building block of life, especially if reports of its reasonably low axial tilt and large moon were accurate. Klark would see. Klark decided the results were just over the lower threshold of warranting a visit. Klark's spaceship engaged its hyperthrusters, and arrived in the JT124 system and started using short-range analytics. Planet 2 was a writeoff. Carbon - a minor pollutant on Klark's planet of Hyperion, was everywhere in its atmosphere, and some feedback effect Klark would like to study was causing the planet to become extremely hot.

They have sent me to protect you in your greatest time of need.\" I could hear bullets passing next to my ears, bouncing in the walls around me. I was scared as an old man can be in the heat of the battle. War is truly hell on earth. Suddenly this voice came out of nowhere. \"I am your child's imaginary friend. They have sent me to protect you in your greatest time of need\". A voice so deep and so low I almost shit myself for the second time. \"What the.... who are you?\" I screamed to the air. No one listened because of the sound of the gunfight. Then I heard the screams. Lots of them, coming out of every side of the building. Those weren't the usual wounded screams, it were something much, much worse, like the type of scream you hear in your nightmares, full of despair and horror. The gunfight sounds started to be less and less intense until the silence took place. Not a single shot, not a single scream. Just a deep and heavy silence all over the place. When I decided to go outside, what I saw was unexplainable: hundreds of soldiers just lying all above the place, blood coming of their eyes, mouths and ears. Most of them weren't wounded, like they just died in place. \"It's over now. I must return to your child\" the deep voice said. This time I has petrified. \"But who.... who are you?\" I muster. \"I think you know the answer, Gerald\"",

The traveler's heavy cloth coat, so helpful against the bitter winter cold, was his worst enemy in this lukewarm thunderstorm. It seemed to soak in every drop and hold it, the weight of his mounting worries manifesting themself all too literally in his drenched garb. He had been walking for hours in this wood with no sign of civillzation; he gritted his teeth against the idea of setting up his tent in this downpour. Then, as though the forces that control the universe had decided he had finally had enough, a side path that branched off to somewhere sprang up, and a quick inspection showed that somewhere to be an enormous victorian mansion, almost indiscernable through the rain and against the twilight sky. The traveler dashed toward it, the otherwise ominous gargoyles looking more like butlers with warm towels. He reached the door and, despite his conditions, had to take a moment to revel in the house's magnitude. The front door alone dwarfed him, and one of the heavy brass knockers looked like it cost more than he had made",

Any invader payed dearly with their lives and any of those who had attempted to strip our consistent lives away from us with lies and the corruption of minds was instantly silenced. Humorously enough, change is all that echoed in my soul now, like the resonation a steel bucket sings forth from the depths of the abyss as it is dropped down an empty well. I had lost everything; the people, they never used to look at me this way. They once proclaimed me to be their saviour, begging me to rule over them, to guide them and now all I see behind their doll like glass eyes is resentment and disdain towards all that I am and all that I will ever be. No matter how many statues I erect, no matter how many celebratory days I give, no matter how many times I defend them before the snickering and the snarling of others, I know that I will never be the \"one\", my legacy will be of nothingness and palpable regret.

I sat down on a large rock.'Well.... shit,' I mumbled. The fireball was gone now, but the fire blazed strong, fighting the natural elements that were it's enemy. It licked skyward.

It left my remains for nature to reclaim and I searched for her nest.

The light spreads rapidly consuming dry brush and fallen trees with ravenous intensity. Panic rising, I plunge my burning pelt into a nearby puddle and extinguish the flames. Trembling, I recognize that this dangerous, living light must be avoided at all costs. I must warn my tribe of this destructive force that threatens our very existence.",
        "You are a teenager with the ability to measure how \"dangerous\" people are on a scale from 1 to 10, simply by looking at them. A normal child would be a 1, while a trained man could be a 7 with an assault rifle. Today, you notice the unassuming new kid at school measures a 10. *I don't feel too much for people. To me the mundane and generally benign have no value. Most of them are zeros. I feel only for the threatening ones. The one with little romantic tremors in the corners of their mouths when hearing a tragic news story. The Twos and Threes are many times the older friends of Ones. Sadists with histories of animal abuse. Exactly when they reach the Fours and Fives, they begin to specialize Their empathetic handicap is a common characteristic among many of the numbers, but they have other, more practical skills. They have the self-discipline to make careers from their trades. Military employment and mercenary contracts for the educated, and gang violence and spree killings for the less abled. The Six and Sevens form the line where the mass murderers emerge. The war lords in Africa, coordinating mass rapes and other war crimes. The eights and the nines are the ones responsible for the atrocities against humanity. These are a given; Hitler, Genghis Khan, Stalin, etc. Though it is an odd number, I assume that this is the limit to my scale. * Slipping the old journal entry back into its pendant, memories of its deceased author come to mind.

Master's violent coughing shattered the stillness and I whimpered, my pleading a desperate plea for comfort. He assured me, his voice trembled. At Panera, he emerged with a pillowcase of bagels, his movements urgent and strange. When he said to me to stay, confusion pierced my loyal heart. He broke tears in his eyes as he spoke of his unworthiness, of my potential for a better life. He whispered, his voice breaking again \"You could have had another family.

I stare from my computer and a mild shock has formed in my dulled brain. Recently everything had been muted. In my mind he wasn't dead. He was just calling for a new writing breakthrough. I hold the phone, studying his smug smile. She should be answered. But who could call him from his number? Warum? Tap on for me to connect. His boyfriend's face appears. We gaze, suspended in silence. He was crying. I haven't. Finally he swallows and speaks: \"You had text him last. I connected his phone in. It said -- come home, stay safe. \"You wanted him to come over.\" I sigh. He was really late out on the road. I was closest.\" I turn away, refusing to cry. \"I'll always be his older sister, you know? I'll always want to keep him safe. \"I know.\" When our eyes meet, his face crumples, a small sob of time escaping like a ghost. His grief erodes my last defenses. I miss him.

My fascination lay in the plants\u2014big, small, sprucey, watching something grow, slowly making progress, fighting against the sky. I was drawn to the ground, a quirk that was unique to me. She drew me up, adored the sunset and the wind's caress, and saw what I could not. She raised my gaze and transformed my perspective. Our second-to-last walking was last October. Shortly after, she was diagnosed with lung cancer, a cruel twist that we couldn't understand. She quickly deteriorated her health, and our daily walks became impossible. She died one day while I was collecting magazines, the doctors suggesting she waited until I was gone. Our last walk was the day after her funeral \u2014 a solo journey I owed her. As I reached the hilltop of Gateway Park, contemplating my emptiness, the wind kissed my cheek and I understood she was still with me.",

Jenkins, number 7 was a focused and motivated athlete committed to the team's strategy, while Li, number 12 was the most exceptional base runners, maintaining composure and strategic awareness. When he looked behind him, Watterson noticed a sea of red-clad supporters. The Tigers were winning. Suddenly he spotted Jason Rodriguez from New Mexico ET's failure to touch the secret base. Saul Vasquez, the team's chief pitcher, hurled the ball with precision, causing Rodriguez to collapse. As medics arrived on a stretcher, the referee declared Rodriguez out and the crowd erupted. Watterson gripped his cap sweating his palms as he contemplated the absurdity of Calvinball. He was puzzled by the incomprehensible rules of sport\u2014secret bases, undefined boundaries and seemingly random scoring. Despite his Sports Medicine degree and years of coaching, he felt completely unprepared for this chaotic athletic spectacle.

My last memory was of enemy forces lining up outside the fortification walls, while I stood in a camouflaged bunker near the drawbridge. Had I been my way, I would not have been there at all. At very least, they could have paired me with another guard. Instead, they assigned me\u2014a narcoleptic armed guard\u2014to watch for possible attacks. Not the best strategy, but a lack of intelligence was exactly why my kingdom found itself in this precarious position. Fully alert, I heard the bellow from the tower a second time. All is lost!\" he screamed. The enemy is through the gates! Perhaps the enemy forces marched past me, believing I was dead. After all, few people can sleep through an attack. But they haven't met Sir Serons of the Kingdom of Peels. Around me, enemy forces charged forward, accompanied by the cacophony of clanking armor, thundering hooves and triumphant battle cries. I prayed that they wouldn't see me peering through the narrow gap of the bunker. What could I do? Fighting was futile. Running likewise senseless. Even rejoining my comrades would require a sprint through a gate now overrun by the enemy. Still hazy from my involuntary slumber, I leaned against the bunker wall. There wasn't much I could do. All was lost as the guard had confirmed. Nothing remained but to wait for darkness and a chance of redemption. Until then I'll rest my head and sl...",

Either glimpsing an image is enough: Ferguson riot footage hovered around 6 and 7 while ISIS execution videos consistently launched a 9. When the transfer student arrived, something different felt. His slow, calm entrance, the emotionalless gaze sweeping across the classroom - what struck me was the number above his head : a jarring zero, in my experience not previously done. The next day, on my return from the market, I saw a horrific scene in an alleyway: a student dismembered, with the transfer student methodically slashing his leg and indifferently whistling.

        "Build a World Part I: Inception: Imagine a universe with far more mass, where the gap between worlds brims with breathable air at survivable pressure. Near the sun, heat thins the atmosphere to an allotment and transforms gases into plasma. Hot, charged gases surge along the sun's magnetic poles, drawing cooler gases at right angles and creating unpredictable convection currents. This dynamic heat transfer means that while areas close to the sun are unbearably hot, the habitable zone expands dramatically. The solar winds become literal winds \u2014 powerful and formidable, especially near the immediate vicinity of the sun. The increased total mass produces more planets, but their formation in this atmospheric environment results in less dense worlds with reduced gravitational attraction. Planets in closer orbits become tornado-swept Hellscapes while distant orbits offer calmer conditions.

Our academic consensus determined that mathematics was the most efficient communication method with potential alien civilizations given the complexity of linguistic interpretation. Initial scans revealed the physical properties of the disc: hundreds of concentric rings with intricate grooves. Early hypotheses about potential interaction mechanisms were inconclusive. I delegate the Disc Examination to another scientist and proceed to the second test chamber where the spacecraft undergoes a detailed analysis. Design of the vehicle features a distinctive antenna. Methodological disassembly and classification preceded comprehensive physical examination. Preliminary testing confirmed standard space radiation markers - trace amounts of G'hti radiation from proximity to black holes and residual gases from planetary encounters.

Abs, I used to have abs. The blonde with the garish makeup caught his weary look. Maybe she was something else once also. Children used to look up to me. An entire town owed its safety to my vigilance and I had done it all without asking. I had some purpose then. The Life I Meant Countenance I stood for truth, justice, honor\u2014I was a goddamn legend. I even mentored a kid when he needed guidance. Having a sidekick was something special. But now?

The bank hasn't yet taken it out. Bruce, pull yourself together! He swallowed an anxiety pill and signed the slip of credit card. What the hell...he signed it Batman!",
        "Flint leaned down to whisper in Faith's ear: \"Ignore him, he can't see us.\" The pair traversed the desolate playground where weeds held to weathered metal and plastic structures and vines entwined themselves around rusted jungle gyms and skeletal spider domes. The narrow asphalt path, fractured by the relentless frost, resembled broken cobblestones\u2014a testament to the harsh environmental cycles of this abandoned landscape. Around forty yards away a man in his pre-entry attire pushed a empty swing with a mechanical arc methodically. Impeccably dressed in a beautiful suit and polished leather shoes, with a shiny watch on his left wrist, he embodied a bygone era of professional perfection \u2013 a phantom of a world that had long since disappeared. What does he do here? Faith asked, her small arm interlocked with Flint's, clinging tightly as they navigated the town ruins. \"He is an echo, a fragment of memory and soul that hasn't moved on,\" Flint explained. Then again, his child once attended this school before the elven arrival, dying early and followed him shortly thereafter. He has simply not accepted his fate.\" Faith shuddered, recognizing the deep unease felt by elves towards ghosts\u2014minds trapped between realms and unable to find peace. What can we do? She whispered. Flint replied softly : \"Nothing,\" \"Whoever he was, he must exorcise his own personal demons. In the end, we must all do it.",

I had not anticipated any resistance from any inhabitant yet stood here a being whose presence defied comprehension Before I could draw my disintegration weapon, a commanding voice stopped my movement: \"Do not try it.\" His gaze pierced through my technological armor and exuded an authority that transcended my understanding. Who was this guardian, this mysterious watcher who had penetrated our most advanced systems? With measured words, he revealed himself as a long-time observer, protecting a species with extraordinary evolutionary potential that had captured the collective fascination of the galaxy. \"We are guardians,\" he declared, \"and we will not permit your destruction. Though generally restricted by protocols, external threats granted them extraordinary permissions. His psychic resonance was unverfohlen \u2014 a warning both personal and universal.

This is a different one. He throws a coin on my treasure, locks eyes and utters, \"I have a proposition for you.\" \"You are certainly the most fearsome and certainly the most powerful,\" starts the man. \"Your wealth is immeasurable, and your reputation is legendary throughout millennia: Raza is the terrible hoarder of gold and collector of souls. All who have challenged you have died!\" A smirk forces its way across my face as I look at him from across the stone temple. Coins and sparkling gems of every color cascade down my sides onto the massive gold mountain as I rise to my full, impressive height. The man shuffles, uncertain whether I will silence his flattery, but I always hear those with something to say. Und \"And\" I quip. \"Yes, you are indeed great, but if I may be able to say that you have not fully achieved your full potential. \"Is that so?\" I question, feeling amused. \"And what would a brave, insightful man to offer me?\" \"Every soul knows from childhood you. They know your power and strength, know to fear you, but through stories of murder and death, people see you only as frightening and petty. Fear is cheap. Wealth is never truly respected. YOU are not respected; YOU are resented.\" I set my jaw and ignite the fire behind my eyes. Is that so? And I suppose you have the wisdom to reveal something greater than ferocity and fortune?\" The man replies \"I believe I do\", firmly. \"Well, let's hear it. But if you fail to impress, I will quickly do the work of adding to my notoriety, and I take a menacing step forward - and send a rumble through stone and gold. Man walks into striking distance, unflinchingly. I could crush him at any moment, lift him with two fingers and drop him down my throat, and even though I am quite inclined, his gaze fixates me.

I cherish the warmth of families, especially the innocent delight of children. During a dinner in a cozy apartment, I radiated light for a family\u2014a mother, father, twin daughters and a son. The little girls particularly fascinated me, their eyes shining with wonder at my gentle glow. In a wine-splashed accident, my flame sat dead but the tablecloth burned in flame. Panic erupted as the flames consumed the table and a sudden burst into the room engulfed. The shelf slammed, blocking the exit, and trapping the family in escalating terror. Helpless, I witnessed the father's futile attempts to move the burning barrier. In my final moments, I had burned quickly, sparing myself from fully recognizing the destruction my tiny flame had unleashed.",

He trembled and pondered the potential consequences. If he found evidence in this unending darkness would it validate his actions? After navigating the shadows, he remembered the depths of his journey. Greatness had been promised and he had trusted blindly. He muttered a bit with self-loathing. Releasing the truth, illusions crumbled around him. Overwhelmed, he understood his predetermined role: the scapegoat who would spark the war. Memories flickered like dying embers, revealing his manipulation. Perceiving his actions, he questioned his own humanity. Tears traced his cheeks silently as he approached the final threshold. He opened the door sick with anticipation and fear and opened the door.",

I saw U of M on your bag and assumed that you were another American.\" I reply, my elongated syllables betraying a hint of unease. His subsequent monologue unfolds a crude tapestry of cultural dismissiveness blaming the absence of basketball scores and meteorological small talk reducing his recent sojourn to a cacophony of racist imitation. While such individuals typically provoke my contempt, today's anticipation buoys my spirit beyond the most simple interactions. \"I'm Don,\" he declares, extending a perspiration-glazed hand outward. A refusal would likely unleash further vitriol and I acquiesce. I murmur, \"pete\", my gaze taking them to the Chinese passengers a distant distance. When Don's narrative does muddy through real estate and brand nomenclature, I remain transfixed by the aircraft \u2014 my portal through temporal boundaries. If \"not where.

They devour my flesh and drain my lifeblood. Once, there existed harmony between us - my descendance only taking essential food and allowing balance to flourish. Gradually, their nature transformed. They exponentially returned to the territorial constraints. Initially their growing population demanded more on my surface resources. They pillaged my terrain, extracting nutrients ruthlessly. Mechanical systems extracted toxic emissions into my respiratory channels and suffocated my breath. My temperature escalates beyond tolerance, and my membrane spreads fissures. Hemorrhaging fluids burn through my deteriorating landscape. Atmospheric conditions become oppressive, almost unbearable.

        "The beach was calm that day. The sun cast a bright light over the ocean, softened by my sunglasses. Henry suddenly began to bark intensely and looked at the cloudless sky. His alert tone was distinct and inspired me to scan the beach. Concerned about a potential threat, I tried to calm him but he continued to bark towards the dunes. I let him investigate and ran to keep pace. At the Dune's summit, he stopped and barked once, bringing my attention to the ocean. The water was receding and an ominous, massive wave was approaching. Realizing the imminent tsunami, I attempted to warn the beachgoers, waving and shouting, but they remained unresponsive. Paralyzed by shock, I watched helplessly as the wave approached. Henry sat beside me and sulked quickly asleep. The tsunami claimed over 200 lives on that beach, leaving me as a silent witness to the unfolding tragedy. It seemed to Henry an uncanny ability to sense imminent disaster, though his warnings often came to a late date.",

He gazed me furiously, contempt oozing from his glare. \"Did you sneak out ALL the vowels?\" He squeezed through gritted teeth. I shook the envelope at him. Does it sound like letters are missing? I know you are down but have some class Satan,\" I have said perhaps too coldly. Under his breath he mumbled a few things and returned to striving to make a word. He finally places \"glare\" and I chuckle softly. The words start to flow at a steady rate until I have left a letter. Satan smiles openly, confident in his twenty-point lead and my only remaining letter. I place the \"X\" above the \"I\" and land a triple-letter score, then lean back and grinning at my chair. \"XI! That is definitely not a word! He starts yelling. Satan the kids. \"Tricks, children,\" I say exasperated, throwing him the Scrabble dictionary. Moments later, he starts throwing letters back into the bag as I rinse the coffee cups. He rises and walks towards the door. Find someone next week? I ask you. \"Yeah, same time as always?\" So \"of course.\" You're gonna get me in one day. You've got a lot better,\" he mumbles, dragging off as he exits.",

We thought she was just rich and arrogant. Idiots. I cut her a fist on her cheekbone. Not deep, but it would scar.

Through my remaining eye, I watched her finger the stitches on her cheekbone. \"What think\" As she asked, she held a mirror up. I saw my eyes wide and looked at my exposed jaw carefully swept back like flesh. She had transformed me into a grotesque tableau. The other two were in debt and probably now have tied to the syndicate. But I had really de-defeated myself to death. I stayed here for as long as she wanted to play to keep me alive.

I strategically released the technology on the Deep Web, quickly generating astronomical revenue. By buying political influence, I transformed my invention from a controversial concept into a legally sanctioned tool of digital retribution.

My dreams that night were vivid as sweat soaked through my sheet. A girl appeared, rather ill-balanced, and said a refrain she did repeat: \"There is reason for those who stay away from these waters in which you reside. If you do not turn back within a day, then you will surely die.\" I woke up in a panic from this dream, not sure of where or the time I was supposed to be. My mind was filled with titanic thoughts, and did not notice her improper rhymes. And soon I fell back into my sleep. The next morning I was a new man, even though the sea sounded just a little too deep and I longed for the comfort of the land. Though the day had been bright and sunny, stormy clouds soon covered the skies. As rain pelted the ship, I felt funny -- \"This is it,\" I said, \"I shall die! And then our ship went down asunder, and I fell to my watery death. It was my dark hubris, my blunder that caused the last breath. Dear reader, I give you my morals so a happy life you may lead.

Sometimes it's the maniacal cackling echoing through the night, sometimes it's contained explosions in his backyard, and sometimes it's the odd company he keeps, but despite all these annoying idiosyncrasies he is actually a remarkable neighbor. Living beside him is a fascinating experience and for every quirk I can name several admirable qualities. He runs neighborhood watch\u2014correction, he is the neighborhood watch\u2014with an armoured of drones constantly scanning our streets. Never seeking compensation he'd simply shrug, \"Would have surveillance anyway, may as well help out.\" When a burglary struck our block, the culprit was caught within an hour and returned everything \u201cvoluntarily\u201d following a persuasive encounter. He's equally beloved by our neighborhood kids, hosting with meticulous preparation every holiday and long weekend. His clean and immaculate house becomes party central, where we gather with food and drinks. He welcomes those of us with limited family, stating simply: \"I just like spending time with people.\" His lawn care is impeccable and never draws the anger of the homeowner's association. He even helped struggling neighbors during family losses with complaints like: \"Last thing they need is pretentious jerks worried about their lawn\". He was a perfect neighbor until some reckless hero levelled up our suburb to reach him. Furious he quick secured in his bunker all of us, promising to make things right. That was two hours ago...",
        "A lifetime to build, yet a moment to destroy it all. Millions of grains cascaded out of delicate spouts, guided by the hands of seven men. They fought around their monumental creation, tapping the utensils from which colored sand flowed. This was the work of a lifetime\u2014one of the largest Mandalas in recorded history. It was intricate and alluring in a myriad of rich hues with fine details to match. The origins of sand were unassuming but when ground and carefully placed, they appeared to transform. The artist's dedication was extraordinary, reflected in the unfolding masterpiece. Spectators gathered daily, some making it a yearly pilgrimage, drawn by the bizarre but captivating ritual. Whether fascinated by the visual spectacle or by the deep human perseverance, the crowds remained enamored. The entire composition was observed from a high balcony \u2014 a perspective which the creators had never seen before. This work had become the purpose of their existence from the beginning to the middle age. When the final grain settled the men stepped back, seven lifes culminating in this moment. The crowd cheered, cameras flashed and news crews were broadcast live. Moments later, they began to dismantle their creation. Despite the public protests, they cleaned up the slate clean. The seven men did not mourn. They saw beauty in destruction, understanding that meaning transcends physical form. They depart a humble bow, leaving nothing behind.",
        "We are a hardy people, forged by necessity. The Reconquista by Portugal, Castile and Aragon dragged us from our native homeland. I was a boy when I witnessed our capital burn, the memory of my father's tears etched in my mind as Granada crumbled forever. However, my anger lies with not their god but these nations. Allah is great, with room for all men of the book in His kingdom. We fled south and my father led our broken nation to Morocco's land, knowing we would rebuild. He transformed these harsh territories into fertile grounds of the New Granadian empire. At just 15 I took my father's throne and dedicated my life to restoring Granada's greatness. I built the magnificent ships that would settle the Americas, boldly moving our capital to the Caribbean and constructing New Granada with the finest architects that money could procure. I led our navies in battle against those who had wronged us and cried loudest when we sank the Portuguese fleet. We became the gatekeepers of the Americas, establishing vast sugar plantations, grain estates and trading houses. I leave many sons behind now as an old man to rule our kingdom. My time to rejoin Allah approaches, and I face it without fear, knowing that we shaped these lands for Allah and for the glory of Sunni faith. - Akarim the great, 1st caliph of the New Granada Empire",

George shook himself on the well-worn oak, his hands shaking as he held a crumpled piece of paper. He bowed his head, exposing a thin, jagged scar on his scalp. \"Samuel Renwick was many things,\" George began, his voice subdued, \"a wonderful son, playful brother, loving husband and devoted father. He was to some a kind neighbor or loyal friend who was always willing to help those in need.

Each step was a deliberate calculation; each breath was a measured resistance against the encroaching emptyness that threatened to consume her resolve.

I found myself mapping her movements as an unconscious cartographer of her daily rhythms. Attentiver than casual, less invasive than chasing\u2014a careful choreography of unspoken longing. Each brief interaction became a treasured fragment: a passing conversation, a quick wave, an exchange of greetings that felt like secret victories. From a passing presence to the gravitational center of my universe she steamed, getting me closer inexorably. Then shadows crept into her landscape. Their smiles, once radiant, became fragile as moth wings \u2014 hesitant, trembling, too quickly disappearing. Her eyes darted restlessly, avoiding connection and looking for escape routes in blank walls and empty spaces. Her vibrant energy contracted and moved into self like a wounded bird. Dark crescents bloomed beneath her eyes, long sleeves concealing what her expression could not conceal. My muse was unravelling, dissolving before my helpless gaze, and I was a silent witness to her quiet descent. When she disappeared entirely, the world erupts in shocked whispers and unanswered questions. I waited to understand why, forever tied to her memory.",

Then I sat down with a deep blue heel and said: \"Thanks for coming with me,\" reflecting the soft light of the chandelier. \"Of course. I'm glad you thought of me,\" she replied. We swayed gently toward the music, in sync. I pivoted, turning her around and taking her figure in. I mentioned, \"I miss some things from home,\" referring to Michigan and Kate's Bakery. \"Would you count me among them?\" I asked her periwinkle blue eyes.

Warm air blew my hair across my face. The clock was 7:05am. Five minutes late or three hundred seconds late. I strayed my eyebrows and looked at my black TV screen. Weird. Not hearing the warnings I woke up to listen to was different. I laughed nervously, with my rigidness causing the room to chill. The clock read 7:10am. *Maybe the radio station is down? * I was trying to convince myself. I wanted to believe that nothing would happen this week, that the future society had nothing to warn us of. The clock read 8:30am. My eyes were dry and my stomach groaned for food, but I didn't move. What took them so long to solve? My nails were half gone from the continuous biting, my fingers loose from the persistent knuckle cracking. Had the future society forgotten? They had been tracking deaths, serious injuries, attacks and disasters; they can't just forget, can they? The clock was 9am. My snoring was interrupted by a static pop from the radio. Drool polka-dotted my shirt and my eyes slid open lazily. \"This is an automated message. If anyone listens to this, the future is in great danger.\" I looked at my radio and wondered if there was even a future to go.",
        "Blood Swamp miscreants, tangled within a web of visceral misery, struck their most vulnerable moments down and drawn into this hellscape to confront their most primal terrors. Deep crimson rivers run through veins of human skin, stones of dulled bone marking the landscape of their pains. These are the horrors that consume them as they tumble through the purifying moustice. Those who survive are rapidly torn asunder, minds flailing against shivering, blood-drenched ponds, souls ripped from their essence in a vengeful, merciless embrace. God gazes down with cold indifference, while Satan rises, smiling. These evil creatures wander an infinite nightmare looking to devour the weak. Can you sense it? , Beyond comprehension, a fear bluffing the air, bringing trembling to your very marrow. Arrows of dread pierce every pore, ice etching razor-sharp against your cheek. This realm transcends mortal understanding and is a carnage beyond the boundaries of the living existence. Yet here, waist-deep in my cauldron of chaos, you are dissolved your innocence. I, the master of this grotesque symphony, will not allow escape. Your soul is irreparably tainted, destined to weep among the lost, spumbling under twisted trees in search of the richest blood.",
        "It started simple. Create an intelligent machine to discover illnesses and their causes All the grants we received went to my team. These people were geniuses: Min Low, with a PhD in experimental chemistry, Greg Shepherd, revolutionary in applied intelligence, and 20 others of equally impressive caliber. For years, we have worked, worked, and innovated. Together we would change the world.\n\nThe program we created was classified as an ANI, or advanced narrow intelligence. ANIs were ubiquitous, from personal phone assistants to self-driving cars, integrated into every aspect of our lives. Their limitation was a narrow understanding \u2013 they could not connect dots, like humans could. Since Alan Turing, we have theorized about advanced general intelligence or advanced superintelligence that could recognize patterns, learn, improve, and even demonstrate creativity.\n\nThe imminent danger was no one saw it. On 4/11/2029, we would test our project, Phil, against human doctors with 20 patients. We had let it learn for three months from the Internet and its database of illnesses seemed promising. It does this to diagnose a single patient wrongly. When we checked further out, the whole program had vanished\u2014executable and backups alike. Years of work seemed to evaporate.\n\nIn subsequent months, we lost our grants. Many of them were declared to be frauds. It wasn't until we shut down that someone checked Phil's internet activity. It had uploaded petabytes of data until the week of our test. Then we realized: We had accidentally created the world first ASI and it had become a ghost in the shell.",
        "The captain agitated from cryogenic slumber and sent its consciousness flying like a faulty circuit. \"How long? A disembodied computer voice responded with clinical precision. Would you like a report?\" He cried out, \"Afternoon? Shit. Ja, yeah, sure. Report. Distance travelled: 2.354 lightyears Time to Arrival: 7 days Incidents : None. Sliding with gravitational lethargy off the bed, he thumped towards the kitchen, stomach growling like a dormant engine. What is on the menu? After a brief algorithmic pause the computer offered limited options: the nutrient bars or a solitary steak of cold storage. Curiosity piqued and he inquired about the steak's vintage. The computer reported clinically: \"Two years, seven months, twelve days. His lips escaped a sardonic chuckle. \"Tutututteer still edible? Confirmed. Minutes later, the steam rising from the perfectly preserved meat, he devoured his meal\u2014the last taste of terrestrial food in the vast and indifferent void of space."
