        "In 1954, major Serbian and Croatian writers, linguists and literary critics, backed by Matica srpska and Matica hrvatska signed the Novi Sad Agreement, which in its first conclusion stated: \"Serbs, Croats and Montenegrins share a single language with two equal variants that have developed around Zagreb (western) and Belgrade (eastern)\". The agreement insisted on the equal status of Cyrillic and Latin scripts, and of Ekavian and Ijekavian pronunciations. It also specified that Serbo-Croatian should be the name of the language in official contexts, while in unofficial use the traditional Serbian and Croatian were to be retained. Matica hrvatska and Matica srpska were to work together on a dictionary, and a committee of Serbian and Croatian linguists was asked to prepare a pravopis. During the sixties both books were published simultaneously in Ijekavian Latin in Zagreb and Ekavian Cyrillic in Novi Sad. Yet Croatian linguists claim that it was an act of unitarianism. The evidence supporting this claim is patchy: Croatian linguist Stjepan Babi\u0107 complained that the television transmission from Belgrade always used the Latin alphabet\u2014 which was true, but was not proof of unequal rights, but of frequency of use and prestige. Babi\u0107 further complained that the Novi Sad Dictionary (1967) listed side by side words from both the Croatian and Serbian variants wherever they differed, which one can view as proof of careful respect for both variants, and not of unitarism. Moreover, Croatian linguists criticized those parts of the Dictionary for being unitaristic that were written by",
        "The Bush administration then turned its attention to Iraq, and argued the need to remove Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq had become urgent. Among the stated reasons were that Saddam's regime had tried to acquire nuclear material and had not properly accounted for biological and chemical material it was known to have previously possessed, and believed to still maintain. Both the possession of these weapons of mass destruction (WMD), and the failure to account for them, would violate the U.N. sanctions. The assertion about WMD was hotly advanced by the Bush administration from the beginning, but other major powers including China, France, Germany, and Russia remained unconvinced that Iraq was a threat and refused to allow passage of a UN Security Council resolution to authorize the use of force. Iraq permitted UN weapon inspectors in November 2002, who were continuing their work to assess the WMD claim when the Bush administration decided to proceed with war without UN authorization and told the inspectors to leave the country. The United States invaded Iraq on March 20, 2003, along with a \"coalition of the willing\" that consisted of additional troops from the United Kingdom, and to a lesser extent, from Australia and Poland.

        "An adolescent's environment plays a huge role in their identity development. While most adolescent studies are conducted on white, middle class children, studies show that the more privileged upbringing people have, the more successfully they develop their identity. The forming of an adolescent's identity is a crucial time in their life. It has been recently found that demographic patterns suggest that the transition to adulthood is now occurring over a longer span of years than was the case during the middle of the 20th century. Accordingly, youth, a period that spans late adolescence and early adulthood, has become a more prominent stage of the life course. This therefore has caused various factors to become important during this development. So many factors contribute to the developing social identity of an adolescent from commitment, to coping",
        "Compared to other team sports, the National Football League preseason is very structured. Every NFL team plays exactly four pre-season exhibition games a year, two at home and two away, with the exception of two teams each year who play a fifth game, the Pro Football Hall of Fame Game. These exhibition games, most of which are held in the month of August, are played for the purpose of helping coaches narrow down the roster from the offseason limit of 90 players to the regular-season limit of 53 players. While the scheduling formula is not as rigid for preseason games as they are for the regular season, there are numerous restrictions and traditions that limit the choices of preseason opponents; teams are also restricted on what days and times they can play these games. Split-squad games, a practice common in baseball and hockey, where a team that is scheduled to play two games on the same day splits their team into two squads, are prohibited. The NFL has played exhibition games in Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia (including the American Bowl in 1999) and Mexico to spread the",
        "In practice, not all rule violations will result in a disqualification as the referee may use their own judgement and is not obligated to stop the match. Usually, the only offenses that the referee will see and immediately disqualify the match on (as opposed to having multiple offenses) are low blows, weapon usage, interference, or assaulting the referee. In WWE, a referee must see the violation with their own eyes to rule that the match end in a disqualification (simply watching the video tape is not usually enough) and the referee's ruling is almost always final, although Dusty finishes (named after, and made famous by, Dusty Rhodes) will often result in the referee's decision being overturned. It is not uncommon for the referees themselves to get knocked out during a match, which is commonly referred to by the term \"ref bump\". While the referee remains \"unconscious\", wrestlers are free to violate rules until the referee is revived or replaced. In some cases, a referee might disqualify a person under the presumption that it was that wrestler who knocked them out; most referee knockouts are arranged to allow a wrestler, usually a heel, to gain an advantage. For example, a wrestler may get whipped into a referee",
        "In the 15th century the dome was added and the naves extended back of the choir, uniting the building to the tower and forming a main entrance. Archbishop Luis Alfonso de los Cameros began the building of the main chapel in 1674; the walls were decorated with marbles and bronzes in the Baroque style of that period. At the beginning of the 18th century the German Conrad Rudolphus built the fa\u00e7ade of the main entrance. The other two doors lead into the transept; one, that of the Apostles in pure pointed Gothic, dates from the 14th century, the other is that of the Pal\u00e1u. The additions made to the back of the cathedral detract from its height. The 18th-century restoration rounded the pointed arches, covered the Gothic columns with Corinthian pillars, and redecorated the walls. The dome has no lantern, its plain ceiling being pierced by two large side windows. There are four chapels on either side, besides that at the end and those that open into the choir, the transept, and the sanctuary. It contains many paintings by eminent artists. A silver reredos, which was behind the altar, was carried away in the war of 1808, and converted into coin to meet the expenses of the campaign. There are two paintings by Francisco Goya in the San Francesco chapel. Behind the Chapel of the",
        "Early reviews were mixed in their assessment. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly considered that \"As TV, American Idol is crazily entertaining; as music, it's dust-mote inconsequential\". Others, however, thought that \"the most striking aspect of the series was the genuine talent it revealed\". It was also described as a \"sadistic musical bake-off\", and \"a romp in humiliation\". Other aspects of the show have attracted criticisms. The product placement in the show in particular was noted, and some critics were harsh about what they perceived as its blatant commercial calculations \u2013 Karla Peterson of The San Diego Union-Tribune charged that American Idol is \"a conniving multimedia monster\" that has \"absorbed the sin of our debauched culture and spit them out in a lump of reconstituted evil\". The decision to send the season one winner to sing the national anthem at the Lincoln Memorial on the first anniversary of the September 11 attacks in 2002 was also poorly received by many.

Don't worry if it's not true\u2014so long as there's not too much of a fuss about it afterwards.\" Newspaper editor Donald Trelford wrote in The Observer of 21 September 1986: \"The royal soap opera has now reached such a pitch of public interest that the boundary between fact and fiction has been lost sight of ... it is not just that some papers don't check their facts or accept denials: they don't care if the stories are true or not.\" It was reported, most notably in The Sunday Times of 20 July 1986, that the Queen was worried that Margaret Thatcher's economic policies fostered social divisions and was alarmed by high unemployment, a series of riots, the violence of a miners' strike, and Thatcher's refusal",

The Kangxi Emperor was able to successfully expel Galdan's invading forces from these regions, which were then incorporated into the empire. Galdan was eventually killed in the Dzungar\u2013Qing War. In 1683, Qing forces received the surrender of Taiwan from Zheng Keshuang, grandson of Koxinga, who had conquered Taiwan from the Dutch colonists as a base against the Qing. Zheng Keshuang was awarded the title \"Duke Haicheng\" (\u6d77\u6f84\u516c) and was inducted into the Han Chinese Plain Red Banner of the Eight Banners when he moved to Beijing. Several Ming princes had accompanied Koxinga to Taiwan in 1661-1662, including the Prince of Ningjing Zhu Shugui and Prince Zhu Honghuan (\u6731\u5f18\u6853), son of Zhu Yihai, where they lived in the Kingdom of Tungning. The Qing sent the 17 Ming princes still living on Taiwan in 1683 back to mainland China where they spent the rest of their lives in exile since their lives were spared from execution. Winning Taiwan freed Kangxi's forces for series of battles over Albazin, the far eastern outpost of the Tsardom of Russia. Zheng's former soldiers on Taiwan like the rattan shield troops were also inducted into the Eight Banners and used by the Qing against Russian Cossacks",

        "Libya's economy witnessed increasing privatization; although rejecting the socialist policies of nationalized industry advocated in The Green Book, government figures asserted that they were forging \"people's socialism\" rather than capitalism. Gaddafi welcomed these reforms, calling for wide-scale privatization in a March 2003 speech. In 2003, the oil industry was largely sold to private corporations, and by 2004, there was $40 billion of direct foreign investment in Libya, a sixfold rise over 2003. Sectors of Libya's population reacted against these reforms with public demonstrations, and in March 2006, revolutionary hard-liners took control of the GPC cabinet; although scaling back the pace of the changes, they did not halt them. In 2010, plans were announced that would have seen half the Libyan economy privatized over the following decade. While there was no accompanying political liberalization, with Gaddafi retaining",
        "Mammalian hair, also known as pelage, can vary in color between populations, organisms within a population, and even on the individual organism. Light-dark color variation is common in the mammalian taxa. Sometimes, this color variation is determined by age variation, however, in other cases, it is determined by other factors. Selective pressures, such as ecological interactions with other populations or environmental conditions, often lead to the variation in mammalian coloration. These selective pressures favor certain colors in order to increase survival. Camouflage is thought to be a major selection pressure shaping coloration in mammals, although there is also evidence that sexual selection, communication, and physiological processes may influence the evolution of coloration as well. Camouflage is the most predominant mechanism for color variation, as it aids in the concealment of the organisms from predators or from their prey. Coat color can also be for intraspecies communication such as warning members of their species about predators, indicating health for reproductive purposes, communicating between mother and young, and",
        "But in the mid-18th century, during the French Enlightenment, a more ideological use of the term had come into use. In 1765, the author of an anonymous article in a French Enlightenment periodical spoke of \"The general love of humanity ... a virtue hitherto quite nameless among us, and which we will venture to call 'humanism', for the time has come to create a word for such a beautiful and necessary thing\". The latter part of the 18th and the early 19th centuries saw the creation of numerous grass-roots \"philanthropic\" and benevolent societies dedicated to human betterment and the spreading of knowledge (some Christian, some not). After the French Revolution, the idea that human virtue could be created by human reason alone independently from traditional religious institutions, attributed by opponents of the Revolution to Enlightenment philosophes such as Rousseau, was violently attacked by influential religious and political conservatives, such as Edmund Burke and Joseph de Maistre, as a deification or idolatry of humanity. Humanism began to acquire a negative sense. The Oxford English Dictionary records the use of the word \"humanism\" by an English clergyman in 1812 to indicate those who believe in the \"mere humanity\" (as opposed to the divine nature) of Christ, i.e., Unitarians and Deists. In this polarised atmosphere, in which established ecclesiastical bodies tended to circle the wagons and reflexively",

This has been an emerging trend in the politics of the Republic of Ireland since the 1980s and is almost always the case in Germany on national and state level, and in most constituencies at the communal level. Furthermore, since the forming of the Republic of Iceland there has never been a government not led by a coalition (usually of the Independence Party and one other (often the Social Democratic Alliance). A similar situation exists in the Republic of Ireland; since 1989, no one party has held power on its own. Since then, numerous coalition governments have been formed.

        "Emotions can motivate social interactions and relationships and therefore are directly related with basic physiology, particularly with the stress systems. This is important because emotions are related to the anti-stress complex, with an oxytocin-attachment system, which plays a major role in bonding. Emotional phenotype temperaments affect social connectedness and fitness in complex social systems (Kurt Kortschal 2013). These characteristics are shared with other species and taxa and are due to the effects of genes and their continuous transmission. Information that is encoded in the DNA sequences provides the blueprint for assembling proteins that make up our cells. Zygotes require genetic information from their parental germ cells, and at every speciation event, heritable traits that have enabled its ancestor to survive and reproduce successfully are passed down along with new traits that could be potentially beneficial to the offspring. In the five million years since the linages leading to modern humans and chimpanzees split, only about 1.2% of their genetic material has been modified. This suggests that everything that separates us from chimpanzees must be encoded in that very small amount of DNA, including our behaviors. Students that study animal behaviors have only identified intraspecific examples of gene-dependent behavioral phenotypes. In voles (Microtus spp.) minor genetic differences have been identified in a vasopressin receptor gene that corresponds to major species differences",

        "Jeffrey Long and Rick Kittles give a long critique of the application of FST to human populations in their 2003 paper \"Human Genetic Diversity and the Nonexistence of Biological Races\". They find that the figure of 85% is misleading because it implies that all human populations contain on average 85% of all genetic diversity. They claim that this does not correctly reflect human population history, because it treats all human groups as independent. A more realistic portrayal of the way human groups are related is to understand that some human groups are parental to other groups and that these groups represent paraphyletic groups to their descent groups. For example, under the recent African origin theory the human population in Africa is paraphyletic to all other human groups because it represents the ancestral group from which all non-African populations derive, but more than that, non-African groups only derive from a small non-representative sample of this African",
        "The book was widely translated in Darwin's lifetime, but problems arose with translating concepts and metaphors, and some translations were biased by the translator's own agenda. Darwin distributed presentation copies in France and Germany, hoping that suitable applicants would come forward, as translators were expected to make their own arrangements with a local publisher. He welcomed the distinguished elderly naturalist and geologist Heinrich Georg Bronn, but the German translation published in 1860 imposed Bronn's own ideas, adding controversial themes that Darwin had deliberately omitted. Bronn translated \"favoured races\" as \"perfected races\", and added essays on issues including the origin of life, as well as a final chapter on religious implications partly inspired by Bronn's adherence to Naturphilosophie. In 1862, Bronn produced a second edition based on the third English edition and Darwin's suggested additions, but then died of a heart attack. Darwin corresponded closely with Julius Victor Carus, who published an improved translation in 1867. Darwin's attempts to find a translator",
        "Hegel certainly intends to preserve what he takes to be true of German idealism, in particular Kant's insistence that ethical reason can and does go beyond finite inclinations. For Hegel there must be some identity of thought and being for the \"subject\" (any human observer)) to be able to know any observed \"object\" (any external entity, possibly even another human) at all. Under Hegel's concept of \"subject-object identity,\" subject and object both have Spirit (Hegel's ersatz, redefined, nonsupernatural \"God\") as their conceptual (not metaphysical) inner reality\u2014and in that sense are identical. But until Spirit's \"self-realization\" occurs and Spirit graduates from Spirit to Absolute Spirit status, subject (a human mind) mistakenly thinks every \"object\" it observes is something \"alien,\" meaning something separate or apart from \"subject.\" In Hegel's words, \"The object is revealed to it [to \"subject\"] by [as] something alien, and it does not recognize itself.\" Self-realization occurs when Hegel (part of Spirit's nonsupernatural Mind, which is the collective mind of all humans) arrives on the scene and realizes that every \"object\"",

In 587 BC Nebuchadnezzar II, King of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, besieged Jerusalem, destroyed the First Temple, and deported the most prominent citizens of Judah. In 586 BC, Judah itself ceased to be an independent kingdom, and its remaining Jews were left stateless.

        "Zhejiang's main manufacturing sectors are electromechanical industries, textiles, chemical industries, food, and construction materials. In recent years Zhejiang has followed its own development model, dubbed the \"Zhejiang model\", which is based on prioritizing and encouraging entrepreneurship, an emphasis on small businesses responsive to the whims of the market, large public investments into infrastructure, and the production of low-cost goods in bulk for both domestic consumption and export. As a result, Zhejiang has made itself one of the richest provinces, and the \"Zhejiang spirit\" has become something of a legend within China. However, some economists now worry that this model is not sustainable, in that it is inefficient and places unreasonable demands on raw materials and public utilities, and also a dead end, in that the myriad small businesses in Zhejiang producing cheap goods in bulk are unable to move to more sophisticated or technologically more advanced industries. The economic heart of Zhejiang is moving from North Zhejiang, centered on Hangzhou, southeastward to the region centered on Wenzhou and Taizhou.",

Anthropomorphic figurines have been found in the Balkans from 6000 BC, and in Central Europe by c. 5800 BC (La Hoguette). Among the earliest cultural complexes of this area are the Sesklo culture in Thessaly, which later expanded in the Balkans giving rise to Star\u010devo-K\u00f6r\u00f6s (Cris), Linearbandkeramik, and Vin\u010da. Through a combination of cultural diffusion and migration of peoples, the Neolithic traditions spread west and northwards to reach northwestern Europe by around 4500 BC. The Vin\u010da culture may have created the earliest system of writing, the Vin\u010da signs, though archaeologist Shan Winn believes they most likely represented pictograms and ideograms rather than a truly developed form of writing. The Cucuteni-Trypillian culture built enormous settlements in Romania, Moldova and Ukraine from 5300 to 2300 BC.

        "Strict separation of powers did not operate in The United Kingdom, the political structure of which served in most instances[citation needed] as a model for the government created by the U.S. Constitution.[citation needed] Under the UK Westminster system, based on parliamentary sovereignty and responsible government, Parliament (consisting of the Sovereign (King-in-Parliament), House of Lords and House of Commons) was the supreme lawmaking authority. The executive branch acted in the name of the King (\"His Majesty's Government\"), as did the judiciary. The King's Ministers were in most cases members of one of the two Houses of Parliament, and the Government needed to sustain the support of a majority in the House of Commons. One minister, the Lord Chancellor, was at the same time the sole judge in the Court of Chancery and the presiding officer in the House of Lords. Therefore, it may be seen that the three branches of British government often violated the strict principle of separation of powers, even though there were many occasions when the different branches of the government disagreed with each other. Some U.S. states did not observe a strict separation of powers in the 18th century. In New Jersey, the Governor also functioned as a member of the state's highest court and as the presiding officer of one house of the New Jersey Legislature.

Most of this range is forested and the Gro\u00dfer Beerberg (983 m) is Thuringia's highest mountain. To the south-west, the Forest is followed up by Werra river valley, dividing it from the Rh\u00f6n Mountains in the west and the Grabfeld plain in the south. Eastern Thuringia, commonly described as the area east of Saale and Loquitz valley, is marked by a hilly landscape, rising slowly from the flat north to the mountainous south. The Saale in the west and the Wei\u00dfe Elster in the east are the two big rivers running from south to north and forming densely settled valleys in this area. Between them lies the flat and forested",
        "Throughout the 14th century, French kings sought to expand their influence at the expense of the territorial holdings of the nobility. They ran into difficulties when attempting to confiscate the holdings of the English kings in southern France, leading to the Hundred Years' War, waged from 1337 to 1453. Early in the war the English under Edward III (r. 1327\u201377) and his son Edward, the Black Prince (d. 1376),[AF] won the battles of Cr\u00e9cy and Poitiers, captured the city of Calais, and won control of much of France.[AG] The resulting stresses almost caused the disintegration of the French kingdom during the early years of the war. In the early 15th century, France again came close to dissolving, but in the late 1420s the military successes of Joan of Arc (d. 1431) led to the victory of the French and the capture of the last English possessions in southern France in 1453. The price was high, as the population of France at the end of the Wars was likely",
        "The Jurassic Period extends from about 201.3 \u00b1 0.2 to 145.0 Ma. During the early Jurassic, the supercontinent Pangaea broke up into the northern supercontinent Laurasia and the southern supercontinent Gondwana; the Gulf of Mexico opened in the new rift between North America and what is now Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. The Jurassic North Atlantic Ocean was relatively narrow, while the South Atlantic did not open until the following Cretaceous Period, when Gondwana itself rifted apart. The Tethys Sea closed, and the Neotethys basin appeared. Climates were warm, with no evidence of glaciation. As in the Triassic, there was apparently no land near either pole, and no extensive ice caps existed. The Jurassic geological record is good in western Europe, where extensive marine sequences indicate a time when much of the continent was submerged under shallow tropical seas; famous locales include the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site and the renowned late Jurassic lagerst\u00e4tten of Holzmaden and Solnhofen. In contrast, the North American Jurassic record is the poorest of the Mesozoic, with few outcrops at the surface.",

The Ottoman sultan, p\u00e2di\u015f\u00e2h or \"lord of kings\", served as the Empire's sole regent and was considered to be the embodiment of its government, though he did not always exercise complete control. The Imperial Harem was one of the most important powers of the Ottoman court. It was ruled by the Valide Sultan. On occasion, the Valide Sultan would become involved in state politics. For a time, the women of the Harem effectively controlled the state in what was termed the \"Sultanate of Women\". New sultans were always chosen from the sons of the previous sultan. The strong educational system of the palace school was geared towards eliminating the unfit potential heirs, and establishing support among the ruling elite for a successor. The palace schools, which would also educate the future administrators of the state, were not a single track. First, the Madrasa (Ottoman Turkish: Medrese\u200e) was designated for the Muslims, and educated scholars and state officials according to Islamic tradition. The financial burden of the Medrese was supported",

However, they discover that the mirror is broken. The Sages there explain that Zant tried to destroy it, but he was only able to shatter it into fragments; only the true ruler of the Twili can completely destroy the Mirror of Twilight.

        "In 1718, at the behest of either Rector Samuel Andrew or the colony's Governor Gurdon Saltonstall, Cotton Mather contacted a successful businessman named Elihu Yale, who lived in Wales but had been born in Boston and whose father, David, had been one of the original settlers in New Haven, to ask him for financial help in constructing a new building for the college. Through the persuasion of Jeremiah Dummer, Yale, who had made a fortune through trade while living in Madras as a representative of the East India Company, donated nine bales of goods, which were sold for more than \u00a3560, a substantial sum at the time. Cotton Mather suggested that the school change its name to Yale College. Meanwhile, a Harvard graduate working in England convinced some 180 prominent intellectuals that they should donate books to Yale. The 1714 shipment of 500 books represented the best of modern English literature, science, philosophy and theology. It had a profound effect on intellectuals at Yale.

        "Despite efforts to revive Hebrew as the national language of the Jewish people, knowledge of the language is not commonly possessed by Jews worldwide and English has emerged as the lingua franca of the Jewish diaspora. Although many Jews once had sufficient knowledge of Hebrew to study the classic literature, and Jewish languages like Yiddish and Ladino were commonly used as recently as the early 20th century, most Jews lack such knowledge today and English has by and large superseded most Jewish vernaculars. The three most commonly spoken languages among Jews today are Hebrew, English, and Russian. Some Romance languages, particularly French and Spanish, are also widely used. Yiddish has been spoken by more Jews in history than any other language, but it is far less used today following the Holocaust and the adoption of Modern Hebrew by the Zionist movement and the State of Israel. In some places, the mother language of the Jewish community differs from that of the general population or the dominant group. For example, in Quebec, the Ashkenazic majority has adopted English, while the Sephardic minority uses French as its primary language. Similarly, South African Jews adopted English rather than Afrikaans. Due to both Czarist and Soviet policies, Russian has superseded Yiddish as the language of Russian Jews, but these policies have also affected neighboring communities. Today, Russian is the first language for many Jewish communities in a",
        "The area now called Galicia was first inhabited by humans during the Middle Paleolithic period, and it takes its name from the Gallaeci, the Celtic peoples living north of the Douro river during the last millennium BC, in a region largely coincidental with that of the Iron Age local Castro culture. Galicia was incorporated into the Roman Empire at the end of the Cantabrian Wars in 19 BC, being turned into a Roman province in the 3rd century AD. In 410, the Germanic Suebi established a kingdom with its capital in Braga (Portugal) which was incorporated into that of the Visigoths in 585. In 711, the Arabs invaded the Iberian Peninsula, taking the Visigoth kingdom, but soon in 740 Galicia was incorporated into the Christian kingdom of Asturias. During the Middle Ages, the kingdom of Galicia was occasionally ruled by its own kings, but most of the time it was leagued to the kingdom of Leon and later to that of Castile, while maintaining its own legal and customary practices and personality. From the 13th century on, the kings of Castile, as kings of Galicia, appointed an Adiantado-m\u00f3r, whose attributions passed to the Governor and Captain General of the Kingdom of Galiza from the last years of the 15th century.

        "Birds have a very efficient system for diffusing oxygen into the blood; birds have a ten times greater surface area to gas exchange volume than mammals. As a result, birds have more blood in their capillaries per unit of volume of lung than a mammal. The arteries are composed of thick elastic muscles to withstand the pressure of the ventricular constriction, and become more rigid as they move away from the heart. Blood moves through the arteries, which undergo vasoconstriction, and into arterioles which act as a transportation system to distribute primarily oxygen as well as nutrients to all tissues of the body. As the arterioles move away from the heart and into individual organs and tissues they are further divided to increase surface area and slow blood flow. Travelling through the arterioles blood moves into the capillaries where gas exchange can occur. Capillaries are organized into capillary beds in tissues, it is here that blood exchanges oxygen for carbon dioxide waste. In the capillary beds blood flow is slowed to allow maximum diffusion",

The College Dropout received near-universal critical acclaim from contemporary music critics, was voted the top album of the year by two major music publications, and has consistently been ranked among the great hip-hop works and debut albums by artists. \"Jesus Walks\", the album's fourth single, perhaps exposed West to a wider audience; the song's subject matter concerns faith and Christianity. The song nevertheless reached the top 20 of the Billboard pop charts, despite industry executives' predictions that a song containing such blatant declarations of faith would never make it to radio. The College Dropout would eventually be certified triple platinum in the US, and garnered West 10 Grammy nominations, including Album of the Year, and Best Rap Album (which it received). During this period, West also founded GOOD Music, a record label and management company that would go on to house affiliate artists and producers, such as No I.D. and John Legend.

        "As anticipated by Nimitz, the Japanese fleet arrived off Midway on 4 June and was spotted by PBY patrol aircraft. Nagumo executed a first strike against Midway, while Fletcher launched his aircraft, bound for Nagumo's carriers. At 09:20 the first U.S. carrier aircraft arrived, TBD Devastator torpedo bombers from Hornet, but their attacks were poorly coordinated and ineffectual; thanks in part to faulty aerial torpedoes, they failed to score a single hit and all 15 were wiped out by defending Zero fighters. At 09:35, 15 additional TBDs from Enterprise attacked in which 14 were lost, again with no hits. Thus far, Fletcher's attacks had been disorganized and seemingly ineffectual, but they succeeded in drawing Nagumo's defensive fighters down to sea level where they expended much of their fuel and ammunition repulsing the two waves of torpedo bombers. As a result, when U.S. dive bombers arrived at high altitude, the Zeros were poorly positioned to defend. To make matters worse, Nagumo's four carriers had drifted out of formation in their efforts to avoid torpedoes, reducing the concentration of their anti-aircraft fire. Nagumo's indecision had also created confusion aboard his carriers. Alerted to the need of a second strike on Midway, but also wary of the need to deal with the American carriers that he now knew were in",

He was forced to flee to Scandinavia in 976 after his half-brother Yaropolk had murdered his other brother Oleg and taken control of Rus. In Scandinavia, with the help of his relative Earl H\u00e5kon Sigurdsson, ruler of Norway, Vladimir assembled a Viking army and reconquered Novgorod and Kiev from Yaropolk. As Prince of Kiev, Vladimir's most notable achievement was the Christianization of Kievan Rus', a process that began in 988. The Primary Chronicle states that when Vladimir had decided to accept a new faith instead of the traditional idol-worship (paganism) of the Slavs, he sent out some of his most valued advisors and warriors as emissaries to different parts of Europe. They visited the Christians of the Latin Rite, the Jews, and",
        "Identity development is a stage in the adolescent life cycle. For most, the search for identity begins in the adolescent years. During these years, adolescents are more open to 'trying on' different behaviours and appearances to discover who they are. In other words, in an attempt to find their identity and discover who they are adolescents are liking to cycle through a number of identities to find one that suits them best. But, developing and maintaining identity (in adolescent years) is a difficult task due to multiple factors such as family life, environment, and social status. Empirical studies suggest that this process might be more accurately described as identity development, rather than formation, but confirms a normative process of change in both content and structure of one's thoughts about the self. The two main aspects of identity development are self-clarity and self-esteem. Since choices made during adolescent years can influence later life, high levels of self-awareness and self-control during mid-adolescence will lead to better decisions during the transition to adulthood.[citation needed] Researchers have used three general approaches to understanding identity development: self-concept, sense of identity, and self-esteem. The years of adolescence create a more conscientious group of young adults. Adolescents pay close attention and give more",
        "Athanasius recounts being a student, as well as being educated by the Martyrs of the Great (tenth) and last persecution of Christianity by pagan Rome.[citation needed] This persecution was most severe in the East, particularly in Egypt and Palestine. Peter of Alexandria, the 17th archbishop of Alexandria, was martyred in 311 in the closing days of that persecution, and may have been one of those teachers. His successor as bishop of Alexandria, Alexander of Alexandria (312\u2013328) was an Origenist as well as a documented mentor of Athanasius. According to Sozomen, Bishop Alexander \"invited Athanasius to be his commensal and secretary. He had been well educated, and was versed in grammar and rhetoric, and had already, while still a young man, and before reaching the episcopate, given proof to those who dwelt with him of his wisdom and acumen\". Athanasius's earliest work, Against the Heathen \u2013 On the Incarnation (written before 319), bears traces of Origenist Alexandrian thought (such as repeatedly quoting Plato and used a definition from Aristotle's Organon) but in an orthodox way. Athanasius was also familiar with the theories of various philosophical schools, and in particular with the",
        "Egocentrism in adolescents forms a self-conscious desire to feel important in their peer groups and enjoy social acceptance. Unlike the conflicting aspects of self-concept, identity represents a coherent sense of self stable across circumstances and including past experiences and future goals. Everyone has a self-concept, whereas Erik Erikson argued that not everyone fully achieves identity. Erikson's theory of stages of development includes the identity crisis in which adolescents must explore different possibilities and integrate different parts of themselves before committing to their beliefs. He described the resolution of this process as a stage of \"identity achievement\" but also stressed that the identity challenge \"is never fully resolved once and for all at one point in time\". Adolescents begin by defining themselves based on their crowd membership. \"Clothes help teens explore new identities, separate from parents, and bond with peers.\" Fashion has played a major role when it comes to teenagers \"finding their selves\"; Fashion is always evolving, which corresponds with the evolution of change in the personality of teenagers. Adolescents attempt to define their identity by consciously styling themselves in different manners to find what best suits them. Trial and error in matching both their perceived image and the image others respond to and see, allows for the adolescent to grasp an understanding of who they are Just as",
        "Stanley Schachter formulated his theory on the earlier work of a Spanish physician, Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n, who injected patients with epinephrine and subsequently asked them how they felt. Interestingly, Mara\u00f1\u00f3n found that most of these patients felt something but in the absence of an actual emotion-evoking stimulus, the patients were unable to interpret their physiological arousal as an experienced emotion. Schachter did agree that physiological reactions played a big role in emotions. He suggested that physiological reactions contributed to emotional experience by facilitating a focused cognitive appraisal of a given physiologically arousing event and that this appraisal was what defined the subjective emotional experience. Emotions were thus a result of two-stage process: general physiological arousal, and experience of emotion. For example, the physiological arousal, heart pounding, in a response to an evoking stimulus, the sight of a bear in the kitchen. The brain then quickly scans the area, to explain the pounding, and notices the bear. Consequently, the brain interprets the pounding heart as being the result of fearing the bear. With",

The Manchus' continued dominance was ensured by an ethnic quota for top bureaucratic appointments. Hong Taiji's reign also saw a fundamental change of policy towards his Han Chinese subjects. Nurhaci had treated Han in Liaodong differently according to how much grain they had, those with less than 5 to 7 sin were treated like chattel while those with more than that amount were rewarded with property. Due to a revolt by Han in Liaodong in 1623, Nurhachi, who previously gave concessions to conquered Han subjects in Liaodong, turned against them and ordered that they no longer be trusted; He enacted discriminatory policies and killings against them, while ordering that Han who assimilated to the Jurchen (in Jilin) before 1619 be treated equally as Jurchens were and not like the conquered Han in Liaodong. Hong Taiji instead incorporated them into the Jurchen \"nation\" as full (if not first-class) citizens, obligated to provide military service. By 1648, less than one-sixth of the bannermen were of Manchu ancestry. This change of policy not only increased Hong Taiji's manpower and reduced his military dependence on banners not under",

In most Jewish populations, these male line ancestors appear to have been mainly Middle Eastern. For example, Ashkenazi Jews share more common paternal lineages with other Jewish and Middle Eastern groups than with non-Jewish populations in areas where Jews lived in Eastern Europe, Germany and the French Rhine Valley. This is consistent with Jewish traditions in placing most Jewish paternal origins in the region of the Middle East. Conversely, the maternal lineages of Jewish populations, studied by looking at mitochondrial DNA, are generally more heterogeneous. Scholars such as Harry Ostrer and Raphael Falk believe this indicates that many Jewish males found new mates from European and other communities in the places where they migrated in the diaspora after fleeing ancient Israel. In contrast, Behar has found evidence that about 40% of Ashkenazi",

        "In contemporary society, adolescents also face some risks as their sexuality begins to transform. While some of these, such as emotional distress (fear of abuse or exploitation) and sexually transmitted infections/diseases (STIs/STDs), including HIV/AIDS, are not necessarily inherent to adolescence, others such as teenage pregnancy (through non-use or failure of contraceptives) are seen as social problems in most western societies. One in four sexually active teenagers will contract an STI. Adolescents in the United States often chose \"anything but intercourse\" for sexual activity because they mistakenly believe it reduces the risk of STIs. Across the country, clinicians report rising diagnoses of herpes and human papillomavirus (HPV), which can cause genital warts, and is now thought to affect 15 percent of the teen population.

There is effectively no ethnic distinction between black and white Bermudians, other than those characterising recent immigrant communities. In the 17th century, this was not so. For the first hundred years of settlement, white Protestants of English heritage were the distinct majority, with white minorities of Irish (the native language of many of whom can be assumed to have been Gaelic) and Scots sent to Bermuda after the English invasions of their homelands that followed the English Civil War. Non-white minorities included Spanish-speaking, free (indentured) blacks from the West Indies, black chattel slaves primarily captured from Spanish and Portuguese ships by Bermudian privateers, and Native Americans, primarily from the Algonquian and other tribes of the Atlantic seaboard, but possibly from as far away as Mexico. By the 19th century, the white ethnically-English Bermudians had lost their numerical advantage.

        "The body\u2019s capability to react to antigen depends on a person's age, antigen type, maternal factors and the area where the antigen is presented. Neonates are said to be in a state of physiological immunodeficiency, because both their innate and adaptive immunological responses are greatly suppressed. Once born, a child\u2019s immune system responds favorably to protein antigens while not as well to glycoproteins and polysaccharides. In fact, many of the infections acquired by neonates are caused by low virulence organisms like Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas. In neonates, opsonic activity and the ability to activate the complement cascade is very limited. For example, the mean level of C3 in a newborn is approximately 65% of that found in the adult. Phagocytic activity is also greatly impaired in newborns. This is due to lower opsonic activity, as well as diminished up-regulation of integrin and selectin receptors, which limit the ability of neutrophils to interact with adhesion molecules in the endothelium. Their monocytes are slow and have a reduced ATP production, which also limits the newborn's phagocytic activity. Although, the number of total lymphocytes is significantly higher than in adults, the cellular and humoral immunity is also impaired. Antigen-presenting cells in",

        "Like the reptiles, birds are primarily uricotelic, that is, their kidneys extract nitrogenous waste from their bloodstream and excrete it as uric acid instead of urea or ammonia through the ureters into the intestine. Birds do not have a urinary bladder or external urethral opening and (with exception of the ostrich) uric acid is excreted along with feces as a semisolid waste. However, birds such as hummingbirds can be facultatively ammonotelic, excreting most of the nitrogenous wastes as ammonia. They also excrete creatine, rather than creatinine like mammals. This material, as well as the output of the intestines, emerges from the bird's cloaca. The cloaca is a multi-purpose opening: waste is expelled through it, most birds mate by joining cloaca, and females lay eggs from it. In addition, many species of birds regurgitate pellets. Males within Palaeognathae (with the exception of the kiwis), the Anseriformes (with the exception of screamers), and in rudimentary forms in Galliformes (but fully developed in Cracidae) possess a penis, which is never present in Neoaves. The length is thought to be related to sperm competition. When not copulating, it is hidden within the proctodeum compartment within the cloaca, just inside the vent. The digestive system of birds is unique,",
        "Regarding the timing of German rapprochement, many historians agree that the dismissal of Maxim Litvinov, whose Jewish ethnicity was viewed unfavorably by Nazi Germany, removed an obstacle to negotiations with Germany. Stalin immediately directed Molotov to \"purge the ministry of Jews.\" Given Litvinov's prior attempts to create an anti-fascist coalition, association with the doctrine of collective security with France and Britain, and pro-Western orientation by the standards of the Kremlin, his dismissal indicated the existence of a Soviet option of rapprochement with Germany.[f] Likewise, Molotov's appointment served as a signal to Germany that the USSR was open to offers. The dismissal also signaled to France and Britain the existence of a potential negotiation option with Germany. One British official wrote that Litvinov's disappearance also meant the loss of an admirable technician or shock-absorber, while Molotov's \"modus operandi\" was \"more truly Bolshevik than diplomatic or cosmopolitan.\" Carr argued that the Soviet Union's replacement of Foreign Minister Litvinov with Molotov on May 3, 1939 indicated not an irrevocable shift towards alignment with Germany, but rather was Stalin's way",

Rumors held that she or Yuan Shikai ordered trusted eunuchs to poison the Guangxu Emperor, and an autopsy conducted nearly a century later confirmed lethal levels of arsenic in his corpse. Puyi, the oldest son of Zaifeng, Prince Chun, and nephew to the childless Guangxu Emperor, was appointed successor at the age of two, leaving Zaifeng with the regency. This was followed by the dismissal of General Yuan Shikai from his former positions of power. In April 1911 Zaifeng created a cabinet in which there were two vice-premiers. Nonetheless, this cabinet was also known by contemporaries as \"The Royal Cabinet\" because among the thirteen cabinet members, five were members of the imperial family or Aisin Gioro relatives. This brought a wide range of negative opinions from senior officials like Zhang Zhidong.

At the age of 14, he chose bodybuilding over soccer as a career. Schwarzenegger has responded to a question asking if he was 13 when he started weightlifting: \"I actually started weight training when I was 15, but I'd been participating in sports, like soccer, for years, so I felt that although I was slim, I was well-developed, at least enough so that I could start going to the gym and start Olympic lifting.\" However, his official website biography claims: \"At 14, he started an intensive training program with Dan Farmer, studied psychology at 15 (to learn more about the power of mind over body) and at 17, officially started his competitive career.\" During a speech in 2001, he said, \"My own plan formed when I was 14 years old. My father had wanted me to be a police officer like he was. My mother wanted me to go to trade school.\" Schwarzenegger took to visiting a gym in Graz, where he also frequented the local movie theaters to see bodybuilding idols such as Reg Park,",
        "During the 1930s, the first two motorways were built across the Land, the A4 motorway as an important east-west connection in central Germany and the main link between Berlin and south-west Germany, and the A9 motorway as the main north-south route in eastern Germany, connecting Berlin with Munich. The A4 runs from Frankfurt in Hesse via Eisenach, Gotha, Erfurt, Weimar, Jena and Gera to Dresden in Saxony, connecting Thuringia's most important cities. At Hermsdorf junction it is connected with the A9. Both highways were widened from four to six lanes (three each way) after 1990, including some extensive re-routing in the Eisenach and Jena areas. Furthermore, three new motorways were built during the 1990s and 2000s.

        "Public priests were appointed by the collegia. Once elected, a priest held permanent religious authority from the eternal divine, which offered him lifetime influence, privilege and immunity. Therefore, civil and religious law limited the number and kind of religious offices allowed an individual and his family. Religious law was collegial and traditional; it informed political decisions, could overturn them, and was difficult to exploit for personal gain. Priesthood was a costly honour: in traditional Roman practice, a priest drew no stipend. Cult donations were the property of the deity, whose priest must provide cult regardless of shortfalls in public funding \u2013 this could mean subsidy of acolytes and all other cult maintenance from personal funds. For those who had reached their goal in the Cursus honorum, permanent priesthood was best sought or granted after a lifetime's service in military or political life, or preferably both: it was a particularly honourable and active form of retirement which fulfilled an essential public duty. For a freedman or slave, promotion as one of the Compitalia seviri offered a high local profile, and opportunities in local politics; and therefore business. During the Imperial era, priesthood of the Imperial cult offered provincial elites full Roman citizenship and public prominence beyond their single year in religious office; in effect, it was the first step in a provincial cursus honorum. In Rome, the same Imperial cult role was performed by the Arval Brethren, once an obscure Republican priesthood dedicated to several deities, then co-opted by Augustus as part of his religious reforms. The Arvals offered prayer and sacrifice to",
        "When Nintendo released the NES in the US, the design styling was deliberately different from that of other game consoles. Nintendo wanted to distinguish its product from those of competitors and to avoid the generally poor reputation that game consoles had acquired following the video game crash of 1983. One result of this philosophy was to disguise the cartridge slot design as a front-loading zero insertion force (ZIF) cartridge socket, designed to resemble the front-loading mechanism of a VCR. The newly designed connector worked quite well when both the connector and the cartridges were clean and the pins on the connector were new. Unfortunately, the ZIF connector was not truly zero insertion force. When a user inserted the cartridge into the NES, the force of pressing the cartridge down and into place bent the contact pins slightly, as well as pressing the cartridge\u2019s ROM board back into the cartridge itself.

The myth of Danaus, whose origin is Egypt, is a foundation legend of Argos. His daughters Danaides, were forced in Tartarus to carry a jug to fill a bathtub without a bottom. This myth is connected with a task that can never be fulfilled (Sisyphos) and the name can be derived from the PIE root *danu: \"river\". There is not any satisfactory theory on their origin. Some scholars connect Danaans with the Denyen, one of the groups of the sea peoples who attacked Egypt during the reign of Ramesses III (1187-1156 BCE). The same inscription mentions the Weshesh who might have been the Achaeans. The Denyen seem to have been inhabitants of the city Adana in Cilicia. Pottery similar to that of Mycenae itself has been found in Tarsus of Cilicia and it seems that some refugees from the Aegean went there",
        "Anthropologists such as C. Loring Brace, the philosophers Jonathan Kaplan and Rasmus Winther, and the geneticist Joseph Graves,[page needed] have argued that while there it is certainly possible to find biological and genetic variation that corresponds roughly to the groupings normally defined as \"continental races\", this is true for almost all geographically distinct populations. The cluster structure of the genetic data is therefore dependent on the initial hypotheses of the researcher and the populations sampled. When one samples continental groups, the clusters become continental; if one had chosen other sampling patterns, the clustering would be different. Weiss and Fullerton have noted that if one sampled only Icelanders, Mayans and Maoris, three distinct clusters would form and all other populations could be described as being clinally composed of admixtures of Maori, Icelandic and Mayan genetic materials. Kaplan and Winther therefore argue that, seen in this way, both Lewontin and Edwards are right in their arguments. They conclude that while racial groups are characterized by different allele",
        "Unlike the Spanish milled dollar the U.S. dollar is based upon a decimal system of values.

It was proposed in the mid-1800s that one hundred dollars be known as a union, but no union coins were ever struck and only patterns for the $50 half union exist.

Francesca Martinez and Richard Vaughan refused to carry the torch, while Konnie Huq decided to carry it and also speak out against China. The pro-Tibetan Member of Parliament Norman Baker asked all bearers to reconsider. Amid pressure from both directions, Prime Minister Gordon Brown welcomed the torch outside 10 Downing Street without holding or touching it.

In the basic ladder match, the wrestlers or teams of wrestlers must climb a ladder to obtain a prize that is hoisted above the ring. The key to winning this match is that the wrestler or team of wrestlers must try to incapacitate each other long enough for one wrestler to climb the ladder and secure that prize for their team. As a result, the ladder can be used as a weapon. The prizes include \u2013 but are not limited to any given championship belt (the traditional prize), a document granting the winner the right to a future title shot, or any document that matters to the wrestlers involved in the match (such as one granting the winner a cash prize).

        "By March 2011, the market share of OS X in North America had increased to slightly over 14%. Whether the size of the Mac's market share and installed base is relevant, and to whom, is a hotly debated issue. Industry pundits have often called attention to the Mac's relatively small market share to predict Apple's impending doom, particularly in the early and mid-1990s when the company's future seemed bleakest. Others argue that market share is the wrong way to judge the Mac's success. Apple has positioned the Mac as a higher-end personal computer, and so it may be misleading to compare it to a budget PC. Because the overall market for personal computers has grown rapidly, the Mac's increasing sales numbers are effectively swamped by the industry's expanding sales volume as a whole. Apple's small market share, then, gives the impression that fewer people are using Macs than did ten years ago, when exactly the opposite is true. Soaring sales of the iPhone and iPad mean that the",

After the retirement of Sandberg and the trade of Dunston, the Cubs had holes to fill and the signing of Henry Rodr\u00edguez, known affectionately as \"H-Rod\" to bat cleanup provided protection for Sammy Sosa in the lineup, as Rodriguez slugged 31 round-trippers in his first season in Chicago. Kevin Tapani led the club with a career high 19 wins, Rod Beck anchored a strong bullpen and Mark Grace turned in one of his best seasons. The Cubs were swamped by media attention in 1998, and the team's two biggest headliners were Sosa and rookie flamethrower Kerry Wood. Wood's signature performance was one-hitting the Houston Astros, a game in which he tied the major league record of 20 strikeouts in nine innings. His torrid strikeout numbers earned Wood the nickname \"Kid K,\" and ultimately earned him the 1998 NL Rookie of the Year award.

Predators may hunt actively for prey in pursuit predation, or sit and wait for prey to approach within striking distance, as in ambush predators. Some predators kill large prey and dismember or chew it prior to eating it, such as a jaguar or a human; others may eat their (usually much smaller) prey whole, as does a bottlenose dolphin swallowing a fish, or a snake, duck or stork swallowing a frog. Some animals that kill both large and small prey for their size (domestic cats and dogs are prime examples) may do either depending upon the circumstances; either would devour a large insect whole but dismember a rabbit.

Al-Husayn sent his cousin Muslim bin Agail to verify if they would rally behind him. When the news reached Yazid I, he sent Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad, ruler of Basrah, with the instruction to prevent the people of Kufa rallying behind Al-Husayn. Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad managed to disperse the crowd that gathered around Muslim bin Agail and captured him. Realizing Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad had been instructed to prevent Husayn from establishing support in Kufa, Muslim bin Agail requested a message to be sent to Husayn to prevent his immigration to Kufa. The request was denied and Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad killed Muslim bin Agail.

Soon after, in the late 15th century, in the dynastic conflict between Isabella I of Castile and Joanna La Beltraneja, part of the Galician aristocracy supported Joanna. After Isabella's victory, she initiated an administrative and political reform which the chronicler Jeronimo Zurita defined as \"doma del Reino de Galicia\": 'It was then when the taming of Galicia began, because not just the local lords and knights, but all the people of that nation were the ones against the others very bold and warlike'. These reforms, while establishing a local government and tribunal (the Real Audiencia del Reino de Galicia) and bringing the nobleman under submission, also brought most Galician monasteries and institutions under Castilian control, in what has been criticized as a process of centralisation.

        "From his diagrams of a small number of particles interacting in spacetime, Feynman could then model all of physics in terms of the spins of those particles and the range of coupling of the fundamental forces. Feynman attempted an explanation of the strong interactions governing nucleons scattering called the parton model. The parton model emerged as a complement to the quark model developed by his Caltech colleague Murray Gell-Mann. The relationship between the two models was murky; Gell-Mann referred to Feynman's partons derisively as \"put-ons\". In the mid-1960s, physicists believed that quarks were just a bookkeeping device for symmetry numbers, not real particles, as the statistics of the Omega-minus particle, if it were interpreted as three identical strange quarks bound together, seemed impossible if quarks were real. The Stanford linear accelerator deep inelastic scattering experiments of the late 1960s showed, analogously to Ernest Rutherford's experiment of scattering alpha particles on gold nuclei in 1911, that nucleons (protons and neutrons) contained point-like particles that scattered electrons. It was natural to identify these with quarks, but Feynman's parton model attempted to interpret the experimental data in a way that did not introduce additional hypotheses. For example, the data showed that",

John attempted a synchronised operation involving land-based and water-borne forces, considered by most historians today to have been imaginative in conception, but overly complex for forces of the period to have carried out successfully. John's relief operation was blocked by Philip's forces, and John turned back to Brittany in an attempt to draw Philip away from eastern Normandy. John successfully devastated much of Brittany, but did not deflect Philip's main thrust into the east of Normandy. Opinions vary amongst historians as to the military skill shown by John during this campaign, with most recent historians arguing that his performance was passable, although not impressive.[nb 8] John's situation began to deteriorate rapidly. The eastern border region of Normandy had been extensively cultivated by Philip and his predecessors for several years, whilst Angevin authority in the south had been undermined by Richard's giving away of various key castles some years before. His use of routier mercenaries in the central regions had rapidly eaten away his remaining support in this area too, which set the stage for a sudden collapse of Angevin power.[nb 9] John retreated back across the Channel in December, sending orders for the establishment of a fresh defensive line to the west of Chateau Gaillard.

Richards of the University of Huddersfield in England reached different conclusions, again corroborating the pre-2006 origin hypothesis. Testing was performed on the full 16,600 DNA units composing mitochondrial DNA (the 2006 Behar study had only tested 1,000 units) in all their subjects, and the study found that the four main female Ashkenazi founders had descent lines that were established in Europe 10,000 to 20,000 years in the past while most of the remaining minor founders also have a deep European ancestry. The study states that the great majority of Ashkenazi maternal lineages were not brought from the Near East (i.e., they were non-Israelite), nor were they recruited in the Caucasus (i.e., they were non-Khazar), but instead they were assimilated within Europe, primarily of Italian and Old French origins.

A \"Draft Eisenhower\" movement in the Republican Party persuaded him to declare his candidacy in the 1952 presidential election to counter the candidacy of non-interventionist Senator Robert A.

Early in 2010 the New Jersey state legislature passed a bill offering tax incentives to attract new investors and complete the job, but a poll by Fairleigh Dickinson University's PublicMind released in March 2010 showed that three of five voters (60%) opposed the legislation, and two of three of those who opposed it \"strongly\" opposed it. Ultimately, Governor Chris Christie offered Revel $261 million in state tax credits to assist the casino once it opened. As of March 2011[update], Revel had completed all of the exterior work and had continued work on the interior after finally receiving the funding necessary to complete construction. It had a soft opening in",
        "The final major aspect of identity formation is self-esteem. Self-esteem is defined as one's thoughts and feelings about one's self-concept and identity. Most theories on self-esteem state that there is a grand desire, across all genders and ages, to maintain, protect and enhance their self-esteem. Contrary to popular belief, there is no empirical evidence for a significant drop in self-esteem over the course of adolescence. \"Barometric self-esteem\" fluctuates rapidly and can cause severe distress and anxiety, but baseline self-esteem remains highly stable across adolescence. The validity of global self-esteem scales has been questioned, and many suggest that more specific scales might reveal more about the adolescent experience. Girls are most likely to enjoy high self-esteem when engaged in supportive relationships with friends, the most important function of friendship to them is having someone who can provide social and moral support. When they fail to win friends' approval or couldn't find someone with whom to share common activities and common interests, in these",

The Deluxe Set, retailing at US$199.99 (equivalent to $475 in 2016), included R.O.B., a light gun called the NES Zapper, two controllers, and two Game Paks: Gyromite, and Duck Hunt. The Basic Set, retailing at US$89.99 with no game, and US$99.99 bundled with \"Super Mario Bros.\" The Action Set, retailing in 1988 for US$149.99, came with the Control Deck, two game controllers, an NES Zapper, and a dual Game Pak containing both Super Mario Bros. and Duck Hunt. In 1989, the Power Set included the console, two game controllers, a NES Zapper, a Power Pad, and a triple Game Pak containing Super Mario Bros, Duck Hunt, and World Class Track Meet. In 1990, a Sports Set bundle was released, including the console, an NES Satellite infrared wireless multitap adapter, four game controllers, and a dual Game Pak containing Super Spike V'Ball and Nintendo World Cup. Two more bundle packages were later released using the original model NES console.

        "A period of division for the Liberals followed, with former Treasurer John Howard competing with former Foreign Minister Andrew Peacock for supremacy. The Australian economy was facing the early 1990s recession. Unemployment reached 11.4% in 1992. Under Dr John Hewson, in November 1991, the opposition launched the 650-page Fightback! policy document \u2212 a radical collection of \"dry\", economic liberal measures including the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST), various changes to Medicare including the abolition of bulk billing for non-concession holders, the introduction of a nine-month limit on unemployment benefits, various changes to industrial relations including the abolition of awards, a $13 billion personal income tax cut directed at middle and upper income earners, $10 billion in government spending cuts, the abolition of state payroll taxes and the privatisation of a large number of government owned enterprises \u2212 representing the start of a very different future direction to the keynesian economic conservatism practiced by previous Liberal/National Coalition governments. The 15 percent GST was the centerpiece of the policy document. Through 1992, Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating mounted a campaign against the Fightback package, and particularly against the GST, which he described as an attack on the working class in that it shifted the tax burden from direct taxation of the wealthy to",

He sent him, indeed, five hundred pieces of gold \"to bear his charges\" but Liberius refused them, saying, he might bestow them on his flatters; as he did also a like present from the empress, bidding the messenger learn to believe in Christ, and not to persecute the Church of God. Attempts were made to leave the presents in The Church, but Liberius threw them out. Constantius hereupon sent for him under a strict guard to Milan, where, in a conference recorded by Theodoret, he boldly told Constantius that Athanasius had been acquitted at Sardica, and his enemies proved calumniators (see: \"calumny\") and impostors, and that it was unjust to condemn a person who could not be legally convicted of any crime.

        "The Montana Territory was formed on April 26, 1864, when the U.S. passed the Organic Act. Schools started forming in the area before it was officially a territory as families started settling into the area. The first schools were subscription schools that typically held in the teacher's home. The first formal school on record was at Fort Owen in Bitterroot valley in 1862. The students were Indian children and the children of Fort Owen employees. The first school term started in early winter and only lasted until February 28. Classes were taught by Mr. Robinson. Another early subscription school was started by Thomas Dimsdale in Virginia City in 1863. In this school students were charged $1.75 per week. The Montana Territorial Legislative Assembly had its inaugural meeting in 1864. The first legislature authorized counties to levy taxes for schools, which set the foundations for public schooling. Madison County was the first to take advantage of the newly authorized taxes and it formed fhe first public school in Virginia City in 1886. The first school year",

A tragic blow fell upon Burke with the loss of Richard in August 1794, to whom he was tenderly attached, and in whom he saw signs of promise, which were not patent to others and which, in fact, appear to have been non-existent (though this view may have rather reflected the fact that Richard Burke had worked successfully in the early battle for Catholic emancipation). King George III, whose favour he had gained by his attitude on the French Revolution, wished to create him Earl of Beaconsfield, but the death of his son deprived the opportunity of such an honour and all its attractions, so the only award he would accept was a pension of \u00a32,500. Even this modest reward was attacked by the Duke of Bedford and the Earl of Lauderdale, to whom Burke replied in his Letter to a Noble Lord (1796): \"It cannot at this time be too often repeated; line upon line; precept upon precept; until it comes into the",
        "The nation almost immediately fell into civil war that involved various factions fighting one another; these factions were often distinguished by clan loyalties. More than 500,000 residents fled during this time because of persecution, increased poverty and better economic opportunities in the West or in other former Soviet republics. Emomali Rahmon came to power in 1992, defeating former prime minister Abdumalik Abdullajanov in a November presidential election with 58% of the vote. The elections took place shortly after the end of the war, and Tajikistan was in a state of complete devastation. The estimated dead numbered over 100,000. Around 1.2 million people were refugees inside and outside of the country. In 1997, a ceasefire was reached between Rahmon and opposition parties under the guidance of Gerd D.

Figo had become a cult hero, and was considered by Catalans to be one of their own. However, Barcelona fans were distraught by Figo's decision to join arch-rivals Real Madrid, and, during subsequent visits to the Camp Nou, Figo was given an extremely hostile reception. Upon his first return, a piglet's head and a full bottle of whiskey were thrown at him from the crowd. The next three years saw the club in decline, and managers came and went. van Gaal was replaced by Lloren\u00e7 Serra Ferrer who, despite an extensive investment in players in the summer of 2000, presided over a mediocre league campaign and a humiliating first-round Champions League exit, and was eventually dismissed late in the season.

        "In 1954, prominent Serbian and Croatian writers, linguists and literary critics, supported by Matica srpska and Matica hrvatska signed the Agreement of Novi Sad. His first conclusion boldly declared that \"Serbs, Croats and Montenegrins share a single language with two equal variants that have developed around Zagreb (western) and Belgrade (east)\". The agreement praised the equal status of the Cyrillic and Latin scripts as well as the Ekavian and Ijekavian pronunciations. It specified that Serbo-Croatian should be the official language name, while traditional Serbo and Croatian could be used informally. Matica hrvatska and Matica srpska committed to collaborate on a dictionary, and a joint committee from Serbian and Croatian linguists was tasked with preparing a pravopis. Both publications simultaneously emerged during the 1960s \u2014 Ijekavian Latin in Zagreb and Ekavian Cyrillic in Novi Sad. Despite this cooperative effort, Croatian linguists viewed it as an act of unitarianism. However, their evidence remained inconclusive : the complaints of Belgrade television using the Latin alphabet reflected usage patterns rather than systemic inequality. His criticism of the Novi Sad Dictionary's side-by-side word listings could also be interpreted as a meticulous respect for linguistic diversity. Croatian linguists even criticised dictionary sections written by their own compatriots and overlooked the contribution of the Croatian Philological Society to Pravopisni rjenik. This tension ultimately culminated in 1967 in the declaration of Croatian intellectuals on the status and name of the Croatian literary language, which was published with critical analysis in 2012 by the Croatian weekly Forum to mark its 45th anniversary.",
        "The Bush administration shifted its focus to Iraq, arguing the urgent need to remove Saddam Hussein from power. The primary justification centered on allegations that Hussein's regime had tried to get nuclear material and failed to account for known biological and chemical weapons, potentially violating UN sanctions. Despite the administration\u2019s incessant claims about arms of mass destruction (WMD), major powers like China, France, Germany and Russia remained skeptical about the Iraqi threat. UN - Weapons - Inspectors entered Iraq in November 2002 and were investigating the claims of WMD when the Bush administration decided to proceed with the war without UN authorization, ordering the inspectors to leave. On 20 March 2003, the United States launched an invasion with a \"coalition of the willing\" including troops from the United Kingdom, Australia and Poland. Within three weeks, the invasion toppled the Iraqi government and military, yet no WMD were discovered. While traces of former weapons laboratories were reported, no conclusive evidence emerged. On May 1, President Bush declared the end of his \"major combat operations\" during a speech on the USS Abraham Lincoln, his approval rating reaching 66%. However, public support quickly eroded as the reconstruction efforts stalled, the casualties mounted and the absence of WMD raised serious questions about the war\u2019s fundamental basis.",
        "An adolescent's environment significantly influences their identity development. While most adolescent studies focus on white, middle-class children, research indicates that privileged upbringings correlate with more successful identity formation. The transition to adulthood now spans a longer period than in the mid-20th century with youth emerging as a more prominent stage of life. Numerous factors contribute to the social identity of an adolescent including commitment, coping mechanisms and social media, all of which are shaped by their environment. Adolescents from privileged backgrounds typically have access to more opportunities and supportive situations, while those from disadvantaged or high-crime neighborhoods may face developmental challenges. Adolescence represents a critical period of personal growth, and environmental exposure can profoundly impact future decision-making. Individuals from stable, suburban communities are more likely to engage in activities that foster positive identity development and personal growth.",
        "In the world of professional sports, preseason of the National Football League is a carefully orchestrated ritual, distinct from other team sport preparations. Each NFL franchise navigates a precise choreography of four exhibition games annually\u2014two within the hallowed confines of their home stadium and two on distant fields\u2014with a select pair of teams granted the ceremonial fifth game at the Pro Football Hall of Fame. These August encounters serve as crucibles where coaches distill their expansive offseason roster of ninety athletes to the lean, battle-ready list of fifty-three. Although less rigidly structured than regular-season schedules, these preseason competitions are nevertheless bound by an intricate web of restrictions and time-honoured traditions. The League's global ambitions have propelled these exhibitions across continents\u2014Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia and Mexico\u2014while remaining steadfast to a purist approach that excludes non-league opponents and prohibits split-squad performances. Despite their technical significance, these games remain a source of fan frustration, with fans resenting the admission at full-price in what are basically competitive test-runs. The Pro Bowl, a final ceremonial game traditionally ending or preceding the Super Bowl, further punctuates this preparatory tableau and symbolizes the complex preseason ecosystem of the league.",
        "In practice, not all Rule violations result in disqualification, as the referee can exercise discretion and is not obliged to halt the game. Typically, only egregious offenses like low blows, weapon use, interference or assault the referee will lead to immediate disqualification. In WWE a referee must personally witness the violation to end the match, with video evidence rarely sufficating and the ruling is virtually absolute, though occasional Dusty finishes (named after the legendary Dusty Rhodes) can overturn the initial decision. Referee knockouts are a common spectacle, often strategically orchestrated to create dramatic opportunities. When a referee is \"unconscious,\" wrestlers exploit the moment to bend rules or break them until the official is revived or replaced. Some referees may even disqualify a wrestler presumed responsible for their incapacitation, particularly when a heel wrestler deliberately manipulates the situation. A classic scenario might involve a wrestler being strategically whipped into the referee at a calculated speed and causing a brief incapacitation. During this window, a wrestler might attempt a pin attempt that would have secured the victory if it was not for the prone state of the referee. Occasionally, a back-in referee might sprint from backstage to make the count, but typically the opponent has recovered enough to kick out.",
        "In the 15th century, the cathedral rose his majestic dome, extending the naves behind the choir and seamlessly connecting the building to its towering spire, creating a grand entrance. In 1674, Archbishop Luis Alfonso de los Cameros initiated the construction of the main chapel and adorned its walls with intricate marbles and bronzes that illustrate the lavish Baroque style of the era. In the dawn of the 18th century, the German architect Conrad Rudolphus designed the imposing facade while two additional doors flanked the transept \u2014 one, the Apostles' Portal, with pure Gothic pointed arches dating from the 14th century, and the other bearing the name Pal\u00e1u. Despite later modifications that somewhat reduced the original height of the cathedral, the restoration of the 18th century softened the pointed arches, replaced Gothic columns with elegant Corinthian pillars, and reconstructed the interior walls. The inaccessible dome lacks a lantern, its plain ceiling pierced by two expansive side windows. Four chapels mingle the central space, complemented by additional sanctuaries in the choir, the transept and the sanctuary on each side. The interior houses remarkable paintings by renowned artists, including two masterpieces by Francisco Goya in the chapel of San Francesco. During the 1808 war, a silver reredo was once positioned behind the altar and used to fund military campaigns. Adjacent to the Cathedral is the chapel dedicated to the Forsaken Lady, a testament to the building's rich spiritual heritage.",

Other critics highlighted the genuine talent revealed by the series. The show was described as a \"disgusting musical bake-off\" and a 'romp in humiliation', respectively. Critics also audit the commercial aspects of the program, with Karla Peterson of the San Diego Union-Tribune characterizing it as 'a conniving multimedia monster' that has \"the sin of our debauched culture and spit them out in a lump of reconstituted evil\" The decision to have the season one winner perform the national anthem at the Lincoln Memorial on the 11th anniversary in 2002 was particularly controversial. Lisa de Moraes of the Washington Post said sardonically that \"The terrorists have won\", critiquing both the commercialist approach of the show and voting process, noting that the selection of who would \"turn this important site into just another piece in the 'Great American Idol Marketing Mandala'\" was determined by millions of viewers and phone-redialing enthusiasts allegedly voting for their preferred contestants multiple times.",

As Donald Trelford of The Observer noted, the ''royal soap opera '' had reached such a fever pitch that truth appeared almost irrelevant. Rumors swirled about the tensions between the Queen and Margaret Thatcher, with reports indicating the monarch was deeply concerned about the high unemployment, the social divisions and Thatcher's position on apartheid. While the royal aide Michael Shea claimed his remarks were taken out of context, speculation ran wild, including a rumor that Thatcher believed that the queen would support her political opponents. Despite these tensions, the relationship between the two women was more nuanced. The Queen then expressed personal admiration for the Queen, who reciprocated by honoring her with prestigious awards.

        "To extend and consolidate the control of the dynasty in Central Asia, the Kangxi emperor personally led military campaigns against the Dzungars in the outside Mongolia. He successfully expelled Galdan's invading forces from these regions, which were then incorporated into the empire. Galdan was eventually killed in the Dzungar \u2013 Qing War. In 1683, the Qing troops received the surrender of Zheng Keshuang, the grandson of Koxinga, who had previously conquered the island from Dutch colonists. After moving to Beijing, Zheng was awarded the title of \"Duke Haicheng\" and inducted in the Han Chinese Plain Red Banner of the Eight Banners. Several Ming princes who had accompanied Koxinga to Taiwan in 1661-1662, including Prince of Ningjing Zhu Shugui and Prince Zhu Honghuan, lived in the kingdom of Tungning. In 1683, Qing sent the 17 surviving Ming princes back to mainland China, where they lived in exile. Winning Taiwan freed Kangxi's forces for the battles over Albazin, Russia's far eastern outpost. Zheng's former soldiers, including the rattan shield troops, were inducted into the eight banners and used against Russian cossacks at Albazin. The Treaty of Nerchinsk of 1689, China's first formal agreement with a European power, maintained the border peace for almost two centuries. After Galdan's death, his followers, adherents to Tibetan Buddhism, attempted to control the next Dalai Lama's selection.

Researchers in cultural studies explore how everyday practices\u2014from watching television to eating out\u2014reflect deeper social dynamics related to ideology, nationality, ethnicity and gender identity. The field is especially interested in the unspoken meanings and behaviors that shape human experience, focusing on how people navigate cultural norms and construct identity. As globalization spreads capitalist systems worldwide, cultural studies have increasingly examined how local communities resist Western cultural dominance, revealing the complex ways cultures interact, negotiate and transform each other. In unpacking these complex cultural interactions, the discipline offers profound insights into the human social experience and the power dynamics that underlie our shared lives.",

        "Mammalian hair, or pelage, exhibits color variation across populations, individual organisms and even within a single animal. Light-dark color variations are common in mammalian taxa, influenced by factors such as age and selective pressures from environmental interactions and environmental conditions. These pressures drive color adaptations that improve survival, with camouflage being the most prominent mechanism for concealment from predators or prey. Beyond camouflage, the coat color serves multiple evolutionary functions including intraspecies communication, sexual selection and physiological adaptation. Color variations can indicate critical information like health status, reproductive fitness, and the recognition of maternal offspring, while also indicating nutritional and hormonal profiles. Physiological responses, such as temperature regulation in extreme environments, further contribute to color diversity Despite extensive observations, the genetic mechanisms that form the coat color remain partially mysterious. Researchers have identified that pigmentation genes affect phenotype by modulating hair pigmentation distribution and hair density. Quantitative trait mapping is currently advancing our understanding of the genetic loci responsible for color variation, although many aspects of gene expression remain to be discovered.",
        "In the mid--18th century, during the French Enlightenment, the term \"humanism\" emerged with a more profound ideological significance. In 1765, an anonymous author described in a French periodical as \"the general love of humanity,\" a virtue previously unnamed, suggesting the need for a word to capture such a beautiful and necessary concept. The late 18th and early 19th centuries witnessed the proliferation of philanthropic societies dedicated to human advancement and knowledge dissemination, reflecting a growing belief in human potential. Upon the French Revolution, the notion that human virtue could be cultivated only by reason\u2014a principle that was given up to Enlightenment philosophers like Rousseau \u2014 met vehement criticism from religious and political conservatives such as Edmund Burke and Joseph de Maistre, who viewed it as a dangerous deification of humanity. As tensions mounted, \"humanism\" began to get a more complex and often negative connotation. The Oxford English Dictionary notes its use in 1812 by an English clergyman to describe those believing in Christ's \"mere humanity\" and distinguishing the Unitarians and the Deists. In this polarized climate where ecclesiastical institutions rejected social reforms like universal suffrage and education, liberal reformers accepted humanism as an alternative spiritual framework. Prominent thinkers like Proudhon, who famously declared \"property is theft\" and Ernest Renan imagined humanism as a transformative force -- a potential \"religion of the future\" that would elevate human experience to a sacred moral plane.",
        "In cases involving three or more parties, no single party is likely to gain power independently, leading to the formation of coalition governments. This trend has emerged in the Republic of Ireland since the 1980s and is nearly universal in Germany at the national, state and local levels. Similarly, the Republic of Iceland has never had a government not led by a coalition, typically the Independence Party and another party like the Social Democratic Alliance. In Ireland, since 1989, no party has been governed alone, with coalitions led by Fianna F\u00e1il or Fine Gael exclusively. While coalition governments can facilitate political change more easily than dominant party system systems, they also can struggle to implement policy changes. Two-party systems with fundamental disagreements, such as the current political landscape of the U.S. can become gridlocked. Conversely, when one party controls all elective branches, policy changes can be rapid and substantial as demonstrated by presidents like Ronald Reagan, Franklin Roosevelt, Lyndon Johnson, Abraham Lincoln and Barack Obama.",
        "Emotions are fundamental to human social interactions and relationships, deeply rooted in the basic physiology and stress systems. The oxytocin-attachment system plays a crucial role in bonding with the emotional phenotype temperaments positively influencing social connectedness and fitness in complex social systems. These characteristics are shared between species and taxa by genetic transmission. Generic information encoded in DNA sequences provides the blueprint for protein assembly within cells, with zygotes inheriting genetic material from parents' germ cells. During genital characterization, heritable traits that enabled ancestral survival and reproduction are passed along, together with potentially beneficial new traits. In the five million years since the divergence of human and chimpanzee lineages, only about 1.2% of their genetic material has been modified, suggesting that the distinguishing characteristics between these species are encoded in this small genetic variation. Animal behavior studies have identified intraspecific examples of gene-dependent behavioral phenotypes such as small genetic differences in the vasopressin receptor gene of voles that correspond to significant variations in social organization and mating systems Similarly, the FOCP2 gene, involved in the neural circuitry related to speech and language, differs from chimpanzee variants by only a few mutations and has been present for about 200,000 years, when it coincides with the emergence of modern humans. Intriguingly connected are speech, language and social organisation with emotional processes, highlighting the complex interplay between genetics and behavior.",
        "The implications of identity are deep across various research traditions examining social phenomena. One significant manifestation occurs in occupational settings, particularly in stigmatized jobs or in the 'dirty work' (Hughes, 1951 ). Individuals gravitate toward or abate from particular jobs based on their potential to validate a \"preferred organizational self\" (Tracy & Trethewey, 2005, p. 169 ). Some occupations carry inherent stigmas or acclaims such as correctional officers who are struggling to overcome perceptions of being \"glorified maids\". The process of justifying and valuing occupational choices directly impacts work place satisfaction and overall quality of life (Tracy & Scott, 2006). Workers in stigmatized roles must strategically craft a positive self-identity and navigate societal discourses that challenge their professional worth. When traditional identity management proves difficult, employees may resort to alternative strategies such as client-blaming to affirm their professional standing and maintain a sense of personal dignity.",
        "Jeffrey Long and Rick Kittles critique the application of FST to human populations in their 2003 paper, challenging the widely cited statistic of 85% genetic diversity. They argue that this figure confuses human population history by treating all groups as independent entities. Instead, they propose a more nuanced model where human groups are interconnected, with some populations serving as ancestral to others. Based on African origin theory, they demonstrate how non-African populations derive from a limited, non-representative sample of the African population, creating a genetic bottleneck. This migration pattern results in a gradual dilution of genetic diversity as populations move farther away from Africa, with each founding event representing a genetic subset of the parent population. Their research reveals that while a single African population contains approximately 100% of the human genetic diversity, a New Guinea-derived population retains about 70%. Long and Kittles conclude despite these variations that humans remain genetically homogeneous compared to other mammalian species.",
        "Darwin's groundbreaking work traversed linguistic landscapes, weaving through cultural interpretations that both illuminated and sometimes distorted his revolutionary ideas. The international book's journey was fraught with complex translation challenges, where scholars and naturalists grappled with rendering his nuanced concepts. The German translation by Heinrich Georg Bronn, although initially welcomed, subtly reshaped Darwin's original narrative, injecting philosophical undertones and reframing key terminology that shifted the work's fundamental message. Cl\u00e9mence Royer's French translation added another layer of intellectual complexity, transforming the text into a provocative philosophical statement that expanded beyond scientific discourse. Despite Darwin's meticulous correspondence and careful guidance, each translation became a delicate negotiation between scientific precision and cultural interpretation. The remarkable linguistic evolution of the book reflected not just a scientific treatise but a global intellectual conversation that transcended national boundaries and gradually permeated diverse academic and philosophical circles. By the time of Darwin's death his seminal work had been embraced by scholars across continents to speak to the universal resonance of his groundbreaking theory of evolution.",
        "Hegel aims to preserve the core principles of German idealism, particularly Kant's belief that ethical reason transcends finite inclinations. A fundamental identity between thought and being is necessary for any human observer (subject) to comprehend an external entity (object). Under his concept of \"subject-object identity,\" both subject and object share Spirit\u2014Hegel's reimagined, non-supernatural equivalent of \"God\"\u2014as their conceptual inner reality. Until Spirit attains self-realization and develops to Absolute Spirit, the human mind mistakenly perceives observed objects as inherently alien and separate. As Hegel articulates, \"The object is revealed to it [to the  subject''] by [as] something alien and it does not recognize itself.\" Self-realization comes when Hegel, embodying Spirit's collective human consciousness, recognizes that every object is essentially himself, as both subject and object are manifestations of Spirit. When Spirit becomes Absolute Spirit, the finite (human) merges with the infinite (divine) upon this transformation, supplanting the supernatural theistic conception of God. The Hegelianism, as Tucker insinuates succinctly, is \"a religion of self-testimony\" in which humanity accompanies and ultimately successfully aspires to divine status.",
        "In the annals of ancient history the Israelites savored moments of political sovereignty, first during the Epoch of Biblical Judges and subsequently under the United Monarchy. Following the fragmentation of the kingdom, the land was divided into Israel and Judah. The Roman name \"Judean\" \"Jew\" emerged from the Roman \"Judean\" denoted inhabitants of the southern kingdom. The linguistic metamorphosis, though absent from the Torah, was crystallized in the book of Esther in the 4th century BCE. In 587 BC Nebuchadnezzar II besieged Jerusalem and razed the first Temple and exiled the most prestigious citizens of Judah. By 586 BC, Judah's independence crumbled leaving its people stateless. The Babylonian exile culminated in 539 BCE when the Achaemenid Empire conquered Babylon and Cyrus the Great permitted the exiled Jews to return and rebuild their temples. The second temple rose in 515 BCE, and Yehud province remained tranquil until Alexander the Great's conquest around 333 BCE. While during the Hasmonean dynasty (140-37 BCE) and partially under Herodine rule (37 BCE-6 CE) Jewish political autonomy was briefly resuspended. Since the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, Jews have predominantly inhabited the diaspora, enduring constant persecution as an ethnic minority in almost every land, resulting in a population marked by constant flux and resilience.",
        "At the Tokyo Game Show in September 2012, Sony unveiled its revolutionary PS3 Super Slim redesign (CECH-4000 ), which marks a significant milestone in gaming hardware evolution. The sleek new console came in three distinct configurations : a robust 500 GB version, a 250 GB variant limited to specific regions and an innovative 12 GB flash storage version exclusively available in PAL territories. Notably, the 12 GB model offered expandability through an official 250 GB hard drive upgrade. The design was complemented by a vertical stand to increase the versatility of the console. The launch unfolded across global markets with the UK first seeing the 500 GB model on September 28, 2012, followed by the 12 GB version on October 12, 2012. In the United States, Sony strategically released bundled consoles, pairing the 250 GB model with Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception and the 500 GB variant with Assassin's Creed III. The release of Super Slim - models in black and white was on October 4 and November 22, 2012, respectively. This new iteration was remarkablely 20 percent smaller and 25 percent lighter than its predecessor and featured a manual sliding disc cover that replaced the previous motorized mechanism. The console's color palette expanded with Garnet Red and Azurite Blue models, each tied to specific game bundles and regional releases, further cementing the PS3 Super Slim status as a landmark gaming platform.",
        "In 1919, following the Versailles Treaty, Strasbourg was retroactive to France on the Fourteen Points by US President Woodrow Wilson without a referendum. The date of the transfer was retroactively established on Armistice Day. A local plebiscite would have likely challenged France's claim, as political parties, which advocated for Alsatian autonomy or French connection, represent a marginal electoral presence. The Alsatian autonomists sympathetic to France had gained substantial support in rural areas since the German annexation of 1871, a movement which drew its start with the first Reichstag election. These elected representatives, known as the \"Les D\u00e9put\u00e9s Protestataires\", demanded a permanent return to France until Bismarck's fall in 1890. The final Chancellorstag election in Strasbourg and its periphery saw Social Democrats victors, reflecting the city's status as a regional administrative centre populated by government appointed Germans and characterized by a flourishing economy. This demographic composition potentially explains the voting disparities between urban and rural constituencies. Many Germans left Strasbourg post-war with some denounced by locals or forced to flee by new authorities, while the memory of the Saverne - Afffair remained deep in Alsatian collective consciousness.",
        "The manufacturing landscape of Zhejiang is characterized by electromechanical industries, textiles, chemicals, food production and construction materials. The province pioneered its distinctive \"Zhejiang model,\" which emphasizes entrepreneurship, agile small businesses, substantial infrastructure investments and cost-effective bulk production for domestic and international markets. This approach has transformed Zhejiang into one of China's most prosperous provinces, with the \"Zhejiang spirit\" becoming legendary. Also, economists caution now that the model may not be sustainable, citing inefficiencies, excessive resource use and limitations in technological progress. The economic center is gradually shifting from the North Zhejiang, centered on Hangzhou, to the southeastern region around Wenzhou and Taizhou. In 2009, the consumption of urban residents per capita reached 24,611 Yuan, with an 8.3% real growth rate, while the per capita income of rural residents was 10,007 Yuan, which increased 8.1% annualally. By 2011 the nominal GDP of Zhejiang had grown to 3.20 trillion yuan, with a GDP per capita of 44,335 yuan In 2009, the provinces' industries were valued at 116.2 billion yuan (primary), 1.1843 trillion yuan (secondary) and 982.7 billion yuan (tertiary).",
        "During the emerging years of home video, MCA embarked on a pioneering journey of disc manufacturing, weaving intricate partnerships with cinematic giants such as Paramount, Disney, and Warner Bros. As the landscape of home entertainment shifted, some studios adorned disc jackets with their own art work, signalling ownership nuances. When Discovision Associates dissolved in early 1982, Universal Studio's videodisc division breathed new life into DiscoVision titles, though not without sacrificing artistic integrity. Beloved classics like Battlestar Galactica and Jaws suffered the indignity of time compression, their original essence diluted and transformed. The LaserDisc version of Jaws became a haunting shadow of its former self stripped of its original soundtrack, with the accidental music replaced due to the cold calculation of licensing costs. The Electric Horseman, a Universal/Columbia co-production, remained trapped in a liminal space, his original musical score being forever lost across subsequent home video iterations.

        "Agrarian societies emerged in southeast Europe in the 7th century BC, exemplified by one of Europe's earliest farming villages in Vashtmi, southeastern Albania, dating back 6,500 BC. Anthropomorphic figurines were found from 6000 BC in the Balkans and in Central Europe from circa 5800 BC. Among the region's earliest cultural complexes is the Sesklo culture in Thessaly which has expanded throughout the Balkans and gave birth to the Starevo-K\u00f6r\u00f6s (Cris), Linearbandkeramik and Vina cultures. Through cultural diffusion and population migration, Neolithic traditions spread westward and north to North-West Europe around 4500 BC. The Vina culture potentially developed the earliest writing system, the Vina signs, though archaeologists suggest that these were likely pictograms and ideograms. From 5300 to 2300 BC, the Cucuteni-Trypillian culture built substantial settlements in Romania, Moldova and Ukraine. The megalithic temple complexes of the gantija on Gozo and Mnajdra in Malta are renowned for their gigantic Neolithic structures, the oldest of them dating back to circa 3600 BC. The Hypogeum of al-Saflieni in Paola, Malta is a unique subterranean sanctuary-turned-necropolis excavated in around 2500 BC, representing the world's only prehistoric underground temple and showcasing unparalleled stone sculptures. After 2500 BC the Maltese Islands experienced depopulation until the Bronze Age arrived immigrants introducing a culture that cremated its dead and established smaller megalithic dolmens. These structures, usually with small chambers covered by large stone slabs, are believed to have been introduced by settlers from Sicily, as is evidenced by similarities in architectural design.",
        "For Popper, knowledge was inherently objective, including both its truthlike nature and its ontological status independent of the subject. He proposed a tripartite model : World One representing the physical realm, World Two representing the domain of mental states and perceptions and World Three the cumulative body of human knowledge, expressed through various artifacts. Popper argued that World Three emerges from individual human contributions, analogous to an animal path whose creation is formed by collective traversal and has an autonomous existence and evolutionary trajectory. He claimed that World Three exerts a profound influence on individual consciousness, implying that personal knowledge is as much a product of accumulated human understanding as direct experiential input. Consequently, the advancement of human knowledge can be understood as a function of World Three's independent evolution. Although innovative, this conceptual framework has been met with skepticism by contemporary philosophers like Daniel Dennett, who view it as reminiscent of traditional mind-body dualism.",
        "In The United Kingdom, who's political structure guided the government created by the U.S. Constitution, strict separation of powers did not exist. Under the Westminster System, based on parliamentary sovereignty and responsible government, the House of Lords, House of Lords, and Parliament were the supreme lawmaker. As the executive branch acted in the name of King, as did the judiciary. The King\u2019s Ministers were typically members of one of the two houses of Parliament and the government needed the support of a majority in the House of Commons. One minister, the Lord Chancellor, served as the sole judge in the Court of Chancery and the presiding officer in the House of Lords simultaneously. Therefore, the three branches of the British government frequently violated the principle of separation of powers, despite occasional disagreements between the government branches. In the 18th century, some US states also did not observe a strict separation of powers. In New Jersey, the governor served as the governor of the state court and the presiding officer of one legislative house. The president of Delaware served on the Court of Appeals while legislative presiding officers held executive department roles as vice-chairs. Both in Delaware and in Pennsylvania, executive council members served as judges simultaneously. Many southern states explicitly required separation of powers, with Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina and Georgia retaining distinct governmental branches.",
        "Ottoman madaris encompassed various branches of study, including calligraphy, oral and intellectual sciences, primarily functioning as Islamic centres for spiritual learning. As nalck notes, the fundamental aim of knowledge, especially the spiritual sciences, was to understand God with religion determined the significance of each discipline. While mathematics and logic were a part of the curriculum, they were intrinsically related to religious objectives. The Ulema believed that these subjects refined thought and ultimately revealed divine truths. Even philosophy was allowed only to confirm Islamic doctrines. Despite scholarly arguments about Ottoman societal tolerance, these educational institutions were fundamentally religious, focusing exclusively on Islamic teachings. Comparative evidence from European contexts such as Jewish and Protestant educational practices reveals similar approaches to education during the early modern period where religious values and teachings were paramount. Ultimately, Ottoman madaris provided a comprehensive educational framework that while diverse in its subjects remained keenly focused on reinforcing and perpetuating Islamic intellectual and spiritual traditions.",

        "In the shadowed realm of the 14th century, the French monarchs crafted a tapestry of ambitions, their tendrils reaching hungrily into the noble lands, sparking a conflict that would go on for centuries. The Hundred Years War erupted from 1337 to 1453 like a tempest as English and French crowns clashed in a brutal dance of territorial hunger. Edward III and his legendary Black Prince carved victory at Cr\u00e9cy and Poitiers, their martial prowess threatening to unravel the very fabric of the French kingdom. As the conflict raged, France stood at the precipice of dissolution until Joan of Arc rekindled hope and drove the English from its southern shores by 1453. The savage embrace of the war decimated France's population and left only half of its former self, yet paradoxically forged the crux of the English identity\u2014transforming scattered local spirits into a united national soul.

During this time, the supercontinent Pangaea - split into Laurasia and Gondwana, with the Gulf of Mexico - as it emerged between North America and the Yucatan Peninsula. The North Atlantic Ocean was relatively narrow, while the South Atlantic remained closed until the subsequent Cretaceous Period. The Tethys Sea closed and gave rise to the Neotethys area. Known for warm climates and absence of glaciation, the period lacked polar land masses or extensive ice caps. The geological record is particularly well-preserved in western Europe with extensive marine sequences and notable sites such as Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site and the Lagerst\u00e4tten Holzmaden and Solnhofen. The North American Jurassic record is in contrast sparse, with predominantly continental sediments such as the Morrison Formation and marine deposits from the Sundance Sea. The mid-Jurassic marked the beginning of significant batholithic emplacement in the northern Cordillera associated with the Nevadan orogeny. Important geological exposures from the Jurassic period are also documented in Russia, India, South America, Japan, Australasia and the United Kingdom.",

        "Despite efforts to revive Hebrew as the national language of the Jewish people, knowledge of the language is not universally widespread among Jews throughout the world, with English emerging as the primary lingua franca of the Jewish diaspora. Historically, many Jews possessed sufficient Hebrew to study the classic literature, and in the early 20th century Jewish languages were frequently used like Ladino and Yiddish. Nowadays, most Jews lack such linguistic proficiency and English largely has replaced most Jewish vernaculars. The three most commonly spoken languages among Jews are Hebrew, English and Russian, with some Romance languages, especially French and Spanish, also widely used. The Yiddish language, historically the most spoken among Jews, has declined significantly following the Holocaust and the adoption of modern Hebrew by the Zionist movement and the state of Israel. In some regions, the primary language of the Jewish community differs from the language of the dominant population. In Quebec, for example, the Ashkenazic majority has adopted English while the Sephardic minority uses French. Similarly, South African Jews adopted English rather than Afrikaans. Russian has replaced Yiddish as the language of Russian Jews due to the czarist and Soviet policies and affecting neighboring communities. Russian is now the first language for many Jewish communities in post-Soviet states like Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Tajikistan. Though North African Jewish communities have declined, they have previously transitioned to predominantly French-speaking in Algeria, Morocco and Tunis, while the wider population continued to use Arabic.",
        "The region now known as Galicia evolved from primordial depths, first inhabited during the Middle Paleolithic period, derived its name from the Gallaeci - Celestine - peoples dwelling north of the Douro River during the last millennium BC, their presence interwoven with the indigenous Castro culture of the Iron Age. At the conclusion of the Cantabrian Wars in 19 BC, Roman legions incorporated this verdant territory and transformed it into a province in the 3rd century AD. The Germanic Suebi formed their kingdom in Braga in 410, later absorbed by the Visigothic kingdom in 585. Although Arab invasions in 711 swept the Iberian Peninsula, Galicia quickly found refuge within the Christian Kingdom of Asturias in 740. Throughout the medieval period, Galicia oscillated between autonomous rule and allegiance to Le\u00f3n and Castile, steadfastly preserving its distinctive legal and cultural identity. Castilian monarchs appointed governors to administer the realm from the 13th century onwards, with the governor and Captain General ultimately presiding over the Royal Audiencia. The collective voice of the kingdom resonated through its cortes, an assembly of deputies representing urban centers, until administrative restructuring in 1833 dissolved its historical coherence. The subsequent centuries witnessed a growing clamor for self-determination, culminating in the 1936 and 1981 autonomous statutes that affirmed the enduring spirit of cultural distinctiveness in Galicia.",
        "Birds possess a highly efficient respiratory system characterized by a significantly greater surface area for gas exchange compared to mammals, with a tenfold increase in the ratio of surface area to gas exchange volume. The arterial network comprises thick, elastic muscles designed to withstand ventricular constriction, with increasing rigidity as vessels progress from the heart. Blood is transported through arteries undergoing vasoconstriction, then into arterial tissues that distribute oxygen and nutrients across the body. As arterioles penetrate individual organs, they further subdivide to maximize surface area and decelerate blood flow. Blood enters the capillaries and facilitates the gas exchange within intricate capillary beds where oxygen diffusion to tissues occurs through a deliberately slowed circulatory process. Deoxygenated blood subsequently traverses veins and veins and returns to the heart through vasodilation. The cardiac cycle progresses with blood entering the right atrium and then the right ventricle which pumps it through the lungs for carbon dioxide and oxygen exchange. Oxygenated blood subsequently flows through the left atrium to the left ventricle from which it is distributed throughout the systemic circulation of the body.",

        "As predicted by Nimitz, the Japanese fleet arrived off Midway on June 4 and was quickly spotted by PBY patrol aircraft. Nagumo launched a first strike against Midway while Fletcher responded by sending his aircraft towards Nagumo carriers. At 09:20, the first U.S. carrier plane \u2014 TBD Devastator torpedoes from Hornet \u2014 arrived, but their attacks were poorly coordinated and futile. They failed to score a single hit with all 15 aircraft decimated by defending Zero fighters. At 09:35, fifteen additional TBDs from Enterprise landed on the ground, with 14 lost aircraft and no successful strikes. Though Fletcher's initial attacks appeared disorganized and ineffective, they strategically drew Nagumo's defensive fighters to sea level, causing them to expend significant fuel and ammunition. When U.S. dive bombers arrived at high altitude subsequently, the Zeros were critically disadvantaged. Compounding the Japanese vulnerability, Nagumo\u2019s four carriers had drifted out of formation while evading torpedo attacks, diminishing their anti-aircraft defensive capabilities. Nagumo's indecision further sowed confusion, as he wavered between preparing a second strike on Midway and responding to the American carriers now in close proximity.

Vladimir assembled a Viking army with the support of Norwegian Earl Hkon Sigurdsson and successfully reconquered Novgorod and Kiev. As Prince of Kiev, his most significant achievement was the Christianization of Kievan Rus, a process that was initiated in 988. According to the primary chromosome, Vladimir sent trusted advisors to investigate religious options in Europe, studying Christian, Jewish and Muslim traditions.

        "Identity development emerges as a profound metamorphosis within the adolescent life cycle, a delicate journey of self-discovery where individuals navigate the complex landscape of personal transformation. During these formative years, adolescents become exploratory alchemists of themselves, boldly experimenting with diverse behaviors and appearances to unravel the essence of their emerging identity. This complex process involves cyclical iterations of persona as young individuals try tentatively on different identities, seeking resonance and authenticity. The path of identity development is fraught with challenges, intricately weaved with family dynamics, environmental influences and social contexts that shape and sometimes constrain personal exploration. Empirical research illuminates this journey as a nuanced process of identity development characterized by dynamic shifts in both the content and the structure of self-perception. Centred on this transformative experience are the twin pillars of self-clarity and self-esteem, which serve as navigational instruments guiding adolescents through the turbulent waters of personal growth. The choices made during these pivotal years cast long shadows, with heightened self-awareness and disciplined introspection potentially affecting the trajectory of future decision-making during mid-adolescence. As adolescents traverse this landscape, they emerge as more conscious beings, immersed in their physical and psychological metamorphosis, with their environment and socio-economic background influencing their intricate journey of self-discovery profoundly.",
        "Athanasius emerged from a crucible of scholarly and spiritual formation deeply influenced by the Martyrs of the Great Persecution, the last and most brutal assault on Christianity from pagan Rome. In particular in Egypt and Palestine, this era saw the martyrdom of Peter of Alexandria in 311, potentially one of Athanasius' first teachers. His mentor, the bishop Alexander of Alexandria, recognized Athanasius' extraordinary potential and invited him to serve as his companion and secretary. Athanasius was already distinguished by his profound education in grammar and rhetoric from a young age demonstrating remarkable wisdom and intellectual acumen. His earliest work Against the Heathen - On the Incarnation, revealed a nuanced engagement with philosophical traditions, deftly including Platonic and Aristotelian insight while maintaining orthodox theological foundations. Athanasius was deeply versed in philosophical discourse, including neo-Platonic developments and ultimately would reshape Alexandrian theological thought, moving beyond the purely allegorical interpretations of his predecessors. His intellectual breadth was apparent in his eclectic references. He drew not only from Christian sources, but also cited Homer and demonstrates a scholarly familiarity with classical rhetorical techniques, as seen in his eloquent defense of Emperor Constantius, which bore the unmistakable influence of Demosthenes.",
        "Egocentrism in adolescents manifests as a self-conscious desire to feel significant within peer groups and secure social acceptance. While self-concept encompasses fluctuating perceptions, identity represents a coherent and stable sense of self that integrates past experiences and future aspirations. Although everyone possesses a self-concept, Erikson argued that not all individuals achieve a complete identity. His development theory introduces the concept of identity crisis where adolescents must explore different possibilities and synthesize disparate aspects of themselves before establishing definitive beliefs. Erikson characterized the resolution of this process as a \"identity achievement\" while arguing that the development of identity is an ongoing, dynamic developmental journey. Adolescents begin by defining themselves through their affiliations with fashion as a critical mechanism for identity exploration. Clothing enables adolescents to differentiate themselves from parental influences, forge peer relationships and experiment with self-presentation. As fashion continually changes, it parallels the transformative nature of the adolescent personality development. Through deliberate styling and iterative self-presentation, adolescents navigate the complex process of aligning their perceived self-image with external perceptions. Media exposure positively influences this identity formation, providing continuous visual stimuli that affect self-perception consciously and subconsciously. The research methodology by James Marcia for assessing identity development categorizes individuals based on exploration and commitment across occupations, ideologies and interpersonal domains, ultimately amorphous them into stages ranging from identity distribution to identity achievement.",
        "Stanley Schachter built on the work of Spanish physician Gregorio Mara\u00f3n who discovered that patients injected with epinephrine experienced physiological arousal, but could not interpret their reactions without a clear emotional stimulus. Schachter proposed that emotions arise from a two-step process: physiological arousal general followed by cognitive assessment. He argued that physiological reactions contribute to emotional experience by facilitating a focused interpretation of an arousing event. For example, meeting a bear in the kitchen triggers heart pounding, and the brain quickly attributes this physiological response to fear. In conjunction with his student Jerome Singer, Schachter demonstrated that subjects in the same physiological state could experience different emotions depending on the situational stimulus. In their experiment, subjects injected with epinephrine exhibited either anger or amusement based on the emotional behavior of a confederate, suggesting that emotional response emerges from the interaction between physiological arousal and cognitive interpretation. This research, which highlights the complex interplay between body reactions and mental processes, has been critically examined by scholars such as Jesse Prinz in his 2004 research \"Gut Reactions.\"",
        "Hong Taiji's administrative tapestry was woven with Chinese crass moral threads, many of them newly surrendered Ming officials who brought depth and nuance to the emerging Manchu bureaucracy. An intricate ethnic quota system ensured the Manchus continued supremacy in the highest echelons of government. Hong Taiji radically departs from his father Nurhaci's mercurial approach to his Han subjects and embraced a more sophisticated strategy, transformating them from mere conquered peoples to integral members of the new Jurchen nation. Where Nurhaci had he previously managed the Han on their grain holdings and responded to the revolt with brutal repression in 1623, Hong Taiji instead chose a path of strategic inclusion. He incorporated these conquered peoples into the Jurchen Collective and gave them citizenship and military obligations, a policy that had dramatically altered the demographic composition of the Bannermen by 1648 - less than one-sixth of whom were of pure Manchu descent. This diplomatic alchemy expanded his martial capabilities, but also served as a compelling invitation to other Ming subjects and encouraged their peaceful surrender and allegiance. Hong Taiji deftly centralized the power with such nuanced statecraft and inoculated the Jurchen federation against potential fragmentation, laying the groundwork for a dynasty that would endure for centuries.",
        "The tech media website CNET has rated the Super Slim PlayStation 3 four out of five stars, praising its compact design while retaining the core features of the console. The review highlighted the system's robust gaming library and streaming services, but also outlined design limitations. The disc-loading mechanism was specifically criticised for feeling less refined compared to previous models. While acknowledging the console's smaller size and larger hard drive, the review suggested that these were not significant upgrades for existing PS3 owners. The process of replacement of the hard drive was commended for its simplicity. The review ultimately concluded that the Super Slim PS3 represents an incremental iteration rather than a revolutionary change and primarily recommended it to new buyers who can accept its mechanical trade-offs.",
        "DNA studies indicate that a limited number of founders in an ancient population dispersed along different migration routes may exist. In most Jewish populations, these male line ancestors appear to be primarily Middle Eastern origin. Ashkenazi Jews share more common paternal lines with other Jews and middle eastern populations than with non-Jewish populations in eastern Europe, Germany and the French Rhine Valley. This is aligned with Jewish traditions in the Middle East regarding paternal origins. Mitochondrial DNA studies show more diverse maternal lineages. Researchers suggest that during diaspora migrations Jewish males often integrated with local populations. Studies have found that about 40% of Ashkenazi Jews trace maternal lineages to four founders of Middle Eastern origin, while Sephardi and Mizrahi Jewish communities show greater maternal diversity. Subsequent research confirmed the significant proportion of non-local maternal origin among Ashkenazi Jews. Comparative genetic analyses reveal more substantial genetic differences between Jews and non-Jews than among various Jewish communities.",
        "The state gathered behind the Ayutla plan and passionately ratified the new constitution in 1855. Through the tumultuous Reform War, the region survived with remarkable resilience, bolstered by its formidable liberal political figures. Despite the bold military campaign of conservative Zuloaga, which saw him occupy Chihuahua and Parral with 1,000 men, the Liberal spirit of the State remained intact. In August 1859, Orozco defeated Zuloaga decisively, briefly deposing the state governor before being forced to retreat to Durango. The late 1860s were the brief but intense incursion of General Cajen, sweeping through the state following his Jalisco campaign and slaying liberal leaders Jess Gonz\u00e1lez Ortega and Jos\u00e9 Mara Patoni. In the state capital, Cajen established himself as a governor and quickly stopped liberal resistance in La Batalla del Gallo. His triumph was short-lived though, as liberal forces quickly regained momentum. Jos\u00e9 Mara Patoni of Durango and J.E. Muoz of Chihuahua undermining conservative power by restricting clerical political rights strategically. Ultimately the state elected General Luis Terrazas, a resolute liberal leader, as Governor, who continued to suppress conservative uprisings with unwavering determination throughout 1861.",
        "Adolescents face significant risks in contemporary society as their sexuality changes. These risks include emotional distress, sexually transmitted infections and pregnant women. One in four sexually active teenagers will contract an STI, with girls aged 15 to 19 experiencing the highest rates of gonorrhea. Across the United States, clinicians report rising diagnoses of Herpes and human papillomavirus (HPV), which affects approximately 15 percent of the teenage population. One-quarter of all new HIV cases occur in individuals under 21 years old. Despite these challenges, most parents (81 percent) want schools to discuss condoms and contraception, and support STI testing for students. However, a significant disconnect exists: while 90 percent of sex education instructors believe students should learn about contraceptives, more than 25 percent of school administrators explicitly exclude this. anthropologist Margaret Mead argued that adolescent angst in Western society stems from cultural rather than physical factors, noting that societies with more sexually open young women experience less teenage angst.",
        "Over the last four centuries, the deeper ancestral demography of Bermuda's population has been obscured by ethnic homogenization. Initially, white Protestants of English heritage dominated the settlement, accompanied by white minority of Irish and Scots displaced after the English Civil War. Non-white minorities included free blacks from the West Indies, chattel slaves captured from Spanish and Portuguese ships and Native Americans from various tribes along the Atlantic coast and possibly from Mexico. By the 19th century, the white English Bermudians lost their numerical majority, with the merging of minority groups creating a new demographic category of \"coloured\" Bermudians, defined as anyone of European descent. Any child born to mixed parents was classified as \"coloured,\" a term now largely replaced by \"black\" or \"of African heritage,\" which inadvertently masks the complex racial heritage of the population. Despite attempts to restrict immigration and demographic mixing, blacks have maintained their majority with new white immigration from Portugal, Britain and elsewhere balanced by black immigration from the West Indies. The evolving demographic landscape reflects the intricate historical and cultural transformations on the island.",
        "The immunological response of the body is intricately modulated by a complex interplay of factors such as age, antigen characteristics, maternal influences and presentation site. Neonates exist in a state of profound physiological immunodeficiency, with both innate and adaptive immune mechanisms significantly suppressed. The infant's immune system displays a selective response after birth, readily engaging protein antigens while exhibiting markedly reduced reactivity to glycoproteins and polysaccharides. Neonates are subsequently particularly susceptible to infections from low-virulence organisms such as Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas. Their immunological defenses are critically compromised with opsonic activity and complement cascade activation severely restricted. Notably, a newborn's mean C3 complement level hovers around 65% of adult concentrations, while phagocytic capabilities are significantly impaired due to reduced opsonic activity and limited integrin and selectin receptor up-regulation. Neutrophil interactions with endothelial adhesion molecules are therefore constrained. Monocytes function sluggishly, with reduced ATP production further compromising phagocytic efficiency. Despite having a higher lymphocyte count than adult patients, cellular and humoral immunity remains highly limited. Antigen-presenting cells show reduced T-cell activation potential, while T cells proliferate poorly and generate minimal cytokine volumes, substantially hindering the humoral response and the macrophage phagocytic activity. Although B cells emerge early during pregnancy, they remain functionally immature.",
        "Established Rock Acts continue to achieve significant commercial success throughout the 1990s. Aerosmith released two multi-platinum albums, Get a Grip (1993) and Nine Lives (1997), with the first becoming their worldwide best-selling release, selling over 10 million copies. Their single from 1998 \"I Don't Want to Miss a Thing\" became the only hard rock band single to debut at number one. AC/DC produced the double platinum Ballbreaker (1995), while Bon Jovi demonstrated remarkable versatility by appealing to hard rock audiences with tracks like \"Keep the Faith\" (1992) and simultaneously achieving adult contemporary success with Top 10 Ballads \"Bed of Roses\" (1993) and \"Always\" (1994). Their 1995 album These Days performed particularly well in Europe, generating four Top 10 singles on the UK Singles Chart. Metallica\u2019s load (1996) and ReLoad (1997) exceeded 4 million US sales each, reflecting the band\u2019s evolving melodic and blues rock sound. As Grunge's initial momentum waned, post-Grunge bands emerged, emulating Grunge's aesthetic while offering a more commercially accessible approach. Prominent acts like Foo Fighters, Candlebox, Live, Collective Soul, Silverchair, and Bush had achieved post-grunge status as a commercially viable subgenre by the end of the decade. Similarly, post-britpop bands such as Feeder and Stereophonics incorporated hard rock and pop metal elements into their musical style.",
        "In a chilling revelation issued in 2002 by the Guardian, government documents revealed the covert transformation of Britain between 1940 and 1979 into a clandestine biological testing facility. These secret experiments systematically unleashed potentially hazardous chemicals and microorganisms across vast populated regions without public consent or awareness. While the Ministry claimed these trials were harmless simulations of germ warfare, affected families report alarming consequences, including children born with significant physical and mental disabilities. The scope of these experiments was staggering, with an estimated million of residents along England's southern coast\u2014from Torquay to the New Forest\u2014unwittingly exposed to dangerous bacteria such as e.coli and bacillus globigii, which mimics anthrax. Despite assurances from ministry-appointed scientists and Porton Down representative that these trials would ultimately \"save lives\" in potential biowaffen scenarios, the long-term implications remain buried in uncertainty. When asked about the ongoing research, official responses remained cryptically non-binding, leaving fundamental questions about the true nature and impact of these experiments unanswered.",
        "Like reptiles, birds are primarily uricotelic, removing nitrogenous waste from their bloodstream and extinguishing it as uric acid into the intestine. Birds lack a urinary bladder and an external urethral opening, and (with the exception of ostriches) uric acid is excreted alongside feces as a semisolid waste. Some birds, such as hummingbirds, can be facultatively ammonotelic and excret most nitrogenous wastes as ammonia. They excrete creatine rather than creatinine, as mammals do. This material emerges from the cloaca of the bird, a multi-purpose opening used for waste expulsion, mating and egg laying. Many birds regurgitate also pellets. Males within Palaeognathae (except kiwis), Anseriformes (except screamers) and in rudimentary forms in Galliformes (completely developed in Cracidae) possess a penis which is absent in Neoaves. The length of the penis is believed to correlate with sperm competition and remains hidden within the proctodeum compartment of the cloaca when not in use. The avian digestive system is distinctive, with a crop for storage and a gizzard containing swallowed stones to compensate for the lack of teeth. Most birds are highly adapted for quick digestion to support flight, with some migratory species capable of utilizing protein from various body tissues, including intestinal protein, as additional energy during migration.",
        "Regarding the timing of the German rapprochement, many historians concur that the dismissal of Maxim Litvinov whose Jewish ethnicity was viewed unfavorably by Nazi Germany removed a significant diplomatic obstacle. Stalin immediately directed Molotov to \"purge the ministry of the Jews\" Litvinov's earlier advocacy for an anti-fascist coalition, commitment to collective security with France and Britain and pro-West orientation by Kremlin standards suggests that his dismissal indicated a possible Soviet option for rapprochement with Germany. The nomination of Molotov simultaneously signaled the openness of the USSR to negotiations and to France and Britain the existence of alternative diplomatic routes. British officials reported Litvinov's departure as the loss of an adept diplomatic technician, contrasting with Molotov's more ideologically driven \"modus operandi\". Historians like Carr argued that Stalin's replacement of Litvinov by Molotov on May 3 of 1939 represented a strategic negotiation tactic rather than an irrevocable alignment with Germany. Albert Resis claimed that Litvinov's dismissal provided Soviets with diplomatic flexibility without abandoning British-French talks, while Derek Watson and Geoffrey Roberts emphasized Molotov's renegotiated position and the potential diplomatic advantages of Litvinov's removal.",
        "The Guangxu Emperor died on November 14, 1908, followed by Cixi's death the next day. Persistent rumors suggested that she or Yuan Shikai had ordered trusted eunuchs to poison the Guangxu Emperor - a claim that was substantiated nearly a century later by an autopsy revealing lethal arsenic concentrations. Puyi, the two-year-old oldest son of Zaifeng, Prince Chun and nephew to the childless Emperor Guangxu, was appointed successor, with Zaifeng the regency assuming. He soon followed General Yuan Shikai's defection from his positions of power. In April 1911, Zaifeng established a cabinet with two vice-premiers which was dubbed the Royal Cabinet by the contemporaries due to five of its thirteen members being imperial family or Aisin Gioro relatives, drawing sharp criticism from senior officials like Zhang Zhidong. The Wuchang Uprising on 10 October 1911 precipitated the formation of a new central government, the Republic of China, under Sun Yat-sen's provisional leadership in Nanjing with many provinces rapidly dissolving from Qing control. Confronting this desperate situation, the Qing government reinstated Yuan Shikai to military power and deployed his Beiyang army to suppress the revolution in Wuhan at the Battle of Yangxia. After securing the position of Prime Minister and forming his own cabinet Yuan Shikai demanded Zaifeng's release from the regency, a request that was finally executed under Empress Dowager Longyu's direction.",
        "As a young boy, Schwarzenegger was deeply influenced by his father and immersed himself with passion in sports. In 1960, his soccer coach introduced him to his first barbell \u2013 a remarkably transformative journey. He chose bodybuilding as his intended path to the age of 14 and dropped soccer. His commitment was acrimonious; he would break into the local gym at Graz during weekends driven by an insatiable desire to train. \"I would be sick to miss a workout if I did not look myself in the mirror the next morning,\" he said. Inspired by bodybuilding icons like Reg Park, Steve Reeves and Johnny Weissmuller, whom he watched in local movie theaters, Schwarzenegger developed a vision of extraordinary potential. When he met former Mr. Austria Kurt Marnul in 1961, who invited him to train, his trajectory was set. During an interview with his early idol Steve Reeves, Schwarzenegger said later: \"His remarkable accomplishments gave me a sense of what was possible, while others around me didn't always understand my dreams.\" While his parents envisioned different futures\u2014his father hoped he would become a police officer, his mother aspiring to attend the trade school \u2014Schwarzenegger was charting his own remarkable course, fueled by an unbreakable spirit and monumental ambition.",
        "In the echoing decades of the 1930s, we forged through the heart of Thuringia the strings of asphalt, weaving stories of connection and progress. The A4, a steel artery that intrudes east to west, embraced the landscape from Frankfurt through the luminous towns of Weimar\u2014Eisenach, Erfurt and Berlin\u2014whispering stories of south-west Germany. Its companion, the A9, stretched from north to south like a silver thread, binding Berlin and Munich in a quiet embrace. After reunification, these roads breathed and expanded, their lanes multiplicating like veins of possibility. The A71 through the emerald depths of the Thuringian forest carved mountains into the Rennsteig Tunnel\u2014the longest road passage in Germany\u2014a testament to human determination.

        "Public priests were appointed by the Collegia, with elected individuals holding a permanent religious authority that was extracted from the Divine. This conferred lifetime influence, privilege and immunity. Civil and religious law meticulously regulated the number and nature of religious offices for an individual and their family. Religious law, deeply colloquial and traditional, can be substantially informed and could potentially overturn political decisions while resisting personal exploitation. Priesthood represented a costly honour: priests in the traditional Roman practice received no stipend. Cult donations remained the property of the deity, with priests obligated to maintain cult services regardless of public funding constraints, potentially requiring personal financial subsidies of acolytes and cult maintenance. For those who had finished the Cursus honorum, the permanent priesthood was optimally pursued or granted after a lifetime of military or political service, representing an honorable and active form of retirement that satisfied important public duties. For freedmen or slaves, appointment to Compitalia seviri offered enhanced local political and business opportunities. The Imperial cult priesthood provided provincial elites Roman citizenship and public prominence in the Imperial era, effectively constituting the initial stage of a provincial cursus honorum. In Rome, the Arval Brethren were a comparable Imperial Cult role, transforming from an obscure Republican priesthood to an institutionalized body dedicated to state religious ceremonies. They offered prayers and sacrifices to Roman state deities at various temples, ensuring the welfare of the Imperial Family during birthdays, birth anniversary and significant events, such as suppressing conspiracies or revolts. On January 3 they consecrated vows and fulfilled prior sacrifices contingent upon the protection of the gods of the Imperial family.",
        "When Nintendo boldly launched the NES in the US they crafted a revolutionary design that defied convention and deliberately shattered themselves from the tainted landscape of the gaming consoles in the wake of the devastating video game crash in 1983. Their innovative solution was a front loading mechanism which mimicked a VCR, a disguised cartridge slot that promised sophistication and reliability. Initially, the innovative Zero Injector Force (ZIF) connector performed admirably when pristine, but the harsh reality of repeated use exposed its fundamental flaws. Each cartridge insertion subtly bent delicate contact pins and stressed internal components, eroding the system's structural integrity gradually. The seemingly clever design became a logical vulnerability - dust and dirt easily compromising connections - while the nickel connector springs and copper cartridge contacts rapidly deteriorated. Ironically, players' well-intentioned attempts to revive functioning games by blowing them into cartridges only accelerated the corrosion, creating a frustrating cycle of technological compromise that would become legendary in gaming history.",
        "In Homer's Iliad the Danaans and Argives designate the Greek forces confronting the Trojans, rooted in a rich mythological tapestry. The legendary Danaus, emerging from Egyptian origins, anchors a foundational narrative of Argos. His daughters, the Danaides, were condemned in Tartarus to an eternal, futile task; he twisted endlessly to fill a bottomless bathtub\u2014a haunting metaphor for impossible labor. Etymologically linked to the proto-Indo-European root *danu, meaning \"river\" their name whispers of fluid origins and primordial movements. Scholarly investigations trace potential connections to the Denyen, a maritime people that challenged Egypt during the reign of Ramesses III. Archaeological evidence suggests intricate migrations, with Mycenaean pottery discovered in Cilicia's Tarsus, hints at Aegean refugees seeking new perspectives following their civilization's collapse. Inscriptions from various ancient cultures\u2014Hittite, Egyptian and Amarna\u2014repetition variants of this name : Dananiyim, Danuna, Danaoi\u2014each echoing a complex, migratory heritage that transcends simple geographical boundaries. The name potentially signifies \"people living by the river\" or nomadic groups, reflecting a profound connection to fluid landscapes and transient existence.",
        "Anthropologists such as C. Loring Brace, the philosophers Jonathan Kaplan and Rasmus Winther and the geneticist Joseph Graves noted that while biological and genetic variation may correspond to continental groupings, this is true for most geographically distinct populations. The cluster structure of the genetic data depends on the initial research hypotheses and the sampled populations. Different sampling patterns would yield different clustering results. Weiss and Fullerton demonstrated that by sampling only Icelanders, Mayans and Maoris they would form three distinct clusters with other populations describable as admixtures of these genetic materials. Kaplan and Winther argue that while racial groups exhibit different allele frequencies, this does not constitute a natural human species taxonomy as multiple genetic patterns racial disparities overlap. Genomic data does not definitively support either subdivision or continuum interpretations. They view racial groups as objective social constructions with a conventional biological reality constructed for specific scientific purposes. Winther distinguated between \"diversity partitioning\" and \"clustering analysis\" as separate methodological approaches with distinct questions, assumptions, protocols and ontological implications concerning race.",
        "In the tapestry of American monetary design, the US dollar emerged as a decimal symphony that drew beyond the Spanish milled precedent. The Coinage Act orchestrated a harmonious system of monetary units\u2014the mill's whispered thousandth, the cent's humble hundredth, the dime's graceful tenth and the eagle's bold ten-dollar wingspan. Though visionaries once dreamed of a \"unit ian\" coin at fifty dollars, ephemeral patterns flickered in the numismatic realm. Cents rule in everyday transactions, while \"dime\" sounds as the proper name of a coin, and \"eagle\" and \"mill\" drift like forgotten legends\u2014except for tax calculations and gasoline fractional pricing. Modern currency breathes through coins beneath a dollar and Federal Reserve notes above, with precious metal coins sometimes punctuating the monetary landscape.

        "Sir Steve Redgrave, who began the relay with a mix of anticipation and anxiety, revealed the emotional weight of the moment by sharing e-mailed pleas to boycott the event, acknowledging the complex tensions surrounding the Olympic torch. Francesca Martinez and Richard Vaughan chose principled silence by refusing to carry the torch, while Konnie Huq navigated a nuanced path, carrying the torch but expressing strongly against China's human rights record. The passionate appeal of pro-Tibetan member of parliament Norman Baker directed bearers to reconsider their participation. The awkward encounter of Prime Minister Gordon Brown with the torch\u2014welcoming it without physical contact\u2014symbolized the delicate diplomatic dance. The London exchange unfolded like a hot political drama, with the BBC describing the torch in a \"mobile protective ring\" as protesters and supporters clashed. Arrests erupted immediately with at least thirty-five demonstrators detained. Dramatic moments punctuated the relay: a protester's attempt to snatch the torch from Konnie Huq, a fire extinguisher being discharged nearby, and the secretive passage of the Chinese ambassador to Chinatown. The unpredictable journey of the torch\u2014slipping into a bus along Fleet Street to evade the protesters\u2014echoed the day's underlying tensions. In response to the pro-Tibet demonstrations, over 2,000 Chinese supporters rallied along the route, their signs and flags proclaiming the Olympic spirit of \"One World, One Dream\" in Trafalgar Square.",
        "Hard Rock Bands from the 1970s and 1980s demonstrated remarkable resilience by sustaining successful recordings well into the new millennium. With their double platinum-certified album Crush (2000), Bon Jovi was a commercial hit and AC/DC released the platinum-certified stiff Upper Lip in the same year. Aerosmith extended their musical range with the number two platinum album Just Push Play (2001), featuring the top 10 hit \"Jaded\" and later released the blues cover album Honkin' on Bobo, which reached number five in 2004. Heart made history in 2010 when it became the first female-led hard rock band to earn Top 10 albums across five decades with Red Velvet Car, along with a unique Led Zeppelin performance in 2007, involving Van Halen (with both Hagar and Roth) and Black Sabbath. Hard rock supergroups like Audioslave and Velvet Revolver appeared, though they were short-lived and disbanded in 2007 and 2008, respectively. In 2008 Guns N' Roses released the long-awaited Chinese Democracy which went platinum, but failed to match its earlier success. AC/DC found more significant success with its double platinum-certified black Ice (2008). Bon Jovi continued to evolve, branching into country music in 2007 with the chart-topping single \"Who Says You Can't Go Home\" and the rock country album Lost Highway before returning to their hard rock roots with The Circle in 2009.",
        "In modern professional wrestling, numerous specialty matches were developed with distinctive winning conditions. The ladder match represents a prominent example, where wrestlers or teams must ascend a ladder to retrieve a suspended prize. The strategic objective involves neutralizing opponents sufficiently so as to enable one wrestler to climb and secure the prize. Consequently, the ladder itself becomes a potential weapon. Prizes can include championship belts, documentation granting future title opportunities or other important documents that will be relevant to participants. Another prevalent special match is the Battle Royal, where 20-30 wrestlers simultaneously occupy the ring. The primary goal is to eliminate opponents by forcing them over the top rope with both feet touching the floor. The final wrestler remaining is declared the victor. A notable variation is the WWE Royal Rumble, which begins with two wrestlers and gradually introduces other competitors at 90 second intervals until 30-40 wrestlers have entered. The fundamental elimination rules remain consistent throughout the match.",
        "By March 2011, the OS X market share had risen slightly to approximately 14% in North America, igniting ongoing debates about the significance of the Mac market presence. In the early and mid-90s, industry pundits regularly predicted Apple's demise, citing its diminutive market share as evidence of an imminent collapse. However, Apple strategically positioned the Mac as a premium personal computer, challenging traditional metrics of success. The rapidly expanding personal computer market obscured the growing sales of Macs, creating an illusion of stagnation while the actual Mac use steadily increased. The introduction of the iPhone and iPad further transformed the financial landscape of Apple, with Macintosh profits declining from 46% to 24% in 2010. Despite these fluctuations, Apple maintained profitability following Steve Jobs' return and subsequent organizational restructuring. A surprising 2008 report revealed Apple's impressive 66% share of computers with prices over $1,000, underscoring the brand's appeal to a discerning, high-income demographic. This nuanced perspective suggests that market share alone can inadequately capture the true market impact and strategic positioning of the Mac.",

After Sandberg's retirement and Dunston's departure, the Cubs found hope in Henry Rodrguez, \" H-Rod \", whose powerful bat provided crucial protection for Sammy Sosa. Kevin Tapani's career-defining 19 wins, Rod Beck's bullpen mastery and Mark Grace's stellar performance laid the groundwork for an unforgettable season. The media spotlighted Sosa and rookie phenom Kerry Wood with Wood's electrifying one-hit, 20-hit masterpiece against the Astros earning him the moniker \"Kid K\" and NL Rookie of the Year crown. Sosa's June eruption\u201420 home runs in a single month\u2014ignited a legendary home run race with Mark McGwire that captivated the nation. Even though McGwire ultimately claimed the record with 70 home runs, Sosa's.308 average and 66 home runs secured the MVP title. A dramatic Wild Card playoff at Wrigley Field saw Gary Gaetti  s heroic homer drive the Cubs to a season 90-73. Their postseason dreams crumbled against Atlanta, batting a mere.183, but the summer's epic home run chase had already rekindled baseball's spirit, drawing new fans and healing wounds from the 1994 strike. Magic proved to be fleeting, by 1999 dissolved the Cubs' initial promise into divisional mediocrity.",

Clad in traditional gleaming Sakurai armor and carrying an energetic katana, this character has made over 350 comic book appearances and is playable in popular video games like Marvel Vs. Capcom. In 2013, the Samurai villain appeared in James Mangold\u2019s film The Wolverine, building on a cinematic tradition established by The Last Samurai in 2003. The film, starring Tom Cruise, explores the Samurai way of life through Nathan Algren, a US Army Captain who travels during the Meiji Period to Japan to train a rookie army against samurai rebels. After being captured by the Samurai, Algren becomes deeply immersed in their culture, eventually joining their clan and adopting their traits, including zen-like sword mastery and a deep spiritual understanding. The film serves as a narrative bridge, making the nineteenth-century Japanese history available to American audiences by presenting a transformative journey of cultural understanding.",
        "A predator is an organism that kills and consumes another living entity. Predation does not involve the direct killing of the prey like other forms of damage. Predators employ diverse hunting strategies, including active pursuit or ambush tactics. Some predators de-spin big prey before consumption, such as jaguars or humans, while others ingest large prey whole, like bottlenose dolphins swallowing fish or snakes frogs. Certain animals, like domestic cats and dogs, adapt their roosting method based on the size of prey. Some predators use venom to subdue or kill prey, as seen in box jellyfish and cone shells, with some venoms even initiating prey digestion. In some cases, prey may die within the digestive system of the predator, as illustrated by baleen whales consuming massive quantities of plankton. Seed and egg predation are also considered true predation as these represent potential organisms. Predators should not consume entire prey; some can not digest certain body parts, while others may consume an organism partially, causing its death ultimately.",
        "In 680 Ibn al-Zubayr fled Medina to Mecca. At hearing of Husayn's opposition to Yazid I, the people of Kufa invited him to lead them. Al-Husayn sent his cousin Muslims bin Agail to confirm their support. When Yazid learned of this, he sent Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad, the ruler of Basrah, to prevent Kufa from rallying behind Al-Husayn. Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad successfully dispersed the crowd surrounding Muslim bin Agail and captured him subsequently. Recognizing Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad\u2019s intention to undermine his potential support, Muslim Bin Agail sought to warn Husayn against traveling to Kufa. His request was denied and Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad executed Muslim bin Agail While Ibn al-Zubayr remained in Mecca until his death, Husayn proceeded to Kufa with his family, unaware of the lack of local support. Yazid I's forces, led by Amru bin Saad, Shamar bin Thi al-Joshan and Hussain bin Tamim, intercepted and captured Husayn and his male family members and ultimately killed them. Husayn's caravan of 200 people, including women, children, sisters, wives and daughters was captured and taken to Damascus to be presented to Yazid I. They remained confined until public sentiment shifted in response to the news of Husayn's death and the captivity of his family. Afterwards, they were permitted to return to Medina. Ali ibn Husayn, who was severely ill with fever, was the only adult male survivor of the caravan.",
        "The Guadalupe Hidalgo Treaty, signed by American diplomat Nicholas Trist and Mexican plenipotentiary representatives Luis G. Cuevas, Bernardo Couto and Miguel Atristain on February 2, 1848, ended the war definitively, gave the U.S. undisputed control over Texas and established the Rio Grande as the definitive border. As news of peace negotiations began to spread across the territories, a volatile undercurrent of tension began to simmer among the populace. When Mexican officials in Chihuahua learned that General Price was returning from Santa Fe with a formidable force of infantry, cavalry and light artillery to Mexico on February 8, 1848, ngel Tras sent a message to Sacramento Pass requesting the peaceful surrender of the area and recognizing the end of the war. General Price interpreted this communication as a potential Mexican deception and continued his relentless advance towards the state capital. On March 16, 1848, Price initiated negotiations with ngel Tras, who responded with an unyielding ultimatum. The subsequent battle of Santa Cruz de los Rosales, the final confrontation of the war, erupted despite the prior signing of the Peace Treaty. American forces maintained control over the state capital for three months, effectively postponing potential state succession and halting the region under occupation by the United States until May 22, 1848.",

Despite the initial tension, West and Khalifa quickly reconciled. Just days before the album's debut, West reimagined the project, christening it The Life of Pablo. On February 11 he transformed Madison Square Garden into a cultural moment, previewing the album alongside his fashion line. Obsessively refining the work, he continued tweaking the track list and recording, ultimately publishing the album exclusively on Tidal on 14 February after a memorable SNL performance, marking another exciting chapter in his artistic evolution.",
        "The absence of an effective royal justice system in the kingdom ignited the smoldering tensions of the Guerras Irmandi\u00e1s ('Wars of Brotherhoods'), a turbulent uprising where leagues of peasants and burghers, supported by the tacit support of sympathetic knights and noblemen, unleashed their fury against the oppressive nobility. With the legal protection of the distant king as their shield, they demolished the towering castles and forced the aristocratic elite to exile in Portugal and Castile. In the late 15th century, the dynastic conflict between Isabella I of Castile and Joanna La Beltraneja erupted, with a segment of the Galician aristocracy rallying behind Joanna. Following Isabella's decisive victory, she launched an administrative and political transformation that the chronicler Jeronimo Zurita poetically described as the \"doma del reino de Galicia\" - a brutal taming of a fierce and fractious land. These vast reforms establish a local government and tribunal, the Real Audiencia del Reino de Galicia, which seized the local lords and brought most Galician monasteries and institutions under Castilian control, a process later criticized as a calculated centralization. Simultaneously, the monarchs formed the Xunta or Cortes of the Kingdom of Galicia, an assembly of city deputies that would evolve into the eloquent voice and legal embodiment of the Kingdom's collective will and legislative power.",
        "Terry Eastland, author of \"From Ending Affirmative Action: The Case for Colorblind Justice\", categorizes arguments for affirmative action into two primary types : addressing past discrimination and promoting diversity. Eastland contends that the implementation of the policy primarily benefited the Middle Class minority, contrary to its original intent. Also, she suggests that affirmative action may create a stigma that may potentially impact minority self-perception and expectations. Libertarian economist Thomas Sowell identifies several potential consequences of affirmative action around the world in his book, \"Affirmative Action Around the World: An Empirical Study.\" Sowell argues that affirmative action can incentivize group reclassification, predominantly benefit more advantaged members of preferred groups, potentially disadvantage less privileged members of non-preferred groups, reduce performance motivation across groups and potentially cause intergroup tensions.",
        "Picture the grand Senate chamber, where a centuries-old tradition unfolds. The day begins with a notice of imminent arrival of Governor General. As anticipation grows, the Senate cannot adjourn. The speaker takes a seat beside the throne, the Mace Bearer at attention. Suddenly the Governor General enters and takes the chair. With a dramatic command, the Speaker instructs the Speaker of the Black Rod to summon the members of parliament. They arrive led by the Sergeant-at-Arms with the House of Commons mace. Standing behind the bar, MPs watch as Black Rod approaches the Governor General. Royal Assent is granted to the bills with a simple nod. The clerk of the Senate then formally declares the assent in Her Majesty's name. For bills of appropriation, a similar ceremonial process follows, with the Speaker of the House of Commons reading titles and the Senate Clerk echoes them. The Governor General nods again to finalize the assent. In a final, solemn moment, the Senate Clerk acknowledges the loyalty of the subjects and the benefit of the bills. And then the governor general walked onwards and left behind the weight of Parliamentary tradition.",
        "The early and mid-1980s plunged Libya into economic turmoil, with oil revenues disappearing from a staggering $21 billion to a mere $5.4 billion between 1982 and 1986. In 1983, amid this financial strain, Gaddafi launched his ambitious \"Great Man-made River\" project, a massive irrigation project that would remain in the 21st century. As military spending increased, administrative budgets drained. Libya's regional ambitions burned bright, with continued support for FROLINAT in Chad and a controversial military intervention in December 1980. The Organisation of African Unity repeatedly condemned Gaddafi's aggressive foreign policy, with nine African states dissolving diplomatic ties by 1980. In a surprising diplomatic maneuver, Gaddafi signed the Oujda Treaty with the Moroccan monarch Hassan II in August 1984, forming the Arab-African Union \u2014 a union as fragile as it was unexpected and ultimately dissolved in 1986 due to underlying political tensions. Domestic challenges consistently threatened Gaddafi's regime, culminating in a failed militia attack on his compound in Bab al-Azizia in May 1984, which triggered a brutal crackdown resulting in 5,000 dissidents being arrested.",
        "Sound could be stored in either analogue or digital format across various surround sound configurations. NTSC discs could carry two analog audio tracks and two uncompressed PCM digital audio tracks (EFM, CIRC, 16-bit and 44.056 kHz sample rate). PAL discs could carry one pair of audio tracks, either analog or digital, with digital tracks that could be similar to CDs in 16 bit 44.1 kHz specification. In the UK, \"LaserVision\" refers to discs with analog sound, while \"LaserDisc\" denotes those with digital audio. The digital sound signal in both formats was EFM-encoded, comparable to CDs. Dolby Digital (AC-3) and DTS (now common on DVD titles) first became available on LaserDisc with Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace (1999) being among the first home video releases to include Dolby Digital EX Surround 6.1 Channel. Unlike DVDs, which store Dolby Digital audio in digital form, LaserDiscs Dolby Digital in a frequency-modulated format inside an analog audio track were stored. Extracting Dolby Digital from a LaserDisc required a player with a special AC-3 RF input, an external demodulator and an AC-3 decoder. The demodulator converted the 2.88 MHz modulated AC-3 information into a signal 384 kbit/s compatible with the decoder. When available, DTS audio replaced the digital audio tracks and could be accessed over an S/PDIF compliant digital connection to a DTS decoder.",
        "From his diagrams of particle interactions in spacetime, Feynman developed comprehensive models of physics based on particle spins and fundamental force couplings. He proposed the parton model as an alternative explanation for strong interactions governing nucleon scattering, which complemented the quark model created by his Caltech colleague Murray Gell-Mann. The relationship between these models remained complex, with Gell-Mann dismissively referring to Feynman's partons as  Put-ons . During the mid-1960s, physicists considered quarks primarily a theoretical construct for symmetry calculations and not actual particles, due to seemingly impossible statistical implications for the Omega-minus particle. In the late 1960s, the deep inelastic scattering experiments by the Stanford linear accelerator, reminiscent of Rutherford's alpha particle scattering, revealed point-like particles in nucleons that scattered electrons. While these particles were naturally associated with quarks, Feynman's Parton model sought to interpret experimental data without adding additional hypotheses. The data indicated that approximately 45% of energy momentum was carried by electrically neutral particles now understood as gluons that mediate inter-quarker forces and resolve the Omega-minus-problem through their color quantum number. Feynman remained supportive of the quark model and when the fifth quark was discovered in 1977 he promptly predicted the existence of a sixth quark, which was confirmed posthumously.",
        "In the late years of 1203, John attempted to relieve Ch\u00e2teau Gaillard, a strategic fortress protecting the eastern flank of Normandy which was under siege by Philip. John wrote a synchronized operation with land and water forces - an approach historians consider innovative yet too complex for the military capabilities of the time. Philip's forces blocked John's relief attempt and brought John back to Brittany in an attempt to distract Philip from the east of Normandy. While John successfully devastated much of Brittany, he failed to divert Philip's primary assault on eastern Normandy. Historians' assessment of John's military prowess vary, with most recent scholars considering his performance as underdeveloped. The situation of John rapidly deteriorated as Philip had for years methodically cultivated the eastern border region of Normandy, and Angevin authority had been weakened by Richard's previous strategic concessions to the south. John's reliance on routier mercenaries in central regions further eroded his support, thereby setting the stage for an imminent collapse of Angevin power. In December, John returned across the Channel to establish a new defensive line to the west of Ch\u00e2teau Gaillard. By February 1204 Gaillard fell, and John's mother Eleanor died the following month\u2014a personal tragedy that threatened the Angevin alliances in southern France. Philip swiftly advanced and bypassed the new defensive line and blasted with minimal resistance at the heart of the Duchy. By August, Philip had conquered Normandy and occupied Anjou and Poitou, leaving John with only the duchy of Aquitaine.",
        "In 2013, a groundbreaking study of Ashkenazi mitochondrial DNA by Martin B. Richards from the University of Huddersfield revealed a nuanced genetic tapestry. Digging deeply into the full 16,600 DNA units, researchers discovered that the four primary Ashkenazi foundings traced their lineage deep into European soil, with roots spanning 10,000 to 20,000 years into antiquity. The study illuminated a profound narrative of genetic assimilation, revealing that most maternal lines were not transplanted from the Near East or the Caucasus, but were rather woven from the rich genetic fabric of Europe, predominantly Italian and old French. Richards debunked the persistent Khazar hypothesis with eloquence and said the genetic evidence thoroughly discredits myths of distant origins. The research estimated that 80 percent of Ashkenazi maternal ancestry came from indigenous European women, with merely 8 percent originating in the Near East, while the remaining lineage remained enigmatic. Ultimately, the study suggested a compelling narrative of cultural transformation, highlighting the significant role of women's conversion in the intricate formation of Ashkenazi communities.",
        "The Maison Cubiste (Cubist House) emerged at the Salon d'Automne in 1912 as a groundbreaking architectural installation conceived by Raymond Duchamp-Villon, Andr\u00e9 Mare and their collaborators. Metzinger and Gleizes articulated in their lyrical du \u201cCubisme\u201d a revolutionary perspective on the autonomy of art, arguing that decorative considerations should not constrain artistic expression. They posited that a true artwork has an intrinsic essence capable of transcending specific spatial contexts and merging with the universal. The installation embodied this philosophy, with a fully furnished interior with a staircase, wrought iron benches and Salon Bourgeois \u2014 a space where works by prominent Cubist artists included Marcel Duchamp, Metzinger, Gleizes, Laurencin and L\u00e9ger are displayed. Christopher Green notes that Mare\u2019s design created a deliberate interplay of contrasts, giving paintings and sculptures their independent aesthetic language. At Salon d\u2019Automne, Spectators encountered the 10-by-3-meter plaster fa\u00e7ade designed by Duchamp-Villon, an architectural model which would be displayed in 1913 at the Armory Show in New York, Chicago and Boston. As an exemplar of L'art d\u00e9coratif, the Maison Cubiste represented a bold reimagining of the relation of art to domestic space, challenging the traditional boundaries between artistic expression and everyday life.",
        "Rock musicians today are increasingly incorporating Mandolins, often single-string electric models, into their musical repertoire and challenging traditional genre boundaries. Tim Brennan of Dropkick Murphys exemplifies this trend, using the mandolin alongside electronic guitar, bass and drums to infuse Celtic musical elements into punk rock. RIPR.E.M. The breakthrough hit \"Losing My Religion\" showcased Peter Buck's Mandolin prowess, reaching No. On the Billboard Hot 100: 4, reaching No. on Rock and Alternative Charts - 1 Artists like Luther Dickinson, System of A Down, Green Day and the Decemberists have also embraced the instrument, demonstrating its versatility across genres from rock to pop punk. Notable examples include Black Crowes' \"Locust Street\", Green Day's Warning album and The Decemberists' signature sound. Even established bands like Dave Matthews Band and Heart have integrated mandolin, Boyd Tinsley has since used an electric mandolin and Nancy Wilson has played the instrument in songs like \"Dream of the Archer\" and the Led Zeppelin Coverage \"The Battle of Evermore\". The performance of Maria McKee's \"Show Me Heaven\" shows the potential of the mandolin to transcend musical categories, proving its adaptability in contemporary music.",
        "In 1951, President Truman again urged Eisenhower to run as a Democrat for President, reflecting a widespread desire for his candidacy. But Eisenhower had echoed his disagreements with the Democratic Party and declared himself and his family Republicans. A \"Draft Eisenhower\" movement within the Republican Party persuaded him to enter the 1952 presidential race, primarily to counter the non-interventionist Senator Robert A. Taft. After a prolonged debate during which Eisenhower was convinced of his civic duty and public mandate, he resigned his NATO command in June 1952 to begin a full-time campaign. With critical support from Texas, he defeated Taft for the nomination. His campaign, characterized by the memorable slogan \"I Like Ike\", strategically positioned him against Roosevelt's Yalta policies and Truman's approaches in Korea and China. To appease the left-wing old guard of the Republican Party, Eisenhower Richard M. Nixon was selected as his running mate, who also brought a strong anti-communist stance and youthful energy to balance Eisenhower's more seasoned profile.",
        "In 2006, Morgan Stanley purchased 20 acres north of the Showboat Atlantic City Hotel and Casino, creating a $2 billion casino resort. Revel Entertainment Group was contracted to bring this ambitious project to life. The dream quickly unraveled however, when Morgan Stanley, which owns 90% of the Revel Entertainment Group, abruptly halted funding in April 2010 and put the stake up for sale. Despite attempts to sweeten the deal with tax incentives by the New Jersey Legislature, the public remained skeptical, with a Fairleigh Dickinson University poll showing that 60 % of voters opposed the legislation. Chris Christie threw a lifeline in it - ending with $261 million in state tax credits. Revel had completed its exterior in March 2011 and was moving forward with interior work. A soft opening in April 2012 was followed by full operations in May. However, the triumph was short-lived. Just ten months later Revel filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, facing serious financial losses and a staggering write-down from $2.4 billion to $450 million. Despite restructuring attempts the resort did not escape its financial quagmire, reentering bankruptcy in June 2014 and eventually closing its doors in September, a stark testament to its turbulent journey.",
        "Self-esteem emerges as the deepest and most complex facet of identity formation, presenting an intimate landscape of personal worth and psychological resilience. Fundamentally driven by an innate human desire to validate and protect one's sense of self, self-esteem transcends simple surface assessment and delves into the complex emotional terrain of personal validation. Contrary to widespread assumptions, adolescent self-esteem exhibits remarkable stability with momentary fluctuations\u2014and also refers to as the \"barometric self-esteem\"\u2014creating temporary emotional turbulence without fundamentally altering the core psychological foundation. Gender dynamics affect significantly this complex emotional ecosystem: Girls anchor their self-worth predominantly through nurturing, supportive relationships, finding profound emotional sustenance in genuine connections, while boys tend to gain validation through assertiveness and perceived social influence. Romantic experiences affect both genders profoundly, with relationship dynamics serving as potent emotional crucibles that can dramatically redefine self-perception. The aftermath of romantic disruption reveals stark psychological vulnerabilities, with women facing elevated depression risks and men facing significantly elevated suicide potentials, underscoring the deeply interconnected nature of emotional well-being and self-worth.",
        "The Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) was released in North America through a series of progressively introduced bundles. The Deluxe Set, priced at US$199.99 (equivalent to $475 in 2016) was R.O.B., an NES Zapper light gun, two controllers and two game maps: yorochite and duck hunts. The Basic set was initially priced for US$89.99 without a game, and later for US$99.99 with \"Super Mario Bros.\" In 1988, the action set, retailing for US$149.99, included the control deck, two game controllers, an NES Zapper and a dual game pak featuring Super Mario Bros. and Duck Hunt. The 1989 Power Set included the console, two game controllers, an NES Zapper, a Power Pad and a Triple Game Pak with Super Mario Bros., Duck Hunt and World Class Track Meet. The Sports Set Bundle featured the console in 1990, an NES Satellite Infrared Wireless Multitape Adapter, four Game controllers and a Dual Game Pak with Super Spike V'Ball and Nintendo World Cup. Subsequently two additional bundle packages were released using the original NES console model. The 1992 Challenge set included the console, two controllers and a Super Mario Bros. 3 Game Pak for a retail price of $ 89.99. The repackaged basic set released in 1987 was priced at US$89.99 and contained only the console, two controllers and the official Nintendo player's guide, which included comprehensive information on all NES games available at the time.",
        "In this period, the Liberal Party faced internal divisions with former Treasurer John Howard and former Foreign Minister Andrew Peacock competing for leadership. Against the backdrop of the early 1990s recession, unemployment in 1992 reached 11.4%. Under the leadership of Dr John Hewson, the opposition launched the 650-page Fightback! In November 1991, the Policy Document proposed significant economic reforms. These included introducing a Goods and Services Tax (GST), restructuring Medicare, modifying unemployment benefits, reforming industrial relations, implementing tax cuts, reducing government spending, removing state payroll taxes and privatizing government enterprises. The 15 percent GST was the policy's centerpiece, representing a departure from previous economic approaches. Prime Minister Paul Keating campaigned against the Fightback Package, especially by criticizing the GST as disproportionately affecting working-class citizens by shifting the tax burden from direct to indirect. The pressure of public opinion led Hewson to exempt food from the proposed GST, which created complexity in the definition of taxable items. Hewson's struggle to explain these nuances was led by the infamous \"birthday cake interview,\" which some consider a pivotal moment in the electoral campaign. Keating ultimately won the third consecutive labor term in the 1993 election. Subsequently, various proposals were partially implemented during the government of Keating Labor and more extensively during the Howard Liberal government, with GST being the most notable example.",
        "Constantius, fueled by his ruthless ambitions, brutally ordered Liberius into exile in 356, giving him a mere three days to comply. He banished Liberius to Beroea in Thrace and cynically strove to sway him with expensive presents of five hundred gold pieces, \"to bear his charges\". But Liberius refused bribe steadfastly and vowed to the messenger to give gold to his flatterers and to challenge him to believe in Christ rather than persecute the Church of God. When attempts were made to leave the presents in the church, Liberius threw them out defiantly. Constantius summoned Liberius under strict guard in Milan only to be bravely told that Athanasius had been acquitted of sardica and his enemies were exposed as calumniators and impostors. Though the Emperor was silenced, his impatience boiled over and he ordered Liberius into exile. Two years later, when Constantius visited Rome to celebrate his twentieth reign, the ladies petitioned for Liberius to return to Rome. He agreed, forcing Liberius to subscribe to the Arian creed\u2014but Liberius had returned its see no sooner than he declared himself for the Nicene creed. Arian to his core, Constantius became his sole ruler at his brother's death in 350, manipulating faith to serve his political agenda.",
        "In the raw embrace of the Montana Territory, born April 26, 1864, education took root like wildflowers in untamed soil. Before official boundaries were drawn, schools sprouted in humble homes with eager minds welcomed teachers. In 1862, Fort Owen in Bitterroot Valley whispered the first lessons, its classroom filled with Indian children and frontier offspring. Ivy Robinson's winter term flickered briefly, which ended on the last breath of February. In Virginia City, Thomas Dimsdale charged the subscription school $1.75 per week, a golden ticket to knowledge. When the Territorial Legislative Assembly first convened, they planted seeds of public learning, allowing counties to stimulate education through taxation. Madison County first bloomed, the school founded in 1886 at Virginia City Sarah Raymond, a 25-year-old pioneer who traveled by wagon train, became its soul and heart. She was certified by a home-based exam and six dollars of gold dust and passed 50 to 60 students with Mrs. Farley and earned $125 a month. Without formal textbooks, they learned from the treasured volumes of emigrants, creating a tapestry of frontier knowledge that would shape generations to come.",
        "On June 20, 1794, Burke received a vote of thanks from the Commons for his service in Hastings Trial and immediately resigned from his seat, which was succeeded by his son Richard. A profound personal tragedy struck Burke with the loss of Richard in August 1794, to whom he was deeply attached and in whom he perceived potential that others did not recognize. King George III, who had favored Burke for his stance on the French Revolution, planned to create him as Earl of Beaconsfield, but his son's death stifled such an honor. Burke finally accepted a pension of \u00a32,500 which was vehemently challenged by the Duke of Bedford and Earl of Lauderdale. In his response, the letter to a Noble Lord (1796), Burke reiterated his merit, declaring:  At this time it cannot be repeated too often, line upon line; precept upon precept; until it comes into the currency of a proverb : innovate is not to reform \u00bb. He contrasted his reward, granted by \"a mild and generous sovereign,\" with the Duke of Bedford's inherited privileges and alluded subtly to the potential consequences of revolutionary ideas, while articulating a nuanced defense of the British constitutional system.",
        "The nation quickly descended into a brutal civil war with various factions fighting alongside deeply rooted clan loyalties. Over 500,000 residents fled, driven by persecution, grinding poverty and the lure of economic opportunities in the West and former Soviet republics. In 1992, Emomali Rahmon seized power by defeating Abdumalik Abdullajanov in a Presidential election, winning 58% of the votes under a landscape of complete devastation. The human toll of the conflict was staggering : over 100,000 dead and 1.2 million people had been moved both internally and internationally. A pivotal moment came in 1997 when a UN-mediated ceasefire was brokered to guarantee the opposition 30% of ministerial positions. Following elections in 1999 and 2006, Rahmon consolidated his power and won 98% and 79% of the vote, respectively, despite wide criticism from opposition parties and international observers. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe has repeatedly condemned Rahmon's regime for media censorship and political repression, highlighting systematic efforts to suppress independent journalism through website blocking and strategic tax inspections that effectively silenced critical voices.",
        "Yale's prominence in national elections since the Vietnam War comes from a rich tapestry of intellectual activism, institutional vision and transformative leadership. The university's commitment to cultivating future leaders, championed by Presidents Alfred Whitney Griswold and Kingman Brewster, created a fertile soil for political engagement. Reverend William Sloane Coffin's profound influence and the vibrant activist spirit on campus fed a generation of politically informed students. Yale has consistently produced influential political figures like John Kerry, George Pataki and Joseph Lieberman with its distinctive philosophy characterized by a deep sense of community, volunteerism and networked connections. The institution's deliberate admission strategy that emphasizes civic orientation and collaborative leadership systematically prepared students for public service. This unique culture, blending intellectual rigor with social responsibility, has enabled Yale alumni to transcend their individual ambitions and to contribute meaningfully to the national political discourse, reflecting the university's enduring commitment to developing leaders who prioritize collective progress over personal advancement.",
        "During King George V's reign the Buckingham Palace underwent significant architectural transformation. Sir Aston Webb's redesign of the East Front in 1913, crafted of Portland stone, created an elegant backdrop for the Victoria Memorial. The more serious demeanor of the monarch changed royal protocols, focusing on official duties over extravagant social events. His patronage of emerging musical genres was notably progressive and hosted groundbreaking jazz performances by pioneering musicians like the Original Dixieland Jazz Band and Louis Armstrong. Queen Mary complemented this cultural evolution by lovingly preserving and extending the Royal Collections artistic collections. Her keen eye for design was evident in her careful selections such as the Empire-style marble chimneypieces in the Bow Room and her thoughtful restoration of the Blue Drawing Room, a magnificent 69-foot space featuring Nash's intricately coffered ceiling with ornate gilt console brackets. Their combined efforts transformed Buckingham Palace into a dynamic symbol of British royal sophistication in the early 20th century.",
        "The departures of Nez and van Gaal paled in importance compared to the seismic shift caused by Lus Figo's betrayal. Figo, a cult hero deeply embraced by Catalans, shattered hearts when he consigned with the arch-rivals Real Madrid. His subsequent return to Camp Nou was marked with visceral animosity, with fans throwing a piglet's head and a whiskey bottle in symbolic expression of their rage. The subsequent years witnessed the plunge into the crisis of Barcelona, with managers cycling around as a perilous shadow. Lloren\u00e7 Serra Ferrer's expensive summer recruiting exhibited only mediocrity, culminating in a humiliating Champions League elimination. Carles Rexach's interim leadership stabilized the ship by a marginal margin, securing a final Champions League spot through pure determination. Louis van Gaal returned with some hope but quickly dissolved into one of the club\u2019s most miserable La Liga campaigns, with the team falling to 15th place by February 2003. Radomir Anti's short tenure could not reverse the club's fortunes and Joan Gaspart's presidency fell under the weight of sustained failure and ultimately resigned in a landscape of profound disappointment and fractured dreams."
