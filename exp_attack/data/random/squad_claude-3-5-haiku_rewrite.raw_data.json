        "In 1954, major Serbian and Croatian writers, linguists and literary critics, backed by Matica srpska and Matica hrvatska signed the Novi Sad Agreement, which in its first conclusion stated: \"Serbs, Croats and Montenegrins share a single language with two equal variants that have developed around Zagreb (western) and Belgrade (eastern)\". The agreement insisted on the equal status of Cyrillic and Latin scripts, and of Ekavian and Ijekavian pronunciations. It also specified that Serbo-Croatian should be the name of the language in official contexts, while in unofficial use the traditional Serbian and Croatian were to be retained. Matica hrvatska and Matica srpska were to work together on a dictionary, and a committee of Serbian and Croatian linguists was asked to prepare a pravopis. During the sixties both books were published simultaneously in Ijekavian Latin in Zagreb and Ekavian Cyrillic in Novi Sad. Yet Croatian linguists claim that it was an act of unitarianism. The evidence supporting this claim is patchy: Croatian linguist Stjepan Babi\u0107 complained that the television transmission from Belgrade always used the Latin alphabet\u2014 which was true, but was not proof of unequal rights, but of frequency of use and prestige. Babi\u0107 further complained that the Novi Sad Dictionary (1967) listed side by side words from both the Croatian and Serbian variants wherever they differed, which one can view as proof of careful respect for both variants, and not of unitarism. Moreover, Croatian linguists criticized those parts of the Dictionary for being unitaristic that were written by Croatian linguists. And finally, Croatian linguists ignored the fact that the material for the Pravopisni rje\u010dnik came",
        "The Bush administration then turned its attention to Iraq, and argued the need to remove Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq had become urgent. Among the stated reasons were that Saddam's regime had tried to acquire nuclear material and had not properly accounted for biological and chemical material it was known to have previously possessed, and believed to still maintain. Both the possession of these weapons of mass destruction (WMD), and the failure to account for them, would violate the U.N. sanctions. The assertion about WMD was hotly advanced by the Bush administration from the beginning, but other major powers including China, France, Germany, and Russia remained unconvinced that Iraq was a threat and refused to allow passage of a UN Security Council resolution to authorize the use of force. Iraq permitted UN weapon inspectors in November 2002, who were continuing their work to assess the WMD claim when the Bush administration decided to proceed with war without UN authorization and told the inspectors to leave the country. The United States invaded Iraq on March 20, 2003, along with a \"coalition of the willing\" that consisted of additional troops from the United Kingdom, and to a lesser extent, from Australia and Poland. Within about three weeks, the invasion caused the collapse of both the Iraqi government and its armed forces, however, the U.S. and allied forces failed to find any weapon of mass destruction in Iraq. Traces of former materials and weapons labs were reported to have been located, but",
        "An adolescent's environment plays a huge role in their identity development. While most adolescent studies are conducted on white, middle class children, studies show that the more privileged upbringing people have, the more successfully they develop their identity. The forming of an adolescent's identity is a crucial time in their life. It has been recently found that demographic patterns suggest that the transition to adulthood is now occurring over a longer span of years than was the case during the middle of the 20th century. Accordingly, youth, a period that spans late adolescence and early adulthood, has become a more prominent stage of the life course. This therefore has caused various factors to become important during this development. So many factors contribute to the developing social identity of an adolescent from commitment, to coping devices, to social media. All of these factors are affected by the environment an adolescent grows up in. A child from a more privileged upbringing is exposed to more opportunities",
        "Compared to other team sports, the National Football League preseason is very structured. Every NFL team plays exactly four pre-season exhibition games a year, two at home and two away, with the exception of two teams each year who play a fifth game, the Pro Football Hall of Fame Game. These exhibition games, most of which are held in the month of August, are played for the purpose of helping coaches narrow down the roster from the offseason limit of 90 players to the regular-season limit of 53 players. While the scheduling formula is not as rigid for preseason games as they are for the regular season, there are numerous restrictions and traditions that limit the choices of preseason opponents; teams are also restricted on what days and times they can play these games. Split-squad games, a practice common in baseball and hockey, where a team that is scheduled to play two games on the same day splits their team into two squads, are prohibited. The NFL has played exhibition games in Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia (including the American Bowl in 1999) and Mexico to spread the league's popularity (a game of this type was proposed for China but, due to financial and logistical problems, was eventually",
        "In practice, not all rule violations will result in a disqualification as the referee may use their own judgement and is not obligated to stop the match. Usually, the only offenses that the referee will see and immediately disqualify the match on (as opposed to having multiple offenses) are low blows, weapon usage, interference, or assaulting the referee. In WWE, a referee must see the violation with their own eyes to rule that the match end in a disqualification (simply watching the video tape is not usually enough) and the referee's ruling is almost always final, although Dusty finishes (named after, and made famous by, Dusty Rhodes) will often result in the referee's decision being overturned. It is not uncommon for the referees themselves to get knocked out during a match, which is commonly referred to by the term \"ref bump\". While the referee remains \"unconscious\", wrestlers are free to violate rules until the referee is revived or replaced. In some cases, a referee might disqualify a person under the presumption that it was that wrestler who knocked them out; most referee knockouts are arranged to allow a wrestler, usually a heel, to gain an advantage. For example, a",
        "In the 15th century the dome was added and the naves extended back of the choir, uniting the building to the tower and forming a main entrance. Archbishop Luis Alfonso de los Cameros began the building of the main chapel in 1674; the walls were decorated with marbles and bronzes in the Baroque style of that period. At the beginning of the 18th century the German Conrad Rudolphus built the fa\u00e7ade of the main entrance. The other two doors lead into the transept; one, that of the Apostles in pure pointed Gothic, dates from the 14th century, the other is that of the Pal\u00e1u. The additions made to the back of the cathedral detract from its height. The 18th-century restoration rounded the pointed arches, covered the Gothic columns with Corinthian pillars, and redecorated the walls. The dome has no lantern, its plain ceiling being pierced by two large side windows. There are four chapels on either side, besides that at the end and those that open into the choir, the transept, and the sanctuary. It contains many paintings by eminent artists. A silver reredos, which was behind the altar, was carried away in the war of 1808, and converted into coin to meet the expenses of the campaign. There are two paintings by Francisco Goya in the San Francesco chapel. Behind the Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament is a small Renaissance chapel built by Calixtus III. Beside the cathedral is",
        "Early reviews were mixed in their assessment. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly considered that \"As TV, American Idol is crazily entertaining; as music, it's dust-mote inconsequential\". Others, however, thought that \"the most striking aspect of the series was the genuine talent it revealed\". It was also described as a \"sadistic musical bake-off\", and \"a romp in humiliation\". Other aspects of the show have attracted criticisms. The product placement in the show in particular was noted, and some critics were harsh about what they perceived as its blatant commercial calculations \u2013 Karla Peterson of The San Diego Union-Tribune charged that American Idol is \"a conniving multimedia monster\" that has \"absorbed the sin of our debauched culture and spit them out in a lump of reconstituted evil\".

        "Intense media interest in the opinions and private lives of the royal family during the 1980s led to a series of sensational stories in the press, not all of which were entirely true. As Kelvin MacKenzie, editor of The Sun, told his staff: \"Give me a Sunday for Monday splash on the Royals. Don't worry if it's not true\u2014so long as there's not too much of a fuss about it afterwards.\" Newspaper editor Donald Trelford wrote in The Observer of 21 September 1986: \"The royal soap opera has now reached such a pitch of public interest that the boundary between fact and fiction has been lost sight of ... it is not just that some papers don't check their facts or accept denials: they don't care if the stories are true or not.\" It was reported, most notably in The Sunday Times of 20 July 1986, that the Queen was worried that Margaret Thatcher's economic policies fostered social divisions and was alarmed by high unemployment, a series of riots, the violence of a miners' strike, and Thatcher's refusal to apply sanctions against the apartheid regime in South Africa. The sources of the rumours included royal aide Michael Shea and Commonwealth Secretary-General Shridath Ramphal, but",

        "To extend and consolidate the dynasty's control in Central Asia, the Kangxi Emperor personally led a series of military campaigns against the Dzungars in Outer Mongolia. The Kangxi Emperor was able to successfully expel Galdan's invading forces from these regions, which were then incorporated into the empire. Galdan was eventually killed in the Dzungar\u2013Qing War. In 1683, Qing forces received the surrender of Taiwan from Zheng Keshuang, grandson of Koxinga, who had conquered Taiwan from the Dutch colonists as a base against the Qing. Zheng Keshuang was awarded the title \"Duke Haicheng\" (\u6d77\u6f84\u516c) and was inducted into the Han Chinese Plain Red Banner of the Eight Banners when he moved to Beijing. Several Ming princes had accompanied Koxinga to Taiwan in 1661-1662, including the Prince of Ningjing Zhu Shugui and Prince Zhu Honghuan (\u6731\u5f18\u6853), son of Zhu Yihai, where they lived in the Kingdom of Tungning. The Qing sent the 17 Ming princes still living on Taiwan in 1683 back to mainland China where they spent the rest of their lives in exile since their lives were spared from execution. Winning Taiwan freed Kangxi's forces for series of battles over Albazin, the far eastern outpost of the Tsardom of Russia. Zheng's former soldiers on Taiwan like the rattan shield troops were also inducted into the Eight Banners and used by the Qing against Russian Cossacks at Albazin. The 1689 Treaty",

In this field researchers often concentrate on how particular phenomena relate to matters of ideology, nationality, ethnicity, social class, and/or gender.[citation needed] Cultural studies has a concern with the meaning and practices of everyday life. These practices comprise the ways people do particular things (such as watching television, or eating out) in a given culture.

        "Libya's economy witnessed increasing privatization; although rejecting the socialist policies of nationalized industry advocated in The Green Book, government figures asserted that they were forging \"people's socialism\" rather than capitalism. Gaddafi welcomed these reforms, calling for wide-scale privatization in a March 2003 speech. In 2003, the oil industry was largely sold to private corporations, and by 2004, there was $40 billion of direct foreign investment in Libya, a sixfold rise over 2003. Sectors of Libya's population reacted against these reforms with public demonstrations, and in March 2006, revolutionary hard-liners took control of the GPC cabinet; although scaling back the pace of the changes, they did not halt them. In 2010, plans were announced that would have seen half the Libyan economy privatized over the following decade. While there was no accompanying political liberalization, with Gaddafi retaining predominant control, in March 2010, the government devolved further powers to the municipal councils. Rising numbers of reformist technocrats attained positions in the country's governance; best known was Gaddafi's son and heir apparent Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, who was openly critical of Libya's human rights record. He led a group who proposed the drafting of the new constitution, although it was never adopted, and in October 2009 was appointed to head the PSLC. Involved in encouraging",
        "Mammalian hair, also known as pelage, can vary in color between populations, organisms within a population, and even on the individual organism. Light-dark color variation is common in the mammalian taxa. Sometimes, this color variation is determined by age variation, however, in other cases, it is determined by other factors. Selective pressures, such as ecological interactions with other populations or environmental conditions, often lead to the variation in mammalian coloration. These selective pressures favor certain colors in order to increase survival. Camouflage is thought to be a major selection pressure shaping coloration in mammals, although there is also evidence that sexual selection, communication, and physiological processes may influence the evolution of coloration as well. Camouflage is the most predominant mechanism for color variation, as it aids in the concealment of the organisms from predators or from their prey. Coat color can also be for intraspecies communication such as warning members of their species about predators, indicating health for reproductive purposes, communicating between mother and young, and intimidating predators. Studies have shown that in some cases, differences in female and male coat color could indicate information nutrition and hormone levels, which are important in",
        "But in the mid-18th century, during the French Enlightenment, a more ideological use of the term had come into use. In 1765, the author of an anonymous article in a French Enlightenment periodical spoke of \"The general love of humanity ... a virtue hitherto quite nameless among us, and which we will venture to call 'humanism', for the time has come to create a word for such a beautiful and necessary thing\". The latter part of the 18th and the early 19th centuries saw the creation of numerous grass-roots \"philanthropic\" and benevolent societies dedicated to human betterment and the spreading of knowledge (some Christian, some not). After the French Revolution, the idea that human virtue could be created by human reason alone independently from traditional religious institutions, attributed by opponents of the Revolution to Enlightenment philosophes such as Rousseau, was violently attacked by influential religious and political conservatives, such as Edmund Burke and Joseph de Maistre, as a deification or idolatry of humanity. Humanism began to acquire a negative sense. The Oxford English Dictionary records the use of the word \"humanism\" by an English clergyman in 1812 to indicate those who believe in the \"mere humanity\" (as opposed to the divine nature) of Christ, i.e., Unitarians and Deists.

        "More commonly, in cases where there are three or more parties, no one party is likely to gain power alone, and parties work with each other to form coalition governments. This has been an emerging trend in the politics of the Republic of Ireland since the 1980s and is almost always the case in Germany on national and state level, and in most constituencies at the communal level. Furthermore, since the forming of the Republic of Iceland there has never been a government not led by a coalition (usually of the Independence Party and one other (often the Social Democratic Alliance). A similar situation exists in the Republic of Ireland; since 1989, no one party has held power on its own. Since then, numerous coalition governments have been formed. These coalitions have been exclusively led by one of either Fianna F\u00e1il or Fine Gael.

        "Emotions can motivate social interactions and relationships and therefore are directly related with basic physiology, particularly with the stress systems. This is important because emotions are related to the anti-stress complex, with an oxytocin-attachment system, which plays a major role in bonding. Emotional phenotype temperaments affect social connectedness and fitness in complex social systems (Kurt Kortschal 2013). These characteristics are shared with other species and taxa and are due to the effects of genes and their continuous transmission. Information that is encoded in the DNA sequences provides the blueprint for assembling proteins that make up our cells. Zygotes require genetic information from their parental germ cells, and at every speciation event, heritable traits that have enabled its ancestor to survive and reproduce successfully are passed down along with new traits that could be potentially beneficial to the offspring. In the five million years since the linages leading to modern humans and chimpanzees split, only about 1.2% of their genetic material has been modified. This suggests that everything that separates us from chimpanzees must be encoded in that very small amount of DNA, including our behaviors. Students that study animal behaviors have only identified intraspecific examples of gene-dependent behavioral phenotypes. In voles (Microtus spp.) minor genetic differences have been identified in a vasopressin receptor gene that corresponds to",
        "The implications are multiple as various research traditions are now[when?] heavily utilizing the lens of identity to examine phenomena.[citation needed] One implication of identity and of identity construction can be seen in occupational settings. This becomes increasing challenging in stigmatized jobs or \"dirty work\" (Hughes, 1951). Tracy and Trethewey (2005) state that \"individuals gravitate toward and turn away from particular jobs depending in part, on the extent to which they validate a \"preferred organizational self\" (Tracy & Tretheway 2005, p. 169).

        "Jeffrey Long and Rick Kittles give a long critique of the application of FST to human populations in their 2003 paper \"Human Genetic Diversity and the Nonexistence of Biological Races\". They find that the figure of 85% is misleading because it implies that all human populations contain on average 85% of all genetic diversity. They claim that this does not correctly reflect human population history, because it treats all human groups as independent. A more realistic portrayal of the way human groups are related is to understand that some human groups are parental to other groups and that these groups represent paraphyletic groups to their descent groups. For example, under the recent African origin theory the human population in Africa is paraphyletic to all other human groups because it represents the ancestral group from which all non-African populations derive, but more than that, non-African groups only derive from a small non-representative sample of this African population. This means that all non-African groups are more closely related to each other and to some African groups (probably east Africans) than they are to others, and further that the migration out of Africa represented a genetic bottleneck, with much of the diversity that existed in Africa not being carried out of Africa by the emigrating groups. This view produces a version of",
        "The book was widely translated in Darwin's lifetime, but problems arose with translating concepts and metaphors, and some translations were biased by the translator's own agenda. Darwin distributed presentation copies in France and Germany, hoping that suitable applicants would come forward, as translators were expected to make their own arrangements with a local publisher. He welcomed the distinguished elderly naturalist and geologist Heinrich Georg Bronn, but the German translation published in 1860 imposed Bronn's own ideas, adding controversial themes that Darwin had deliberately omitted. Bronn translated \"favoured races\" as \"perfected races\", and added essays on issues including the origin of life, as well as a final chapter on religious implications partly inspired by Bronn's adherence to Naturphilosophie. In 1862, Bronn produced a second edition based on the third English edition and Darwin's suggested additions, but then died of a heart attack. Darwin corresponded closely with Julius Victor Carus, who published an improved translation in 1867. Darwin's attempts to find a translator in France fell through, and the translation by Cl\u00e9mence Royer published in 1862 added an introduction praising Darwin's ideas as an alternative to religious revelation and promoting ideas anticipating social Darwinism and eugenics,",
        "Hegel certainly intends to preserve what he takes to be true of German idealism, in particular Kant's insistence that ethical reason can and does go beyond finite inclinations. For Hegel there must be some identity of thought and being for the \"subject\" (any human observer)) to be able to know any observed \"object\" (any external entity, possibly even another human) at all. Under Hegel's concept of \"subject-object identity,\" subject and object both have Spirit (Hegel's ersatz, redefined, nonsupernatural \"God\") as their conceptual (not metaphysical) inner reality\u2014and in that sense are identical. But until Spirit's \"self-realization\" occurs and Spirit graduates from Spirit to Absolute Spirit status, subject (a human mind) mistakenly thinks every \"object\" it observes is something \"alien,\" meaning something separate or apart from \"subject.\" In Hegel's words, \"The object is revealed to it [to \"subject\"] by [as] something alien, and it does not recognize itself.\" Self-realization occurs when Hegel (part of Spirit's nonsupernatural Mind, which is the collective mind of all humans) arrives on the scene and realizes that every \"object\" is himself, because both subject and",

The date of the assignment was retroactively established on Armistice Day. It is doubtful whether a referendum in Strasbourg would have ended in France's favour since the political parties striving for an autonomous Alsace or a connection to France accounted only for a small proportion of votes in the last Reichstag as well as in the local elections. The Alsatian autonomists who were pro French had won many votes in the more rural parts of the region and other towns since the annexation of the region by Germany in 1871. The movement started with the first election for the Reichstag; those elected were called \"les d\u00e9put\u00e9s protestataires\", and until the fall of Bismarck in 1890, they were the only deputies elected by the Alsatians to the German parliament demanding the return of those territories to France.

        "Zhejiang's main manufacturing sectors are electromechanical industries, textiles, chemical industries, food, and construction materials. In recent years Zhejiang has followed its own development model, dubbed the \"Zhejiang model\", which is based on prioritizing and encouraging entrepreneurship, an emphasis on small businesses responsive to the whims of the market, large public investments into infrastructure, and the production of low-cost goods in bulk for both domestic consumption and export. As a result, Zhejiang has made itself one of the richest provinces, and the \"Zhejiang spirit\" has become something of a legend within China. However, some economists now worry that this model is not sustainable, in that it is inefficient and places unreasonable demands on raw materials and public utilities, and also a dead end, in that the myriad small businesses in Zhejiang producing cheap goods in bulk are unable to move to more sophisticated or technologically more advanced industries. The economic heart of Zhejiang is moving from North Zhejiang, centered on Hangzhou, southeastward to the region centered on Wenzhou and Taizhou. The per capita disposable income of urbanites in Zhejiang reached 24,611 yuan (US$3,603) in 2009, an annual real growth of 8.3%.

Some of them added their own names to the disc jacket to signify that the movie was not owned by MCA. After Discovision Associates shut down in early 1982, Universal Studio's videodisc software label, called MCA Videodisc until 1984, began reissuing many DiscoVision titles. Unfortunately, quite a few, such as Battlestar Galactica and Jaws, were time-compressed versions of their CAV or CLV Disco Vision originals.

Anthropomorphic figurines have been found in the Balkans from 6000 BC, and in Central Europe by c. 5800 BC (La Hoguette). Among the earliest cultural complexes of this area are the Sesklo culture in Thessaly, which later expanded in the Balkans giving rise to Star\u010devo-K\u00f6r\u00f6s (Cris), Linearbandkeramik, and Vin\u010da. Through a combination of cultural diffusion and migration of peoples, the Neolithic traditions spread west and northwards to reach northwestern Europe by around 4500 BC. The Vin\u010da culture may have created the earliest system of writing, the Vin\u010da signs, though archaeologist Shan Winn believes they most likely represented pictograms and ideograms rather than a truly developed form of writing. The Cucuteni-Trypillian culture built enormous settlements in Romania, Moldova and Ukraine from 5300 to 2300 BC.

        "Knowledge, for Popper, was objective, both in the sense that it is objectively true (or truthlike), and also in the sense that knowledge has an ontological status (i.e., knowledge as object) independent of the knowing subject (Objective Knowledge: An Evolutionary Approach, 1972). He proposed three worlds: World One, being the physical world, or physical states; World Two, being the world of mind, or mental states, ideas, and perceptions; and World Three, being the body of human knowledge expressed in its manifold forms, or the products of the second world made manifest in the materials of the first world (i.e., books, papers, paintings, symphonies, and all the products of the human mind). World Three, he argued, was the product of individual human beings in exactly the same sense that an animal path is the product of individual animals, and that, as such, has an existence and evolution independent of any individual knowing subjects. The influence of World Three, in his view, on the individual human mind (World Two) is at least as strong as the influence of World One. In other words, the knowledge held by a given",
        "Strict separation of powers did not operate in The United Kingdom, the political structure of which served in most instances[citation needed] as a model for the government created by the U.S. Constitution.[citation needed] Under the UK Westminster system, based on parliamentary sovereignty and responsible government, Parliament (consisting of the Sovereign (King-in-Parliament), House of Lords and House of Commons) was the supreme lawmaking authority. The executive branch acted in the name of the King (\"His Majesty's Government\"), as did the judiciary. The King's Ministers were in most cases members of one of the two Houses of Parliament, and the Government needed to sustain the support of a majority in the House of Commons. One minister, the Lord Chancellor, was at the same time the sole judge in the Court of Chancery and the presiding officer in the House of Lords. Therefore, it may be seen that the three branches of British government often violated the strict principle of separation of powers, even though there were many occasions when the different branches of the government disagreed with each other. Some U.S. states did not observe a strict separation of powers in",
        "Although Ottoman madaris had a number of different branches of study, such as calligraphic sciences, oral sciences, and intellectual sciences, they primarily served the function of an Islamic centre for spiritual learning. \"The goal of all knowledge and in particular, of the spiritual sciences is knowledge of God.\" Religion, for the most part, determines the significance and importance of each science. As \u0130nalc\u0131k mentions: \"Those which aid religion are good and sciences like astrology are bad.\" However, even though mathematics, or studies in logic were part of the madrasa's curriculum, they were all centred around religion.

        "The landscapes of Thuringia are quite diverse. The far north is occupied by the Harz mountains, followed by the Goldene Aue, a fertile floodplain around Nordhausen with the Helme as most important river. The north-west includes the Eichsfeld, a hilly and sometimes forested region, where the Leine river emanates. The central and northern part of Thuringia is defined by the 3000 km\u00b2 wide Thuringian Basin, a very fertile and flat area around the Unstrut river and completely surrounded by the following hill chains (clockwise from the north-west): D\u00fcn, Hainleite, Windleite, Kyffh\u00e4user, Hohe Schrecke, Schm\u00fccke, Finne, Ettersberg, Steigerwald, Thuringian Forest, H\u00f6rselberge and Hainich. Within the Basin the smaller hill chains Fahner H\u00f6he and Heilinger H\u00f6hen. South of the Thuringian Basin is the Land's largest mountain range, marked by the Thuringian Forest in the north-west, the Thuringian Highland in the middle and the Franconian Forest in the south-east. Most of this range is forested and the Gro\u00dfer Beerberg (983 m) is Thuringia's highest mountain. To the south-west, the Forest is followed up by Werra river valley, dividing it from the Rh\u00f6n Mountains in the west and the Grabfeld plain in the south. Eastern Thuringia, commonly described as the area east of Saale and Loquitz valley, is marked by a hilly landscape, rising slowly from the flat north to the mountainous south.

        "Throughout the 14th century, French kings sought to expand their influence at the expense of the territorial holdings of the nobility. They ran into difficulties when attempting to confiscate the holdings of the English kings in southern France, leading to the Hundred Years' War, waged from 1337 to 1453. Early in the war the English under Edward III (r. 1327\u201377) and his son Edward, the Black Prince (d. 1376),[AF] won the battles of Cr\u00e9cy and Poitiers, captured the city of Calais, and won control of much of France.[AG] The resulting stresses almost caused the disintegration of the French kingdom during the early years of the war. In the early 15th century, France again came close to dissolving, but in the late 1420s the military successes of Joan of Arc (d. 1431) led to the victory of the French and the capture of the last English possessions in southern France in 1453. The price was high, as the population of France at the end of the Wars was likely half what it had been at the start of the conflict. Conversely, the Wars had a positive effect on English national identity, doing much to fuse the various local identities into a national English",

During the early Jurassic, the supercontinent Pangaea broke up into the northern supercontinent Laurasia and the southern supercontinent Gondwana; the Gulf of Mexico opened in the new rift between North America and what is now Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. The Jurassic North Atlantic Ocean was relatively narrow, while the South Atlantic did not open until the following Cretaceous Period, when Gondwana itself rifted apart. The Tethys Sea closed, and the Neotethys basin appeared. Climates were warm, with no evidence of glaciation. As in the Triassic, there was apparently no land near either pole, and no extensive ice caps existed. The Jurassic geological record is good in western Europe, where extensive marine sequences indicate a time when much of the continent was submerged under shallow tropical seas; famous locales include the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site and the renowned late Jurassic lagerst\u00e4tten of Holzmaden and Solnhofen. In contrast, the North American Jurassic record is the poorest of the Mesozoic, with few outcrops at the surface.

The Ottoman sultan, p\u00e2di\u015f\u00e2h or \"lord of kings\", served as the Empire's sole regent and was considered to be the embodiment of its government, though he did not always exercise complete control. The Imperial Harem was one of the most important powers of the Ottoman court. It was ruled by the Valide Sultan. On occasion, the Valide Sultan would become involved in state politics. For a time, the women of the Harem effectively controlled the state in what was termed the \"Sultanate of Women\". New sultans were always chosen from the sons of the previous sultan. The strong educational system of the palace school was geared towards eliminating the unfit potential heirs, and establishing support among the ruling elite for a successor. The palace schools, which would also educate the future administrators of the state, were not a single track. First, the Madrasa (Ottoman Turkish: Medrese\u200e) was designated for the Muslims, and educated scholars and state officials according to Islamic tradition.

Now able to use it to switch between both forms at will, Link is led by Midna to the Mirror of Twilight located deep within the Gerudo Desert, the only known gateway between the Twilight Realm and Hyrule. However, they discover that the mirror is broken. The Sages there explain that Zant tried to destroy it, but he was only able to shatter it into fragments; only the true ruler of the Twili can completely destroy the Mirror of Twilight. They also reveal that they used it a century ago to banish Ganondorf, the Gerudo leader who attempted to steal the Triforce, to the Twilight Realm when executing him failed. Assisted by an underground resistance group they meet in Castle Town, Link and Midna set out to retrieve the missing shards of the Mirror, defeating those they infected. Once the portal has been restored, Midna is revealed to be the true ruler of the Twilight Realm, usurped by Zant when he cursed her into her current form. Confronting Zant, Link and Midna learn that Zant's coup was made possible when he forged a pact with Ganondorf, who asked for Zant's assistance in conquering Hyrule. After Link defeats Zant,",

The Irish left the Big East for the ACC during a prolonged period of instability in the Big East; while they maintain their football independence, they have committed to play five games per season against ACC opponents. In ice hockey, the Irish were forced to find a new conference home after the Big Ten Conference's decision to add the sport in 2013\u201314 led to a cascade of conference moves that culminated in the dissolution of the school's former hockey home, the Central Collegiate Hockey Association, after the 2012\u201313 season.

Through the persuasion of Jeremiah Dummer, Yale, who had made a fortune through trade while living in Madras as a representative of the East India Company, donated nine bales of goods, which were sold for more than \u00a3560, a substantial sum at the time. Cotton Mather suggested that the school change its name to Yale College. Meanwhile, a Harvard graduate working in England convinced some 180 prominent intellectuals that they should donate books to Yale. The 1714 shipment of 500 books represented the best of modern English literature, science, philosophy and theology. It had a profound effect on intellectuals at Yale.

        "Despite efforts to revive Hebrew as the national language of the Jewish people, knowledge of the language is not commonly possessed by Jews worldwide and English has emerged as the lingua franca of the Jewish diaspora. Although many Jews once had sufficient knowledge of Hebrew to study the classic literature, and Jewish languages like Yiddish and Ladino were commonly used as recently as the early 20th century, most Jews lack such knowledge today and English has by and large superseded most Jewish vernaculars. The three most commonly spoken languages among Jews today are Hebrew, English, and Russian. Some Romance languages, particularly French and Spanish, are also widely used. Yiddish has been spoken by more Jews in history than any other language, but it is far less used today following the Holocaust and the adoption of Modern Hebrew by the Zionist movement and the State of Israel. In some places, the mother language of the Jewish community differs from that of the general population or the dominant group. For example, in Quebec, the Ashkenazic majority has adopted English, while the Sephardic minority uses French as its primary language. Similarly, South African Jews adopted English rather than Afrikaans. Due to both Czarist and Soviet policies, Russian has superseded Yiddish as the language of Russian Jews, but these policies have also affected neighboring communities. Today, Russian is the first language for",

Galicia was incorporated into the Roman Empire at the end of the Cantabrian Wars in 19 BC, being turned into a Roman province in the 3rd century AD. In 410, the Germanic Suebi established a kingdom with its capital in Braga (Portugal) which was incorporated into that of the Visigoths in 585. In 711, the Arabs invaded the Iberian Peninsula, taking the Visigoth kingdom, but soon in 740 Galicia was incorporated into the Christian kingdom of Asturias. During the Middle Ages, the kingdom of Galicia was occasionally ruled by its own kings, but most of the time it was leagued to the kingdom of Leon and later to that of Castile, while maintaining its own legal and customary practices and personality. From the 13th century on, the kings of Castile, as kings of Galicia, appointed an Adiantado-m\u00f3r, whose attributions passed to the Governor and Captain General of the Kingdom of Galiza from the last years of the 15th century.

        "Birds have a very efficient system for diffusing oxygen into the blood; birds have a ten times greater surface area to gas exchange volume than mammals. As a result, birds have more blood in their capillaries per unit of volume of lung than a mammal. The arteries are composed of thick elastic muscles to withstand the pressure of the ventricular constriction, and become more rigid as they move away from the heart. Blood moves through the arteries, which undergo vasoconstriction, and into arterioles which act as a transportation system to distribute primarily oxygen as well as nutrients to all tissues of the body. As the arterioles move away from the heart and into individual organs and tissues they are further divided to increase surface area and slow blood flow. Travelling through the arterioles blood moves into the capillaries where gas exchange can occur. Capillaries are organized into capillary beds in tissues, it is here that blood exchanges oxygen for carbon dioxide waste. In the capillary beds blood flow is slowed to allow maximum diffusion of oxygen into the tissues. Once the blood has become deoxygenated it travels through venules then veins and back to the heart. Veins, unlike arteries, are thin and rigid as they do not need to withstand extreme pressure. As blood travels through the venules to the veins a funneling occurs called vasodilation",

The College Dropout received near-universal critical acclaim from contemporary music critics, was voted the top album of the year by two major music publications, and has consistently been ranked among the great hip-hop works and debut albums by artists. \"Jesus Walks\", the album's fourth single, perhaps exposed West to a wider audience; the song's subject matter concerns faith and Christianity.

Nagumo executed a first strike against Midway, while Fletcher launched his aircraft, bound for Nagumo's carriers. At 09:20 the first U.S. carrier aircraft arrived, TBD Devastator torpedo bombers from Hornet, but their attacks were poorly coordinated and ineffectual; thanks in part to faulty aerial torpedoes, they failed to score a single hit and all 15 were wiped out by defending Zero fighters. At 09:35, 15 additional TBDs from Enterprise attacked in which 14 were lost, again with no hits. Thus far, Fletcher's attacks had been disorganized and seemingly ineffectual, but they succeeded in drawing Nagumo's defensive fighters down to sea level where they expended much of their fuel and ammunition repulsing the two waves of torpedo bombers. As a result, when U.S. dive bombers arrived at high altitude, the Zeros were poorly positioned to defend. To make matters worse, Nagumo's four carriers had drifted out of formation in their efforts to avoid torpedoes, reducing the concentration of their anti-aircraft fire. Nagumo's indecision had also created confusion aboard his carriers. Alerted to the need of a second strike on Midway, but also wary of the need to deal with the American carriers that he now",

He was forced to flee to Scandinavia in 976 after his half-brother Yaropolk had murdered his other brother Oleg and taken control of Rus. In Scandinavia, with the help of his relative Earl H\u00e5kon Sigurdsson, ruler of Norway, Vladimir assembled a Viking army and reconquered Novgorod and Kiev from Yaropolk. As Prince of Kiev, Vladimir's most notable achievement was the Christianization of Kievan Rus', a process that began in 988.

They visited the Christians of the Latin Rite, the Jews, and the Muslims before finally arriving in Constantinople. They rejected Islam because, among other things, it prohibited the consumption of alcohol, and Judaism because the god of the Jews had permitted his chosen people to be deprived of their country.

        "Identity development is a stage in the adolescent life cycle. For most, the search for identity begins in the adolescent years. During these years, adolescents are more open to 'trying on' different behaviours and appearances to discover who they are. In other words, in an attempt to find their identity and discover who they are adolescents are liking to cycle through a number of identities to find one that suits them best. But, developing and maintaining identity (in adolescent years) is a difficult task due to multiple factors such as family life, environment, and social status. Empirical studies suggest that this process might be more accurately described as identity development, rather than formation, but confirms a normative process of change in both content and structure of one's thoughts about the self. The two main aspects of identity development are self-clarity and self-esteem. Since choices made during adolescent years can influence later life, high levels of self-awareness and self-control during mid-adolescence will lead to better decisions during the transition to adulthood.[citation needed] Researchers have used three general approaches to understanding identity development: self-concept, sense of identity, and self-esteem. The years of adolescence create a more conscientious group of young adults. Adolescents pay close attention and give more time and effort to their appearance as their body goes through changes. Unlike children, teens put forth",

His successor as bishop of Alexandria, Alexander of Alexandria (312\u2013328) was an Origenist as well as a documented mentor of Athanasius. According to Sozomen, Bishop Alexander \"invited Athanasius to be his commensal and secretary. He had been well educated, and was versed in grammar and rhetoric, and had already, while still a young man, and before reaching the episcopate, given proof to those who dwelt with him of his wisdom and acumen\".

        "Egocentrism in adolescents forms a self-conscious desire to feel important in their peer groups and enjoy social acceptance. Unlike the conflicting aspects of self-concept, identity represents a coherent sense of self stable across circumstances and including past experiences and future goals. Everyone has a self-concept, whereas Erik Erikson argued that not everyone fully achieves identity. Erikson's theory of stages of development includes the identity crisis in which adolescents must explore different possibilities and integrate different parts of themselves before committing to their beliefs. He described the resolution of this process as a stage of \"identity achievement\" but also stressed that the identity challenge \"is never fully resolved once and for all at one point in time\". Adolescents begin by defining themselves based on their crowd membership. \"Clothes help teens explore new identities, separate from parents, and bond with peers.\" Fashion has played a major role when it comes to teenagers \"finding their selves\"; Fashion is always evolving, which corresponds with the evolution of change in the personality of teenagers. Adolescents attempt to define their identity by consciously styling themselves in different manners to find what best suits them. Trial and error in matching both their perceived image and the image others respond to and see, allows for the adolescent to grasp an understanding of who",
        "Stanley Schachter formulated his theory on the earlier work of a Spanish physician, Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n, who injected patients with epinephrine and subsequently asked them how they felt. Interestingly, Mara\u00f1\u00f3n found that most of these patients felt something but in the absence of an actual emotion-evoking stimulus, the patients were unable to interpret their physiological arousal as an experienced emotion. Schachter did agree that physiological reactions played a big role in emotions. He suggested that physiological reactions contributed to emotional experience by facilitating a focused cognitive appraisal of a given physiologically arousing event and that this appraisal was what defined the subjective emotional experience. Emotions were thus a result of two-stage process: general physiological arousal, and experience of emotion. For example, the physiological arousal, heart pounding, in a response to an evoking stimulus, the sight of a bear in the kitchen. The brain then quickly scans the area, to explain the pounding, and notices the bear. Consequently, the brain interprets the pounding heart as being the result of fearing the bear. With his student, Jerome Singer, Schachter demonstrated that subjects can have different emotional reactions despite being placed into the same physiological state with an injection of epinephrine. Subjects were observed to express either anger",

The Manchus' continued dominance was ensured by an ethnic quota for top bureaucratic appointments. Hong Taiji's reign also saw a fundamental change of policy towards his Han Chinese subjects. Nurhaci had treated Han in Liaodong differently according to how much grain they had, those with less than 5 to 7 sin were treated like chattel while those with more than that amount were rewarded with property. Due to a revolt by Han in Liaodong in 1623, Nurhachi, who previously gave concessions to conquered Han subjects in Liaodong, turned against them and ordered that they no longer be trusted; He enacted discriminatory policies and killings against them, while ordering that Han who assimilated to the Jurchen (in Jilin) before 1619 be treated equally as Jurchens were and not like the conquered Han in Liaodong. Hong Taiji instead incorporated them into the Jurchen \"nation\" as full (if not first-class) citizens, obligated to provide military service.

        "Y DNA studies tend to imply a small number of founders in an old population whose members parted and followed different migration paths. In most Jewish populations, these male line ancestors appear to have been mainly Middle Eastern. For example, Ashkenazi Jews share more common paternal lineages with other Jewish and Middle Eastern groups than with non-Jewish populations in areas where Jews lived in Eastern Europe, Germany and the French Rhine Valley. This is consistent with Jewish traditions in placing most Jewish paternal origins in the region of the Middle East. Conversely, the maternal lineages of Jewish populations, studied by looking at mitochondrial DNA, are generally more heterogeneous. Scholars such as Harry Ostrer and Raphael Falk believe this indicates that many Jewish males found new mates from European and other communities in the places where they migrated in the diaspora after fleeing ancient Israel. In contrast, Behar has found evidence that about 40% of Ashkenazi Jews originate maternally from just four female founders, who were of Middle Eastern origin.

        "In contemporary society, adolescents also face some risks as their sexuality begins to transform. While some of these, such as emotional distress (fear of abuse or exploitation) and sexually transmitted infections/diseases (STIs/STDs), including HIV/AIDS, are not necessarily inherent to adolescence, others such as teenage pregnancy (through non-use or failure of contraceptives) are seen as social problems in most western societies. One in four sexually active teenagers will contract an STI. Adolescents in the United States often chose \"anything but intercourse\" for sexual activity because they mistakenly believe it reduces the risk of STIs. Across the country, clinicians report rising diagnoses of herpes and human papillomavirus (HPV), which can cause genital warts, and is now thought to affect 15 percent of the teen population. Girls 15 to 19 have higher rates of gonorrhea than any other age group. One-quarter of all new HIV cases occur in those under the age of 21.

        "The deeper ancestral demography of Bermuda's population has been obscured by the ethnic homogenisation of the last four centuries. There is effectively no ethnic distinction between black and white Bermudians, other than those characterising recent immigrant communities. In the 17th century, this was not so. For the first hundred years of settlement, white Protestants of English heritage were the distinct majority, with white minorities of Irish (the native language of many of whom can be assumed to have been Gaelic) and Scots sent to Bermuda after the English invasions of their homelands that followed the English Civil War. Non-white minorities included Spanish-speaking, free (indentured) blacks from the West Indies, black chattel slaves primarily captured from Spanish and Portuguese ships by Bermudian privateers, and Native Americans, primarily from the Algonquian and other tribes of the Atlantic seaboard, but possibly from as far away as Mexico. By the 19th century, the white ethnically-English Bermudians had lost their numerical advantage. Despite the banning of the importation of Irish, and the repeated attempts to force free blacks to emigrate and the owners of black slaves to export them, the merging of the various minority groups, along with some of the white English, had resulted in a new demographic group, \"coloured\" (which term, in Bermuda, referred to anyone not wholly of European ancestry) Bermudians, gaining a slight majority.

        "The body\u2019s capability to react to antigen depends on a person's age, antigen type, maternal factors and the area where the antigen is presented. Neonates are said to be in a state of physiological immunodeficiency, because both their innate and adaptive immunological responses are greatly suppressed. Once born, a child\u2019s immune system responds favorably to protein antigens while not as well to glycoproteins and polysaccharides. In fact, many of the infections acquired by neonates are caused by low virulence organisms like Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas. In neonates, opsonic activity and the ability to activate the complement cascade is very limited. For example, the mean level of C3 in a newborn is approximately 65% of that found in the adult. Phagocytic activity is also greatly impaired in newborns. This is due to lower opsonic activity, as well as diminished up-regulation of integrin and selectin receptors, which limit the ability of neutrophils to interact with adhesion molecules in the endothelium. Their monocytes are slow and have a reduced ATP production, which also limits the newborn's phagocytic activity. Although, the number of total lymphocytes is significantly higher than in",
        "Some established acts continued to enjoy commercial success, such as Aerosmith, with their number one multi-platinum albums: Get a Grip (1993), which produced four Top 40 singles and became the band's best-selling album worldwide (going on to sell over 10 million copies), and Nine Lives (1997). In 1998, Aerosmith released the number one hit \"I Don't Want to Miss a Thing\", which remains the only single by a hard rock band to debut at number one. AC/DC produced the double platinum Ballbreaker (1995). Bon Jovi appealed to their hard rock audience with songs such as \"Keep the Faith\" (1992), but also achieved success in adult contemporary radio, with the Top 10 ballads \"Bed of Roses\" (1993) and \"Always\" (1994). Bon Jovi's 1995 album These Days was a bigger hit in Europe than it was in the United States, spawning four Top 10 singles on the UK Singles Chart. Metallica's Load (1996) and ReLoad (1997) each sold in excess of 4 million copies in the US and saw the band develop a more melodic and blues rock sound.",
        "A government report covered by the Guardian in 2002 indicates that between 1940 and 1979, the Ministry of Defence \"turned large parts of the country into a giant laboratory to conduct a series of secret germ warfare tests on the public\" and many of these tests \"involved releasing potentially dangerous chemicals and micro-organisms over vast swaths of the population without the public being told.\" The Ministry of Defence claims that these trials were to simulate germ warfare and that the tests were harmless. Still, families who have been in the area of many of the tests are experiencing children with birth defects and physical and mental handicaps and many are asking for a public inquiry. According to the report these tests affected estimated millions of people including one period between 1961 and 1968 where \"more than a million people along the south coast of England, from Torquay to the New Forest, were exposed to bacteria including e.coli and bacillus globigii, which mimics anthrax.\" Two scientists commissioned by the Ministry of Defence stated that these trials posed no risk to the public. This was confirmed by Sue Ellison, a representative of Porton Down who said that the results",
        "Like the reptiles, birds are primarily uricotelic, that is, their kidneys extract nitrogenous waste from their bloodstream and excrete it as uric acid instead of urea or ammonia through the ureters into the intestine. Birds do not have a urinary bladder or external urethral opening and (with exception of the ostrich) uric acid is excreted along with feces as a semisolid waste. However, birds such as hummingbirds can be facultatively ammonotelic, excreting most of the nitrogenous wastes as ammonia. They also excrete creatine, rather than creatinine like mammals. This material, as well as the output of the intestines, emerges from the bird's cloaca. The cloaca is a multi-purpose opening: waste is expelled through it, most birds mate by joining cloaca, and females lay eggs from it. In addition, many species of birds regurgitate pellets. Males within Palaeognathae (with the exception of the kiwis), the Anseriformes (with the exception of screamers), and in rudimentary forms in Galliformes (but fully developed in Cracidae) possess a penis, which is never present in Neoaves. The length is thought to be related to sperm competition. When not copulating, it is hidden within the proctodeum compartment within the cloaca, just inside the vent. The digestive system of birds is unique, with a crop for storage and a gizzard that contains swallowed stones for",
        "Regarding the timing of German rapprochement, many historians agree that the dismissal of Maxim Litvinov, whose Jewish ethnicity was viewed unfavorably by Nazi Germany, removed an obstacle to negotiations with Germany. Stalin immediately directed Molotov to \"purge the ministry of Jews.\" Given Litvinov's prior attempts to create an anti-fascist coalition, association with the doctrine of collective security with France and Britain, and pro-Western orientation by the standards of the Kremlin, his dismissal indicated the existence of a Soviet option of rapprochement with Germany.[f] Likewise, Molotov's appointment served as a signal to Germany that the USSR was open to offers. The dismissal also signaled to France and Britain the existence of a potential negotiation option with Germany. One British official wrote that Litvinov's disappearance also meant the loss of an admirable technician or shock-absorber, while Molotov's \"modus operandi\" was \"more truly Bolshevik than diplomatic or cosmopolitan.\" Carr argued that the Soviet Union's replacement of Foreign Minister Litvinov with Molotov on May 3, 1939 indicated not an irrevocable shift towards alignment with Germany, but rather was Stalin's way of engaging in hard bargaining with the British and the French by appointing a proverbial hard man,",
        "The Guangxu Emperor died on November 14, 1908, and on November 15, 1908, Cixi also died. Rumors held that she or Yuan Shikai ordered trusted eunuchs to poison the Guangxu Emperor, and an autopsy conducted nearly a century later confirmed lethal levels of arsenic in his corpse. Puyi, the oldest son of Zaifeng, Prince Chun, and nephew to the childless Guangxu Emperor, was appointed successor at the age of two, leaving Zaifeng with the regency. This was followed by the dismissal of General Yuan Shikai from his former positions of power. In April 1911 Zaifeng created a cabinet in which there were two vice-premiers. Nonetheless, this cabinet was also known by contemporaries as \"The Royal Cabinet\" because among the thirteen cabinet members, five were members of the imperial family or Aisin Gioro relatives. This brought a wide range of negative opinions from senior officials like Zhang Zhidong. The Wuchang Uprising of October 10, 1911, led to the creation of a new central government, the Republic of China, in Nanjing with Sun Yat-sen as its provisional head. Many provinces soon began \"separating\" from Qing control. Seeing a desperate situation unfold, the Qing government brought Yuan Shikai back to military power. He took control of his Beiyang Army to crush the revolution in Wuhan at the Battle of Yangxia. After taking the position of Prime Minister and creating his own cabinet, Yuan Shikai went as far as to",

At the age of 14, he chose bodybuilding over soccer as a career. Schwarzenegger has responded to a question asking if he was 13 when he started weightlifting: \"I actually started weight training when I was 15, but I'd been participating in sports, like soccer, for years, so I felt that although I was slim, I was well-developed, at least enough so that I could start going to the gym and start Olympic lifting.\" However, his official website biography claims: \"At 14, he started an intensive training program with Dan Farmer, studied psychology at 15 (to learn more about the power of mind over body) and at 17, officially started his competitive career.\" During a speech in 2001, he said, \"My own plan formed when I was 14 years old.

The A4 runs from Frankfurt in Hesse via Eisenach, Gotha, Erfurt, Weimar, Jena and Gera to Dresden in Saxony, connecting Thuringia's most important cities. At Hermsdorf junction it is connected with the A9. Both highways were widened from four to six lanes (three each way) after 1990, including some extensive re-routing in the Eisenach and Jena areas. Furthermore, three new motorways were built during the 1990s and 2000s. The A71 crosses the Land in southwest-northeast direction, connecting W\u00fcrzburg in Bavaria via Meiningen, Suhl, Ilmenau, Arnstadt, Erfurt and S\u00f6mmerda with Sangerhausen and Halle in Saxony-Anhalt. The crossing of the Thuringian Forest by the A71 has been one of Germany's most expensive motorway segments with various tunnels (including Germany's longest road tunnel, the Rennsteig Tunnel) and large bridges. The A73 starts at the A71 south of Erfurt in Suhl and runs south towards Nuremberg in Bavaria.

        "Public priests were appointed by the collegia. Once elected, a priest held permanent religious authority from the eternal divine, which offered him lifetime influence, privilege and immunity. Therefore, civil and religious law limited the number and kind of religious offices allowed an individual and his family. Religious law was collegial and traditional; it informed political decisions, could overturn them, and was difficult to exploit for personal gain. Priesthood was a costly honour: in traditional Roman practice, a priest drew no stipend. Cult donations were the property of the deity, whose priest must provide cult regardless of shortfalls in public funding \u2013 this could mean subsidy of acolytes and all other cult maintenance from personal funds. For those who had reached their goal in the Cursus honorum, permanent priesthood was best sought or granted after a lifetime's service in military or political life, or preferably both: it was a particularly honourable and active form of retirement which fulfilled an essential public duty. For a freedman or slave, promotion as one of the Compitalia seviri offered a high local profile, and opportunities in local politics; and therefore business. During the Imperial era, priesthood of the Imperial cult offered provincial elites full Roman citizenship and public prominence beyond their single year in religious office; in effect, it was the first step in a provincial cursus honorum. In Rome, the same Imperial cult role was performed by the Arval Brethren, once an obscure Republican priesthood dedicated to several deities, then co-opted by Augustus as part of his religious reforms. The Arvals offered prayer and sacrifice to Roman state gods at various temples",
        "When Nintendo released the NES in the US, the design styling was deliberately different from that of other game consoles. Nintendo wanted to distinguish its product from those of competitors and to avoid the generally poor reputation that game consoles had acquired following the video game crash of 1983. One result of this philosophy was to disguise the cartridge slot design as a front-loading zero insertion force (ZIF) cartridge socket, designed to resemble the front-loading mechanism of a VCR. The newly designed connector worked quite well when both the connector and the cartridges were clean and the pins on the connector were new. Unfortunately, the ZIF connector was not truly zero insertion force. When a user inserted the cartridge into the NES, the force of pressing the cartridge down and into place bent the contact pins slightly, as well as pressing the cartridge\u2019s ROM board back into the cartridge itself. Frequent insertion and removal of cartridges caused the pins to wear out from repeated usage over the years and the ZIF design proved more prone to interference by dirt and dust than an industry-standard",

The myth of Danaus, whose origin is Egypt, is a foundation legend of Argos. His daughters Danaides, were forced in Tartarus to carry a jug to fill a bathtub without a bottom. This myth is connected with a task that can never be fulfilled (Sisyphos) and the name can be derived from the PIE root *danu: \"river\". There is not any satisfactory theory on their origin. Some scholars connect Danaans with the Denyen, one of the groups of the sea peoples who attacked Egypt during the reign of Ramesses III (1187-1156 BCE). The same inscription mentions the Weshesh who might have been the Achaeans. The Denyen seem to have been inhabitants of the city Adana in Cilicia. Pottery similar to that of Mycenae itself has been found in Tarsus of Cilicia and it seems that some refugees from the Aegean went there after the collapse of the Mycenean civilization. These Cilicians seem to have been called Dananiyim, the same word as Danaoi who attacked Egypt in 1191 BC along with the Quaouash (or Weshesh) who may be Achaeans. They were also called Danuna according to",
        "Anthropologists such as C. Loring Brace, the philosophers Jonathan Kaplan and Rasmus Winther, and the geneticist Joseph Graves,[page needed] have argued that while there it is certainly possible to find biological and genetic variation that corresponds roughly to the groupings normally defined as \"continental races\", this is true for almost all geographically distinct populations. The cluster structure of the genetic data is therefore dependent on the initial hypotheses of the researcher and the populations sampled. When one samples continental groups, the clusters become continental; if one had chosen other sampling patterns, the clustering would be different. Weiss and Fullerton have noted that if one sampled only Icelanders, Mayans and Maoris, three distinct clusters would form and all other populations could be described as being clinally composed of admixtures of Maori, Icelandic and Mayan genetic materials. Kaplan and Winther therefore argue that, seen in this way, both Lewontin and Edwards are right in their arguments. They conclude that while racial groups are characterized by different allele frequencies, this does not mean that racial classification is a natural taxonomy of the human species, because multiple other genetic patterns can be found in human populations that crosscut",
        "Unlike the Spanish milled dollar the U.S. dollar is based upon a decimal system of values. In addition to the dollar the coinage act officially established monetary units of mill or one-thousandth of a dollar (symbol \u20a5), cent or one-hundredth of a dollar (symbol \u00a2), dime or one-tenth of a dollar, and eagle or ten dollars, with prescribed weights and composition of gold, silver, or copper for each. It was proposed in the mid-1800s that one hundred dollars be known as a union, but no union coins were ever struck and only patterns for the $50 half union exist. However, only cents are in everyday use as divisions of the dollar; \"dime\" is used solely as the name of the coin with the value of 10\u00a2, while \"eagle\" and \"mill\" are largely unknown to the general public, though mills are sometimes used in matters of tax levies, and gasoline prices are usually in the form of $X.XX9 per gallon, e.g., $3.599, sometimes written as $3.599\u204410.

Francesca Martinez and Richard Vaughan refused to carry the torch, while Konnie Huq decided to carry it and also speak out against China. The pro-Tibetan Member of Parliament Norman Baker asked all bearers to reconsider. Amid pressure from both directions, Prime Minister Gordon Brown welcomed the torch outside 10 Downing Street without holding or touching it. The London relay saw the torch surrounded by what the BBC described as \"a mobile protective ring.\" Protests began as soon as Redgrave started the event, leading to at least thirty-five arrests.

In the basic ladder match, the wrestlers or teams of wrestlers must climb a ladder to obtain a prize that is hoisted above the ring. The key to winning this match is that the wrestler or team of wrestlers must try to incapacitate each other long enough for one wrestler to climb the ladder and secure that prize for their team. As a result, the ladder can be used as a weapon. The prizes include \u2013 but are not limited to any given championship belt (the traditional prize), a document granting the winner the right to a future title shot, or any document that matters to the wrestlers involved in the match (such as one granting the winner a cash prize).

        "By March 2011, the market share of OS X in North America had increased to slightly over 14%. Whether the size of the Mac's market share and installed base is relevant, and to whom, is a hotly debated issue. Industry pundits have often called attention to the Mac's relatively small market share to predict Apple's impending doom, particularly in the early and mid-1990s when the company's future seemed bleakest. Others argue that market share is the wrong way to judge the Mac's success. Apple has positioned the Mac as a higher-end personal computer, and so it may be misleading to compare it to a budget PC. Because the overall market for personal computers has grown rapidly, the Mac's increasing sales numbers are effectively swamped by the industry's expanding sales volume as a whole. Apple's small market share, then, gives the impression that fewer people are using Macs than did ten years ago, when exactly the opposite is true. Soaring sales of the iPhone and iPad mean that the portion of Apple's profits represented by the Macintosh has declined in 2010, dropping to 24% from 46% two years earlier. Others try to de-emphasize market share, citing that it is rarely brought up in other industries. Regardless of the Mac's market share, Apple has remained profitable since",
        "The '98 season would begin on a somber note with the death of legendary broadcaster Harry Caray. After the retirement of Sandberg and the trade of Dunston, the Cubs had holes to fill and the signing of Henry Rodr\u00edguez, known affectionately as \"H-Rod\" to bat cleanup provided protection for Sammy Sosa in the lineup, as Rodriguez slugged 31 round-trippers in his first season in Chicago. Kevin Tapani led the club with a career high 19 wins, Rod Beck anchored a strong bullpen and Mark Grace turned in one of his best seasons. The Cubs were swamped by media attention in 1998, and the team's two biggest headliners were Sosa and rookie flamethrower Kerry Wood. Wood's signature performance was one-hitting the Houston Astros, a game in which he tied the major league record of 20 strikeouts in nine innings. His torrid strikeout numbers earned Wood the nickname \"Kid K,\" and ultimately earned him the 1998 NL Rookie of the Year award. Sosa caught fire in June, hitting a major league record 20 home runs in the month, and his home run race with Cardinals slugger Mark McGwire transformed the pair into international superstars in a matter of weeks. McGwire finished the season with a new major league record of 70 home runs, but Sosa's .308 average and 66 homers earned him the National League MVP Award.

Predators may hunt actively for prey in pursuit predation, or sit and wait for prey to approach within striking distance, as in ambush predators. Some predators kill large prey and dismember or chew it prior to eating it, such as a jaguar or a human; others may eat their (usually much smaller) prey whole, as does a bottlenose dolphin swallowing a fish, or a snake, duck or stork swallowing a frog. Some animals that kill both large and small prey for their size (domestic cats and dogs are prime examples) may do either depending upon the circumstances; either would devour a large insect whole but dismember a rabbit. Some predation entails venom that subdues a prey creature before the predator ingests the prey by killing, which the box jellyfish does, or disabling it, found in the behavior of the cone shell. In some cases, the venom, as in rattlesnakes and some spiders, contributes to the",

        "On the other hand, the lack of an effective royal justice system in the Kingdom led to the social conflict known as the Guerras Irmandi\u00f1as ('Wars of the brotherhoods'), when leagues of peasants and burghers, with the support of a number of knights, noblemen, and under legal protection offered by the remote king, toppled many of the castles of the Kingdom and briefly drove the noblemen into Portugal and Castile. Soon after, in the late 15th century, in the dynastic conflict between Isabella I of Castile and Joanna La Beltraneja, part of the Galician aristocracy supported Joanna. After Isabella's victory, she initiated an administrative and political reform which the chronicler Jeronimo Zurita defined as \"doma del Reino de Galicia\": 'It was then when the taming of Galicia began, because not just the local lords and knights, but all the people of that nation were the ones against the others very bold and warlike'. These reforms, while establishing a local government and tribunal (the Real Audiencia del Reino de Galicia) and bringing the nobleman under submission, also brought most Galician monasteries and institutions under Castilian control, in what has been criticized as a process of centralisation. At the same time the kings began to call the Xunta or Cortes of the Kingdom of Galicia,",

Focusing on irrigation projects, 1983 saw construction start on \"Gaddafi's Pet Project\", the Great Man-Made River; although designed to be finished by the end of the decade, it remained incomplete at the start of the 21st century. Military spending increased, while other administrative budgets were cut back. Libya had long supported the FROLINAT militia in neighbouring Chad, and in December 1980, re-invaded Chad at the request of the Frolinat-controlled GUNT government to aid in the civil war; in January 1981, Gaddafi suggested a political merger. The Organisation of African Unity (OAU) rejected this, and called for a Libyan withdrawal, which came about in November 1981. The civil war resumed, and so Libya sent troops back in, clashing with French forces who supported the southern Chadian forces. Many African nations had tired of Libya's policies of interference in foreign affairs; by 1980, nine African states had cut off diplomatic relations with Libya, while in 1982 the OAU cancelled its scheduled conference in Tripoli in order to prevent Gaddafi gaining chairmanship.

        "From his diagrams of a small number of particles interacting in spacetime, Feynman could then model all of physics in terms of the spins of those particles and the range of coupling of the fundamental forces. Feynman attempted an explanation of the strong interactions governing nucleons scattering called the parton model. The parton model emerged as a complement to the quark model developed by his Caltech colleague Murray Gell-Mann. The relationship between the two models was murky; Gell-Mann referred to Feynman's partons derisively as \"put-ons\". In the mid-1960s, physicists believed that quarks were just a bookkeeping device for symmetry numbers, not real particles, as the statistics of the Omega-minus particle, if it were interpreted as three identical strange quarks bound together, seemed impossible if quarks were real. The Stanford linear accelerator deep inelastic scattering experiments of the late 1960s showed, analogously to Ernest Rutherford's experiment of scattering alpha particles on gold nuclei in 1911, that nucleons (protons and neutrons) contained point-like particles that scattered electrons. It was natural to identify these with quarks, but Feynman's parton model attempted to interpret the experimental data in a way that did not introduce additional hypotheses. For example, the data showed that some 45% of the energy momentum was carried by electrically-neutral",
        "In late 1203, John attempted to relieve Ch\u00e2teau Gaillard, which although besieged by Philip was guarding the eastern flank of Normandy. John attempted a synchronised operation involving land-based and water-borne forces, considered by most historians today to have been imaginative in conception, but overly complex for forces of the period to have carried out successfully. John's relief operation was blocked by Philip's forces, and John turned back to Brittany in an attempt to draw Philip away from eastern Normandy. John successfully devastated much of Brittany, but did not deflect Philip's main thrust into the east of Normandy. Opinions vary amongst historians as to the military skill shown by John during this campaign, with most recent historians arguing that his performance was passable, although not impressive.[nb 8] John's situation began to deteriorate rapidly. The eastern border region of Normandy had been extensively cultivated by Philip and his predecessors for several years, whilst Angevin authority in the south had been undermined by Richard's giving away of various key castles some years before. His use of routier mercenaries in the central regions had rapidly eaten away his remaining support in this area too, which set the stage for a sudden collapse of Angevin power.[nb 9] John retreated back across the Channel in December, sending orders for the establishment of a fresh defensive line to the west",
        "In 2013, however, a study of Ashkenazi mitochondrial DNA by a team led by Martin B. Richards of the University of Huddersfield in England reached different conclusions, again corroborating the pre-2006 origin hypothesis. Testing was performed on the full 16,600 DNA units composing mitochondrial DNA (the 2006 Behar study had only tested 1,000 units) in all their subjects, and the study found that the four main female Ashkenazi founders had descent lines that were established in Europe 10,000 to 20,000 years in the past while most of the remaining minor founders also have a deep European ancestry. The study states that the great majority of Ashkenazi maternal lineages were not brought from the Near East (i.e., they were non-Israelite), nor were they recruited in the Caucasus (i.e., they were non-Khazar), but instead they were assimilated within Europe, primarily of Italian and Old French origins. Richards summarized the findings on the female line as such: \"[N]one [of the mtDNA] came from the North Caucasus, located along the border between",
        "At the 1912 Salon d'Automne an architectural installation was exhibited that quickly became known as Maison Cubiste (Cubist House), signed Raymond Duchamp-Villon and Andr\u00e9 Mare along with a group of collaborators. Metzinger and Gleizes in Du \"Cubisme\", written during the assemblage of the \"Maison Cubiste\", wrote about the autonomous nature of art, stressing the point that decorative considerations should not govern the spirit of art. Decorative work, to them, was the \"antithesis of the picture\". \"The true picture\" wrote Metzinger and Gleizes, \"bears its raison d'\u00eatre within itself. It can be moved from a church to a drawing-room, from a museum to a study. Essentially independent, necessarily complete, it need not immediately satisfy the mind: on the contrary, it should lead it, little by little, towards the fictitious depths in which the coordinative light resides. It does not harmonize with this or that ensemble; it harmonizes with things in general, with the universe: it is an organism...\". \"Mare's ensembles were accepted as frames for Cubist works because they allowed paintings and sculptures their independence\", writes Christopher Green, \"creating a play of contrasts, hence the involvement not only of Gleizes and Metzinger themselves, but of Marie Laurencin, the Duchamp brothers (Raymond Duchamp-Villon designed the facade) and Mare's old friends L\u00e9ger and Roger La Fresnaye\". La Maison Cubiste was a fully furnished house, with a staircase, wrought iron banisters, a living",
        "Some rock musicians today use mandolins, often single-stringed electric models rather than double-stringed acoustic mandolins. One example is Tim Brennan of the Irish-American punk rock band Dropkick Murphys. In addition to electric guitar, bass, and drums, the band uses several instruments associated with traditional Celtic music, including mandolin, tin whistle, and Great Highland bagpipes. The band explains that these instruments accentuate the growling sound they favor. The 1991 R.E.M. hit \"Losing My Religion\" was driven by a few simple mandolin licks played by guitarist Peter Buck, who also played the mandolin in nearly a dozen other songs. The single peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart (#1 on the rock and alternative charts), Luther Dickinson of North Mississippi Allstars and The Black Crowes has made frequent use of the mandolin, most notably on the Black Crowes song \"Locust Street.\" Armenian American rock group System of A Down makes extensive use of the mandolin on their 2005 double album Mezmerize/Hypnotize.

It was at this time that Eisenhower voiced his disagreements with the Democratic party and declared himself and his family to be Republicans. A \"Draft Eisenhower\" movement in the Republican Party persuaded him to declare his candidacy in the 1952 presidential election to counter the candidacy of non-interventionist Senator Robert A. Taft. The effort was a long struggle; Eisenhower had to be convinced that political circumstances had created a genuine duty for him to offer himself as a candidate, and that there was a mandate from the populace for him to be their President. Henry Cabot Lodge, who served as his campaign manager, and others succeeded in convincing him, and in June 1952 he resigned his command at NATO to campaign full-time. Eisenhower defeated Taft for the nomination, having won critical delegate votes from Texas. Eisenhower's campaign was noted for the simple but effective slogan, \"I Like Ike\". It was essential to his success that Eisenhower express opposition to",

Revel Entertainment Group was named as the project's developer for the Revel Casino. Revel was hindered with many problems, with the biggest setback to the company being in April 2010 when Morgan Stanley, the owner of 90% of Revel Entertainment Group, decided to discontinue funding for continued construction and put its stake in Revel up for sale. Early in 2010 the New Jersey state legislature passed a bill offering tax incentives to attract new investors and complete the job, but a poll by Fairleigh Dickinson University's PublicMind released in March 2010 showed that three of five voters (60%) opposed the legislation, and two of three of those who opposed it \"strongly\" opposed it. Ultimately, Governor Chris Christie offered Revel $261 million in state tax credits to assist the casino once it opened. As of March 2011[update], Revel had completed all of the exterior work and had continued work on the interior after finally receiving the funding necessary to complete construction. It had a soft opening in April 2012, and was fully open by May 2012. Ten months",
        "The final major aspect of identity formation is self-esteem. Self-esteem is defined as one's thoughts and feelings about one's self-concept and identity. Most theories on self-esteem state that there is a grand desire, across all genders and ages, to maintain, protect and enhance their self-esteem. Contrary to popular belief, there is no empirical evidence for a significant drop in self-esteem over the course of adolescence. \"Barometric self-esteem\" fluctuates rapidly and can cause severe distress and anxiety, but baseline self-esteem remains highly stable across adolescence. The validity of global self-esteem scales has been questioned, and many suggest that more specific scales might reveal more about the adolescent experience. Girls are most likely to enjoy high self-esteem when engaged in supportive relationships with friends, the most important function of friendship to them is having someone who can provide social and moral support. When they fail to win friends' approval or couldn't find someone with whom to share common activities and common interests, in these cases, girls suffer from low self-esteem. In contrast, boys are more concerned with establishing and asserting their independence",

        "A period of division for the Liberals followed, with former Treasurer John Howard competing with former Foreign Minister Andrew Peacock for supremacy. The Australian economy was facing the early 1990s recession. Unemployment reached 11.4% in 1992. Under Dr John Hewson, in November 1991, the opposition launched the 650-page Fightback! policy document \u2212 a radical collection of \"dry\", economic liberal measures including the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST), various changes to Medicare including the abolition of bulk billing for non-concession holders, the introduction of a nine-month limit on unemployment benefits, various changes to industrial relations including the abolition of awards, a $13 billion personal income tax cut directed at middle and upper income earners, $10 billion in government spending cuts, the abolition of state payroll taxes and the privatisation of a large number of government owned enterprises \u2212 representing the start of a very different future direction to the keynesian economic conservatism practiced by previous Liberal/National Coalition governments.

He sent him, indeed, five hundred pieces of gold \"to bear his charges\" but Liberius refused them, saying, he might bestow them on his flatters; as he did also a like present from the empress, bidding the messenger learn to believe in Christ, and not to persecute the Church of God. Attempts were made to leave the presents in The Church, but Liberius threw them out. Constantius hereupon sent for him under a strict guard to Milan, where, in a conference recorded by Theodoret, he boldly told Constantius that Athanasius had been acquitted at Sardica, and his enemies proved calumniators (see: \"calumny\") and impostors, and that it was unjust to condemn a person who could not be legally convicted of any crime. The emperor was reduced to silence on every article, but being the more out of patience, ordered him into banishment. Liberius went into exile.

        "The Montana Territory was formed on April 26, 1864, when the U.S. passed the Organic Act. Schools started forming in the area before it was officially a territory as families started settling into the area. The first schools were subscription schools that typically held in the teacher's home. The first formal school on record was at Fort Owen in Bitterroot valley in 1862. The students were Indian children and the children of Fort Owen employees. The first school term started in early winter and only lasted until February 28. Classes were taught by Mr. Robinson. Another early subscription school was started by Thomas Dimsdale in Virginia City in 1863. In this school students were charged $1.75 per week. The Montana Territorial Legislative Assembly had its inaugural meeting in 1864. The first legislature authorized counties to levy taxes for schools, which set the foundations for public schooling. Madison County was the first to take advantage of the newly authorized taxes and it formed fhe first public school in Virginia City in 1886. The first school year was scheduled to begin in January 1866, but severe weather postponed its opening until March. The first school year ran through the summer and didn't end until August 17. One of the first teachers at the school was Sarah Raymond. She was a 25-year-old woman who had traveled to Virginia City via wagon train in 1865. To become a certified teacher, Raymond took a test in her home and paid a $6 fee",
        "On 20 June 1794, Burke received a vote of thanks from the Commons for his services in the Hastings Trial and he immediately resigned his seat, being replaced by his son Richard. A tragic blow fell upon Burke with the loss of Richard in August 1794, to whom he was tenderly attached, and in whom he saw signs of promise, which were not patent to others and which, in fact, appear to have been non-existent (though this view may have rather reflected the fact that Richard Burke had worked successfully in the early battle for Catholic emancipation). King George III, whose favour he had gained by his attitude on the French Revolution, wished to create him Earl of Beaconsfield, but the death of his son deprived the opportunity of such an honour and all its attractions, so the only award he would accept was a pension of \u00a32,500. Even this modest reward was attacked by the Duke of Bedford and the Earl of Lauderdale, to whom Burke replied in his Letter to a Noble Lord (1796): \"It cannot at this time be too often repeated; line upon line; precept upon precept; until it comes into the currency of a proverb, To innovate is not to reform\". He argued that he was rewarded on merit, but the Duke of Bedford received his rewards from inheritance",
        "The nation almost immediately fell into civil war that involved various factions fighting one another; these factions were often distinguished by clan loyalties. More than 500,000 residents fled during this time because of persecution, increased poverty and better economic opportunities in the West or in other former Soviet republics. Emomali Rahmon came to power in 1992, defeating former prime minister Abdumalik Abdullajanov in a November presidential election with 58% of the vote. The elections took place shortly after the end of the war, and Tajikistan was in a state of complete devastation. The estimated dead numbered over 100,000. Around 1.2 million people were refugees inside and outside of the country. In 1997, a ceasefire was reached between Rahmon and opposition parties under the guidance of Gerd D.

Figo had become a cult hero, and was considered by Catalans to be one of their own. However, Barcelona fans were distraught by Figo's decision to join arch-rivals Real Madrid, and, during subsequent visits to the Camp Nou, Figo was given an extremely hostile reception. Upon his first return, a piglet's head and a full bottle of whiskey were thrown at him from the crowd.

        "In 1954, prominent Serbian and Croatian writers, linguists, and literary critics, supported by Matica srpska and Matica hrvatska, signed the Novi Sad Agreement, which initially declared: \"Serbs, Croats, and Montenegrins share a single language with two equivalent variants developed around Zagreb (western) and Belgrade (eastern)\". The agreement emphasized the equal status of Cyrillic and Latin scripts, as well as Ekavian and Ijekavian pronunciations. It stipulated that Serbo-Croatian would be the official language name, while traditional Serbian and Croatian would remain in informal use. Matica hrvatska and Matica srpska committed to collaborating on a dictionary, and a joint committee of Serbian and Croatian linguists was tasked with preparing a pravopis. During the 1960s, both publications were released simultaneously in Ijekavian Latin in Zagreb and Ekavian Cyrillic in Novi Sad. However, Croatian linguists viewed this as an act of unitarianism. Their evidence was somewhat inconsistent: Stjepan Babi\u0107 complained about Belgrade television's consistent use of Latin script, which, while true, did not necessarily indicate unequal rights but rather reflected usage patterns and prestige. Babi\u0107 also criticized the Novi Sad Dictionary (1967) for listing variant words side by side, which could be seen as careful respect for both variants rather than unitarism. Interestingly, Croatian linguists critiqued the unitaristic aspects of the Dictionary written by their own compatriots and overlooked the fact that the Pravopisni rje\u010dnik's material originated from the Croatian Philological Society. Despite these nuances, Croatian intellectuals issued the Declaration on the Status and Name of the Croatian Literary Language in 1967. Forty-five years later, in 2012, the Croatian weekly journal Forum republished the Declaration with a critical analysis.",
        "The Bush administration shifted focus to Iraq, asserting the urgent need to remove Saddam Hussein from power. The primary justification centered on allegations that Hussein's regime had attempted to acquire nuclear materials and failed to provide a comprehensive account of biological and chemical weapons previously in its possession. The administration claimed that both the possession of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and the inability to account for them would constitute a violation of UN sanctions. Despite the Bush administration's aggressive promotion of the WMD claim, major global powers like China, France, Germany, and Russia remained unconvinced of Iraq's threat and opposed UN Security Council authorization for military action. In November 2002, Iraq allowed UN weapon inspectors to enter, who were conducting investigations when the Bush administration decided to launch the war without UN approval, ordering the inspectors to leave. On March 20, 2003, the United States invaded Iraq with a \"coalition of the willing,\" primarily comprising troops from the United Kingdom, Australia, and Poland. Within approximately three weeks, the invasion toppled the Iraqi government and military, but no weapons of mass destruction were discovered. While traces of former weapons facilities were reported, no conclusive evidence emerged. On May 1, President George W. Bush dramatically landed on the USS Abraham Lincoln and declared an end to \"major combat operations.\" Initially enjoying a 66% approval rating, Bush's public support gradually eroded as the reconstruction efforts stalled, violence persisted, and the absence of WMD stockpiles raised serious questions about the war's original justification.",
        "The environment significantly influences an adolescent's identity formation. While research predominantly focuses on white, middle-class youth, evidence indicates that privileged backgrounds correlate with more successful identity development. The adolescent identity-building phase is a critical life stage. Recent demographic trends reveal that the transition to adulthood now spans a longer period compared to mid-20th century patterns. Consequently, youth\u2014encompassing late adolescence and early adulthood\u2014has emerged as a more significant life phase. This shift has highlighted numerous contributing factors to social identity development, including commitment, coping mechanisms, and social media. An adolescent's environment profoundly shapes these developmental elements. Those from more advantaged backgrounds typically encounter broader opportunities and more positive circumstances. Conversely, adolescents from challenging urban or high-crime neighborhoods may face environments that potentially hinder their personal growth. Adolescence represents a sensitive developmental period where exposure to negative influences can substantially impact future life choices. In contrast, teenagers from affluent suburban communities are more likely to engage in identity-enhancing activities, fostering a more robust and positive self-concept.",
        "The National Football League's preseason stands out for its highly organized structure compared to other team sports. Each NFL team plays precisely four preseason exhibition games annually, with two home and two away matches, except for two teams participating in a fifth game\u2014the Pro Football Hall of Fame Game. These August exhibitions primarily serve to help coaches reduce their roster from 90 offseason players to the 53-player regular-season limit. While preseason game scheduling is less rigid than regular-season matchups, numerous restrictions and traditions limit opponent selection, and specific days and times for games are constrained. Unlike baseball and hockey, split-squad games are not permitted. The NFL has hosted exhibition games internationally in Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia, and Mexico to expand league popularity, with a proposed Chinese game ultimately canceled due to financial and logistical challenges. The league has effectively banned non-NFL opponent games, with the last interleague match occurring in 1972 and the final game against non-NFL teams (College All-Stars) held in 1976. Many fans find these exhibitions unpopular, resenting season-ticket packages that require full-price payment for two home preseason games. Multiple fan lawsuits challenging this practice have been unsuccessful. The Pro Bowl, now played the week before the Super Bowl, is also considered an exhibition game.",
        "In reality, not every rule infraction leads to a disqualification, as referees have discretionary power and are not required to halt the match. Typically, only specific offenses like low blows, weapon use, outside interference, or attacking the referee will prompt an immediate disqualification. In WWE, a referee must personally witness the violation to end the match, with video evidence rarely sufficing, and their decision is almost always definitive, though Dusty finishes can result in the ruling being overturned. Referee knockouts during matches are common, known as a \"ref bump\", during which wrestlers can freely break rules until the official is revived or replaced. Sometimes, a referee might disqualify a wrestler presuming they caused the knockout, though most such incidents are strategically planned to give a wrestler, often a heel, an advantage. For instance, a wrestler might intentionally be whipped into a referee at a controlled speed, temporarily incapacitating them. During this brief window, a wrestler could potentially pin their opponent for a three-count and seemingly win, though the fallen referee prevents an official count. Occasionally, another referee might rush from backstage to make the count, but by then, the pinned wrestler typically has had enough time to kick out.",
        "In the 15th century, the cathedral underwent architectural modifications with the addition of a dome and extended naves behind the choir, which connected the building to the tower and created a main entrance. Archbishop Luis Alfonso de los Cameros initiated the construction of the main chapel in 1674, adorning its walls with marbles and bronzes in the characteristic Baroque style of the era. At the start of the 18th century, German architect Conrad Rudolphus designed the fa\u00e7ade of the main entrance. Two additional doors lead into the transept: one, the Apostles' door, displays pure pointed Gothic architecture from the 14th century, while the other is known as the Pal\u00e1u door. Later architectural additions to the cathedral's rear diminished its overall height. The 18th-century restoration softened the pointed arches, replaced Gothic columns with Corinthian pillars, and redecorated the walls. The dome lacks a lantern, featuring a plain ceiling pierced by two large side windows. The cathedral contains four chapels on each side, along with additional chapels in the choir, transept, and sanctuary, and houses numerous paintings by prominent artists. A silver reredos originally behind the altar was melted down during the 1808 war to fund military campaigns. Two paintings by Francisco Goya are located in the San Francesco chapel.

Entertainment Weekly's Ken Tucker described it as \"crazily entertaining\" yet \"musically inconsequential\". The series was variously characterized as a \"sadistic musical bake-off\" and \"a romp in humiliation\". Critics also took issue with the show's commercial aspects, with Karla Peterson from The San Diego Union-Tribune describing it as \"a conniving multimedia monster\" that reflects cultural decadence. The show's controversial decision to have its first season winner perform the national anthem at the Lincoln Memorial on the 9/11 anniversary drew sharp criticism. Lisa de Moraes of The Washington Post sarcastically remarked that \"The terrorists have won\", critiquing both the show's marketing strategy and its voting mechanism.

        "During the 1980s, the media's intense fascination with the royal family's personal lives and opinions sparked numerous sensational and often unverified stories in the press. Kelvin MacKenzie, editor of The Sun, famously instructed his staff to prioritize provocative headlines about the royals, even if the stories lacked factual accuracy. Donald Trelford, writing in The Observer on 21 September 1986, highlighted how the royal narrative had become so sensationalized that the distinction between truth and fiction had become blurred, with newspapers showing little concern for factual verification. The Sunday Times reported on 20 July 1986 that the Queen was concerned about Margaret Thatcher's economic policies, social divisions, high unemployment, riots, the miners' strike, and Thatcher's stance on South African apartheid. While sources like royal aide Michael Shea and Commonwealth Secretary-General Shridath Ramphal were cited, Shea argued his comments were misinterpreted. Rumors circulated that Thatcher claimed the Queen would support the Social Democratic Party, though Thatcher's biographer John Campbell dismissed this as journalistic fabrication. Despite apparent tensions, Thatcher later expressed personal admiration for the Queen, who subsequently honored Thatcher with membership in the Order of Merit and the Order of the Garter. Former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney also noted Elizabeth's behind-the-scenes role in combating apartheid.",

Adjacent rooms include the Throne Room and Green Drawing Room, which acts as an anteroom to the Throne Room and part of the ceremonial route from the Guard Room at the top of the Grand Staircase. The Guard Room features white marble statues of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert in Roman costume, set against tapestry-lined walls. These formal rooms are reserved for ceremonial and official events but are open to the public during summer.",
        "To expand and solidify the dynasty's dominion in Central Asia, the Kangxi Emperor personally orchestrated military campaigns against the Dzungars in Outer Mongolia. He successfully drove out Galdan's invading forces from these territories, which were subsequently integrated into the empire. Galdan was ultimately killed during the Dzungar\u2013Qing War. In 1683, Qing forces accepted Taiwan's surrender from Zheng Keshuang, Koxinga's grandson, who had previously seized the island from Dutch colonists. Zheng Keshuang was granted the title \"Duke Haicheng\" and incorporated into the Han Chinese Plain Red Banner of the Eight Banners upon moving to Beijing. Several Ming princes, including the Prince of Ningjing Zhu Shugui and Prince Zhu Honghuan, had accompanied Koxinga to Taiwan between 1661-1662, residing in the Kingdom of Tungning. The Qing returned the 17 remaining Ming princes to mainland China in 1683, where they lived in exile, their lives spared from execution. Capturing Taiwan enabled Kangxi's forces to engage in battles over Albazin, Russia's far eastern outpost. Zheng's former soldiers, such as the rattan shield troops, were integrated into the Eight Banners and deployed against Russian Cossacks at Albazin. The 1689 Treaty of Nerchinsk, China's first formal agreement with a European power, maintained border peace for nearly two centuries. Following Galdan's death, his Buddhist followers attempted to influence the Dalai Lama's selection, prompting Kangxi to dispatch armies to Lhasa and install a Dalai Lama sympathetic to Qing interests.",
        "From the 1970s onward, Stuart Hall and his colleagues pioneered an influential intellectual movement that transformed academic understanding of cultural phenomena. The emerging field integrated multiple disciplines, including political economy, sociology, communication, media studies, anthropology, and philosophy, to examine cultural texts and practices. Researchers in this domain often explore how specific phenomena intersect with ideology, social identity, class, and gender dynamics. Cultural studies focuses on the meanings and practices embedded in everyday life, investigating how people engage with various activities and objects within their cultural context. The field is particularly interested in understanding practices that are not necessarily rational but culturally significant, such as social behaviors that emerge from a desire to belong. As global capitalism expanded, cultural studies began examining resistance to Western cultural dominance, recognizing globalization as a process that potentially undermines local cultural integrity. This perspective views globalization as a complex system that can be simultaneously transformative and oppressive, challenging the cultural autonomy of diverse societies worldwide.",
        "Libya's economic landscape increasingly embraced privatization, with government officials claiming to pursue \"people's socialism\" instead of traditional capitalism, despite moving away from the socialist principles outlined in The Green Book. Gaddafi endorsed these economic reforms, advocating for widespread privatization in a 2003 speech. The oil industry was largely transferred to private corporations, and foreign investment surged to $40 billion by 2004, a sixfold increase from the previous year. Public demonstrations emerged in response to these changes, and in March 2006, revolutionary hard-liners assumed control of the GPC cabinet, moderating the reform pace without completely halting progress. By 2010, plans were proposed to privatize half the Libyan economy over the following decade. While political liberalization remained limited and Gaddafi maintained predominant control, municipal councils received expanded powers in March 2010. Reformist technocrats increasingly gained governance positions, with Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, Gaddafi's son and heir apparent, being the most prominent. He publicly criticized Libya's human rights record, proposed a draft constitution, and was appointed to lead the PSLC in October 2009. Saif established several private media channels in 2008 to promote tourism, but these were nationalized in 2009 after criticizing the government. In October 2010, Gaddafi apologized to African leaders on behalf of Arab nations for their historical involvement in the slave trade.",
        "Mammalian hair, or pelage, exhibits diverse color variations across populations, individual organisms, and even within a single animal. Color differences between light and dark spectrums are prevalent in mammalian groups. These variations can stem from age-related factors or other influences. Ecological interactions, environmental conditions, and selective pressures frequently drive mammalian color diversity, promoting survival through specific color adaptations. Camouflage emerges as the primary mechanism for color variation, enabling organisms to conceal themselves from predators or prey. However, sexual selection, communication, and physiological processes also contribute to color evolution. Coat color serves multiple functions, including intraspecies communication, such as warning signals, health indicators, mother-offspring interactions, and predator deterrence. Research indicates that differences in male and female coat colors can reveal nutritional and hormonal information crucial for mate selection. Physiological responses, like temperature regulation in extreme environments, further explain color variations. Despite extensive observations, the genetic mechanisms linking coat color to specific genes remain partially unknown. Genetic sites responsible for pigmentation are understood to affect phenotype by modifying hair pigmentation distribution and hair density. Quantitative trait mapping helps researchers better comprehend the genetic loci driving pigmentation variation, though significant gaps in understanding gene expression persist.",
        "During the French Enlightenment in the mid-18th century, the term \"humanism\" began to acquire a more ideological meaning. In 1765, an anonymous author in a French periodical described \"the general love of humanity\" as a previously unnamed virtue, suggesting the creation of a word for this beautiful and necessary concept. The late 18th and early 19th centuries witnessed the emergence of numerous grassroots philanthropic and benevolent societies focused on human advancement and knowledge dissemination. Following the French Revolution, the notion that human virtue could be generated through reason alone, without traditional religious institutions, was vehemently criticized by conservative religious and political figures like Edmund Burke and Joseph de Maistre, who viewed it as a form of human deification. Consequently, humanism started to carry a negative connotation. The Oxford English Dictionary noted the term's use by an English clergyman in 1812 to describe those believing in Christ's \"mere humanity\" rather than divine nature. In this polarized environment, where ecclesiastical institutions resisted social and political reforms, liberal reformers embraced humanism as an alternative human-centered philosophy. Anarchist Proudhon characterized it as a \"worship, deification of humanity,\" while Ernest Renan proclaimed in his work that pure humanism would become the future religion, celebrating humanity's life and elevating human experience to a moral value.",
        "In multi-party political systems, no single party typically secures absolute power, leading to collaborative coalition governments. This trend has been prominent in Ireland since the 1980s and is standard in Germany across national, state, and local levels. In Iceland, coalition governments have been the norm since the republic's establishment, typically involving the Independence Party and another party like the Social Democratic Alliance. Similarly, in Ireland since 1989, no party has governed independently, with coalitions exclusively led by either Fianna F\u00e1il or Fine Gael. Coalition governments can potentially facilitate political change more effectively than rigid two-party systems, though this is not always guaranteed. In two-party systems with fundamental policy disagreements, such as the current U.S. political landscape between Democrats and Republicans, policy progression can be significantly hindered. Conversely, coalition governments can also struggle to implement changes, as demonstrated in post-World War II France and Italy. When a single party controls all elective branches, policy transformations can be rapid and substantial, as evidenced by Democratic presidents like Wilson, Roosevelt, and Johnson, and Republican leaders such as Lincoln and Reagan, with Obama briefly experiencing such an advantage between 2009 and 2011.",
        "Emotions drive social interactions and relationships, closely linked to basic physiology, especially stress systems. They are connected to the anti-stress complex and the oxytocin-attachment system, which is crucial for bonding. Emotional temperaments influence social connectedness and fitness in complex social environments (Kurt Kortschal 2013). These characteristics are shared across species and taxa, resulting from genetic transmission. DNA sequences encode information for protein assembly in cells. Zygotes inherit genetic information from parental germ cells, and during speciation, heritable traits that enabled ancestral survival and reproduction are passed down, along with potentially beneficial new traits. In the five million years since human and chimpanzee lineages diverged, only about 1.2% of their genetic material has changed, suggesting that distinguishing characteristics are encoded in this small DNA segment, including behaviors. Researchers studying animal behaviors have primarily identified intraspecific gene-dependent behavioral phenotypes. For instance, in voles, minor genetic variations in a vasopressin receptor gene correspond to significant differences in social organization and mating systems (Hammock & Young 2005). Another example is the FOCP2 gene, involved in neural circuitry for speech and language (Vargha-Khadem et al. 2005), which differs from chimpanzee versions by only a few mutations and has existed for about 200,000 years, coinciding with modern human emergence (Enard et al. 2002). Speech, language, and social organization form the foundation of emotions.",
        "Various research traditions are increasingly employing the concept of identity to analyze different phenomena. One significant implication emerges in occupational contexts, particularly in stigmatized or \"dirty work\" environments. Individuals are drawn to or repelled from certain jobs based on how well they align with their preferred organizational self. Some occupations carry inherent stigmas or social perceptions that challenge workers' professional identities. For instance, correctional officers struggle to overcome perceptions of being \"glorified maids.\" Workers in such roles must develop strategies to construct a positive self-image and justify their occupational choices. The process involves managing workplace satisfaction and overall life quality. Creating a favorable sense of self becomes particularly challenging when societal standards label one's work as undesirable. Employees often must navigate complex discourses that question their professional legitimacy. When workers encounter obstacles in transforming their stigmatized work into a source of pride, they may resort to strategies like blaming clients to affirm their professional identity and maintain a sense of personal worth.",
        "Jeffrey Long and Rick Kittles provide a critical analysis of the application of FST to human populations in their 2003 paper, challenging the commonly cited 85% genetic diversity figure. They argue that this statistic is misleading because it suggests an uniform distribution of genetic variation across all human populations. Instead, they propose a more nuanced understanding of human population history that recognizes the hierarchical and interconnected nature of human groups. According to their perspective, some populations are ancestral to others, forming paraphyletic groups with complex genetic relationships. The recent African origin theory exemplifies this, showing that non-African populations derive from a limited, non-representative sample of the original African population. Consequently, non-African groups share closer genetic similarities with each other and certain African populations, particularly those from East Africa. The migration out of Africa represented a significant genetic bottleneck, with much of the original African genetic diversity not being transmitted to other populations. This model suggests that genetic diversity progressively diminishes with distance from Africa, with each migration event representing a genetic subset of the parent population. Their research indicates that while a single African population contains approximately 100% of human genetic diversity, a population from New Guinea might only retain about 70%. Despite these variations, Long and Kittles conclude that humans remain genetically homogeneous compared to other mammalian species.",
        "Darwin's book was extensively translated during his lifetime, but translators encountered challenges with concepts and metaphors, often introducing personal biases. While distributing presentation copies in France and Germany, Darwin hoped qualified translators would collaborate with local publishers. He initially welcomed Heinrich Georg Bronn, a distinguished naturalist, but the 1860 German translation incorporated Bronn's own perspectives, including controversial themes Darwin had intentionally excluded. Bronn reinterpreted \"favoured races\" as \"perfected races\" and added essays on life's origins and religious implications, influenced by his Naturphilosophie philosophy. After producing a second edition in 1862 based on Darwin's suggestions, Bronn died suddenly. Darwin subsequently worked closely with Julius Victor Carus, who published an improved translation in 1867. French translation attempts initially failed, with Cl\u00e9mence Royer's 1862 version including an introduction promoting social Darwinism and eugenics, along with extensive personal annotations. Despite Darwin's correspondence and attempts to modify subsequent editions, he remained dissatisfied until Edmond Barbier's translation emerged in 1876. Translations proliferated during Darwin's lifetime, including Dutch in 1860, Italian and Russian by 1864, and versions in Swedish, Danish, Polish, Hungarian, Spanish, and Serbian between 1871 and 1878. By 1977, the work had been translated into an additional 18 languages.",
        "Hegel aims to preserve the core principles of German idealism, particularly Kant's view that ethical reasoning transcends finite impulses. In Hegel's framework, a fundamental connection between thought and being must exist for any human observer (subject) to comprehend an external entity (object). Through the concept of \"subject-object identity,\" both subject and object share Spirit as their conceptual inner essence\u2014effectively rendering them identical. However, before Spirit achieves self-realization and advances to Absolute Spirit, the human mind mistakenly perceives observed objects as fundamentally separate or alien. As Hegel describes, \"The object is revealed to it [to 'subject'] by [as] something alien, and it does not recognize itself.\" Self-realization occurs when Hegel, representing Spirit's collective human consciousness, recognizes that every object is essentially himself, since both subject and object are manifestations of Spirit. Upon this self-realization, Spirit becomes Absolute Spirit, transforming the \"finite\" (human) into the \"infinite\" (divine), thereby replacing the supernatural theistic concept of God with human self-divinity. As Tucker articulates, Hegelianism represents \"a religion of self-worship\" where humanity compulsively and ultimately successfully strives to elevate itself to divine status.",
        "The Israelites experienced political sovereignty twice in ancient times, initially during the Biblical judges' era and subsequently throughout the United Monarchy. Following the United Monarchy's decline, the territory split into Israel and Judah. The term \"Jew\" emerged from the Roman \"Judean,\" referring to inhabitants of the southern Judah kingdom. The transition from \"Israelites\" to \"Jews\" is explicitly documented in the Book of Esther from the 4th century BCE, part of the Tanakh's Ketuvim section. In 587 BC, Nebuchadnezzar II of the Neo-Babylonian Empire besieged Jerusalem, demolished the First Temple, and deported Judah's most prominent citizens. By 586 BC, Judah lost its independence, leaving its Jewish population stateless. The Babylonian exile concluded in 539 BCE when the Achaemenid Empire conquered Babylon, and Cyrus the Great permitted exiled Jews to return to Yehud and reconstruct their Temple. The Second Temple was completed in 515 BCE. Yehud province remained peaceful within the Achaemenid Empire until Alexander the Great's conquest around 333 BCE. Jews also experienced political independence during the Hasmonean dynasty (140-37 BCE) and partially under the Herodian dynasty (37 BCE-6 CE). Since the Second Temple's destruction in 70 CE, most Jews have lived in diaspora, frequently experiencing persecution as an ethnic minority in various countries.",

The Super Slim model was available in three variants: a 500 GB version, a 250 GB version (excluding PAL regions), and a 12 GB flash storage model exclusively for PAL regions. The 12 GB version could be upgraded with an official 250 GB hard drive, and a vertical stand was also released. The United Kingdom saw the 500 GB model launch on September 28, 2012, and the 12 GB model on October 12, 2012.

        "In 1919, following the Treaty of Versailles, Strasbourg was returned to France in line with U.S. President Woodrow Wilson's \"Fourteen Points\" without a public vote. The transfer date was retroactively set on Armistice Day. A referendum in Strasbourg would likely not have favored France, as political parties advocating for Alsatian autonomy or French connection represented only a small fraction of votes in the previous Reichstag and local elections. Alsatian autonomists sympathetic to France had gained significant support in rural areas and smaller towns since the region's annexation by Germany in 1871. The movement originated with the first Reichstag election, with elected representatives known as \"les d\u00e9put\u00e9s protestataires\" who, until Bismarck's fall in 1890, were the sole Alsatian deputies demanding the territories' return to France. In the final Reichstag election in Strasbourg and surrounding areas, Social Democrats emerged victorious. As the region's administrative capital, the city was populated by numerous Germans appointed by Berlin's central government and boasted a thriving economy, which might explain the voting disparities between urban and rural areas. After the war, many Germans departed Strasbourg for Germany, with some being denounced by locals or expelled by new authorities. The Saverne Affair remained a vivid memory among Alsatians.",
        "Zhejiang's primary manufacturing sectors encompass electromechanical industries, textiles, chemical industries, food processing, and construction materials. The province has developed its distinctive \"Zhejiang model\" of economic growth, which centers on fostering entrepreneurship, supporting small businesses that are market-responsive, making substantial infrastructure investments, and producing low-cost goods in large quantities for both domestic and international markets. This approach has transformed Zhejiang into one of China's most prosperous provinces, with the \"Zhejiang spirit\" becoming legendary nationwide. However, economic experts now express concerns about the model's long-term viability, arguing that it is inefficient, places excessive strain on resources and public infrastructure, and limits businesses' potential to advance into more sophisticated and technologically complex industries. The economic center is progressively shifting from North Zhejiang, centered on Hangzhou, to the southeastern region around Wenzhou and Taizhou. In 2009, urban residents' disposable income reached 24,611 yuan (US$3,603), with an 8.3% annual real growth, while rural residents' pure income stood at 10,007 yuan (US$1,465), reflecting an 8.1% year-on-year increase. By 2011, Zhejiang's nominal GDP had grown to 3.20 trillion yuan (US$506 billion), with a per capita GDP of 44,335 yuan (US$6,490). In 2009, the province's primary, secondary, and tertiary industries were valued at 116.2 billion yuan (US$17 billion), 1.1843 trillion yuan (US$173.4 billion), and 982.7 billion yuan (US$143.9 billion), respectively.",
        "In its early stages, MCA produced discs for various companies like Paramount, Disney, and Warner Bros. Some of these companies added their own branding to the disc jacket to indicate non-MCA ownership. Following the closure of Discovision Associates in early 1982, Universal Studio's videodisc software label, known as MCA Videodisc until 1984, began re-releasing numerous DiscoVision titles. However, many of these reissues, including Battlestar Galactica and Jaws, were time-compressed versions of their original CAV or CLV DiscoVision releases. The CLV re-issue of Jaws notably lacked its original soundtrack, with incidental background music replaced due to licensing costs, a situation that persisted until the THX LaserDisc box set's release in 1995. The Universal/Columbia co-production The Electric Horseman, issued by MCA Disco Vision in both CAV and CLV formats, remains unavailable in any other home video format with its original score intact, with recent DVD releases featuring significant music replacements. Similarly, the MCA release of Universal's Howard the Duck displays only the start credits in widescreen before switching to a 4:3 aspect ratio for the remainder of the film. For an extended period, this was the sole disc-based version of the movie until widescreen DVD formats emerged with additional features. Notably, the LaserDisc release of E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial remains the only format containing the deleted scene featuring Harrison Ford as the school headmaster reprimanding Elliott for releasing frogs in the biology class.",
        "In southeast Europe, agrarian societies emerged in the 7th millennium BC, with one of Europe's earliest farming sites discovered in Vasht\u00ebmi, southeastern Albania, dating to 6,500 BC. Anthropomorphic figurines have been unearthed in the Balkans from 6000 BC and in Central Europe around 5800 BC (La Hoguette). The Sesklo culture in Thessaly stands among the earliest cultural complexes, which expanded in the Balkans and gave rise to Star\u010devo-K\u00f6r\u00f6s (Cris), Linearbandkeramik, and Vin\u010da cultures. Through cultural diffusion and population migrations, Neolithic traditions spread westward and northward, reaching northwestern Europe by approximately 4500 BC. The Vin\u010da culture potentially developed the earliest writing system, the Vin\u010da signs, though archaeologist Shan Winn suggests they were likely pictograms and ideograms rather than a fully developed writing form. The Cucuteni-Trypillian culture constructed massive settlements in Romania, Moldova, and Ukraine from 5300 to 2300 BC. The Mediterranean islands feature notable megalithic temple complexes, such as \u0120gantija on Gozo and Mnajdra in Malta, with the oldest structures dating to around 3600 BC. The Hypogeum of \u0126al-Saflieni in Paola, Malta, is a unique subterranean sanctuary-turned-necropolis from around 2500 BC, representing the world's only prehistoric underground temple. After 2500 BC, the Maltese Islands experienced depopulation until Bronze Age immigrants arrived, introducing a culture that cremated its dead and established smaller megalithic structures called dolmens. These structures typically feature small chambers covered by large slabs placed on upright stones, believed to have been introduced by a population likely originating from Sicily, as evidenced by the similarity to constructions found on the Mediterranean's largest island.",
        "For Popper, knowledge was objective in two dimensions: being objectively true and possessing an ontological status independent of the knowing subject. He conceptualized three distinct worlds: World One representing the physical realm and physical states; World Two encompassing the mental domain of ideas, thoughts, and perceptions; and World Three embodying the comprehensive body of human knowledge expressed through various forms, manifesting the products of World Two within World One's materials like books, artworks, and compositions. He argued that World Three emerges from individual human contributions similar to how animal paths are created by individual animals, thereby existing and evolving autonomously from individual knowing subjects. Popper believed World Three's influence on individual human minds (World Two) is at least as significant as World One's impact. Consequently, an individual's knowledge derives equally from the cumulative wealth of human knowledge as from direct experiential encounters. This perspective suggests that human knowledge's growth is fundamentally a function of World Three's independent evolutionary process. Despite this innovative framework, many contemporary philosophers, including Daniel Dennett, have been reluctant to embrace Popper's Three World theory, primarily due to its apparent resemblance to mind-body dualism.",
        "In the United Kingdom, the political structure that largely influenced the U.S. Constitution did not adhere to a strict separation of powers. The Westminster system, founded on parliamentary sovereignty and responsible government, positioned Parliament (comprising the Sovereign, House of Lords, and House of Commons) as the supreme legislative authority. The executive branch operated in the monarch's name, as did the judiciary. Typically, the King's Ministers were members of either parliamentary house, and the Government required majority support in the House of Commons. The Lord Chancellor uniquely served as both the sole judge in the Court of Chancery and the presiding officer in the House of Lords, demonstrating significant overlap between governmental branches. Despite frequent interdepartmental disagreements, the British governmental system often blurred the lines of power separation. Similarly, some 18th-century U.S. states did not strictly observe this principle. New Jersey's Governor simultaneously held positions in the state's highest court and legislature, while Delaware's President was a Court of Appeals member. Executive council members in Delaware and Pennsylvania also served as judges. Conversely, southern states like Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, and Georgia explicitly mandated a clear separation of governmental powers.",
        "Ottoman madaris encompassed various branches of study, including calligraphic, oral, and intellectual sciences, but fundamentally functioned as an Islamic centre for spiritual learning. The primary objective of knowledge, especially spiritual sciences, was to attain understanding of God. Religion predominantly determined the significance of each scientific discipline. As \u0130nalc\u0131k noted, sciences that supported religion were considered valuable, while those like astrology were deemed undesirable. Although mathematics and logic were part of the curriculum, they were invariably intertwined with religious principles. The Ulema believed that studying logic and mathematics was beneficial as it trained the mind to think correctly and ultimately reveal divine truths. Even philosophy was permitted only insofar as it could validate Islamic doctrines. Consequently, madaris were essentially religious institutions dedicated to Islamic teachings and learning. Despite scholars like Goffman arguing for Ottoman societal tolerance and pluralism, these educational centres were predominantly religious and Islam-centric rather than religiously diverse. This approach mirrored contemporary European practices, where Jewish and Protestant educational systems similarly prioritized religious instruction and values. Ultimately, Ottoman madaris offered a comprehensive educational experience, but their fundamental purpose remained the reinforcement and preservation of Islamic practices and theoretical frameworks.",
        "Thuringia boasts a remarkably varied topography. The far northern region is dominated by the Harz mountains, adjacent to the Goldene Aue, a rich floodplain near Nordhausen centered around the Helme river. The north-west encompasses the Eichsfeld, a rolling and partially wooded area where the Leine river originates. Central and northern Thuringia is characterized by the expansive 3000 km\u00b2 Thuringian Basin, a level and productive zone surrounding the Unstrut river, encircled by numerous hill ranges including D\u00fcn, Hainleite, Windleite, Kyffh\u00e4user, Hohe Schrecke, Schm\u00fccke, Finne, Ettersberg, Steigerwald, Thuringian Forest, H\u00f6rselberge, and Hainich, with smaller hill chains like Fahner H\u00f6he and Heilinger H\u00f6hen within its boundaries. South of the Basin lies the region's most significant mountain system, featuring the Thuringian Forest in the north-west, the Thuringian Highland centrally, and the Franconian Forest in the south-east. Predominantly forested, this range includes the Gro\u00dfer Beerberg, Thuringia's highest peak at 983 meters. The south-west transitions to the Werra river valley, separating the Rh\u00f6n Mountains and Grabfeld plain. Eastern Thuringia, east of the Saale and Loquitz valleys, presents a gradually ascending landscape from flat northern plains to southern mountainous terrain. The Saale and Wei\u00dfe Elster rivers flow northward, creating densely populated valleys. Between these rivers lie the flat, wooded Holzland in the north, the fertile Orlasenke in the middle, and the Vogtland, a mostly treeless hilly region in the south. The far eastern area, known as Osterland or Altenburger Land along the Plei\u00dfe river, is a flat, productive, and densely populated agricultural zone.",
        "During the 14th century, French monarchs aimed to enhance their power by reducing the territorial domains of the nobility. They encountered challenges when attempting to seize English-controlled lands in southern France, which ultimately triggered the Hundred Years' War from 1337 to 1453. In the war's early stages, the English, led by Edward III and his son Edward, the Black Prince, achieved significant victories by winning the battles of Cr\u00e9cy and Poitiers, capturing Calais, and gaining control over substantial French territories. These developments nearly caused the collapse of the French kingdom during the initial war years. The early 15th century saw France again approaching disintegration, but Joan of Arc's military achievements in the late 1420s ultimately led to French victory and the recapture of the final English possessions in southern France by 1453. The conflict exacted a tremendous human cost, with France's population likely reduced by half. Conversely, the war positively impacted English national identity, helping to consolidate local identities into a unified national concept and establishing a distinct English culture separate from French influence. The war also marked the emergence of the English longbow as a dominant military weapon and witnessed the introduction of cannon on the battlefield at Cr\u00e9cy in 1346.",
        "The Jurassic Period spans approximately 201.3 \u00b1 0.2 to 145.0 million years ago. During the early Jurassic, Pangaea fragmented into Laurasia in the north and Gondwana in the south, with the Gulf of Mexico emerging in the rift between North America and the Yucatan Peninsula. The North Atlantic was relatively narrow, while the South Atlantic remained closed until the Cretaceous Period when Gondwana began to separate. The Tethys Sea closed, giving rise to the Neotethys basin. Characterized by warm climates without glaciation, the period lacked polar landmasses and ice caps. Western Europe offers an extensive geological record, with marine sequences revealing a continent largely submerged under shallow tropical seas, including notable sites like the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site and the Holzmaden and Solnhofen lagerst\u00e4tten. In contrast, North America's Jurassic record is the least comprehensive of the Mesozoic, with limited surface outcrops. The Sundance Sea left marine deposits in parts of the northern United States and Canada, but most exposed sediments are continental, such as the Morrison Formation's alluvial deposits. The mid-Jurassic saw the first of several massive batholiths emplaced in the northern Cordillera, marking the Nevadan orogeny. Significant Jurassic exposures can also be found in Russia, India, South America, Japan, Australasia, and the United Kingdom.",
        "At airports, ground crew perform various tasks around aircraft. A tow tractor moves the aircraft to an airbridge, where a ground power unit is connected to provide electricity while the plane is stationary, since its engines are not generating power. Passengers disembark using the airbridge, with mobile stairs offering additional access to the cabin. A cleaning service thoroughly cleans the aircraft after landing. Flight catering supplies onboard food and drinks. A toilet waste truck removes human waste from the aircraft's holding tank, while a water truck replenishes the water tanks. A fuel transfer vehicle moves aviation fuel from underground tanks to the aircraft. Tractors with dollies transport luggage between the terminal and the aircraft. Hi-loaders lift heavy luggage containers to the cargo hold entrance, where ground crew push them in or out. For awkwardly shaped or late luggage, a conveyor belt truck handles transportation. New passengers board via the airbridge, and the tow tractor then pushes the aircraft to a taxi area. The goal is to have the aircraft off the airport and airborne within 90 minutes, with the airport billing the airline for the time spent on the ground.",
        "The pinnacle of leadership in Islam, the caliphate, was first claimed by Ottoman sultans beginning with Murad I, establishing the Ottoman Caliphate. The Ottoman sultan, known as p\u00e2di\u015f\u00e2h or \"lord of kings\", served as the Empire's supreme ruler and embodied its governmental structure, though not always exercising absolute power. The Imperial Harem emerged as a crucial center of influence within the Ottoman court, governed by the Valide Sultan. Occasionally, the Valide Sultan would intervene in state affairs, leading to a period when women effectively controlled the government, termed the \"Sultanate of Women\". Succession was strictly hereditary, with new sultans always selected from the sons of the previous ruler. The palace school's rigorous system aimed to identify suitable heirs and secure support from ruling elites. The educational institutions were divided into two primary tracks: the Madrasa, dedicated to Muslim education and training scholars and state officials according to Islamic traditions, supported by vakifs that enabled social mobility for children from poor families; and the Ender\u00fbn, a free boarding school for Christians that annually recruited 3,000 students aged eight to twenty through the Devshirme process, selecting one boy from every forty families in Rumelia and the Balkan communities.",

They discover the mirror is fragmented, and the Sages explain that Zant could only shatter it, as only the true ruler of the Twili can completely destroy it. The Sages reveal they previously used the mirror to banish Ganondorf, the Gerudo leader who attempted to steal the Triforce, after failing to execute him. With help from an underground resistance in Castle Town, Link and Midna retrieve the mirror's shards by defeating those infected. Upon restoring the portal, Midna is revealed as the true Twilight Realm ruler, whom Zant had usurped and cursed. When confronting Zant, they learn he made his coup possible by forming a pact with Ganondorf, who sought Zant's help in conquering Hyrule. After Link defeats Zant, Midna recovers the Fused Shadows and destroys Zant, realizing only Ganondorf's death can break her curse. Returning to Hyrule, they find Ganondorf in the castle with Zelda suspended lifeless above him. Ganondorf battles Link by possessing Zelda and later transforming into a beast, but Link ultimately defeats him, allowing Midna to resurrect Zelda.",
        "Jerusalem holds profound religious significance for Jews, Muslims, and Christians, housing crucial sacred sites within its Old City, including the Western Wall, Temple Mount, Al-Aqsa Mosque, and Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Israel contains numerous other religiously important locations, such as Nazareth (significant in Christianity as Mary's Annunciation site), Tiberias and Safed (two of Judaism's Four Holy Cities), the White Mosque in Ramla (an Islamic shrine of Prophet Saleh), and the Church of Saint George in Lod (revered in both Christianity and Islam as Saint George's tomb). The West Bank also hosts significant religious landmarks, including Joseph's Tomb in Nablus, Jesus's birthplace, Rachel's Tomb in Bethlehem, and the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron. Haifa serves as the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith's administrative center, housing the Shrine of the B\u00e1b, with the faith's leader buried in Acre. Despite having no permanent Bah\u00e1'\u00ed community beyond maintenance staff, the location remains a pilgrimage destination, with staff strictly prohibited from proselytizing to Israelis. Nearby, the Middle East centre of the Ahmadiyya movement exists in a unique mixed neighborhood of Jews and Ahmadi Arabs, representing the country's sole such community.",
        "Notre Dame underwent significant conference realignment in July 2013, affecting most of its sports except football and fencing, with fencing's affiliation set to change in July 2014. The university departed from the Big East for the ACC during a period of conference instability, maintaining football independence while committing to play five annual games against ACC opponents. In ice hockey, the team was compelled to seek a new conference following the Big Ten's decision to add the sport, which ultimately led to the Central Collegiate Hockey Association's dissolution after the 2012\u201313 season. Consequently, Notre Dame transferred its hockey program to Hockey East. Upon joining the ACC, the conference announced it would introduce fencing as a sponsored sport starting in the 2014\u201315 academic year. The Fighting Irish nickname, used for the football team since the early 1920s, was popularized by alumnus Francis Wallace through his New York Daily News columns. Navy Blue and Gold Rush serve as the official team colors, with green often incorporated due to the Fighting Irish moniker. The Notre Dame Leprechaun, designed by Theodore W. Drake in 1964, initially appeared on the football pocket schedule and program covers, and gained national recognition after being featured on the cover of Time in November 1964.",
        "In 1718, responding to a request from either Rector Samuel Andrew or Governor Gurdon Saltonstall, Cotton Mather reached out to Elihu Yale, a prosperous businessman residing in Wales who was originally from Boston and whose father was among New Haven's first settlers, seeking financial assistance for constructing a new college building. Persuaded by Jeremiah Dummer, Yale, who had amassed wealth trading in Madras as an East India Company representative, donated nine bales of goods that were sold for over \u00a3560, a considerable amount at the time. Cotton Mather proposed renaming the institution Yale College. Concurrently, a Harvard alumnus working in England convinced approximately 180 distinguished intellectuals to contribute books to Yale. The 1714 book shipment of 500 volumes represented the pinnacle of contemporary English literature, science, philosophy, and theology, profoundly influencing Yale's intellectuals. Undergraduate Jonathan Edwards discovered John Locke's writings and developed his groundbreaking \"new divinity\" theology. In 1722, the Rector and six colleagues from their study group announced their departure from Calvinism, embracing Arminianism and joining the Church of England. They were ordained in England and returned to the colonies as Anglican missionaries. Thomas Clapp became president in 1745 and endeavored to restore the college's Calvinist orthodoxy while preserving the library, where students continued to discover Deist literature.",
        "Despite attempts to revive Hebrew as the national language of the Jewish people, proficiency in the language remains limited among Jews globally, with English becoming the primary communication medium for the Jewish diaspora. While many Jews historically possessed sufficient Hebrew knowledge to engage with classical literature, and Jewish languages like Yiddish and Ladino were prevalent in the early 20th century, most Jews today lack such linguistic capabilities, with English largely replacing traditional Jewish vernaculars. Hebrew, English, and Russian currently represent the most widely spoken languages among Jews, with Romance languages such as French and Spanish also being commonly used. Historically, Yiddish has been the most spoken Jewish language, but its usage has significantly declined following the Holocaust and the emergence of Modern Hebrew through the Zionist movement and the establishment of Israel. In certain regions, the Jewish community's primary language differs from the dominant local language. For instance, Quebec's Ashkenazic majority uses English, while the Sephardic minority predominantly speaks French, and South African Jews have adopted English over Afrikaans. Czarist and Soviet policies have transformed Russian into the primary language for Jewish communities in post-Soviet states like Ukraine and Uzbekistan, as well as for Ashkenazic Jews in Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Tajikistan. Although North African Jewish communities have diminished, they previously transitioned to predominantly French-speaking populations in Algeria, Morocco, and Tunis, while the broader population continues to use Arabic.",
        "Galicia's human habitation dates back to the Middle Paleolithic period, deriving its name from the Gallaeci, Celtic peoples inhabiting the region north of the Douro river during the last millennium BC, an area largely corresponding to the Iron Age Castro culture. The Romans incorporated Galicia following the Cantabrian Wars in 19 BC, establishing it as a province in the 3rd century AD. In 410, the Germanic Suebi founded a kingdom centered in Braga, which was later absorbed by the Visigoth kingdom in 585. The Arab invasion of the Iberian Peninsula in 711 overthrew the Visigoth realm, but by 740, Galicia had been integrated into the Christian kingdom of Asturias. Throughout the Middle Ages, Galicia alternated between independent rule and alliance with the kingdoms of Leon and Castile, while preserving its distinct legal and cultural identity. From the 13th century, Castilian monarchs appointed an Adiantado-m\u00f3r, whose role evolved into the Governor and Captain General of Galicia by the late 15th century. This Governor also presided over the Royal Audiencia, a governmental tribunal. The kingdom's representation was maintained through the Cortes, an assembly of city deputies, until 1833 when the region was divided into four administrative provinces. The 19th and 20th centuries saw growing demands for self-governance and recognition of Galicia's unique character, culminating in the unsuccessful 1936 Autonomy Statute and the currently operative 1981 Autonomy Statute.",
        "Birds possess an exceptionally efficient oxygen diffusion system, with a gas exchange surface area ten times greater than mammals. Consequently, birds have a higher blood concentration in their capillaries relative to lung volume compared to mammals. The arteries feature thick, elastic muscles designed to endure ventricular constriction, becoming increasingly rigid as they extend from the heart. Blood traverses through arteries undergoing vasoconstriction and enters arterioles, which serve as a transportation network primarily distributing oxygen and nutrients to bodily tissues. As arterioles branch further from the heart and penetrate individual organs, they subdivide to enhance surface area and decelerate blood flow. Progressing through arterioles, blood enters capillaries where gas exchange occurs. These capillaries form organized beds within tissues, facilitating the exchange of oxygen for carbon dioxide waste. Blood flow in capillary beds is deliberately slowed to maximize oxygen diffusion into tissues. After becoming deoxygenated, blood moves through venules and veins back to the heart. Unlike arteries, veins are thin and less rigid due to reduced pressure requirements. During transit through venules to veins, vasodilation funnels blood homeward. Upon reaching the heart, blood first enters the right atrium, then the right ventricle, where it is pumped through the lungs for carbon dioxide and oxygen exchange. Oxygenated blood subsequently flows from the lungs through the left atrium to the left ventricle, from which it is pumped throughout the body.",
        "Roc-A-Fella released The College Dropout in February 2004, which quickly climbed to number two on the Billboard 200, with his debut single \"Through the Wire\" holding steady at number fifteen on the Billboard Hot 100 for five weeks. His second single, \"Slow Jamz\", featuring Twista and Jamie Foxx, became an even more significant hit, securing the trio's first number one track. The album received widespread critical praise, being named the top album of the year by two major music publications and consistently ranked among the most influential hip-hop debut albums. \"Jesus Walks\", the album's fourth single, potentially expanded West's audience by exploring themes of faith and Christianity, surprisingly reaching the top 20 of the Billboard pop charts despite industry skepticism about its religious content. The College Dropout ultimately achieved triple platinum certification in the US and earned West 10 Grammy nominations, including Album of the Year and Best Rap Album, which he won. During this period, West also established GOOD Music, a record label and management company that would support various artists and producers like No I.D. and John Legend. Initially known for using sped-up vocal samples from soul records, West began to shift his production style due to the technique's widespread imitation and his desire to explore new musical directions.",
        "As predicted by Nimitz, the Japanese fleet appeared near Midway on 4 June and was detected by PBY patrol planes. Nagumo launched an initial assault on Midway, while Fletcher dispatched his aircraft toward Nagumo's carriers. At 09:20, the first U.S. carrier aircraft, TBD Devastator torpedo bombers from Hornet, arrived but their attacks were uncoordinated and ineffective; hampered by defective aerial torpedoes, they failed to inflict any damage and were completely destroyed by defending Zero fighters. At 09:35, an additional 15 TBDs from Enterprise attacked, with 14 being shot down and no successful hits. Although Fletcher's attacks seemed disorganized and futile, they successfully drew Nagumo's defensive fighters to sea level, causing them to expend significant fuel and ammunition repelling the two torpedo bomber waves. Consequently, when U.S. dive bombers appeared at high altitude, the Zeros were poorly positioned to defend. Furthermore, Nagumo's four carriers had dispersed while attempting to evade torpedoes, which reduced their anti-aircraft fire's concentration. Nagumo's hesitation also generated confusion among his carriers. Aware of the need for a second Midway strike but concerned about the American carriers now in the area, Nagumo repeatedly changed his aircraft arming instructions. As a result, American dive bombers found the Japanese carriers with decks cluttered with munitions as crews frantically worked to re-arm their air groups.",
        "Vladimir was the prince of Novgorod when his father Sviatoslav I died in 972. In 976, he was compelled to escape to Scandinavia after his half-brother Yaropolk murdered Oleg and seized control of Rus. With assistance from his relative Earl H\u00e5kon Sigurdsson, the ruler of Norway, Vladimir gathered a Viking army and successfully reclaimed Novgorod and Kiev from Yaropolk. As the Prince of Kiev, his most significant accomplishment was the Christianization of Kievan Rus', which commenced in 988. According to the Primary Chronicle, when Vladimir decided to abandon the traditional Slavic idol-worship, he dispatched his most trusted advisors and warriors as emissaries across Europe. These representatives visited Christian, Jewish, and Muslim communities before reaching Constantinople. They dismissed Islam due to its alcohol prohibition and rejected Judaism because of the historical dispossession of the Jewish people. Finding the Roman church ceremonies unimpressive, they were profoundly moved by the Hagia Sophia's magnificence and the Byzantine liturgical service. Upon returning, they persuaded Vladimir that the Byzantine Rite was superior. Consequently, Vladimir traveled to Constantinople and arranged a marriage with Princess Anna, the sister of Byzantine emperor Basil II.",
        "Identity development is a crucial phase in the adolescent life cycle. Most individuals begin their search for identity during these formative years. Adolescents are particularly receptive to experimenting with various behaviors and appearances as they seek to understand themselves. Essentially, they tend to explore multiple identities in an attempt to find the one that best represents them. However, developing and maintaining identity during adolescence is challenging due to factors like family dynamics, environmental influences, and social context. Empirical research suggests this process is more accurately described as identity development, confirming a normative progression in the content and structure of self-perception. Self-clarity and self-esteem are the primary components of this developmental journey. The choices made during adolescence can significantly impact future life outcomes, with heightened self-awareness and self-control in mid-adolescence potentially leading to more informed decisions during the transition to adulthood. Researchers have approached identity development through three primary lenses: self-concept, sense of identity, and self-esteem. The adolescent years cultivate a more conscientious group of young adults who become increasingly attentive to their appearance as their bodies undergo transformation. Unlike children, teenagers make deliberate efforts to present themselves effectively. The environment in which an adolescent is raised plays a critical role in their identity development, with studies indicating that individuals from less privileged backgrounds may face greater challenges in establishing their sense of self.",
        "Athanasius describes his educational background, including learning from the Martyrs during the tenth and final pagan Roman persecution of Christianity. This persecution was most intense in the Eastern regions, especially Egypt and Palestine. Peter of Alexandria, the 17th archbishop, was martyred in 311 during the persecution's final days and potentially served as one of his teachers. Alexander of Alexandria, his successor as bishop (312\u2013328), was an Origenist and documented mentor. According to Sozomen, Bishop Alexander invited Athanasius to be his companion and secretary, recognizing his strong educational foundation in grammar and rhetoric, and acknowledging his wisdom and insight even as a young man. His earliest work, Against the Heathen \u2013 On the Incarnation, demonstrates Origenist Alexandrian thought through Platonic and Aristotelian references while maintaining orthodoxy. Athanasius was well-versed in various philosophical schools, particularly Neo-Platonism, and would later modify the Alexandrian School's philosophical approach away from purely allegorical interpretations. Interestingly, he continued to reference classical works, quoting Homer in later writings and displaying rhetorical skills reminiscent of Demosthenes in his correspondence with Emperor Constantius.",
        "During adolescence, egocentrism drives a self-conscious desire for importance and social acceptance within peer groups. While self-concept can be conflicting, identity represents a stable and coherent sense of self that encompasses past experiences and future aspirations. Although everyone possesses a self-concept, Erik Erikson argued that not all individuals fully develop a comprehensive identity. His developmental theory highlights the identity crisis, where adolescents must explore various possibilities and integrate different aspects of themselves before establishing firm beliefs. Erikson characterized the resolution of this process as \"identity achievement\" while emphasizing that the identity challenge is an ongoing, dynamic process. Adolescents initially define themselves through group membership, with fashion serving as a critical tool for exploring new identities, separating from parental influence, and connecting with peers. As fashion continually evolves, it mirrors the transformative nature of teenage personality development. Teenagers consciously experiment with different styles to discover their authentic selves, using trial and error to align their perceived image with external perceptions. Simultaneously, media bombardment with visual imagery consciously and subconsciously impacts self-image, further influencing identity formation. Researcher James Marcia developed a method for assessing individual progress through identity stages, employing questions about occupation, ideology, and interpersonal relationships. By evaluating exploration and commitment levels, individuals are classified into four categories: identity diffusion, identity foreclosure, moratorium, and identity achievement.",
        "Stanley Schachter developed his theory based on the research of Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n, a Spanish physician who administered epinephrine to patients and inquired about their feelings. Mara\u00f1\u00f3n discovered that while patients experienced physiological sensations, they struggled to interpret these sensations as emotions without a corresponding emotional trigger. Schachter concurred that physiological responses were crucial to emotional experiences, proposing that these reactions enabled a focused cognitive assessment of a physiologically stimulating event, which ultimately defined the subjective emotional experience. He viewed emotions as a two-stage process involving general physiological arousal and emotional interpretation. For instance, when encountering a bear in the kitchen, the physiological response of a pounding heart prompts the brain to scan the environment and recognize the threat, thereby interpreting the heightened heart rate as fear. Collaborating with Jerome Singer, Schachter demonstrated that individuals can exhibit different emotional responses despite being in the same physiological state after receiving an epinephrine injection. Subjects' emotional expressions varied based on the emotional display of another person present in the situation. The emotional response was determined by the combination of situational appraisal and the participants' physiological state, whether receiving adrenaline or a placebo. This experimental approach has been critiqued by Jesse Prinz in his 2004 work, \"Gut Reactions.\"",
        "Hong Taiji's administrative system incorporated numerous Han Chinese, including many recently surrendered Ming officials. The Manchus maintained their supremacy through an ethnic quota for senior bureaucratic positions. During his reign, Hong Taiji significantly transformed policies toward Han Chinese subjects. Previously, Nurhaci had differentiated treatment of Han in Liaodong based on grain ownership, with those possessing less than 5 to 7 sin considered essentially property, while those with more were granted land rights. Following a Han revolt in 1623, Nurhaci abandoned previous concessions, implementing discriminatory policies and violent suppression. He distinguished between conquered Han in Liaodong and those who had assimilated with Jurchens in Jilin before 1619, who were to be treated equally. Hong Taiji instead fully integrated these populations into the Jurchen \"nation\" as citizens with military service obligations. By 1648, Manchu ancestry comprised less than one-sixth of bannermen. This policy shift expanded his military capacity, reduced dependence on external banner units, and strategically encouraged Ming subjects to surrender and accept Jurchen governance. Through such measures, Hong Taiji centralized power within the Khan's office, ultimately preventing potential fragmentation of the Jurchen federation after his death.",
        "CNET's tech media review awarded the Super Slim PlayStation 3 4 out of 5 stars (\"Excellent\"), praising its ability to compress a powerful gaming system into an even more compact form while preserving the gaming library and streaming services of previous models. However, the review also highlighted significant design drawbacks, particularly criticizing the disc-loader mechanism as feeling \"cheap\" and reminiscent of outdated credit card imprinters. The review noted the inconvenience of the manual disc tray compared to auto-loading designs, suggesting this was potentially a cost-cutting or space-saving measure that represented a backward step. The critique extended to pricing, pointing out that the cheapest Super Slim model was more expensive than the Slim model, and arguing that the smaller size and larger hard drive did not constitute a meaningful upgrade. Despite these criticisms, the review positively noted the hard drive's accessibility, describing its removal as the easiest yet\u2014simply sliding off a side panel reveals the drive bay. Ultimately, while not considering the Super Slim revolutionary, the review suggested it might signal future design directions. The conclusion was that existing PS3 owners need not upgrade, but prospective buyers might find the Super Slim attractive, provided they can accept the manual disc-loading mechanism.",
        "Y DNA research suggests a limited number of founders in an ancient population who dispersed and pursued different migration routes. Most Jewish populations show male line ancestors predominantly originating from the Middle East. Ashkenazi Jews, for instance, exhibit more shared paternal lineages with Jewish and Middle Eastern groups than with non-Jewish populations in Eastern Europe, Germany, and the French Rhine Valley, aligning with Jewish historical traditions about paternal origins. Mitochondrial DNA studies reveal more diverse maternal lineages, with scholars like Harry Ostrer and Raphael Falk proposing that Jewish males often formed partnerships with women from European and other communities during diaspora migrations. Conversely, Behar's research indicates approximately 40% of Ashkenazi Jews maternally descend from four female founders of Middle Eastern origin. Sephardi and Mizrahi Jewish communities demonstrated no evidence of a narrow founder effect. Subsequent investigations by Feder et al. confirmed the substantial proportion of non-local maternal origins among Ashkenazi Jews. Reflecting on their findings, the researchers concluded that genetic differences between Jews and non-Jews are significantly more pronounced than variations among Jewish communities themselves.",
        "The state rallied behind the Plan of Ayutla and endorsed the new constitution in 1855. It weathered the Reform War with minimal disruption, largely due to its significant liberal political leadership. Despite the conservative Zuloaga's military campaign that occupied Chihuahua and Parral with 1,000 men in 1858, the conservative movement failed to gain traction. In August 1859, Zuloaga's forces were defeated by liberal Orozco, who subsequently removed the state governor but was forced to retreat to Durango two months later. During the late 1860s, conservative General Cajen briefly entered the state after his Jalisco campaign, establishing conservative politicians and driving out liberal leaders Jes\u00fas Gonz\u00e1lez Ortega and Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Patoni. Cajen seized the state capital, declared himself governor, and quickly assembled a force to combat liberal troops, defeating them in La Batalla del Gallo. Although Cajen initially gained advantages, he soon lost ground due to a robust liberal resurgence. Liberal leaders Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Patoni from Durango and J.E. Mu\u00f1oz from Chihuahua strengthened their position by restricting clergy political rights through a presidential decree. The state ultimately elected General Luis Terrazas, a liberal leader, as governor, who continued to suppress conservative uprisings throughout 1861.",
        "In modern society, adolescents encounter various risks as their sexuality evolves. While some challenges like emotional distress and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV/AIDS, are not exclusive to adolescence, others such as teenage pregnancy are considered significant social issues in Western cultures. Approximately 25% of sexually active teenagers will contract an STI. Many U.S. adolescents engage in alternative sexual activities, mistakenly believing this reduces infection risks. Clinicians are observing increased diagnoses of herpes and human papillomavirus (HPV), which affects around 15% of teenagers and can cause genital warts. Females aged 15-19 exhibit the highest gonorrhea rates, and individuals under 21 account for one-quarter of new HIV cases. A Kaiser Family Foundation survey revealed that 81% of parents want schools to discuss condom use and contraception, and support STI testing for students. Similarly, educators desire to address these topics, with 90% of sex education instructors believing contraceptive education is essential. However, over 25% report being explicitly prohibited from doing so by school administrators. Anthropologist Margaret Mead suggested that adolescent turmoil in Western society stems from cultural rather than physiological factors, noting that societies with more sexually liberated young women experience less adolescent conflict.",
        "The ancestral demographic composition of Bermuda's population has been increasingly blurred by ethnic convergence over the past four centuries. Currently, there is virtually no ethnic differentiation between black and white Bermudians, apart from recent immigrant communities. In the 17th century, the landscape was markedly different. During the initial hundred years of settlement, white Protestant English settlers predominated, accompanied by white minorities of Irish (many likely Gaelic-speaking) and Scots who arrived following the English Civil War's invasions of their homelands. The non-white population comprised Spanish-speaking free blacks from the West Indies, black chattel slaves primarily captured from Spanish and Portuguese vessels by Bermudian privateers, and Native Americans from Algonquian and other Atlantic seaboard tribes, potentially including individuals from as far as Mexico. By the 19th century, ethnically English white Bermudians had lost their numerical superiority. Despite efforts to restrict Irish immigration and forcibly remove free blacks and slave owners, the intermingling of various minority groups and some white English settlers created a new demographic category of \"coloured\" Bermudians, who gained a slight majority. Any child born to a mixed coloured and white parentage was categorized as coloured. Most historically classified as \"coloured\" are now described as \"black\" or \"of African heritage\", which obscures their diverse ancestral backgrounds. While blacks have maintained their majority status, new white immigration from Portugal, Britain, and elsewhere has been balanced by black immigration from the West Indies.",
        "The immune system's response to antigens varies based on factors such as age, antigen characteristics, maternal influences, and presentation site. Neonates experience physiological immunodeficiency, with both innate and adaptive immune responses significantly suppressed. Upon birth, infants demonstrate a more favorable immune reaction to protein antigens compared to glycoproteins and polysaccharides. Notably, neonates are prone to infections from low virulence organisms like Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas. Their opsonic activity and complement cascade activation are severely limited, with newborns' C3 levels reaching only approximately 65% of adult levels. Phagocytic capabilities are substantially impaired due to reduced opsonic activity and diminished integrin and selectin receptor up-regulation, which restricts neutrophils' interaction with endothelial adhesion molecules. Neonatal monocytes exhibit slower movement and decreased ATP production, further compromising phagocytic efficiency. Despite having a higher total lymphocyte count than adults, cellular and humoral immunity remains weakened. Antigen-presenting cells in newborns have reduced T cell activation potential, and their T cells proliferate poorly, producing minimal cytokines like IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-12, and IFN-g. This limitation inhibits both humoral response and macrophage phagocytic activity. While B cells develop early during gestation, they remain incompletely functional.",
        "Throughout the 1990s, several established rock bands maintained their commercial prominence. Aerosmith achieved significant success with multi-platinum albums like Get a Grip (1993) and Nine Lives (1997), with the former selling over 10 million copies and producing four Top 40 singles. Their 1998 hit \"I Don't Want to Miss a Thing\" became the first hard rock single to debut at number one. AC/DC released the double platinum Ballbreaker (1995), while Bon Jovi diversified their sound with rock tracks like \"Keep the Faith\" (1992) and adult contemporary ballads such as \"Bed of Roses\" (1993) and \"Always\" (1994). Their 1995 album These Days performed particularly well in Europe. Metallica explored a more melodic blues rock approach with Load (1996) and ReLoad (1997), each selling over 4 million copies in the US. As grunge's initial momentum waned, post-grunge bands like Foo Fighters, Candlebox, Live, Collective Soul, Silverchair, and Bush emerged, offering a more radio-friendly hard rock sound. Similarly, post-Britpop bands such as Feeder and Stereophonics adopted hard rock and pop-metal influences, solidifying the genre's commercial viability by the decade's end.",
        "A government report published by the Guardian in 2002 revealed that between 1940 and 1979, the Ministry of Defence effectively transformed substantial areas of the country into an experimental site for covert biological warfare trials, releasing potentially hazardous chemicals and microorganisms across extensive population zones without public awareness. While the Ministry of Defence maintains that these experiments were designed to simulate germ warfare scenarios and were fundamentally safe, affected families have reported increased incidents of birth defects and physical and mental disabilities, prompting calls for a comprehensive public investigation. The report suggests these trials impacted an estimated millions of individuals, with a particularly notable period from 1961 to 1968 when over a million residents along England's southern coastline were exposed to bacteria like e.coli and bacillus globigii, which can mimic anthrax characteristics. Two Ministry of Defence-commissioned scientists asserted that these trials presented no public risk, a stance echoed by Sue Ellison from Porton Down, who argued that such research could potentially save lives during chemical or biological weapon attacks. When questioned about ongoing research, Ellison cryptically stated that discussing current activities was not their policy. The ultimate determination of the trials' safety at the time remains uncertain.",
        "Similar to reptiles, birds are primarily uricotelic, meaning their kidneys remove nitrogenous waste from the bloodstream and excrete it as uric acid rather than urea or ammonia through the ureters into the intestine. Birds lack a urinary bladder and external urethral opening, and (except for ostriches) uric acid is expelled alongside feces as a semisolid waste. Nonetheless, birds like hummingbirds can be facultatively ammonotelic, excreting most nitrogenous wastes as ammonia. They also excrete creatine instead of creatinine, which mammals produce. This material, along with intestinal output, emerges from the bird's cloaca, a multi-purpose opening used for waste expulsion, mating, and egg-laying in females. Many bird species additionally regurgitate pellets. Males within Palaeognathae (excluding kiwis), Anseriformes (except screamers), and in rudimentary forms in Galliformes (but fully developed in Cracidae) possess a penis, which is absent in Neoaves. The penis length is believed to correlate with sperm competition and remains hidden within the proctodeum compartment of the cloaca when not in use. Birds have a distinctive digestive system featuring a crop for storage and a gizzard containing swallowed stones to grind food, compensating for the absence of teeth. Most birds are highly adapted for rapid digestion to support flight, with some migratory species capable of utilizing protein from various body parts, including intestinal protein, as additional energy during migration.",
        "The dismissal of Maxim Litvinov, whose Jewish background was viewed negatively by Nazi Germany, is widely considered by historians as a pivotal moment in Soviet diplomatic maneuvering. Stalin promptly instructed Molotov to cleanse the ministry of Jewish personnel. Litvinov's previous efforts to establish an anti-fascist coalition and his pro-Western orientation made his removal a clear indication of a potential Soviet rapprochement with Germany. Molotov's appointment simultaneously signaled Germany's receptiveness to negotiations and conveyed to France and Britain the possibility of alternative diplomatic paths. A British official noted Litvinov's departure as the loss of an effective diplomatic buffer, while describing Molotov's approach as more authentically Bolshevik. Historian E.H. Carr interpreted the foreign minister's replacement not as an irreversible shift towards German alignment, but as Stalin's strategic negotiation tactic. Albert Resis suggested that Litvinov's dismissal provided the Soviets greater flexibility in German negotiations without abandoning talks with Britain and France. Derek Watson argued that Molotov could potentially secure better terms with Western powers due to his lack of attachment to previous collective security doctrines. Geoffrey Roberts further posited that Litvinov's removal actually facilitated Soviet discussions with Britain and France, given his skepticism toward such negotiations.",
        "The Guangxu Emperor passed away on November 14, 1908, with Cixi following him in death on November 15, 1908. Speculation persisted that either Cixi or Yuan Shikai had instructed trusted eunuchs to poison the Guangxu Emperor, a theory later substantiated by an autopsy nearly a century later, which revealed fatal arsenic levels in his remains. Puyi, the eldest son of Zaifeng, Prince Chun, and nephew to the childless Guangxu Emperor, was designated as successor at the tender age of two, with Zaifeng assuming the regency. This appointment was accompanied by the dismissal of General Yuan Shikai from his previous positions of authority. In April 1911, Zaifeng established a cabinet featuring two vice-premiers, which contemporaries dubbed \"The Royal Cabinet\" due to five of its thirteen members being from the imperial family or Aisin Gioro clan, drawing criticism from senior officials like Zhang Zhidong. The Wuchang Uprising on October 10, 1911, precipitated the formation of a new central government, the Republic of China, in Nanjing under Sun Yat-sen's provisional leadership. Numerous provinces subsequently began distancing themselves from Qing control. Recognizing the deteriorating situation, the Qing government reinstated Yuan Shikai's military power, enabling him to deploy his Beiyang Army to suppress the revolution in Wuhan during the Battle of Yangxia. After assuming the role of Prime Minister and forming his own cabinet, Yuan Shikai demanded Zaifeng's removal from the regency, a request ultimately executed under Empress Dowager Longyu's directive.",
        "During his youth, Schwarzenegger was deeply involved in sports, primarily influenced by his father. His introduction to weightlifting occurred in 1960 when his soccer coach brought the team to a local gym. By age 14, he committed to bodybuilding over soccer as his primary pursuit. While he has given varying accounts of his early training, he generally acknowledges starting serious weight training around age 15. His official biography suggests he began an intensive training program with Dan Farmer at 14, studied psychology at 15 to understand mind-body connections, and launched his competitive career at 17. Schwarzenegger's personal aspirations diverged from his parents' expectations, who wanted him to become a police officer or attend trade school. He frequently visited gyms in Graz and local movie theaters, drawing inspiration from bodybuilding icons like Reg Park, Steve Reeves, and Johnny Weissmuller. Reeves particularly influenced him, with Schwarzenegger later crediting him for expanding his perception of potential achievements. In 1961, he met Kurt Marnul, who invited him to train at a Graz gym. His dedication was so intense that he would break into the gym on weekends to continue training, driven by an unwavering commitment to his fitness goals. Regarding his early cinematic experiences, Schwarzenegger recalled accompanying his father to Austrian theaters and watching newsreels, with his first memorable film being a John Wayne production.",
        "In the 1930s, Thuringia saw the construction of its first two motorways: the A4, a crucial east-west route connecting Berlin with south-west Germany, and the A9, the primary north-south highway in eastern Germany linking Berlin to Munich. The A4 traverses from Frankfurt in Hesse through key Thuringian cities like Eisenach, Gotha, Erfurt, Weimar, Jena, and Gera, ultimately reaching Dresden in Saxony. At the Hermsdorf junction, it intersects with the A9. Post-1990, both highways were expanded from four to six lanes, involving significant rerouting near Eisenach and Jena.\n\nThe 1990s and 2000s saw the addition of three new motorways. The A71 crosses the region southwest to northeast, connecting W\u00fcrzburg in Bavaria with Sangerhausen and Halle in Saxony-Anhalt, passing through cities like Meiningen, Suhl, Ilmenau, Arnstadt, Erfurt, and S\u00f6mmerda. Its path through the Thuringian Forest is notably expensive, featuring numerous tunnels, including Germany's longest road tunnel, the Rennsteig Tunnel. The A73 begins south of Erfurt in Suhl and heads towards Nuremberg, while the A38 provides another west-east connection in northern Thuringia, linking G\u00f6ttingen in Lower Saxony with Leipzig in Saxony.\n\nComplementing the motorway network is a comprehensive system of federal highways. The federal trunk road programme 2015 prioritizes highway upgrades, with planned improvements including the B247 from Gotha to Leinefelde, the B19 from Eisenach to Meiningen, and the B88 and B281 to enhance connectivity in the Saalfeld/Rudolstadt region.",
        "Public priests were designated by the collegia. Once chosen, a priest held perpetual religious authority from the divine eternal, granting him lifelong influence, privilege, and immunity. Consequently, both civil and religious regulations restricted the number and type of religious offices permissible for an individual and his family. Religious law was collegial and traditional, influencing political decisions, potentially overturning them, and resisting personal exploitation. Priesthood was an expensive honor: in traditional Roman practice, priests received no salary. Cult donations belonged to the deity, and the priest was obligated to maintain the cult despite potential funding shortfalls, potentially requiring personal financial support for acolytes and cult maintenance. For those who had completed the Cursus honorum, permanent priesthood was ideally pursued or granted after a lifetime of military or political service, or preferably both: it represented an honorable and active form of retirement fulfilling a crucial public responsibility. For freedmen or slaves, appointment as Compitalia seviri offered enhanced local visibility and opportunities in local politics and business. During the Imperial era, Imperial cult priesthood provided provincial elites full Roman citizenship and public prominence beyond their annual religious office, effectively serving as the initial step in a provincial cursus honorum. In Rome, the Arval Brethren performed a similar Imperial cult role, transforming from an obscure Republican priesthood to an Augustus-co-opted institution. The Arvals offered prayers and sacrifices to Roman state gods at various temples, ensuring the Imperial family's welfare during birthdays, accession anniversaries, and significant events like suppressing conspiracies or revolts. Annually on January 3, they consecrated vows and fulfilled previous year's sacrificial promises, contingent on the gods protecting the Imperial family.",
        "When Nintendo launched the NES in the United States, its design was intentionally distinctive, setting it apart from other gaming systems. The company aimed to differentiate its product from competitors and counter the negative perception of game consoles following the 1983 video game crash. As part of this strategy, Nintendo implemented a front-loading zero insertion force (ZIF) cartridge socket that mimicked a VCR's loading mechanism. Initially, the connector performed effectively when both the connector and cartridges were pristine and the pins were new. However, the ZIF design was not truly zero insertion force. Inserting a cartridge required pressing it down, which slightly bent the contact pins and pushed the ROM board back into the cartridge. Repeated cartridge insertions and removals gradually wore out the pins, and the design proved more susceptible to dirt and dust interference compared to standard card edge connectors. Nintendo's material choices further complicated the issue, with nickel connector springs deteriorating and copper cartridge connectors prone to tarnishing. Many players attempted to resolve game performance problems by blowing into cartridges and reinserting them, a method that paradoxically accelerated copper connector corrosion.",
        "In Homer's Iliad, the terms Danaans and Argives are used to refer to the Greek forces fighting against the Trojans. The myth of Danaus, originating from Egypt, serves as a foundational legend for Argos. His daughters, the Danaides, were condemned in Tartarus to endlessly attempt filling a bottomless bathtub. This myth is associated with an impossible task, similar to Sisyphos, and the name potentially derives from the Proto-Indo-European root meaning \"river\". The origin of the Danaans remains unclear, with some scholars linking them to the Denyen, a group among the sea peoples who attacked Egypt during Ramesses III's reign. The same inscription mentions the Weshesh, potentially identifying them as Achaeans. The Denyen appear to have been residents of Adana in Cilicia. Archaeological evidence shows Mycenaean-style pottery in Tarsus, suggesting Aegean refugees settled there after the Mycenaean civilization's collapse. These Cilicians were reportedly called Dananiyim, identical to the Danaoi who attacked Egypt in 1191 BC alongside the Quaouash or Weshesh. Hittite inscriptions and Amarna letters also reference them as Danuna. Linguistic reconstructions suggest connections to roots meaning \"flow,\" \"liquid,\" and \"river-dwelling people.\" The possibility of a pre-Greek origin remains, with Egyptian inscriptions from Amenophis III and Thutmosis III mentioning a country Danaja and a city Mukana, likely referring to Mycenae.",
        "Researchers like C. Loring Brace, Jonathan Kaplan, Rasmus Winther, and Joseph Graves argue that while biological and genetic variations can correspond to broadly defined \"continental races\", such variations exist in nearly all geographically distinct populations. The genetic data's cluster structure depends heavily on the researcher's initial hypotheses and the populations selected for study. Different sampling approaches would yield different clustering results. As Weiss and Fullerton demonstrated, sampling only Icelanders, Mayans, and Maoris would create three distinct clusters, with all other populations potentially described as genetic admixtures of these groups. Kaplan and Winther suggest that both Lewontin and Edwards have valid points in their arguments. They conclude that while racial groups exhibit different allele frequencies, this does not establish racial classification as a natural human species taxonomy, since multiple genetic patterns exist that transcend racial boundaries. Furthermore, genomic data does not definitively support either subdivision or continuum perspectives. From their viewpoint, racial groupings are objective social constructions with conventional biological significance only when created for specific scientific purposes. Winther previously distinguished between \"diversity partitioning\" and \"clustering analysis\" as separate methodological approaches, each with unique questions, assumptions, protocols, and contrasting ontological implications regarding race's metaphysical nature.",
        "The U.S. dollar operates on a decimal value system, unlike the Spanish milled dollar. The Coinage Act established monetary units including the mill (\u20a5) at one-thousandth of a dollar, cent (\u00a2) at one-hundredth of a dollar, dime at one-tenth of a dollar, and eagle at ten dollars, with specific weights and compositions of gold, silver, or copper. A proposal in the mid-1800s suggested a $100 \"union\" coin, but only patterns for the $50 half union were created. In practice, only cents are commonly used as dollar divisions; \"dime\" refers specifically to the 10\u00a2 coin, while \"eagle\" and \"mill\" are largely unknown to the public, though mills occasionally appear in tax calculations and gasoline pricing. Currently, coins are issued for denominations at or below a dollar, while denominations at or above a dollar are produced as Federal Reserve notes, with exceptions for precious metal coins valued up to $100. Both dollar coins and notes are in circulation, with notes being more prevalent. Historically, paper money was sometimes issued in fractional denominations, and gold coins circulated up to $20. The term \"eagle\" originated in the 1792 Coinage Act for ten-dollar coins, and fractional currency was sometimes derisively called \"shinplasters\". In 1854, Treasury Secretary James Guthrie proposed gold coins of $100, $50, and $25, termed \"Union\", \"Half Union\", and \"Quarter Union\" respectively.",
        "During the London torch relay, Sir Steve Redgrave, who initiated the event, revealed receiving emails urging a boycott and understanding the potential controversy. Some torch-bearers like Francesca Martinez and Richard Vaughan declined participation, while Konnie Huq chose to carry the torch and critique China. Member of Parliament Norman Baker encouraged bearers to reconsider their involvement. Prime Minister Gordon Brown greeted the torch at 10 Downing Street without direct contact. The BBC described the torch as being surrounded by a \"mobile protective ring,\" and protests erupted immediately, resulting in at least thirty-five arrests. A demonstrator attempted to seize the torch from Huq in Ladbroke Grove, and a fire extinguisher was discharged nearby. The Chinese ambassador navigated through Chinatown after a discreet route modification due to security issues. The torch was hastily moved onto a bus along Fleet Street to avoid protesters. Counteracting pro-Tibet demonstrations, over 2,000 Chinese supporters gathered along the route, displaying signs, banners, and flags. A significant concentration of supporters assembled in Trafalgar Square, prominently displaying the Olympic slogan \"One World, One Dream\".",
        "Several hard rock bands from the 1970s and 1980s maintained commercial relevance into the 2000s. Bon Jovi scored a hit with \"It's My Life\" from their platinum album Crush (2000), while AC/DC released the platinum Stiff Upper Lip (2000). Aerosmith put out the number two platinum album Just Push Play (2001), featuring the Top 10 hit \"Jaded\" and exploring pop sounds, followed by the blues cover album Honkin' on Bobo in 2004. Heart achieved their first Top 10 album since the early 90s with Red Velvet Car in 2010, becoming the first female-led hard rock band to chart Top 10 albums across five decades. Various bands reunited, including Van Halen (with Hagar in 2004 and Roth in 2007), The Who (touring from 2006), and Black Sabbath (with Osbourne 1997\u20132006 and Dio 2006\u20132010), with Led Zeppelin performing a one-off show in 2007. Hard rock supergroups like Audioslave and Velvet Revolver emerged briefly, experiencing some success before dissolving by 2008. Guns N' Roses released the long-awaited Chinese Democracy in 2008, though it only went platinum and fell short of their earlier success. AC/DC found more success with the double platinum Black Ice (2008). Bon Jovi expanded their reach by crossing into country music with the chart-topping \"Who Says You Can't Go Home\" and the rock/country album Lost Highway in 2007, followed by The Circle in 2009, which marked a return to their hard rock roots.",
        "Contemporary wrestling features numerous specialty matches with distinctive victory parameters. The ladder match stands out as the most prevalent. In this format, wrestlers or teams must ascend a ladder to retrieve a suspended prize, strategically incapacitating opponents to create an opportunity for one wrestler to secure the reward. The ladder itself becomes a potential weapon during the contest. Potential prizes range from championship belts to documents granting future title shots or other significant rewards meaningful to the participants. Another popular variant is the battle royal, where 20-30 wrestlers simultaneously compete to eliminate opponents by forcing them over the top rope, with both feet touching the floor. The final wrestler remaining is declared the victor. The WWE's Royal Rumble offers a unique twist, where two wrestlers initially enter the ring, with additional competitors joining at 90-second intervals until 30-40 wrestlers have entered. The fundamental elimination rules remain consistent throughout the match, creating an intense and dynamic competitive environment.",
        "By March 2011, OS X's market share in North America had grown to just over 14%. The significance of the Mac's market share and installed base remains a contentious topic. Tech commentators have frequently used the Mac's limited market presence to forecast Apple's potential downfall, especially during the challenging early and mid-1990s. Conversely, some argue that market share is an inappropriate metric for evaluating the Mac's performance. Apple has strategically positioned the Mac as a premium personal computer, making direct comparisons with budget PCs potentially misleading. The rapidly expanding personal computer market means that while Mac sales are increasing, they are proportionally overshadowed by the industry's overall growth. This can create a misleading impression that fewer people are using Macs compared to a decade earlier, when the opposite is true. The explosive popularity of iPhone and iPad sales caused the Macintosh's proportion of Apple's profits to decline from 46% to 24% in 2010. Some argue that market share is rarely discussed in other industries. Despite its market share, Apple has maintained profitability since Steve Jobs' return and subsequent company restructuring. A 2008 report notably revealed that Apple held 14% of the US personal computer market, including an impressive 66% of computers priced over $1,000, with market research indicating the brand attracts a higher-income customer demographic.",
        "The 1998 season began with a heavy heart following the passing of iconic broadcaster Harry Caray. After Sandberg's retirement and Dunston's trade, the Cubs addressed lineup gaps by signing Henry Rodr\u00edguez, nicknamed \"H-Rod,\" who provided protection for Sammy Sosa by hitting 31 home runs in his debut Chicago season. Kevin Tapani led the team with a career-best 19 wins, Rod Beck stabilized the bullpen, and Mark Grace delivered an outstanding performance. Media attention surrounded the Cubs, with Sosa and rookie Kerry Wood emerging as the team's focal points. Wood's remarkable one-hitter against the Houston Astros, where he matched the major league record of 20 strikeouts, earned him the \"Kid K\" moniker and the 1998 NL Rookie of the Year award. Sosa's June surge included a record-breaking 20 home runs, sparking an electrifying home run race with Mark McGwire that catapulted them to international stardom. McGwire finished with 70 home runs, but Sosa's .308 average and 66 homers secured the National League MVP. A nail-biting Wild Card chase with San Francisco ended in a tie-breaking playoff at Wrigley Field, where Gary Gaetti's homer propelled the Cubs to a 90-73 season. However, their postseason appearance was short-lived, as they were swept by Atlanta while batting a mere .183. The home run chase between Sosa, McGwire, and Ken Griffey, Jr. revitalized baseball's fan base following the 1994 strike. Despite retaining their 1998 performers, the Cubs struggled in 1999, starting with a sweep by the White Sox and finishing at the bottom of the division for the next two seasons.",
        "The university's physical infrastructure has expanded significantly since its earliest structures were built. Over time, 29 residence halls have been constructed, each featuring its own chapel. Academic facilities have been added alongside a comprehensive library system, with the Theodore Hesburgh Library, established in 1963, now housing nearly 4 million volumes. Since 2004, several notable buildings have been introduced, including the DeBartolo Performing Arts Center, the Guglielmino Complex, and the Jordan Hall of Science. Duncan Hall, a new men's residence, began welcoming residents in Fall 2008, while Ryan Hall opened for undergraduate women in 2009. Recent additions include the Stinson-Remick Engineering Hall, Geddes Hall for Social Concerns and Church Life, and a law school expansion. A new hockey arena was inaugurated in 2011, and the Stayer Center for Executive Education opened in March 2013 near the Mendoza College of Business. Reflecting the university's strong athletic heritage, numerous sports facilities have been developed. Notre Dame Stadium, home to the Fighting Irish football team, has undergone multiple renovations and now accommodates over 80,000 spectators. Other prominent venues include the Edmund P. Joyce Center, featuring indoor basketball and volleyball courts, and the Compton Family Ice Arena, a two-rink hockey facility.

        "Comic book narratives have incorporated samurai-themed characters, such as Marvel Comics' mutant-villain Silver Samurai, who maintains a traditional warrior aesthetic. The character appears in over 350 comic book issues and is featured in video games like Marvel Vs. Capcom 1 and 2. In 2013, the Silver Samurai was portrayed in James Mangold's film The Wolverine. A decade earlier, The Last Samurai introduced American audiences to samurai culture through a different lens. Starring Tom Cruise, the 2003 film follows US Army Captain Nathan Algren, who travels to Japan during the Meiji Period to train a new army against samurai rebel groups. After being captured by these rebels, Algren becomes sympathetic to their cause and eventually integrates into their culture. Through his transformation, he develops a deep understanding of samurai principles, including sword mastery and spiritual awareness. The film serves as a narrative device to make nineteenth-century Japanese history more accessible to American viewers, presenting a fictionalized account of cultural immersion and personal transformation.",
        "A true predator is typically characterized by killing and consuming another living organism. Unlike other predatory forms that merely harm their prey, this type definitively ends the prey's life. Predators employ various hunting strategies, such as active pursuit or waiting in ambush for potential victims. Some predators, like jaguars or humans, kill large prey and dismember it before eating, while others, such as bottlenose dolphins, snakes, ducks, or storks, swallow smaller prey whole. Certain animals, like domestic cats and dogs, adapt their predation technique based on prey size, potentially devouring an insect whole or systematically dismembering a rabbit. Some predators use venom to subdue or disable prey, as seen in box jellyfish and cone shells. In certain cases, like with rattlesnakes and some spiders, venom assists in prey digestion before consumption. Occasionally, prey may die within the predator's digestive system, as exemplified by baleen whales consuming massive quantities of plankton. Seed and egg predation are also considered true predation, as these represent potential organisms. Predators need not consume entire prey; some cannot digest certain body parts, while others may partially consume an organism, consistently causing its death.",
        "In 680, Ibn al-Zubayr escaped to Mecca. The people of Kufa invited Husayn to lead them and sent messages of support. Husayn dispatched his cousin Muslim bin Agail to assess their commitment. Yazid I learned of this and sent Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad from Basrah to disrupt Husayn's potential uprising. Ubayd-Allah successfully scattered Muslim bin Agail's supporters and captured him. Muslim bin Agail attempted to send a warning to Husayn about the lack of genuine support, but his request was rejected, and Ubayd-Allah subsequently executed him. While Ibn al-Zubayr remained in Mecca until his death, Husayn proceeded to Kufa with his family, unaware of the treacherous situation. Yazid I's forces, commanded by Amru bin Saad, Shamar bin Thi Al-Joshan, and Hussain bin Tamim, intercepted and battled Husayn and his male relatives, ultimately killing them. The caravan of 200 people, predominantly women including Husayn's sisters, wives, daughters, and children, was captured and transported to Damascus to be presented to Yazid I. Public sentiment eventually shifted, leading to their release and return to Medina. Ali ibn Husayn, who was too ill with fever to fight, emerged as the sole adult male survivor from the group.",
        "The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, finalized on February 2, 1848, by American diplomat Nicholas Trist and Mexican representatives Luis G. Cuevas, Bernardo Couto, and Miguel Atristain, concluded the conflict, secured U.S. control of Texas, and defined the Rio Grande as the border. As peace negotiations became known, tensions began to rise among local populations. When Mexican officials in Chihuahua learned that General Price was returning to Mexico with a substantial military force from Santa Fe on February 8, 1848, including infantry, cavalry, and artillery units, \u00c1ngel Tr\u00edas dispatched a message to Sacramento Pass requesting area succession, believing the war had ended. Misinterpreting this communication as a potential deception, General Price continued advancing toward the state capital. On March 16, 1848, Price initiated negotiations with \u00c1ngel Tr\u00edas, who responded with a decisive ultimatum. Subsequently, American and Mexican forces clashed near Santa Cruz de los Rosales on the same date, marking the war's final battle, which occurred after the peace treaty's signing. American forces maintained control of the state capital for three months following the treaty's confirmation, effectively preventing the potential state succession discussed in late 1847 and keeping the region under U.S. occupation until May 22, 1848.",

He announced on Twitter in January 2016 that SWISH would be released on February 11, following the release of \"Real Friends\" and a snippet of \"No More Parties in L.A.\" featuring Kendrick Lamar. This also revived the GOOD Fridays initiative of releasing new singles every Friday. On January 26, 2016, West revealed he had renamed the album from SWISH to Waves and announced the premiere of his Yeezy Season 3 clothing line at Madison Square Garden. Early 2016 saw West involved in a brief social media dispute with Wiz Khalifa on Twitter, which eventually included their mutual ex-partner Amber Rose, who objected to West's references to her and Khalifa's child. The feud involved Rose's allegations about her sexual history with West and garnered significant media attention. By February 2, 2016, West and Khalifa had resolved their conflict. Days before the album's release, West again changed the title to The Life of Pablo. On February 11, he premiered the album at Madison Square Garden during his Yeezy Season 3 clothing line presentation. Following the preview, West announced further track list modifications and delayed the release to finalize the recording of \"Waves\" at Chance the Rapper's suggestion. He ultimately released the album exclusively on Tidal on February 14, 2016, after a performance on SNL.",
        "In contrast, the ineffective royal justice system in the Kingdom triggered the social uprising known as the Guerras Irmandi\u00f1as ('Wars of the brotherhoods'), where coalitions of peasants and urban dwellers, backed by some knights and noblemen and operating under the distant king's legal protection, dismantled numerous castles and temporarily forced noblemen into exile in Portugal and Castile. Subsequently, during the late 15th-century dynastic conflict between Isabella I of Castile and Joanna La Beltraneja, a segment of the Galician aristocracy supported Joanna. Following Isabella's triumph, she implemented administrative and political reforms that chronicler Jeronimo Zurita described as \"doma del Reino de Galicia\": 'It was then when the taming of Galicia began, because not just the local lords and knights, but all the people of that nation were the ones against the others very bold and warlike'. These reforms established a local government and tribunal (the Real Audiencia del Reino de Galicia), subjugated the nobility, and simultaneously brought most Galician monasteries and institutions under Castilian control, a process criticized as centralization. Concurrently, the monarchs began convening the Xunta or Cortes of the Kingdom of Galicia, an assembly of city representatives, to request monetary and military support. This assembly rapidly evolved into the Kingdom's authoritative voice, legal representative, and repository of its collective will and legislation.",
        "In his work on affirmative action, Terry Eastland argues that most justifications for such policies center on addressing historical discrimination and fostering diversity. He contends that the program's originators did not foresee how its benefits would primarily accrue to middle-class minorities who were already relatively advantaged. Eastland further suggests that affirmative action imposes a psychological burden, potentially generating feelings of self-doubt and unwarranted entitlement among minority groups. He views the policy as a risky intervention with inconsistent outcomes that potentially hinders genuine meritocratic competition. Supporting this perspective, economist Thomas Sowell provides empirical critique of affirmative action, highlighting several problematic consequences. These include the tendency of non-preferred groups to strategically identify as preferred groups to access benefits, the disproportionate advantage given to more privileged members of preferred groups, the reduction of performance incentives for both preferred and non-preferred groups, and the generation of inter-group resentment and social tension.",
        "The Royal Assent ceremony occurs in the Senate, as the monarch is traditionally prohibited from entering the House of Commons. On the designated day, the Senate Speaker reads a notification from the governor general's secretary regarding the viceroy's arrival. The Senate cannot adjourn until after the ceremony concludes. The speaker sits beside the throne, with the Mace Bearer standing nearby, and the governor general enters to occupy the speaker's chair. The speaker commands the Usher of the Black Rod to summon Members of Parliament, who follow Black Rod back to the Senate, accompanied by the Sergeant-at-Arms carrying the House of Commons mace. In the Senate, Commons members stand behind the bar while Black Rod stands next to the governor general, who nods to signify Royal Assent to the presented bills (excluding appropriation bills). After completing the bill list, the Senate Clerk declares: \"in Her Majesty's name, His [or Her] Excellency the Governor General [or the deputy] doth assent to these bills.\" For appropriation bills, the House of Commons Speaker reads their titles, and the Senate clerk repeats them to the governor general, who nods to grant Royal Assent. Upon completion, the Senate Clerk recites: \"in Her Majesty's name, His [or Her] Excellency the Governor General [or the deputy] thanks her loyal subjects, accepts their benevolence and assents to these bills.\" The governor general or deputy then departs parliament.",
        "During the early to mid-1980s, Libya experienced significant economic challenges, with annual oil revenues plummeting from $21 billion to $5.4 billion between 1982 and 1986. The country initiated the ambitious Great Man-Made River irrigation project in 1983, which remained unfinished well into the 21st century despite original completion plans. Military expenditures increased while other administrative budgets were reduced. Libya continued its involvement in Chad's civil war, supporting FROLINAT and re-invading in December 1980 at GUNT's request, with Gaddafi even suggesting a political merger in January 1981. The Organisation of African Unity rejected this proposal and demanded Libya's withdrawal, which occurred in November 1981. Subsequently, Libya re-engaged militarily, confronting French-backed southern Chadian forces. By 1980, nine African states had severed diplomatic ties with Libya, and the OAU cancelled its Tripoli conference to prevent Gaddafi's potential leadership. In August 1984, Gaddafi and Moroccan King Hassan II signed the Oujda Treaty, forming the Arab-African Union, a surprising development given their historical differences. The union dissolved in August 1986 due to ongoing tensions, particularly Morocco's relations with the U.S. and Israel. Domestically, Gaddafi faced continued opposition, including a failed militia attack on his Bab al-Azizia residence in May 1984, resulting in the arrest of 5000 dissidents.",

        "From his spacetime particle interaction diagrams, Feynman developed a comprehensive physics model based on particle spins and fundamental force coupling. He proposed the parton model to explain strong interactions in nucleon scattering, which emerged as a complementary approach to the quark model developed by his Caltech colleague Murray Gell-Mann. The relationship between these models remained ambiguous, with Gell-Mann dismissively referring to Feynman's partons as \"put-ons\". During the mid-1960s, physicists considered quarks merely a mathematical symmetry tool rather than actual particles, given the seemingly impossible statistical implications of the Omega-minus particle if interpreted as three identical strange quarks. The Stanford linear accelerator's deep inelastic scattering experiments in the late 1960s, reminiscent of Rutherford's alpha particle scattering, revealed point-like particles within nucleons that scattered electrons. While these particles naturally aligned with quarks, Feynman's parton model sought to interpret experimental data without introducing additional hypotheses. The data indicated that approximately 45% of energy momentum was carried by electrically-neutral particles, now understood as gluons that mediate quark interactions and carry the three-valued color quantum number resolving the Omega-minus problem. Feynman did not challenge the quark model, and when the fifth quark was discovered in 1977, he promptly predicted the existence of a sixth quark, which was indeed found in the subsequent decade.",
        "In late 1203, John attempted to relieve Ch\u00e2teau Gaillard, which was guarding Normandy's eastern flank while under siege by Philip. His strategy involved a synchronized land and water operation, which historians consider innovative but too complex for the military capabilities of that time. Philip's forces blocked John's relief attempt, prompting John to retreat to Brittany to divert Philip from eastern Normandy. Although John successfully ravaged much of Brittany, he failed to divert Philip's primary offensive into eastern Normandy. Historians' assessments of John's military prowess vary, with recent scholars viewing his performance as marginally competent but not exceptional. John's situation quickly deteriorated as Philip and his predecessors had systematically undermined the eastern border region of Normandy over several years. Richard's previous relinquishment of key castles in the south and John's reliance on routier mercenaries in central regions further eroded his support, setting the stage for a sudden collapse of Angevin power. John retreated across the Channel in December, establishing a new defensive line west of Ch\u00e2teau Gaillard. In March 1204, Gaillard fell, and John's mother Eleanor died the following month, a personal loss that threatened to dismantle Angevin alliances in southern France. Philip circumvented the new defensive line, advancing into the Duchy with minimal resistance. By August, he had conquered Normandy and occupied Anjou and Poitou, leaving John with only the Duchy of Aquitaine.",
        "In 2013, a comprehensive study of Ashkenazi mitochondrial DNA by Martin B. Richards and his team at the University of Huddersfield challenged previous assumptions. By analyzing the full 16,600 DNA units for all subjects, compared to the 1,000 units in the 2006 Behar study, they discovered that the four primary female Ashkenazi founders had lineages established in Europe 10,000 to 20,000 years ago. Most minor founders also demonstrated deep European ancestry. The research concluded that the majority of Ashkenazi maternal lineages were not from the Near East or Caucasus, but were instead assimilated within Europe, predominantly of Italian and Old French origins. Richards emphatically rejected the Khazar hypothesis, stating that no genetic evidence supported the claim of Ashkenazi Jews originating from the Khazar Kingdom. The study estimated that approximately 80 percent of Ashkenazi maternal ancestry derives from indigenous European women, with only 8 percent from the Near East and the remaining origin undetermined. These findings suggest a significant role of female conversion in the formation of Ashkenazi communities.",
        "At the 1912 Salon d'Automne, an architectural installation known as Maison Cubiste (Cubist House) was presented, created by Raymond Duchamp-Villon, Andr\u00e9 Mare, and their collaborators. Metzinger and Gleizes, in their work Du \"Cubisme\", emphasized the autonomous nature of art, arguing that decorative considerations should not dictate artistic expression. They viewed decorative work as the \"antithesis of the picture\" and believed that a true artwork possesses an inherent purpose, capable of existing independently in various settings. According to them, a painting should gradually guide the viewer's mind towards deeper, imaginative realms. Christopher Green notes that Mare's designs served as frames for Cubist works, allowing paintings and sculptures to maintain their independence while creating intriguing contrasts. The collaboration involved artists like Gleizes, Metzinger, Marie Laurencin, the Duchamp brothers, L\u00e9ger, and Roger La Fresnaye. La Maison Cubiste was a fully furnished house featuring a staircase, wrought iron banisters, a living room (Salon Bourgeois) displaying works by Marcel Duchamp, Metzinger, Gleizes, Laurencin, and L\u00e9ger, and a bedroom. It exemplified L'art d\u00e9coratif, showcasing Cubist art within a modern, bourgeois living environment. Visitors to the Salon d'Automne walked through a full-scale 10-by-3-meter plaster model of the ground floor facade, designed by Duchamp-Villon. This architectural installation was subsequently exhibited at the 1913 Armory Show in New York, Chicago, and Boston, listed in the New York catalogue as Raymond Duchamp-Villon's number 609, \"Facade architectural, plaster\" (Fa\u00e7ade architecturale).",
        "Contemporary rock musicians increasingly incorporate mandolins, often opting for single-stringed electric versions over traditional double-stringed acoustic models. Tim Brennan of Dropkick Murphys exemplifies this trend, with the band integrating Celtic instruments like mandolin, tin whistle, and bagpipes alongside standard rock instrumentation to enhance their signature growling sound. R.E.M.'s 1991 hit \"Losing My Religion\" showcased Peter Buck's mandolin skills, reaching No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 and topping rock and alternative charts. Other notable artists embracing the mandolin include Luther Dickinson from North Mississippi Allstars and The Black Crowes, System of A Down on their Mezmerize/Hypnotize album, and Green Day on Warning. Boyd Tinsley of Dave Matthews Band has used an electric mandolin since 2005, while The Decemberists' Colin Meloy and Chris Funk regularly feature the instrument. Heart's Nancy Wilson employed mandolin in songs like \"Dream of the Archer\" and their cover of \"The Battle of Evermore,\" and Maria McKee's \"Show Me Heaven\" prominently showcased the instrument in the Days of Thunder soundtrack.",
        "In 1951, President Truman again urged Eisenhower to run for president as a Democrat, reflecting widespread support for his candidacy. However, Eisenhower expressed disagreement with the Democratic Party and declared himself and his family Republicans. A \"Draft Eisenhower\" movement within the Republican Party motivated him to enter the 1952 presidential race, primarily to challenge the non-interventionist Senator Robert A. Taft. The path to his candidacy was challenging, as Eisenhower needed convincing that political circumstances demanded his leadership and that the public genuinely wanted him as President. With Henry Cabot Lodge as his campaign manager, he was ultimately persuaded and resigned from his NATO command in June 1952 to campaign full-time. Eisenhower secured the nomination by defeating Taft, winning crucial delegate votes from Texas. His campaign resonated with the memorable slogan, \"I Like Ike\". To succeed, he strategically criticized Roosevelt's Yalta policies and Truman's approaches in Korea and China, distancing himself from his previous involvement. To placate the Republican Party's conservative wing, he selected Richard M. Nixon as his running mate, who also brought a strong anti-communist stance and youthful energy to balance Eisenhower's age.",
        "In 2006, Morgan Stanley acquired 20 acres adjacent to the Showboat Atlantic City Hotel and Casino, intending to develop a new $2 billion casino resort. Revel Entertainment Group was selected as the project's developer. The venture faced significant challenges, with a critical setback occurring in April 2010 when Morgan Stanley, holding 90% ownership of Revel Entertainment Group, halted funding and attempted to sell its stake. Despite the New Jersey state legislature passing a bill offering tax incentives to attract investors, a Fairleigh Dickinson University poll revealed that 60% of voters opposed the legislation, with many strongly against it. Governor Chris Christie ultimately provided Revel with $261 million in state tax credits to support the casino's launch. By March 2011, exterior construction was complete, and interior work continued after securing necessary funding. The casino had a soft opening in April 2012 and fully opened by May 2012. However, ten months later, in February 2013, after substantial financial losses and a dramatic value reduction from $2.4 billion to $450 million, Revel filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Despite restructuring efforts, the resort re-entered bankruptcy in June 2014 and was ultimately put up for sale. With no suitable buyers emerging, Revel closed its doors on September 2, 2014.",
        "The concluding crucial element of identity development is self-esteem, which encompasses an individual's perceptions and emotions about their personal identity. Across all demographics, there exists a universal drive to maintain and elevate one's self-worth. Contrary to common assumptions, adolescent self-esteem does not significantly decline, with baseline self-esteem remaining remarkably consistent despite rapid fluctuations. While global self-esteem measurement scales have been challenged, more nuanced assessments might provide deeper insights into adolescent experiences. For girls, self-esteem is predominantly linked to supportive friendships and social connections, with emotional and moral support being paramount. When girls struggle to establish meaningful relationships or share common interests, their self-esteem can substantially diminish. Boys, conversely, prioritize independence and authority dynamics, deriving self-worth from their ability to influence peers. Romantic competence plays a critical role in their self-perception, with romantic failures potentially triggering significant self-esteem challenges. The termination of romantic relationships universally impacts self-esteem, potentially triggering psychological consequences like depression and hopelessness. Research suggests women are twice as likely to experience depression, while men are three to four times more prone to suicidal tendencies following such emotional setbacks.",
        "The Nintendo Entertainment System was launched in North America through several distinctive bundles over the years. The Deluxe Set, priced at US$199.99, featured R.O.B., an NES Zapper light gun, two controllers, and Game Paks for Gyromite and Duck Hunt. The Basic Set initially sold for US$89.99 without a game, or US$99.99 with \"Super Mario Bros.\" The 1988 Action Set, retailing at US$149.99, included the Control Deck, two controllers, an NES Zapper, and a dual Game Pak with Super Mario Bros. and Duck Hunt. In 1989, the Power Set comprised the console, two controllers, a Zapper, a Power Pad, and a triple Game Pak featuring Super Mario Bros, Duck Hunt, and World Class Track Meet. The 1990 Sports Set bundle contained the console, an NES Satellite wireless multitap adapter, four controllers, and a dual Game Pak with Super Spike V'Ball and Nintendo World Cup. Additional bundles followed, including the 1992 Challenge Set with the console, two controllers, and Super Mario Bros. 3, priced at US$89.99. The repackaged Basic Set, introduced in 1987, now included only the console, two controllers, and the Official Nintendo Player's Guide, which provided comprehensive information about all existing NES games.",
        "The Liberal Party experienced internal strife with former Treasurer John Howard and former Foreign Minister Andrew Peacock vying for leadership. During this period, Australia faced a severe economic downturn, with unemployment peaking at 11.4% in 1992. Dr. John Hewson introduced the comprehensive 650-page Fightback! policy document in November 1991, proposing radical economic reforms including a Goods and Services Tax (GST), significant changes to Medicare, unemployment benefits, industrial relations, and substantial tax cuts. The document represented a dramatic shift from previous economic approaches, emphasizing economic liberalism over traditional conservative practices. The 15 percent GST was the policy's centerpiece, drawing intense scrutiny. Prime Minister Paul Keating launched a vigorous campaign against the proposal, arguing that the GST would disproportionately burden working-class citizens by shifting taxation from direct to indirect means. Public and pressure group opposition forced Hewson to exempt food from the GST, creating complexity around defining taxable food items. Hewson's struggle to explain these nuances was epitomized by the notorious \"birthday cake interview,\" widely considered a pivotal moment in the election campaign. Ultimately, Keating secured a record fifth consecutive Labor term in 1993. While many Fightback! proposals were initially rejected, subsequent governments gradually implemented various elements, most notably the GST under the Howard Liberal government.",
        "Constantius ordered Liberius into exile in 356, giving him three days to comply. He was banished to Beroea in Thrace. Constantius sent expensive presents, hoping Liberius would accept the Arian position, but he refused. He offered five hundred pieces of gold \"to bear his charges,\" which Liberius rejected, telling the messenger to give them to his flatterers. He similarly returned a gift from the empress, urging the messenger to believe in Christ and not persecute the Church of God. When attempts were made to leave the presents in the Church, Liberius threw them out. Constantius then summoned him under strict guard to Milan, where, in a conference recorded by Theodoret, Liberius boldly declared that Athanasius had been acquitted at Sardica, his enemies proven to be calumniators and impostors, and that it was unjust to condemn someone not legally convicted of any crime. The emperor was silenced but, growing impatient, ordered Liberius into exile. Two years later, Constantius visited Rome to celebrate the twentieth year of his reign. The ladies petitioned for Liberius's restoration, which the emperor granted on the condition that he comply with the court bishops. Liberius subscribed to the condemnation of Athanasius and the Arian creed from Sirmium. No sooner had he recovered his see than he declared himself for the Creed of Nicaea, as Theodoret testifies. The Emperor knew what narrative he wanted to promote, as did the bishops at his court. Athanasius remained steadfast to the orthodox creed. Constantius, an avowed Arian, became sole ruler in 350 upon his brother Constans's death.",
        "The Montana Territory was established on April 26, 1864, through the U.S. Organic Act. Educational institutions began emerging in the region even before its territorial status, as settlers arrived. Initial schools were subscription-based and typically conducted in teachers' homes. Fort Owen in Bitterroot Valley hosted the first documented formal school in 1862, serving Indian children and children of fort employees. The inaugural school term commenced in early winter and concluded on February 28, with Mr. Robinson as the instructor. Another early subscription school was established by Thomas Dimsdale in Virginia City in 1863, charging students $1.75 weekly. The Montana Territorial Legislative Assembly convened its first meeting in 1864, authorizing counties to impose school taxes, thereby laying groundwork for public education. Madison County became the first to utilize these new tax provisions, creating the initial public school in Virginia City in 1886. Though originally scheduled to begin in January 1866, severe weather delayed the opening until March. The school year extended through summer, ending on August 17. Sarah Raymond, a 25-year-old wagon train traveler from 1865, was among the first teachers. She obtained her teaching certificate by taking a home-based exam and paying a $6 gold dust fee. Alongside her assistant Mrs. Farley, Raymond taught 50-60 students from the school's total enrollment of 81. Her monthly salary was $125, while Mrs. Farley earned $75. Instead of standard textbooks, the school utilized books brought by various emigrants. Raymond left teaching the following year but later became Madison County's school superintendent.",
        "On 20 June 1794, Burke received a vote of thanks from the Commons for his services in the Hastings Trial and promptly resigned his seat, with his son Richard taking his place. A devastating personal tragedy struck when Richard died in August 1794, a loss that deeply affected Burke, who had perceived exceptional potential in his son that may have been more a reflection of his own hopes than reality, though Richard had indeed made meaningful contributions to the early Catholic emancipation efforts. King George III, who had developed a favorable view of Burke due to his stance on the French Revolution, intended to elevate him to the Earl of Beaconsfield, but his son's death eliminated this opportunity. Burke ultimately accepted only a pension of \u00a32,500. This modest reward was challenged by the Duke of Bedford and the Earl of Lauderdale, prompting Burke's passionate response in his Letter to a Noble Lord (1796), where he famously declared: \"It cannot at this time be too often repeated; line upon line; precept upon precept; until it comes into the currency of a proverb, To innovate is not to reform\". He argued that his reward was earned through merit, in contrast to the Duke of Bedford's inherited privileges, and subtly warned about the potential consequences of revolutionary ideas while offering a defense of the British constitutional system.",
        "The country quickly descended into a civil war characterized by conflicts between various clan-affiliated factions. Over 500,000 residents departed due to persecution, economic hardship, and opportunities in the West or other former Soviet republics. In 1992, Emomali Rahmon secured the presidency by defeating Abdumalik Abdullajanov with 58% of the vote in an election held shortly after the war's conclusion. The nation was left in total ruin, with over 100,000 estimated deaths and approximately 1.2 million people displaced internally and externally. A ceasefire was negotiated in 1997 between Rahmon and opposition groups, mediated by UN Special Representative Gerd D. Merrem, which was widely celebrated as a successful peacekeeping effort and guaranteed the opposition 30% of ministerial positions. Subsequent elections in 1999 saw Rahmon re-elected with 98% of the vote, despite criticism from opposition parties and international observers. The 2006 election, which Rahmon won with 79% of the vote, was boycotted by several opposition parties and criticized by the OSCE, though Commonwealth of Independent States observers deemed it legitimate. Rahmon's administration faced further criticism in 2010 for media censorship, with the OSCE alleging government interference through website censorship and tax inspections that effectively silenced independent newspapers.",
        "Yale's prominence in national elections since the Vietnam War has been attributed to multiple factors. Campus activism from the 1960s and Reverend William Sloane Coffin's intellectual influence are frequently cited as foundational elements. Yale's leadership, including President Richard Levin, emphasizes the institution's commitment to cultivating future leaders, a strategy initiated by previous presidents Alfred Whitney Griswold and Kingman Brewster. Former Yale College dean Richard H. Brodhead highlights the university's strong emphasis on community engagement and volunteerism. Historian Gaddis Smith points to Yale's tradition of organized activity, exemplified by students like John Kerry, George Pataki, and Joseph Lieberman taking leadership roles in campus organizations. Camille Paglia suggests the university's networking culture and inherent elitism contribute to its political success. Some observers, like CNN, note potential advantages for politically connected students, while New York Times and Atlantic Monthly correspondents credit Yale's collaborative environment that promotes collective commitment over individual ambition.",
        "During King George V's reign, the most significant architectural renovation occurred in 1913 when Sir Aston Webb redesigned Blore's 1850 East Front, partially inspired by Giacomo Leoni's Lyme Park in Cheshire. The new principal fa\u00e7ade, constructed from Portland stone, was intended to serve as a backdrop for the Victoria Memorial statue positioned outside the main gates. Succeeding Edward VII in 1910, George V adopted a more serious approach to royal responsibilities, prioritizing official entertaining over extravagant social events. He pioneered royal jazz performances, hosting groundbreaking concerts featuring the Original Dixieland Jazz Band in 1919 and later performances by Sidney Bechet and Louis Armstrong in 1932, which ultimately earned the palace a nomination for a (Kind of) Blue Plaque by the Brecon Jazz Festival for its significant contribution to UK jazz music. His wife, Queen Mary, was a passionate art enthusiast who meticulously curated and expanded the Royal Collection. She personally oversaw numerous interior improvements, including installing a pair of marble Empire-style chimneypieces by Benjamin Vulliamy in the ground floor Bow Room and decorating the Blue Drawing Room, a 69-foot-long space with a distinctive Nash-designed coffered ceiling adorned with elaborate gilt console brackets.",
        "The departures of N\u00fa\u00f1ez and van Gaal barely registered with supporters compared to Lu\u00eds Figo's exit, who was then the club vice-captain. Figo had achieved near-legendary status and was considered almost a local by Catalans. However, his decision to join bitter rivals Real Madrid devastated Barcelona fans, who responded with extreme animosity during his subsequent visits to Camp Nou. During his first return match, fans hurled a piglet's head and a whiskey bottle at him. The following three years saw the club's steady deterioration, with managers rapidly changing positions. Serra Ferrer replaced van Gaal and, despite significant player investments in summer 2000, oversaw a mediocre league performance and an embarrassing early Champions League elimination before being dismissed mid-season. Carles Rexach, a long-time coach, was appointed temporarily and managed to secure the final Champions League qualification spot on the season's last day. Although the team showed improved form in La Liga and reached the Champions League semi-finals, Rexach was never considered a permanent solution. Louis van Gaal returned for a second managerial stint, which, despite another respectable Champions League showing, produced one of the club's worst La Liga campaigns, with the team plummeting to 15th place in February 2003. This led to van Gaal's resignation and replacement by Radomir Anti\u0107, who could only secure a sixth-place finish. Ultimately, Anti\u0107's contract was not renewed, and club president Joan Gaspart resigned after a disastrous three-year tenure marked by continuous decline."
