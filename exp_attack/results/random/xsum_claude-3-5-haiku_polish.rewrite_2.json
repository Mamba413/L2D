      "Major Richard Scott, aged 40, faces a charge of causing death by careless driving following a collision on a Wiltshire B-road. The incident occurred in bad weather, with strong wind and rain, and involved Scott's Audi A6 allegedly travelling at speeds up to 95mph (153km/h). Gareth Hicks, 24, died when the van he was asleep in was struck by Scott's vehicle. Scott, from Green Lane in Shepperton, Surrey, denies the charge. Prosecutor Charles Gabb stated that Scott crossed the carriageway of the 60mph-limit B390 in Shrewton near Amesbury. Gabb described the weather as \"awful\" and alleged that Scott's car was \"twitching\" and potentially aquaplaning before hitting a BMW driven by Craig Reed. While the Audi returned to its lane, it crossed the carriageway again, colliding head-on with a Ford Transit van where Hicks was a passenger. Gabb emphasized that there was no doubt Scott's Audi was on the wrong side of the road when it struck the van. \n\n\n",

During the incident, Gareth Hicks, 24, tragically died when the van he was sleeping in was struck by Major Scott's vehicle. Prosecutor Charles Gabb stated that Major Scott dangerously exceeded the 60 mph speed limit on the B390 near Shrewton during heavy rainfall and strong winds. Witnesses described Scott's car as \"twitching\" and possibly aquaplaning before initially colliding with a BMW driven by Craig Reed. The Audi then reportedly returned to its lane before veering across the road again and colliding head-on with a Ford Transit van carrying Mr. Hicks and his colleague Patrick Gilleece, who were traveling to a construction site in Salisbury.  Major Scott, who sustained significant injuries and claims to have no memory of the crash, denies the charge of causing death by careless driving. He suggests that Mr. Reed was responsible for initiating the collision. The trial is currently in progress. \n",

Only 47% of children from the poorest families in northern England reached a good level of early years development, compared to 59% in London.\n\nThe IPPR also highlights a noteworthy statistic: five northern city-regions collectively possess nearly as many highly qualified individuals (3.6 million) as London (3.7 million).

To address this, the think tank has proposed 11 benchmarks for Chancellor George Osborne's northern powerhouse scheme, emphasizing the urgent need to close the attainment gap in early childhood development. \n\nIPPR director Ed Cox stresses the importance of investing in children's early development, stating: \"We will never become a powerhouse economy when our children and young people have such a poor start in life. It will take a generation of investment.\"  The government maintains that additional funds are being allocated to early years providers to support children from disadvantaged backgrounds and bridge the attainment gap. \n\n\n"

Mallinder stated that North desires to return to play and doesn't want to be treated as if his career is finished. This incident marks North's second significant head injury.

The London Fire Brigade (LFB) intends to allocate the resulting savings towards increasing staffing levels for Fire Rescue Units. However, the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) criticizes the plan, calling it \"dangerous and reckless\" and opposing the permanent removal of engines. While the LFB has presented three savings plans, assuring that no fire stations will close and no firefighters will be laid off, the FBU remains concerned. The LFB asserts that it has consistently met London-wide response time targets during the engines' inactivity and claims reintroducing them would decrease response times by approximately four seconds for the first arriving engine at an emergency. London Assembly Member Andrew Dismore suggests an alternative approach: restoring the 13 fire engines to service while achieving savings through alternative crewing arrangements at stations equipped with specialized equipment. These proposals will be discussed on December 2nd, with a comprehensive public consultation planned to explore potential savings. The FBU maintains its opposition, particularly in light of recent terrorist attacks, warning that further engine reductions could jeopardize emergency response capabilities and potentially lengthen response times, citing the impact of last year's station closures.   \n"

The 46-year-old resident of Kilmarnock pleaded guilty to charges of dangerous driving, failing to stop after an accident, and operating an unsafe vehicle.

However, economists offered a more cautious view, pointing to potential signs of economic slowdown and suggesting the jobs recovery might be losing momentum.

The opposition Democrat Party, which boycotted the vote, has warned of widespread street demonstrations if the bill progresses to the Senate. \n\nJonathan Head, BBC South East Asia correspondent, reports that the bill's passage through the Senate is uncertain due to the appointment system used for half of its members. However, a vote could occur as early as next week, potentially igniting further protests. \n\nSupporters of the amnesty argue it will provide closure to the deep political divisions that have plagued Thailand since the 2006 coup, including the 2008 airport occupation and the deadly 2010 Bangkok protests.

This floor, according to the manifesto, will be introduced after a referendum on Income Tax powers is held in the next Parliament.

Frances O'Grady from the TUC corroborated this, stating that many fathers are financially unable to take time off.\n\nCurrently, fathers are entitled to one or two weeks of paid leave, with a possibility of additional time if the mother resumes work. The government's forthcoming changes aim to foster flexibility, aspiring to cultivate a cultural shift that empowers working fathers to be more actively involved in their children's early months and assists in retaining skilled women in the workforce. \n\n\n"

      "Julia Knight, 56, has pleaded not guilty to charges of attempted murder and grievous bodily harm with intent against her mother, 81-year-old Irene Robson, at Horton Hospital in Banbury in October 2014.  Knight admitted to administering insulin to her mother but insists her actions were driven by a desire to prevent her discharge from the hospital. She denies intending to cause her mother serious harm and expressed remorse for her actions, stating she felt terrible knowing she would make her mother unwell and that it was a profoundly misguided action she would take back if possible. Knight admitted to initially providing false statements to police in January. Evidence presented at Oxford Crown Court revealed that Knight obtained a forged insulin prescription from a Sainsbury's store in Banbury. When questioned by her defense counsel, Simon Mayo QC, about her initial denial of injecting her mother, Knight said she recognized the severity of her actions and felt ashamed. Prosecutor John Price QC suggested that Knight intended to give a potentially lethal dose of insulin, but Knight maintained that she never intended to kill her mother. The court was informed of a previous suicide attempt by insulin injection in 2006.  While Ms Robson passed away in September, the jury was instructed that this fact was not relevant to the current case. The trial is ongoing. \n\n\n",

      "South Korea's Korea Space Launch Vehicle-1 (KSLV-1), also known as Naro, successfully launched a climate-data collecting satellite into orbit from the Naro Space Center at 16:00 (07:00 GMT).  Science Minister Lee Ju-ho confirmed the satellite was in its designated orbit.  This launch follows North Korea's recent successful launch of a satellite using a three-stage rocket, which drew international condemnation.  The 140-tonne Naro rocket, a joint project between South Korea and Russia, had been previously launched in 2009 and 2010, but both attempts were unsuccessful.  This launch, delayed twice for technical reasons, proceeded as planned, reaching its target altitude and deploying the satellite.  \"After analyzing various data, the Naro rocket successfully put the science satellite into designated orbit,\" Mr. Lee told reporters, adding that the satellite detached 540 seconds after launch.  He declared that South Korea had taken \"a step to become a space-power nation\" and would utilize this \"overwhelming\" capability.  \n",

According to Science Minister Lee Ju-ho, the climate data-collecting satellite successfully entered its designated orbit. This launch follows weeks after North Korea placed a satellite into orbit using its own three-stage rocket, drawing international condemnation. South Korea's 140-tonne rocket, Naro, was a collaborative project with Russia, which had agreed to support Seoul for three launch attempts. Two previous launches in 2009 and 2010 were unsuccessful, and this attempt faced two postponements due to technical issues. However, officials confirmed that Wednesday's launch, from the site 480km (298 miles) south of Seoul, proceeded successfully. The rocket achieved its target altitude and deployed the satellite as planned. Lee informed reporters, \"After analyzing various data, the Naro rocket successfully put the science satellite into the designated orbit.\" He stated that the satellite separated 540 seconds after liftoff.

Exports declined slightly by 0.7% to \u00a3882 million, but the pound's devaluation after the Brexit referendum boosted overseas purchasing power. \nHoward Pridding, British Marine's CEO, emphasized the industry's strength, pointing to ongoing revenue growth and job creation. Despite economic instability, the sector remained resilient, ranking as the fourth-largest marine industry globally by turnover. Sunseeker and Princess stood out as the UK's leading superyacht manufacturers, representing British maritime innovation and entrepreneurial spirit. \n\n"

Stuart Mitchell came in second with the joke: \"Why is it old people say 'there's no place like home', yet when you put them in one...\" Judges reviewed an average of 60 comedy performances and evaluated over 3,600 minutes of material before selecting their preferred jokes. To ensure an unbiased selection, the comic's name and show were not revealed during voting. Steve North, general manager of Dave, stated that the Fringe is known for discovering new comedy talent, with this year's top 10 featuring both returning and emerging performers. Voters also selected the most \"groan-worthy\" jokes, including Adam Hess' line: \"In France, J-Lo is called 'I have and water'\", and Darren Walsh's gag: \"What do you call three members of Abba in a French slaughterhouse? Abba trois.\"\n"

He admitted having no specific reason to remember the encounter until he was interviewed by a reporter in June. Stewart faces charges of drugging and suffocating Bailey, disposing of her body in the cess pit, and three counts of perverting the course of justice. The trial is ongoing. \n\n\n"

Warnock acknowledged having some interest in the player previously but stated there were no current plans to pursue a deal.  \n\nNetherlands Under-21 international Weghorst started his career with FC Emmen before joining Heracles in 2014. While Heracles chairman Jam Smit believed a fee had been agreed with Cardiff for Weghorst, who has also been linked with Celtic, Warnock maintained only an initial inquiry had been made some time ago.  \n\nWarnock aims to make up to three signings during the transfer window to bolster Cardiff's Championship play-off aspirations. The current gap between Cardiff and the top six stands at four points. A striker is a priority signing following the departure of Kenwyne Jones, last season's top scorer, to Al Jazira in the United Arab Emirates. Jones, a Trinidad and Tobago international, stated on social media that Cardiff had not offered him a new contract, but Warnock contested this claim.  \n\nWarnock expressed confidence that discussions had taken place between Jones, his representatives, chief executive Ken Choo, and the board of directors regarding a potential new deal.\n\n\n\n",

      "Researchers at the University of Bristol warn that the Sakurajima volcano, located in Japan's Kyushu island 49 kilometers from the Sendai nuclear plant and near Kagoshima, a city of 600,000 inhabitants, poses a \"growing threat\".  Sakurajima's last deadly eruption occurred in 1914, resulting in 58 fatalities. Japan, situated on the Pacific \"Ring of fire\", is home to over 100 volcanoes. Sakurajima frequently emits ash and experiences numerous small explosions annually, with the most recent eruption happening in February. Japanese authorities closely monitor the volcano, which is classified as Level 3 out of 5 on Japan's volcanic warning system, advising people to avoid approaching it. Dr. James Hickey, the study's lead author, who now works at the University of Exeter's Camborne School of Mines, stated that the 1914 eruption had a volume of approximately 1.5 cubic kilometers. Based on their data, the team estimates it would take roughly 130 years for the volcano to accumulate sufficient magma for an eruption of comparable magnitude, implying that a significant eruption could occur within the next 25 years. \n\n\n",
