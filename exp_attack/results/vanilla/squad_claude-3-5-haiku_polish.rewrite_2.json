      "In 1954, prominent Serbian and Croatian writers, linguists, and literary critics, supported by Matica srpska and Matica hrvatska, signed the Novi Sad Agreement. This agreement, in its initial conclusion, declared that Serbs, Croats, and Montenegrins shared a single language with two equally developed variants originating in Zagreb (western) and Belgrade (eastern).  \n\nThe agreement advocated for the equal standing of both Cyrillic and Latin alphabets, as well as Ekavian and Ijekavian pronunciations.  It stipulated that \"Serbo-Croatian\" should be used officially, while traditional Serbian and Croatian could be employed in informal settings. Matica hrvatska and Matica srpska were tasked with collaborating on a dictionary, and a committee comprising Serbian and Croatian linguists was appointed to develop a pravopis.\n\nDuring the 1960s, both the dictionary and pravopis were published simultaneously: the dictionary in Ijekavian Latin in Zagreb and the pravopis in Ekavian Cyrillic in Novi Sad. However, Croatian linguists contend that this was an act of unitarianism.  Their support for this claim is limited. Croatian linguist Stjepan Babi\u0107 asserted that television broadcasts from Belgrade consistently utilized the Latin alphabet, which was accurate but not indicative of unequal treatment, but rather reflected usage frequency and prestige. Babi\u0107 also criticized the Novi Sad Dictionary (1967) for presenting side-by-side words from both the Croatian and Serbian variants whenever they differed. This practice, however, can be interpreted as a demonstration of careful respect for both variants, rather than unitarism. \n\n\n",

      "The Novi Sad Agreement, signed in 1954 by Serbian and Croatian intellectuals backed by Matica srpska and Matica hrvatska, declared that Serbs, Croats, and Montenegrins shared a single language with two equal variants, one centered around Zagreb and the other around Belgrade.  The agreement advocated for equal recognition of Cyrillic and Latin scripts, as well as Ekavian and Ijekavian pronunciations. It proposed \"Serbo-Croatian\" as the official language name, while allowing for informal use of \"Serbian\" and \"Croatian.\" Matica hrvatska and Matica srpska pledged to collaborate on a dictionary, and a joint committee of Serbian and Croatian linguists worked on a pravopis.  During the 1960s, both the dictionary and the pravopis were published, the dictionary in Ijekavian Latin in Zagreb and the pravopis in Ekavian Cyrillic in Novi Sad. Despite this collaborative effort, Croatian linguists saw it as an act of unitarianism. Their arguments, however, lacked conclusive evidence: Stjepan Babi\u0107's criticism of Belgrade television's use of Latin script reflected usage patterns, not systemic inequality. His critique of the Novi Sad Dictionary's side-by-side word listings could also be interpreted as a meticulous respect for linguistic diversity. Croatian linguists even criticized sections of the dictionary written by their own countrymen and overlooked the Croatian Philological Society's contribution to the Pravopisni rje\u010dnik. These tensions led Croatian intellectuals to issue the Declaration on the Status and Name of the Croatian Literary Language in 1967, which was re-published in 2012 with critical analysis by the Croatian weekly Forum, marking its 45th anniversary. \n\n\n",

However, their relationship was more complex. Thatcher later acknowledged her personal respect for the Queen, who reciprocated by bestowing upon her prestigious honors. Former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney even characterized Elizabeth as a pivotal, albeit discreet, force in dismantling apartheid, emphasizing the Queen's understated yet substantial political influence. \n",
      "The 1980s witnessed the royal family's transformation into a media phenomenon, with newspapers publishing sensational stories that often blurred the lines between truth and fabrication. Kelvin MacKenzie, editor of The Sun, instructed his staff to prioritize royal stories for Monday's issue, disregarding concerns about accuracy. Donald Trelford of The Observer observed that the \"royal soap opera\" had reached a point where truth seemed inconsequential. Rumors circulated regarding strained relations between Queen Elizabeth II and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, with reports suggesting the monarch harbored anxieties about unemployment, social fragmentation, and Thatcher's stance on apartheid. Although royal aide Michael Shea maintained that his comments were misconstrued, speculation intensified, including a rumor that Thatcher believed the Queen would endorse her political adversaries. Notwithstanding these reported tensions, the relationship between the two women possessed a more intricate dimension. Thatcher subsequently expressed personal admiration for the Queen, who in turn bestowed upon her esteemed accolades. Former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney even asserted that Queen Elizabeth II played a pivotal behind-the-scenes role in dismantling apartheid, underscoring the Queen's understated yet substantial political influence. \n\n\n"

      "Emotions are essential to human social interactions and relationships, stemming from basic physiology and stress systems. The oxytocin-attachment system is key to bonding, and emotional temperaments influence social connectedness and survival in complex societies. These traits are common across species and taxa, arising from genetic inheritance. DNA sequences contain genetic information that determines protein structure within cells. Zygotes inherit genetic material from parental germ cells. During evolution, heritable traits that aided ancestral survival and reproduction are passed down, including potentially advantageous new traits.  \n\nIn the five million years since humans and chimpanzees diverged, only about 1.2% of their genetic material has changed, indicating that the differences between these species are encoded in this small genetic variation.  Animal behavior studies show examples of gene-dependent behavioral phenotypes. For instance, minor genetic differences in the vasopressin receptor gene of voles correspond to significant variations in social organization and mating systems. Similarly, the FOCP2 gene, involved in neural circuitry related to speech and language, differs from its chimpanzee counterpart by just a few mutations and has been present for about 200,000 years, coinciding with the emergence of modern humans.

Post-war, many Germans left Strasbourg, some facing denunciation or forced expulsion by the new French authorities. The shadow of the Saverne Affair continued to linger in the collective memory of Alsace. \n\n\n"

      "French kings attempted to increase their power during the 14th century by diminishing the territories held by the nobility.  Their efforts to seize land belonging to the English crown in southern France proved unsuccessful, sparking the Hundred Years' War (1337-1453).

      "Identity development is a crucial phase in the adolescent life cycle, typically beginning during these years. Adolescents explore various behaviors and appearances to understand themselves better. This exploration involves trying on different identities to find one that resonates. However, establishing and maintaining a strong identity during adolescence can be challenging due to influences like family, surroundings, and social standing. Research suggests that identity development is a dynamic process of change rather than a static formation, affecting both the content and structure of self-perceptions.\n\nTwo key aspects of this development are self-clarity and self-esteem. As choices made during adolescence can shape future lives, heightened self-awareness and self-control during mid-adolescence are crucial for making sound decisions as individuals transition into adulthood. \n\nResearchers utilize three primary approaches to comprehend identity development: self-concept, sense of identity, and self-esteem.

While the search for identity often begins during these years, adolescents experiment with various behaviors and appearances to explore their sense of self. This exploration involves cycling through different identities to find one that resonates. However, establishing and maintaining a stable identity during adolescence can be challenging due to influences from family, environment, and social standing. Research suggests that identity development is a dynamic process of change in self-perception and structure, rather than a singular formation.  \n\nTwo key aspects of this development are self-clarity and self-esteem. Decisions made during adolescence can shape future life paths, emphasizing the importance of self-awareness and self-control during this period to facilitate smooth transitions into adulthood.  \n\nResearchers employ three primary approaches to understand identity development: self-concept, sense of identity, and self-esteem. The adolescent years cultivate a more conscientious group of young adults, as they demonstrate heightened attention and consideration towards their surroundings and experiences. \n\n\n"

      "Adolescence is a period of significant identity development, a journey of self-discovery marked by experimentation and exploration.  Young people try on different behaviors and appearances, seeking an authentic sense of self. This process involves repeated attempts to define who they are, with influences from family, environment, and society shaping their path. Research shows that identity development is dynamic, involving changes in both how individuals see themselves and the structure of their self-perception. Self-clarity and self-esteem are crucial for navigating this complex period.

Clinicians nationwide report an increase in diagnoses of herpes and human papillomavirus (HPV), which can cause genital warts. Current estimates indicate that HPV affects 15 percent of the teen population.  Girls aged 15 to 19 exhibit higher rates of gonorrhea than any other age group. Notably, one-quarter of all new HIV cases occur among individuals under 21. \n"

      "Bermuda's population history has been complicated by ethnic blending over the last four centuries. Currently, there is little ethnic difference between Black and White Bermudians, except in recent immigrant groups. However, this was not always the case. During the 17th century's first hundred years, English Protestant whites formed the majority, alongside smaller white groups of Irish (many likely speaking Gaelic) and Scots, who were sent to Bermuda after the English invasions of their homelands following the English Civil War. Non-white populations included free Black (indentured) individuals from the West Indies, Black chattel slaves mainly captured from Spanish and Portuguese ships by Bermudian privateers, and Native Americans, primarily from Algonquian and other tribes along the Atlantic seaboard, possibly even from as far as Mexico. By the 19th century, the number of ethnically English White Bermudians had declined.  Efforts to restrict the arrival of Irish immigrants, along with repeated attempts to encourage free Black emigration and pressure on Black slave owners, all contributed to this shift. \n\n\n",

      "Bermuda's population history, dating back four centuries, has been significantly altered by ethnic blending.  Initially, English Protestants, primarily white, formed the core of the settlement, joined by smaller groups of white Irish and Scots displaced by the English Civil War.  Non-white populations included free blacks from the West Indies, enslaved Africans taken from Spanish and Portuguese vessels, and Native Americans from various Atlantic tribes and potentially Mexico.  By the 19th century, the white English majority dwindled as various minority groups coalesced into a new \"coloured\" category, encompassing anyone not of purely European descent.  Offspring of mixed parentage were classified as \"coloured,\" a term now largely replaced by \"black\" or \"of African heritage.\" This shift, though aiming for clarity, obscures the island's multifaceted racial background.  Immigration restrictions aimed at limiting demographic mixing have proven unsuccessful. Black immigration from the West Indies has outweighed white influx from Portugal, Britain, and other regions, solidifying the black majority.

Throughout the 1990s, analysts often predicted Apple's downfall, pointing to its small market share. Yet, Apple differentiated the Mac as a premium personal computer, challenging conventional definitions of success. The rapidly growing PC market masked the Mac's rising sales, creating an impression of stagnation while actual Mac usage climbed steadily. The iPhone and iPad's launch shifted Apple's financial picture, reducing Macintosh profits to 24% in 2010 from 46% in 2008. Despite these changes, Apple remained profitable after Steve Jobs' return and organizational restructuring. A 2008 report highlighted Apple's dominant 66% share of computers priced above $1,000, demonstrating its appeal to affluent customers.

      "Predators are organisms that kill and eat other living beings.  Predation is distinct from other types of harm because it involves the direct killing of prey. Predators utilize various hunting strategies, including actively chasing or ambushing their prey. Some predators, like jaguars and humans, break down large prey before consuming it, while others, such as bottlenose dolphins and snakes, swallow their prey whole. Animals like cats and dogs adjust their hunting techniques based on the size of their prey. Venom is employed by certain predators, like box jellyfish and cone shells, to paralyze or kill prey, with some venoms even beginning the digestion process.  Prey may die within the predator's digestive system in cases like baleen whales ingesting large amounts of plankton. Seed and egg predation are also considered true predation because they target potential organisms. Predators do not always consume their entire prey; some are unable to digest certain body parts, while others may partially consume an organism, ultimately leading to its death.  \n",
      "Predation is the act of one organism killing and consuming another living being.  Unlike other forms of harm, predation involves the direct killing of the prey. Predators utilize a variety of hunting strategies, including active pursuit or ambush. Some predators, like jaguars or humans, dismember large prey before eating it, while others, such as bottlenose dolphins or snakes, consume prey whole.  Domestic cats and dogs adjust their predation methods based on the size of their prey. Venom is used by certain predators, like box jellyfish and cone shells, to subdue or kill prey, with some venoms even beginning the digestion process. Prey may die within the predator's digestive system, as seen in baleen whales feeding on vast amounts of plankton. Seed and egg predation are also considered true predation because they involve potential organisms. It is not necessary for predators to consume the entire prey; some cannot digest certain parts, while others may partially consume an organism, ultimately leading to its death.  \n"

During this period, peasant and burgher leagues, backed by some knights, nobles, and operating under the protection of the distant king, seized numerous castles, temporarily forcing the nobility to flee to Portugal and Castile. This instability continued into the late 15th century with the dynastic conflict between Isabella I of Castile and Joanna La Beltraneja.  A segment of the Galician aristocracy sided with Joanna, but Isabella's victory prompted her to implement administrative and political reforms in Galicia, as described by chronicler Jeronimo Zurita as \"doma del Reino de Galicia\" - 'the taming of the Kingdom of Galicia'. Zurita attributed this characterization to the Galician people's historical boldness and warlike nature. These reforms, while establishing local governance and a tribunal (the Real Audiencia del Reino de Galicia) and bringing the nobility under control, also placed most Galician monasteries and institutions under Castilian rule, a move criticized for its centralizing tendencies.

Merrem, the United Nations' Special Representative to the Secretary General, was reached in 1997 between Rahmon and opposition parties, widely hailed as a successful peacekeeping effort. The accord stipulated that 30% of ministerial positions would be allocated to the opposition.  Elections followed in 1999, but were met with criticism from opposition groups. \n",
      "Civil war erupted almost immediately after the nation's formation, dividing it into factions primarily defined by clan allegiances. Over 500,000 residents sought refuge during this period, driven by persecution, worsening poverty, and the promise of better economic prospects in Western regions or former Soviet republics. Emomali Rahmon emerged victorious in the 1992 presidential election, defeating former prime minister Abdumalik Abdullajanov with 58% of the vote. This election, held shortly after the war's conclusion, took place in a nation ravaged by conflict. Estimates of the death toll exceeded 100,000, while 1.2 million people were internally or externally displaced.

The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe repeatedly denounced Rahmon's regime for media censorship and political repression, highlighting systematic efforts to suppress independent journalism through website blocking and targeted tax inspections that silenced critical voices. \n\n\n",

In 1913, Sir Aston Webb revamped Blore's 1850 East Front, drawing inspiration from Giacomo Leoni's Lyme Park in Cheshire.

      "The reign of King George V saw extensive architectural changes at Buckingham Palace. Sir Aston Webb's 1913 redesign of the East Front, constructed from Portland stone, provided an elegant setting for the Victoria Memorial.  The king's more formal approach to his role led to a shift in royal protocols, highlighting official duties over lavish social gatherings. King George V's patronage of modern music was progressive, featuring innovative jazz performances by notable artists like the Original Dixieland Jazz Band and Louis Armstrong. Queen Mary contributed to this cultural shift through her dedicated work in curating the Royal Collection. She meticulously restored and expanded its art holdings. Her design sensibility is evident in her choices, including the Empire-style marble chimneypieces in the Bow Room and her restoration of the Blue Drawing Room, a grand 69-foot space showcasing Nash's intricate coffered ceiling adorned with ornate gilt console brackets. Their collective efforts transformed Buckingham Palace into a symbol of early 20th-century British royal elegance. \n\n\n",

Figo, the club's vice-captain, had attained cult hero status and was viewed as one of their own by the Catalans.  Barcelona supporters were devastated by Figo's decision to join Real Madrid, their fierce rivals. During his subsequent visits to Camp Nou, Figo faced an intensely hostile reception.  Upon his first return, a pig's head and a full bottle of whiskey were hurled at him from the stands. The following three years witnessed the club's decline, with managers coming and going. After van Gaal, Lloren\u00e7 Serra Ferrer took charge. Despite a significant investment in players during the summer of 2000, Ferrer's tenure was marked by a lackluster league performance and a humiliating first-round exit in the Champions League. He was eventually dismissed late in the season. Carles Rexach, a longtime coach, was appointed as his successor, initially on a temporary basis.
