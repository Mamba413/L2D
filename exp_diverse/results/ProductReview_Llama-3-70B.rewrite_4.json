After verifying my ring size, I entrusted them with the task and eagerly anticipated its return. \n\nUpon returning later that afternoon, I discovered the ring was too small.  Embarrassingly, it was my own oversight; I should have chosen a half-size up.\n\nTo my immense relief, the Shalimar team was incredibly understanding and accommodating.  They resized the ring again, this time perfectly, and had it back to me within an hour – all without any additional charge.  \n\nTheir kindness and professionalism, especially considering my mistake, made a lasting impression. I am deeply grateful for this remarkable experience and will undoubtedly return to Shalimar for all my future jewelry needs. \n\n\n"

My daughter and I chose the customizable sushi bowls, where we selected our proteins, vegetables, rice, and toppings from a clear menu. While I appreciated the menu's organization, I found the vegetable choices somewhat limited and the rice-to-food ratio unbalanced. The sauces, however, were a standout.\n\nMy husband's order, the Maui roll - a personal favorite from the 96th Street location - fell short of expectations. While still enjoyable, it lacked the same quality and consistency.\n\n\nDespite these minor disappointments, I'd return, especially for the customizable sushi bowls.  I'd also like to address the negative reviews regarding service. Remember, this is a sushi restaurant, not a fast-food establishment, so a bit of patience is appreciated.  The wait is worth it for a healthier alternative to fast food in the area.\n\nFinally, I must recommend their bubble tea - the strawberry flavor was a delight, and I'm eager to try the vanilla chai next time.\n\n\n\n"

      "Weaver's Way holds a special place in my heart, and I strongly disagree with some of the negative reviews I've seen. While it's not designed for quick, everyday convenience shopping, I, as a single woman, find it incredibly easy to navigate, even during peak hours. In fact, I see it as a perfect fit for singles like me because it allows me to purchase smaller quantities of items, something that's often difficult in larger chain stores like Acme.\n\nBeyond the shopping experience, I appreciate the flexible work hours. I've had the opportunity to work in various departments, and currently, I'm contributing to the membership committee.  \n\nContrary to the stereotype of \"tree huggers\" and \"earth children,\" the Weaver's Way community is incredibly diverse, bringing together individuals from various backgrounds who share a common commitment to ethical and sustainable practices.\n\nWhat truly sets Weaver's Way apart is its focus on locally sourced produce, natural and wholesome foods free from preservatives, and competitive prices that are significantly lower than Whole Foods. I love interacting with fellow members and actively participating in both my local and global community.\n\nWhile the membership fee and work requirements might seem daunting to some, I find them manageable as a single person. It's important to remember that co-op membership is a shared responsibility, and for those who aren't single, it's definitely a decision that should be made together as a family.\n\nUltimately, if you resonate with Weaver's Way values, it's an incredible place to shop.

      "My visit to TDS left me feeling decidedly underwhelmed. The restaurant lacked any inviting ambiance; there were no decorative elements, menus displayed prominently, or even proper dining tables. Instead, we were seated at plain stainless steel prep tables.  Although the staff was plentiful, their lack of uniforms or name tags contributed to a sterile and impersonal feeling.  \n\nWhile the food was reasonably priced and mostly satisfying, a frustrating incident occurred when we were charged extra for additional salsa. We had ordered a salsa trio, consisting of three small samples, and when my brother requested more to complement his tacos, we were informed that we would have to purchase the entire trio again. This felt particularly unreasonable considering the substantial nature of our order, which included numerous tacos, burritos, guacamole, and drinks, amounting to over $40. In the end, despite the decent food, the lackluster atmosphere and the unexpected charge for salsa have made it unlikely that I'll return to TDS. \n\n\n\n"

The hotel's lobby was charming, and the bar and restaurant boasted a stylish ambiance that drew admiration.  I was already impressed by the hotel's usual amenities - a sophisticated yet comfortable atmosphere, friendly staff, and a sense of playful luxury.  \n\nI checked in early, eager to tackle some work before my friend's arrival. I settled into my room, ordered room service, and focused on my tasks for a solid four hours. After wrapping up my work, I ventured out to pick up a bottle of wine and enjoy a manicure and pedicure.\n\nMy friend arrived, and we were ready to fully embrace the vibrant energy of New Orleans.  We indulged in a delicious dinner, returned to the hotel giggling, and that's when we encountered our first, and biggest, problem: a gigantic cockroach, brazenly flying across the room. I was horrified!  I immediately left the room and rushed to the front desk, terrified by the possibility of more lurking in the shadows. \n\nThe staff assured me they would dispatch a maintenance worker, but I was unconvinced. I knew this was not a solitary pest; its boldness suggested a larger infestation. They offered us a different room, but their solution was unacceptable. The new room, they said, wouldn't be ready until 8 am. To our dismay, the new room wasn't any better. It had small spiders, dead insects in the corners, a malfunctioning TV, and even a lamp without light bulbs!\n\nBy 3 am, I was exhausted and deeply unsettled. I knew I wouldn't be staying past 8:15 am.  The thought of leaving my belongings in such a condition was simply unbearable.  I quickly booked us a room at The W, my usual go-to hotel,  for the rest of our trip.\n\nDespite our frustration, we waited until 8 am to see if a manager would address our concerns. No one came to our room, so I went down to demand an audience. A young man approached us, apologized, and offered a refund. I accepted his apology and politely requested a full refund.

      "The single-star reviews for this place leave me dumbfounded.  Here's why:  Potito's serves the absolute best cannoli in the city, hands down. Even renowned spots like Termini's and Isgro's pale in comparison.  This has made Potito's my cannoli haven, my one and only source for these treats.  \n\nI make it a tradition to visit every Christmas Eve, and I plan to keep this ritual going for years to come.

      "The single-star reviews for this place completely baffle me. Allow me to explain why.\n\nIn my view, Potito's serves the best cannoli in the entire city. Forget Termini's and Isgro's, those famous names simply can't compare to the quality of Potito's. Potito's has become my cannoli haven, the only place I'd consider going. I make it a ritual to visit every Christmas Eve, a tradition I plan to keep for years to come.\n\nThis year, I witnessed firsthand the massive crowds at Isgro's, waiting two hours for a tiramisu.

While some reviewers have found the pizza lacking, I haven't had the same experience. However, I have enjoyed everything else I've tried:\n\n* **The Quaker (Chicken Version):** This dish is a winner! I appreciate their use of chunky chicken instead of shredded. The cheese melts perfectly, and the vegetables are always fresh.  A little more seasoning on the chicken wouldn't hurt.\n* **The Fries:** Crispy and flavorful, these fries are so good they don't even need ketchup—a testament to their quality!\n* **The Onion Rings:** Lightly greasy but undeniably tasty and crisp. The onions stay perfectly encased in the breading.\n* **Spanakopita:**  A touch overcooked this time, but the flavors were still delicious.\n* **Baklava:** Absolutely fantastic!\n* **Signature Salad:** The freshness of the vegetables is crucial to a great salad, and this one shines. Their balsamic vinaigrette is also excellent.\n* **(Turkey) Greek Burger:** One of the best turkey burgers I've ever had! Juicy and flavorful on its own, it's elevated by a homemade tzatziki sauce that I could eat by the bowlful. My burger came with romaine instead of the advertised arugula, but it was so fresh that I didn't mind.

Despite reading positive reviews, I decided to give them another chance to understand the hype. Unfortunately, my second attempt was equally frustrating. \n\nThe food was a mixed bag, with some dishes hitting the mark and others falling flat. While the BBQ sauce was delicious and the macaroni salad offered a unique twist, the pulled pork was moist and flavorful. However, the chicken was incredibly dry, bordering on inedible even with the generous sauce. The macaroni and cheese seemed to have been sitting on the steam table for days, and the collard greens lacked any significant flavor.\n\nThe biggest downfall of Trust Me BBQ, however, was the abysmal service. The cashier remained silent, expressionless, and completely disengaged. It felt more like ordering from a vending machine than interacting with a human being.  To add insult to injury, he didn't even listen to our order, resulting in incorrect sides being served.

      "Despite positive online reviews, my experience at this establishment was disappointing. Their website, lacking clear menu information, offered only brief descriptions of their offerings without prices.  It took some digging to find the menu, requiring me to select a location and scroll to the bottom. Even the descriptions were scant, failing to explain what constituted a \"combo\" (which simply meant cheese was added).\n\nThe table placecard provided more detailed descriptions than the website. Upon entering, I found the atmosphere more akin to a bar than a restaurant, though tables were available.  Unable to decide, I opted for the roast beef and roast pork combos, priced at $6.85 each.\n\nService was quick, but the temperature of the sandwiches was inconsistent. The roast beef arrived cold while the roast pork was hot, raising concerns about proper food handling.
