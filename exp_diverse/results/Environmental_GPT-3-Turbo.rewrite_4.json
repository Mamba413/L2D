A robust workforce is also ready to mobilize to affected areas as needed, ensuring the company can fulfill its contractual obligations to policyholders.\n\nThe Insurance Group's geographic exposure primarily includes brush fires in California and the western states, convective storms and hail in midwestern states such as Oklahoma, Kansas, eastern Colorado, Indiana, and Ohio, and hurricane risks in New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Delaware. Notably, it does not directly underwrite policies in the Gulf Coast or lower-Atlantic states, significantly reducing its hurricane exposure compared to many other insurance providers.\n\n\n\n",
      "The Insurance Group, specializing in personal lines insurance, understands the significant impact climate and weather events can have on its business.  The company's product offerings, underwriting procedures, pricing strategies, and reinsurance solutions are all carefully designed to address the potential frequency and severity of large-scale losses caused by weather or climate change.  \n\nTo make informed decisions, the company utilizes advanced modeling and loss trend monitoring to guide its strategic planning.\n\nCalifornia has faced increasing challenges in recent years due to prolonged drought conditions and the long-term effects of climate change on forests and grasslands, leading to a heightened risk of wildfires.  In response, the Insurance Group is seeking approval for a new homeowners rating plan that will leverage ISO's Fireline tool for more accurate risk assessment and pricing in wildfire-prone areas.\n\nRecognizing the evolving nature of climate risk, the Insurance Group integrates climate risk considerations into all aspects of its insurance and operational frameworks. The company dedicates significant resources to managing its exposure to catastrophic events, continually reviewing and updating disaster response plans based on the latest insights and technology.\n\nThe Insurance Group also prioritizes operational resilience to ensure it can fulfill its obligations to policyholders in the event of weather-related disruptions.  The company maintains geographically dispersed resources and contingency plans to swiftly restore operations. It also has a robust workforce that can be mobilized to affected areas as needed.\n\nGeographically, the Insurance Group's primary exposures include:\n\n* **Brush fires:** California and the western states.\n* **Convective storms and hail:** Midwestern states such as Oklahoma, Kansas, eastern Colorado, Indiana, and Ohio.\n* **Hurricanes:** New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Delaware.\n\n\nIt's important to note that the Insurance Group does not underwrite directly in the Gulf Coast or lower-Atlantic states, significantly reducing its hurricane exposure compared to many other insurers. \n\n\n\n\n"

Currently, climate risks are categorized under Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability.\n\nDespite these proactive measures, Cambia has not yet identified any climate-related risks that would jeopardize the achievement of its strategic objectives. \n\nHowever, the potential for increased morbidity rates due to climate change is a significant concern for Cambia's health insurance operations. The company closely monitors shifts in morbidity risks, comparing them to their pricing assumptions.  Furthermore, Cambia diligently assesses potential risks or impairments to its investment portfolio.\n\nWhile a dedicated climate change risk assessment is not currently integrated into their asset management practices, Cambia conducts regular reviews of its investment portfolio to evaluate a wide range of risks and potential impacts.  This comprehensive approach includes examining liquidity, capital needs, and income requirements, ensuring they can effectively meet the needs of their members, even in the face of potential future costs and impacts, including those associated with climate change.

This impact may manifest as rising average morbidity rates, which are closely monitored through established risk management practices and compared against pricing assumptions.\n\nCambia also actively monitors risks and impairments within its investment portfolio. While asset management does not have a dedicated risk assessment focused solely on climate change, climate-related considerations are integrated into routine investment risk assessments and risk tolerance setting processes.\n\nMaintaining strong surplus levels is paramount for Cambia, as it ensures the organization's ability to meet its members' needs, even in the face of potential future costs and impacts associated with climate change or other unforeseen risks. \n\n\n\n"

To prioritize RI engagements, AXA has established a dedicated RI committee responsible for developing a RI tool and assessing investment decisions.  For more information on the committee's projects, please visit: http://www.axa.com/en/responsibility/shareholders-esg-risk-management/responsible-investment.\n\nAXA's commitment to RI is further demonstrated by its signing of the UN Principles for Responsible Investments (PRI) in 2013 and its development of a global methodology for ESG footprinting in 2014. This methodology incorporates climate change risks into AXA's overall investment process.\n\n**Mitigating Risks:**\n\n* **Corporate Fixed Maturities:** AXA utilizes an issuer exposure limit framework and regular industry exposure monitoring to mitigate risks.\n* **Commercial and Agricultural Mortgages:**  Bottom-up underwriting guidelines, comprehensive collateral evaluations, and broad geographical diversification are employed to minimize exposure to regional variations caused by climate change.\n\n**Carbon Footprint and Energy Transition:**\n\n* **Montréal Pledge:** AXA signed the Montréal Pledge in May 2015, committing to assess and disclose the carbon intensity of its investments by December 2015. This initiative has already been implemented for equities, corporate fixed income, and sovereign fixed income. AXA aims to analyze \"carbon capex\" data in future assessments.\n* **Renewable Energy Investments:** AXA US recognizes carbon as a risk and supports the global energy transition. As of December 31, 2015, AXA Equitable had approximately $133 million invested in renewable and alternative energy related investments. \n\n* **Divestment from Thermal Coal:** AXA Equitable divested from, and will refrain from investing in, publicly traded mining and power generating companies deriving over 50% of their turnover from thermal coal held in the general account.\n\n**Transparency and Reporting:**\n\nAXA's commitment to climate risk management is further showcased in its CDP 2016 Report, submitted to ClimateRiskSurvey@insurance.ca.gov.\n\n\n **Note:** Exhibit 2, referred to in the original text, is not included in this rewrite.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other requests.\n"

Optimizing Office Space:**\n\n* **Space Efficiency Standards:**  We have revised our corporate standards to promote space efficiency. Recent office renovations have enabled a 40% reduction in office space per employee through these revised standards and the more efficient use of conference rooms. \n* **Energy Savings:** This substantial reduction in office space will contribute significantly to a decrease in energy usage.\n\n**4. Additional Sustainability Initiatives:**\n\n* **Responsible Waste Management:** Paper records are securely destroyed in an environmentally responsible manner.\n* **Recycling Program:**  We have implemented a comprehensive recycling program.

Optimized Office Space:**\n\n* We revised our corporate standards to improve space efficiency, leading to a 40% reduction in office space per employee through renovations and more efficient conference room utilization.\n* This reduction in office space contributes to a significant decrease in energy usage. \n* The implementation of this optimization is ongoing as office changes occur.\n\n**4.  Waste Reduction and Recycling:**\n\n* Recycling receptacles are strategically placed in individual offices and common areas throughout all offices.\n* Employees are strongly encouraged to recycle glass, cans, plastic, and paper products. \n* Toner cartridges from printers and copy machines are also recycled.\n\n**5. Energy Efficiency Measures:**\n\n* Automatic on/off light switches have been installed in offices and conference rooms.\n* High-efficiency light bulbs are used in offices wherever practical.\n* Employees are advised to turn off computers when not in use.\n\n**6.

Paper Reduction and Electronic Filing:**\n\n- We've transitioned to electronic filing whenever possible, leading to a 30% reduction in paper usage in 2017 compared to the previous year.\n\n- This initiative has continued to yield positive results, with 2019 showing even lower paper consumption, resulting in a cumulative reduction of approximately 50%.\n\n**3.  Optimized Office Space:**\n\n-  We've revised our corporate standards to improve space efficiency, leading to a 40% reduction in office space per employee through renovations and the implementation of more efficient conference room layouts.\n\n- This reduction is made possible in part by the individual desk video phone capabilities mentioned earlier.\n\n- The optimized office space will contribute to significant energy savings. This initiative is ongoing and being implemented as office renovations occur.\n\n**4.  Additional Environmental Practices:**\n\nIn addition to these core initiatives, we have implemented several other sustainability practices:\n\n-  Environmentally safe destruction of paper records when required.\n\n-  Recycling receptacles in all offices and common areas, encouraging employees to recycle glass, cans, plastic, and paper.\n\n-  Recycling of toner cartridges from printers and copy machines.\n\n-  Installation of automatic on/off light switches in offices and conference rooms.\n\n-  Encouragement of mass transit use where available.\n\n-  Promotion of telecommuting options for employees.\n\n-  Use of high-efficiency light bulbs where practical.\n\n-  Employee reminders to turn off computers when not in use.\n\n-  Established scanning practices to decrease paper documents in offices.\n\n-  Offering electronic payment options to customers to reduce mail volume.\n\n\n\n\n"
