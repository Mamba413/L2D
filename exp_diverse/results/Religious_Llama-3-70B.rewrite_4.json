      "Even in death, there's no guarantee of universal sorrow. While some may grieve, others might secretly rejoice at the passing of a loved one, especially if they perceived that person as a burden.  \n\nTake, for instance, a virtuous and wise individual. Even among those who benefited from their teachings, some might feel a sense of relief at their demise. They might think, \"Finally, I'm free from this constant scrutiny.\" Though the person might not have been overtly oppressive, their inner judgment might have weighed heavily on them.  \n\nReflecting on this, the author contemplates the many who might be glad to see them gone.  This realization, they argue, should make death less daunting. It underscores the reality that even those closest to us might harbor secret desires for our departure, believing they'll be happier without us.\n\nHowever, the author emphasizes that death should not diminish one's kindness and compassion. Even as we leave this world, we should remain loving and caring towards those we leave behind. We should continue to be their friends, offer well wishes, and approach them with gentleness and meekness.\n\nUltimately, the author advocates for a peaceful and accepting death, much like those who experience a swift and painless passing. Our separation from loved ones should be natural and effortless, akin to parting with friends and family without resistance or sorrow. This, they conclude, is a testament to the natural order of things.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other text you'd like me to rewrite.\n\n",

He never bothered us much, but I know deep down he disapproved of us.\" This is how even the good are perceived by some.\n\nBut think of yourself: how many yearn for your departure? Ponder this when facing death, realizing that those closest to you, whom you've supported, prayed for, and cared for, might secretly wish you gone, hoping for a happier life after your death. What reason would anyone have to cling to life?\n\nHowever, even in death, remain kind and loving. Continue to see your friends, offer well wishes, and treat them with gentleness. Yet, don't let this kindness lessen your desire to die.\n\nAim for a swift and peaceful passing, where your soul separates from your body quickly, just as nature intended. Like those who die easily, accept this separation from your loved ones without resistance or reluctance. We are born together, but nature dictates our parting. I am ready to depart as a friend bids farewell, without any compulsion or sorrow. For this, too, is the way of nature. \n\n\n\n\nYou did a great job rewriting the text!

But even Trajan's reign, with its grandeur and accomplishments, has become a distant memory.\n\nLook further back, across the vast expanse of history, and witness entire nations rise and fall. Empires crumble, leaving behind only echoes of their former glory. Consider the countless individuals who dedicated their lives to worldly pursuits, only to vanish without a trace, their names lost to time.\n\nReflect on those you've known personally, consumed by insignificant matters while neglecting their true selves. Let their stories serve as a reminder to prioritize your actions. Approach each task with a sense of proportion, focusing your energy on what truly matters. This way, you will avoid becoming overwhelmed by trivial concerns, and instead, find peace and fulfillment in a life well-lived.\n\n\n\n\n"
