Rev. Lett. {\\bf 76}, 224, 1996), this study presents a generalized theory of turbulent thermal diffusion applicable to a wider range of temperature gradients and Stokes numbers.\n\nTo validate this expanded theory in turbulent flows with strong stratification, laboratory experiments were conducted utilizing both oscillating grid turbulence and multi-fan turbulence.\n\nThe experimental findings, obtained at high Reynolds numbers, demonstrate that the ratio of effective particle velocity to vertical turbulent velocity remains below 1. Furthermore, both the effective velocity and the coefficient of turbulent thermal diffusion exhibit an increasing trend with Stokes numbers, reaching a peak at low values before declining for higher Stokes numbers.

Chains with c <= 2 remain permanently folded, while those with c > 2.479 are always unfolded.\n\n* **Force-Induced Melting:** A force-induced melting transition with unique behavior is possible for all loop exponents less than 2.479. This phenomenon can be experimentally verified using single-molecule force spectroscopy.\n\n**Implications for Double-Stranded Nucleic Acids:**\n\nThese findings have profound implications for understanding the hybridization and denaturation of double-stranded nucleic acids. The traditional Poland-Scheraga model assumes no base pairing within the same strand during denaturation. However, when intra-strand base pairing is allowed, our model predicts the formation of secondary structures within single strands for realistic loop exponents (c ~ 2.1). This leads to a lower melting temperature for the double helix compared to the Poland-Scheraga prediction.\n\nFurthermore, these secondary structures modify the effective loop exponent (c^) that governs the weight of a denatured region within the double strand. This, in turn, impacts the universal characteristics of the duplex melting transition.\n\n\n\n\n",

Employing a theoretical framework for nucleic acid secondary structures that incorporates the logarithmic entropy contribution (c ln m) for a loop of length m, we investigate homopolymeric single-stranded nucleic acid chains under the influence of external force and varying temperatures.\n\nIn the thermodynamic limit of an infinitely long strand, the chain undergoes a phase transition between a compact (folded) state at low temperatures and low forces, and a molten (unfolded) state at high temperatures and high forces. We derive analytically the impact of the loop exponent (c) on phase diagrams, critical exponents, melting behavior, and force-extension curves. Interestingly, for vanishing pulling force, a melting transition is only possible within a restricted range of loop exponents (2 < c < 2.479). For loop exponents less than or equal to 2, the chain remains perpetually in the folded phase, while for exponents exceeding 2.479, it is always in the unfolded state.\n\nHowever, a force-induced melting transition exhibiting singular behavior is possible for all loop exponents less than 2.479 and can be experimentally verified using single molecule force spectroscopy.

      "This research delves into the realm of space-time symmetries by analyzing actions derived from two distinct physical models: a massive, freely moving relativistic particle and a system governed by Galilean mechanics. Utilizing the framework of canonical space, we systematically uncover all symmetries present in the post-Galilean action. This comprehensive analysis leads to the identification of a diverse family of generalized Schr\\\"odinger algebras, characterized by an integer parameter M. Notably, these algebras include the familiar Schr\\\"odinger algebra at M=0.  The study then extends to explore the corresponding Schr\\\"odinger equations, their solutions, and the intriguing phenomenon of projective phases. \n\n\n Rewritten text:\n\nThis research"

      "Contrastive learning has emerged as a powerful technique for self-supervised representation learning in the spatio-temporal domain. While previous methods typically relied on naively sampling different video clips to form positive and negative pairs, this approach inadvertently biases the model towards background information. \n\nThis bias stems from two key factors. Firstly, the difference between scene backgrounds is often more visually apparent and easier to distinguish than subtle motion variations. Secondly, clips extracted from the same video frequently share similar backgrounds but exhibit distinct motions. Treating these clips as positive pairs inadvertently encourages the model to prioritize static background information over dynamic motion patterns.\n\nTo address this challenge, this paper introduces a novel dual contrastive learning framework.  This framework separates the input RGB video sequence into two complementary components: the static scene and the dynamic motion.  The resulting RGB features are then pulled closer to corresponding representations of the static scene and dynamic motion, respectively. This dual encoding strategy ensures that both static scene and dynamic motion information are effectively captured within the compact RGB representation.\n\nFurther enhancing the decoupling of static and dynamic features, the authors employ activation maps within the feature space. This technique effectively distills static- and dynamic-related features, strengthening the separation of these two crucial aspects of video content.  The proposed method, termed Dual Contrastive Learning for Spatio-temporal Representation (DCLR), demonstrates significant performance gains.

The unique stabilization of this ground state is attributed to the strong 4f-4f direct mixing between neighboring Ce atoms.

A key focus of this challenge lies in the tachocline, a small but crucial region where the Sun's rotation transitions from differential to solid body rotation. This transition is fundamental to the Sun's behavior, including its magnetic dynamo.\n\nDespite progress in solar modeling, there are still gaps in our knowledge of the tachocline, particularly regarding the profile of sound speeds within it. This paper proposes a novel approach: leveraging helioseismology to better understand the tachocline through inversions of the Ledoux discriminant. \n\nBy comparing these inversions across various solar models, we aim to identify the factors contributing to the differences between theoretical predictions and actual observations of the Sun. \n\n\nLet me know if you have any other texts you'd like me to rewrite!\n\n"

This electrostatic compression effect was identified as the primary contributor to the observed decrease in the work function.\n\nThis study highlights the significant impact of Mg doping on the structural and electronic properties of MgO/Ag(001) ultrathin films, offering valuable insights into the design and optimization of materials for various applications.\n\n**Changes Made:**\n\n* **Title:**  A more informative and specific title was added.\n* **Structure:** The text was reorganized into distinct paragraphs with clear topic sentences, improving readability and flow.\n* **Vocabulary:**  More precise scientific terminology was used, enhancing clarity and accuracy.\n*",

      "Glasses and amorphous solids exhibit gradual changes in certain properties over time, a phenomenon known as \"aging.\" These changes can manifest as variations in light scattering, electrical relaxation, or the material's ability to recover its shape after deformation. This aging process is particularly pronounced around the glass transition temperature.\n\nTo illustrate this, let's consider the example of electrical relaxation. The Lorentz model, which describes the electrical properties of materials, can be reframed to focus on the vibrational modes of particles within the material. \n\nInterestingly, near the glass transition temperature, where the material's ability to stretch and flow changes, the electrical relaxation exhibits a distinct pattern with values ranging from 0.56 to 0.65. This range aligns with experimental observations. Moreover, this slow decay in properties is linked to specific vibrational modes of the material's particles. \n\n\nLet me know if you have any other text you'd like me to rewrite.\n\n"
