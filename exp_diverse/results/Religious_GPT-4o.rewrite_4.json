This distinction is highlighted by a Jewish tradition, found in the Abodah Zarah and Sabbath Tracts, which describes God covering the Israelites with the mountain like a roof. This imagery, stemming from Exodus 19:17, illustrates the immense presence of God during the giving of the law. \n\nAccording to this tradition, recounted by Rabbi Avdimi in the Sabbath Tract, God asked the Israelites to accept the law, warning them that if they refused, the mountain would become their tomb.

This tradition, which posits that God threatened to bury the Israelites beneath the mountain if they rejected the law, is still upheld by Jewish communities today, as noted in D. Lewis Pent.
