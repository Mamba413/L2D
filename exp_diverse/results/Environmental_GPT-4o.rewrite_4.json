Additionally, we have a large workforce that can be redeployed to affected areas as needed.\n\nGeographically, our brush fire exposure is concentrated in California and the western states. Convective storms and hail pose the greatest risk in the midwestern states, including Oklahoma, Kansas, eastern Colorado, Indiana, and Ohio. Hurricane risk is primarily concentrated in New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Delaware.

These measures encompass an information technology backup data center and a fully equipped backup office site situated approximately 6 miles from our headquarters. This alternative site can accommodate critical personnel in the event our primary headquarters becomes inaccessible.\n\nAdditionally, we maintain two contracted backup print and mail processing facilities strategically located approximately 700 miles from our headquarters.

We've significantly enhanced our communication capabilities, leading to a substantial reduction in business travel. The installation of telepresence video conference rooms and individual desk video conferencing telephones in our main offices has been instrumental in achieving this. As a result, business travel decreased by 24% in 2018 compared to 2017, with this lower level maintained throughout 2019. This reduction, particularly impactful given our frequent transatlantic flights, significantly contributes to minimizing our carbon footprint.\n\nFurthermore, we've embraced paperless practices through electronic filing, resulting in a remarkable 30% reduction in paper use in 2017 compared to the previous year. This trend continued, culminating in a 50% cumulative reduction by 2019.\n\nOur commitment to efficient resource utilization extends to our office layout. By optimizing space and incorporating video conferencing capabilities, we've achieved a 40% reduction in office space per employee and enhanced conference room utilization. These changes translate into significant energy savings. While not all offices are fully updated, these renovations are ongoing.\n\nWe are dedicated to responsible waste management. We ensure environmentally safe destruction of paper records and provide recycling bins throughout our offices and common areas. Employees are actively encouraged to recycle glass, cans, plastic, and paper. Toner cartridges are also recycled, and we've implemented automatic on/off light switches to conserve energy.\n\nTo further minimize our environmental impact, we promote the use of mass transit and telecommuting whenever possible.

      "RQIH, a company like many others, relies on expert managers through discretionary mandates to handle its investment portfolio. These mandates are governed by IMAs and closely monitored using tools like Clearwater and regular investment reports. Both managers entrusted by RQIH demonstrate a strong commitment to Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles. Their ESG policies, which address climate change, are regularly reviewed and detailed information is available upon request.\n\nP&R, one of RQIH's investment managers, takes a comprehensive approach to ESG integration. They utilize the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) industry standards to evaluate issuers and leverage MSCI ESG Research and Bloomberg for data analysis.  Furthermore, they partner with Glass Lewis, a proxy voting firm, to monitor the ESG performance of portfolio companies.  P&R's ESG strategy prioritizes climate change considerations and favors companies and governments with policies aimed at mitigating its impacts.  \n\nThis dedication to ESG has earned P&R an impressive A+ rating, the highest score, from the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (UN PRI) for their ESG screening efforts.\n\nGTAM, the other investment manager selected by RQIH, employs its proprietary software, PRISM, to track ESG factors. They also adhere to SASB standards and align with UN PRI guidelines. GTAM's commitment to ESG extends to their support of various investment tools and bodies, including the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures and the Transition Pathway Initiative, which focuses on reducing emissions in line with the Paris Agreement.\n\nWhile RQIH hasn't explicitly instructed their investment managers to alter their portfolio management strategies to prioritize ESG, the Group remains satisfied with the current ESG policies in place and is actively developing its own dedicated ESG approach.\n\n\n\n"
