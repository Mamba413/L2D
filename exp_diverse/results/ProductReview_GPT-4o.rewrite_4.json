We chose a small table near the bar and informed the waiter of our intention to only have drinks. Instead of a warm welcome, we received a reluctant \"I guess it would be fine\" and a hurried retreat. Throughout the evening, his behavior remained distant and unwelcoming, leaving us with a sense of being inconvenienced.\n\nThe situation escalated when we requested to split the bill due to company policy. This simple request was met with an air of annoyance, further compounding our negative experience. \n\nDetermined to give the restaurant another chance, we returned the following night, ensuring that the problematic waiter was not on duty. This time, a friendly and engaging bartender named Ben completely redeemed the establishment. He was attentive, knowledgeable, and genuinely interested in creating a positive experience. Ben's professionalism and charisma were a stark contrast to our previous encounter, showcasing the difference a dedicated staff member can make. \n\nFurthermore, I ordered room service from the restaurant on my final night and was impressed by the quality of the food.

While it's not designed for quick, everyday convenience shopping, I, as a single woman, find it incredibly easy to navigate, even during peak hours. In fact, I see it as a perfect fit for singles like me because it allows me to purchase smaller quantities of items, something that's often difficult in larger chain stores like Acme.\n\nBeyond the shopping experience, I appreciate the flexible work hours. I've had the opportunity to work in various departments, and currently, I'm contributing to the membership committee.  \n\nContrary to the stereotype of \"tree huggers\" and \"earth children,\" the Weaver's Way community is incredibly diverse, bringing together individuals from various backgrounds who share a common commitment to ethical and sustainable practices.\n\nWhat truly sets Weaver's Way apart is its focus on locally sourced produce, natural and wholesome foods free from preservatives, and competitive prices that are significantly lower than Whole Foods. I love interacting with fellow members and actively participating in both my local and global community.\n\nWhile the membership fee and work requirements might seem daunting to some, I find them manageable as a single person. It's important to remember that co-op membership is a shared responsibility, and for those who aren't single, it's definitely a decision that should be made together as a family.\n\nUltimately, if you resonate with Weaver's Way values, it's an incredible place to shop. However, if you're looking for a purely convenient shopping experience, sticking to chain stores or visiting as a guest paying the 10% fee might be a better option.\n\n\n\n",

      "As a devoted Weaver's Way member, I strongly disagree with the negative sentiments expressed in some previous reviews. This isn't a typical convenience store; it's a cooperative focused on quality, sustainability, and community. \n\nDespite being a single woman, I find shopping at Weaver's Way effortless, whether during peak hours or not. In fact, I appreciate the co-op's ability to offer smaller quantities of goods, perfect for individuals like myself who live alone. This contrasts with larger chain stores like Acme, which often force bulk purchases. I've also found the work hours to be flexible and rewarding. I've held various positions within the store, and currently contribute to the membership committee.\n\nWhile some might portray the Weaver's Way community as solely composed of \"tree huggers\" and \"earth children,\" the reality is far more diverse. It's a gathering place for individuals from various backgrounds who share a common commitment to ethical and sustainable practices.\n\nI value Weaver's Way for its emphasis on locally sourced produce, natural, wholesome foods free from preservatives, and competitive prices that significantly undercut Whole Foods.  The opportunity to interact with fellow members and contribute to both the local and global community is truly enriching. \n\nThe membership fee and work requirements are manageable, even for a single person. It's important to note that co-op membership isn't for everyone, and if you aren't part of a household, it's a decision best made collectively. However, if you resonate with Weaver's Way values, it's an exceptional place to shop. Otherwise, consider visiting occasionally as a paying guest or exploring other options. \n\n\n\n",
      "As a devoted member of Weaver's Way, I strongly disagree with some criticisms leveled at the co-op in past reviews. While Weaver's Way may not be the ideal choice for quick, convenience shopping, it caters perfectly to individuals like myself - a single woman - who appreciate its unique advantages. \n\nI find navigating the store, even during peak hours, to be effortless.  Weaver's Way excels in offering smaller quantities of products, a boon for single shoppers like me who often struggle to utilize larger quantities found in corporate stores like Acme.  \n\nBeyond shopping, I've actively participated in the co-op's community, contributing my time to the membership committee. The co-op's membership is far from homogenous, encompassing a diverse range of individuals with shared values, spanning various backgrounds. \n\nWhat truly sets Weaver's Way apart is its commitment to local, sustainably grown produce, natural, wholesome foods, and a focus on minimizing preservatives. Their prices, significantly lower than Whole Foods, make healthy choices accessible. \n\nThe opportunity to connect with fellow members and contribute to both my local and global community is immensely rewarding.  The membership fee and work hour requirements, while a consideration for anyone, are not prohibitive for individuals like myself.\n\nIt's important to acknowledge that co-op membership isn't for everyone, especially those in multi-person households. It requires a shared commitment and decision within a family.  \n\nHowever, for those who resonate with Weaver's Way's core values, it's an invaluable resource and community. If those values don't align, traditional chain stores or occasional visits as a guest (with a 10% surcharge) might be more suitable.\"\n\n\n"

This hotel, however, promised a unique experience, nestled right in the heart of the city.\n\nHesitantly, I entered the upscale hotel lobby with my striking Labrador/Golden Retriever mix, Bentley. Despite my boyfriend's reassurances, a knot of apprehension lingered in my stomach.  The moment we reached the front desk, the reception staff's warmth and friendliness instantly melted away my worries.\n\nAs we completed the check-in process, an attentive attendant inquired about Bentley's preferences, offering her a delightful assortment of treats, which she devoured with gusto. To our delight, the receptionist then presented us with a welcome kit specially curated for Bentley, complete with dog dishes, a cozy mat, an abundance of treats, and more.  I was truly impressed by this thoughtful gesture.\n\nOur stay was further enhanced by the genuine interactions with other guests, who showered Bentley with affectionate compliments and pets, earning her the title of \"Queen Bentley\" in their eyes.\n\nOur room, situated on the top floor, offered breathtaking views. Even during our walks, the car attendants greeted Bentley by name, demonstrating the exceptional level of personalized service.\n\nWe were so captivated by the hotel's commitment to canine comfort that we extended our stay by an extra night. A heartfelt thank you to Loews for exceeding our expectations and proving that a hotel can be a truly welcoming haven for both humans and their four-legged companions. \n\n\n\n",

      "Last year, my friends and I embarked on a girls' trip to New Orleans, choosing The Saint as our accommodation. The hotel's lobby was charming, and the bar and restaurant boasted a stylish ambiance that drew admiration.  I was already impressed by the hotel's usual amenities - a sophisticated yet comfortable atmosphere, friendly staff, and a sense of playful luxury.  \n\nI checked in early, eager to tackle some work before my friend's arrival. I settled into my room, ordered room service, and focused on my tasks for a solid four hours. After wrapping up my work, I ventured out to pick up a bottle of wine and enjoy a manicure and pedicure.\n\nMy friend arrived, and we were ready to fully embrace the vibrant energy of New Orleans.  We indulged in a delicious dinner, returned to the hotel giggling, and that's when we encountered our first, and biggest, problem: a gigantic cockroach, brazenly flying across the room. I was horrified!  I immediately left the room and rushed to the front desk, terrified by the possibility of more lurking in the shadows. \n\nThe staff assured me they would dispatch a maintenance worker, but I was unconvinced. I knew this was not a solitary pest; its boldness suggested a larger infestation. They offered us a different room, but their solution was unacceptable. The new room, they said, wouldn't be ready until 8 am. To our dismay, the new room wasn't any better. It had small spiders, dead insects in the corners, a malfunctioning TV, and even a lamp without light bulbs!\n\nBy 3 am, I was exhausted and deeply unsettled. I knew I wouldn't be staying past 8:15 am.  The thought of leaving my belongings in such a condition was simply unbearable.  I quickly booked us a room at The W, my usual go-to hotel,  for the rest of our trip.\n\nDespite our frustration, we waited until 8 am to see if a manager would address our concerns. No one came to our room, so I went down to demand an audience. A young man approached us, apologized, and offered a refund. I accepted his apology and politely requested a full refund. He agreed and even asked us to consider returning after the necessary changes were made.  However, I politely declined. After this experience, I knew I wouldn't be back. \n\n\n\n",

I insisted on a different room, expressing my concern about the potential presence of more roaches. While they agreed to send a maintenance worker, I wasn't satisfied.  \n\nThe provided alternative room was hardly better. We found small spiders and dead insects in the corners of the window, the TV wasn't working, and one of the lamps lacked bulbs. It was around 3 am at this point, and I knew we couldn't stay another minute.

      "Last year, my friends and I embarked on a girls' trip to New Orleans, choosing The Saint as our accommodation. The hotel's ambiance impressed us from the moment we stepped into the lovely lobby, complete with a chic bar and restaurant. Everything felt luxurious and inviting, exactly what we expected from a high-end hotel.\n\nChecking in early, I set up my laptop in the room, ordered room service, and dedicated a few hours to work while my friend was still on her way.  However, our weekend took a turn for the worse upon her arrival.   \n\nWe returned to the room after a delightful dinner, only to be greeted by a massive cockroach, a sight that sent chills down my spine.  I immediately abandoned the room and rushed to the front desk, horrified.  They assured me a maintenance worker would address the issue, but their response wasn't reassuring. With the bold roach in sight, I feared countless others lurked unseen.\n\nThey relocated us to another room, but the new accommodations were far from ideal. We found small spiders and dead bugs in the corners of the window, the TV was non-functional, and a lamp lacked bulbs.  It was 3 a.m., and I knew I wouldn't be spending another minute in this subpar environment. \n\nDesperate for a comfortable stay, we booked a room at The W, our usual go-to hotel, for the remainder of the trip.  Despite waiting for a manager to address the situation, none appeared.  Finally, at 8 a.m., a young man emerged and apologized for the ordeal.  I thanked him for his apology but firmly requested a full refund, which he promptly provided.\n\nThough he offered the opportunity to return after improvements were made, we politely declined.  The experience left us deeply disappointed and determined to avoid The Saint in the future. \n\n\n\n",

I settled into my room, ordered room service, and worked for several hours.

Disturbed and horrified, I immediately went to the front desk.\n\nThe staff promised to send a maintenance worker, but this was not a satisfactory solution.  Knowing that one cockroach likely meant more lurking unseen, I insisted on a change of rooms. They obliged but informed me they couldn't do anything else until 8:00 AM.\n\nThe new room was equally disconcerting. We found small spiders and dead insects in the corners, the TV was broken, and one lamp lacked bulbs.

Spicy pull-and-peel shrimp, steamers, and occasionally, the challenge of blue crabs (worth the effort!), round out the must-try list.  \n\nThe restaurant's thoughtful inclusion of numerous sinks around the space makes for easy cleanup after indulging in their messy but delicious offerings.\n\nChickie's and Pete's is a quintessential Philly experience, brimming with energy and flavor. I highly recommend it for anyone visiting the city. \n\nHowever, be prepared for a potential challenge during major sporting events: securing a table can be nearly impossible, and the crowd may be a bit boisterous due to the enthusiastic (and possibly inebriated) fans. Just remember, if you go with the right mindset, you'll be part of the fun! \n\n\n\n\n",
      "Chickie's and Pete's offers the ultimate game-day atmosphere, brimming with delicious food and lively energy. While it may not be a white-tablecloth establishment, securing a seat and enjoying a beer with classic dishes like mussels red and crab fries guarantees an unforgettable experience, whether it's game day or simply a visit near the stadiums.\n\nAmong the enticing options, the crab fries and mussels red (I personally prefer the red over the sometimes-garlicky white version) stand out. The spicy pull and peel shrimp, steamers, and occasional blue crabs (which require a bit more effort but are undeniably worth it) also make for delectable choices. \n\nWhat sets Chickie's and Pete's apart is the convenience of numerous sinks scattered throughout, making cleanup a breeze after indulging in these hearty meals. \n\nA true Philly classic, Chickie's and Pete's is an absolute blast. I highly recommend experiencing this vibrant institution at least once. However, during major sporting events, be prepared for a few things: finding a table can be a challenge, and the atmosphere can be quite lively, with plenty of enthusiastic (and possibly inebriated) fans. If you're looking for a refined dining experience, this might not be the place for you. But if you're ready for a fun, no-frills, and undeniably delicious time, Chickie's and Pete's is a must-visit.\n\n\n",
      "Chickie's and Pete's is a Philadelphia institution perfect for enjoying a game alongside mouthwatering food. While it may not be a Michelin-star restaurant, the experience is undeniably fun.  Securing a seat and enjoying a beer with some of their signature dishes, like mussels red and crab fries, is a guarantee for a great time, whether it's game day or any day near the stadiums.\n\nAmong their many offerings, the crab fries and mussels red (I prefer the red over the sometimes overly garlicky white version) are standouts. I also recommend the spicy pull-and-peel shrimp, steamers, and occasionally the blue crabs (though they require some effort, they're undeniably delicious). The abundance of sinks throughout the establishment is a thoughtful touch, making it convenient to clean up after enjoying these delicious, messy dishes.\n\nIn essence, Chickie's and Pete's is a quintessential Philly experience that's always a blast. It's highly recommended, at least once. However, be aware that during major sporting events, finding a table can be near impossible and expect to encounter enthusiastic (and perhaps inebriated) fans. I've been there myself, and while it's all part of the fun, it's something to keep in mind if you're not in the mood for a lively atmosphere.\n\n\n"

Despite reading positive reviews, I decided to give them another chance to understand the hype. Unfortunately, my second attempt was equally frustrating. \n\nThe food was a mixed bag, with some dishes hitting the mark and others falling flat. While the BBQ sauce was delicious and the macaroni salad offered a unique twist, the pulled pork was moist and flavorful.

The macaroni and cheese seemed to have been sitting on the steam table for days, and the collard greens lacked any significant flavor.\n\nThe biggest downfall of Trust Me BBQ, however, was the abysmal service.

Three months ago, I took the plunge and waited patiently in line for ten minutes, only to be met with a wall of silence and no service.  Discouraged, but intrigued by the positive reviews, I decided to give it another shot.  My recent experience was a mixed bag. While the food had its redeeming qualities, the service was undeniably dreadful.  The counter staff member remained completely aloof, offering no greetings, smiles, or interaction. It felt more like ordering from a vending machine than a welcoming establishment.  Adding insult to injury, he failed to properly listen to our order, resulting in incorrect sides being included in our meals.  We had to interrupt his serving process to rectify the mistake.  \n\nDespite the culinary highs, the overall experience was soured by the lackluster service.  The BBQ sauce was a standout, boasting a delicious flavor profile.  The macaroni salad offered a unique and interesting twist, and the \"pulled\" pork was delightfully moist.  However, the chicken was disappointingly dry, bordering on inedible even with the generous application of sauce.  The mac & cheese, unfortunately, seemed to have been languishing on the steam table for days, lacking freshness and flavor.  The collard greens, while present, were disappointingly mild in flavor.\n\n\nIn the end, I'll be sticking with Down to the Bone BBQ, where both the food and service consistently deliver a satisfying experience.  \n\n\n\n\n"

      "This place is truly exceptional! From the mouthwatering food to the stellar service, everything exceeded expectations.  We started with a delightful appetizer of cheese curds served with a tangy red pepper jelly, which was absolutely delicious.  For our main courses, I savored flavorful fish tacos, while my wife enjoyed a hearty beer brat. Both dishes were generously portioned and offered excellent value for the price.  Our server was outstanding – attentive, knowledgeable about the menu, and made us feel incredibly welcomed.
