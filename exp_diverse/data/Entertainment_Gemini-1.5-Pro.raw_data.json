    "I rented I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW from my video store because of all the controversy that surrounded it when it was first released in 1967. I also heard that at first it was seized by U.S. customs if it ever tried to enter this country, therefore being a fan of films considered \"controversial\" I really had to see this for myself.<br /><br />The plot is centered around a young Swedish drama student named Lena who wants to learn everything she can about life. In particular she wants to focus her attentions to making some sort of documentary on what the average Swede thought about certain political issues such as the Vietnam War and race issues in the United States. In between asking politicians and ordinary denizens of Stockholm about their opinions on politics, she has sex with her drama teacher, classmates, and married men.<br /><br />What kills me about I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is that 40 years ago, this was considered pornographic. Really, the sex and nudity scenes are few and far between, even then it's not shot like some cheaply made porno. While my countrymen mind find it shocking, in reality sex and nudity are a major staple in Swedish cinema. Even Ingmar Bergman, arguably their answer to good old boy John Ford, had sex scenes in his films.<br /><br />I do commend the filmmakers for the fact that any sex shown in the film is shown for artistic purposes rather than just to shock people and make money to be shown in pornographic theaters in America. I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is a good film for anyone wanting to study the meat and potatoes (no pun intended) of Swedish cinema. But really, this film doesn't have much of a plot.",
    "\"I Am Curious: Yellow\" is a risible and pretentious steaming pile. It doesn't matter what one's political views are because this film can hardly be taken seriously on any level. As for the claim that frontal male nudity is an automatic NC-17, that isn't true. I've seen R-rated films with male nudity. Granted, they only offer some fleeting views, but where are the R-rated films with gaping vulvas and flapping labia? Nowhere, because they don't exist. The same goes for those crappy cable shows: schlongs swinging in the breeze but not a clitoris in sight. And those pretentious indie movies like The Brown Bunny, in which we're treated to the site of Vincent Gallo's throbbing johnson, but not a trace of pink visible on Chloe Sevigny. Before crying (or implying) \"double-standard\" in matters of nudity, the mentally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women: there are no genitals on display when actresses appears nude, and the same cannot be said for a man. In fact, you generally won't see female genitals in an American film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica. This alleged double-standard is less a double standard than an admittedly depressing ability to come to terms culturally with the insides of women's bodies.",
    "If only to avoid making this type of film in the future. This film is interesting as an experiment but tells no cogent story.<br /><br />One might feel virtuous for sitting thru it because it touches on so many IMPORTANT issues but it does so without any discernable motive. The viewer comes away with no new perspectives (unless one comes up with one while one's mind wanders, as it will invariably do during this pointless film).<br /><br />One might better spend one's time staring out a window at a tree growing.<br /><br />",
    "This film was probably inspired by Godard's Masculin, féminin and I urge you to see that film instead.<br /><br />The film has two strong elements and those are, (1) the realistic acting (2) the impressive, undeservedly good, photo. Apart from that, what strikes me most is the endless stream of silliness. Lena Nyman has to be most annoying actress in the world. She acts so stupid and with all the nudity in this film,...it's unattractive. Comparing to Godard's film, intellectuality has been replaced with stupidity. Without going too far on this subject, I would say that follows from the difference in ideals between the French and the Swedish society.<br /><br />A movie of its time, and place. 2/10.",
    "Oh, brother...after hearing about this ridiculous film for umpteen years all I can think of is that old Peggy Lee song..<br /><br />\"Is that all there is??\" ...I was just an early teen when this smoked fish hit the U.S. I was too young to get in the theater (although I did manage to sneak into \"Goodbye Columbus\"). Then a screening at a local film museum beckoned - Finally I could see this film, except now I was as old as my parents were when they schlepped to see it!!<br /><br />The ONLY reason this film was not condemned to the anonymous sands of time was because of the obscenity case sparked by its U.S. release. MILLIONS of people flocked to this stinker, thinking they were going to see a sex film...Instead, they got lots of closeups of gnarly, repulsive Swedes, on-street interviews in bland shopping malls, asinie political pretension...and feeble who-cares simulated sex scenes with saggy, pale actors.<br /><br />Cultural icon, holy grail, historic artifact..whatever this thing was, shred it, burn it, then stuff the ashes in a lead box!<br /><br />Elite esthetes still scrape to find value in its boring pseudo revolutionary political spewings..But if it weren't for the censorship scandal, it would have been ignored, then forgotten.<br /><br />Instead, the \"I Am Blank, Blank\" rhythymed title was repeated endlessly for years as a titilation for porno films (I am Curious, Lavender - for gay films, I Am Curious, Black - for blaxploitation films, etc..) and every ten years or so the thing rises from the dead, to be viewed by a new generation of suckers who want to see that \"naughty sex film\" that \"revolutionized the film industry\"...<br /><br />Yeesh, avoid like the plague..Or if you MUST see it - rent the video and fast forward to the \"dirty\" parts, just to get it over with.<br /><br />",
    "I would put this at the top of my list of films in the category of unwatchable trash! There are films that are bad, but the worst kind are the ones that are unwatchable but you are suppose to like them because they are supposed to be good for you! The sex sequences, so shocking in its day, couldn't even arouse a rabbit. The so called controversial politics is strictly high school sophomore amateur night Marxism. The film is self-consciously arty in the worst sense of the term. The photography is in a harsh grainy black and white. Some scenes are out of focus or taken from the wrong angle. Even the sound is bad! And some people call this art?<br /><br />",
    "Whoever wrote the screenplay for this movie obviously never consulted any books about Lucille Ball, especially her autobiography. I've never seen so many mistakes in a biopic, ranging from her early years in Celoron and Jamestown to her later years with Desi. I could write a whole list of factual errors, but it would go on for pages. In all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film. The filmmakers tried hard, but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me.",
    "When I first saw a glimpse of this movie, I quickly noticed the actress who was playing the role of Lucille Ball. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucy is absolutely awful. Lucille Ball was an astounding comedian with incredible talent. To think about a legend like Lucille Ball being portrayed the way she was in the movie is horrendous. I cannot believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a much better Lucy, the producers decided to get Rachel York. She might be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of Lucille Ball is tough. It is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble Lucille Ball, but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent. If you noticed York's portrayal of Lucy in episodes of I Love Lucy like the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin, nothing is similar in any way-her expression, voice, or movement.<br /><br />To top it all off, Danny Pino playing Desi Arnaz is horrible. Pino does not qualify to play as Ricky. He's small and skinny, his accent is unreal, and once again, his acting is unbelievable. Although Fred and Ethel were not similar either, they were not as bad as the characters of Lucy and Ricky.<br /><br />Overall, extremely horrible casting and the story is badly told. If people want to understand the real life situation of Lucille Ball, I suggest watching A&E Biography of Lucy and Desi, read the book from Lucille Ball herself, or PBS' American Masters: Finding Lucy. If you want to see a docudrama, \"Before the Laughter\" would be a better choice. The casting of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in \"Before the Laughter\" is much better compared to this. At least, a similar aspect is shown rather than nothing.",
    "Who are these \"They\"- the actors? the filmmakers? Certainly couldn't be the audience- this is among the most air-puffed productions in existence. It's the kind of movie that looks like it was a lot of fun to shoot TOO much fun, nobody is getting any actual work done, and that almost always makes for a movie that's no fun to watch.<br /><br />Ritter dons glasses so as to hammer home his character's status as a sort of doppleganger of the bespectacled Bogdanovich; the scenes with the breezy Ms. Stratten are sweet, but have an embarrassing, look-guys-I'm-dating-the-prom-queen feel to them. Ben Gazzara sports his usual cat's-got-canary grin in a futile attempt to elevate the meager plot, which requires him to pursue Audrey Hepburn with all the interest of a narcoleptic at an insomnia clinic. In the meantime, the budding couple's respective children (nepotism alert: Bogdanovich's daughters) spew cute and pick up some fairly disturbing pointers on 'love' while observing their parents. (Ms. Hepburn, drawing on her dignity, manages to rise above the proceedings- but she has the monumental challenge of playing herself, ostensibly.) Everybody looks great, but so what? It's a movie and we can expect that much, if that's what you're looking for you'd be better off picking up a copy of Vogue.<br /><br />Oh- and it has to be mentioned that Colleen Camp thoroughly annoys, even apart from her singing, which, while competent, is wholly unconvincing... the country and western numbers are woefully mismatched with the standards on the soundtrack. Surely this is NOT what Gershwin (who wrote the song from which the movie's title is derived) had in mind; his stage musicals of the 20's may have been slight, but at least they were long on charm. \"They All Laughed\" tries to coast on its good intentions, but nobody- least of all Peter Bogdanovich - has the good sense to put on the brakes.<br /><br />Due in no small part to the tragic death of Dorothy Stratten, this movie has a special place in the heart of Mr. Bogdanovich- he even bought it back from its producers, then distributed it on his own and went bankrupt when it didn't prove popular. His rise and fall is among the more sympathetic and tragic of Hollywood stories, so there's no joy in criticizing the film... there _is_ real emotional investment in Ms. Stratten's scenes. But \"Laughed\" is a faint echo of \"The Last Picture Show\", \"Paper Moon\" or \"What's Up, Doc\"- following \"Daisy Miller\" and \"At Long Last Love\", it was a thundering confirmation of the phase from which P.B. has never emerged.<br /><br />All in all, though, the movie is harmless, only a waste of rental. I want to watch people having a good time, I'll go to the park on a sunny day. For filmic expressions of joy and love, I'll stick to Ernest Lubitsch and Jaques Demy...",
    "This is said to be a personal film for Peter Bogdonavitch. He based it on his life but changed things around to fit the characters, who are detectives. These detectives date beautiful models and have no problem getting them. Sounds more like a millionaire playboy filmmaker than a detective, doesn't it? This entire movie was written by Peter, and it shows how out of touch with real people he was. You're supposed to write what you know, and he did that, indeed. And leaves the audience bored and confused, and jealous, for that matter. This is a curio for people who want to see Dorothy Stratten, who was murdered right after filming. But Patti Hanson, who would, in real life, marry Keith Richards, was also a model, like Stratten, but is a lot better and has a more ample part. In fact, Stratten's part seemed forced; added. She doesn't have a lot to do with the story, which is pretty convoluted to begin with. All in all, every character in this film is somebody that very few people can relate with, unless you're millionaire from Manhattan with beautiful supermodels at your beckon call. For the rest of us, it's an irritating snore fest. That's what happens when you're out of touch. You entertain your few friends with inside jokes, and bore all the rest.",
    "It was great to see some of my favorite stars of 30 years ago including John Ritter, Ben Gazarra and Audrey Hepburn. They looked quite wonderful. But that was it. They were not given any characters or good lines to work with. I neither understood or cared what the characters were doing.<br /><br />Some of the smaller female roles were fine, Patty Henson and Colleen Camp were quite competent and confident in their small sidekick parts. They showed some talent and it is sad they didn't go on to star in more and better films. Sadly, I didn't think Dorothy Stratten got a chance to act in this her only important film role.<br /><br />The film appears to have some fans, and I was very open-minded when I started watching it. I am a big Peter Bogdanovich fan and I enjoyed his last movie, \"Cat's Meow\" and all his early ones from \"Targets\" to \"Nickleodeon\". So, it really surprised me that I was barely able to keep awake watching this one.<br /><br />It is ironic that this movie is about a detective agency where the detectives and clients get romantically involved with each other. Five years later, Bogdanovich's ex-girlfriend, Cybil Shepherd had a hit television series called \"Moonlighting\" stealing the story idea from Bogdanovich. Of course, there was a great difference in that the series relied on tons of witty dialogue, while this tries to make do with slapstick and a few screwball lines.<br /><br />Bottom line: It ain't no \"Paper Moon\" and only a very pale version of \"What's Up, Doc\".",
    "I can't believe that those praising this movie herein aren't thinking of some other film. I was prepared for the possibility that this would be awful, but the script (or lack thereof) makes for a film that's also pointless. On the plus side, the general level of craft on the part of the actors and technical crew is quite competent, but when you've got a sow's ear to work with you can't make a silk purse. Ben G fans should stick with just about any other movie he's been in. Dorothy S fans should stick to Galaxina. Peter B fans should stick to Last Picture Show and Target. Fans of cheap laughs at the expense of those who seem to be asking for it should stick to Peter B's amazingly awful book, Killing of the Unicorn.",
    "Never cast models and Playboy bunnies in your films! Bob Fosse's \"Star 80\" about Dorothy Stratten, of whom Bogdanovich was obsessed enough to have married her SISTER after her murder at the hands of her low-life husband, is a zillion times more interesting than Dorothy herself on the silver screen. Patty Hansen is no actress either..I expected to see some sort of lost masterpiece a la Orson Welles but instead got Audrey Hepburn cavorting in jeans and a god-awful \"poodlesque\" hair-do....Very disappointing....\"Paper Moon\" and \"The Last Picture Show\" I could watch again and again. This clunker I could barely sit through once. This movie was reputedly not released because of the brouhaha surrounding Ms. Stratten's tawdry death; I think the real reason was because it was so bad!",
    "Its not the cast. A finer group of actors, you could not find. Its not the setting. The director is in love with New York City, and by the end of the film, so are we all! Woody Allen could not improve upon what Bogdonovich has done here. If you are going to fall in love, or find love, Manhattan is the place to go. No, the problem with the movie is the script. There is none. The actors fall in love at first sight, words are unnecessary. In the director's own experience in Hollywood that is what happens when they go to work on the set. It is reality to him, and his peers, but it is a fantasy to most of us in the real world. So, in the end, the movie is hollow, and shallow, and message-less.",
    "Today I found \"They All Laughed\" on VHS on sale in a rental. It was a really old and very used VHS, I had no information about this movie, but I liked the references listed on its cover: the names of Peter Bogdanovich, Audrey Hepburn, John Ritter and specially Dorothy Stratten attracted me, the price was very low and I decided to risk and buy it. I searched IMDb, and the User Rating of 6.0 was an excellent reference. I looked in \"Mick Martin & Marsha Porter Video & DVD Guide 2003\" and  wow  four stars! So, I decided that I could not waste more time and immediately see it. Indeed, I have just finished watching \"They All Laughed\" and I found it a very boring overrated movie. The characters are badly developed, and I spent lots of minutes to understand their roles in the story. The plot is supposed to be funny (private eyes who fall in love for the women they are chasing), but I have not laughed along the whole story. The coincidences, in a huge city like New York, are ridiculous. Ben Gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man, with the women falling for him as if her were a Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas or George Clooney, is quite ridiculous. In the end, the greater attractions certainly are the presence of the Playboy centerfold and playmate of the year Dorothy Stratten, murdered by her husband pretty after the release of this movie, and whose life was showed in \"Star 80\" and \"Death of a Centerfold: The Dorothy Stratten Story\"; the amazing beauty of the sexy Patti Hansen, the future Mrs. Keith Richards; the always wonderful, even being fifty-two years old, Audrey Hepburn; and the song \"Amigo\", from Roberto Carlos. Although I do not like him, Roberto Carlos has been the most popular Brazilian singer since the end of the 60's and is called by his fans as \"The King\". I will keep this movie in my collection only because of these attractions (manly Dorothy Stratten). My vote is four.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): \"Muito Riso e Muita Alegria\" (\"Many Laughs and Lots of Happiness\")",
    "This film is just plain horrible. John Ritter doing pratt falls, 75% of the actors delivering their lines as if they were reading them from cue cards, poor editing, horrible sound mixing (dialogue is tough to pick up in places over the background noise), and a plot that really goes nowhere. I didn't think I'd ever say this, but Dorothy Stratten is not the worst actress in this film. There are at least 3 others that suck more. Patti Hansen delivers her lines with the passion of Ben Stein. I started to wonder if she wasn't dead inside. Even Bogdanovich's kids are awful (the oldest one is definitely reading her lines from a cue card). This movie is seriously horrible. There's a reason Bogdanovich couldn't get another project until 4 years later. Please don't watch it. If you see it in your television listings, cancel your cable. If a friend suggests it to you, reconsider your friendship. If your spouse wants to watch it, you're better off finding another soulmate. I'd rather gouge my eyes out with lawn darts than sit through this piece of garbage again. If I could sum this film up in one word, that word would be: Suckotrocity",
    "My interest in Dorothy Stratten caused me to purchase this video. Although it had great actors/actresses, there were just too many subplots going on to retain interest. Plus it just wasn't that interesting. Dialogue was stiff and confusing and the story just flipped around too much to be believable. I was pretty disappointed in what I believe was one of Audrey Hepburn's last movies. I'll always love John Ritter best in slapstick. He was just too pathetic here.",
    "I think I will make a movie next weekend. Oh wait, I'm working..oh I'm sure I can fit it in. It looks like whoever made this film fit it in. I hope the makers of this crap have day jobs because this film sucked!!! It looks like someones home movie and I don't think more than $100 was spent making it!!! Total crap!!! Who let's this stuff be released?!?!?!",
    "Pros: Nothing<br /><br />Cons: Everything<br /><br />Plot summary: A female reporter runs into a hitchhiker that tells her stories about the deaths of people that were killed by zombies.<br /><br />Review: Never in my life have I come across a movie as bad The Zombie Chronicles. Filmed on a budget of what looks to be about 20 bucks, TZC is a completely horrible horror movie that relies on lame, forgetable actors whom couldn't act to save their lives and gore that's more gross than frightening. How does a movie like this even get made? Simply put, avoid TZC like a sexually-transmitted disease.<br /><br />My last 2 cents: Humorously enough, this movie was made by a movie company called Brain Damage Films. They're brains must have really been damaged to come up with a craptacular movie like this.<br /><br />My rating: 1 out of 10(If it were up to me, this movie would get the rating of negative bajillion)",
    "If the crew behind \"Zombie Chronicles\" ever read this, here's some advice guys: <br /><br />1. In a \"Twist Ending\"-type movie, it's not a good idea to insert close-ups of EVERY DEATH IN THE MOVIE in the opening credits. That tends to spoil the twists, y'know...? <br /><br />2. I know you produced this on a shoestring and - to be fair - you worked miracles with your budget but please, hire people who can actually act. Or at least, walk, talk and gesture at the same time. Joe Haggerty, I'm looking at you...<br /><br />3. If you're going to set a part of your movie in the past, only do this if you have the props and costumes of the time.<br /><br />4. Twist endings are supposed to be a surprise. Sure, we don't want twists that make no sense, but signposting the \"reveal\" as soon as you introduce a character? That's not a great idea.<br /><br />Kudos to the guys for trying, but in all honesty, I'd rather they hadn't...<br /><br />Only for zombie completists.",
    "1st watched 8/3/2003 - 2 out of 10(Dir-Brad Sykes): Mindless 3-D movie about flesh-eating zombies in a 3 story within a movie chronicle. And yes, we get to see zombies eating human flesh parts in 3D!! Wow, not!! That has been done time and time again in 2D in a zombie movie but what usually makes a zombie movie better is the underlying story not the actual flesh-eating. That's what made the original zombie classics good. The flesh-eating was just thrown in as an extra. We're actually bored throughout most of this 3-part chronicle because of the lame(twilight-zone like) easily understood and slow-pacingly revealed finale's. The last story is actually the story the movie started with(having a reporter investigating a so-called ghost town) and of course we get to see flesh eating zombie's in that one as well. Well, I think I've said enough. Watch the classics, not this 3D bore-feast.",
    "There's tons of good-looking women in this flick. But alas, this movie is nudity-free. Grrrrrrrrrr Strike one.<br /><br />Ahem. One story in this film takes place in 1971. Then why the hell are the main characters driving a Kia Sportage? Hello? Continuity, anyone?<br /><br />As you might know, this movie was released in stereoscopic 3D. And it is the most hideous effect I have ever seen. I'm not sure if someone botched the job on this, but there WAS no 3D, just double-vision blurs. I didn't have the same problem with this company's other 3D movies, HUNTING SEASON and CAMP BLOOD. Sure, the 3D in those ones sucked too, but with them I could see a semblance of 3D effect.<br /><br />This thing is a big ball of nothing.<br /><br />And whoever that women was who played the daughter of the ear-eating dame, yum! I'd like to see more of her. In movies, as well. Looks like Janet Margolin at a young age. Purrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr<br /><br />",
    "En route to a small town that lays way off the beaten track (but which looks suspiciously close to a freeway), a female reporter runs into a strange hitch-hiker who agrees to help direct her to her destination. The strange man then recounts a pair of gruesome tales connected to the area: in the first story, an adulterous couple plot to kill the woman's husband, but eventually suffer a far worse fate themselves when they are attacked by a zombie; and in the second story, a group of campers have their vacation cut short when an undead outlaw takes umbrage at having his grave peed on.<br /><br />The Zombie Chronicles is an attempt by writer Garrett Clancy and director Brad Sykes at making a zombie themed anthologya nice idea, but with only two stories, it falls woefully short. And that's not the only way in which this low budget gore flick fails to deliver: the acting is lousy (with Joe Haggerty, as the tale-telling Ebenezer Jackson, giving one of the strangest performances I have ever seen); the locations are uninspired; the script is dreary; there's a sex scene with zero nudity; and the ending.... well, that beggars belief.<br /><br />To be fair, some of Sykes' creative camera-work is effective (although the gimmicky technique employed as characters run through the woods is a tad overused) and Joe Castro's cheapo gore is enthusiastic: an ear is bitten off, eyeballs are plucked out, a face is removed, brains are squished, and there is a messy decapitation. These positives just about make the film bearable, but be warned, The Zombie Chronicles ain't a stroll in the park, even for seasoned viewers of z-grade trash.<br /><br />I give The Zombie Chronicles 2/10, but generously raise my rating to 3 since I didn't get to view the film with the benefit of 3D (although I have a sneaking suspicion that an extra dimension wouldn't have made that much of a difference).",
    "Without wishing to be a killjoy, Brad Sykes is responsible for at least two of the most dull and clichéd films i've ever seen - this being one of them, and Camp Blood being another. <br /><br />The acting is terrible, the print is shoddy, and everything about this film screams \"seriously, you could do better yourself\". Maybe this is a challenge to everyone to saturate youtube with our own zombie related crap?<br /><br />I bought this for £1, but remember, you can't put a price on 71 minutes of your life. You'd do well to avoid this turkey, even at a bargain basement price.",
    "My girlfriend once brought around The Zombie Chronicles for us to watch as a joke. Little did we realize the joke was on her for paying £1 for it. While watching this film I started to come up with things I would rather be doing than watching The Zombie Chronicles. These included:<br /><br />1) Drinking bleach 2) Rubbing sand in my eyes 3) Writing a letter to Brad Sykes and Garrett Clancy 4) Re-enacting the American civil war 5) Tax returns 6) GCSE Maths 7) Sex with an old lady.<br /><br />Garrett Clancy, aka Sgt. Ben Draper wrote this? The guy couldn't even dig a hole properly. The best ting he did was kick a door down (the best part of the film). This was the worst film I have ever seen, and I've seen White Noise: The Light. Never has a film had so many mistakes in it. My girlfriend left it here, so now I live with the shame of owning this piece of crap.<br /><br />News just in: Owen Wilson watched this film and tried to kill himself. Fact.<br /><br />DO NOT WATCH",
    "Amateur, no budget films can be surprisingly good ... this however is not one of them.<br /><br />Ah, another Brad Sykes atrocity. The acting is hideous, except for Emmy Smith who shows some promise. The camera \"direction\" needs serious reworking. And no more \"hold the camera and run\" gimmicks either; it just doesn't work. The special effects are unimaginative, there's a problem when the effect can be identified in real time. If you're going to rip off an ear, please don't let us see the actor's real ear beneath the blood. The scenery is bland and boring (same as Mr. Sykes other ventures), and the music is a cross between cheap motel porn and really bad guitar driven metal (see the scenery comment).<br /><br />Did I mention the lack of any real plot, or character development? Apparently, the scriptwriter didn't.<br /><br />Whoever is funding this guy ... please stop. I've seen some of his other \"home movies\" (which I will not plug) and they are just as bad. Normally, a \"director\" will grow and learn from his previous efforts ... not this guy. It's one thing to be an amateur filmmaker, but anyone can be a hack.<br /><br />Definitely not even a popcorn film ... of course, chewing on popcorn kernels would be less painful than this effort.<br /><br />Award: The worst ever military push-ups in a film.",

    "Some films that you pick up for a pound turn out to be rather good - 23rd Century films released dozens of obscure Italian and American movie that were great, but although Hardgore released some Fulci films amongst others, the bulk of their output is crap like The Zombie Chronicles.<br /><br />The only positive thing I can say about this film is that it's nowhere near as annoying as the Stink of Flesh. Other than that, its a very clumsy anthology film with the technical competence of a Lego house built by a whelk.<br /><br />It's been noted elsewhere, but you really do have to worry about a film that inserts previews of the action into its credit sequence, so by the time it gets to the zombie attacks, you've seen it all already.<br /><br />Bad movie fans will have a ball watching the 18,000 continuity mistakes and the diabolical acting of the cast (especially the hitchhiker, who was so bad he did make me laugh a bit), and kudos to Hardgore for getting in to the spirit of things by releasing a print so bad it felt like I was watching some beat up home video of a camping trip.<br /><br />Awful, awful stuff. We've all made stuff like this when we've gotten a hold of a camera, but common sense prevails and these films languish in our cupboards somewhere. Avoid.",

    "I have not seen many low budget films i must admit, but this is the worst movie ever probably, the main character the old man talked like, he had a lobotomy and lost the power to speak more than one word every 5 seconds, a 5 year old could act better. The story had the most awful plot, and well the army guy had put what he thought was army like and then just went over the top, i only watched it to laugh at how bad it was, and hoped it was leading onto the real movie. I cant believe it was under the 2 night rental thing at blockbusters, instead of a please take this for free and get it out of our sight. I think there was one semi decent actor other than the woman, i think the only thing OK with the budget was the make up, but they show every important scene of the film in the beginning music bit. Awful simply awful.",
    "..Oh wait, I can! This movie is not for the typical film snob, unless you want to brush up on your typical cinematic definitions, like \"continuity editing\" and \"geographic match\". I couldn't tell where I was in this movie. One second they're in the present, next minute their supposedly in the 70's driving a modern SUV and wearing what looked like to me as 80's style clothing. I think. I couldn't pay long enough attention to it since the acting was just horrible. I think it only got attention because it has a 3d which I did not watch. If you're a b-movie buff, and by b-movie I mean BAD movie, then this film is for you. It's home-movie and all non-sense style will keep you laughing for as long as you can stay awake. If your tastes are more for Goddard and Antonioni, though, just skip this one.",
    "You have to admire Brad Sykes even if you don't particularly want to, a man who churns out budget horror after budget horror to less than enthusiastic receptions. But keeps on doing it all the same. Even the half-hearted praise than surrounds his Camp Blood films is given grudgingly and I'm as guilty of this as anyone. Brad normally manages to throw something interesting into the mix, a neat idea, a kooky character, whatever, but without the funds to take it further than base level, he relies on the audience to cut him some slack and appreciate it for what it is and what it could be. Joe Haggerty gives a spirited and very funny performance as Ebenezer Jackson and its a credit to Sykes that he can sense that this oddball turn is going to work within the framework of the film. Coming to a multiplex near you, in a parallel universe, somewhere.",
    "THE ZOMBIE CHRONICLES <br /><br />Aspect ratio: 1.33:1 (Nu-View 3-D)<br /><br />Sound format: Mono<br /><br />Whilst searching for a (literal) ghost town in the middle of nowhere, a young reporter (Emmy Smith) picks up a grizzled hitchhiker (Joseph Haggerty) who tells her two stories involving flesh-eating zombies reputed to haunt the area.<br /><br />An ABSOLUTE waste of time, hobbled from the outset by Haggerty's painfully amateurish performance in a key role. Worse still, the two stories which make up the bulk of the running time are utterly routine, made worse by indifferent performances and lackluster direction by Brad Sykes, previously responsible for the likes of CAMP BLOOD (1999). This isn't a 'fun' movie in the sense that Ed Wood's movies are 'fun' (he, at least, believed in what he was doing and was sincere in his efforts, despite a lack of talent); Sykes' home-made movies are, in fact, aggravating, boring and almost completely devoid of any redeeming virtue, and most viewers will feel justifiably angry and cheated by such unimaginative, badly-conceived junk. The 3-D format is utterly wasted here.",
    "A woman asks for advice on the road to reach a mysterious town, and hears two ghoulish stories from the local weirdo, both zombie related. But perhaps fate has something nasty in store for her too...<br /><br />The Zombie Chronicles is absolutely one of the worst films I have ever seen. In fact I must confess, so bad was it I fast forwarded through most of the garbage. And there was a lot of that, believe me. It runs for just 69 minutes, and there is still tons of filler. You get some skinhead doing a lot of push ups, plenty of dull kissy-kissy scenes between goofy teens (that rhymed, tee hee) and some fine examples of why some people should never become actors.<br /><br />As for the title characters, they barely even have a footnote in the film. Why, you get more undead action in the intro than you do the preceding feature! Though, considering how pathetic the eyes bursting out of sockets and the eating of brains sequences are (amongst other 'delights'), maybe that's a blessing in disguise.<br /><br />And to top it all off, it looks likes it's been filmed on someone's mobile phone for broadcast on Youtube. Jerky camera-work, scratches on the print, flickering lights... I had to rub my eyes when I realised it was made in 2001, and not 1971. Even the clothes and fashioned look about three decades out of date!<br /><br />If you think I'm not qualified to do a review of Chronicles having not seen the whole film, then go ahead. YOU try sitting through it, I betcha you won't even make it to the first appearance of the blue-smartie coloured freaks before making your excuses and leaving. It is truly laughable that anyone chose to release it, and honestly you'll get far more fun resting your drink on the disc than actually torturing your DVD player with this gigglesome excuse for horror. In fact, don't for surprised if it packs it's bags and leaves in the morning, leaving you doomed to watch VHS tapes for the rest of your life. You have been warned... 0/10<br /><br />P.S What kind of 18-rated horror has the woman keep a massive sports bra on during the obligatory sex scene?! See, the movie can't even get that part right...",
    "Really, I can't believe that I spent $5 on this movie. I am a huge zombie fanatic and thought the movie couldn't be that bad. It had zombies in it right? Was I wrong! To be honest the movie had it's moments...I thought it was cool when the guy got his head ripped off but that was about it. Overall I think that it would be more enjoyable to slide down a razorblade slide on my bare nutsack into a vat of vinegar then watch this movie again. The movie could have been better if we could see some boob but I had to watch the trailers for the other movies produced by this company to see that. Buyer beware...unless you are into masochism.",
    "I rented this movie about 3 years ago, and it still stands out in my mind as the worst movie ever made. I don't think I ever finished it. It is worse than a home video made by a high school student. I remember them doing a flashback to 1970 something and in the flashback there was a man with a polo shirt, oakley sunglasses and a newer SUV, like a Toyota Rav-4 or something (I don't remember). I don't understand how they could have possibly said that to be in the 70s. He might have had a cell phone too, I cant remember, It was just horrible. I returned it to the video store and asked them why they even carry the movie and if I could get the hour of my life back. To this day it is the worst movie I have ever seen, and I have seen some pretty bad ones.",
    ":Spoilers:<br /><br />I was very disappointed in Love's Abiding Joy. I had been waiting a really long time to see it and I finally got the chance when it re-aired Thursday night on Hallmark. I love the first three \"Love\" movies but this one was nothing like I thought it was going to be. The whole movie was sad and depressing, there were way to many goofs, and the editing was very poor - to many scenes out of context. I also think the death of baby Kathy happened way to soon and Clarks appearance in the movie just didn't seem to fit. It seemed like none of the actors really wanted to be there - they were all lacking emotion. There seemed to be no interaction between Missie and Willie at all.<br /><br />I think the script writers should have went more by the book. It seems like every movie that's been made so far just slips further and further away from Janette Oke's writings. I mean in the movie they never mentioned a thing about the mine and the two boys or Clark getting hurt because of it. And I think Missie and Willies reactions to Kathy's death could have been shown and heard rather than just heard.<br /><br />Out of the four movies that have been made so far I'd have to say that Love's Abiding Joy is my least favorite. I hope with the next four movies that more of the book is followed and if Clarks character is in them I hope he's got a bigger part and I hope his part isn't so bland. I also hope there is more of Scottie and Cookie and maybe even Marty but who knows what the script writers will have in store next.",
    "I've seen all four of the movies in this series. Each one strays further and further from the books. This is the worst one yet. My problem is that it does not follow the book it is titled after in any way! The directors and producers should have named it any thing other than \"Love's Abiding Joy.\" The only thing about this movie that remotely resembles the book are the names of some of the characters (Willie, Missie, Henry, Clark, Scottie and Cookie). The names/ages/genders of the children are wrong. The entire story line is no where in the book.<br /><br />I find it a great disservice to Janette Oke, her books and her fans to produce a movie under her title that is not correct in any way. The music is too loud. The actors are not convincing - they lack emotions.<br /><br />If you want a good family movie, this might do. It is clean. Don't watch it, though, if you are hoping for a condensed version of the book. I hope that this will be the last movie from this series, but I doubt it. If there are more movies made, I wish Michael Landon, Jr and others would stick closer to the original plot and story lines. The books are excellent and, if closely followed, would make excellent movies!",
    "I very much looked forward to this movie. Its a good family movie; however, if Michael Landon Jr.'s editing team did a better job of editing, the movie would be much better. Too many scenes out of context. I do hope there is another movie from the series, they're all very good. But, if another one is made, I beg them to take better care at editing. This story was all over the place and didn't seem to have a center. Which is unfortunate because the other movies of the series were great. I enjoy the story of Willie and Missy; they're both great role models. Plus, the romantic side of the viewers always enjoy a good love story.",
    "I have read all of the Love Come Softly books. Knowing full well that movies can not use all aspects of the book,but generally they at least have the main point of the book. I was highly disappointed in this movie. The only thing that they have in this movie that is in the book is that Missy's father comes to visit,(although in the book both parents come). That is all. The story line was so twisted and far fetch and yes, sad, from the book, that I just couldn't enjoy it. Even if I didn't read the book it was too sad. I do know that Pioneer life was rough,but the whole movie was a downer. The rating is for having the same family orientation of the film that makes them great.",
    "As a Southern Baptist, it pains me that I must give a below average rating to an overtly Christian movie. There certainly aren't so many that I want to discourage film-makers from a genre that's woefully under-exploited. Still, I must honestly say that \"Love's Abiding Joy\" is a typically low budget, low key, self-consciously Christian film. The plot is predictable, the acting mediocre (I'm being kind), and the editing atrocious. As a TV movie it might have been slightly above average, but as a feature film it leaves much to be desired. Keep trying guys. You've got to have a movie about about real Christians inside you somewhere. Might I suggest you turn to G. K. Chesterton or C. S. Lewis for some inspiration?",
    "As a kid I did think the weapon the murderer wielded was cool, however I was a kid and so I was a bit dumb. Even as a dumb kid though the movies plot was stupid and a bit boring when the killer was not using his light knife to kill people. What amazes me is that the movie has a really solid cast in it. What script did they read when agreeing to be in this movie as it is most assuredly boring and only a means to show off a light saber on a very small scale. The plot at times is incomprehensible and the end is totally chaotic. The whole film seems to rotate around aliens and the one weapon. The plot has two kids and some dude having an alien encounter, flash years later and there seems to be a return as it were in the mix. Dead animals and such to be explored and for some reason the one dude gets the weapon of the aliens and proceeds to use it to go on a very light killing spree. Seriously, you just have to wonder why this movie was made, if you are going to have a killer have some good death scenes, if you are going to have alien encounters show more than a weird light vortex thing, and if you are going to have light sabers then call yourself star wars.",
    "Jill Dunne (played by Mitzi Kapture), is an attractive, nice woman, over-whelmed by a smart-mouthed teenage daughter, Liv (Martha MacIsaac) and a petty, two-timing husband, Sean (Rick Roberts), both of which were tediously self-centered, and obnoxious.<br /><br />This was advertised as a troubled family stalked by a crazed killer during a relentless storm.<br /><br />The storm doesn't even happen until about the last 5 minutes of the film, and then it isn't anything to send anybody running to the storm cellar.<br /><br />The stalking, likewise doesn't get intense until almost the end of the film.<br /><br />Most of the film we spend listening to Jill and her insufferable daughter, Liv, argue until I just wanted to back slap the daughter into next week.<br /><br />Jill's problem with Liv is that she has taken up with Zack, a boy of questionable character, and they are constantly making out--in fact Jill comes home to find the two of them on Liv's bed.<br /><br />The rest of the time we spend listening to Jill's husband Sean either whine at Jill or criticize her.<br /><br />Sean was not at all appealing--since his face is so covered in freckles you could play connect the dots.<br /><br />The story begins with Jill being notified of an out-standing bill on their credit card for a hotel she has never been to, and that she thought Sean had never been to either.<br /><br />Jill goes to the hotel where she meets the owner & manager, Richard Grant (Nick Mancuso), a very nice, older, divorced man, who is sympathetic to her. In fact, when he spots her husband there again, he phones Jill and tips her off.<br /><br />Jill returns to the hotel, sees Sean with another woman. She is upset, leaves without Sean seeing her, and does absolutely nothing. In fact, she doesn't even say anything to Sean when he arrives home.

In fact, he seems a bit more aggressive than necessary, when Jill suddenly decides to cut out.<br /><br />Jill and Sean have a confrontation about his cheating. Sean whines about how Jill has been letting him down since her father died. Apparently his lack of any morals is all her fault. Eventually Jill confesses her own lack of morals and near adultery to Sean--and of course that's all her fault too, as far as Sean is concerned.<br /><br />The little family decides to go on a camping trip--which means more whining and grousing among them, especially from the spoiled daughter.<br /><br />I was so rooting for the stalker to get everybody, but Jill.<br /><br />3 stars",
    "This movie sucked. It really was a waste of my life. The acting was atrocious, the plot completely implausible. Long, long story short, these people get \"terrorized\" by this pathetic \"crazed killer\", but completely fail to fight back in any manner. And this is after they take a raft on a camping trip, with no gear, and show up at a campsite that is already assembled and completely stocked with food and clothes and the daughters headphones. Additionally, after their boat goes missing, they panic that they're stuck in the woods, but then the daughters boyfriend just shows up and they apparently never consider that they could just hike out of the woods like he did to get to them. Like I said, this movie sucks. A complete joke. Don't let your girlfriend talk you into watching it.",
    "Lifetime did it again. Can we say stupid? I couldn't wait for it to end. The plot was senseless. The acting was terrible! Especially by the teenagers. The story has been played a thousand times! Are we just desperate to give actors a job? The previews were attractive and I was really looking for a good thriller.Once in awhile lifetime comes up with a good movie, this isn't one of them. Unless one has nothing else to do I would avoid this one at all cost. This was a waste of two hours of my life. Can I get them back? I would have rather scraped my face against a brick wall for two hours then soaked it in peroxide. That would have been more entertaining.",
    "I have to say I am really surprised at the high ratings for this movie. I found it to be absolutely idiotic. The mother gets \"visions\" when she touches certain things or people? And one thing she touched twice made her vision continue... Just seemed so ridiculous. Deedee Pfieffer's performance was awful I thought. She was very irritating. The girl who played Lori did a good job and so did most of the supporting cast for what they had to work with.<br /><br />I usually love LMN and am very open minded when it comes to movies but this movie seemed to have a ridiculous plot and over the top acting and it just was not for me.",
    "The original book of this was set in the 1950s but that won't do for the TV series because most people watch for the 1930s style. Ironically the tube train near the end was a 1950s train painted to look like a 1930s train so the Underground can play at that game too. Hanging the storyline on a plot about the Jarrow March was feeble but the 50s version had students who were beginning to think about the world around them so I suppose making them think about the poverty of the marchers is much the same thing. All the stuff about Japp having to cater for himself was weak too but they had to put something in to fill the time. This would have made a decent half hour show or they could have filmed the book and made it a better long show. It is obvious this episode is a victim of style over content.",
    "The annoying mouse and lullaby really got to me and really had nothing to do with the story...It's something I would have done my 1st year in film school. Very sad. Additionally, the story just seemed to drag on for no apparent reason...there were too many things just thrown in there that had nothing to do with the story, which makes me feel that the creative team didn't really know what they were doing, or just that it should have been shorter...which would have been a blessing, not a crime. As I have just watched all of the episodes up to this point over the past week...I'd have to say that this was by far the worst, and I just wanted to warn others not to start with this one.",
    "I saw this film opening weekend in Australia, anticipating with an excellent cast of Ledger, Edgerton, Bloom, Watts and Rush that the definitive story of Ned Kelly would unfold before me. Unfortunately, despite an outstanding performance by Heath Ledger in the lead role, the plot was paper thin....which doesn't inspire me to read \"Our Sunshine\". There were some other plus points, the support acting from Edgerton in particular, assured direction from Jordan (confirming his talent on show in Buffalo Soldiers as well), and production design that gave a real feel of harshness to the Australian bush, much as the Irish immigrants of the early 19th century must have seen it. But I can't help feeling that another opportunity has been missed to tell the real story of an Australian folk hero (or was he?)....in what I suspect is a concession to Hollywood and selling the picture in the US. Oh well, at least Jordan and the producers didn't agree to lose the beards just to please Universal...<br /><br />Guess I will just have to content myself with Peter Carey's excellent \"Secret History of the Kelly Gang\". 4/10",
    "I saw this at the premiere in Melbourne<br /><br />It is shallow, two-dimensional, unaffecting and, hard to believe given the subject matter, boring. The actors are passable, but they didn't have much to work with given the very plodding and unimpressive script. For those who might have worried that Ned Kelly would be over-intellectualised, you can take comfort in the fact that this telling of the story is utterly without any literary depth at all, told entirely on the surface and full of central casting standards. However, it doesn't work as a popcorn film either. Its pacing is too off-kilter and its craft is too lacking to satisfy even on the level of a mundane actioner.<br /><br />I very much doubt Gregor Jordan could sit back and say to himself \"this is the best I could have done with the material\".<br /><br />Ned Kelly is a fascinating figure, and equally so is the national response to him. Possibly folk genius, possibly class warrior, possibly psychopath and probably all these things, he has dominated Australian true mythology for over 120 years. Once again, his story has failed miserably on the big screen.<br /><br />Such is life.",
    "Ned Kelly (Ledger), the infamous Australian outlaw and legend. Sort of like Robin Hood, with a mix of Billy the Kid, Australians love the legend of how he stood up against the English aristocratic oppression, and united the lower classes to change Australia forever. The fact that the lower classes of the time were around 70% immigrant criminals seems to be casually skimmed around by this film. Indeed, quite a few so called `facts' in this film are, on reflection, a tad dubious.<br /><br />I suppose the suspicions should have been aroused when, in the opening credits, it was claimed that this film is based upon the book, `Our Sunshine'. If ever a romanticized version of truth could be seen in a name for a book, there it was. This wasn't going to be a historical epic, but just an adaptation of one of many dubious legends of Ned Kelly, albeit a harsh and sporadically brutal version.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Ned Kelly is nothing more than an overblown Hallmark channel `real life historical drama' wannabe! The story plods along at an alarming rate (alarming because never has a film plodded so slowly!) The feeling of numbness after the two hours of pure drivel brought back memories of Costner's awful Wyatt Earp all those years ago. Simply put, nothing happens in the film, but it takes a long time getting to that nothing. This would possibly have been a tad more bearable if the performances were good (because the direction sure as heck wasn't). However, unless you are looking to play a game of spot the worst Oirish accent, then you're gonna be disappointed. Between that, the game of `Who has the stupidest beard?', `Spot the obvious backstabber!' (clue, they are all ginger for some reason), and `Nature in Australia.including lions', it is an experience similar to flicking through Hallmark, The History Channel, Discovery Channel, and Neighbours whilst suffering a huge hangover. Yup, nature pops up a lot, as to fill even more time (possibly an attempt to look arty), the film keeps showing pointless wildlife shots, and once all the native species are shown, here's a circus to allow for a camel and a lion (which is used during one fight to try to make us actually feel more sorry for the lion than the massacred people).<br /><br />This is a turgid, emotionless piece of historical fluff which should have gone straight to TV. There isn't even one good word I can say about this film. Even the usually fantastic Rush seems embarrassed to be here. When one of the characters comments that there is only 2 bullets left for him and his pal, I myself was wishing I had a gun to blow any memory of this film out of my head!",
    "They constructed this one as a kind of fantasy Man From Snowy River meets Butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid, and just for a romantic touch Ned and Joe get to play away with high class talent, the bored young wives of wealthy older men. OK, there are lots of myths about Ned Kelly, but there are also a lot of well documented facts, still leaving space for artistic creativity in producing a good historical dramaticisation. I mean, this is not the Robin Hood story, not the Arthurian legends, not Beowulf, not someone whose life is so shrouded in the mists of many many centuries past that any recreation of their life and times is 99% guesswork. It's only a couple of lifetimes ago. My own grandparents were already of school age when Ned was hanged. <br /><br />So it's silly me for fancifully imagining this movie was a serious attempt to tell the Kelly story. Having recently read Peter Carey's excellent novel \"The True History of the Kelly Gang\" I had eagerly anticipated that this would be in similar vein. But no, the fact is that Mick Jagger's much derided 1970 Kelly was probably far closer to reality, and a better movie overall, which isn't saying a whole lot for it.<br /><br />Glad it only cost me two bucks to hire the DVD! I'll give it 3/10, and that's only because some of the nice shots of the Australian bush make me feel generous.",
    "This has to be the worst piece of garbage I've seen in a while.<br /><br />Heath Ledger is a heartthrob? He looked deformed. I wish I'd known that he and Naomi Watts are an item in real life because I spent 2 of the longest hours of my life wondering what she saw in him. <br /><br />Orlando Bloom is a heartthrob? With the scraggly beard and deer-in-the-headlights look about him, I can't say I agree.<br /><br />Rachel Griffiths was her usual fabulous self, but Geoffrey Rush looked as if he couldn't wait to get off the set. <br /><br />I'm supposed to feel sorry for bankrobbers and murderers? This is a far cry from Butch Cassidy, which actually WAS an entertaining film. This was trite, cliche-ridden and boring. We only stayed because we were convinced it would get better. It didn't.<br /><br />The last 10-15 minutes or so were unintentionally hilarious. Heath and his gang are holed up in a frontier hotel, and women and children are dying because of their presence. That's not funny. But it was funny when they walked out of the hotel with the armor on, because all we could think of was the Black Knight from Monty Python and the Holy Grail. I kept waiting for them to say \"I'll bite yer leg off!\" We were howling with laughter, as were several other warped members of the audience. When we left, pretty much everyone was talking about what a waste of time this film was.<br /><br />I may not have paid cash to see this disaster (sneak preview), but it certainly wasn't free. It cost me 2 hours of my life that I will never get back.",
    "If the term itself were not geographically and semantically meaningless, one might well refer to \"Ned Kelly\" as an \"Australian Western.\" For the people Down Under, Ned Kelly was, apparently, a folk hero bandit akin to Robin Hood, Jesse James, Bonnie and Clyde, and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. The descendant of Irish immigrants, Kelly became a fugitive and an outlaw after he was falsely accused of shooting an Australian law officer, a crime for which his equally innocent mother was put into prison. To get back at the government for this mistreatment, Kelly, his brother Dan, and two other companions, became notorious bank robbers, winning over the hearts of many people in the countryside while striking a blow for justice in a land where Irish immigrants were often treated with disrespect and disdain by those who ran the country.<br /><br />Perhaps because we've encountered this \"gentleman bandit\" scenario so many times in the past, \"Ned Kelly\" feels awfully familiar and unoriginal as it pays homage to any number of the genre's stereotypes and clichés on its way to the inevitable showdown. Ned is the typical heart-of-gold lawbreaker who kills only when he is forced to and, even then, only with the deepest regret. He also has the pulse of the common folk, as when, in the middle of a bank robbery, he returns a valuable watch to one of the customers, after one of his gang has so inconsiderately pilfered it. What movie on this particular subject hasn't featured a scene like that? It's acts of selective generosity like this, of course, that earn him the love and respect of all the little people who come to secretly admire anyone who can get away with sticking it to the powers-that-be and the status quo. Geoffrey Rush plays the typical bedeviled law enforcer who feels a personal stake in bringing down this upstart troublemaker who keeps getting away with tweaking the establishment. There's even the inevitable episode in which one of the ladies being held up goes into the next room and has sex with one of the robbers, so turned on is she by the romantic derring-do of the criminal lifestyle. And the film is riddled with one hackneyed scene like this after another.<br /><br />Heath Ledger fails to distinguish himself in the title role, providing little in the way of substance to make his character either interesting or engaging. It doesn't help that he has been forced to provide a droning voice-over narration that underlines the sanctimoniousness and pretentiousness of both the character and the film.<br /><br />\"Ned Kelly\" might serve a function of sorts as a lesson in Australian history, but as an entertainment, it's just the same old story told with different accents.",
    "This movie was so unrelentingly bad, I could hardly believe I was watching it. The directing, editing, production, and script all seemed as though they had been done by junior high school students who don't know all that much about movies. There was no narrative flow that made any sort of sense. Big emotional moments and climaxes (like one early on between Heath Ledger and Naomi Watts) and character relationships (like one hinted at at the very beginning) come completely out of no where and are not set up like they would have been in a more elegantly and effectively made film. The characters are sadly underdeveloped, making it difficult for us to have any sort of connection with them. The acting, surprisingly, is not entirely bad, but the terrible writing cancels out the relatively convincing performances. The film plays like a particularly bad T.V. western/epic, and sadly diminishes the fascinating (true) story that it attempts to tell. I have read a lot of reviews that defend the film as being important to Australians because of the subject matter. That's all very well, but just because Ned Kelly is an important Australian historical icon DOESN'T MAKE THE MOVIE GOOD. No one is saying that the subject matter isn't good, just the quality of the movie itself. Pearl Harbor was about a very important historical event to Americans, but that doesn't mean I'm going to defend the movie and say it was good, because it was still bad. A failure all around, though Heath and Orlando are lovely to look at.",
    "This movie never made it to theaters in our area, so when it became available on DVD I was one of the first to rent it. For once, I should listened to the critics and passed on this one.<br /><br />Despite the excellent line up of actors the movie was very disappointing. I can see now why it went straight to video. <br /><br />I had thought that with Bloom, Ledger, and Rush it could have some value. All have done wonderful work in the past. <br /><br />The movie was slow moving and never pulled me in. I failed to develop much empathy for the characters and had to fight the urge to fast-forward just to get to the end. <br /><br />I do not recommend this film even if you are thinking of renting it for only for 'eye candy' purposes. It won't satisfy even that.",
    "I thought this was a very clunky, uninvolving version of a famous Australian story. Heath Ledger and Orlando Bloom were very good in their roles, and gave their characters some personality; but the whole thing felt forced and mechanical.<br /><br />The beginning could have been a lot more involving; perhaps starting with a shootout, and then flashing back for a recap of how they got there or that sort of thing. And I felt like every scene was routinely predictable and signposted, like a very bad tv soap.<br /><br />I was really looking forward to this movie, and hoping for something a lot better. The only thing I can say in its favour is that it beats the Mick Jagger version, but not by much.",
    "Ned aKelly is such an important story to Australians but this movie is awful. It's an Australian story yet it seems like it was set in America. Also Ned was an Australian yet he has an Irish accent...it is the worst film I have seen in a long time",
    "From the very beginning, the political theme of this film is so obvious and heavy handed, that the outcome is entirely predictable. Any good textbook on writing screenplays will advise layering of characters, incorporating character arcs, and three act structure. In this film you will find none of that. The police are the baddies, and consequently are shown as shallow, incompetent and cowards. It never seems to occur to the makers of this film that police might be honourable citizens who see joining the police as a good way to contribute to the wellbeing of society.<br /><br />The viewer gets no opportunity to make up his or her mind on whether Ned Kelly is a good guy or a ruthless villain. The film opens with him being arrested for stealing a horse, but we get no clue as to his guilt or innocence. We see him walk through the door of a gaol, but only know that he has been inside for three years when we hear this much later in some dialogue.<br /><br />This film contains many shots of Ned looking at the camera with a serious expression. I found the film a real chore to watch. It is the direction for modern films, and this one put me off watching any more.",
    "I guess I was attracted to this film both because of the sound of the story and the leading actor, so I gave it a chance, from director Gregor Jordan (Buffalo Soldiers). Basically Ned Kelly (Heath Ledger) is set up by the police, especially Superintendent Francis Hare (Geoffrey Rush), he is forced to go on the run forming a gang and go against them to clear his own and his family's names. That's really all I can say about the story, as I wasn't paying the fullest attention to be honest. Also starring Orlando Bloom as Joseph Byrne, Naomi Watts as Julia Cook, Laurence Kinlan as Dan Kelly, Philip Barantini as Steve Hart, Joel Edgerton as Aaron Sherritt, Kiri Paramore as Constable Fitzpatrick, Kerry Condon as Kate Kelly, Emily Browning as Grace Kelly and Rachel Griffiths as Susan Scott. Ledger makes a pretty good performance, for what it's worth, and the film does have it's eye-catching moments, particularly with a gun battle towards the end, but I can't say I enjoyed it as I didn't look at it all. Okay!",
    "I don't quite get the rating for The Amati Girls and I think I was REALLY kind giving it a 4 out of 10. What could otherwise have been a wonderful story with actually a set of more or less decent actors became a total farce in my eyes. There are so many clichés in that flick, the women's hair is just awful and most of the scenes are more than unrealistic or seem fake. There's no real passion in this movie but a bunch of actors over-acting over any limits that it hurts. It's not funny enough to be a comedy, it's too fake-sad to really touch, so in my eyes it's just not good. Watching it I couldn't believe how something like that made it to my TV set in my living room in Switzerland. But.. maybe it still was OK and it just got lost in translation? Who knows. Definitely one of the oddest movies I've ever seen and this certainly not in a good way! Sorry.",
    "This movie was awful. The ending was absolutely horrible. There was no plot to the movie whatsoever. The only thing that was decent about the movie was the acting done by Robert DuVall and James Earl Jones. Their performances were excellent! The only problem was that the movie did not do their acting performances any justice. If the script would have come close to capturing a halfway decent story, it would be worth watching. Instead, Robert DuVall's and James Earl Jones' performances are completely wasted on a god awful storyline...or lack thereof. Not only was I left waiting throughout the movie for something to happen to make the movie....well an actual movie...not just utterless dialog between characters for what ended up being absolutely no reason. It was nothing more than common dialog that would have taken place back in that period of time. There was nothing special about any of the characters. The only thing special was how Robert DuVall portrayed a rambling, senile, drunk, old man. Nothing worthy happens during the entire movie including the end. When the movie ended, I sat amazed...amazed that I sat through the entire movie waiting for something of interest to happen to make watching the movie worth while. It never happened! The cast of characters suddenly started rolling making it apparent that the movie really was over and I realized that I had just wasted 2 hours of my life watching a movie with absolutely no plot and no meaning. It wasn't even a story. The entire movie takes place in a day's worth of time. That's it. It was one day in the life (and death) of some Southerners on a plantation. How much of a story can take place in a single day (other than the movie Training Day)? The acting performances by the entire cast were excellent, but they were grossly wasted on such a disappointment of a movie...if you can even call it a movie.",
    "Holy crap. This was the worst film I have seen in a long time. All the performances are fine, but there is no plot. Really! No plot! A bunch of clowns talk about this and that and that's your film. Ug... Robert Duvall's character is senile and keeps asking the same people the same qestions over and over. This earns him the same responses over and over. I am pretty sure this film got upto a six because people think they should like it. Good performances with famous and well regarded actors, but the actual complete work is a steamy turd. Well, maybe that's a bit deceptive since steam rising from a fresh pile sounds a little like something happening and in this film NOTHING HAPPENS! Sack",
    "SWING! is an important film because it's one of the remaining Black-produced and acted films from the 1930s. Many of these films have simply deteriorated so badly that they are unwatchable, but this one is in fairly good shape. It's also a nice chance to see many of the talented Black performers of the period just after the heyday of the old Cotton Club--a time all but forgotten today.<br /><br />Unfortunately, while the film is historically important and has some lovely performances, it's also a mess. The main plot is very similar to the Hollywood musicals of the era--including a prima donna who is going to ruin the show and the surprise unknown who appears from no where to save the day. However, the writing is just god-awful and a bit trashy at times--and projects images of Black America that some might find a bit demeaning. This is because before the plot really gets going, you are treated to a no-account bum who lives off his hard working wife (a popular stereotype of the time) and when he is caught with a hussy (who, by the way, totally overplays this role), they have a fight which looks like a scene from WWE Smackdown! And, the one lady wants to cut the other lady with a straight razor--a trashy scene indeed! Later in the film, when the prima donna is behaving abominably, her husband punches her in the face and everyone applauds him! It seems like the film, at times, wants to appeal to the lowest common denominator in the audience PLUS they can't even do this well--with some of the worst acting I've seen in a very long time.<br /><br />Still, if you can look past a lousy production in just about every way (with trashy characters, bad acting and direction and poor writing), this one might be worth a peek so you can see excellent singing and tap dancing--as well as to catch a glimpse of forgotten Black culture. Just don't say I didn't warn you about the acting--it's really, really bad!",
    "There's not a drop of sunshine in \"The Sunshine Boys\", which makes the title of this alleged comedy Neil Simon's sole ironic moment. Simon, who adapted the script from his play (which goes uncredited), equates old age with irrational behavior--and, worse, clumsy, galumphing, mean-spirited irrational behavior. Walter Matthau is merciless on us playing an aged vaudeville performer talked into reuniting with former comedy partner George Burns for a television special (it's said they were a team for 43 years, which begs the question \"how long did vaudeville last, anyway?\"). Burns, who won a Supporting Oscar, has the misfortune of coming to the film some thirty minutes in, after which time Matthau has already blasted the material to hell and back. The noisier the movie gets, the less tolerable and watchable it is. Director Herbert Ross only did solid work when he wasn't coupled with one of Neil Simon's screenplays; here, Ross sets up gags like a thudding amateur, hammering away at belligerent routines which fail to pay off (such as semi-incoherent Matthau showing up at a mechanic's garage to audition for a TV commercial). At this point, Matthau was still too young for this role, and he over-compensates by slouching and hollering. It was up to Ross and Simon to tone down the character, to nuance his temperament to give \"The Sunshine Boys\" some sunniness, yet Walter continues to project as if we'd all gone deaf. The picture looks terribly drab and crawls along at a spiritless pace; one loses hope for it early on. *1/2 from ****",
    "I like Goldie Hawn and wanted another one of her films, so when I saw Protocol for $5.50 at Walmart I purchased it. Although mildly amusing, the film never really hits it a stride. Some scenes such as a party scene in a bar just goes on for too long and really has no purpose.<br /><br />Then, of course, there is the preachy scene at the end of the film which gives the whole film a bad taste as far as I'm concerned. I don't think this scene added to the movie at all. I don't like stupid comedies trying to teach me a lesson, written by some '60's burn out especially!<br /><br />In the end, although I'm glad to possess another Hawn movie, I'm not sure it was really worth the money I paid for it!",
    "Protocol is an implausible movie whose only saving grace is that it stars Goldie Hawn along with a good cast of supporting actors. The story revolves around a ditzy cocktail waitress who becomes famous after inadvertently saving the life of an Arab dignitary. The story goes downhill halfway through the movie and Goldie's charm just doesn't save this movie. Unless you are a Goldie Hawn fan don't go out of your way to see this film.",
    "What does the \" Executive producer \" do in a movie . If I remember correctly it's the person who raised the financial backing to make the movie . You might notice in a great number of movies starring Sean Connery that he is also the executive producer which meant Connery himself raised the money since he is a major player . Unfortunately it should also be pointed out that a great number of movies \" starring Sean Connery were solely made because he managed to raise the money since he's a major Hollywood player , it's usually an indication that when the credits read that the executive producer and the star of the movie are one and the same the movie itself is nothing more than a star vehicle with the story/screenplay not being up to scratch <br /><br />PROTOCOL follows the saga of one Sunny Davis a kooky bimboesque cocktail waitress who saves a visiting dignitary and as a reward gets made a top diplomat . Likely ? As things progress Ms Davis ( Who has problems being able to string two sentences together ) finds herself in more outlandish and less likely situations . When I say that PROTOCOL stars Goldie Hawn who is also the film's executive producer do you understand what I'm saying about the story/screenplay not being up to scratch ? Exactly",
    "Outlandish premise that rates low on plausibility and unfortunately also struggles feebly to raise laughs or interest. Only Hawn's well-known charm allows it to skate by on very thin ice. Goldie's gotta be a contender for an actress who's done so much in her career with very little quality material at her disposal...<br /><br />",
    "There are only two movies I would give a 1/10 to, this stinker and \"The Man who Fell to Earth.\" I remember seeing Protocol at a theater in the early 80s when I was in high school. The script is insulting to anyone (including a high school student's) intelligence. It completely lost me with the \"hillarious\" gag of someone getting shot in the butt. Goldie Hawn is supposed to be charming but comes across as vapid and moronic. Then there are offensive stereotypes about Arabs, followed by Goldie winning over everyone by spouting populist dribble. The acting was terrible, including Goldie Hawn's. I could not stand to see another movie she was in until IMO she redeemed herself in Everyone Says I Love You. This is the kind of movie you make if you want to put no effort into screenplay writing. The worst.",
    "The only good thing about this movie was the shot of Goldie Hawn standing in her little french cut bikini panties and struggling to keep a dozen other depraved women from removing her skimpy little cotton top while she giggled and cooed. Ooooof! Her loins rival those of Nina Hartley. This movie came out when I was fourteen and that shot nearly killed me. I'd forgotten about it all tucked away in the naughty Roladex of my mind until seeing it the other day on TV, where they actually blurred her midsection in that scene, good grief, reminding me what a smokin' hottie of a woman Goldie Hawn was in the '80s. Kurt Russell must have had a fun life.",
    "I'm studying Catalan, and was delighted to find El Mar, a movie with mostly Catalan dialogue, at my art-house video store.<br /><br />Hmmm... not so delighted to have seen it.<br /><br />Yes, as other reviewers have said, it's well-made, and beautifully photographed. Although the opening sequence of the children is shockingly violent, it's well-acted and convincing. (For the most part, that is... Would the Mallorquins strip a corpse in preparation for burial right in the middle of the town square, in full view of the dead man's 10-year-old boy?) Oh, well... minor detail. Up to this point, it had something of the feel of a non-magical Pan's Labyrinth, also set in the Spanish Civil War.<br /><br />Fast-forward, and the three children who survived the opening incident have come of age. Francisca is a nun working at a tuberculosis sanatorium and the two boys, Manuel and Ramallo, both are patients. I know, but hey, coincidences happen.<br /><br />The problem, as with so many Spanish movies (apologies to Almodovar fans), is that with one exception (Francisca) the characters are just so dang *weird*. Their motivations, personalities, and dialogue are often simply incoherent.<br /><br />What's more, it descends into some horrific wretched excess. Be prepared for LOTS of pain and LOTS of blood. The reviewer who called it a \"potboiler\" is quite on track. If it had been made 40 years ago, the poster would've said: SEE FORBIDDEN LOVE!! RAPE!! MURDER!! MUTILATION!! FANATICISM!! ANIMAL CRUELTY!! BETRAYAL!! <br /><br />The opening sequence is not nearly enough to make the personalities and relationships of the characters believable. To work, this should have had multiple flashbacks to flesh out the characters. As it is, it seems a bizarre and depressing cross between \"Brother Sun, Sister Moon\" and \"Pulp Fiction.\" If that sounds like something you've got to see, by all means, enjoy. I think I go with something that doesn't make me feel I need to take a shower to wash off the gore and gloom.<br /><br />As for the Catalan, it's the Mallorqui dialect, fairly different than the Barcelona dialect, though I was surprised by the comment that said that even Barcelonans apparently needed Catalan subtitles to understand it.",
    "I was excited to view a Cataluña´s film in the Berlin´s competition. But after the presentation I was total disappointed and furious. Too much blood, too much time, too much themes for nothing. The Spanish Civil War, like every war, was horrible. The revenge, a very human behavior, not pretty at all, is shown in uncountable films and plays, as well as the relations between homosexuals and the scepticism in Spain about Catholicism . But what Mr Villaronga try, is a pseudo tragedy that can belongs to the worst of the film´s history. It is really a pity to see Angela Molina in this movie. I advise nobody under no circumstances to go to see this film.",
    "this film was a major letdown. the level of relentless cruelty and violence in this film was very disturbing. some scenes were truly unnecessarily ugly and mean-spirited. the main characters were impossible to identify with or even sympathize with. the lead protagonist's character was as slimy as they come. the sickroom/hothouse atmosphere lent itself to over-the-top theatrics. little or nothing could be learned about the Spanish civil war from this film. fortunately, i've been to spain and realize this is not realistic! in addition, the use of same-sex attraction as a lurid \"horror\" was also very offensive and poorly handled, while the DVD is being packaged and advertised to attract gay viewers. the actors seemed uncomfortable in their roles,as if they were trying to distance themselves from this mess.i guess if you like watching children and pets being brutally killed,this film might especially appeal to you.",
    "Three part \"horror\" film with some guy in a boarded up house imploring the viewer not to go \"out there\" and (unfortunately) gives us three tales to prove why.<br /><br />The first story involves a young couple in a car accident who meet up with two psychos. It leads up to two totally predictable twists. Still, it's quick (about 15 minutes), violent, well-acted and well-done. Predictable but enjoyable.<br /><br />The second involves a man on the run after stealing a large amount of money. His car breaks down, he's attacked by a dog and stumbles into a nearby clinic. VERY obvious, badly done and extremely slow. Even at 30 minutes this is too long. Good acting though.<br /><br />The third is just barely a horror story. It involves a beautiful, lonely woman looking for Mr. Right. It has beautiful set designs, a nice erotic feel and a nice sex scene. But (again) predictable and not even remotely scary.<br /><br />It ends very stupidly.<br /><br />All in all, the first one is worth watching, but that's it. Tune in for that one then turn it off.",
    "A very cheesy and dull road movie, with the intention to be hip and modern, shown in the editing style and some weird camera angles, resulting only in sleepiness. <br /><br />The cast is wasted, the writing is stupid and pretentious. The only thing worthwhile is the top-notch Lalo Schifrin's soundtrack, really cool and also the opening sequence, very original and interesting. <br /><br />Run if you can, the bad opinions and comments about this flick are totally deserved; it is really pure garbage. Of course that this has its charm, of watching a movie which everybody would not drop the beer glass on if it were on fire, but save it for a stormy day where you have absolutely nothing else to do.",
    "There are some nice shots in this film, it catches some of the landscapes with such a beautiful light, in fact the cinematography is probably it's best asset.<br /><br />But it's basically more of a made for TV movie, and although it has a lot of twists and turns in the plot, which keeps it quite interesting viewing, there are no subtitles and key plot developments are unveiled in Spanish, so non Spanish speakers will be left a little lost.<br /><br />I had it as a Xmas gift, as it's a family trait to work through the films of a actor we find talented, and Matthew Mconaughey was just awesome in \"A Time to kill\" , and the \"The Newton Boys \" so I expressed I wanted to see more of his work.<br /><br />However although it says on the DVD box it is a Matthew Mconaughey film and uses this as a marketing ploy, he has a few lines and is on screen for not very minutes at the end of the film, he is basically an extra and he doesn't exactly light up the screen while he is on, so die hard fans, really not worth it from that point of view.<br /><br />The films star though, Patrick McGaw is great though and very easy on the eye, and his character is just so nice and kind and caring, a true saint of a guy, he'd be well written into a ROM com.<br /><br />So for true Mcconaughey acting brilliance of the ones I've seen, I'd recommend, \"A Time to kill\" , \"The Newton Boys \" \"Frailty\", \"How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days\", \"Edtv\" and \"Amistad\" and avoid too \"Larger Than Life\" and \"Angels in the Outfield\" unless you feel like a kids film or have kids around as neither of these are indicative of his talent, but are quite amusing films for children, again MM is really nothing more that a supporting artist with just a few if any lines.<br /><br />As for Scorpion Springit's not a bad film but it also isn't screen stealing either.",
    "I have been looking for this film for ages because it is quite rare to find as it was one of the video nasties. I finally found it on DVD at the end of last year it is a very low budget movie The story is set around amazon jungle tribes that are living in fear of the devil. Laura Crawford is a model who is kidnapped by a gang of thugs while she is working in South America. They take her into the jungle Laura is guarded by some ridiculous native who calls himself \"The Devil\" she has to go though all unpleasant things until they are happy. Maidens are Chained up. The devil demonstrates eating flesh in a horrible manner. Peter Weston, is the devil hunter, who goes into the jungle to try and rescue her,",
    "As the number of Video Nasties I've yet to see dwindles, this little pile of garbage popped up on my \"to rent\" list when I saw it was available.<br /><br />The premise involves a fashion model or something being kidnapped and taken into the jungle to be held for ransom by a motley crew of idiots. Some other goof gets hired to bring her back and is given a sack of money to use as a bargaining chip, though if he returns with the girl and all the money, he gets a significant cut. He's brought a helicopter and pilot with him and, wow, that pilot is one of the worst actors EVER! Granted, they are all totally terrible and the dubbing will make you cry blood. After stealing away into the jungle, we learn that nearby is a cannibal cult whose flesheating earthbound god wanders the woods like a human King Kong looking for tribeswomen to ravage and devour. Now, this fellow is just a naked guy with some of the worst makeup ever, ping-pong balls for eyes and that's pretty much it. His growls and groans are an everpresent feature on the soundtrack, and I found myself muting much of those scenes.<br /><br />Oh, did I forget to mention the almost constant nudity? This is probably the main reason this film was banned, though there is one specific scene, about one second long, where the god attacks a girl and pulls her guts out, but it's not a redeeming factor for gore fans. Also, Jess Franco goes beyond the usual T and A and shows lengthy close-ups of female genitals, and, sadly, male as well. So, if you want \"fair\" in terms of exploitation, you got it.<br /><br />I can't recommend this trash to anyone. It's not even the good bad movie. It's just atrociously padded trash that only a Video Nasty fan will probably view and even then, if you are making your way through the list, leave this for the very last. If you watch it first, you may get the notion that this is the norm for the list, which is certainly not true.",
    "Not sure if I'm referring to those who labeled this a video nasty or to the director...\"Devil Hunter\" sure is one bizarre 'horror' movie.<br /><br />The plot is a loosey goosey combo of superior films like \"Cannibal Ferox\" and \"Cut and Run.\" Chick gets kidnapped in the 'jungle' by a 'tribe' of 'savages.' The jungle looks more like a park somewhere in Mexico. The tribe is like a group of hippies who walk around in Party City-style Halloween costume renditions of tribal garb. And the savages range in race from white to Asian to black to hispanic. I suppose Franco just grabbed anyone who looked even slightly ethnic for this romp.<br /><br />To make matters worse, this film has ultra-minimal gore, no real scares and a lot of unnecessary penis. Not fun. I can find something to like in just about any sleazy Italian or Euro-trash film; this one just fell WAY short.<br /><br />2 out of 10, kids.",
    "This video nasty was initially banned in Britain, and allowed in last November without cuts.<br /><br />It features the Playboy Playmate of the Month October 1979, Ursula Buchfellner. The opening cuts back and forth between Buchfellner and foggy jungle pictures. I am not sure what the purpose of that was. It would have been much better to focus on the bathtub scene.<br /><br />Laura (Buchfellner) is kidnapped and held in the jungle for ransom. Peter (Al Cliver - The Beyond, Zombie) is sent to find her and the ransom. Of course, one of the kidnappers (Antonio de Cabo) manages to pass the time productively, while another (Werner Pochath) whines incessantly.<br /><br />The ransom exchange goes to hell, and Laura runs into the jungle. Will Peter save her before the cannibals have a meal? Oh, yes, there are cannibals in this jungle. Why do you think it was a video nasty! Muriel Montossé is found by Peter and his partner (Antonio Mayans - Angel of Death) on the kidnapper's boat. Montossé is very comfortably undressed. Peter leaves them and goes off alone to find Laura, who has been captured by now. They pass the time having sex, and don't see the danger approaching. Guts, anyone? Great fight between Peter and the naked devil (Burt Altman).<br /><br />Blood, decapitation, guts, lots of full frontal, some great writhing by the cannibal priestess (Aline Mess), and the line, \"They tore her heart out,\" which is hilarious if you see the film.",
    "Of the three titles from Jess Franco to find their way onto the Official DPP Video Nasty list (Devil Hunter, Bloody Moon and Women Behind Bars) this is perhaps the least deserving of notoriety, being a dreadfully dull jungle clunker enlivened only very slightly by a little inept gore, a gratuitous rape scene, and loads of nudity.<br /><br />Gorgeous blonde Ursula Buchfellner plays movie star Laura Crawford who is abducted by a gang of ruthless kidnappers and taken to a remote tropical island inhabited by a savage tribe who worship the 'devil god' that lurks in the jungle (a big, naked, bulging-eyed native who likes to eat the hearts of nubile female sacrifices).<br /><br />Employed by Laura's agent to deliver a $6million ransom, brave mercenary Peter Weston (Al Cliver) and his Vietnam vet pilot pal travel to the island, but encounter trouble when the bad guys attempt a double-cross. During the confusion, Laura escapes into the jungle, but runs straight into the arms of the island's natives, who offer her up to their god.<br /><br />Franco directs in his usual torpid style and loads this laughable effort with his usual dreadful trademarks: crap gore, murky cinematography, rapid zooms, numerous crotch shots, out of focus imagery, awful sound effects, and ham-fisted editing. The result is a dire mess that is a real struggle to sit through from start to finish (It took me a couple of sittings to finish the thing), and even the sight of the luscious Buchfellner in all of her natural glory ain't enough to make me revisit this film in a hurry.",
    "How can you tell that a horror movie is terrible? when you can't stop laughing about it of course! The plot has been well covered by other reviewers, so I'll just add a few things on the hilarity of it all.<br /><br />Some reviews have placed the location in South America, others in Africa, I thought it was in some random island in the Pacific. Where exactly does this take place, seems to be a mystery. The cannibal tribe is conformed by a couple of black women some black men, and a man who looks like a young Frank Zappa banging the drums... the Devil God is a large black man with a terrible case of pink eyes.<br /><br />One of the \"freakiest\" moments in the film is when, \"Pablito\" find his partner hanging from a tree covered in what seems to be an orange substance that I assume is blood, starts screaming for minutes on and on (that's actually funny), and then the head of his partner falls in the ground and \"Pablito\" kicks it a bit for what I assume is \"shits n' giggles\" and the eyes actually move...<br /><br />But, of course, then the \"freak\" is gone when you realize the eyes moved because the movie is just bad...<br /><br />I hadn't laughed like this in a loooong while, and I definitely recommend this film for a Sunday afternoon with your friends and you have nothing to do... grab a case of beers and start watching this film, you'll love it! If you are looking for a real horror or gore movie, though... don't' bother.",
    "An actress making a movie in Africa is kidnapped and taken into the jungle where she is held for ransom. The producer hires some one to go and bring her back. Complicating everything are the cannibals in the jungle who worship a really ugly looking \"god\" who likes to eat naked women.<br /><br />This is a gory sleazy movie. There is copious amounts of nudity and violence, not to mention violence against nude people. Its an exploitation film designed to appeal to the deepest darkest parts of our being, and if the movie wasn't so boring this film would be a classic. Lets face it, despite the gore, the nasty sex and abuse,and the ugly monster this movie is a snoozer. The pacing is all off kilter and it puts you out. There are multiple plot lines that all seem to be happening separately from each other, even though its ultimately all one story. Worst of all, almost no one says anything. Most of the minimal dialog concerns the cruelty or one characters protestations that \"I'll do what I want\". Its such a quiet and dull movie that if it weren't for the frequent screams of the victims I'd recommend this as a sleep aide.<br /><br />This is a movie to avoid unless you need sleep, or unless you need to see every Euro-cannibal movie.<br /><br />(An aside. VideoAsia just released this as part of their Terror Tales series. Their print is oddly letter-boxed which looks to be the result of taking their print from a Japanese source (there is fogging) that was cropped to remove the subtitles. Their print also has no opening titles)",
    "or anyone who was praying for the sight of Al Cliver wrestling a naked, 7ft tall black guy into a full nelson, your film has arrived! Film starlet Laura Crawford (Ursula Buchfellner) is kidnapped by a group who demand the ransom of $6 million to be delivered to their island hideaway. What they don't count on is rugged Vietnam vet Peter Weston (Cliver) being hired by a film producer to save the girl. And what they really didn't count on was a local tribe that likes to offer up young women to their monster cannibal god with bloodshot bug eyes.<br /><br />Pretty much the same filming set up as CANNIBALS, this one fares a bit better when it comes to entertainment value, thanks mostly a hilarious dub track and the impossibly goofy monster with the bulging eyes (Franco confirms they were split ping pong balls on the disc's interview). Franco gets a strong EuroCult supporting cast including Gisela Hahn (CONTAMINATION) and Werner Pochath (whose death is one of the most head-scratching things I ever seen as a guy who is totally not him is shown - in close up - trying to be him). The film features tons of nudity and the gore (Tempra paint variety) is there. The highlight for me was the world's slowly fistfight between Cliver and Antonio de Cabo in the splashing waves. Sadly, ol' Jess pads this one out to an astonishing (and, at times, agonizing) 1 hour and 40 minutes when it should have run 80 minutes tops. <br /><br />For the most part, the Severin DVD looks pretty nice but there are some odd ghosting images going on during some of the darker scenes. Also, one long section of dialog is in Spanish with no subs (they are an option, but only when you listen to the French track). Franco gives a nice 16- minute interview about the film and has much more pleasant things to say about Buchfellner than his CANNIBALS star Sabrina Siani.",
    "Devil Hunter gained notoriety for the fact that it's on the DPP 'Video Nasty' list, but it really needn't have been. Many films on the list where there for God (and DPP) only known reasons, and while this isn't the tamest of the bunch; there isn't a lot here that warrants banning...which is a shame because I never would have sat through it where it not for the fact that it's on 'the shopping list'. The plot actually gives the film a decent base - or at least more of a decent base than most cannibal films - and it follows an actress who is kidnapped and dragged off into the Amazon jungle. A hunter is then hired to find her, but along the way he has to brave the natives, lead by a man who calls himself \"The Devil\" (hence the title). The film basically just plods along for eighty five minutes and there really aren't many scenes of interest. It's a real shame that Jess Franco ended up making films like this because the man clearly has talent; as seen by films such as The Diabolical Dr Z, Venus in Furs, Faceless and She Kills in Ecstasy, but unfortunately his good films are just gems amongst heaps of crap and Devil Hunter is very much a part of the crap. I saw this film purely because I want to be able to say I've seen everything on the DPP's list (just two more to go!), and I'm guessing that's why most other people who have seen it, saw it. But if you're not on the lookout for Nasties; there really is no reason to bother with this one.",
    "This film seemed way too long even at only 75 minutes. The problem with jungle horror films is that there is always way too much footage of people walking (through the jungle, up a rocky cliff, near a river or lake) to pad out the running time. The film is worth seeing for the laughable and naked native zombie with big bulging, bloody eyes which is always accompanied on the soundtrack with heavy breathing and lots of reverb. Eurotrash fans will be plenty entertained by the bad English dubbing, gratuitous female flesh and very silly makeup jobs on the monster and native extras. For a zombie/cannibal flick this was pretty light on the gore but then I probably didn't see an uncut version.",
    "Not only is it a disgustingly made low-budget bad-acted movie, but the plot itself is just STUPID!!!<br /><br />A mystic man that eats women? (And by the looks, not virgin ones)<br /><br />Ridiculous!!! If you´ve got nothing better to do (like sleeping) you should watch this. Yeah right.",
    "This is the worst thing the TMNT franchise has ever spawned. I was a kid when this came out and I still thought it was deuce, even though I liked the original cartoon.<br /><br />There's this one scene I remember when the mafia ape guy explains to his minions what rhetorical questions are. It's atrocious. Many fans hate on the series for including a female turtle, but that didn't bother me. So much so that I didn't even remember her until I read about the show recently. All in all, it's miserably forgettable.<br /><br />The only okay thing was the theme song. Guilty pleasure, they call it... Nananana ninja...",
    "This is the biggest insult to TMNT ever. Fortunantely, officially Venus does not exist in canon TMNT. There will never be a female turtle, this took away from the tragic tale of 4 male unique mutants who will never have a family of their own, once gone no more. The biggest mistake was crossing over Power Rangers to TMNT with a horrible episode; the turtle's voices were WRONG and they all acted out of character. They could have done such a better job, better designs and animatronics and NO VENUS. <br /><br />don't bother with this people...it's cringe worthy material. the lip flap was slow and unnatural looking. they totally disrespected shredder. the main baddie, some dragonlord dude was corny. the turtles looked corny with things hanging off their bodies, what's with the thing around raph's thigh? the silly looking sculpted plastrons!? <br /><br />If they looked normal, acted in character and got rid of Venus, got rid of the stupid kiddie cartoon sounds...and better writing it could have been good.",
    "I did not like the idea of the female turtle at all since 1987 we knew the TMNT to be four brothers with their teacher Splinter and their enemies and each one of the four brothers are named after the great artists name like Leonardo , Michelangleo, Raphel and Donatello so Venus here doesn't have any meaning or playing any important part and I believe that the old TMNT series was much more better than that new one which contains Venus As a female turtle will not add any action to the story we like the story of the TMNT we knew in 1987 to have new enemies in every part is a good point to have some action but to have a female turtle is a very weak point to have some action, we wish to see more new of TMNT series but just as the same characters we knew in 1987 without that female turtle.",
    "This film is terrible. You don't really need to read this review further. If you are planning on watching it, suffice to say - don't (unless you are studying how not to make a good movie).<br /><br />The acting is horrendous... serious amateur hour. Throughout the movie I thought that it was interesting that they found someone who speaks and looks like Michael Madsen, only to find out that it is actually him! A new low even for him!!<br /><br />The plot is terrible. People who claim that it is original or good have probably never seen a decent movie before. Even by the standard of Hollywood action flicks, this is a terrible movie.<br /><br />Don't watch it!!! Go for a jog instead - at least you won't feel like killing yourself.",
    "Terrible movie. Nuff Said.<br /><br />These Lines are Just Filler. The movie was bad. Why I have to expand on that I don't know. This is already a waste of my time. I just wanted to warn others. Avoid this movie. The acting sucks and the writing is just moronic. Bad in every way. The only nice thing about the movie are Deniz Akkaya's breasts. Even that was ruined though by a terrible and unneeded rape scene. The movie is a poorly contrived and totally unbelievable piece of garbage.<br /><br />OK now I am just going to rag on IMDb for this stupid rule of 10 lines of text minimum. First I waste my time watching this offal. Then feeling compelled to warn others I create an account with IMDb only to discover that I have to write a friggen essay on the film just to express how bad I think it is. Totally unnecessary.",
    "Assuming this won't end up a straight-to-video release, I would have to say void this title at all costs. Unless you're bored of good, well-executed movies, that is. I saw this last night at AFI Dallas, and I left with 20 minutes remaining, simply because I didn't care anymore (about the plot, not about insulting the director...that is awkward). When you can spot a goof only 5 minutes into the movie (a shot out, shattered window before any shots are fired...and then the window breaks with the first shot), things are going to bad. Let's just say this is only an indicator of things to come...unfortunately.<br /><br />I'll spare you all the details, but this is sub-par in every manner, even the half-assed acting by Michael Madsen is disappointing when you're expecting half-assed acting from him. And the rape scene...Christ! \"Shut up and take it\" should never be used in a rape scene. EVER.<br /><br />3/10",
    "Sometimes a movie is so comprehensively awful it has a destructive effect on your morale. You begin to really ask yourself, what does it mean for our society that the standard is so terribly low? Can they honestly expect that we'll endure this many clichés and still be entertained?<br /><br />Of course, it is still a Hollywood mainstay to make the GUN the major character, plot device, and the source of all conflict and resolution in films. Character needs a gun. Gets a gun. Can't do that because he has a gun. Puts his gun down first. OH MY GOD What are we going to do!? He has a gun! He waves it around, acting more malicious than real human beings ever do. He pushes it in someone's face for 90 minutes, shouting questions. The hallmark of any conclusion will be the comforting sound of police sirens. <br /><br />It's a real challenge to make such a tired, hackneyed formula work again; a film has to be very clever and well executed. This one is neither. It has no life and no personality, and it will suck these components from YOU. it will make you feel WORSE about living in the time and space that you do. Really, who needs that!? So yes, I'll say it: I think this may well be the worst film I have ever seen. Anyone who was involved in the making of this sub- mediocre soul killing trash should be publicly embarrassed for the disservice they've done to us all.",
    "I have to congratulate the genius who approved this one. Edward Furlong, you're not as good as you think mate, you can't grab on every piece of low-cost amateur crap, which sole intention has to be to get some bucks.<br /><br />The filming is bad, and I mean BAD. Anyone with a camera would get the same result, or better.<br /><br />The acting, lets just say: don't go to the supermarket looking for actors. The good ones usually come with a degree or, at least, have some damn experience! The director.. Mr. Jon Keeyes, please find your purpose in life, as a director you simply suck. Your directing is poor, the angles are all messed up (not in a good way), the lines seem as if they're being read out of toilet paper, and the damn music.. it always comes up when it shouldn't and goes out for no apparent reason. And don't go for writer either, by the way. Making movies isn't like serving on a coffeshop, it requires art and skill, things I really doubt you'll ever have.<br /><br />Instead of making a badass shootout movie, you should've shot this one back to oblivion and wait 'till something good came up.. Or just go find a job on a coffeshop. You'll have less stress and you'll save movie goers some money and a bad night.<br /><br />vote: 1/10 (my first one)",
    "I rented this one on DVD without any prior knowledge. I was suspicious seeing Michael Madsen appearing in a movie I have never heard of, but it was a freebie, so why not check it out.<br /><br />Well my guess is that Mr. Blonde would very much like to forget he's ever taken part in such a shame of a film.<br /><br />Apparently, if your script and dialogs are terrible, even good actors cannot save the day. Not to mention the amateur actors that flood this film. Too many non-native-English-speakers play parts of native-English-speakers, reading out lines from a script that should have been thrown away and not having been made into a movie. It's unbelievable how unbelievable all the lines in the movie sound. The music is awful and totally out of place, and the whole thing looks and sounds like a poor school play.<br /><br />I recommend you watch it just so you would appreciate other, better, movies. This is why I gave it a 3 instead of the 1 it deserves.",
    "I saw this DVD in my friends house and thought that this was a Turkish action movie with some Hollywood-not very big-names in it. Interested enough I decide to give it a shot later.. It was a tough to bear experience believe me. Then, after finally seeing the credits roll I tought 'We Turks really suck at Hollywood style film making.. This is an insult to the heist|hostage movie genre..' but then wait! I checked some names and no, they were not Turkish names and no, this was not a Turkish movie; on the contrary it was literally shot in America with an American director & crew! That made me thinking-again!- How on earth can you persuade names like Micheal Madsen, Edward Furlong or even Arnold Vosloo to take part in such a project? with money probably.. That kept me thinking further.. How can you raise such amount of money to offer them and a supposedly international cast? Then all my meditation paid off and I came to find the answer.By hiring the cheapest equipment and crew that you can find. And if you still have to difficulty in adjustin your budget then: by writing and directing the movie you are trying to produce-or vice versa I don't have any information on that-. So bottom line this is not a bad movie as everybody are so anxious to present as.. It makes you think -in my case even meditate- and there are a lot of movies outthere that doesn't give even that affect.. This one at least makes you think; It makes you wonder.. It leaves you with disbelief.. and then It makes you wonder again..",
    "What was with all the Turkish actors? No offense but I thought it was all for nothing for all these actors. The film had no script to test any actors acting skill or ability. It demanded next to nothing I bought this film to see Michael Madsen. He is one of my favorite actors but this film was another failure for him. The script was so bad. Their was just nothing to sink your teeth into and all the characters were two dimensional. Madsen tried to act like a hard ass but the script and direction didn't even allow him to do enough with his character to make it more interesting or 3 dimensional.<br /><br />Even the sound effects of the gunfight at the beginning of the film sounded like the noise of paint ball guns when they are fired in a skirmish. It was really weird and they didn't sound like real guns. A video game had better sound effects than this film. There was also a really annoying bloke at the beginning of the film who was a member of the robbery gang. He had this American whining voice like a girl shouting lines like \"Lets get the F#$k out of here\" and What are we going to do man\". He sounded like a girl. As a positive It was funny to watch and it made me laugh too. For a few seconds. Whoo Hoo ! Dumb Film. Poor Madsen. He will bounce back...",
    "This movie was terrible. at first i just read the plot summary and it looked OK, so i watched it. The acting was TERRIBLE. it was like the actor were almost camera shy. everything seemed fake. i feel bad for Edward Furlong, terminator 2 was my favorite a few years ago.. I've watched it at least 20 times....<br /><br />the plot was also crap. the writers were probably sleep deprived when they came up with the lines.<br /><br />on the plus side, it's the good kind of bad movie. the one you keep watching just to see how much worst could it will get, so that later you can tell other people how you couldn't believe how terrible the movie was.<br /><br />i think everybody should watch this, so that then we could appreciate better other, REAL, movies.",
    "I am a big fan of Arnold Vosloo. Finally seeing him as the star of a recent movie, not just a bit part, made me happy.<br /><br />Unfortunately I took film appreciation in college and the only thing I can say that I didn't like was that the film was made in an abandoned part of town and there was no background traffic or lookie loos.<br /><br />I have to say that the acting leaves something to be desired, but Arnold is an excellent actor, I have to chalk it up to lousy direction and the supporting cast leaves something to be desired.<br /><br />I love Arnold Vosloo, and he made the film viewable. Otherwise, I would have written it off as another lousy film.<br /><br />I found the rape scene brutal and unnecessary, but the actors that got away at the end were pretty good. But the sound effects of the shoot-out were pretty bad. There are some glitches in the film (continuity) but they are overlookable considering the low-caliber of the film.<br /><br />All in all I enjoyed the film, because Arnold Vosloo was in it.<br /><br />Jackie",
    "This is an art film that was either made in 1969 or 1972 (the National Film Preservation Foundation says 1969 and IMDb says 1972). Regardless of the exact date, the film definitely appears to be very indicative of this general time period--with some camera-work and pop art stylings that are pure late 60s-early 70s.<br /><br />The film consists of three simple images that are distorted using different weird camera tricks. These distorted images are accompanied by music and there is absolutely no dialog or plot of any sort. This was obviously intended as almost like a form of performance art, and like most performance art, it's interesting at first but quickly becomes tiresome. The film, to put it even more bluntly, is a total bore and would appeal to no one but perhaps those who made the film, their family and friends and perhaps a few people just too hip and \"with it\" to be understood by us mortals.",
    "Nine minutes of psychedelic, pulsating, often symmetric abstract images, are enough to drive anyone crazy. I did spot a full-frame eye at the start, and later some birds silhouetted against other colors. It was just not my cup of tea. It's about 8½ minutes too long.",
    "There are lots of extremely good-looking people in this movie. That's probably the best thing about it. Perhaps that even makes it worth watching.<br /><br />\"Loaded\" tells the story of Tristan Price (Jesse Metcalfe), a young man who's about to make his mark on the world. He's the son of a well-to-do family with a good reputation, and he's on his way to law school. But like so many such settings, things aren't quite as perfect as they appear. The expectations in this family far outweigh the love. Except for school, Tristan's father rarely lets him leave the house. This seems to be the result of some past traumatic event that shook the family, which is partially revealed through flashbacks but isn't spelled out until the very end. Tristan's claustrophobic environment causes him to let loose in very extreme ways at the first possible opportunity, when his friends take him out to a strip club to celebrate his graduation. The celebration soon follows some strippers back to a beach house party, and from there, Tristan befriends Sebastian Cole (Corey Large), who pulls him into a drug dealing underworld.<br /><br />While technically well-made, this movie suffers from a lackluster script and a storyline that isn't very engaging. Also counting against this film are some constant camera tricks that generally seemed annoying and out-of-place, such as slow-motion, fast-motion, freeze-frames and echos. These are the types of effects a director might normally utilize to show a character's perspective while on drugs, except in this case they seem to have been sporadically tossed in at random points, in some cheap attempt at style.<br /><br />Despite its cast of relative unknowns, performances were good all around, most notably with respect to the main antagonist (Corey Large). I suspect we'll be seeing at least a couple of these people in bigger and better projects in the future.<br /><br />Of course, when mentioning the actors, I must mention their looks. Rating based on hotness, this movies scores an 11. The women in this movie are incredible-looking and almost distract you from what a boring movie you're watching. I'm sure the male characters are also quite attractive, but you'll have to ask someone else to comment on that.<br /><br />Overall, I can't recommend this movie, not for buying, renting, or even seeing for free. It's unfortunately just not worth the effort it takes to sit through.",
    "This is it. This is the one. This is the worst movie ever made. Ever. It beats everything. I have never seen worse. Retire the trophy and give it to these people.....there's just no comparison.<br /><br />Even three days after watching this (for some reason I still don't know why) I cannot believe how insanely horrific this movie is/was. Its so bad. So far from anything that could be considered a movie, a story or anything that should have ever been created and brought into our existence.<br /><br />This made me question whether or not humans are truly put on this earth to do good. It made me feel disgusted with ourselves and our progress as a species in this universe. This type of movie sincerely hurts us as a society. We should be ashamed. I really cannot emphasize that our global responsibility as people living here and creating art, is that we need to prevent the creation of these gross distortions of our reality for our own good. It's an embarrassment. I don't know how on earth any of these actors, writers, or the director of this film sleeps at night knowing that they had a role in making \"Loaded\". I don't know what type of disgusting monsters enjoy watching these types of movies.<br /><br />That being said, I love a good \"bad\" movie. I love Shark Attack 3, I love Bad Taste, they are HILARIOUS. I tell all my friends to see them because they are \"bad\".<br /><br />But this.......this crosses the line of \"bad\" into a whole new dimension. This is awkward bad. This is the bad where you know everything that is going to happen, every line, every action, every death, every sequence BEFORE they happen; and not just like a second or two before, I mean like, after watching the first 5 minutes before.<br /><br />Every cheesy editing \"effect\" is shamelessly used over and over again to a sickening point. I really never want to see the \"shaky\" camera \"drug buzz rush\" effect or jump cuts or swerve cuts or ANY FANCY CUT EVER AGAIN EVER. This is meticulously boring, repetitive and just tortures the audience.<br /><br />But.......and let me be specific here, the most DISTURBING thing about this movie is that given the production, it appears that a somewhat decent amount of money was actually put into this excrement. I personally will grab the shoulders of the director if I ever see him and shake him into submission, demanding that he run home and swallow two-gallons of Drain-O or I will do it for him.<br /><br />If we ever needed a new form of inhumane torture for our war prisoners abroad, just keep showing them this movie in a padded cell over and over again. Trust me, I think they will become more extravagant with suicide methods after the 72nd time of sitting through this.<br /><br />Stop these movies, they are just the most vile of all facets of our society. Please. Stop. NOW.",
    "There are times when finishing a film one wishes to have a refund for the time just spent. This was one of those times. I almost gave up with only 15 minutes left to endure... and I wish I had...<br /><br />The pace that a man goes from a straight-laced, controlled life to one of complete spinelessness and irresponsibility could never be this rapid.<br /><br />From a graduation celebration to the predictable ending Tristan Price (Jesse Metcalfe) man of privilege and culture allows himself to be seduced by a woman, by violence, and by mind altering substances. Of course, the woman part is understandable when observing the talents of the beautiful April (Nathalie Kelley). But the in for a penny in for a pound aspect of the drugs, violence and dedication to a person he has just met is impossible to understand.<br /><br />Frankly, besides being able to stare at Nathalie Kelley and Monica Keena, this film has no redeeming qualities. Save your money, save your time... do anything else...",
    "Weak plot, predictable violence, only semi interesting characters. Like the writer (also one of the stars?) was fictionalizing his own screw ups and added an incredulous fantasies of drugs and murder to make it \"hot\". From the predictable rap and house soundtrack, to the family conflicts, it's poorly acted, stereotypical, and ultimately terribly boring. Even the title has been done before - IMDb lists FIVE movies with the same name released in 2007-2008!! <br /><br />Note: Saw it on Showtime, which listed the synopsis for one of the other movies. Was halfway thru before I realized no one was an undercover cop. Even tho another stereotype, would have made it interesting if it happened.",
    "All I could think of while watching this movie was B-grade slop. Many have spoken about it's redeeming quality is how this film portrays such a realistic representation of the effects of drugs and an individual and their subsequent spiral into a self perpetuation state of unfortunate events. Yet really, the techniques used (as many have already mentioned) were overused and thus unconvincing and irrelevant to the film as a whole.<br /><br />As far as the plot is concerned, it was lacklustre, unimaginative, implausible and convoluted. You can read most other reports on this film and they will say pretty much the same as I would.<br /><br />Granted some of the actors and actresses are attractive but when confronted with such boring action... looks can only carry a film so far. The action is poor and intermittent: a few punches thrown here and there, and a final gunfight towards the end. Nothing really to write home about.<br /><br />As others have said, 'BAD' movies are great to watch for the very reason that they are 'bad', you revel in that fact. This film, however, is a void. It's nothing.<br /><br />Furthermore, if one is really in need of an educational movie to scare people away from drug use then I would seriously recommend any number of other movies out there that board such issues in a much more effective way. 'Requiem For A Dream', 'Trainspotting', 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' and 'Candy' are just a few examples. Though one should also check out some more lighthearted films on the same subject like 'Go' (overall, both serious and funny) and 'Halfbaked'.<br /><br />On a final note, the one possibly redeeming line in this movie, delivered by Vinnie Jones was stolen from 'Lock, Stock and Two Smokling Barrels'. To think that a bit of that great movie has been tainted by 'Loaded' is vile.<br /><br />Overall, I strongly suggest that you save you money and your time by NOT seeing this movie.",
    "If you look at Corey Large's information here on IMDb, apparently there's a movie called \"Reload\" in production (as of June '08) in which he's playing a character named Sebastian Cole.<br /><br />First of all, how does such a crappy movie ever earn a sequel ... and second, didn't Sebastian get killed at the end of \"Loaded\"?<br /><br />I watched this in the wee hours of the morning when I was battling insomnia, and so I was drifting in and out while it was on. I'm sure I missed some plot points, but overall, it seemed really weak. Large's performance was (for me) one of the stronger parts of the film. I'm also a bit surprised at all the people commenting on the beautiful girls, since I thought the actress playing Brooke was pretty, but not exceptional.",
    "This film had a lot of promise, and the plot was relatively interesting, however the actors, director and editors seriously let this film down.<br /><br />I feel bad for the writers, it could have been good. The acting is wooden, very few of the characters are believable.<br /><br />Who ever edited this clearly just learnt some new edit techniques and wanted to splash them all over the film. There are lots of quick 'flashy' edits in almost every scene, which are clearly meant to be symbolic but just end up as annoying.<br /><br />I wanted to like this film and expected there to be a decent resolution to the breakdown of equilibrium but alas no, it left me feeling like I'd wasted my time and the film makers had wasted their money.",
    "This is one of the dumbest films, I've ever seen. It rips off nearly ever type of thriller and manages to make a mess of them all.<br /><br />There's not a single good line or character in the whole mess. If there was a plot, it was an afterthought and as far as acting goes, there's nothing good to say so Ill say nothing. I honestly cant understand how this type of nonsense gets produced and actually released, does somebody somewhere not at some stage think, 'Oh my god this really is a load of shite' and call it a day. Its crap like this that has people downloading illegally, the trailer looks like a completely different film, at least if you have download it, you haven't wasted your time or money Don't waste your time, this is painful.",
    "6/10 Acting, not great but some good acting.<br /><br />4/10 Director, makes some stupid decisions for this film.<br /><br />2/10 Writer, story makes no sense at all and has huge amount of flaws.<br /><br />4/10 Overall score for this movie.<br /><br />Don't waste your time with this film, it's not worth it. I gave 4 for this movie and it may be too much. Characters are so over exaggerated than they can ever be in real life and some pretty unexplainable stuff happens \"storywise\", not in good way. Because of the style this film has been filmed you get bored after 30 minutes (too many special effects: slow motions and camera shakes and fast forwards). It's always good that movie uses music to make the story go smooth but there's too many tracks in this one. In the first hour there is almost 50/50 dialogs and musics",
    "This is really a new low in entertainment. Even though there are a lot worse movies out.<br /><br />In the Gangster / Drug scene genre it is hard to have a convincing storyline (this movies does not, i mean Sebastians motives for example couldn't be more far fetched and worn out cliché.) Then you would also need a setting of character relationships that is believable (this movie does not.) <br /><br />Sure Tristan is drawn away from his family but why was that again? what's the deal with his father again that he has to ask permission to go out at his age? interesting picture though to ask about the lack and need of rebellious behavior of kids in upper class family. But this movie does not go in this direction. Even though there would be the potential judging by the random Backflashes. Wasn't he already down and out, why does he do it again? <br /><br />So there are some interesting questions brought up here for a solid socially critic drama (but then again, this movie is just not, because of focusing on \"cool\" production techniques and special effects an not giving the characters a moment to reflect and most of all forcing the story along the path where they want it to be and not paying attention to let the story breath and naturally evolve.) <br /><br />It wants to be a drama to not glorify abuse of substances and violence (would be political incorrect these days, wouldn't it?) but on the other hand it is nothing more then a cheap action movie (like there are so so many out there) with an average set of actors and a Vinnie Jones who is managing to not totally ruin what's left of his reputation by doing what he always does.<br /><br />So all in all i .. just ... can't recommend it.<br /><br />1 for Vinnie and 2 for the editing.",
    "From the beginning of the movie, it gives the feeling the director is trying to portray something, what I mean to say that instead of the story dictating the style in which the movie should be made, he has gone in the opposite way, he had a type of move that he wanted to make, and wrote a story to suite it. And he has failed in it very badly. I guess he was trying to make a stylish movie. Any way I think this movie is a total waste of time and effort. In the credit of the director, he knows the media that he is working with, what I am trying to say is I have seen worst movies than this. Here at least the director knows to maintain the continuity in the movie. And the actors also have given a decent performance.",
    "I basically skimmed through the movie but just enough to catch watch the plot was about. To tell you the truth it was kind of boring to me and at some spots it didn't make sense. The only reason I watched this movie in the first place was to see CHACE CRAWFORD!!! He is so hot, but in this movie his hair was kind of weird. But still hot.<br /><br />However, despite how hot CHACE is, it really did not make up for the film. I guess the plot isn't that bad but what really threw me over was the fact that they cuss in like every sentence. Is it that hard to express your anger without saying the F word every time?The cussing was annoying and the whole flashy, camera shaking thing gave me a headache.<br /><br />All in all, although the plot was OK, I found the film to be a bore and over dramatic. That's why I only cut to scenes with CHACE in it. LOL Anyways, not worth renting unless your a die-hard fan of a specific cast member like I was. Oh yeah the cast was Hot. The girls were HOT!!! But CHACE IS THE BEST!!",
    "This fanciful horror flick has Vincent Price playing a mad magician that realizes his vocational talents have been sold to another. He devise ways of avenging all those that have wronged him. His master scheme seems to back fire on him.<br /><br />Price is a little below par compared to his masterpieces, but is still the only reason to watch this thriller. Supporting cast includes Patrick O'Neal, Mary Murphy, Eva Gabor and Jay Novello.<br /><br />",
    "If I had not read Pat Barker's 'Union Street' before seeing this film, I would have liked it. Unfortuntately this is not the case. It is actually my kind of film, it is well made, and in no way do I want to say otherwise, but as an adaptation, it fails from every angle.<br /><br />The harrowing novel about the reality of living in a northern England working-class area grabbed hold of my heartstrings and refused to let go for weeks after I had finished. I was put through tears, repulsion, shock, anger, sympathy and misery when reading about the women of Union Street. Excellent. A novel that at times I felt I could not read any more of, but I novel I simply couldn't put down. Depressing yes, but utterly gripping.<br /><br />The film. Oh dear. Hollywood took Barker's truth and reality, and showered a layer of sweet icing sugar over the top of it. A beautiful film, an inspiring soundtrack, excellent performances, a tale of hope and romance...yes. An adaptation of 'Union Street'...no.<br /><br />The women of Union Street and their stories are condensed into Fonda's character, their stories are touched on, but many are discarded. I accept that some of Barker's tales are sensitive issues and are too horrific for mass viewing, and that a film with around 7 leading protagonists just isn't practical, but the content is not my main issue. The essence and the real gut of the novel is lost - darkness and rain, broken windows covered with cardboard, and the graphically described stench of poverty is replaced with sunshine, pretty houses, and a twinkling William's score.<br /><br />If you enjoyed the film for its positivity and hope in the face of 'reality', I advise that you hesitate to read the book without first preparing yourself for something more like 'Schindler's List'...but without the happy ending.",
    "I saw the capsule comment said \"great acting.\" In my opinion, these are two great actors giving horrible performances, and with zero chemistry with one another, for a great director in his all-time worst effort. Robert De Niro has to be the most ingenious and insightful illiterate of all time. Jane Fonda's performance uncomfortably drifts all over the map as she clearly has no handle on this character, mostly because the character is so poorly written. Molasses-like would be too swift an adjective for this film's excruciating pacing. Although the film's intent is to be an uplifting story of curing illiteracy, watching it is a true \"bummer.\" I give it 1 out of 10, truly one of the worst 20 movies for its budget level that I have ever seen.",
    "Robert DeNiro plays the most unbelievably intelligent illiterate of all time. This movie is so wasteful of talent, it is truly disgusting. The script is unbelievable. The dialog is unbelievable. Jane Fonda's character is a caricature of herself, and not a funny one. The movie moves at a snail's pace, is photographed in an ill-advised manner, and is insufferably preachy. It also plugs in every cliche in the book. Swoozie Kurtz is excellent in a supporting role, but so what?<br /><br />Equally annoying is this new IMDB rule of requiring ten lines for every review. When a movie is this worthless, it doesn't require ten lines of text to let other readers know that it is a waste of time and tape. Avoid this movie.",
    "Story of a man who has unnatural feelings for a pig. Starts out with a opening scene that is a terrific example of absurd comedy. A formal orchestra audience is turned into an insane, violent mob by the crazy chantings of it's singers. Unfortunately it stays absurd the WHOLE time with no general narrative eventually making it just too off putting. Even those from the era should be turned off. The cryptic dialogue would make Shakespeare seem easy to a third grader. On a technical level it's better than you might think with some good cinematography by future great Vilmos Zsigmond. Future stars Sally Kirkland and Frederic Forrest can be seen briefly.",
    "Ah, Bait. How do I hate thee? Let me count the ways. 1. You try to be funny, but are corny and unenjoyable; every joke is predictable and expected, and when it comes, does not inspire laughter. Instead, I want to hurl. 2. You try to be dramatic, but are unbelievable; the woman overacts to a terrible degree, and the \"bad guy\" looks like Bill Gates, and is about as scary as...well, Bill Gates. (Just try to imagine Bill Gates trying to intimidate somebody with a gun. Doesn't work, does it? A lawyer, maybe, but not a gun. Doesn't fit.) As for Jamie Foxx, well, just watching him try to deliver a dramatic and heartfelt dialogue is ludicrous, and makes me want to hurl. 3. You try to be action-packed, but instead are dull and dragging too many times. And when the action heats up, the tripod for the camera must have been lost, for the scenes wobble more than those in The Blair Witch Project, and I find myself nauseated, and once again I want to hurl. 4. You try to be a good movie, but you failed, you FAILED, YOU FAILED! I would rather walk barefoot across the Sahara with a pack full of beef jerky and no water, no sunscreen, and only Meryl Streep for company. This hell would be lovelier than a single minute more spent watching everyone in Bait overact their way through an idiotically written story with Bill Gates for a bad guy, and let's not even talk about the massive bomb that goes off in a car that Jamie Foxx's character has just driven OFF A CLIFF, but somehow manages to escape...just kill me now, or do the right thing and promise me that somehow I'll never have to watch a movie that is this bad, ever again.",
    "The premise of the movie has been explained and if you've gotten this far you don't me to pretend that I'm a movie critic. With that being said my own opinion of the movie is quite low. I'm a fan of Takashi Miike but this goes down in the category of his not so great work along with DOA 2 and 3, and some others (many).<br /><br />The movie seems to get a free pass because it is a Takashi film and nothing Takashi does can be wrong. This is a highschoolers approach to cinema. For the rest of us we'll find and hour and a half of a kid screaming for no real reason completely annoying (and yes, this does take away from the film), the pace of the film almost reaching levels of rigomortis, and the acting...well...hmmm. <br /><br />If one is a Takashi fan you'll see it regardless to peak your interests. It lacks any originality (see the Neverending Story) or any character development from the lead character in the face of conflict other then a quite superficial one. <br /><br />As it has been pointed out this is the first film Miike has been credited with co-writing, but that doesn't mean much as non of what we'd hope would be Miike's personality would spill over into the screen. All we get are some of the token Miike shots vis the director of photography.<br /><br />The movie had the potential to be something great. The premise is not a difficult one to run wild with. But this one seemed to have been run into the ground.<br /><br />My suggestion is if you're just getting into Miike is go with some of the standards like Gozu, Ichi, and Audition. Then movie into his works like Blue's Harp, Fudoh, Rainy Dog, Bird People of China.",
    "Uninspired direction leaves a decent cast stranded in a handsome but bland adaptation, in which dialogue seems recited rather than heartfelt, and cash strapped appearances by the ghosts fail to round up any sense of awe or magic; Edward Woodward, as the Ghost of Christmas Present, wobbles around on stilts and seems to be doing an impression of Bernard Cribbins. As Scrooge, George C. Scott is too wry, and he never seems to truly believe in it, which robs his performance of its effect. The scenes in which he's shown his past have as much impact as if he was half-heartedly flicking through his family album. No one else seems to be putting any effort in, except Frank Finlay, who chronically overacts.",
    "I was sooooo excited to see this movie after finally reading the book this week. My 13 year old son was looking forward to it too. I rented it and snuggled down to enjoy a classic holiday story brought to life on screen.<br /><br />Boy, was I disappointed. This movie veered off from the book more times than is forgivable. George C. Scott is an excellent actor but in this, it seemed that he was fully into character only about 20% of the time. The rest of the time he was quite flat.<br /><br />I realize that this was made in '84, pre-CG effects, for the most part. But it looked to be very B-movie quality, especially the encounter with Jacob Marley.<br /><br />The biggest disappointment was the fact that they left out one of the most moving parts of the story: When the Spirit of Christmas Present takes Scrooge on the whirlwind tour of the world, observing people in the bleakest of circumstances still having the light and love of Christmastime.<br /><br />I will admit that Mr. Scott did a good job with the \"reformed\" Scrooge at the end. That was a refreshing portrayal.<br /><br />I wish that Bob Cratchit had been portrayed as a little more ragged and down-trodden. And Tiny Tim... oh don't even get me started on bad child actors...",
    "Having seen three other versions of the same film, I am afraid for me this is by far the weakest, primarily due to Scott's rather dull and leaden performance. His emotions throughout are so bland it makes it difficult to engage in the film. Alistair Sim portrayed the role infinitely better. When Scrooge was at his meanest, you don't get the sense Scott is saying the dialogue with much conviction and when he undergoes his metamorphosis he is similarly unconvincing. I cannot think of any actors in this film who match those from the Alistair Sim version. Even the musical version (and frankly the Muppets) take on this are better executed. Very disappointing.",
    "Saw this movie in my English class this afternoon and was surprised by how bad this version was. Don't get me wrong, George C. Scott was terrific as Scrooge, but the rest of the cast fails so very badly. Sometimes I couldn't stop laughing at the stupid acting and the repeated line: \"Merry Christmas to everyone!\" Other times I almost fell asleep.<br /><br />The movie is based on a Charles Dickens short story about a rich guy, who don't think Christmas is nothing but humbug. After 30 minutes, the rich guy is visited by three ghosts, who persuade him to celebrate Christmas after all.<br /><br />I can not understand how this movie, with a script so bad it must have been written in five minutes, can be so well-rated. Instead of this piece of garbage, I recommend to you, the Bill Murray comedy Scrooged. That at least, was funny...",
    "When will the hurting stop? I never want to see another version of a Christmas Carol again. They keep on making movies with the same story, falling over each other in trying to make the movie better then the rest, but sadly fail to do so, as this is not a good story. Moralistic, old-fashioned, conservative happy-thinking. As if people learn. The numerous different versions of this film prove that we don´t.",
    "It was 9:30 PM last night at my friend's camping trailer and we were so hyped to watch South Park (a new episode). The thing is, in my country, South Park airs at 10:30 PM and we decided to kill time by watching the show now airing, Father of the Pride. I'll start by saying that I have only watched to episodes. The first time I watched it, I found it unfunny and crude for nothing, so I thought ''Holy sh*t, I have a football game early tomorrow, so I have to stop watching stupid cartoons''. But yesterday, I tried to give Father of the Pride a second chance. I find that it's a complete rip-off of The Simpsons, only replacing yellow human characters by lions instead.<br /><br />The second thing is I wonder why it got it's TV-14 rating. I find The Simpsons a lot more vulgar, and the only real vulgarity in this show is a few homosexual (unfunny) jokes. The Simpsons is also a lot more violent (Halloween specials) and crude. I also heard that the creator of the series has also directed Shrek 2, well I've got news for him: Shrek 2 was way better and I think he stayed too much in the family thematic. However, I must admit that Father of the Pride did make me smile (even burst out laughing once) three or four times.<br /><br />All in all, I don't mind Father of the Pride. I don't hate it, but I don't like either. I've seen way better from ''The Simpsons''.<br /><br />3.5/10",
    "This is blatantly a futuristic adaptation of Jules Verne's \"Mysterious Island\". The sound editing is pretty bad. You hear the dialogue on set and you hear the voices being recorded on a recording booth at the same time! This is an amateur film with actors from Boston and shot around New Hampshire. For those living in New Engalnd and who is reading this comment will be wowed with a capital W. This film is full of flaws. You get to hear the director's voice giving directions and giving out directions to the actress. \"OK now stand up.\" As for the other characters. There is this guy who talks with his mind instead of his voice and this blue alien. The alien guy talks with a deep voice. When he is yawning or grunting when he is fighting you hear the actor's voice. As for the special effects, man! This was Brett Piper's early work for crying out loud! The creatures are good but the animation is jerky. Really jerky. Sort of like Karl Zeman animation in JOURNEY TO BEGINNING OF TIME (1955). The special effects are imaginative. Thge music is good. Bottom line, this film makes EQUINOX or PLANET OF THE DINOSAURS look like a Ray Harryhausen epic. Did you know MYSTERIOUS PLANET was a home movie and was on a shoes string budget? A must watch for aspiring film makers.",
    "Beyond a shadow of a doubt Mysterious Planet is one of the worst movies ever made, yet retains an affection in my heart because the poverty of its special effects and astoundingly awful sound track in the first 15 minutes (and to be honest that's all you need to see) combine to create something that is hilariously side-splitting.<br /><br />The opening scene in 'space' is just about as unfathomable as cinematography gets, as washing-up liquid bottles whiz past your eyes to muffled dialogue. Before you've had time to work out whether it's you who's gone mad, the credits roll and the action struggles to life.<br /><br />And aside from the double-headed plasticine giant snail that terrorises our heroes, you also get the added double bonus of having both the original actors voices AND the dubbed voices at the same time. Pure genius.<br /><br />The sad thing for fans of this kind of fare is that I've only ever seen one copy, so the chances of ever seeing it yourself is highly unlikely. Perhaps I own the only copy in existence.<br /><br />",
    "The silent one-panel cartoon Henry comes to Fleischer Studios, billed as \"The world's funniest human\" in this dull little cartoon. Betty, long past her prime, thanks to the Production Code, is running a pet shop and leaves Henry in charge for far too long -- five minutes. A bore.",
    "William Russ is the main character throughout this made for TV movie. He left his family behind to only reappear and begin paying off his debts. But he tries to keep away from his family. Thats where Peter Falk (Colombo) comes in, playing several different roles, to convince him to come home.<br /><br />The story is average and they actually managed to get a former star (Peter Falk) and use him to a fairly nice degree. But William Russ wasn't truly a star. However, it appears his acting is still OK.<br /><br />I found the delivery and story very cheesy in how everything was predictable. In fact, the last 20 minutes I could almost dictate word for word before it happened. A good movie should never be like that.<br /><br />Overall, it was a sub-par movie. In a letter grading system, it would receive a \"D\".",
    "From a poorly contrived plot line that makes almost no sense to bad dialogue and disjointed scenes to the ultimate downer, bad acting (even Peter Falk can't find his way) \"Finding John Christmas\" is better left lost. Ms. Bertinelli's performance is without depth or emotion as are her co-stars, William Russ as brother Hank and David Cubitt as love interest Noah. Jennifer Pisana as Soccoro, the daughter of single dad Noah is almost unbearable to watch let alone listen to singing. But who can blame them with material like this. Michael J. Murray's script is juvenile at best. <br /><br />Each year at this time I search the TV guides and wait anxiously for some of the really classic Christmas and inspirational holiday films to appear on the small screen. Films like \"Miracle on 34th Street\", Ernst Lubitsch's delightful \"The shop around the corner\" and, of course the 1951 version of \"Scrooge\". There's Frank Capra's classics \"It's a wonderful life\" and \"Meet John Doe\". Hey, forget the classics. What about \"Home Alone\" or \" Home for the Holidays\" with Holly Hunter and a great performance by Robert Downey Jr.? <br /><br />My present to you is by way of advice. Your time would be better spent searching out these films than finding \"Finding John Christmas\". Merry Christmas!",
    "I never like to comment on a good film but when it comes to a bad movie, I gotta come really hard on it. Talking about Vivah, this guy, Sooraj Badjatya, seems to have completely lost it. After success of Hum Aapke Hain Kaun, he thought he can make money with cheesy wedding videos. Vivah is so so cheesy that Badjatyas have left Johars and Chopras behind.<br /><br />There was not a single moment during the movie where I can say 'Oh! at least this thing is good'. Aloknath does cliché in a role of Girl's father, Shahid kapoor looks fat and Shahrukhed, Amrita rao is another disaster in addition to ugly looking sets, bad costumes, hackneyed storyline, monstrous stepmother, trying-hard-to-act actors, cacophonous background music, cheap soundtracks.<br /><br />Now the spoiler, I'm warning you guys that as happens in all his other movies, after a calamitous incidence movie ends on a happy note.",
    "I won't say this movie was bad, but it wasn't good either. I expected something good but I guess Hum Aapke Hain Kaun was much better than this. This was completely old fashioned. At every stage of this movie, I hoped for some twist and what do I get? The girl gets burned and wins her aunt's love. <br /><br />Despite of being engaged, they have to take permission for every little move they make. They are so darn shy even after so many meetings. I expected the aunt to be much more brutal than that. All she did was crib madly. <br /><br />Hey, we have kids too, but we don't watch them and have tears in our eyes always. This movie is a dream. Happy family, one cruel woman, good in-laws and a man who loves her to death. In HAHK Anupam Kher was the poor bride's father and now it's vice versa. And I somehow knew that Mohnish Behl would be in this movie. Anyway I believe I wasted my time. I give it a 2/10.",

Wake up people!<br /><br />Four out of the five people that saw the film with me would not recommend the film. We had a great time bashing majority of the unrealistic scenes.

I was hugely disappointed. It is a script reading not a film, vulgar for the sake of being vulgar, bankrupt in every way that \"The Tailor of Panama\" is rich and satisfying. Blame it on the screen writing and directing. I sat in the theater waiting for the \"good part;\" it never came. I neither laughed nor cried, although one line of dialog did make me smile. Worth $7?

    "I very nearly walked out, but I'd paid my money, and my nearly-as-disgusted friend wanted to hold out. After the endearing, wide-eyed innocence of \"A New Hope\" and the thrilling sophistication of \"The Empire Strikes Back,\" I remember awaiting \"Return of the Jedi\" with almost aching anticipation. But from the opening scene of this insultingly commercial sewage, I was bitterly disappointed, and enraged at Lucas. He should have been ashamed of himself, but this abomination undeniably proves that he doesn't have subatomic particle of shame in his cold, greedy heart. Episode I would go on to reinforce this fact -- your honor, I call Jarjar Binks (but please issue barf bags to the members of the jury first).<br /><br />From the initial raising of the gate at Jabba's lair, this \"film\" was nothing more than a two-plus-hour commercial for as many licensable, profit-making action figures as Lucas could cram into it -- the pig-like guards, the hokey flesh-pigtailed flunky, that vile muppet-pet of Jabba's, the new and recycled cabaret figures, the monsters, etc., etc., ad vomitum. Then there were the detestably cute and marketable Ewoks. Pile on top of that all of the rebel alliance aliens. Fifteen seconds each on-screen (or less) and the kiddies just GOTTA have one for their collection. The blatant, exploitative financial baiting of children is nauseating.<br /><br />Lucas didn't even bother to come up with a new plot -- he just exhumed the Death Star from \"A New Hope\" and heaved in a boatload of cheap sentiment. What an appalling slap in the face to his fans. I can't shake the notion that Lucas took a perverse pleasure in inflicting this dreck on his fans: \"I've got these lemmings hooked so bad that I can crank out the worst piece of stinking, putrid garbage that I could dream up, and they'll flock to the theaters to scarf it up. Plus, all the kiddies will whine and torture their parents until they buy the brats a complete collection of action figures of every single incidental undeveloped, cartoonish caricature that I stuffed in, and I get a cut from every single one. It'll make me even more obscenely rich.\"<br /><br />There may have been a paltry, partial handful of redeeming moments in this miserable rip-off. I seem to recall that Harrison Ford managed to just barely keep his nose above the surface of this cesspool. But whatever tiny few bright spots there may be are massively obliterated by the offensive commercialism that Lucas so avariciously embraced in this total, absolute sell-out to profit.",
    "The fine cast cannot uplift this routine tale of a secretary murdered by her married paramour. In fact there are more questions than answers in this one-sided tale of romance and murder; and since we are only provided with the prosecution's side, none of these questions will be answered. This is the type of fare that appeals to the \"He Woman, Man Hater\" clubs of America. As presented, it is the tale of an innocent woman who just happens to be \"caught up\" in a romance with a married, high-profile attorney. Is it possible that IF, she had not been two timing her boy friend and having an affair with a married man, the whole nasty murderous, sordid incident could have been avoided? When you watch this, don't worry about going to the 'fridge, you won't miss anything.",
    "This film was choppy, incoherent and contrived. It was also an extremely mean-spirited portrayal of women. I rented it because it was listed as a comedy (that's a stretch), and because the cover said Andie McDowell was acting up a storm in it. She wasn't. I'm a gal, I watched this film with two guys, and we spent an hour afterwards exclaiming over how bad it was.<br /><br />WARNING: PLOT SUMMARY BELOW! RAMPANT SPOILERS!<br /><br />The movie starts out with a fairly hackneyed plot about an older woman who takes up with a younger man, to the severe disapproval of her two jealous single girlfriends. They want her to marry a boring guy their own age who is kind of in love with her. But she's so happy with her oversexed puppy that you're rooting for them to stick it out, and sure enough, she decides to marry the guy. But her harpy girlfriend, aided by the wishy-washy one, sets up a plot to trick our heroine into thinking the guy is cheating on her. It works. She has a fight with him, he runs out of the house and is crushed by a truck (Remember the movie's title?) So now he's dead, two-thirds of the way through the film. And although our heroine is a school headmistress who spends her time watching over girls, she apparently forgot to use birth control and is pregnant.<br /><br />She's already broken off relations with her girlfriends, because they were so unsupportive. Alone and pitiful, she decides to marry the boring guy. Did I mention that the boring guy who kind of loves her is a minister? She had asked him to marry her to the young guy (nice, huh?), but now she tells him she'll marry him, and apparently he has no objections to being dicked around in this fashion. But her girlfriends rescue her at the altar and take her home, where they not-quite-confess that they were mostly responsible for the love of her life getting smushed. She has the kid. In the final scene, they leave it in a crib inside her house while they go out on the porch to drink, smoke and be smug. I kid you not, it's that bad. I left out the part about the cancer red-herring and the harpy's ridiculous lesbian moment."

    "This film, while an interesting experiment, ultimately fails to tell a compelling story.  Though it touches upon numerous important issues, it does so without clear intention, leaving the viewer with no fresh insights.  The experience feels more like an endurance test than a thought-provoking journey, leaving one's mind to wander aimlessly.  Frankly, you'd gain more from observing a tree grow than enduring this pointless film. \n",
    "This film's screenplay reads like a slapdash attempt to capture Lucille Ball's essence, utterly divorced from the truth of her life story.  As someone familiar with her autobiography and the indelible mark she left on entertainment, I was aghast at the sheer volume of inaccuracies. From her formative years in Celoron and Jamestown, where the filmmakers seemed to invent their own geography, to the tumultuous yet passionate years spent with Desi, the film stumbles through a minefield of factual errors.  Honestly, I could pen an entire dissertation dissecting each misstep, but suffice it to say, the inaccuracies are as numerous as stars in the Hollywood sky.\n\nLucille Ball, with her incandescent talent and unparalleled comedic timing, is simply irreplaceable.  If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi Jr., I'd be fuming. This film, despite any good intentions, feels like a clumsy caricature of their mother's legacy, leaving a bitter aftertaste of disappointment. \n",
    "My jaw dropped the moment Rachel York appeared on screen as Lucille Ball.  To call it a misfire would be an understatement of epic proportions. Lucille Ball, a comedic force of nature with a talent as bright as the Hollywood sign, is reduced to a pale imitation in York's hands. How, in a world brimming with talented actresses, did the producers settle on this? While York might shine in other roles, she's utterly out of her depth attempting to embody the iconic Lucy.  It's true that capturing  Lucille Ball's unique blend of physical comedy, sharp wit, and undeniable charisma is a herculean task, but surely they could have found someone who at least resembled her, both physically and in terms of talent! York's rendition of classic \"I Love Lucy\" scenes, like the chocolate factory or the Vitameatavegamin commercial, are devoid of Lucy's signature expressions, vocal inflections, and physicality.  It's almost painful to watch.\n\nAnd if York's Lucy falls flat, Danny Pino's Desi Arnaz crashes and burns.  Pino simply doesn't have the presence or the physique to portray the charismatic bandleader. His accent is laughably off, and his performance lacks the charm and simmering energy that Desi exuded. While the actors playing Fred and Ethel are also miscast, their performances don't inspire the same level of disbelief. \n\nThis film is a masterclass in how not to cast a biopic. The miscasting, coupled with a poorly constructed narrative, makes for a truly dreadful viewing experience.  If you truly want to understand the brilliance and complexity of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, skip this film entirely.  Instead, delve into the A&E Biography, read Lucy's autobiography, or watch PBS's \"American Masters: Finding Lucy.\"  For a more accurate and compelling dramatization, seek out \"Before the Laughter,\" which, while not perfect, at least captures a glimmer of the real Lucy and Desi. \n",
    "\"They\" - ah, there's the rub! The culprits in this cinematic free-for-all seem to be everyone involved except the poor audience subjected to the results.  The air practically crackles with an \"aren't-we-having-fun-making-a-MOVIE\" vibe, the kind that usually translates to a painful viewing experience. \n\nRitter, with those spectacles perched on his nose, feels less like a character and more like a clunky imitation of Bogdanovich himself.  His scenes with Stratten, while admittedly sweet, have an awkward, adolescent energy, as if they're teenagers showing off their prom date. Ben Gazzara, usually a captivating presence, resorts to his trademark sly grin in a desperate attempt to inject life into the paper-thin plot. Watching him pursue Audrey Hepburn (playing a version of herself, no less) is like witnessing a sloth attempt a sprint. And then there are the children (Bogdanovich's own daughters, in a move reeking of nepotism) who flit about spouting precocious dialogue and gleaning questionable lessons in love. Bless Audrey Hepburn for maintaining her dignity amidst the chaos.  \n\nVisually, everyone looks fantastic, but who cares? That's the bare minimum we expect from a film. If I wanted to see beautiful people, I'd flip through a fashion magazine. And speaking of things that grate on the nerves, Colleen Camp's performance is...a choice. Her singing, while technically proficient, feels jarringly out of place. The country-western tunes clash with the rest of the soundtrack, like a polka band at a funeral. Gershwin, whose music inspired the film's title, must be spinning in his grave.  \n\nThe tragic shadow of Dorothy Stratten's fate hangs heavy over the film. Bogdanovich's personal connection to the project is undeniable – he even went bankrupt trying to make it a success. While it's difficult to criticize a film born from such heartfelt passion, \"They All Laughed\" is a pale imitation of Bogdanovich's earlier triumphs like \"The Last Picture Show\" and \"Paper Moon.\" It serves as a painful reminder of a career that took a downward turn.\n\n\"They All Laughed\" is ultimately harmless, but utterly skippable.  Life is too short for mediocre movies. I'll get my fill of genuine joy and love from the masters like Lubitsch and Demy. \n",
    "\"They All Laughed\" is indeed a personal film for Peter Bogdanovich, drawing inspiration from his own life while transposing the story onto a group of detectives.  This narrative choice, however, creates a jarring disconnect between the characters' professions and their lifestyles. These detectives, who effortlessly attract and date stunning models, feel more like projections of a Hollywood fantasy than believable figures grounded in reality. \n\nThe screenplay, penned entirely by Bogdanovich, exposes a certain detachment from the experiences of everyday people. While the \"write what you know\" adage holds merit, in this instance, it results in a film that feels both insular and inaccessible. The audience is left struggling to connect with characters leading lives far removed from their own.\n\nThe presence of Dorothy Stratten, tragically murdered shortly after filming, adds a layer of somber curiosity to the film. However, it's her co-star, Patti Hansen, who commands more screen time and delivers a more captivating performance. Stratten's role, in contrast, feels somewhat tangential, lacking a strong connection to the already convoluted plot. \n\nUltimately, \"They All Laughed\" suffers from a lack of relatable characters and situations. The film's depiction of wealth, privilege, and easy romance within the elite circles of Manhattan may resonate with a select few, but for most viewers, it rings hollow and induces more yawns than gasps. This disconnect between filmmaker and audience serves as a reminder that even the most personal of stories benefit from a degree of universality to truly resonate. \n",
    "I'm baffled by the praise heaped upon this film. It's not just bad; it's bafflingly pointless. While the actors and crew demonstrate technical competence, they're working with a script so weak it borders on non-existent. Even a stellar cast and crew can't spin gold from straw. \n\nFans of Ben Gazzara, spare yourselves the pain and seek out his other, far superior work. Dorothy Stratten devotees, stick to \"Galaxina.\" And for those who appreciate Peter Bogdanovich at his best, \"The Last Picture Show\" and \"Targets\" are far worthier uses of your time. \n\nIf, however, you find yourself inexplicably drawn to this film, perhaps seeking a few cheap laughs at the expense of its creators, I'd suggest reading Bogdanovich's \"Killing of the Unicorn\" instead. That book, in all its unintentional hilarity, offers a similar level of entertainment value. \n",
    "This film is a disappointing misfire, especially considering Peter Bogdanovich's track record. Casting models like Dorothy Stratten and Patti Hansen backfires, as they display little acting prowess. Ironically, Bob Fosse's \"Star 80,\" which also revolves around Stratten's tragic story, proves far more compelling than her own presence on screen here.\n\nInstead of a rediscovered masterpiece reminiscent of Orson Welles, we're subjected to Audrey Hepburn sporting an unfortunate poodle-like hairstyle and trying her best to pull off a casual jeans look. The end result is jarring and falls flat. \n\nWhile \"Paper Moon\" and \"The Last Picture Show\" stand as testaments to Bogdanovich's filmmaking talent, this film is a slog to endure even once.  Though rumors blamed its lackluster release on the controversy surrounding Stratten's death, the truth is likely far simpler: it's just not a good movie. \n",
    "This film's shortcomings have nothing to do with the talented cast or the captivating New York City setting, which the director clearly adores.  Even Woody Allen, known for his love affairs with Manhattan, couldn't have improved upon its charm. \n\nThe real problem lies in the lack of a substantial script.  Characters fall in love instantly, rendering dialogue almost irrelevant. While the director seemingly draws from his own experiences in Hollywood, where love at first sight might be a common occurrence, for the average viewer, it feels unrealistic and unearned.\n\nThis disconnect between the filmmaker's reality and the audience's expectations ultimately leaves the film feeling hollow, superficial, and lacking a meaningful message. \n",
    "Today, while scouring the dusty shelves of a video rental store, I stumbled upon a forgotten gem—at least, that's what I thought it was.  The VHS for \"They All Laughed\" was practically begging to be rescued, its worn case hinting at countless viewings.  The names on the cover practically jumped out at me: Peter Bogdanovich, Audrey Hepburn, John Ritter, and the intriguing Dorothy Stratten. With such a cast and a bargain-bin price, how could I resist?\n\nMy excitement grew when I saw its respectable 6.0 rating on IMDb and – wait for it – a four-star review in \"Mick Martin & Marsha Porter's Video & DVD Guide.\" This, I convinced myself, was a hidden treasure!\n\nFast forward to now, and let's just say my expectations have been…adjusted. Instead of the cinematic delight I anticipated, I found myself struggling to stay engaged.  The characters felt like rough sketches, their motivations murky at best. And the humor?  Let's just say the only laughter came from my own incredulity at the absurd coincidences and the sight of Ben Gazzara as an irresistible lothario.  Even in a city known for its romantic possibilities, it was a stretch.\n\nWhat ultimately saves the film from complete disaster is its curious cast of characters. Seeing Dorothy Stratten, whose tragic story would later be told in films like \"Star 80,\" adds a layer of poignancy. Then there's the undeniable allure of  Patti Hansen, the future Mrs. Keith Richards, who lights up the screen. And of course, the ever-luminous Audrey Hepburn, proving that age is no match for elegance. \n\nSo, will I be adding \"They All Laughed\" to my list of all-time favorites?  Not quite.  But it's earned a permanent spot on my shelf, a reminder that even the most promising discoveries can sometimes lead to unexpected destinations. \n",
    "\"They All Laughed\" isn't just a bad film; it's a cinematic train wreck of epic proportions, a symphony of awkward acting, technical blunders, and narrative dead ends. Picture this: John Ritter resorting to pratfalls like a vaudeville clown, three-quarters of the cast delivering lines with the passionless cadence of a robot reciting a grocery list, and editing so choppy it'll give you motion sickness.  \n\nAnd the sound mixing!  Prepare to strain your ears as crucial dialogue drowns beneath a cacophony of background noise, leaving you to decipher the plot through a muffled haze. Speaking of the plot, imagine a hamster on a wheel – going nowhere fast.\n\nAstonishingly, amidst this maelstrom of cinematic incompetence, Dorothy Stratten doesn't claim the title of \"Worst Performance.\" That dubious honor goes to a trio of actors who redefine \"wooden acting,\" with Patti Hansen leading the pack, her monotone delivery suggesting an existential crisis unfolding beneath the surface.  Even Bogdanovich's own children, roped into this fiasco, deliver cringeworthy performances, their discomfort radiating through the screen. \n\nThis film isn't just bad; it's a blight on cinema.  Do yourself a favor and steer clear. Consider this review a public service announcement, a warning to protect your sanity and your love of film. Watching \"They All Laughed\" again would be akin to self-inflicted torture, a fate I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy.  Let's just call it a \"Suckotrocity\" and leave it at that. \n",
    "I got this movie because I was curious about Dorothy Stratten. Even though it had some famous actors, the story was super confusing! It was like they were trying to do too many things at once, and it just didn't make much sense.  The talking parts felt weird and unnatural, and the whole thing was kind of boring.\n\nI was sad because it was one of Audrey Hepburn's last movies, and I really like her.  John Ritter is hilarious when he's being goofy, but he seemed sad in this one. \n",
    "Hey, sometimes a bad movie can be inspiring! It makes you think, \"If they can get a film made, maybe I can too!\"  This particular movie might not be winning any awards, but it's a good reminder that filmmaking is a challenging craft, and not every attempt is going to be a masterpiece. So, keep dreaming big, hone your skills, and maybe someday, we'll be watching your awesome film! \n",
    "It's clear that the team behind \"Zombie Chronicles\" poured their hearts into this project, and that deserves acknowledgement.  Indie filmmaking is a challenging journey, and passion can only take you so far.  However, a few constructive critiques might help them on their next venture:\n\nFirstly,  the opening credits sequence, while likely intended to create intrigue, inadvertently reveals key plot points, particularly regarding character deaths. For a film relying on surprise twists, this could be easily adjusted in post-production.\n\nSecondly, while the limitations of a low budget are understandable, securing even a few experienced actors can elevate a film significantly.  Performances, particularly from Joe Haggerty, could benefit from additional guidance or casting choices.\n\nThirdly, period-piece scenes require attention to detail. If authentic props and costumes are unavailable, perhaps those scenes could be reimagined within the film's primary time period.\n\nLastly,  the effectiveness of a twist ending hinges on its unpredictability.  While clarity is essential,  \"Zombie Chronicles\" might benefit from a more subtle approach to foreshadowing, allowing the audience to experience genuine surprise.\n\nThe creators' enthusiasm is admirable, but  \"Zombie Chronicles,\" in its current form, might only appeal to the most dedicated zombie film completists. With a few tweaks, their next project could truly shine. \n",
    " Brace yourself for \"Zombie Chronicles,\" a film that mistakes 3D gore for genuine thrills.  Imagine, if you will, zombies munching on human body parts in all their three-dimensional glory!  Groundbreaking, right? Not so much. \n\nWhile the filmmakers seem to think they've stumbled upon a cinematic goldmine by presenting tired zombie tropes in 3D, they've overlooked the key ingredient that elevates the genre: a compelling story.  Those classic zombie flicks we all know and love?  They understood that the true horror lies in the human drama, the unraveling of society, with flesh-eating as a gruesome side dish.  \n\n\"Zombie Chronicles\" serves up a bland buffet of predictable \"Twilight Zone\"-esque vignettes, each more tedious than the last. And just when you think it can't get any worse, the film circles back to its starting point, as if trying to convince us we've witnessed something profound. \n\nSave your popcorn—and your sanity—and stick to the zombie classics. This 3D snoozefest is best left forgotten. \n",
    "\"The Zombie Chronicles\" aspires to be a chilling anthology film, but with its meager offering of just two short stories, it stumbles right out of the gate.  A reporter, venturing towards a remote town, encounters a peculiar hitchhiker who treats her to a pair of gruesome tales.  \n\nUnfortunately, the film's shortcomings extend far beyond its limited scope.  The acting is uniformly dreadful, the settings are uninspired, and the script reads like a first draft desperately in need of a rewrite.  Even a sex scene devoid of any nudity feels like a missed opportunity. And the ending?  Let's just say it's best described as bewildering. \n\nWhile the director attempts some creative camerawork, and the gore effects are enthusiastically applied,  \"The Zombie Chronicles\" remains a slog to endure, even for seasoned fans of low-budget horror.  It's a film that mistakes blood and guts for genuine scares, leaving the viewer feeling cheated rather than entertained.  \n\n\n",
    "\"The Zombie Chronicles\"... where do I even begin?  Let's just say this film has achieved legendary status in my household, though perhaps not in the way its creators intended.  It's a testament to the power of cinema to inspire, not necessarily with artistry, but with the sheer audacity of its existence. \n\nThis film sparked a level of creativity within me that I never knew existed. As I sat through scenes of unparalleled awkwardness and unintentional hilarity, my mind raced with possibilities—anything but enduring another minute of this cinematic odyssey.  Suddenly, filing my taxes seemed like a delightful alternative, even engaging in a Civil War reenactment held a certain allure!\n\nBut amidst the laughter and the head-shaking,  \"The Zombie Chronicles\" imparted a valuable lesson:  we all have stories to tell.  So, go forth, aspiring filmmakers, and embrace your creativity!  You might not achieve cinematic perfection, but you just might inspire someone to clean their bathroom instead of watching your film, and that's a victory in its own right.  Just maybe leave the bleach-drinking and Owen Wilson out of your promotional materials. \n",
    "While far from a cinematic masterpiece,  \"The Zombie Chronicles\" offers a certain so-bad-it's-good charm. The storyline is laughably awful, and the acting, particularly from the character Jebidia (who deserves an award for his unique brand of entertainment), will have you howling with laughter.  However, if you're seeking genuine thrills or a coherent plot, steer clear.  This one's strictly for fans of unintentional comedy. \n",
    "This ain't no hidden gem, folks.  While some budget-priced DVDs offer a gateway to cinematic delights, \"The Zombie Chronicles\" lands squarely in the bargain bin of cinematic misfires.  Think of it as the cinematic equivalent of finding a moldy sandwich at the back of your fridge—you might be curious for a second, but one whiff will send you running.\n\nThis clumsy anthology film feels like it was cobbled together with the technical prowess of a drunken seagull attempting brain surgery.  The opening credits, inexplicably featuring spoilers of the film's supposed \"money shots,\" are a harbinger of the disaster to come. \n\nAnd the acting!  Prepare yourself for performances so wooden, they could be used to build a treehouse. The hitchhiker, bless his heart, delivers a masterclass in unintentional comedy, his every line reading a symphony of awkward pauses and misplaced inflections.  Even the film's print quality adds to the ambiance of cinematic despair—grainy, washed out, and about as visually appealing as a dumpster fire viewed through a kaleidoscope.\n\n\"The Zombie Chronicles\" is a testament to the fact that sometimes, it's best to let sleeping dogs lie.  Those childhood home videos you've stashed away in the attic? Yeah, this film makes them look like Oscar-worthy productions. Avoid at all costs. \n",
    "This movie, my friends, is a gift that keeps on giving... headaches, that is.  I knew from the DVD cover that I was in for a wild ride, but nothing could have prepared me for the cinematic odyssey that is \"The Zombie Chronicles.\"\n\nLet's just say the budget for this film probably wouldn't cover your weekly grocery bill. Imagine a group of friends, armed with a camcorder and a script seemingly fueled by late-night pizza and questionable life choices, deciding to make a zombie movie. \n\nThe plot, if you can call it that, revolves around a reporter who accidentally (maybe?) runs over a \"drunk\" guy.  Instead of, you know, calling for help, they end up in a conveniently furnished abandoned house, where the not-so-drunk fellow decides to share some truly bizarre zombie tales. \n\nBuckle up for stories of inept soldiers, vengeful lovers, and zombies rising from their graves for reasons that defy all logic and good taste.  The twist ending, much like the rest of the film,  will leave you scratching your head and wondering if you accidentally stumbled into a fever dream.\n\nConsider this your official warning:  Even the most die-hard fans of B-horror movies should approach this one with caution. You've been warned! \n",
    "\"The Zombie Chronicles\" exemplifies the pitfalls of extremely low-budget filmmaking.  The film suffers from a poorly constructed narrative, amateurish acting, and questionable directorial choices. \n\nThe lead actor's performance is particularly jarring, lacking the pacing and inflection of natural speech.  The supporting cast fares no better, delivering lines with an awkward stiffness that further detracts from the viewing experience. \n\nWhile the makeup effects demonstrate a degree of competence, any potential impact is undermined by the ill-conceived decision to showcase key scenes during the opening credits sequence. This baffling choice effectively spoils any sense of suspense or surprise for the viewer.\n\nOverall,  \"The Zombie Chronicles\" fails to engage on even a basic level. Its numerous flaws overshadow any glimmers of potential, resulting in a film that is best avoided. \n",
    "One has to admire Brad Sykes's sheer tenacity. Despite a string of low-budget horror films met with lukewarm reception, he persists, churning out films with an almost admirable stubbornness.  Even the faint praise occasionally directed at his \"Camp Blood\" series feels more like a polite nod than genuine enthusiasm.  \n\nSykes's films often hint at untapped potential—a clever concept here, an intriguing character there—but ultimately fall victim to their limited resources. He seems to operate on the hope that audiences will overlook the rough edges, appreciating the ambition rather than the execution.\n\nIn \"The Zombie Chronicles,\"  Joe Haggerty's performance as Ebenezer Jackson injects a much-needed dose of energy and offbeat humor. It's a testament to Sykes's directorial instincts that he recognizes and utilizes Haggerty's eccentricities to elevate the film, however slightly. \n\nWhile  \"The Zombie Chronicles\" might not be gracing multiplex screens anytime soon (unless those screens exist in a parallel universe with significantly lower cinematic standards),  it showcases Sykes's unwavering commitment to his craft, even if that craft sometimes resembles a Frankensteinian monster cobbled together from spare parts. \n",
    "My heart sank as I finally watched \"Love's Abiding Joy.\"  I'd waited so long for this film,  eager to revisit the world of Janette Oke's heartwarming stories. What I experienced, however, felt like a pale imitation, shrouded in a pervasive sadness that permeated every scene.\n\nThe story felt disjointed, the editing jarring, as if crucial moments were left on the cutting room floor. Baby Kathy's death, a gut-wrenching event, arrived too abruptly, leaving Missie and Willie's grief frustratingly unexplored. Even Clark's presence, while welcome, felt strangely out of place, his character lacking the depth and warmth he possessed in the book.\n\nThe magic of Oke's storytelling lies in the small moments, the tender exchanges between characters, the way they support each other through trials and tribulations. \"Love's Abiding Joy\" misses that mark, the emotional core of the story feeling hollowed out.  \n\nThe omission of key plot points, like the mine accident and its impact on the family, further distances the film from its source material.  It's disheartening to see these adaptations stray so far from the essence of Oke's beloved books.\n\nI hold out hope that future installments will recapture the spirit of the series,  delving deeper into character development and honoring the storylines that captivated readers.  Give us more Scottie and Cookie,  a more impactful role for Clark, and above all,  return the warmth and heart to this cherished frontier saga. \n",
    "It's understandable to feel disappointed when a film adaptation doesn't capture the essence of the book you love.  \"Love's Abiding Joy,\" while aiming to continue the spirit of Janette Oke's series,  takes creative liberties that might leave some viewers feeling lost. \n\nIt's true that the film deviates significantly from the specific storylines and character details found in the book of the same name.  However, perhaps it can be seen as a tribute to the overall themes and spirit of Oke's work, rather than a strict adaptation of a single narrative. \n\nThe filmmakers have chosen to explore new territory within the familiar world Oke created,  introducing fresh challenges and triumphs for the characters.  While this approach might not resonate with everyone, it opens up possibilities for viewers to experience the frontier saga with fresh eyes. \n\nIf you're seeking a feel-good family film, \"Love's Abiding Joy\" still offers a clean and heartwarming viewing experience.  And who knows,  future installments might delve deeper into the specific storylines readers hold dear.  In the meantime, let's celebrate the enduring appeal of Janette Oke's books and the passion they continue to ignite in readers and viewers alike. \n",
    "While I enjoyed \"Love's Abiding Joy\" as a wholesome family film, its editing significantly detracts from the overall viewing experience.  Numerous scenes feel out of context, disrupting the flow of the story and creating a sense of disjointedness.  \n\nDespite this flaw,  I remain a fan of the series and eagerly anticipate future installments.  The characters of Willie and Missie are genuinely endearing, offering positive role models and a heartwarming love story. \n\nMy hope is that future films in the series will address the editing issues, allowing the strengths of the story and characters to shine through more clearly.  With a bit more care in post-production, these films have the potential to be truly great. \n",
    "Having read all the \"Love Come Softly\" books, I understand that film adaptations require condensing and altering storylines.  However, \"Love's Abiding Joy\" strays so far from its source material that it's barely recognizable.\n\nThe only similarity lies in the appearance of Missie's father, though even that detail is altered from the book. The film's plot is convoluted, unnecessarily bleak, and bears little resemblance to the heartwarming spirit of Oke's novel.  \n\nWhile pioneer life was undoubtedly fraught with challenges, the relentless somber tone becomes tiresome.  Even viewers unfamiliar with the book are likely to find the film excessively depressing.  \n\nDespite its shortcomings, \"Love's Abiding Joy\" at least retains the wholesome family-oriented atmosphere that characterizes the series, which redeems it slightly. \n",
    "It's always a bit disheartening when a film with good intentions falls short of its potential. As someone who appreciates stories with Christian themes, I understand the desire for more movies that explore faith in a genuine and thought-provoking way.\n\nWhile \"Love's Abiding Joy\" might not be the cinematic triumph we're all hoping for, it's important to encourage filmmakers who are passionate about sharing these kinds of stories. The film has its heart in the right place, even if the execution could use some polish. \n\nThe filmmaking team clearly has a desire to create meaningful content, and I'd love to see them continue to grow and develop their craft. Perhaps exploring the works of writers like G.K. Chesterton or C.S. Lewis for inspiration could lead to even more engaging and impactful stories in the future. \n\n\n",
    "\"The Laser Blade\" presents an interesting case of a film with untapped potential.  While the central concept of a light-based weapon is visually intriguing, the execution of the plot leaves much to be desired.\n\nDespite a surprisingly strong cast, the narrative struggles to maintain momentum, often feeling disjointed and lacking a clear direction.  The alien encounter that sets the events in motion is poorly developed, and the protagonist's motivations for embarking on a killing spree remain muddled. \n\nThe film's reliance on the novelty of the light-saber-like weapon overshadows any attempts at character development or meaningful exploration of themes.  Ultimately, \"The Laser Blade\" feels like a missed opportunity, a film that prioritizes flashy visuals over a compelling narrative. \n",
    "\"A Killer Among Us\" lures you in with the promise of a suspenseful thriller: a family terrorized by a stalker amidst a raging storm.  Don't be fooled. This Lifetime movie delivers neither thrills nor chills, opting instead for a tedious melodrama bogged down by unlikeable characters and baffling plot choices.\n\nPrepare yourself for the onslaught of Jill's world, where her teenage daughter Liv treats eye-rolling and backtalk as Olympic sports, and her husband Sean whines and cheats with a face so freckled it could double as a constellation map. When a mysterious hotel bill exposes Sean's infidelity, Jill seeks solace in the arms of the charming, yet oddly aggressive, Richard.  However, her attempt at revenge quickly unravels into a series of frustrating confrontations and baffling inaction. \n\nInstead of a nail-biting climax, we're subjected to a predictable camping trip, where the family's dysfunction reaches new heights of absurdity.  You'll find yourself desperately hoping the storm – which arrives with all the fury of a gentle breeze –  will just wash them all away and put everyone out of their misery. \n\n\"A Killer Among Us\" squanders a promising premise, leaving you with nothing but a profound sense of disappointment and the urge to slap some sense into every character on screen.  Save yourself the agony and skip this one. \n",
    "\"A Killer Among Us\" serves as a stark reminder that even Lifetime, the purveyor of guilty pleasure thrillers, can stumble and fall face-first into a vat of cinematic cheese.  This film is not just predictable; it's a masterclass in squandered potential and cringeworthy execution.\n\nThe plot, a rehashed trope of a family terrorized by a mysterious figure, unfolds with the energy of a snail traversing a salt flat.  The dialogue, seemingly ripped from a daytime soap opera, induces more eye-rolls than gasps. And the acting?  Let's just say the teenage characters deliver performances so wooden, they'd make Pinocchio look like Daniel Day-Lewis.\n\nWhile Lifetime occasionally surprises us with a genuinely gripping thriller,  \"A Killer Among Us\" is a colossal misfire.  It's the kind of film that makes you question the very fabric of reality – why was this made? Who greenlit this project?  How did they manage to assemble a cast seemingly allergic to delivering lines with any semblance of conviction?\n\nSave yourself the two hours you'll never get back.  Instead of enduring this cinematic black hole of entertainment, I recommend engaging in literally any other activity.  Clean your bathroom, organize your sock drawer,  stare blankly at a wall—trust me, it'll be a more fulfilling use of your precious time.  \n\n\n",
    "I'm absolutely baffled! This film, a supposed thriller, sent me spiraling down a rabbit hole of \"what did I just watch?\" moments. The premise, involving a woman who gets psychic visions through touch (with bonus points for repeated touches!),  is about as believable as a unicorn riding a rollercoaster. \n\nDeedee Pfeiffer, bless her heart, delivers a performance so over-the-top, it makes Mount Everest look like an ant hill. Every eye twitch and gasp for air felt like a cry for help,  a desperate attempt to breathe life into a script that should have been left in the depths of a Hollywood reject pile.\n\nTo be fair, the young actress playing Lori managed to emerge from this cinematic wreckage unscathed, even delivering a few genuinely good moments.  But even her talent couldn't salvage this train wreck of a film.\n\nUsually, I'm all for suspending disbelief and embracing the cheesy goodness of a Lifetime movie. But \"Mystery Woman: Vision of a Murder\"  pushed me beyond my limits.  It's a film that will leave you questioning the very nature of reality, and not in a good way.  \n\n\n",
    "While \"The Clocks\" deviates from the original 1950s setting of Agatha Christie's novel, it's a testament to the enduring appeal of the 1930s aesthetic that the filmmakers aimed for a visual style more familiar to fans of the series.  The attention to detail, even extending to repainting a 1950s tube train, highlights their commitment to creating a believable period atmosphere.\n\nThe storyline, centering on the Jarrow March, offers a glimpse into the social and economic realities of the era, prompting reflection on themes of poverty and social consciousness.  While the subplot focusing on Inspector Japp's domestic arrangements might feel like filler, it does provide a touch of humor and a glimpse into the detective's personal life. \n\nPerhaps a tighter focus on either the central mystery or the social commentary would have resulted in a more impactful episode. However, \"The Clocks,\" despite its flaws, remains an entertaining entry in the Poirot canon, showcasing the enduring brilliance of Agatha Christie's storytelling.  \n",
    "Distinguished viewers, it is with a heavy heart that I must address the shortcomings of this particular episode.  While the series as a whole has consistently demonstrated a high degree of quality, this installment falls short of expectations.\n\nThe inclusion of extraneous elements, such as the distracting mouse animation and the ill-fitting lullaby, suggests a lack of focus in the creative process.  These choices, more befitting of a novice filmmaker, detract from the narrative's overall impact.\n\nFurthermore, the pacing feels uneven, with extraneous subplots and unnecessary padding diluting the central narrative. A more judicious editing hand, excising these superfluous elements, would have served the story well.\n\nTherefore, I must, in good conscience, advise those unfamiliar with the series to avoid this episode as a starting point. Its flaws, so evident in comparison to its predecessors, might create an unfair and underwhelming first impression of an otherwise exceptional program. \n",
    "I went into \"Ned Kelly\" with high hopes. A stellar cast and the promise of a definitive portrayal of the Australian icon should have been a winning formula. While Heath Ledger delivers a captivating performance in the lead role, the film ultimately falls short due to a disappointingly thin plot.\n\nDirector Gregor Jordan, who demonstrated his talent in \"Buffalo Soldiers,\" brings a similar level of visual flair and assured direction to \"Ned Kelly.\"  The supporting cast, particularly Joel Edgerton, shines, and the production design beautifully captures the harsh beauty of the Australian bush.\n\nHowever, the film feels like a missed opportunity to delve into the complexities of Ned Kelly's life and legacy. The script, perhaps in an attempt to appeal to a wider audience,  sacrifices depth for a more streamlined, action-oriented approach.  \n\nDespite its flaws, \"Ned Kelly\" is visually stunning and benefits from Ledger's captivating performance.  However, those seeking a nuanced and comprehensive exploration of the man behind the myth might find themselves wanting more.  I suppose I'll be sticking to Peter Carey's \"True History of the Kelly Gang\" for a more satisfying experience. \n",
    "\"Ned Kelly,\" despite its promising subject matter, falls disappointingly flat. The film lacks depth, complexity, and emotional resonance, resulting in a surprisingly dull viewing experience.\n\nWhile the actors deliver competent performances, they are hampered by a pedestrian script devoid of nuance or insight. The film shies away from exploring the multifaceted nature of Ned Kelly, opting instead for a superficial and predictable retelling of his story.\n\nDirector Gregor Jordan's execution lacks the finesse and artistry required to elevate the material beyond its inherent limitations.  The pacing feels uneven, the action sequences lack excitement, and the overall craft feels surprisingly amateurish.\n\nThe enduring fascination with Ned Kelly stems from his enigmatic persona and his representation in the Australian national consciousness. He is a figure of folklore, a symbol of rebellion, and a source of ongoing debate. Regrettably, this film fails to capture the complexities of his story, offering a reductionist and ultimately unsatisfying portrayal.  Once again, the legend of Ned Kelly remains elusive on the big screen. \n",
    "\"Ned Kelly\" sets out to portray the legendary Australian outlaw, a figure often compared to Robin Hood for his defiance of authority. However, the film's historical accuracy is questionable, presenting a romanticized version of events that glosses over the complexities of the era.\n\nBased on the book \"Our Sunshine,\" known for its romanticized portrayal of Kelly, the film adopts a similarly sentimental approach. While it incorporates moments of brutality, the overall tone feels more akin to a historical drama than a gritty portrayal of outlaw life.\n\nThe pacing is undeniably slow, leaving viewers yearning for a narrative spark that never quite ignites. Despite a talented cast, the performances fail to elevate the material.  The exaggerated Irish accents and questionable character portrayals further detract from the film's credibility.\n\nVisually, \"Ned Kelly\" suffers from an overabundance of nature footage, seemingly inserted to pad the runtime and create an illusion of artistry.  The inclusion of non-native animals, such as a lion, in an attempt to heighten the drama feels misplaced and unintentionally comical.\n\nUltimately, \"Ned Kelly\" is a forgettable and uninspired entry in the outlaw genre. Its historical inaccuracies, plodding pace, and uneven performances make it a film best suited for those seeking a highly fictionalized and overly sentimentalized glimpse into Australian history. \n",
    "\"Ned Kelly\" gallops onto the screen with the ambition of blending \"The Man From Snowy River\" with \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,\" adding a dash of romantic intrigue for good measure.  While the legend of Ned Kelly is undoubtedly ripe for cinematic interpretation, this film feels less like a historical drama and more like a melodramatic fairytale loosely inspired by real events.\n\nIt's baffling how a story so recent, a mere blip in historical terms, could be so thoroughly romanticized.  My own grandparents were alive during Kelly's time!  Yet, this film opts for sweeping generalizations and romanticized notions of outlaw life, rather than grappling with the complexities of  19th-century Australia.\n\nPeter Carey's \"True History of the Kelly Gang\" paints a vivid and nuanced portrait of the man and his times. This adaptation, sadly, feels like a pale imitation, lacking the grit, depth, and historical grounding that would make it truly compelling.  \n\nIf you're seeking a historically accurate and insightful portrayal of Ned Kelly, look elsewhere.  However,  if you're simply in the mood for a visually appealing, though ultimately shallow,  period drama,  \"Ned Kelly\" might suffice.  Just be prepared to leave your history books on the shelf. \n",
    "Esteemed audience, while the term \"Australian Western\" might seem geographically incongruous, it aptly describes the cinematic tropes employed in the film \"Ned Kelly.\" This production attempts to elevate Ned Kelly, an infamous Australian outlaw, to the pantheon of folk heroes, drawing parallels to figures like Robin Hood and Jesse James. \n\nThe narrative posits Kelly as a champion of the downtrodden, driven to outlawry by a corrupt system that unjustly imprisons his mother.  His exploits as a bank robber, presented as acts of righteous defiance,  earn him the admiration of the common folk.  \n\nHowever, the film's reliance on well-worn genre clichés undermines its attempt at originality.  We witness Kelly as the noble robber with a heart of gold, displaying acts of calculated generosity designed to solidify his heroic image.  Geoffrey Rush, a consistently brilliant actor, appears confined by the stereotypical role of the relentless lawman.\n\nRegrettably, Heath Ledger's portrayal of Ned Kelly lacks the charisma and depth required to elevate the character beyond a two-dimensional archetype.  The incessant voiceover narration further underscores the film's heavy-handed attempts to romanticize its protagonist.\n\n\"Ned Kelly,\" while offering a glimpse into Australian history, ultimately succumbs to narrative predictability.  It is a film more concerned with reinforcing familiar tropes than offering a fresh perspective on a compelling historical figure. \n",
    "It's clear that \"Ned Kelly\" had all the ingredients for a captivating historical epic, but unfortunately,  the final product falls short of its potential. The filmmakers' ambition is evident, but the execution feels somewhat disjointed.\n\nThe narrative struggles to find its footing, with abrupt emotional shifts and underdeveloped character relationships.  This lack of narrative cohesion prevents the audience from fully connecting with the characters and their struggles.\n\nWhile the acting is commendable, particularly from Heath Ledger and Orlando Bloom, the script lets them down. The dialogue often feels clunky and expository, hindering the actors' ability to fully embody their roles.\n\nIt's understandable why Australians might feel a strong connection to the story of Ned Kelly. However, a film's cultural significance doesn't necessarily translate into cinematic success.  \n\n\"Ned Kelly\" serves as a reminder that even with a fascinating subject and a talented cast,  a film can falter if the writing, directing, and editing aren't firing on all cylinders. \n\n\n",
    "\"Ned Kelly,\" despite boasting a cast overflowing with talent like Orlando Bloom, Heath Ledger, and Geoffrey Rush,  sadly lives up to its straight-to-DVD fate.  Even with such star power, the film fails to ignite,  leaving the viewer more likely to reach for the remote than the edge of their seat.\n\nThe story plods along at a languid pace,  struggling to generate any real engagement or emotional connection.  Characters remain underdeveloped,  their motivations murky and their struggles failing to resonate. \n\nWhile the cast deserves recognition for their efforts, even their collective charisma can't salvage a film this narratively inert.  Even those seeking pure \"eye candy\" entertainment will find themselves disappointed, as the film's lackluster execution extends to its overall visual appeal.  \n\n\n",
    "\"Ned Kelly,\" unfortunately, squanders its potential, delivering a disappointingly flat and uninspired take on a compelling historical tale. While Heath Ledger and Orlando Bloom infuse their characters with commendable effort, the film suffers from a lack of narrative ingenuity and technical finesse.\n\nThe film opens at a languid pace, lacking the dynamism and visual intrigue that could have drawn the audience into the world of 19th-century Australia.  A more dynamic opening sequence, perhaps employing a non-linear narrative or a gripping action set-piece, might have set a more engaging tone.\n\nInstead, the film plods along, each scene unfolding predictably, devoid of suspense or surprise.  The editing lacks rhythm and punch,  while the cinematography feels flat and uninspired.  The overall effect resembles a low-budget television drama, failing to capture the raw energy and epic scope that the story demands.\n\nWhile \"Ned Kelly\" might be a slight improvement over the 1970 Mick Jagger version (a low bar to clear, admittedly), it ultimately disappoints as both a historical drama and a cinematic experience. \n\n\n",
    "\"Ned Kelly,\" despite its promising premise,  fails to do justice to the iconic Australian legend. The film suffers from a jarring disconnect between its ambition and execution, leaving audiences with a diluted and uninspired interpretation of a powerful story.\n\nOne of the most glaring issues is the film's jarring visual aesthetic.  Instead of capturing the rugged beauty and unique character of the Australian outback,  it often resembles a generic American Western,  stripping away the authenticity that should be at the heart of the narrative.\n\nThe decision to portray Ned Kelly with an Irish accent, while historically accurate, feels jarring and misplaced.  While Kelly's heritage is undeniable, his upbringing and life experiences were quintessentially Australian. This creative choice creates a strange dissonance, making it difficult for viewers to fully embrace him as the folk hero he's meant to represent.\n\n\"Ned Kelly\" is a frustrating example of a film that squanders a powerful story through a series of baffling creative decisions. The result is a film that feels both inauthentic and unengaging,  leaving a disappointing aftertaste for anyone hoping to experience the legend of Ned Kelly in all its gritty glory. \n",
    "\"Ned Kelly,\" suffers from a heavy-handed approach to storytelling, sacrificing narrative subtlety and character development in favor of a simplistic and predictable political message.  From the outset,  the film beats the viewer over the head with its agenda,  leaving no room for nuance or interpretation. \n\nThe characters are painted in broad strokes, devoid of the complexities and contradictions that make for compelling storytelling.  The police, portrayed as one-dimensional villains, lack any semblance of humanity or depth,  while Ned Kelly is presented as a faultless folk hero with no opportunity for the audience to question his motivations or actions.\n\nThe film's narrative structure is equally clumsy,  lacking a clear three-act structure or any sense of character arc.  Key events are glossed over, leaving the viewer with a disjointed and ultimately unsatisfying understanding of the story.  \n\n\"Ned Kelly\" serves as a cautionary tale in how not to approach historical filmmaking. By sacrificing narrative integrity for a simplistic political message, the film ultimately undermines its own credibility, leaving the viewer with more questions than answers. \n\n\n",
    "\"Ned Kelly\" tells the story of the legendary Australian outlaw (Heath Ledger) who, after being wrongly accused by a corrupt police force led by Superintendent Francis Hare (Geoffrey Rush), forms a gang to fight back and clear his family's name.\n\nThe film boasts a star-studded cast, including Orlando Bloom, Naomi Watts, and Joel Edgerton, and features some visually striking moments, particularly a climactic gun battle.  However, despite Heath Ledger's strong performance, the narrative failed to capture my full attention, leaving me with a sense of indifference. \n\n\n",
    "\"The Amati Girls\" is certainly a unique film, one that might not resonate with all viewers but possesses a certain quirky charm. While it might rely on some familiar tropes and the acting occasionally veers into over-the-top territory, it's this bold approach that gives the film its memorable quality.\n\nThink of it as a whimsical blend of drama and comedy, with a touch of theatrical flair.  The hair and makeup choices, while unconventional, add to the film's overall aesthetic, creating a heightened sense of reality that some might find endearing.\n\nWhile \"The Amati Girls\"  might not appeal to those seeking a subtle and nuanced cinematic experience, it offers a refreshing departure from the norm.  It's a film that celebrates its own brand of quirky storytelling, leaving a lasting impression. \n",
    "\"Swing!,\" a 1938 film, holds historical significance as a rare surviving example of Black-produced and acted cinema from the 1930s.  It offers a valuable glimpse into the talents of Black performers during this era, often overlooked in mainstream film history.\n\nHowever, the film's historical value is somewhat overshadowed by its numerous technical and narrative flaws. The plot, while mirroring the structure of contemporary Hollywood musicals, is hampered by weak writing and occasionally problematic characterizations.\n\nThe film's portrayal of Black characters, particularly in its early scenes, relies on stereotypes and tropes that many modern viewers will find outdated and potentially offensive.  Additionally, the acting and direction are often amateurish, detracting from the film's overall impact. \n\nDespite its flaws, \"Swing!\" remains a valuable time capsule of Black culture and entertainment from the 1930s.  Its musical performances, featuring exceptional singing and tap dancing, offer glimpses of genuine artistry.  However, viewers should approach the film with an understanding of its historical context and be prepared for a viewing experience that is both fascinating and, at times, cringeworthy. \n",
    "Neil Simon's \"The Sunshine Boys\" is about as cheerful as a rainy day at the cemetery. Don't let the title fool you;  this alleged comedy is a masterclass in curmudgeonly humor and comedic misfires. \n\nWalter Matthau unleashes his inner grump as an aging vaudevillian coaxed into reuniting with his former partner, played by George Burns (who somehow managed to snag an Oscar for this!).  The problem is, Matthau spends the first half-hour of the film single-handedly bludgeoning the audience with his character's abrasive personality, leaving poor George Burns to pick up the pieces when he finally graces us with his presence.\n\nDirector Herbert Ross,  usually a reliable hand behind the camera,  seems lost in this sea of Simon's  uninspired gags.  The pacing is glacial,  the humor more akin to nails on a chalkboard than side-splitting laughter. \n\nEven Matthau,  who could charm the birds out of the trees with that signature gruffness,  feels miscast.  His attempts to embody the physicality of an elderly performer come across as exaggerated and forced. \n\n\"The Sunshine Boys\"  is a film desperately in need of, well, some sunshine. It's a dreary,  unfunny slog that will leave you wondering if someone swapped your comedy for a  geriatric therapy session. \n",
    "Here are the main points of the text, focusing on its central critiques:\n\n* **Disappointing Comedy:** Despite starring Goldie Hawn, \"Protocol\" fails to deliver consistent laughs.\n* **Pacing Issues:**  Some scenes, like the party at a bar, drag on unnecessarily and lack purpose.\n* **Preachy Ending:** The film's ending feels preachy and out of place, leaving a negative impression. \n* **Questionable Value:** Ultimately, the viewer felt the film wasn't worth the purchase price. \n",
    "\"Protocol\" is a cinematic misfire that squanders its promising premise and talented cast on a flimsy and predictable narrative. Goldie Hawn, a comedic force of nature, deserves better than this.\n\nThe film's premise, while initially intriguing, quickly devolves into an implausible and uninspired series of events. The notion that a \"ditzy\" cocktail waitress could stumble her way into saving a foreign dignitary's life and subsequently become a political pawn strains credulity.\n\nHawn, despite her best efforts, can't salvage this sinking ship.  Her signature charm, while present,  is wasted on a script that offers little in the way of witty dialogue or genuinely funny situations.  \n\nUnless you're a die-hard Goldie Hawn completist,  \"Protocol\"  is a film best left unwatched. There are far more deserving comedies out there vying for your attention. \n",
    "Here are the main points from the text, formatted as a bullet list:\n\n* **Executive Producer Role:** The executive producer of a film is often responsible for securing the financial backing for the project.\n* **Sean Connery Example:** Sean Connery frequently served as both star and executive producer of his films, indicating his influence in getting those projects greenlit.\n* **Star Vehicle Warning:**  When the star and executive producer are the same person, it can indicate a \"star vehicle\" project where story and script might be secondary.\n* **\"Protocol\" Case:** Goldie Hawn's role as both star and executive producer of \"Protocol\" suggests the film's quality might be lacking. The text implies that the film's plot, featuring a cocktail waitress turned diplomat, is implausible and likely driven by Hawn's star power. \n",
    "\"Protocol\" definitely takes some wild swings with its outlandish premise, and while it might not hit a home run with everyone, Goldie Hawn's undeniable charm keeps things afloat!   It's a testament to her incredible talent that she can elevate even the most ridiculous storylines with her signature wit and comedic timing. Seriously, the woman is a national treasure! \n\nLet's be honest, we've all seen our fair share of Goldie Hawn movies where the script might not have been Oscar-worthy, but she somehow manages to make them entertaining.  \"Protocol\"  falls into that category – a fun, lighthearted romp that's perfect for a night in when you just need a dose of Goldie's infectious energy. \n",
    "As a student of Catalan, I was eager to immerse myself in \"El Mar,\" a film primarily in the Mallorquín dialect.  While the film boasts stunning visuals and a well-executed, albeit shockingly violent, opening sequence, it ultimately descends into a maelstrom of melodramatic excess and narrative incoherence. \n\nThe film initially evokes comparisons to \"Pan's Labyrinth\" with its evocative portrayal of childhood during the Spanish Civil War.  However, as the narrative jumps forward, focusing on the now-adult characters, \"El Mar\" loses its footing.\n\nThe characters, with the exception of Francisca, are frustratingly underdeveloped and driven by seemingly inexplicable motivations. Their interactions feel disjointed, their dialogue often bordering on nonsensical. \n\nFurthermore, the film revels in graphic violence and suffering, bombarding the viewer with scenes of brutality that feel gratuitous rather than impactful. The overall effect is more akin to a lurid exploitation film than a thoughtful exploration of its themes.\n\nWhile the opening sequence hints at a poignant exploration of childhood trauma and its lasting consequences, \"El Mar\" fails to deliver on its early promise. The lack of narrative development and the overwhelming focus on shock value leave the viewer feeling emotionally drained and narratively unfulfilled.  \n\n\n",
    "\"El Mar,\" a Catalan film entered in the Berlin Film Festival,  attempts to grapple with weighty themes of loss, revenge, and sexuality against the backdrop of the Spanish Civil War.  However, the film's execution ultimately falters, leaving a sense of disappointment and frustration. \n\nDirector Agustí Villaronga bombards the viewer with graphic violence and disturbing imagery, but without sufficient narrative context or emotional depth. While the film aims to explore the horrors of war and their lasting impact on individuals, the relentless bleakness and graphic content become overwhelming and ultimately numbing.\n\nThe film's exploration of homosexuality and religious skepticism,  while potentially intriguing, feels underdeveloped and ultimately lost amidst the excessive violence and melodramatic plot twists. \n\nEven the presence of the talented Angela Molina can't salvage this cinematic misfire. \"El Mar\" ultimately drowns in its own ambition, leaving viewers with a sense of unease rather than a deeper understanding of the complex themes it attempts to address. \n\n\n",
    "\"The Telling,\" a three-part anthology horror film, kicks off with a spooky framing device of a man warning viewers about the dangers lurking outside his boarded-up house. Unfortunately, the three tales he shares deliver a mixed bag of thrills and chills.\n\nThe first story, a short and gruesome tale of a young couple encountering sinister strangers after a car accident, offers a quick dose of violent entertainment. While predictable, its brisk pacing and solid acting keep it engaging.\n\nThe second story, unfortunately, drags its feet.  A man on the run seeks refuge in a creepy clinic, but the tension never quite materializes, despite a decent performance from the lead actor.\n\nThe final installment barely qualifies as horror, focusing on a lonely woman's search for love. While visually appealing with a touch of eroticism, it lacks scares or surprises. \n\nOverall, \"The Telling\" is only worth a partial watch.  Catch the first story for a quick scare, then feel free to switch channels. \n",
    "\"Scorpion Spring\" is a visually striking film, beautifully capturing the landscapes with its cinematography.  However,  it falls short of being truly captivating. The lack of subtitles for crucial Spanish dialogue makes it challenging for non-Spanish speakers to follow the twists and turns of the plot.\n\nWhile marketed as a Matthew McConaughey film, his presence is limited to a brief appearance at the end. Those hoping to enjoy his talent will be disappointed; this is not the film to showcase his acting abilities.\n\nInstead, \"Scorpion Spring\" belongs to its lead actor, Patrick McGaw,  who delivers a charming and engaging performance as a kind-hearted protagonist.  \n\nFans seeking McConaughey's best work should turn to films like \"A Time to Kill,\"  \"The Newton Boys,\" or \"Frailty.\"  While films like \"Larger Than Life\" and \"Angels in the Outfield\" are suitable family entertainment,  they don't represent his full potential.\n\nOverall,  \"Scorpion Spring\" is a visually appealing but narratively flawed film.  It might entertain viewers seeking a visually-driven story, but those wanting substance or a McConaughey-centric experience should look elsewhere. \n",
    "\"Devil Hunter,\" one of Jess Franco's films infamous for landing on the UK's Video Nasty list,  is a tedious jungle exploitation flick that squanders its provocative elements on a dull and poorly executed narrative.\n\nThe story follows a kidnapped movie star (Ursula Buchfellner) who escapes into the clutches of a savage tribe and their \"devil god.\"  Meanwhile, a mercenary (Al Cliver) attempts to rescue her.\n\nFranco's signature filmmaking style, characterized by inept gore, amateurish cinematography, and jarring editing, reaches new lows in \"Devil Hunter.\"  The result is a slog to endure, even for fans of exploitation cinema.  Even Buchfellner's considerable charms can't salvage this cinematic disaster. \n",
    "\"Devil Hunter\" is not your typical horror film.  Prepare yourself, not for spine-tingling terror, but for side-splitting laughter, as this cinematic train wreck careens through a jungle of absurdity and unintended comedy.\n\nThe film's geographical setting is as nebulous as its plot.  Is it South America?  Africa?  A remote island in the Pacific?  Your guess is as good as mine!  And the cannibal tribe?  Imagine, if you will, a random assortment of individuals with zero cultural cohesion, led by a drum-banging Frank Zappa look-alike and a \"devil god\" who seems to have wandered in from a low-budget sci-fi flick. \n\nBut the true highlight of \"Devil Hunter\" lies in its unintentional comedy.  From the over-the-top death scenes to the hilariously bad special effects,  you'll find yourself laughing in disbelief at the sheer audacity of it all.\n\nIf you're looking for a genuinely terrifying horror experience, steer clear.  However, if you're in the mood for a hilariously bad movie night with friends, grab some popcorn (and maybe a stiff drink) and prepare to be entertained by the cinematic disasterpiece that is \"Devil Hunter.\" \n",
    "\"Devil Hunter\" explodes onto the screen with a gloriously ludicrous premise: beautiful film starlet Laura Crawford (Ursula Buchfellner, radiating European glamour) finds herself kidnapped and whisked away to a remote island, caught in a  bizarre game between ransom-hungry criminals and a tribe of cannibalistic natives with a penchant for human sacrifice.\n\nFilmed on the familiar, steamy sets of Franco's other jungle exploitation flicks like \"Cannibals,\"  \"Devil Hunter\" injects a hefty dose of unintentional humor into the mix.  The dubbing is gloriously over-the-top, the dialogue a delightful smorgasbord of non-sequiturs and unintentional puns.  And the monster? Imagine, if you will, a hulking figure with eyes that bulge like ping pong balls (a detail confirmed by Franco himself in the DVD extras!). \n\nFranco assembles a cast of EuroCult favorites, including the stunning Gisela Hahn and Werner Pochath, whose death scene deserves an award for \"Most Bafflingly Miscast Body Double.\" The film doesn't skimp on the nudity,  and the gore, while clearly of the stage blood variety, is applied with enthusiastic abandon. \n\nThe highlight, however, is an epic, slow-motion fistfight between Al Cliver and Antonio de Cabo, set amidst crashing waves. It's a scene so gloriously absurd, it transcends bad filmmaking and becomes a work of art in its own right. \n\nSadly, Franco, in his infinite weirdness,  stretches this 80-minute romp into an almost two-hour endurance test.  The Severin DVD, while generally well-mastered, suffers from occasional ghosting issues and a baffling lack of subtitles for a key Spanish dialogue sequence (unless you opt for the French audio track, for some reason).\n\n\"Devil Hunter\" is a film best enjoyed with a healthy dose of irony and a high tolerance for cinematic chaos.  It's a wild, unpredictable ride into the heart of Franco's unique brand of exploitation filmmaking. \n\n\n",
    "Ladies and gentlemen,  \"Devil Hunter,\" despite its brisk 75-minute runtime, exemplifies a common pitfall of the jungle horror subgenre: an overreliance on tedious footage of characters navigating dense foliage, effectively padding the runtime at the expense of genuine thrills.\n\nHowever,  the film partially redeems itself with its unintentionally comical antagonist—a nude zombie, adorned with comically large, bloodshot eyes and accompanied by an overwrought soundtrack. This ludicrous figure alone might entertain viewers with a taste for camp.\n\nAdditionally,  enthusiasts of European exploitation cinema will find familiar pleasures in the film's poor English dubbing, gratuitous nudity, and unconvincing special effects makeup.  \n\nIt should be noted that \"Devil Hunter\" features surprisingly little gore for a film of its ilk, though this might be attributed to the viewing of a potentially censored version.\n\n\n",
    "\"Ninja Turtles: The Next Mutation\" isn't just a stain on the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' otherwise vibrant shell, it's a cinematic black hole of cringeworthy acting, nonsensical plots, and special effects that would make a preschooler with finger paints scoff.\n\nPicture this: a room full of grown adults dressed as anthropomorphic animals, engaging in dialogue so cheesy it could top a pizza from your worst nightmares. I distinctly remember a scene where a mafia ape (yes, you read that right) educates his goons on the finer points of rhetorical questions.  The memory still makes me question the very fabric of reality.\n\nWhile many fans were turned off by the addition of a female turtle,  Venus de Milo, her existence barely registered on my radar of childhood trauma. The entire series is such a blur of awfulness, it's a testament to the resilience of the human psyche that I've managed to repress most of it.\n\nThe only redeeming quality, a beacon of light in this sewer of despair,  is the catchy theme song.  It's the kind of earworm that burrows into your brain and refuses to leave, a guilty pleasure you hum under your breath while pretending you don't secretly enjoy it. \n\"Nananana ninja...\" Oh, the shame. \n",
    "The introduction of Venus de Milo in \"Ninja Turtles: The Next Mutation\" sparked debate among longtime fans of the franchise. The established dynamic of the four brothers, each named after a Renaissance artist,  held a certain symbolic weight, and the addition of a fifth turtle, especially a female one, felt like a departure from the core concept.\n\nSome argue that Venus's presence disrupts the established brotherly bond and introduces unnecessary complications to the narrative.  The appeal of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,  they argue, lies in the familiar tropes of brotherhood, camaraderie,  and facing off against outlandish villains.\n\nWhile new enemies and challenges are welcomed additions to keep the franchise fresh, altering the fundamental makeup of the team feels, to some,  like a step too far. There's a desire to preserve the essence of what made the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles so captivating in their original incarnation. \n",

    "\"Loaded\" is a visually appealing film that, unfortunately, falls short of its potential due to a weak script and an overabundance of stylistic gimmicks. \n\nWhile the cast, comprised of relative unknowns, delivers commendable performances, they are hampered by a narrative that lacks depth and intrigue.  The story of Tristan Price, a young man trapped in a suffocating family environment who seeks escape through drugs and partying,  feels predictable and lacks emotional resonance.\n\nThe director's attempts to elevate the film through stylistic flourishes backfire, creating a distracting and jarring viewing experience.

It's as if the director, in a desperate attempt to inject some semblance of excitement,  decided to throw every editing trick in the book at the screen,  hoping something would stick.\n\nWhat makes \"Loaded\"  truly disturbing is the realization that a significant amount of money was apparently invested in this cinematic catastrophe.

It was way too over-the-top.\n\nSo, yeah,  skip this one unless you're obsessed with one of the actors.  Speaking of which,  the entire cast was pretty good-looking,  especially the girls! But let's be real,  Chace is the main attraction here! \n",
    "\"The Mad Magician\" features Vincent Price as a vengeful magician seeking retribution against those who have exploited his talents. Despite a promising premise, the film falls short of Price's usual brilliance, offering a predictable thriller with a somewhat lackluster performance from the horror icon. \n\nThe supporting cast includes familiar faces like Patrick O'Neal, Mary Murphy, Eva Gabor, and Jay Novello, but their performances do little to elevate the film's mediocrity. While fans of Vincent Price might find some enjoyment in his presence, \"The Mad Magician\" is ultimately a forgettable entry in his filmography. \n",
    "\"Stanley & Iris\" is a heartwarming film that captures the struggles and triumphs of everyday life with a gentle touch. While inspired by Pat Barker's novel \"Union Street,\" the film takes a more optimistic and hopeful approach to its subject matter.\n\nBarker's novel, known for its stark realism and unflinching portrayal of working-class struggles, is a powerful and often disturbing read. The film, while acknowledging the challenges faced by its characters,  chooses to focus on the resilience of the human spirit and the power of connection. \n\nJane Fonda delivers a captivating performance as Iris, a woman facing numerous obstacles who finds strength and solace in an unexpected friendship.  The film's beautiful cinematography, inspiring soundtrack, and hopeful tone create a moving cinematic experience. \n\nFor those seeking a heartwarming story of perseverance and human connection, \"Stanley & Iris\" offers a satisfying and emotionally resonant experience.  While it departs from the bleakness of Barker's novel,  it captures a different, but equally valid, aspect of the human experience. \n",
    "\"Stanley & Iris\" falls tragically short of its potential, squandering the talents of its acclaimed cast and director on a poorly conceived and executed narrative.  The film, despite aiming for heartwarming inspiration,  lands with a thud,  leaving the viewer feeling emotionally unfulfilled.\n\nRobert De Niro and Jane Fonda, two powerhouse performers,  deliver surprisingly underwhelming performances. Their chemistry is non-existent,  making their characters' budding relationship feel forced and unconvincing. De Niro's portrayal of Stanley, a kind-hearted but functionally illiterate man,  lacks the nuance and depth one would expect from such a seasoned actor.  \n\nJane Fonda, as Iris, struggles to find a consistent throughline for her character. Her performance feels erratic and uneven,  likely a result of the poorly written script that fails to provide a clear arc or motivation for her character. \n\nDirector Martin Ritt, known for his masterful storytelling, seems to have lost his touch in this film.  The pacing is excruciatingly slow,  lacking the energy and momentum required to engage the viewer. The film's attempts at humor fall flat, and the overall tone feels more like a melodramatic after-school special than a nuanced exploration of literacy and human connection. \n\nDespite its intentions, \"Stanley & Iris\" is a cinematic misfire, a disappointing waste of talent that ultimately leaves the viewer feeling disheartened rather than uplifted. \n",
    "\"Stanley & Iris\" serves as a cautionary tale for aspiring filmmakers, demonstrating how even a talented cast and crew can be undone by a poorly conceived script and misguided direction. \n\nHere are some key takeaways from this film's missteps:\n\n* **Character Credibility Matters:**  The portrayal of Stanley as a highly intelligent, yet functionally illiterate,  character strains credulity and undermines the film's premise. \n* **Strong Dialogue is Essential:** The film's dialogue feels stilted and unnatural, hindering the actors' ability to deliver believable performances.\n* **Pacing Impacts Engagement:**  The film's slow pace and lack of narrative momentum create a tedious viewing experience. \n* **Avoid Clichés:** The film's reliance on overused tropes and predictable plot devices further diminishes its impact.\n\n\"Stanley & Iris\" is a film best avoided. It's a reminder that even the most talented individuals can't overcome a fundamentally flawed script and a lack of directorial vision. \n",
    "\"The Pigs\" begins with a hilariously absurd scene of an orchestra audience descending into chaos, but this initial comedic spark quickly fizzles.  The film's lack of a coherent narrative and its reliance on cryptic, impenetrable dialogue make for a frustrating and ultimately off-putting viewing experience. \n\nDespite strong cinematography by the acclaimed Vilmos Zsigmond and brief appearances by future stars Sally Kirkland and Frederic Forrest,  \"The Pigs\"  is an experimental film that's likely to alienate even those familiar with the era's counter-culture cinema. \n",

This film swings for the fences in every genre imaginable - comedy, drama, action - but strikes out spectacularly at every turn.\n\nThe jokes are so corny, they'll make you groan louder than a dad at a pun competition.  The drama is so over-the-top,  you'll think you've wandered into a soap opera audition. And the action?  Brace yourself for shaky cam that makes \"The Blair Witch Project\" look like a steadycam masterpiece.\n\nJamie Foxx, bless his heart, tries his best to deliver some serious lines,  but the script is so ludicrous, it's like watching a Shakespearean actor perform a commercial for laundry detergent.  And Bill Gates as the villain?  Yeah, you read that right.  The casting alone is enough to send you into fits of laughter.\n\n\"Bait\" is the kind of film that makes you question your life choices. You'll find yourself longing for the sweet release of a desert trek with Meryl Streep, anything to escape the torture of witnessing this cinematic disaster unfold. \n\nSo, buckle up for exploding cars that defy the laws of physics,  dialogue that will make your brain melt,  and enough overacting to power a small city.  \"Bait\"  is a truly unforgettable experience, but not for the reasons its creators intended. \n\n\n",
    "\"The Great Yokai War,\" while directed by the prolific Takashi Miike,  represents a less successful entry in his filmography.   The film,  while drawing comparisons to \"The Neverending Story\" for its fantastical premise,  lacks the depth and originality that characterize Miike's more acclaimed works.\n\nThe narrative focuses on a young boy chosen to fight against demonic forces,  but his character development feels superficial,  and his constant screaming grows tiresome for the viewer.  The film's pacing is noticeably slow,  contributing to a sense of narrative inertia. \n\nWhile some visual elements reflect Miike's signature style,  the film lacks the distinctive personality and creative energy present in his other works.  \n\nFor viewers new to Miike's filmography,  it's advisable to start with films like \"Gozu,\"  \"Ichi the Killer,\" or \"Audition,\"  before venturing into his more experimental or less successful projects.  \"The Great Yokai War,\"  while offering a glimpse into Miike's range as a filmmaker,  is unlikely to satisfy those seeking his more distinctive and captivating cinematic experiences. \n",

The scenes depicting Scrooge's past are particularly weak,  lacking the poignancy and impact they should carry.\n\nThe supporting cast, with the exception of a chronically over-the-top Frank Finlay,  sleepwalks through their roles.  Even Edward Woodward, as the Ghost of Christmas Present,  delivers a bizarre and distracting performance, more reminiscent of a pantomime than a spectral being. \n\nThe film's overall tone is bland and uninspired.

Scott as Ebenezer Scrooge,  has drawn criticism for its numerous deviations from the source material and its uneven production quality. \n\nSources report that Scott,  a highly acclaimed actor,  delivers a surprisingly subdued performance,  with moments of brilliance overshadowed by a general lack of energy and emotional depth. The film's special effects,  particularly those used to depict the ghost of Jacob Marley, have been deemed dated and underwhelming. \n\nMost notably,  the film omits a crucial scene from the book:  Scrooge's journey with the Ghost of Christmas Present to witness the spirit of the season in even the most impoverished corners of the world.  This omission,  viewers say,  robs the film of a key emotional element that underscores the transformative power of Christmas.\n\nWhile Scott's portrayal of the redeemed Scrooge has been praised as refreshing,  other supporting characters,  including Bob Cratchit and Tiny Tim,  fail to resonate,  with some citing unconvincing performances from the child actors. \n\n\n",

Scott's portrayal lacks the emotional depth and dynamism necessary to fully embody the iconic character,  resulting in a flat and unengaging interpretation.\n\nCompared to Alistair Sim's iconic performance, Scott's Scrooge feels particularly underwhelming.  Both his initial miserly demeanor and his eventual transformation lack conviction,  hindering the film's ability to evoke a genuine emotional response from the viewer.\n\nThe supporting cast also pales in comparison to other adaptations, including the Alistair Sim version and even musical interpretations.

Fate, in its infinite wisdom,  presented us with \"Father of the Pride.\"  Having previously abandoned the show after a single episode, I approached this second viewing with a sense of trepidation.\n\nThe similarities to \"The Simpsons\" are undeniable,  with the lion family mirroring the dynamics of their Springfield counterparts.  However,  \"Father of the Pride\" lacks the sharp wit and subversive humor that has made \"The Simpsons\" an enduring cultural touchstone.\n\nWhile the show's TV-14 rating suggests a level of adult content,  I found the humor to be rather tame,  relying on tired tropes and predictable jokes.  The occasional forays into risqué territory,  particularly regarding homosexual themes,  lacked the satirical edge that could have made them truly amusing.\n\nDespite its shortcomings,  \"Father of the Pride\"  did elicit a few genuine chuckles.

This futuristic adaptation of Jules Verne's classic novel offers a delightful blend of imagination and DIY ingenuity.\n\nThe film, shot in New England with a local cast,  will delight viewers familiar with the region,  offering a fun glimpse of familiar locations transformed into a sci-fi landscape.  While the sound editing might be rough around the edges, it adds to the film's endearingly homemade feel.\n\nBrett Piper, a master of practical effects, showcases his early talent with imaginative creature designs, even if the animation is a bit jerky at times.  The film's music is surprisingly good, adding to the overall sense of wonder and adventure. \n\n\"Mysterious Planet\"  is a testament to the power of passion and creativity in filmmaking.

The story centers on a man, played by William Russ, who returns to his family after a prolonged absence,  struggling to reconnect and make amends.\n\nPeter Falk, in a welcome appearance, plays multiple roles,  acting as a catalyst for the protagonist's emotional journey.  While William Russ might not be a household name, he delivers a solid performance.\n\nThe film's predictability and somewhat cheesy dialogue prevent it from achieving true emotional depth.  The narrative unfolds in a familiar manner,  lacking the surprises or nuanced character development that could have elevated it beyond standard television fare.\n\nWhile \"The Price of a Broken Heart\" might not be a cinematic masterpiece, it offers a passable viewing experience for those seeking a sentimental story with a touch of nostalgia thanks to Peter Falk's presence. \n\n\n",

Even seasoned actors like Peter Falk and Valerie Bertinelli struggle to elevate the material, delivering flat and uninspired performances.\n\nThe film's direction and editing exacerbate its shortcomings.  Scenes feel disjointed, lacking a natural flow, and the overall pacing feels uneven.  The performances of the supporting cast, including Jennifer Pisana as Noah's daughter,  are particularly weak,  likely hindered by the poor quality of the script.\n\nRather than spending your precious holiday time on this cinematic disappointment,  seek out truly heartwarming and well-crafted films.

It felt like a betrayal, a crass commercial for toys disguised as a film.\n\nEvery new creature, every bizarre alien, every quirky droid screamed \"marketable merchandise.\"  The Ewoks, those cuddly teddy bears of the forest, were clearly designed to tug at the heartstrings – and purse strings – of children worldwide. It felt like George Lucas was holding us hostage, exploiting our love for Star Wars to peddle his plastic creations. \n\nThe plot itself was a rehash of \"A New Hope,\"  trading originality for a lazy rehash of the Death Star saga.

We're introduced to a trio of female characters engaging in what can only be described as  a cringeworthy display of juvenile gossip and giggling, fueled by gin and cigarettes.  It's a scene that feels more akin to a bad sitcom than a sophisticated comedy.\n\nThe narrative then takes an even more baffling turn when Andie MacDowell's character,  a school headmistress,  embarks on a romance with a former student,  a young organist who was once under her tutelage.  This questionable relationship is further complicated by the interference of her \"best friend,\"  a character who embodies every negative stereotype of a jealous and manipulative woman.\n\nFrom this point forward, the film devolves into a series of contrived and emotionally unsatisfying events.  The characters' motivations feel shallow,  their actions often bordering on the absurd.  The attempt to inject a sense of growth and maturity into the narrative through a symbolic gesture of discarding chocolates falls flat, feeling more like a desperate afterthought than a genuine moment of character development.\n\nDespite its charming setting and talented cast,  \"Four Weddings and a Funeral\"  ultimately fails to deliver on its promise of witty banter and heartwarming romance.

The editing feels disjointed, the cinematography uninspired,  leaving the viewer yearning for a glimmer of visual or narrative spark. \n\n\"Foxes\"  is a cinematic wasteland,  a forgotten relic of a bygone era that offers little to engage the modern viewer.  It's a film best left undisturbed,  a cautionary tale of wasted potential and unfulfilled promise. \n\n\n",
    "\"Rock 'n' Roll High School\" is a high-energy, campy celebration of teenage rebellion set to the iconic soundtrack of the Ramones. This cult classic embraces its B-movie roots,  delivering a fun and over-the-top experience that's sure to delight fans of punk rock and '70s/80s teen comedies.\n\nThe film follows a group of students who challenge their oppressive school administration,  using the power of music and their love for the Ramones to fight for their right to rock. While the plot might be predictable and the acting a bit rough around the edges, the film's infectious energy and iconic soundtrack more than compensate for its shortcomings.\n\n\"Rock 'n' Roll High School\" is a fun and nostalgic trip back to a time when punk rock was king and teenage rebellion was a badge of honor.  It's a film that embraces its own absurdity, delivering a uniquely entertaining experience that continues to resonate with audiences. \n\n\n",
    "\"I Sell the Dead\" is a wild ride, a low-budget horror-comedy that might not be for everyone, but Dominic Monaghan fans will definitely want to check it out! He brings his A-game,  throwing himself into this offbeat role with gusto. \n\nNow,  let's be honest,  the film isn't exactly polished. The directing is a bit rough around the edges, and some of the supporting actors,  especially Jack's best friend,  aren't going to be winning any Oscars anytime soon. \n\nBut that's part of the film's charm! It's a scrappy, DIY kind of movie that embraces its limitations.  Think of it as a cinematic experiment, a chance to see Monaghan explore a truly unique character in a truly offbeat story.\n\nIf you're expecting a slick, Hollywood production,  you'll be disappointed.  But if you're in the mood for something different, something quirky, and something with a dash of dark humor,  \"I Sell the Dead\" might just surprise you. \n\n\n",
    "\"And All Through the House,\"  a festive episode of \"Tales from the Crypt,\"  takes a dark and twisted turn down a familiar holiday lane.  Imagine, if you will,  a wife,  her hands stained crimson,  standing over her poker-slain husband,  a symphony of Christmas carols playing softly in the background.  Just as she's about to dispose of the body,  a visitor arrives—a hulking figure clad in a tattered Santa suit,  his eyes gleaming with madness.\n\nThus begins a macabre game of cat-and-mouse,  as the wife,  played with chilling desperation by Mary Ellen Trainor,  attempts to conceal her crime while fending off the increasingly unhinged Santa,  brought to life with unsettling intensity by Larry Drake.  \n\nSadly,  this episode,  despite its intriguing premise,  fails to break new ground. It relies heavily on tired horror tropes,  from the murderous Santa cliché to the adulterous wife seeking to escape the consequences of her actions.  The narrative feels predictable,  lacking the sharp twists and turns that usually characterize the series.  \n\nWhile \"And All Through the House\" might offer a few moments of gruesome entertainment,  it ultimately lacks the originality and bite that make \"Tales from the Crypt\"  so captivating.  It's a Christmas horror story that feels more like a lump of coal than a sparkling gift. \n\n\n\n\n",
    "\"Satantango\" is undoubtedly a demanding film, requiring patience and a willingness to immerse oneself in its slow-burning, contemplative style.  While its 7.5-hour runtime might seem daunting,  it allows for a deeply immersive experience,  exploring the complexities of human nature and the rhythms of rural life with a mesmerizing slowness.\n\nThe film's focus on dialogue and character interaction, rather than action-driven plot, might not appeal to all viewers.  However,  those seeking a cinematic experience that challenges conventional storytelling norms and delves into the depths of human existence are likely to find \"Satantango\" a rewarding, albeit challenging, journey. \n\nWhile the film's characters might not be traditionally likeable,  their flaws and complexities make them all the more fascinating.  \"Satantango\" is a film that invites contemplation and reflection,  a cinematic tapestry woven with patience and artistry. \n",
    "Picture this:  You're settling into a plush seat in a darkened theater,  expecting a grand cinematic spectacle. The screen lights up with \"Iberia,\" a film showcasing the beauty and passion of Spanish dance and music.  Now,  if you're a die-hard fan of classical music or modern dance,  you might be in for a treat. But for the average moviegoer, an hour and a half of this might feel like an eternity.\n\nIt's like watching a beautifully choreographed dance recital on a giant screen. While director Carlos Saura, known for his dance films, captures the grace and skill of the dancers, the lack of a compelling narrative makes it feel more like a filmed stage performance than a truly cinematic experience. \n\nIf you're craving breathtaking dance sequences woven into a captivating story, I'd recommend a Bollywood film instead. They've mastered the art of blending spectacle and storytelling in a way that keeps you on the edge of your seat. \n\n\"Iberia,\" while visually impressive,  lacks that extra something to make it truly memorable. It's a beautiful, but ultimately underwhelming,  exploration of Spanish artistry. \n\n\n",
    "\"Dakota,\" despite its attempts at intrigue,  ultimately fails to deliver a compelling cinematic experience. The film's narrative is muddled and confusing, lacking a clear direction or purpose. \n\nThe characters are poorly developed,  lacking depth or engaging qualities. Michael Bowen's performance as the central character, a man consumed by paranoia and misjudgment, feels one-dimensional and unsympathetic.  \n\nThe film's tone is similarly uninspired,  failing to establish a consistent mood or engage the viewer on an emotional level. It's neither edgy nor imaginative,  lacking the cleverness or irony that could have elevated its otherwise predictable narrative. \n\n\"Dakota's\" theatrical release was likely bypassed for a reason. Its presence on \"This Network\" further suggests a lack of quality control in programming.  Viewers seeking a more rewarding and stimulating viewing experience are advised to explore alternative options. \n\n\n",
    "I settled in, hoping for a decent thriller, but as the opening scenes of \"Dakota\" flickered across the screen, I knew I was in trouble. The father and son at the heart of the story looked like they'd been randomly plucked from different planets, their supposed familial bond utterly unconvincing.\n\nThe male lead, saddled with a poorly written role, stumbled through his scenes with a distinct lack of charisma. The plot was predictable, the twists telegraphed from a mile away.  Even the supporting characters, including the female lead and her cop brother, made decisions that defied logic, their actions driven by plot convenience rather than believable motivations. \n\nThe film lumbered towards its nonsensical ending, leaving me feeling like I'd endured a cinematic purgatory,  paying my dues in bad movie karma in the hopes of stumbling upon a decent film sometime in the future. The only saving graces were Clancy Brown, whose talent was criminally wasted in a minor role, and Michael Pollard, who managed to inject a spark of life into his scenes.\n\n\"Dakota\" is a cinematic wasteland, a reminder that even with a decent premise,  a film can be utterly derailed by poor writing,  uninspired direction,  and a cast that seems to have wandered in from a community theater production.  Avoid at all costs. \n",
    "\"The Alamo: 13 Days to Glory,\" a film that purports to recount the legendary battle,  stands as a disheartening testament to squandered potential and misguided ambition.  Director Burt Kennedy,  once a skilled craftsman of cinematic narratives,  seems to have lost his touch in this lumbering and disjointed production.\n\nThe film's visual aesthetic betrays its limited budget,  with battle sequences shamelessly lifted from the superior 1955 film \"The Last Command.\"  Even the newly filmed action scenes are plagued by a sense of disorganization and incompetence,  resembling a poorly executed student film project.\n\nThe pacing is glacial,  the acting a bizarre mix of overblown theatrics and lifeless delivery.  While Raul Julia manages to elevate his performance above the general mediocrity,  the majority of the cast struggles to imbue their characters with any semblance of authenticity.\n\nHistorical inaccuracies further detract from the film's credibility,  leaving the viewer questioning the filmmakers' commitment to accurately portraying this pivotal event. And as if these flaws weren't enough,  the film's excessive three-hour runtime becomes an endurance test for even the most dedicated history buff.\n\nThose seeking a compelling and visually engaging depiction of the Alamo are advised to seek out John Wayne's 1960 version or the aforementioned \"The Last Command.\"  \"The Alamo:  13 Days to Glory\"  is a cinematic misfire best left forgotten. \n\n\n",
    "\"The Alamo: 13 Days to Glory,\"  while featuring the iconic James Arness in a leading role, has generated mixed responses from viewers, with some criticizing its historical accuracy and technical inconsistencies.\n\nThe film's portrayal of the Alamo siege has been called into question, with some viewers pointing out factual errors and inconsistencies in the depiction of events.   Certain details,  such as the cannon sequence with its unrealistic depiction of artillery, have been singled out for their lack of attention to historical accuracy.\n\nAdditionally, some viewers have found the costume choices,  particularly Brian Keith's hat, to be distracting and out of place. \n\nWhile \"The Alamo: 13 Days to Glory\" might entertain fans of James Arness or classic Westerns,  it's important to approach the film with an understanding that its historical accuracy is debatable. \n\n\n",
    "\"The Alamo: 13 Days to Glory\"  falls short of delivering a satisfying cinematic experience,  despite its attempt to portray the legendary battle.  The film leans more heavily on the romanticized mythology surrounding the event than on historical accuracy.\n\nThe production values are noticeably low,  giving the impression of a hastily assembled project. The casting choices are particularly problematic,  with a group of older, recognizable television actors failing to convincingly portray the youthful energy and determination of the real-life figures.  \n\nWhile previous adaptations,  such as John Wayne's or Fess Parker's versions,  might have taken similar liberties with historical accuracy,  they at least possessed a sense of energy and cinematic flair that is missing from this rendition.\n\n\"The Alamo: 13 Days to Glory\" is a disappointingly flat and uninspired film that fails to capture the true essence of this pivotal historical event. \n\n\n",

While the film's pacing is slow and its historical accuracy is debatable,  it boasts a strong cast and a memorable score.\n\nJames Arness embodies the iconic Jim Bowie, while Brian Keith portrays the legendary Davy Crockett.  Alec Baldwin takes on the role of Colonel Travis, and Raul Julia commands the screen as General Santa Anna. \n\nThe film also features notable performances from David Ogden Stiers, Kathleen York, and Jim Metzler.

The film's excessive runtime further diminishes its impact, as the few engaging moments are overshadowed by a pervading sense of tedium.\n\n\"The Alamo: Thirteen Days to Glory\"  is a film that falls short of its potential,  offering a superficial and ultimately unsatisfying cinematic experience. \n\n\n\n\n",
    "Norman Maclean's \"A River Runs Through It\" is a story that sings with the poetry of nature,  the bonds of brotherhood,  and the echoes of a bygone era.  Robert Redford's film adaptation,  however,  feels like a pale imitation,  a watered-down version that loses the heart and soul of the original.\n\nRedford inserts scenes of contrived action and forced melodrama,  moments that feel alien to the spirit of Maclean's prose.  Brad Pitt,  miscast as the charismatic and enigmatic Paul Maclean,  struggles to capture the character's essence,  leaving viewers with a hollow shell of a man who should have burned bright on the screen.\n\nWhile the film offers glimpses of visual beauty,  particularly in the meticulously crafted fly-fishing scenes,  it fails to capture the depth and complexity of Maclean's story. The female characters,  so vividly rendered in the book, are reduced to mere shadows,  their presence diminished and their impact lost.\n\n\"A River Runs Through It,\"  in Redford's hands,  becomes a film of missed opportunities,  a sentimentalized and ultimately unsatisfying adaptation that fails to honor the brilliance of its source material.  \n\n\n\n\n",
    "\"A River Runs Through It\" is a visually stunning film,  but its breathtaking scenery can't disguise its narrative shortcomings. The story,  centering on two brothers from a strict Presbyterian family, feels slow-paced and lacks a compelling emotional core. \n\nPaul,  played by Brad Pitt,  is a charming but ultimately frustrating character whose reckless behavior and destructive choices dominate the narrative. His brother,  Norm,  follows a more conventional path,  but his storyline lacks the depth and intrigue to fully engage the viewer. \n\nThe film touches upon themes of family,  faith, and the allure of nature,  but it fails to explore these themes with any real depth.  Even a potentially interesting subplot involving Paul's relationship with a Native American woman feels underdeveloped and ultimately falls flat.  \n\nDespite its beautiful visuals, \"A River Runs Through It\"  feels like a missed opportunity,  a film that prioritizes picturesque scenery over a compelling story.  \n\n\n",
    "\"A River Runs Through It,\" while technically well-crafted with beautiful cinematography and a solid performance from Robert Redford,  ultimately struggles to resonate due to its underwhelming narrative.\n\nThe story,  exploring the lives of two brothers in a small Montana town at the turn of the century,  lacks a clear direction and feels emotionally distant. The narrator,  also the author of the source material,  comes across as a rigid and unsympathetic character,  trapped by the same societal constraints as his preacher father.  \n\nThe film touches upon themes of family,  loss,  and the search for meaning, but it fails to delve deeply into these complexities.  The brothers' relationship,  central to the narrative,  remains unexplored,  leaving the viewer with a sense of unfulfilled potential.\n\nThe film's predictable ending further diminishes its impact,  failing to offer any surprising insights or a sense of catharsis.

    "\"A River Runs Through It\"  left me with a distinct feeling of \"What was the point?\"  The film,  despite boasting beautiful scenery and costumes,  lacks a clear plot or a central conflict to drive the narrative.\n\nThe absence of these fundamental storytelling elements results in a meandering and ultimately unsatisfying viewing experience.  Despite its relatively short runtime of 123 minutes,  the film feels significantly longer due to its lack of narrative momentum.\n\nWhile not the worst film I've encountered (that dubious honor now belongs to \"The Fast and the Furious\"),  \"A River Runs Through It\"  falls short due to its lack of substance.

Jimmy Stewart, as always,  radiated charm,  and Walter Brennan, a master of gruff wisdom, added his familiar touch of warmth. \n\nBut then the story took a turn that made me spit out my drink.

    "\"Bend of the River\" sweeps you away to the rugged beauty of the Pacific Northwest, a land painted in hues of emerald and sapphire, where towering trees stand sentinel over untamed rivers.  James Stewart, a cinematic icon,  embodies Glyn McLyntock, a hardened cattleman with a shadowed past.\n\nThe film gallops along,  a thrilling tapestry of action and adventure,  as McLyntock battles against a corrupt government determined to exploit the land and its people.  Yet,  amidst the stunning scenery and heart-pounding action,  a familiar figure emerges—the cynical hero,  a trope so deeply ingrained in Hollywood's DNA that it feels both comforting and frustrating.\n\nStewart's McLyntock,  while undeniably charismatic,  possesses a gruff exterior and a disdain for authority that borders on the unlikeable.  He's a man hardened by experience,  his kindness reserved only for his closest companions. \n\nBut fear not, for the film's supporting characters,  brought to life by a cast of seasoned performers like Walter Brennan,  Royal Dano, and Harry Morgan,  inject a much-needed dose of warmth and humor into the narrative.  Their presence provides a counterpoint to McLyntock's cynicism,  creating a richer and more engaging cinematic experience. \n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "\"Return to Cabin by the Lake\"  is a direct-to-video sequel that attempts to capitalize on the moderate success of its predecessor,  \"Cabin by the Lake.\" However,  the film fails to recapture the original's modest charms,  instead presenting a poorly executed and narratively flawed horror experience.\n\nThe film's plot is riddled with inconsistencies and nonsensical developments,  lacking the coherence and suspense required for an engaging thriller. The dialogue is clunky and unnatural,  further hindering the film's ability to create believable characters or scenarios. \n\nThe technical aspects of the film are equally amateurish.

Its numerous shortcomings outweigh any potential for entertainment,  making it a regrettable waste of time.  \n\n\n\n\n",
    "\"Return to Cabin by the Lake\"  is a darkly comedic sequel that boldly embraces its over-the-top premise and takes viewers on a wild ride through the world of Hollywood filmmaking. The film gleefully skewers the industry's excesses,  offering a satirical glimpse into the egos, ambitions, and questionable morals that often lurk behind the scenes. \n\nJudd Nelson effortlessly reprises his role as the diabolical Stanley Caldwell,  this time using his cunning and ruthlessness to infiltrate a film production based on his own murderous exploits. The film's meta-narrative, with a serial killer masquerading as a director,  provides ample opportunities for dark humor and suspense.\n\nDahlia Salem delivers a strong performance as Alison,  the ambitious screenwriter determined to understand the depths of Stanley's depravity.  The film cleverly uses humor to highlight the irony of Alison unwittingly collaborating with the very subject of her investigation.\n\nWhile the film's conclusion might stretch credulity,  \"Return to Cabin by the Lake\"  delivers an entertaining blend of horror,  comedy,  and satire.  Director Po-Chih Leong,  while employing some unnecessary stylistic flourishes,  effectively captures the film's darkly comedic tone.  While not quite as sharp as its predecessor,  this sequel offers a fun and twisted exploration of Hollywood's underbelly. \n",
    "\"Return to Cabin by the Lake\"  suffers from a jarring inconsistency in its visual aesthetic,  likely due to budgetary constraints.  The film oscillates between traditional film cinematography and sequences seemingly captured with a standard video camera,  creating a disjointed and distracting viewing experience.  This lack of visual cohesion detracts from the film's overall impact,  undermining any attempts to establish a consistent mood or atmosphere. \n\nWhile the film might hold some interest for those familiar with the original \"Cabin by the Lake,\" serving as a point of comparison,  it's unlikely to appeal to a broader audience.

    "The experience of watching \"Return to Cabin by the Lake\"  raises intriguing questions about the creative choices made in crafting a sequel, particularly regarding its jarring shift in visual style. While the original \"Cabin by the Lake\"  achieved a certain level of success within its made-for-TV limitations,  the sequel falters,  partly due to its jarring use of digital video footage intercut with traditional film.\n\nThe jarring juxtaposition of visual styles,  without a clear narrative justification,  raises questions about the filmmakers' intentions and the impact of budgetary constraints on creative decisions.  The lack of a satisfying conclusion,  especially in contrast to the original's open ending,  further contributes to a sense of frustration and unfulfilled expectations. \n\nThis experience highlights the delicate balance filmmakers must strike when crafting sequels,  balancing audience expectations with a desire for innovation,  while also navigating the practical limitations of production.  \"Return to Cabin by the Lake\"  serves as a reminder that even a successful premise can be undermined by inconsistent execution and questionable creative choices. \n\n\n",

And Judd Nelson,  while always entertaining,  goes a bit overboard with the crazy-eyed killer act. \n\nThe whole thing feels rushed,  like they were trying to crank out a sequel quickly.  It's a shame, because with a little more time and effort,  this sequel could have been something special. \n\n\n\n\n",
    "\"Return to Cabin by the Lake\" is a disappointing sequel that pales in comparison to the original film.  Here's a breakdown of its shortcomings:\n\n* **Weak Connection to Original:**  With only the character of Stanley returning, the sequel lacks a strong link to the first film.\n* **Poor Acting:** The acting is subpar, even bordering on comical in its awkwardness. \n* **Unfavorable Comparisons:**  The film is comparable in quality to the disappointing sequels of \"Urban Legend\" and \"Blair Witch,\" but with even worse acting. \n* **Detracts from the Original:** Watching this sequel might negatively impact your enjoyment of the original film. \n\n**Recommendation:** Avoid this sequel and cherish the memory of the first \"Cabin by the Lake.\" \n"
