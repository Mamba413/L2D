    "Abstract expressionism is a post–World War II art movement in American painting, developed in New York City in the 1940s. It was the first specifically American movement to achieve international influence and put New York at the center of the Western art world, a role formerly filled by Paris.",
    "Although the term \"abstract expressionism\" was first applied to American art in 1946 by the art critic Robert Coates, it had been first used in Germany in 1919 in the magazine Der Sturm, regarding German Expressionism",
    "In the United States, Alfred Barr was the first to use this term in 1929 in relation to works by Wassily Kandinsky.",
    "Cubism is an early-20th-century avant-garde art movement that revolutionized European painting and sculpture, and inspired related movements in music, literature and architecture",
    "In Cubist artwork, objects are analyzed, broken up and reassembled in an abstracted form—instead of depicting objects from a single viewpoint, the artist depicts the subject from a multitude of viewpoints to represent the subject in a greater context. Cubism has been considered the most influential art movement of the 20th century. The term is broadly used in association with a wide variety of art produced in Paris (Montmartre and Montparnasse) or near Paris (Puteaux) during the 1910s and throughout the 1920s.",
    "The movement was pioneered by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque, and joined by Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Robert Delaunay, Henri Le Fauconnier, Juan Gris, and Fernand Léger. One primary influence that led to Cubism was the representation of three-dimensional form in the late works of Paul Cézanne. A retrospective of Cézanne's paintings was held at the Salon d'Automne of 1904, current works were displayed at the 1905 and 1906 Salon d'Automne, followed by two commemorative retrospectives after his death in 1907.",
    "In France, offshoots of Cubism developed, including Orphism, abstract art and later Purism. The impact of Cubism was far-reaching and wide-ranging",
    "In France and other countries Futurism, Suprematism, Dada, Constructivism, Vorticism, De Stijl and Art Deco developed in response to Cubism",
    "Early Futurist paintings hold in common with Cubism the fusing of the past and the present, the representation of different views of the subject pictured at the same time or successively, also called multiple perspective, simultaneity or multiplicity, while Constructivism was influenced by Picasso's technique of constructing sculpture from separate elements. Other common threads between these disparate movements include the faceting or simplification of geometric forms, and the association of mechanization and modern life.",
    "Surrealism is a cultural movement that developed in Europe in the aftermath of World War I in which artists depicted unnerving, illogical scenes and developed techniques to allow the unconscious mind to express itself. Its aim was, according to leader André Breton, to \"resolve the previously contradictory conditions of dream and reality into an absolute reality, a super-reality\", or surreality. It produced works of painting, writing, theatre, filmmaking, photography, and other media.",
    "Works of Surrealism feature the element of surprise, unexpected juxtapositions and non sequitur",
    "However, many Surrealist artists and writers regard their work as an expression of the philosophical movement first and foremost (for instance, of the \"pure psychic automatism\" Breton speaks of in the first Surrealist Manifesto), with the works themselves being secondary, i.e",
    "artifacts of surrealist experimentation. Leader Breton was explicit in his assertion that Surrealism was, above all, a revolutionary movement",
    "At the time, the movement was associated with political causes such as communism and anarchism",
    "It was influenced by the Dada movement of the 1910s.",
    "The term \"Surrealism\" originated with Guillaume Apollinaire in 1917. However, the Surrealist movement was not officially established until after October 1924, when the Surrealist Manifesto published by French poet and critic André Breton succeeded in claiming the term for his group over a rival faction led by Yvan Goll, who had published his own surrealist manifesto two weeks prior. The most important center of the movement was Paris, France",
    "From the 1920s onward, the movement spread around the globe, impacting the visual arts, literature, film, and music of many countries and languages, as well as political thought and practice, philosophy, and social theory.",
    "Renaissance art (1350 - 1620 AD) is the painting, sculpture, and decorative arts of the period of European history known as the Renaissance, which emerged as a distinct style in Italy in about AD 1400, in parallel with developments which occurred in philosophy, literature, music, science, and technology",
    "Renaissance art took as its foundation the art of Classical antiquity, perceived as the noblest of ancient traditions, but transformed that tradition by absorbing recent developments in the art of Northern Europe and by applying contemporary scientific knowledge",
    "Along with Renaissance humanist philosophy, it spread throughout Europe, affecting both artists and their patrons with the development of new techniques and new artistic sensibilities",
    "For art historians, Renaissance art marks the transition of Europe from the medieval period to the Early Modern age.",
    "The body of art, painting, sculpture, architecture, music and literature identified as \"Renaissance art\" was primarily produced during the 14th, 15th, and 16th centuries in Europe under the combined influences of an increased awareness of nature, a revival of classical learning, and a more individualistic view of man",
    "Scholars no longer believe that the Renaissance marked an abrupt break with medieval values, as is suggested by the French word renaissance, literally meaning \"rebirth\"",
    "In many parts of Europe, Early Renaissance art was created in parallel with Late Medieval art.",
    "The Baroque (UK: /bəˈrɒk/, US: /bəˈroʊk/; French: [baʁɔk]) is a style of architecture, music, dance, painting, sculpture, poetry, and other arts that flourished in Europe from the early 17th century until the 1750s. In the territories of the Spanish and Portuguese empires including the Iberian Peninsula it continued, together with new styles, until the first decade of the 19th century",
    "It followed Renaissance art and Mannerism and preceded the Rococo (in the past often referred to as \"late Baroque\") and Neoclassical styles",
    "It was encouraged by the Catholic Church as a means to counter the simplicity and austerity of Protestant architecture, art, and music, though Lutheran Baroque art developed in parts of Europe as well.",
    "The Baroque style used contrast, movement, exuberant detail, deep colour, grandeur, and surprise to achieve a sense of awe",
    "The style began at the start of the 17th century in Rome, then spread rapidly to France, northern Italy, Spain, and Portugal, then to Austria, southern Germany, and Russia",
    "By the 1730s, it had evolved into an even more flamboyant style, called rocaille or Rococo, which appeared in France and Central Europe until the mid to late 18th century.",
    "In the decorative arts, the style employs plentiful and intricate ornamentation",
    "The departure from Renaissance classicism has its own ways in each country",
    "But a general feature is that everywhere the starting point is the ornamental elements introduced by the Renaissance",
    "The classical repertoire is crowded, dense, overlapping, loaded, in order to provoke shock effects",
    "New motifs introduced by Baroque are: the cartouche, trophies and weapons, baskets of fruit or flowers, and others, made in marquetry, stucco, or carved.",
    "Dada (/ˈdɑːdɑː/) or Dadaism was an art movement of the European avant-garde in the early 20th century, with early centres in Zürich, Switzerland, at the Cabaret Voltaire (in 1916)",
    "Developed in reaction to World War I, the Dada movement consisted of artists who rejected the logic, reason, and aestheticism of modern capitalist society, instead expressing nonsense, irrationality, and anti-bourgeois protest in their works. The art of the movement spanned visual, literary, and sound media, including collage, sound poetry, cut-up writing, and sculpture",
    "Dadaist artists expressed their discontent toward violence, war, and nationalism, and maintained political affinities with radical left-wing and far-left politics.",
    "There is no consensus on the origin of the movement's name; a common story is that the German artist Richard Huelsenbeck slid a paper knife (letter-opener) at random into a dictionary, where it landed on \"dada\", a colloquial French term for a hobby horse",
    "Jean Arp wrote that Tristan Tzara invented the word at 6 p.m",
    "on 6 February 1916, in the Café de la Terrasse in Zürich. Others note that it suggests the first words of a child, evoking a childishness and absurdity that appealed to the group",
    "Still others speculate that the word might have been chosen to evoke a similar meaning (or no meaning at all) in any language, reflecting the movement's internationalism.",
    "The term anti-art, a precursor to Dada, was coined by Marcel Duchamp around 1913 to characterize works that challenge accepted definitions of art. Cubism and the development of collage and abstract art would inform the movement's detachment from the constraints of reality and convention",
    "The work of French poets, Italian Futurists and the German Expressionists would influence Dada's rejection of the tight correlation between words and meaning. Works such as Ubu Roi (1896) by Alfred Jarry and the ballet Parade (1916–17) by Erik Satie would also be characterized as proto-Dadaist works. The Dada movement's principles were first collected in Hugo Ball's Dada Manifesto in 1916.",
    "The Dadaist movement included public gatherings, demonstrations, and publication of art/literary journals; passionate coverage of art, politics, and culture were topics often discussed in a variety of media",
    "Key figures in the movement included Jean Arp, Johannes Baader, Hugo Ball, Marcel Duchamp, Max Ernst, Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven, George Grosz, Raoul Hausmann, John Heartfield, Emmy Hennings, Hannah Höch, Richard Huelsenbeck, Francis Picabia, Man Ray, Hans Richter, Kurt Schwitters, Sophie Taeuber-Arp, Tristan Tzara, and Beatrice Wood, among others",
    "The movement influenced later styles like the avant-garde and downtown music movements, and groups including Surrealism, nouveau réalisme, pop art and Fluxus.",
    "Fauvism /ˈfoʊvɪzm̩/ is the style of les Fauves (French for \"the wild beasts\"), a group of early 20th-century modern artists whose works emphasized painterly qualities and strong colour over the representational or realistic values retained by Impressionism",
    "While Fauvism as a style began around 1904 and continued beyond 1910, the movement as such lasted only a few years, 1905–1908, and had three exhibitions. The leaders of the movement were André Derain, Maurice de Vlaminck, and Henri Matisse.",
    "Pop art is an art movement that emerged in the United Kingdom and the United States during the mid- to late-1950s. The movement presented a challenge to traditions of fine art by including imagery from popular and mass culture, such as advertising, comic books and mundane mass-produced objects",
    "One of its aims is to use images of popular culture in art, emphasizing the banal or kitschy elements of any culture, most often through the use of irony. It is also associated with the artists' use of mechanical means of reproduction or rendering techniques",
    "In pop art, material is sometimes visually removed from its known context, isolated, or combined with unrelated material.",
    "Amongst the early artists that shaped the pop art movement were Eduardo Paolozzi and Richard Hamilton in Britain, and Larry Rivers, Ray Johnson",
    "Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns among others in the United States",
    "Pop art is widely interpreted as a reaction to the then-dominant ideas of abstract expressionism, as well as an expansion of those ideas. Due to its utilization of found objects and images, it is similar to Dada",
    "Pop art and minimalism are considered to be art movements that precede postmodern art, or are some of the earliest examples of postmodern art themselves.",
    "Pop art often takes imagery that is currently in use in advertising",
    "Product labeling and logos figure prominently in the imagery chosen by pop artists, seen in the labels of Campbell's Soup Cans, by Andy Warhol",
    "Even the labeling on the outside of a shipping box containing food items for retail has been used as subject matter in pop art, as demonstrated by Warhol's Campbell's Tomato Juice Box, 1964 (pictured).",
    "Neo-Impressionism is a term coined by French art critic Félix Fénéon in 1886 to describe an art movement founded by Georges Seurat",
    "Seurat's most renowned masterpiece, A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte, marked the beginning of this movement when it first made its appearance at an exhibition of the Société des Artistes Indépendants (Salon des Indépendants) in Paris. Around this time, the peak of France's modern era emerged and many painters were in search of new methods",
    "Followers of Neo-Impressionism, in particular, were drawn to modern urban scenes as well as landscapes and seashores",
    "Science-based interpretation of lines and colors influenced Neo-Impressionists' characterization of their own contemporary art. The Pointillist and Divisionist techniques are often mentioned in this context, because they were the dominant techniques in the beginning of the Neo-impressionist movement.",
    "Some argue that Neo-Impressionism became the first true avant-garde movement in painting. The Neo-Impressionists were able to create a movement very quickly in the 19th century, partially due to its strong connection to anarchism, which set a pace for later artistic manifestations. The movement and the style were an attempt to drive \"harmonious\" vision from modern science, anarchist theory, and late 19th-century debate around the value of academic art",
    "The artists of the movement \"promised to employ optical and psycho-biological theories in pursuit of a grand synthesis of the ideal and the real, the fugitive and the essential, science and temperament.\"",
    "Futurism (Italian: Futurismo) was an artistic and social movement that originated in Italy, and to a lesser extent in other countries, in the early 20th century",
    "It emphasized dynamism, speed, technology, youth, violence, and objects such as the car, the airplane, and the industrial city",
    "Its key figures included the Italians Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, Umberto Boccioni, Carlo Carrà, Fortunato Depero, Gino Severini, Giacomo Balla, and Luigi Russolo",
    "Italian Futurism glorified modernity and according to its doctrine, aimed to liberate Italy from the weight of its past.[page needed] Important Futurist works included Marinetti's 1909 Manifesto of Futurism, Boccioni's 1913 sculpture Unique Forms of Continuity in Space, Balla's 1913–1914 painting Abstract Speed + Sound, and Russolo's The Art of Noises (1913).",
    "Although Futurism was largely an Italian phenomenon, parallel movements emerged in Russia, where some Russian Futurists would later go on to found groups of their own; other countries either had a few Futurists or had movements inspired by Futurism",
    "The Futurists practiced in every medium of art, including painting, sculpture, ceramics, graphic design, industrial design, interior design, urban design, theatre, film, fashion, textiles, literature, music, architecture, and even  cooking.",
    "To some extent Futurism influenced the art movements Art Deco, Constructivism, Surrealism, and Dada, and to a greater degree Precisionism, Rayonism, and Vorticism",
    "Passéism [fr] can represent an opposing trend or attitude.",
    "Art Nouveau (/ˌɑːrt nuːˈvoʊ, ˌɑːr/; French: [aʁ nuvo]) is an international style of art, architecture, and applied art, especially the decorative arts",
    "The style is known by different names in different languages: Jugendstil in German, Stile Liberty in Italian, Modernisme in Catalan, and also known as the Modern Style in English",
    "It was popular between 1890 and 1910 during the Belle Époque period, and was a reaction against the academic art, eclecticism and historicism of 19th century architecture and decoration",
    "It was often inspired by natural forms such as the sinuous curves of plants and flowers. Other characteristics of Art Nouveau were a sense of dynamism and movement, often given by asymmetry or whiplash lines, and the use of modern materials, particularly iron, glass, ceramics and later concrete, to create unusual forms and larger open spaces.",
    "One major objective of Art Nouveau was to break down the traditional distinction between fine arts (especially painting and sculpture) and applied arts",
    "It was most widely used in interior design, graphic arts, furniture, glass art, textiles, ceramics, jewellery and metal work",
    "The style responded to leading 19-century theoreticians, such as French architect Eugène-Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc (1814–1879) and British art critic John Ruskin (1819–1900)",
    "In Britain, it was influenced by William Morris and the Arts and Crafts movement",
    "German architects and designers sought a spiritually uplifting Gesamtkunstwerk (\"total work of art\") that would unify the architecture, furnishings, and art in the interior in a common style, to uplift and inspire the residents.",
    "The first Art Nouveau houses and interior decoration appeared in Brussels in the 1890s, in the architecture and interior design of houses designed by Paul Hankar, Henry van de Velde, and especially Victor Horta, whose Hôtel Tassel was completed in 1893. It moved quickly to Paris, where it was adapted by Hector Guimard, who saw Horta's work in Brussels and applied the style for the entrances of the new Paris Métro",
    "It reached its peak at the 1900 Paris International Exposition, which introduced the Art Nouveau work of artists such as Louis Tiffany",
    "It appeared in graphic arts in the posters of Alphonse Mucha, and the glassware of René Lalique and Émile Gallé.",
    "From Belgium and France, Art Nouveau spread to the rest of Europe, taking on different names and characteristics in each country (see Naming section below)",
    "It often appeared not only in capitals, but also in rapidly growing cities that wanted to establish artistic identities (Turin and Palermo in Italy; Glasgow in Scotland; Munich and Darmstadt in Germany), as well as in centres of independence movements (Helsinki in Finland, then part of the Russian Empire; Barcelona in Catalonia, Spain).",
    "By 1914, and with the beginning of the First World War, Art Nouveau was largely exhausted",
    "In the 1920s, it was replaced as the dominant architectural and decorative art style by Art Deco and then Modernism. The Art Nouveau style began to receive more positive attention from critics in the late 1960s, with a major exhibition of the work of Hector Guimard at the Museum of Modern Art in 1970.",
    "Romanticism (also known as the Romantic movement or Romantic era) was an artistic, literary, musical, and intellectual movement that originated in Europe towards the end of the 18th century, and in most areas was at its peak in the approximate period from 1800 to 1850",
    "Romanticism was characterized by its emphasis on emotion and individualism, clandestine literature, idealization of nature, suspicion of science and industrialization, and glorification of the past with a strong preference for the medieval rather than the classical.   It was partly a reaction to the Industrial Revolution, the social and political norms of the Age of Enlightenment, and the scientific rationalization of nature. It was embodied most strongly in the visual arts, music, and literature, but had a major impact on historiography, education, chess, social sciences, and the natural sciences.  It had a significant and complex effect on politics, with romantic thinkers influencing conservatism, liberalism, radicalism, and nationalism.",
    "The movement emphasized intense emotion as an authentic source of aesthetic experience, placing new emphasis on such emotions as fear, horror, terror and awe — especially that experienced in confronting the new aesthetic categories of the sublime and beauty of nature. It elevated folk art and ancient custom to something noble, but also spontaneity as a desirable characteristic (as in the musical impromptu)",
    "In contrast to the rationalism and classicism of the Enlightenment, Romanticism revived medievalism and elements of art and narrative perceived as authentically medieval in an attempt to escape population growth, early urban sprawl, and industrialism.",
    "Although the movement was rooted in the German Sturm und Drang movement, which preferred intuition and emotion to the rationalism of the Enlightenment, the events and ideologies of the French Revolution were also proximate factors since many of the early Romantics were cultural revolutionaries and sympathetic to the revolution. Romanticism assigned a high value to the achievements of \"heroic\" individualists and artists, whose examples, it maintained, would raise the quality of society",
    "It also promoted the individual imagination as a critical authority allowed of freedom from classical notions of form in art",
    "There was a strong recourse to historical and natural inevitability, a Zeitgeist, in the representation of its ideas",
    "In the second half of the 19th century, Realism was offered as a polar opposite to Romanticism. The decline of Romanticism during this time was associated with multiple processes, including social and political changes.",
    "Minimalism describes movements in various forms of art and design, especially visual art and music, where the work is set out to expose the essence, essentials or identity of a subject through eliminating all non-essential forms, features or concepts",
    "As a specific movement in the arts it is identified with developments in post–World War II Western Art, most strongly with American visual arts in the 1960s and early 1970s",
    "Prominent artists associated with this movement include Ad Reinhardt, Nassos Daphnis, Tony Smith, Donald Judd, John McCracken, Agnes Martin, Dan Flavin, Robert Morris, Larry Bell, Anne Truitt, Yves Klein and Frank Stella",
    "Artists themselves have sometimes reacted against the label due to the negative implication of the work being simplistic. Minimalism is often interpreted as a reaction to abstract expressionism and a bridge to postminimal art practices.",
    "Impressionism was a 19th-century art movement characterized by relatively small, thin, yet visible brush strokes, open composition, emphasis on accurate depiction of light in its changing qualities (often accentuating the effects of the passage of time), ordinary subject matter, unusual visual angles, and inclusion of movement as a crucial element of human perception and experience",
    "Impressionism originated with a group of Paris-based artists whose independent exhibitions brought them to prominence during the 1870s and 1880s.",
    "The Impressionists faced harsh opposition from the conventional art community in France",
    "The name of the style derives from the title of a Claude Monet work, Impression, soleil levant (Impression, Sunrise), which provoked the critic Louis Leroy to coin the term in a satirical review published in the Parisian newspaper Le Charivari",
    "The development of Impressionism in the visual arts was soon followed by analogous styles in other media that became known as impressionist music and impressionist literature.",
    "Post-Impressionism (also spelled Postimpressionism) was a predominantly French art movement that developed roughly between 1886 and 1905, from the last Impressionist exhibition to the birth of Fauvism",
    "Post-Impressionism emerged as a reaction against Impressionists' concern for the naturalistic depiction of light and colour",
    "Its broad emphasis on abstract qualities or symbolic content means Post-Impressionism encompasses Les Nabis, Neo-Impressionism, Symbolism, Cloisonnism, the Pont-Aven School, and Synthetism, along with some later Impressionists' work",
    "The movement's principal artists were Paul Cézanne (known as the father of Post-Impressionism), Paul Gauguin, Vincent van Gogh and Georges Seurat.",
    "The term Post-Impressionism was first used by art critic Roger Fry in 1906. Critic Frank Rutter in a review of the Salon d'Automne published in Art News, 15 October 1910, described Othon Friesz as a \"post-impressionist leader\"; there was also an advert for the show The Post-Impressionists of France. Three weeks later, Roger Fry used the term again when he organised the 1910 exhibition Manet and the Post-Impressionists, defining it as the development of French art since Manet.",
    "Post-Impressionists extended Impressionism while rejecting its limitations: they continued using vivid colours, sometimes using impasto (thick application of paint) and painting from life, but were more inclined to emphasize geometric forms, distort form for expressive effect, and use unnatural or modified colour.",
    "Conceptual art, also referred to as conceptualism, is art in which the concept(s) or idea(s) involved in the work take precedence over traditional aesthetic, technical, and material concerns",
    "Some works of conceptual art, sometimes called installations, may be constructed by anyone simply by following a set of written instructions. This method was fundamental to American artist Sol LeWitt's definition of conceptual art, one of the first to appear in print:",
    "Tony Godfrey, author of Conceptual Art (Art & Ideas) (1998), asserts that conceptual art questions the nature of art, a notion that Joseph Kosuth elevated to a definition of art itself in his seminal, early manifesto of conceptual art, Art after Philosophy (1969)",
    "The notion that art should examine its own nature was already a potent aspect of the influential art critic Clement Greenberg's vision of Modern art during the 1950s",
    "With the emergence of an exclusively language-based art in the 1960s, however, conceptual artists such as Art & Language, Joseph Kosuth (who became the American editor of Art-Language), and Lawrence Weiner began a far more radical interrogation of art than was previously possible (see below)",
    "One of the first and most important things they questioned was the common assumption that the role of the artist was to create special kinds of material objects.",
    "Through its association with the Young British Artists and the Turner Prize during the 1990s, in popular usage, particularly in the United Kingdom, \"conceptual art\" came to denote all contemporary art that does not practice the traditional skills of painting and sculpture. One of the reasons why the term \"conceptual art\" has come to be associated with various contemporary practices far removed from its original aims and forms lies in the problem of defining the term itself",
    "As the artist Mel Bochner suggested as early as 1970, in explaining why he does not like the epithet \"conceptual\", it is not always entirely clear what \"concept\" refers to, and it runs the risk of being confused with \"intention\"",
    "Thus, in describing or defining a work of art as conceptual it is important not to confuse what is referred to as \"conceptual\" with an artist's \"intention\".",
    "Gothic art was a style of medieval art that developed in Northern France out of Romanesque art in the 12th century AD, led by the concurrent development of Gothic architecture",
    "It spread to all of Western Europe, and much of Northern, Southern and Central Europe, never quite effacing more classical styles in Italy",
    "In the late 14th century, the sophisticated court style of International Gothic developed, which continued to evolve until the late 15th century",
    "In many areas, especially Germany, Late Gothic art continued well into the 16th century, before being subsumed into Renaissance art",
    "Primary media in the Gothic period included sculpture, panel painting, stained glass, fresco and illuminated manuscripts",
    "The easily recognizable shifts in architecture from Romanesque to Gothic, and Gothic to Renaissance styles, are typically used to define the periods in art in all media, although in many ways figurative art developed at a different pace.",
    "The earliest Gothic art was monumental sculpture, on the walls of Cathedrals and abbeys",
    "Christian art was often typological in nature (see Medieval allegory), showing the stories of the New Testament and the Old Testament side by side",
    "Images of the Virgin Mary changed from the Byzantine iconic form to a more human and affectionate mother, cuddling her infant, swaying from her hip, and showing the refined manners of a well-born aristocratic courtly lady.",
    "Secular art came into its own during this period with the rise of cities, foundation of universities, increase in trade, the establishment of a money-based economy and the creation of a bourgeois class who could afford to patronize the arts and commission works, resulting in a proliferation of paintings and illuminated manuscripts",
    "Increased literacy and a growing body of secular vernacular literature encouraged the representation of secular themes in art",
    "With the growth of cities, trade guilds were formed and artists were often required to be members of a painters' guild",
    "As a result, because of better record keeping, more artists are known to us by name in this period than any previous; some artists were even so bold as to sign their names.",
    "Rococo (/rəˈkoʊkoʊ/, also US: /ˌroʊkəˈkoʊ/), less commonly Roccoco or Late Baroque, is an exceptionally ornamental and theatrical style of architecture, art and decoration which combines asymmetry, scrolling curves, gilding, white and pastel colours, sculpted moulding, and trompe-l'œil frescoes to create surprise and the illusion of motion and drama",
    "It is often described as the final expression of the Baroque movement.",
    "The Rococo style began in France in the 1730s as a reaction against the more formal and geometric Louis XIV style",
    "It was known as the \"style Rocaille\", or \"Rocaille style\". It soon spread to other parts of Europe, particularly northern Italy, Austria, southern Germany, Central Europe and Russia. It also came to influence the other arts, particularly sculpture, furniture, silverware, glassware, painting, music, and theatre. Although originally a secular style primarily used for interiors of private residences, the Rococo had a spiritual aspect to it which led to its widespread use in church interiors, particularly in Central Europe, Portugal, and South America.",
    "Realism in the arts is generally the attempt to represent subject matter truthfully, without artificiality and avoiding speculative fiction and supernatural elements",
    "The term is often used interchangeably with naturalism, even though these terms are not synonymous",
    "Naturalism, as an idea relating to visual representation in Western art, seeks to depict objects with the least possible amount of distortion and is tied to the development of linear perspective and illusionism in Renaissance Europe. Realism, while predicated upon naturalistic representation and a departure from the idealization of earlier academic art, refers to a specific art historical movement that originated in France in the aftermath of the French Revolution of 1848",
    "With artists like Gustave Courbet capitalizing on the mundane, ugly or sordid, realism was motivated by the renewed interest in the common man and the rise of leftist politics. The Realist painters rejected Romanticism, which had come to dominate French literature and art, with roots in the late 18th century.",
    "In 19th-century Europe, \"Naturalism\" or the \"Naturalist school\" was somewhat artificially erected as a term representing a breakaway sub-movement of realism, that attempted (not wholly successfully) to distinguish itself from its parent by its avoidance of politics and social issues, and liked to proclaim a quasi-scientific basis, playing on the sense of \"naturalist\" as a student of natural history, as the biological sciences were then generally known.",
    "There have been various movements invoking realism in the other arts, such as the opera style of verismo, literary realism, theatrical realism, and Italian neorealist cinema.",
    "Art Deco, short for the French Arts Décoratifs, and sometimes just called Deco, is a style of visual arts, architecture, and product design, that first appeared in France in the 1910s (just before World War I), and flourished in the United States and Europe during the 1920s and 1930s",
    "Through styling and design of the exterior and interior of anything from large structures to small objects, including how people look (clothing, fashion and jewelry), Art Deco has influenced bridges, buildings (from skyscrapers to cinemas), ships, ocean liners, trains, cars, trucks, buses, furniture, and everyday objects like radios and vacuum cleaners.",
    "It got its name after the 1925 Exposition internationale des arts décoratifs et industriels modernes (International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts) held in Paris.",
    "Art Deco combined modern styles with fine craftsmanship and rich materials",
    "During its heyday, it represented luxury, glamour, exuberance, and faith in social and technological progress.",
    "From its outset, Art Deco was influenced by the bold geometric forms of Cubism and the Vienna Secession; the bright colours of Fauvism and of the Ballets Russes; the updated craftsmanship of the furniture of the eras of Louis Philippe I and Louis XVI; and the exoticized styles of China, Japan, India, Persia, ancient Egypt and Maya art",
    "It featured rare and expensive materials, such as ebony and ivory, and exquisite craftsmanship",
    "The Empire State Building, Chrysler Building, and other skyscrapers of New York City built during the 1920s and 1930s are monuments to the style.",
    "In the 1930s, during the Great Depression, Art Deco became more subdued",
    "New materials arrived, including chrome plating, stainless steel and plastic",
    "A sleeker form of the style, called Streamline Moderne, appeared in the 1930s, featuring curving forms and smooth, polished surfaces. Art Deco is one of the first truly international styles, but its dominance ended with the beginning of World War II and the rise of the strictly functional and unadorned styles of modern architecture and the International Style of architecture that followed.",
    "Neo-expressionism is a style of late modernist or early-postmodern painting and sculpture that emerged in the late 1970s",
    "Neo-expressionists were sometimes called Transavantgarde, Junge Wilde or Neue Wilden ('The new wild ones'; 'New Fauves' would better meet the meaning of the term)",
    "It is characterized by intense subjectivity and rough handling of materials.",
    "Neo-expressionism developed as a reaction against conceptual art and minimal art of the 1970s",
    "Neo-expressionists returned to portraying recognizable objects, such as the human body (although sometimes in an abstract manner), in a rough and violently emotional way, often using vivid colors. It was overtly inspired by German Expressionist painters, such as Emil Nolde, Max Beckmann, George Grosz, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, James Ensor and Edvard Munch",
    "It is also related to American Lyrical Abstraction painting of the 1960s and 1970s, The Hairy Who movement in Chicago, the Bay Area Figurative School of the 1950s and 1960s, the continuation of Abstract Expressionism, precedents in Pop Painting, and New Image Painting: a vague late 1970s term applied to painters who employed a strident figurative style with cartoon-like imagery and abrasive handling owing something to Neo-Expressionism",
    "The New Image Painting term was given currency by a 1978 exhibition entitled New Image Painting held at the Whitney Museum.",
    "Folk art  covers all forms of visual art made in the context of folk culture",
    " Definitions vary, but generally the objects have practical utility of some kind, rather than being exclusively decorative",

    "For a European perspective, Edward Lucie-Smith described it as \"Unsophisticated art, both fine and applied, which is supposedly rooted in the collective awareness of simple people",
    " The concept of folk art is a distinctly 19th-century one",
    " Today it carries with it a tinge of nostalgia for pre-industrial society.\"",
    "Folk arts reflect the cultural life of a community",
    "The art form encompasses the expressive culture associated with the fields of folklore and cultural heritage",
    "Tangible folk art can include objects which historically are crafted and used within a traditional community",
    "Intangible folk arts can include such forms as music and art galleries , dance and narrative structures",
    "Each of these art forms, both tangible and intangible, typically were developed to address a practical purpose",
    "Once the purpose has been lost or forgotten, there usually is no reason for further transmission unless the object or action has been imbued with meaning beyond its initial practicality",
    "These artistic traditions are shaped by values and standards that are passed from generation to generation, most often within family and community, through demonstration, conversation, and practice.",
    "Postmodernism is an intellectual stance or mode of discourse characterized by skepticism toward the \"grand narratives\" of modernism, opposition to epistemic certainty or stability of meaning, and emphasis on ideology as a means of maintaining political power. Claims to objective fact are dismissed as naïve realism, with attention drawn to the conditional nature of knowledge claims within particular historical, political, and cultural discourses. The postmodern outlook is characterized by self-referentiality, epistemological relativism, moral relativism, pluralism, irony, irreverence, and eclecticism; it rejects the \"universal validity\" of binary oppositions, stable identity, hierarchy, and categorization.",
    "Initially emerging from a mode of literary criticism, postmodernism developed in the mid-twentieth century as a rejection of modernism and has been observed across many disciplines. Postmodernism is associated with the disciplines deconstruction and post-structuralism. Various authors have criticized postmodernism as promoting obscurantism, as abandoning Enlightenment rationalism and scientific rigor, and as adding nothing to analytical or empirical knowledge.",
    "Kinetic art is art from any medium that contains movement perceivable by the viewer or that depends on motion for its effect",
    "Canvas paintings that extend the viewer's perspective of the artwork and incorporate multidimensional movement are the earliest examples of kinetic art. More pertinently speaking, kinetic art is a term that today most often refers to three-dimensional sculptures and figures such as mobiles that move naturally or are machine operated (see e",

    "There is also a portion of kinetic art that includes virtual movement, or rather movement perceived from only certain angles or sections of the work",
    "This term also clashes frequently with the term \"apparent movement\", which many people use when referring to an artwork whose movement is created by motors, machines, or electrically powered systems",
    "Both apparent and virtual movement are styles of kinetic art that only recently have been argued as styles of op art. The amount of overlap between kinetic and op art is not significant enough for artists and art historians to consider merging the two styles under one umbrella term, but there are distinctions that have yet to be made.",
    "\"Kinetic art\" as a moniker developed from a number of sources",
    "Kinetic art has its origins in the late 19th century impressionist artists such as Claude Monet, Edgar Degas, and Édouard Manet who originally experimented with accentuating the movement of human figures on canvas",
    "This triumvirate of impressionist painters all sought to create art that was more lifelike than their contemporaries",
    "Degas’ dancer and racehorse portraits are examples of what he believed to be \"photographic realism\";. During the late 19th century artists such as Degas felt the need to challenge the movement toward photography with vivid, cadenced landscapes and portraits.",
    "By the early 1900s, certain artists grew closer and closer to ascribing their art to dynamic motion",
    "Naum Gabo, one of the two artists attributed to naming this style, wrote frequently about his work as examples of \"kinetic rhythm\". He felt that his moving sculpture Kinetic Construction (also dubbed Standing Wave, 1919–20) was the first of its kind in the 20th century",
    "From the 1920s until the 1960s, the style of kinetic art was reshaped by a number of other artists who experimented with mobiles and new forms of sculpture.",
    "Constructivism is an early twentieth-century art movement founded in 1915 by Vladimir Tatlin and Alexander Rodchenko. Abstract and austere, constructivist art aimed to reflect modern industrial society and urban space. The movement rejected decorative stylization in  favor of the industrial assemblage of materials. Constructivists were in favour of art for propaganda and social purposes, and were associated with Soviet socialism, the Bolsheviks and the Russian avant-garde.",
    "Constructivist architecture and art had a great effect on modern art movements of the 20th century, influencing major trends such as the Bauhaus and De Stijl movements",

This movement marked the first time an American art style gained global prominence, positioning New York as the new hub of Western art, a distinction once held by Paris.",
    "Did you know that the term \"abstract expressionism\" was originally coined in 1919 Germany to describe German Expressionism in the magazine Der Sturm? Interestingly, it wasn't until 1946 that American art critic Robert Coates brought this dynamic label stateside to characterize the bold new art movement in the U.S. Talk about a global journey for a term that now defines a whole era of artistic rebellion and innovation!",

    "Cubism, an early-20th-century avant-garde art movement, revolutionized European painting, sculpture, and influenced music, literature, and architecture.",
    "Cubist art involves analyzing, breaking up, and reassembling objects in an abstract form. Rather than presenting objects from one perspective, it portrays them from multiple viewpoints to provide a more comprehensive context. Cubism is regarded as the most influential art movement of the 20th century. The term encompasses a broad range of art created in Paris (Montmartre and Montparnasse) or nearby (Puteaux) during the 1910s and 1920s.",
    "The movement was pioneered by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque, with contributions from Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Robert Delaunay, Henri Le Fauconnier, Juan Gris, and Fernand Léger. One primary influence on Cubism was the representation of three-dimensional form in the later works of Paul Cézanne. A retrospective of Cézanne's paintings was held at the Salon d'Automne in 1904, and his current works were displayed at the 1905 and 1906 Salon d'Automne. Following his death in 1906, two commemorative retrospectives were held in 1907.",
    "In France, Cubism inspired movements like Orphism, abstract art, and Purism, with a far-reaching impact.",
    "In France and other countries, movements like Futurism, Suprematism, Dada, Constructivism, Vorticism, De Stijl, and Art Deco emerged as reactions to Cubism.",
    "Early Futurist paintings share similarities with Cubism, such as combining past and present elements and depicting multiple perspectives of a subject either simultaneously or sequentially, known as multiple perspective, simultaneity, or multiplicity. Constructivism was inspired by Picasso's method of creating sculptures from individual parts. Both movements also feature common themes including the simplification or faceting of geometric shapes, and a linkage to mechanization and contemporary life.",
    "Surrealism is a cultural movement that emerged in Europe after World War I, characterized by artists creating bizarre, illogical scenes and utilizing techniques to express the unconscious mind. Led by André Breton, the movement sought to \"resolve the previously contradictory conditions of dream and reality into an absolute reality, a super-reality,\" or surreality. It significantly influenced painting, literature, theater, film, photography, and various other forms of art.",
    "Surrealist works feature surprise, unexpected juxtapositions, and non sequiturs.",
    "However, many Surrealist artists and writers view their creations primarily as a manifestation of a deeper philosophical movement—an embodiment of \"pure psychic automatism\" as described by Breton in the first Surrealist Manifesto—while considering the artworks themselves as secondary.",
    "Artifacts of surrealist experimentation highlight the revolutionary nature of the movement, a point explicitly asserted by its leader, Breton.",
    "The movement was linked to political causes like communism and anarchism.",
    "Inspired by the revolutionary spirit of the Dada movement of the 1910s.",
    "The word \"Surrealism\" was first used by Guillaume Apollinaire in 1917. Nonetheless, the Surrealist movement wasn't formally recognized until after October 1924. This happened when French poet and critic André Breton's publication of the Surrealist Manifesto effectively established his group's claim to the term, overshadowing a competing manifesto by Yvan Goll that had come out just two weeks earlier. Paris, France, became the central hub for the movement.",

    "Renaissance art, a vibrant fusion of painting, sculpture, architecture, music, and literature, flourished in Europe during the 14th, 15th, and 16th centuries. This artistic explosion was fueled by a heightened appreciation of nature, a resurgence of classical knowledge, and a newfound focus on individualism.",

    "Originating as a response to World War I, the Dada movement included artists who opposed the logic, reason, and aesthetic values of contemporary capitalist society. Instead, they infused their works with elements of nonsense, irrationality, and anti-bourgeois sentiment.

    "Marcel Duchamp coined the term anti-art around 1913 to describe works challenging traditional art definitions, paving the way for Dada. Influenced by Cubism, collage, and abstract art, the movement emphasized a break from reality and convention.",
    "The rebellious spirit of French poets, Italian Futurists, and German Expressionists ignited Dada's defiance against the conventional ties between words and meaning. Groundbreaking works like Alfred Jarry's *Ubu Roi* (1896) and Erik Satie's avant-garde ballet *Parade* (1916–17) emerged as early harbingers of the Dadaist revolution. Hugo Ball's poignant *Dada Manifesto* in 1916 would soon encapsulate the essence of this radical movement, forever altering the landscape of modern art and literature.",
    "The Dadaist movement was all about getting together for public events, putting on demos, and publishing cool art and literary magazines. They were super passionate about art, politics, and culture, and loved chatting about these topics through all kinds of media.",

The Neo-Impressionists revolutionized contemporary art with their groundbreaking interpretations of lines and colors. At the heart of this art movement were the dazzling Pointillist and Divisionist techniques, which dominated the scene from the very start. These techniques weren't just popular—they were the heartbeat of the early Neo-Impressionist explosion! 🌟🎨",
    "Some contend that Neo-Impressionism emerged as the pioneering avant-garde movement in painting. The Neo-Impressionists rapidly established their influence in the 19th century, thanks in part to a close association with anarchism, which influenced the tempo of subsequent artistic developments. Their style sought to derive a \"harmonious\" vision from modern science, anarchist theory, and contemporary debates on the merit of academic art.",

    "The principal figures at the forefront of this movement were notable Italians such as Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, Umberto Boccioni, Carlo Carrà, Fortunato Depero, Gino Severini, Giacomo Balla, and Luigi Russolo.",
    "Italian Futurism celebrated the wonders of modernity and sought to unshackle Italy from the burdens of its historical legacy. Influential Futurist masterpieces included Marinetti's groundbreaking *Manifesto of Futurism* (1909), Boccioni's dynamic sculpture *Unique Forms of Continuity in Space* (1913), Balla's vibrant painting *Abstract Speed + Sound* (1913–1914), and Russolo's avant-garde piece *The Art of Noises* (1913).",
    "While Futurism predominantly originated in Italy, concurrent movements also appeared in Russia, with several Russian Futurists eventually establishing their own groups; in other nations, there were either a handful of Futurists or movements that took inspiration from Futurism.",

    "It gained popularity between 1890 and 1910 during the Belle Époque period as a reaction against the academic art, eclecticism, and historicism that characterized 19th-century architecture and decoration.",
    "Art Nouveau frequently drew inspiration from the graceful curves of plants and flowers. Its hallmarks included a dynamic sense of movement, typically achieved through asymmetry or flowing, whiplash lines. The style also embraced modern materials like iron, glass, ceramics, and later concrete, allowing for unique shapes and expansive open areas.",
    "A key aim of Art Nouveau was to dissolve the conventional separation between fine arts, like painting and sculpture, and applied arts.",
    "You could find it everywhere - in home decor, graphic design, furniture, glass art, clothing, ceramics, jewelry, and even metal work.",
    "The style was a reaction to prominent 19th-century thinkers, including French architect Eugène-Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc (1814–1879) and British art critic John Ruskin (1819–1900).",

It enjoyed a spectacular revival in the late 1960s, culminating in a blockbuster exhibition of Hector Guimard's work at the Museum of Modern Art in 1970, capturing the critics' attention and hearts all over again.",
    "Romanticism, an artistic, literary, musical, and intellectual movement, originated in late 18th-century Europe and peaked from 1800 to 1850.",
    "Romanticism was characterized by its emphasis on emotion and individualism, the presence of clandestine literature, the idealization of nature, skepticism towards science and industrialization, and the glorification of the past, with a marked preference for the medieval era over the classical. This movement partly emerged as a reaction to the Industrial Revolution, the social and political norms of the Age of Enlightenment, and the scientific rationalization of nature. Romanticism found its most potent expression in the visual arts, music, and literature, but it also significantly influenced historiography, education, chess, social sciences, and the natural sciences. The movement had a profound and multifaceted impact on politics, with romantic thinkers shaping conservatism, liberalism, radicalism, and nationalism.",
    "The movement highlighted strong feelings as a genuine source of artistic experience, focusing on emotions like fear, horror, terror, and awe, particularly when faced with the new aesthetic concepts of the sublime and natural beauty. It raised folk art and ancient traditions to a noble status and valued spontaneity as an appealing trait, much like in a musical impromptu.",
    "Unlike the rationalism and classicism of the Enlightenment, Romanticism brought back medieval elements and art forms, aiming to avoid the challenges of population growth, early urbanization, and industrialization.",
    "Rooted in the German Sturm und Drang movement, which championed intuition and emotion over Enlightenment rationalism, Romanticism was also deeply influenced by the transformative events and ideologies of the French Revolution. Many early Romantics were cultural revolutionaries themselves, drawn to the passionate upheavals of the era. This movement celebrated \"heroic\" individualists and visionary artists, believing that their remarkable achievements could elevate and inspire society as a whole.",
    "It also encouraged people to use their imagination freely instead of sticking to the old rules about how art should look.",
    "The depiction of its ideas heavily relied on a sense of historical and natural inevitability, embodying the spirit of the times.",
    "During the latter part of the 19th century, Realism emerged as a stark contrast to Romanticism. The waning of Romanticism in this era was linked to various developments, including shifts in social and political landscapes.",
    "Minimalism is all about highlighting the core essence of a subject by stripping away anything unnecessary, whether it's in art, design, or music. The goal is to focus on what's truly essential, letting the core idea or features shine through without any extra clutter.",

    "Artists sometimes push back against being called minimalists because it can make their work sound too simple. People often see minimalism as a response to abstract expressionism and a link to postminimal art styles.",
    "Impressionism, a 19th-century art movement, is distinguished by small, thin, yet visible brush strokes, open composition, a focus on accurately portraying light and its changing qualities (highlighting the effects of time), ordinary subjects, unique visual angles, and the incorporation of movement as a fundamental aspect of human perception and experience.",
    "Impressionism burst onto the scene thanks to a group of visionary Paris-based artists, whose bold, independent exhibitions catapulted them to fame in the 1870s and 1880s.",
    "The Impressionists faced strong resistance from the traditional art community in France.",
    "The style's name comes from Claude Monet's painting \"Impression, Sunrise.\" This piece inspired critic Louis Leroy to coin the term in a satirical review published in the Parisian newspaper Le Charivari.",
    "After Impressionism took off in the visual arts, similar styles quickly popped up in music and literature, and we started calling them impressionist music and impressionist literature.",
    "Post-Impressionism was a French art movement from 1886 to 1905, between the last Impressionist exhibition and the emergence of Fauvism.",
    "Post-Impressionism arose in response to the Impressionists' focus on depicting light and color naturalistically.",
    "Post-Impressionism captures a diverse range of styles, from the abstract and symbolic qualities of Les Nabis, Neo-Impressionism, and Symbolism to the distinctive techniques of Cloisonnism, the Pont-Aven School, and Synthetism, as well as the evolving works of some later Impressionists.",
    "Key figures of the movement included Paul Cézanne, often referred to as the progenitor of Post-Impressionism, alongside Paul Gauguin, Vincent van Gogh, and Georges Seurat.",
    "The term \"Post-Impressionism\" was first introduced by art critic Roger Fry in 1906. In a review of the Salon d'Automne published on October 15, 1910, in Art News, critic Frank Rutter described Othon Friesz as a \"post-impressionist leader.\" An advertisement for the exhibition \"The Post-Impressionists of France\" also appeared at that time. Three weeks later, Roger Fry used the term again when he organized the 1910 exhibition \"Manet and the Post-Impressionists,\" defining it as the evolution of French art since Manet.",
    "Post-Impressionists built on Impressionism, using vivid colors and painting from life, but they emphasized geometric forms, expressive distortions, and modified or unnatural colors.",
    "Conceptual art, or conceptualism, prioritizes the ideas behind the work over traditional aesthetic, technical, and material aspects.",
    "Some works of conceptual art, often called installations, can be created by anyone who follows written instructions. This approach was central to American artist Sol LeWitt's definition of conceptual art, which was one of the first to be published.",
    "Tony Godfrey, in his 1998 book *Conceptual Art (Art & Ideas)*, contends that conceptual art fundamentally challenges the essence of what art is. This provocative idea was taken to new heights by Joseph Kosuth, who in his groundbreaking 1969 manifesto *Art after Philosophy*, redefined art itself according to this radical perspective.",
    "Art examining its own nature was central to critic Clement Greenberg's vision of Modern art in the 1950s.",
    "In the 1960s, conceptual artists like Art & Language, Joseph Kosuth (the American editor of Art-Language), and Lawrence Weiner started a much deeper examination of art using solely language-based methods.",
    "One of the first and most important things they questioned was the common belief that an artist's job was to make special kinds of physical objects.",
    "In the 1990s, when the Young British Artists and the Turner Prize were making waves, the term \"conceptual art\" started gaining traction, especially in the UK. People began using it to describe just about any modern art that strayed from classic painting and sculpture techniques. But here's the twist: the very meaning of \"conceptual art\" has always been a bit of a puzzle. This murkiness is why the term now covers so many different and unexpected creative practices, far beyond its original intent.",
    "As the artist Mel Bochner suggested as early as 1970, in elucidating his aversion to the epithet \"conceptual,\" the term \"concept\" is not always precisely defined and is at risk of being conflated with \"intention.\"",
    "When describing or defining a work of art as conceptual, it is crucial not to confuse the term \"conceptual\" with the artist's \"intention\".",
    "Gothic art developed in 12th-century Northern France from Romanesque art, alongside Gothic architecture.",
    "It spread like wildfire across all of Western Europe, igniting excitement throughout Northern, Southern, and Central Europe, while still beautifully preserving the timeless classical styles in Italy!",
    "In the late 14th century, the dazzling and refined International Gothic court style emerged, setting the stage for a captivating artistic evolution that thrived through to the late 15th century.",
    "In various regions, particularly in Germany, the allure of Late Gothic art lingered deep into the 16th century, casting its enchanting spell before gradually merging with the emerging brilliance of Renaissance art.",
    "During the Gothic period, artists worked with a variety of delightful media like sculpture, panel painting, stained glass, fresco, and charming illuminated manuscripts.",
    "The distinct transitions in architecture from Romanesque to Gothic, and then from Gothic to Renaissance styles, often serve to delineate periods in art across various media, even though figurative art evolved at a different rate in many respects.",
    "The first Gothic art emerged as grandiose sculptures adorning the walls of cathedrals and abbeys.",
    "Christian art frequently adopted a typological approach, as seen in Medieval allegory, by juxtaposing stories from the New Testament and the Old Testament.",
    "The depictions of the Virgin Mary evolved from the traditional Byzantine iconography to a more tender and relatable motherly figure, cradling her child, carrying him on her hip, and exuding the elegance and grace of an esteemed noblewoman.",
    "Secular art flourished during this period, marked by the emergence of urban centers, the foundation of universities, increased trade, the establishment of a monetary economy, and the rise of a bourgeois class capable of patronizing the arts and commissioning works. This confluence of factors culminated in a significant proliferation of paintings and illuminated manuscripts.",
    "Rising literacy rates and an expanding collection of secular vernacular literature promoted the depiction of secular themes in art.",
    "As cities flourished, the formation of trade guilds became essential, and being part of a painters' guild was not just an option but a crucial step for artists. These guilds provided indispensable support, resources, and opportunities, helping artists to develop their skills, gain recognition, and secure significant commissions. Joining a guild elevated an artist's status and enhanced their credibility, making it a vital move for anyone serious about their craft.",
    "Thanks to better record-keeping, more artists from this period are known by name than ever before—some were even bold enough to sign their works!",
    "Rococo (/rəˈkoʊkoʊ/, also US: /ˌroʊkəˈkoʊ/), sometimes known as Late Baroque or Roccoco, is an extravagantly decorative and theatrical style of architecture, art, and decoration. It features a blend of asymmetry, scrolling curves, gilding, white and pastel colors, sculpted mouldings, and trompe-l'œil frescoes, all designed to evoke surprise and create the illusion of motion and drama.",
    "It is frequently referred to as the ultimate manifestation of the Baroque movement.",
    "The Rococo style emerged in France during the 1730s as a response to the more formal and geometric Louis XIV style.",
    "Referred to as the \"Rocaille style,\" this artistic movement quickly extended its influence across Europe, especially to northern Italy, Austria, southern Germany, Central Europe, and Russia. It also impacted various other forms of art, such as sculpture, furniture, silverware, glassware, painting, music, and theater. Initially a secular style designed mainly for the interiors of private homes, Rococo also had a spiritual dimension that made it popular for decorating church interiors, particularly in Central Europe, Portugal, and South America.",
    "Realism in the arts usually strives to depict subjects accurately, steering clear of artificiality and refraining from imaginative fiction and mystical aspects.",
    "The term is frequently used as a synonym for naturalism, although the two concepts are not identical.",
    "In Western art, the idea of naturalism aims to represent objects with minimal distortion and is closely linked to the evolution of linear perspective and illusionism during the Renaissance in Europe. On the other hand, realism is rooted in naturalistic depiction but marks a shift away from the idealization seen in earlier academic art. This specific art movement emerged in France following the French Revolution of 1848.",
    "With artists such as Gustave Courbet embracing the ordinary, the unattractive, or the sordid aspects of life, the movement of Realism was driven by a revitalized focus on the everyday individual and the emergence of left-wing political ideologies. The Realist painters turned away from the ideals of Romanticism, a movement that had taken a commanding position in French literature and art since its origins in the late 18th century.",
    "In 19th-century Europe, \"Naturalism\" or the \"Naturalist school\" emerged as a sub-movement of Realism. It sought to differentiate itself by steering clear of politics and social issues. This movement claimed a quasi-scientific foundation, drawing on the term \"naturalist\" as it was used to describe students of natural history, aligning with the biological sciences of that era.",
    "Various movements have invoked realism in the arts, including verismo opera, literary realism, theatrical realism, and Italian neorealist cinema.",
    "Art Deco, also known as Deco and short for the French Arts Décoratifs, burst onto the scene in France during the 1910s, just before World War I. This vibrant style of visual arts, architecture, and product design reached its peak of popularity in the United States and Europe throughout the roaring 1920s and 1930s.",
    "Art Deco has influenced the design and styling of everything from large structures like bridges and skyscrapers to everyday objects like radios and vacuum cleaners, as well as clothing, fashion, and jewelry.",
    "The name was derived from the 1925 Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes, an illustrious exhibition of modern decorative and industrial arts held in Paris.",
    "Art Deco fused contemporary designs with exquisite artistry and opulent materials.",
    "In its prime, it stood for luxury, excitement, and a belief in a brighter, more advanced future.",
    "From the very beginning, Art Deco has drawn inspiration from the adventurous geometric shapes of Cubism and the Vienna Secession, the vibrant colors of Fauvism and the Ballets Russes, the refined craftsmanship of furniture from the eras of Louis Philippe I and Louis XVI, as well as the fascinating, exotic styles of China, Japan, India, Persia, ancient Egypt, and Maya art.",
    "It showcased luxurious materials like ebony and ivory, along with exceptional artistry.",
    "The Empire State Building, Chrysler Building, and various other high-rises of New York City constructed in the 1920s and 1930s are tributes to the design.",
    "In the 1930s, amidst the Great Depression, Art Deco style became more restrained.",
    "New materials arrived, such as chrome plating, stainless steel, and plastic.",
    "A sleeker variant, Streamline Moderne, emerged in the 1930s with curving forms and polished surfaces. Art Deco, one of the first international styles, lost prominence with World War II's onset, giving way to functional modern architecture and the International Style.",
    "Neo-expressionism is a distinctive style of late modernist or early postmodern painting and sculpture that emerged in the late 1970s.",
    "Neo-expressionists were sometimes referred to as Transavantgarde, Junge Wilde, or Neue Wilden ('The New Wild Ones'; a closer translation would be 'New Fauves').",
    "Characterized by intense subjectivity and rough handling of materials.",
    "Neo-expressionism emerged in response to the conceptual and minimal art of the 1970s.",
    "Neo-expressionists made an exhilarating return to portraying recognizable objects, like the human body (even if in an abstract manner), in a bold and passionately emotional way. They used vivid colors that truly burst off the canvas! This movement took major inspiration from the dynamic world of German Expressionist painters, including the vibrant works of Emil Nolde, Max Beckmann, George Grosz, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, James Ensor, and Edvard Munch.",
    "It's also tied to the vibrant American Lyrical Abstraction painting of the '60s and '70s, the bold Hairy Who movement in Chicago, the dynamic Bay Area Figurative School of the '50s and '60s, the relentless evolution of Abstract Expressionism, the innovative precedents in Pop Painting, and the energetic New Image Painting—a dynamic late '70s movement where artists unleashed a striking figurative style with cartoon-like imagery and an unapologetically abrasive flair that echoed Neo-Expressionism.",
    "The term \"New Image Painting\" really caught on after a 1978 exhibition called New Image Painting at the Whitney Museum.",
    "Folk art encompasses all forms of visual expression created within the framework of folk culture.",
    "Definitions vary, but generally, the objects serve a practical purpose beyond mere decoration.",
    "Folk artists are usually educated within a widespread tradition, as opposed to the fine art tradition of their culture.",
    "There is frequently overlap or disputed territory with 'naive art.'",
    "\"Folk art\" bursts with life and vibrancy, distinct from the captivating creations of traditional societies where ethnographic art thrives continuously.",
    "The term \"folk art\" encompasses a wide array of objects, each distinct in its expression and cultural significance.",
    "\"understood through its use in Europe, where the term first appeared, and in the United States, where it evolved in quite a different way.\"",
    "From a European viewpoint, Edward Lucie-Smith characterized it as \"Art, both fine and applied, that is considered unrefined and originates from the collective consciousness of humble folks.\"",
    "The notion of folk art is uniquely a product of the 19th century.",
    "Nowadays, it evokes a sense of longing for a pre-industrial era.",
    "Folk arts showcase the cultural life of a community.",
    "The art form encompasses the expressive culture associated with the domains of folklore and cultural heritage.",
    "Tangible folk art includes traditionally crafted community objects.",
    "Intangible folk arts can encompass various forms, including music, dance, narrative structures, and art galleries.",
    "Each of these art forms, whether tangible or intangible, has been brilliantly crafted to serve a practical purpose!",
    "When the purpose is lost or forgotten, further transmission is pointless unless the object or action has gained additional meaning.",
    "These artistic traditions are shaped by values and standards handed down from generation to generation, primarily within families and communities, through demonstration, conversation, and practice.",
    "Postmodernism is an intellectual stance marked by skepticism towards the \"grand narratives\" of modernism, rejecting the certainty or stability of meaning, and highlighting ideology as a tool for maintaining political power. It dismisses claims to objective facts as naïve realism, focusing instead on the conditional nature of knowledge within specific historical, political, and cultural contexts. The postmodern perspective features self-referentiality, epistemological and moral relativism, pluralism, irony, irreverence, and eclecticism, and it rejects the \"universal validity\" of binary oppositions, stable identities, hierarchies, and categorization.",
    "Originating from literary criticism, postmodernism revolutionized the mid-twentieth century by challenging modernist ideals and permeating numerous disciplines. It is closely linked with deconstruction and post-structuralism, fostering bold new ways of thinking. Though some critics argue that postmodernism cultivates obscurity, dismisses Enlightenment rationalism, and neglects scientific rigor, its influence has undeniably reshaped intellectual landscapes and sparked dynamic debate in both analytical and empirical realms.",
    "Kinetic art involves any medium that incorporates visible movement or relies on motion to create its impact.",
    "Canvas paintings that stretch the viewer's perception and infuse multidimensional motion represent the dawn of kinetic art. Today, when we talk about kinetic art, we typically refer to captivating three-dimensional sculptures and figures like mobiles, which enchant the senses by moving gracefully on their own or with the aid of machinery.",
    "Videos on this page feature the works of George Rickey, Uli Aschenborn, and Sarnikoff.",
    "The moving parts usually spring to life with the help of wind, an electric motor, or even the curious observer!",
    "Kinetic art encompasses a diverse array of interwoven techniques and styles.",
    "A portion of kinetic art includes virtual movement, which is visible only from certain angles or sections of the work.",
    "This term often overlaps with \"apparent movement,\" which many use to describe artwork driven by motors, machines, or electrical systems.",
    "Both apparent and virtual movement represent fascinating styles of kinetic art that have recently sparked debates about their classification within the realm of op art. While the overlap between kinetic and op art isn't substantial enough to merge them under a single umbrella term, intriguing distinctions remain to be fully explored and defined by artists and art historians alike.",
    "The term \"Kinetic art\" emerged from a rich tapestry of influences, making it a powerful and dynamic descriptor for this innovative art form.",
    "Kinetic art traces its origins to the late 19th century, influenced by the Impressionist painters Claude Monet, Edgar Degas, and Édouard Manet, who initially explored the enhancement of human movement in their canvases.",
    "These three impressionist painters aimed to produce art that felt more real compared to their peers.",
    "Edgar Degas’ portraits of dancers and racehorses exemplify his concept of \"photographic realism.\" In the late 19th century, artists like Degas sought to counter the rise of photography by creating vibrant, rhythmically composed landscapes and portraits.",
    "By the early 1900s, many artists became increasingly captivated by infusing their work with dynamic motion.",
    "Naum Gabo, a pioneering artist who co-coined the name for this style, passionately championed his work as prime examples of \"kinetic rhythm.\" He ardently believed that his revolutionary moving sculpture, Kinetic Construction (also known as Standing Wave, 1919–20), was the groundbreaking first of its kind in the 20th century.",
    "From the 1920s to the 1960s, visionary artists revolutionized kinetic art, boldly experimenting with mobiles and pioneering new sculptural forms.",
    "Constructivism burst onto the art scene in the early 20th century, thanks to the visionary minds of Vladimir Tatlin and Alexander Rodchenko in 1915. This movement, known for its abstract and stripped-down aesthetics, sought to mirror the buzz and grit of modern industrial life and bustling urban spaces. It threw out fancy decorations in favor of raw, industrial materials, making a bold statement that art should serve a purpose beyond beauty. Embracing the spirit of Soviet socialism, the Constructivists championed art as a tool for propaganda and societal change, aligning themselves with the Bolsheviks and the Russian avant-garde.",
    "Constructivist architecture and art profoundly shaped the artistic landscape of the 20th century, sparking influential movements like Bauhaus and De Stijl.",
    "Its influence was far-reaching, significantly impacting architecture, sculpture, graphic and industrial design, theatre, film, dance, fashion, and even music to some extent.",
    "Performance art is a form of artwork or an art exhibition that is brought to life through actions carried out by the artist or other participants."
