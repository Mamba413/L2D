This led to a 24% decrease in business travel in 2018 compared to 2017, with the same lower level maintained in 2019 due to enhanced company-wide communication efficiency. This reduction is particularly beneficial as most of our travel involves carbon-intensive airline trips, including transatlantic flights.\n\nWe have also adopted electronic filing, resulting in a 30% reduction in paper usage in 2017 compared to the previous year. This trend has continued, with 2019 showing even lower paper consumption, amounting to a cumulative reduction of about 50% over time.\n\nImprovements in office layout, including updated corporate standards and recent renovations, have led to a 40% reduction in office space per employee. These changes, along with the increased efficiency of conference room space, contribute to less energy consumption. While these updates are not yet fully implemented across all offices, they are being gradually introduced during ongoing changes.\n\nIn addition to these efforts, we encourage environmentally friendly practices such as proper disposal of paper records, placement of recycling receptacles in offices and common areas, and encouraging employees to recycle glass, cans, plastic, and paper. Toner cartridges, light bulbs, and computers are recycled, and energy-saving measures such as automatic light switches are installed. Employees are urged to use mass transit where available, telecommute when feasible, and adopt scanning practices to reduce reliance on paper documents. The company also provides electronic payment options to customers to reduce mail volume.",
    "We've added state-of-the-art telepresence video conference rooms to our main offices and equipped individual desks with video conferencing phones for more dynamic communication. Thanks to these upgrades, our business travel decreased by 33% in 2020 compared to 2019, a change we've sustained by optimizing communication within the company. This achievement is particularly significant as most of our travel involved long-haul flights, contributing to a notable reduction in our carbon footprint.\n\nIn addition, we've transitioned towards electronic filing, leading to a 45% decrease in paper usage for 2020. This was the first step in an ongoing process that we expected would lead to continued reductions, which have indeed materialized, with 2020 marking a cumulative reduction of about 50%.\n\nFurthermore, we've revamped our office layout and corporate standards to enhance space efficiency. Recent renovations have resulted in a 40% decrease in office space per employee through more efficient standards and conference room layouts, further supporting our energy-saving goals. While this initiative is still ongoing, we are progressively implementing changes across our offices.\n\nBesides these key initiatives, we've instigated several environmental measures such as secure disposal of paper records, recycling initiatives with bins placed throughout our offices, and encouraging recycling of glass, cans, plastic, and paper products. Toner cartridges from printers and copiers are recycled, and energy-saving practices like automatic on/off light switches have been implemented. We advocate the use of mass transit and telecommuting, employ high-efficiency light bulbs, encourage employees to power down computers when not in use, and have established scanning procedures to reduce paper usage.

    "Summarize the current or expected risks that climate change may bring to your company, explaining how these risks could impact your business and identifying the geographical areas that may be affected. Transition Risk Case Study: The most impactful risk on company operations thus far has been regarding its reputation with increased stakeholder concern or negative feedback. This rise in stakeholder communication has prompted Lincoln to establish an Office of Corporate Responsibility, report to CDP, and publish a CSR report on the company website. The number of stakeholder inquiries related to climate change's impact on Lincoln and its management practices has risen in recent years. Lincoln's CSR team addresses these inquiries at quarterly Sustainability Advisory Group meetings and regularly with internal business unit leaders and other relevant stakeholders. To proactively respond to growing interest, Lincoln has released a CSR report detailing its approach to managing issues like the integration of ESG considerations, progress on GHG targets, and business continuity planning. Physical Risk Case Study: Extreme weather events such as tornadoes, hurricanes, and floods could affect Lincoln's facilities and workforce. To assess potential impacts, Lincoln considers various scenarios during continuous business impact analysis. Specialized incident management teams within facilities, business, and technology areas led by subject matter experts are in place to handle severe events. In such instances, these teams provide vital information to a dedicated crisis management team, utilizing situational awareness tools and data from local teams for tracking and response. An emergency notification and crisis management tool keep teams informed and engaged during events. Using Hurricane Isaias as a recent example, Lincoln began monitoring the storm and its potential impact a week before its occurrence. Enhanced reporting now considers dispersed risks due to a significant portion of staff working remotely. Additionally, the company can monitor alternative locations for large employee gatherings, reducing the risk of being unaware of incidents in areas with a concentration of employees, often key decision-makers.",
    "The Tokio Marine Group has nationwide presence, making all of its offices vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. For example, climate change poses the risk of increasing wildfires in the Western regions, intensifying the frequency and severity of hurricanes affecting the East Coast and Gulf of Mexico, amplifying the threat of flooding in the East Coast and Midwest areas, and boosting the occurrence of tornadoes and other convective storms in the Midwest and Southeast. The group has robust business continuity plans that are regularly updated and tested to ensure preparedness for potential climate-related disruptions.\n\nIn the face of climate change, the financial performance of the companies within the Tokio Marine Group could be adversely affected by a rise in catastrophic events leading to widespread property and casualty losses. As insurers operating nationwide, the insureds of the Tokio Marine Group face exposure to various weather-related risks, including hurricanes, wildfires, flooding, and severe convective storms. The increased frequency and severity of these events due to climate change can complicate the determination of premium rates, setting up adequate reserves, and securing reinsurance arrangements.\n\nThe surge in the frequency and severity of North Atlantic Hurricanes, along with the subsequent devastating impacts on coastal areas, is a major concern. Hurricanes alone are responsible for about 70% of all wind losses in North America, and coastal storms, such as hurricanes, tropical storms, sub-tropical storms, and Nor'easters, affect regions spanning from Texas to Maine. By utilizing tools mentioned previously and conducting focused research on the potential effects of climate change on hurricanes, the Tokio Marine Group aims to enhance its management of hurricane and other catastrophe exposures.",
