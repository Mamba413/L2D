    "I have bought several of the Vitality canned dog food products and have found them all to be of good quality. The product looks more like a stew than a processed meat and it smells better. My Labrador is finicky and she appreciates this product better than  most.",
    "Product arrived labeled as Jumbo Salted Peanuts...the peanuts were actually small sized unsalted. Not sure if this was an error or if the vendor intended to represent the product as \"Jumbo\".",
    "This is a confection that has been around a few centuries.  It is a light, pillowy citrus gelatin with nuts - in this case Filberts. And it is cut into tiny squares and then liberally coated with powdered sugar.  And it is a tiny mouthful of heaven.  Not too chewy, and very flavorful.  I highly recommend this yummy treat.  If you are familiar with the story of C.S. Lewis' \"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe\" - this is the treat that seduces Edmund into selling out his Brother and Sisters to the Witch.",
    "If you are looking for the secret ingredient in Robitussin I believe I have found it.  I got this in addition to the Root Beer Extract I ordered (which was good) and made some cherry soda.  The flavor is very medicinal.",
    "Great taffy at a great price.  There was a wide assortment of yummy taffy.  Delivery was very quick.  If your a taffy lover, this is a deal.",
    "I got a wild hair for taffy and ordered this five pound bag. The taffy was all very enjoyable with many flavors: watermelon, root beer, melon, peppermint, grape, etc. My only complaint is there was a bit too much red/black licorice-flavored pieces (just not my particular favorites). Between me, my kids, and my husband, this lasted only two weeks! I would recommend this brand of taffy -- it was a delightful treat.",
    "This saltwater taffy had great flavors and was very soft and chewy.  Each candy was individually wrapped well.  None of the candies were stuck together, which did happen in the expensive version, Fralinger's.  Would highly recommend this candy!  I served it at a beach-themed party and everyone loved it!",
    "This taffy is so good.  It is very soft and chewy.  The flavors are amazing.  I would definitely recommend you buying it.  Very satisfying!!",
    "Right now I'm mostly just sprouting this so my cats can eat the grass. They love it. I rotate it around with Wheatgrass and Rye too",
    "This is a very healthy dog food. Good for their digestion. Also good for small puppies. My dog eats her required amount at every feeding.",
    "I don't know if it's the cactus or the tequila or just the unique combination of ingredients, but the flavour of this hot sauce makes it one of a kind!  We picked up a bottle once on a trip we were on and brought it back home with us and were totally blown away!  When we realized that we simply couldn't find it anywhere in our city we were bummed.<br /><br />Now, because of the magic of the internet, we have a case of the sauce and are ecstatic because of it.<br /><br />If you love hot sauce..I mean really love hot sauce, but don't want a sauce that tastelessly burns your throat, grab a bottle of Tequila Picante Gourmet de Inclan.  Just realize that once you taste it, you will never want to use any other sauce.<br /><br />Thank you for the personal, incredible service!",
    "One of my boys needed to lose some weight and the other didn't.  I put this food on the floor for the chubby guy, and the protein-rich, no by-product food up higher where only my skinny boy can jump.  The higher food sits going stale.  They both really go for this food.  And my chubby boy has been losing about an ounce a week.",
    "My cats have been happily eating Felidae Platinum for more than two years. I just got a new bag and the shape of the food is different. They tried the new food when I first put it in their bowls and now the bowls sit full and the kitties will not touch the food. I've noticed similar reviews related to formula changes in the past. Unfortunately, I now need to find a new food that my cats will eat.",
    "good flavor! these came securely packed... they were fresh and delicious! i love these Twizzlers!",
    "The Strawberry Twizzlers are my guilty pleasure - yummy. Six pounds will be around for a while with my son and I.",
    "My daughter loves twizzlers and this shipment of six pounds really hit the spot. It's exactly what you would expect...six packages of strawberry twizzlers.",
    "I love eating them and they are good for watching TV and looking at movies! It is not too sweet. I like to transfer them to a zip lock baggie so they stay fresh so I can take my time eating them.",
    "I am very satisfied with my Twizzler purchase.  I shared these with others and we have all enjoyed them.  I will definitely be ordering more.",
    "Twizzlers, Strawberry my childhood favorite candy, made in Lancaster Pennsylvania by Y & S Candies, Inc. one of the oldest confectionery Firms in the United States, now a Subsidiary of the Hershey Company, the Company was established in 1845 as Young and Smylie, they also make Apple Licorice Twists, Green Color and Blue Raspberry Licorice Twists, I like them all<br /><br />I keep it in a dry cool place because is not recommended it to put it in the fridge. According to the Guinness Book of Records, the longest Licorice Twist ever made measured 1.200 Feet (370 M) and weighted 100 Pounds (45 Kg) and was made by Y & S Candies, Inc. This Record-Breaking Twist became a Guinness World Record on July 19, 1998. This Product is Kosher! Thank You",
    "Candy was delivered very fast and was purchased at a reasonable price.  I was home bound and unable to get to a store so this was perfect for me.",
    "My husband is a Twizzlers addict.  We've bought these many times from Amazon because we're government employees living overseas and can't get them in the country we are assigned to.  They've always been fresh and tasty, packed well and arrive in a timely manner.",
    "I bought these for my husband who is currently overseas. He loves these, and apparently his staff likes them also.<br />There are generous amounts of Twizzlers in each 16-ounce bag, and this was well worth the price. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GVISJM\">Twizzlers, Strawberry, 16-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)</a>",
    "I can remember buying this candy as a kid and the quality hasn't dropped in all these years. Still a superb product you won't be disappointed with.",
    "I have lived out of the US for over 7 yrs now, and I so miss my Twizzlers!!  When I go back to visit or someone visits me, I always stock up.  All I can say is YUM!<br />Sell these in Mexico and you will have a faithful buyer, more often than I'm able to buy them right now.",

    "The candy is just red , No flavor . Just  plan and chewy .  I would never buy them again",
    "I was so glad Amazon carried these batteries.  I have a hard time finding them elsewhere because they are such a unique size.  I need them for my garage door opener.<br />Great deal for the price.",
    "I got this for my Mum who is not diabetic but needs to watch her sugar intake, and my father who simply chooses to limit unnecessary sugar intake - she's the one with the sweet tooth - they both LOVED these toffees, you would never guess that they're sugar-free and it's so great that you can eat them pretty much guilt free!  i was so impressed that i've ordered some for myself (w dark chocolate) to take to the office so i'll eat them instead of snacking on sugary sweets.<br />These are just EXCELLENT!",

    "I have never been a huge coffee fan. However, my mother purchased this little machine and talked me into trying the Latte Macciato. No Coffee Shop has a better one and I like most of the other products, too (as a usually non-coffee drinker!).<br />The little Dolche Guesto Machine is super easy to use and prepares a really good Coffee/Latte/Cappuccino/etc in less than a minute (if water is heated up). I would recommend the Dolce Gusto to anyone. Too good for the price and I'am getting one myself! :)",
    "This offer is a great price and a great taste, thanks Amazon for selling this product.<br /><br />Staral",
    "McCann's Instant Oatmeal is great if you must have your oatmeal but can only scrape together two or three minutes to prepare it. There is no escaping the fact, however, that even the best instant oatmeal is nowhere near as good as even a store brand of oatmeal requiring stovetop preparation.  Still, the McCann's is as good as it gets for instant oatmeal. It's even better than the organic, all-natural brands I have tried.  All the varieties in the McCann's variety pack taste good.  It can be prepared in the microwave or by adding boiling water so it is convenient in the extreme when time is an issue.<br /><br />McCann's use of actual cane sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup helped me decide to buy this product.  Real sugar tastes better and is not as harmful as the other stuff. One thing I do not like, though, is McCann's use of thickeners.  Oats plus water plus heat should make a creamy, tasty oatmeal without the need for guar gum. But this is a convenience product.  Maybe the guar gum is why, after sitting in the bowl a while, the instant McCann's becomes too thick and gluey.",
    "This is a good instant oatmeal from the best oatmeal brand.  It uses cane sugar instead of high fructouse corn syrup, so not only does it have a better sweetness, but some doctors now say that this form of sugar is better for you.  Great on a cold morning when you don't have time to make McCann's Steel Cut Oats.  The apple cinnamon is the best but the maple and brown sugar or the regular are good too.  Plus they don't require doctoring to actually tell the three flavors apart.",
    "Instant oatmeal can become soggy the minute the water hits the bowl. McCann's Instant Oatmeal holds its texture, has excellent flavor, and is good for you all at the same time. McCann's regular oat meal is excellent, too, but may take a bit longer to prepare than most have time for in the morning. This is the best instant brand I've ever eaten, and a very close second to the non-instant variety.<br /><br />McCann's Instant Irish Oatmeal, Variety Pack of Regular, Apples & Cinnamon, and Maple & Brown Sugar, 10-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)",
    "McCann's Instant Irish Oatmeal, Variety Pack of Regular, Apples & Cinnamon, and Maple & Brown Sugar, 10-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)<br /><br />I'm a fan of the McCann's steel-cut oats, so I thought I'd give the instant variety a try. I found it to be a hardy meal, not too sweet, and great for folks like me (post-bariatric surgery) who need food that is palatable, easily digestible, with fiber but won't make you bloat.",
    "For those of us with celiac disease this product is a lifesaver and what could be better than getting it at almost half the price of the grocery or health food store!  I love McCann's instant oatmeal - all flavors!!!<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Abby",
    "What else do you need to know? Oatmeal, instant (make it with a half cup of low-fat milk and add raisins;nuke for 90 seconds). More expensive than Kroger store brand oatmeal and maybe a little tastier or better texture or something. It's still just oatmeal. Mmm, convenient!",
    "I WAS VISITING MY FRIEND NATE THE OTHER MORNING FOR COFFEE , HE CAME OUT OF HIS STORAGE ROOM WITH ( A PACKET OF McCANNS INSTANT IRISH OATMEAL .) HE SUGGESTED THAT I TRY IT FOR MY OWN USE ,IN MY STASH . SOMETIMES NATE DOSE NOT GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO SAY NO , SO I ENDED UP TRYING THE APPLE AND CINN . FOUND IT TO BE VERY TASTEFULL WHEN MADE WITH WATER OR POWDERED MILK . IT GOES GOOD WITH O.J. AND COFFEE AND A SLICE OF TOAST AND YOUR READY TO TAKE ON THE WORLD...OR THE DAY AT LEAST..

    "The variety packs taste great!<br /><br />I have them every morning. At $0.30 cents per meal, I don't understand why everyone on earth isn't buying this stuff up.<br /><br />Maple and brown sugar is terrific, followed by apples and cinnamon, followed by regular. You don't get tired of the same ole thing, and they taste great.<br /><br />I just boil water from a small pot, empty the packet or 2 in a bowl, pour in boiling water, and watch it expand to 2x its size!<br /><br />Taste really good and takes minutes to prepare.<br /><br />Not sure why everyone on earth isn't this. Convenient, healthy, very quick, excellent quality, and extremely cheap...",
    "McCann's makes oatmeal for every oatmeal connoisseur, whether one likes it from the raw pellet state that cooks for half an hour, to the sloth addled instant, which can be done in the microwave for under three minutes. It's all good, that's for sure, and the beauty of the instant variety is that it is available in different flavors as well as regular.<br />  This variety pack allows different tastes to be explored, as well as giving you a chance to experience the difference between McCann's and other well-known oatmeals. What I personally like about McCann's is that it cooks up thicker and with more body than the top brand here in America. The Apples & Cinnamon, though, tends to be a little liquidy so you may want to experiment with the amount of water you add. In my 1300watt microwave the oatmeal cooks up in about one minute and twenty-seven seconds, so you should also watch that to get a handle on how much time and water to use.<br />  The only bad thing -- if you can consider it a bad thing -- about this offering is that you have to buy in lot so you'll end up with six ten-count boxes. This is good if you have a whole family of oatmeal-eaters, but if you're a single person alone -- well, love oatmeal.",
    "I have McCann's Oatmeal every morning and by ordering it from Amazon I am able to save almost $3.00 per box.<br />It is a great product. Tastes great and very healthy",
    "McCann's Oatmeal is a good quality choice.  Our favorite is the Apples and Cinnamon, but we find that none of these are overly sugary.  For a good hot breakfast in 2 minutes, this is excellent.",
    "We really like the McCann's steel cut oats but find we don't cook it up too often.<br />This tastes much better to me than the grocery store brands and is just as convenient.<br />Anything that keeps me eating oatmeal regularly is a good thing.",
    "This seems a little more wholesome than some of the supermarket brands, but it is somewhat mushy and doesn't have quite as much flavor either.  It didn't pass muster with my kids, so I probably won't buy it again.",
    "Good oatmeal.  I like the apple cinnamon the best.  Though I wouldn't follow the directions on the package since it always comes out too soupy for my taste.  That could just be me since I like my oatmeal really thick to add some milk on top of.",
    "The flavors are good.  However, I do not see any differce between this and Oaker Oats brand - they are both mushy.",
    "I really like the Maple and Brown Sugar flavor. The regular is fine with brown sugar added. The Apples and Cinnamon flavor is OK. This is a very quick, easy and satisfying breakfast and I'll order this brand again, but not the variety. I'll get all Maple and Brown Sugar.",
    "This is the same stuff you can buy at the big box stores.  There is nothing healthy about it.  It is just carbs and sugars.  Save your money and get something that at least has some taste.",
    "This oatmeal is not good. Its mushy, soft, I don't like it. Quaker Oats is the way to go.",
    "Got a free package of these with a bottle of bloody mary mix I bought from the seller, and the advertising worked..lol,  I tried them, and shared them with 2 buddies, and we all loved them...  So im here to buy more, and noticed there were no reviews yet,...  well now there is.  They are Hot,  but not \"burn your mouth forever hot\"  its a nice temp...  Perfect for us..",
    "This wasn't in stock the last time I looked. I had to go to the Vermont Country Store in Weston to find it along with a jaw harp, Cranberry Horseradish Sauce, Fartless Black Bean Salsa, Apple Cider Jelly, Newton's Cradle Art in Motion and the staple Vermont Maple Syrup.<br /><br />Back to the Ass Kickin Peanuts. They are hot. They will activate the perspiration glands behind your ears and under your arms. It requires a beverage as advertised, a glass of very cold milk, and a box of Kleenex since it will make your nose run. They look like ordinary peanuts which is already giving me ideas for work. I suspect that some people have been hitting my goodies in my absence, especially my colleague Greg. I'm going to take this to work at earliest opportunity and empty the contents of this can into an ordinary Planters Peanuts can, and then see whose crying or whose nose is running when I return.<br /><br />The can should be shaken to ensure the spices are evenly distributed. It is important to wash your hands after consumption and not touch the eyes.<br /><br />You'll go nuts over these Ass-Kickin' Peanuts.<br /><br />P.S. I'm not sharing the peanuts, not deliberately, and I'll probably give Greg the jaw harp for Christmas. He'll be so insulted.",
    "we're used to spicy foods down here in south texas and these are not at all spicy.  doubt very much habanero is used at all.  could take it up a notch or two.",
    "I roast at home with a stove-top popcorn popper (but I do it outside, of course). These beans (Coffee Bean Direct Green Mexican Altura) seem to be well-suited for this method. The first and second cracks are distinct, and I've roasted the beans from medium to slightly dark with great results every time. The aroma is strong and persistent. The taste is smooth, velvety, yet lively.",
    "We roast these in a large cast iron pan on the grill (about 1/3 of the bag at a time).  The smell is wonderful and the roasted beans taste delicious too.  More importantly, the coffee is smooth; no bitter aftertaste.  On numerous occasions, we've had to send the roasted beans home with friends because they like it so much.",
    "Deal was awesome!  Arrived before Halloween as indicated and was enough to satisfy trick or treaters.  I love the quality of this product and it was much less expensive than the local store's candy.",
    "It is chocolate, what can I say.  Great variety of everything our family loves.  With a family of six it goes fast here.  Perfect variety.  Kit Kat, Reeses, take five and more.",
    "Great product, nice combination of chocolates and perfect size!  The bags had plenty, and they were shipped promptly.  The kids in the neighborhood liked our candies!",
    "Halloween is over but, I sent a bag to my daughters class for her share. The chocolate was fresh and enjoyed by many.",
    "Watch your prices with this.  While the assortment was good, and I did get this on a gold box purchase, the price for this was<br />$3-4 less at Target.",
    "This bag of candy online is pretty expensive, it should be cheaper in order to compete with grocery stores, other than that, its a good combination of my favorite candy",
    "Arrived in 6 days and were so stale i could not eat any of the 6 bags!!",
    "I have used the endurolyte product for several years in both pill and powder form.  Long desert rides on the dirt bike always found my camelbak water heavily laced with the endurolyte powder, not overly tasty, but quite effective, as I never got a cramp on these several hundred mile rides.  Same for desert racing in the buggy, the camelbaks were always laced with the powder.  Now we have the Fizz...what a great product!  Firstly, its Hammer's endurolyte product so it's great, endurance athlete's the world over use their products. Second its convenient, handly tablets that dissovle in a fizz.  Third it tastes great! Imagine getting a nice cool drink when your body is starving for hydration and electrolytes and rather than getting a \"salty\" taste, you get a refreshing lemon-lime or mango!  The camelbaks always get the Fizz now.  I also drop a tablet in my bottled water whenever I exercise and have a nice flavored water chock full of electrolytes. I cannot recommend this product or any hammer product highly enough.",
    "This product serves me well as a source of electrolytes during and after a long run or bike ride.<br />I have tried all of the flavors but really do like the grapefruit flavor... no after-taste and I actually like the slight carbonation.<br />I use other Hammer products and really like their whole product line.",
    "This stuff really works for preventing cramping during the middle to latter stages of your rides. Pop 1 into each water bottle and you're set. Flavor is fine and goes down easy.",
    "For those of us on a low carb diet these little tablets are just the thing.<br /><br />Two years ago I started cycling again after many years but was having heart arrhythmia after longer rides in high heat.  I was drinking plain water but did a little research and thought electrolytes might be the issue.  Gatorade wasn't an option because it is so loaded with carbohydrates so I looked around for a low-carb alternative.  The \"zero carb\" sports drinks didn't help so what to do?  One day I ran across these at my bike shop so tried a tube of them.....voila!...problem solved!!<br /><br />I've shared them with two friends in particular whose problems with leg cramps were resolved while using these.<br /><br />These guys got it right -- they are superbly formulated and simply work.....",
    "I purchased the Mango flavor, and to me it doesn't take like Mango at all.  There is no hint of sweetness, and unfortunately there is a hint or aftertaste almost like licorice.  I've been consuming various sports nutrition products for decades, so I'm familiar and have come to like the taste of the most of the products I've tried.  The mango flavor is one of the least appealing I've tasted.  It's not terrible, but it's bad enough that I notice the bad taste every sip I take.",
    "If you're impulsive like me, then $6 is ok. Don't get me wrong, the quality of these babies is very good and I have no complaints. But in retrospect, the price is a little ridiculous (esp. when you add on the shipping).",
    "this was sooooo deliscious but too bad i ate em too fast and gained 2 pds! my fault",
    "These Albanese gummi bears and rings and so on are very good and tasty and high quality. The bears even have little faces. At my local candy store this type of gummi stuff (bears, rings, snakes, balls, worms, whatever) are about $10/lb. These twin packs of 4.5 or 5 pound bags is a screaming deal as far as I'm concerned. I'm probably 50 pounds deep in these friggin' things. Consumed!",
    "Grape gummy bears are hard to find in my area. In fact pretty much anyone I talk to about grape gummy bears they think I'm lying. So I bought 10lbs... : ) These bears are a little bit bigger then the other brands and have kind of sour kick, but nothing to strong. I love grape flavored candy/soda and these are pretty good. There is another company that makes grape gummy bears that are a little bit better in my opinion, but these are well worth it for the price. I like to use the gummy bears in home made Popsicles with flavored sports drink. The salt in the sports drink makes for softer popsicles, and the gummy bears are awesome frozen. They are delicious!",
    "I ordered two of these and two of raspberry latice tarts directly from FantasiCakes website for a dinner party I was hosting. It arrived fresh and intact. Very good size. I froze half for later use. I am a pastry lover and these were the best I've ever tasted. The pastry was soft, the jam was really good and the taste was great. They were gone in no time. My guests were really impressed.",
    "Buyer Beware Please! This sweetener is not for everybody.  Maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body.  You will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience. Nausea, diarrhea & headaches can also be experienced. I learned my lesson the hard way years ago when I fell in love with the sugar-free chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell.  I thought I'd found sugar-free chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in.  The discomfort was unlike anything I had ever felt before.  I blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping.  As the symptoms passed, this too was very unpleasant.  Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit, all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate. My hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when I purchased some delicious sugar-free popcorn at my local market.  The taste was amazing and while I was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy, new sugarfree treat taste so good, my heart sank when I followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener* down to the very bottom of the label and read \"maltitol\" in tiny little letters! Thank goodness I'd eaten only a little. I still ended up with all the same side-effects but for a much shorter duration. Some people can use maltitol to their heart's content but others, like me, can have a bad reaction to it. In case you're like me, ... it's not you ...it's the maltitol!",
    "It is okay.  I would not go out of my way to buy it again",
    "No tea flavor at all. Just whole brunch of artifial flavors. It is not returnable. I wasted 20+ bucks.",
    "These looked like a perfect snack to through in with my trail mix.  Unfortunately, they arrived in a solid mass of melted chocolate.  I left them in my pantry for a few days, and when I opened them at room temperature they were still gooey.  I through them in the fridge and I've been breaking off hunks ever since.  They taste good to me, but the chocolate is all grainy after melting and then solidifying again.  I won't order them online again, but if I see them in a store I would pick them up.",
    "These taste really good. I have been purchasing a different brand and these are very similar in taste and texture. I agree with the other reviewer regarding ordering in the summer. There is no insulating packaging with ice packs so they will melt in warm weather like all chocolate food items. Order in cold weather and buy enough to last!!!",
    "The taste was great, but the berries had melted.  May order again in winter. If you order in cold weather you should enjoy flavor.",
    "i know i cannot make tea this good.  granted, i am not from the south but i know i have never enjoyed tea that was this sweet without being too sweet.  it tastes crisp.",
    "This peppermint stick is delicious and fun to eat.  My dad got me one for Christmas because he remembered me having a similar one when I was a little girl.  I'm 30 now and I love it!",
    "Great gift for all ages! I purchased these giant canes before and the recipients loved them so much, they kept them and would not eat them.",
    "I know the product title says Molecular Gastronomy, but don't let that scare you off.  I have been looking for this for a while now, not for food science, but for something more down to earth.  I use it to make my own coffee creamer.<br /><br />I have to have my coffee blonde and sweet - but the flavored creamers are full of the bad kinds of fat, and honestly, I hate to use manufactured \"food\" items.  I really don't think they are good for the body.  On the other hand, I hate using cold milk or cream, because I like HOT coffee.<br /><br />I stumbled across this on Amazon one day and got the idea of making my own creamer.  I also bought low-fat (non-instant) milk powder and regular milk powder. The non-instant lowfat milk is a little sweeter and tastes fresher than regular instant low-fat milk, but does not dissolve good in cold water - which is not a problem for hot coffee.  You will have to play with the ratios - I would not do just the heavy cream, it made the coffee too rich. Also, I think the powder is too expensive to just use on it's own. I like mixing 1/3 of each together.<br /><br />For flavoring, I bough cocoa bean powder, vanilla bean powder, and caster (superfine) sugar.  I mix up small batches along with spices like cinnamon and nutmeg to make my own flavored creamers.  If you wanted, you could use a fake sweetner powder instead.  I make up small amounts that I store in jelly canning jars. I also use my little food chopper/food processor to blend everything, so the sugar is not heavier and sinks to the bottom.  Let it settle for a bit before opening the top though.<br /><br />This stuff tastes WAY better than the storebought creamers and it is fun to experiment and come up with your own flavors.  I am going to try using some essential oils next and see if I can get a good chocolate/orange mix.<br /><br />All of the ingredients I mentioned are here online.  Take the time to experiment.  Maybe you don't use any low-fat milk. Or don't add any flavorings.  It is up to you.  Also, would make great housewarming/host(ess) gifts.<br /><br />I am sure other molecular people will be able to tell you more of what you can do with it, and I am sure I will experiment with it in cooking - but the main reason I bought it was to make my own creamer and it worked out great.",
    "While my dogs like all of the flavors that we have tried of this dog food, for some reason their itching increased when I tried the lamb and rice. I have some very itchy dogs and am giving them a limited ingredient dog food to try to help. The duck and sweet potato cut down on the itching significantly, but when we tried lamb and rice they started itching more once again. I like Natural Balance for the quality ingredients.",
    "Awesome dog food. However, when given to my \"Boston\", who has severe reactions to some food ingredients; his itching increased to violent jumping out of bed at night, scratching. As soon as I changed to a different formula, the scratching stopped. So glad Natural Balance has other choices. I guess you have to try each, until you find what's best for your pet.",
    "We have three dogs and all of them love this food!  We bought it specifically for one of our dogs who has food allergies and it works great for him, no more hot spots or tummy problems.<br />I LOVE that it ships right to our door with free shipping.",
    "My dog has a ton of allergies both environmental and food. She was on a prescription dog food before we had her tested to see what allergies she has. After we got the test back, we learned she was allergic to something in the prescription brand. So I finally found this dog food and she has done so well on this! She still has her environmental triggers, but I am happy she can finally eat something I know won't cause her pain.",
    "My shepherd/collie mix has IBS.  Our vet recommended a limited ingredient food.  This has really helped her symptoms and she likes it.  I will always buy it from Amazon...it's $10 cheaper and free shipping!",
    "Natural Balance Dry Dog Food Lamb Meal and Brown Rice Recipe did wonders for my Jack Russell. She has awful food allergy's and this food was our last hope because it was the last food we could find that didn't have SOMETHING in it that she was allergic to. She has no problem eating it dry but normally I mix the Natural Balance Dry Lamb and Brown Rice with the Natural Balance Wet Lamb and Brown Rice.. she seems to like that better. We started feeding it to our other dog (a Bichon) too and she loves it. If your dog has allergy's or stomach issue.. or if you want your dog to eat better food-- this is it! You will see a difference in your pet.",
    "Great food! I love the idea of one food for all ages & breeds. Ît's a real convenience as well as a really good product.  My 3 dogs eat less, have almost no gas, their poop is regular and a perfect consistency, what else can a mom ask for!!",
    "I have a standard poodle and pomeranian who both do wonderful on this food. I have switched them to a different food (due to price) a couple of times and end up going right back to natural balance.",
    "This is great dog food, my dog has severs allergies and this brand is the only one that we can feed him.",
    "This food is great - all ages dogs.  I have a 3 year old and a puppy.  They are both so soft and hardly ever get sick.  The food is good especially when you have Amazon Prime shipping  :)",
    "My golden retriever is one of the most picky dogs I've ever met.  After experimenting with various types of food, I have found she loves natural balance.  What I really like about natural balance is the fact that it has multiple flavors in dry and wet varieties.  I mix her dry food with a little wet food and my golden loves it.  Furthermore, I do like mixing up the flavors each time as I think the same meal day over day might get a little boring, so I figured why not.  I tend to stay away from the fish type though as it smells...<br /><br />Additionally, I started purchasing off Amazon because Petco didn't have the wet food box and only had a couple of cans.  I came home and to my surprise realized that I could save $20 each time I bought dog food if I just buy it off Amazon.<br /><br />All in all, I definitely recommend and give my stamp of approval to natural balance dog food.  While I have never eaten it, my dog seems to love it.",
    "This is the same food we get at pet store. But it's delivered to my door! And for the same price or slightly less.",
    "I've been very pleased with the Natural Balance dog food. Our dogs have had issues with other dog foods in the past and I had someone recommend Natural Balance grain free since it is possible they were allergic to grains. Since switching I haven't had any issues. It is also helpful that have have different kibble size for larger/smaller sized dogs.",
    "My 1-1/2 year old basenji/jack russell mix loves this dog food. He's been noticeably healthier and more energetic since I switched him over from the standard dog foods earlier this year. Despite the higher cost of natural dog foods, I find that he eats significantly less of the Natural Balance dog foods and still stays happy and full. On the normal dog foods, he'd eat up to 3 cups of dog food a day (the recommended serving for his size), whereas he only eats about 1 cup to 1-1/2 cup of the Natural Balance dog food a day. When you take this into account, you're actually getting more \"bang for your buck\" with the natural dog foods since you don't have to buy as much to last just as long as the normal dog foods... and a healthier, happier dog, to boot! Add in the fact that you can get free, 2-day shipping with Amazon Prime... I'm sold!!",
    "Our pup has experienced allergies in forms of hotspots and itching from other dog foods. The cheap 'you can buy it anywhere' food not only have crazy preservatives in them but can cause health problems for your pets.  This food works wonders on reducing allergies and our dog loves the food.<br />This message is RAMSEY FrAnkenSteiN approved.",
    "My English Bulldog had skin allergies the summer we got him at age 3.  The vet recommended we wean him off the food his previous owner gave him (Iams Lamb and Rice) and onto a new kind.  This was the second one we tried, and it has been working ever since.  It's for dogs that need a limited diet who can be sensitive to additives and proteins commonly found in commercial dog food (like chicken or beef).",
    "I fed this to my Golden Retriever and he hated it.  He wouldn't eat it, and when he did, it gave him terrible diarrhea.  We will not be buying this again.  It's also super expensive.",
    "The mouth says, \"How do I love thee, let me count the ways...\"<br />If you like apple products a must have item.  The only draw back, shipping cost.  These are very heavy.",
    "Arrived slightly thawed. My parents wouldn't accept it. However, the company was very helpful and issued a full refund.",
    "The crust on these tarts are perfect.  My husband loves these, but I'm not so crazy about them.  They are just too sour/tart for my taste.  I'll eat the crust and hubby takes my filling.  My kids think they're great, so maybe it's just me.",
    "These are absolutely scrumptuous!  My husband and I both love them, however, as another customer put it, they are expensive to ship!  The cost of shipping is more than the tartlets themselves are!",
    "What a nice alternative to an apple pie. Love the fact there was no slicing and dicing. Easy to prepare. I also loved the fact that you can make them fresh whenever needed.",
    "I like Creme Brulee. I loved that these were so easy. Just sprinkle on the sugar that came with and broil. They look amazing and taste great. My guess thought I really went out of the way for them when really it took all of 5 minutes. I will be ordering more!",
    "not what I was expecting in terms of the company's reputation for excellent home delivery products",
    "I first bought pickled asparagus at an Amish market and it was love at first bite. Hence, when I saw these on the discount rack at the local Safeway I cleaned it out.  These are even better than the ones from the Amish market. They are fantastic, and some of the jars have a bonus clove of garlic at the bottom. I'm going to order the six pack and I'm a household of one. They wont go to waste!",
    "I love asparagus.  Up until very recently, I had never had pickled asparagus.  Oh my goodness, when a friend introduced me to this exact brand, I couldn't believe how great stuff tasted.  I loved it so much I bought the six pack.  I've got 2 jars left.  Gonna need more!!",
    "I'm presently on a diet and I was at my Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Grocery looking over possible diet foods. I wanted things that were tasty, non-fat and low in calories. I came home with about a dozen items. That's how I discovered the Tillen Farms Pickled Crispy Asparagus. Well, I've always liked asparagus anyway and I've enjoyed several brands of pickled asparagus. This Tillen Farms brand is really, really good! It's the best I can recall. There's an excellent flavor and a big clove of garlic down in  the bottom of the jar which I'm looking forward to eating. I can't believe how good this asparagus tastes and right on the front it says \"only 60 calories per jar!\" Now this is my idea of a good diet food!<br /><br />Gary Peterson",
    "I was diappointed in the flavor and texture of this mix.  I usually like most of the Low Carb things I have tried, but was diappointed in this specific one.",
    "I have been drinking this tea for a long time now.  I used to have to purchase it at a doctor's office because it wasn't available elsewhere.  I'm so glad that I can buy it now from Amazon.com.  I drink this tea throughout the day like other folks drink coffee.  Wonderful taste.",
    "I have been drinking Royal King 100% Natural Organic Green Tea (100 tea bags x 2g each) as my every day tea for several years now.  I buy 12 boxes at a time to save on shipping.  For many years I used to drink coffee from morning till night.  But finally I realized that drinking so much coffee was not healthy for me.  I finally resolved to improve my health and stopped drinking coffee all together.  I tried many alternative drinks to replace my coffee habit.  I found that green tea was not only good tasting it also has health benefits.  Green tea is one of the few drinks that actually makes you healthier (coffe and other drinks do not) - the only healthier drink is quality cold water.  In my opinion, for the price, Royal King 100% Natural Organic Green Tea is one of the best tasting teas.  This green tea has a beautiful golden color, the taste is bright and fresh.  I recommend adding a tiny amount of Y.S. Organic Bee Farms RAW HONEY to the tea to add sweetness and health benefits too.  I also give myself a treat once in a while by having a much more expense tea (Tribute Xi Hu Long Jing) but this fantastic tea is not practical for me to drink as my every day tea (although I would if I could afford it).<br /><br />Cons:  On my latest shipment the package shown on the Amazon page is different than the one shipped.  The one shipped displays \"NATURALLY HIGH IN POLYPHENOL CATECHINS\" (a key contributive element to the possible health effects of tea), whereas the Amazon package displays \"CAFFENE FREE\".  So I am not sure if this green tea is Caffene free or not.  The other con is that sometimes the tea bag rips open when I unwrap the string from around the tea bag. So if the string seems stuck to the tea bag I put the bag in the hot water to unstick it.",
    "this has to be one of the best teas I have ever tasted... it's clean, bright, fresh...<br /><br />great delivery...again quality... just try it...",
    "I love, love this green tea.  It is very hard to find in our area and some places on the internet charge a big price and I usually don't get as many boxes as I did with this merchant.  I will definitely order from this seller again!! Thanks!!  I depend on my green tea fix everyday!",
    "I love this tea. It helps curb my eating during the day. My Mom and I have given it all friends to try.",
    "I'm Italian and I lived in Italy for years. I used to buy these cookies for my everyday breakfast with an Italian espresso. I couldn't find them anywhere here in the Bay area, so it's great to have them again.",
    "In the 1980s I spent several summers in Italy. This biscotti is often given as a breakfast food or mid-day snack. They are simple and delicious and were not sold in the US back then. They are so good that I brought back two bags from a recent trip to Italy. It is great to see that they may now be found on Amazon!<br /><br />Note: it is great to open a bag, smell the contents, pour a glass of milk, then dip the Macines in the milk. Great routine and treat for kids!",
    "I had heard a little about this product from the local pet store, then tried a small bag for our 2 cats of about 3 and 6 years respectively. The female, younger one took to it right away, and the older male, who was unfortunately weaned on the junk cat food with all the corn meal and etc... in it, and would usually refuse a diet change, actually liked it too. The older male is overweight and we were trying to switch him to soft food on the doctor's request, but he totally refused it. He is a posh cat after all. He still consumes too many calories, the fatty, but at least I know he's eating good food. Of course, I know this product seems to cost more than most other feline food on the market, but I just can't see feeding our animals the lousy alternatives that are out there, marketed as being healthy. Why do commercials show cats eating a vegetarian diet which is mostly corn meal? Is that right? I'll stay with this for now, but stay tuned.<br /><br />I'm updating this review after 9 months of using this cat food for our two cats. I upgraded the stars from 4 to 5 as it really has been a good food for the two of them. Garfield still eats a little too much, but he's just a big cat who doesn't exercise much, let's face it. Our female cat will be 4 years old in a couple months and she's so healthy. She's tiny, but happy and agile. I tried the chicken version of Holistic Select, but Garfield seemd to miss this sardine version so we went back to this one. I've ordered the duck version and will update this once they try it.",
    "I started buying this after I noticed my 1 year old cat was already starting to lose his \"spunk\" so I decided it was time to start buying him \"real\" cat food...not the garbage in the super markets. I found this at the pet store out of the other million choices, and I'm sure there are other brands that are just as good but this is the one I went with to try first and it was a great purchase. My cat has been on this for the past 8 months and he's now just has active as he was when he was a kitten and his coat has became sooo soft. Mainly, he loved the taste even more! I highly recommend this brand to all my friends and family for their animals!",
    "I have done a lot of research to find the best food for my cat, and this is an excellent food.  That is also according to my holistic veterinarian.  They put probiotics on the kibble as the last step, which is very important to me.  The best thing is that my cat loved it immediately and I had to stop mixing it with the old food because she only would eat Holistic Select.",
    "This cat food was recommended by my vet because my 13 year old Cleo Cat was having trouble keeping any food down and was loosing weight.  It stopped her problems.  She doesn't eat as much as before since she seems to be more satisfied after eating which helps justify the added price.  It aids in digestion since the...ok sorry...smells are gone if ya know what I mean.  Had to add that so anyone experiencing problems with their cats can see there are a lot of benifits from this cat food.",
    "I have a 4 year old male cat who has chronic urinary tract infections.  I feed him this dry food in combination with wet food (with water added to it) and Uri Ease.  The combination seems to keeps his UTI's under control.  If I switch to another type of dry food, his UTI gets worse.  The other cats seem to enjoy this food as well.  It's expensive but it seems to be the best solution for me.",
    "Before I was educated about feline nutrition, I allowed my cats to become addicted to dry cat food. I always offered both canned and dry, but wish I would have fed them premium quality canned food and limited dry food. I have two 15 year old cats and two 5 year old cats. The only good quality dry foods they will eat are Wellness and Innova. Innova's manufacturer was recently purchased by Procter&Gamble. I began looking for a replacement. After once again offering several samples (from my local holistic pet store) Holistic Select was the only one (other than the usual Wellness and Innova) they would eat. For finicky cats, I recommend trying Holistic Select. It is a good quality food that is very palatable for finicky eaters.",
    "My holistic vet recommended this, along with a few other brands. We tried them all, but my cats prefer this (especially the sardine version). The best part is their coats are so soft and clean and their eyes are so clear. AND (and I don't want to be rude, so I'll say this as delicately as I can) their waste is far less odorous than cats who eat the McDonalds junk found in most stores, which is a definite plus for me! The health benefits are so obvious - I highly recommend Holistic Select!",
    "One of my cats is allergic to fish and beef. This formula is one of the few she can eat, and it has much better ingredients than the prescription diets available at the vet. Both of my kitties are very active, have soft shiny fur, and neither are fat. Dry food reduces tartar buildup on teeth, also.",
    "Our cats thrive extremely well on this dry cat food.  They definitely have much less hair ball throw ups and their fur is great.  They are fit and not over weight.  This vendor ships extremely fast.  Is one of the top Amazon suppliers in our book!",
    "I've been a fan of Hot & Spicy Maruchan Ramen for a long time. If you enjoy spice, and love ramen, you'll love this product. Too bad it's way too expensive here on Amazon. It's only $3.36 per 12 at my Walmart.",
    "I've been eating Ramen noodles since I was a little kid, and I've never found a better flavor than Hot & Spicy Chicken!  It isn't hot at all to a chilihead like me, but it sure is good!",
    "I LOVE spicy ramen, but for whatever reasons this thing burns my stomach badly and the burning sensation doesn't go away for like 3 hours! Not sure if that is healthy or not .... and you can buy this at Walmart for $0.28, way cheaper than Amazon.",
    "Always being a fan of ramen as a quick and easy meal, finding it on amazon for a decent price and having it delivered to your door by the case is an amazing situation for anyone to find themselves in.",
    "I must be a bit of a wuss, because this soup tastes to me how I imagine fire might taste. Typically I like spicy food if it has a good flavor.  I don't find this to be the case with this soup. Any flavor is killed off by the burn.",
    "I really loved the spicy flavor these had.  I found myself liking the broth more than the noodles which is usually the opposite.  If you aren't used to the heat this might bother you and if you like hot hot foods this might not be enough.",
    "Got these on sale for roughly 25 cents per cup, which is half the price of my local grocery stores, plus they rarely stock the spicy flavors. These things are a GREAT snack for my office where time is constantly crunched and sometimes you can't escape for a real meal. This is one of my favorite flavors of Instant Lunch and will be back to buy every time it goes on sale.",
    "i have bought allot of different flavors and this happens to be one of my favorites and will be getting more soon",
    "I love this flavor of ramen! I don't eat other flavors anymore because they taste too bland by comparison. For the convenience of having it delivered to my home (I have prime, so I get it in two days and don't have to pay for the shipping), the price on amazon isn't bad at all, but it is still cheaper to run down and pick up a case of this at the grocery store.",
    "The BEST investment I've ever made for ginger. It's unbelievable! It's fibrous like the real ginger, has that spicy kick to it, but it's perfect with the sugar - calms it down.  It's very worth the $40 for 5lbs of it!  I'll be getting more soon - I use these as a topper for my ginger cupcakes and cookies :)",
    "Delicious. I cannot get Australian ginger where I live. This compares favorably to Australian Ginger I've purchased in other cities. Now I can enjoy it without traveling.",
    "I keep trying other brands.... cheaper brands. Stupid me! This ginger IS soooo worth the money. Tender, moist and never a let down.",
    "My son has had acid reflux since birth and has been on every medication available with no improvement, Until an older gentleman came into his work place and told him about this product and I automatically ordered it for him. I was really not expecting any better results than the 1000 other things we have tried. What a surprise! He has not had any heartburn or symptoms since day 2 of starting eating one piece of this Ginger each morning. He can now eat anything and actually enjoy it. This product was a God send for him. Thank you all for it!",
    "I bought this for our office to give people something sweet to snack on.  Because it's bite size it's easier for people to grab a couple a pieces rather than an entire licorice stick. My only complaint is that one of the bags broke open in shipping.",
    "Twizzlers brand licorice is much better than that other well known brand.<br />If you can get these for $2 to $2.50 a package with free s/h it's a good deal.<br />The black and cherry have good taste; but the strawberry taste was too delicate and barely there",
    "I love these.........very tasty!!!!!!!!!!!  Infact, I think I am addicted to them.<br />Buying them in packs of 6 bags - is very reasonable than going to Target and getting a bag.  Savings are about a $1.00 a bag.  I use subscribe and save on these and several other product.  I love subscribe and save!!!!!!!!!!!",
    "If you are looking for a less messy version of licorice for the children, then be sure to try these!  They're soft, easy to chew, and they don't get your hands all sticky and gross in the car, in the summer, at the beach, etc. We love all the flavos and sometimes mix these in with the chocolate to have a very nice snack! Great item, great price too, highly recommend!",
    "I might be mistaken, but it appears that the pieces in this bag were reduced in size.  If they did do that, it was doubtlessly done to make it appear that the buyer got a better deal, having so many pieces after all.  The problem is that the pieces have to be a certain size in order to have enough flavor for your eating experience.  As it is, you have to use 2 or 3 pieces to match the old piece size;  it is not the same.",
    "Being a fan of Newman's Pineapple salsa for quite a while, I was looking for a comparable salsa.  This is one of the best tasting salsas I've ever had.  My daughters love it too.  They don't like super chunky salsa and the Berry Mango has a nice smooth texture with small mango pieces.  The salsa is not too sweet, just sweet enough and although it's mild, it has a nice little kick to it.  At this price, it's a steal!",
    "The SALSA smelled delicious, as I think it probably was - but, unfortunately, the person, at AMAZON, that is a packer (there is probably several) had very little \"stuffing\" to work with, especially on the bottoms.  Therefore, the bottoms were broken on all three bottles. As I reached for my computer; I was told NO RETURNS (cause it's a food item).  I then looked for a CUSTOMER SERVICE tag; and I found \"none\" on their NEW FACE LIFT.  THEY SEEM TO BE PROUD OF THEIR NEW FACE LIFT BUT...THEY SHOULD AT LEAST HAVE A PLACE TO CONTACT THEM IN EMERGENCIES!  LIKE: I BUY A LOT OF \"STUFF\" AND IT ALL COMES IN STYROFOAM BOXES.  NEVER WOULD I SHIP THINGS<br />ESPECIALLY SALSA - IN A CARDBOARD BOX WITH JUST A STRIPE OF LARGE BUBBLE WRAP ON IT.  NO MATTER HOW MUCH THE CARRIER (FED EX) IS CAREFUL, IT'S GOING TO BREAK SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE.  ESPECIALLY IN AN ALL GLASS CONTAINER!  BARBARA L. S.",
    "This is one of the best salsas that I have found in a long time but stay away from the variety pack. The other two that come with it are not worth your money.",
    "These remind me of dog treats I made once using pumpkin and cinnamon. They're kind of bland and not my favorite Back To Nature product. But my finace really loves them so that's where the three stars come from.",
    "This is the best cornmeal. I made regular cornbread and hot water cornbread with this meal and both were outstanding. Also fried some oysters with this meal, it gave them a great texture and flovor.",
    "This is a fabulous marinade!  I love to use it for chicken, either baked in the oven OR on the grill.  This has enough flavor & flair, I've even used it for dinner parties, only to receive rave reviews from my guests!! DEFINITELY worth the price! Super cheap and super easy! Love it!",
    "Works with chicken fish beef or pork. Fast easy and makes it taste excellent. Plus buying in bulk is more than 50% off from box stores",
    "Got this for my brother who is on Jorge Cruise diet and decided to try one for myself.  It actually tastes pretty good.",
    "These singles sell for $2.50 - $3.36 at the store for 1 box of 24 singles. I'm not sure why Amazon is selling it for $9.99 for a box of 24 singles.  Hazelnut coffee creamer is my favorite, but truly this is not a good buy.",
    "AWESOME!!! such a yummy flavor I got it as a healthy alternative to the desserts we normally eat and I am so glad that I did there are so many things you can do with Jello desserts and still have them taste good and be good for you. I will definitentally be purchasing this product again the flavor was so wonderful.",
    "I went to 4 grocery stores looking for this flavor of Jello for my green tomato jam recipe and finally found it here. This jello is wonderful! Evidently it's only carried in the stores during the summer but with harvest time in the Fall, I couldn't find it anywhere in town. This Jello tastes like watermelon and the jam recipe I made with it takes like watermelon jam! Great made as regular Jello too. Yummy!",
    "What a deal this is the healthiest salt you can use.  This box should last our family the year no problem.  Iodized sea salt will not raise your blood pressure as regular salt will.",
    "Perfect size sea salt for the table or the picnic basket.  We love it. Shakes well, no clumping and flows freely.",
    "<span class=\"tiny\"> Length:: 0:26 Mins<br /><br /></span>The expiration date is 21 months from the day I bought this product. The tuna, tomato combination is delicious. This is one of the many items I re-order on Amazon every month or so.<br />edit: added a short video, so you see what this combination looks like.<br /><br />I was wearing one of those headlamps, but I didn't do a good job focusing on the tuna.<br />I should film it over, but it doesn't look like many people view this product anyway.",
    "I've never heard of the SAFCOL brand before but I was tired of only trying the typical pouches; Starkist and Chicken of the Sea. I was really surprised as I thought it was a bit better than the other brands and with less seasoning.",
    "these are the best tasting tuna pack they make in my opinion - make a great on the go snack, and really satisfying with the tomato",
    "I have always purchased Star-Kist tuna but thought I would try this brand for a change of pace. The taste of the tuna was not pleasant, too much basil and other spices for me.",
    "I'm not familiar with the Safcol brand but being a tuna addict, gave this a shot. The tuna tastes like it's good quality but I found the tomato basil flavor to be a bit bland. It's better than something plain but it didn't pack the punch I was hoping for. It's still a great option for a low calorie, low fat meal.",
    "I found it much tastier than the plain tuna pouches out there. Excellent quality, and no need to 'dress it up'.<br /><br />I put it the micro on about 20% power for 1 minute and Shazam!<br /><br />I believe a little heating brings out the flavor.",
    "Seriously this product was as tasteless as they come. There are much better tasting products out there but at 100 calories its better than a special k bar or cookie snack pack. You just have to season it or combine it with something else to share the flavor.",
    "I read about pomegranate molasses so I had to try it! I haven't made anything with it yet, just eaten a little bit at a time but WOW is it decadent! It's dark, syrupy, sour, and a little sweet. A dab of this and I forget about dessert. It's just a really unique flavor with a pleasing metallic undertone. Yum!! I'm going to try making fesenjan next :-)",
    "Used this in Moroccan recipes, as a syrup in a brilliant mixed beverage and as a swirled topping on sliced oranges soaked in orange water.  Wonderful, wonderful stuff!",
    "I don't know how long these sat on the back of a shelf somewhere, but they were so old that they wouldn't cook.  I had to throw half of them out, because the skins were damaged, a clear sign of dried beans past their prime.  I can't even return these or ask for a refund, because food is not returnable.  Will find a different brand to use.  For now, I have about fifty servings of beans to throw away.",
    "Besides being smaller than runts, they look the same and have the same consistency.  Unfortunately, they taste nothing like banana runts...nor do they even taste good.  Yucky stuff.  Trying to return with vendor.",
    "The item over all was fine, but the Banana Heads are not just like Banana Runts they are alot smaller. Also when I received the item, the packaging was not great. The Banana Heads had come open during shipping and were all over the packing envelope.",
    "I purchased as a giveaway for a baby shower with Jungle theme! They worked out perfect for 25 small bags of candy. I purchased 5#. If you want more than 25 small bags, I would purchase a larger bag.",
    "I have drunk Ricore since my mother allowed be to drink caffeine. I love this stuff in milk.<br />It's much smoother and tastier than instant coffee with milk. I am French and live in the US,<br />and bring back boxes of Ricore at every opportunity. Savora is another hidden gem you can bring<br />back. Check it out.",
    "I first had this drink when my mother brought it back with her from a visit to her home in Brittany France and thought it was delicious!  I wish it were a bit cheaper but other than that, I love this product!",
    "I couldn't wait to try the 8&#8243; Cinnamon Coffee Cake because it is made with fresh eggs, creamy sour cream, Madagascar Bourbon Vanilla and is topped and filled with cinnamon streusel. This 8&#8243; Cinnamon Coffee Cake is available online for only $18.95. Now, I have had my fair share of cinnamon coffee cakes, but, let me just tell you that the FantasiCakes Cinnamon Coffee Cake really \"takes the cake\" with size, price, quality and taste.<br />The cake arrived very fast and was carefully packaged so that it arrived in almost perfect condition. It also comes with a large tub of white icing that you can drizzle over the top, before serving. I couldn't believe how large the size was and it actually fed my family of 5 for us to enjoy during breakfast, for three days. The cake itself is thick and almost has a solid but sponge cake type consistency that is really moist and very filling. The flavors are to die for with the sticky cinnamon outside and sweet cinnamon and vanilla swirled throughout the inside of the cake. The icing really tops it off beautifully and gives it that moist and sticky sweet flavor. Pair the cake with your morning coffee and you've got the perfect breakfast treat!",
    "I used to love these growing up and stopped drinking water and lemon juice from this brand about 5-6 years ago. This stuff used to be so strong i used to just pour some in my mouth and get that alive feeling going. It feels like the product went through changes which added more water or something to make it not so strong. The stronger it is the less you use as well. The product is still really good but the taste is the same quality as the cheaper brand names almost. I thought  these would go fast but hey all lemon stuff i love unless it goes bad. This is a good product just wish it still had that hit me in the mouth chug sensation it used to be like.",
    "One of the best lemon juice that I have tried. I am recurring customer due to the high quality of this product. When the season for fresh lemos is out, this one supplement our need for the citrus on the kitchen or refreshments.<br /><br />I will continue buying it.",
    "This lemon juice is a must in my kitchen year-round. It has a powerful flavor and you don't need much of it to zest up a dish. I add a spritz of it to my water nearly every day.<br /><br />I will buy this product again and again.",
    "Fast delivery and good product. This is the same lemon juice concentrate you can find in stores and it's really handy to have around to add to sauces, dressings, etc. Such a pain to squeeze fresh juice everytime you need it, nevermind having the lemons on hand to begin with.",
    "This is not as good as the Frozen Lemon juice, but it is good. It has a slightly odd flavor, perhaps from a preservative. Sure wish I could order the frozen juice!",

After a short time my eyes start to get droopy and I am in another place.<br /><br />Love this stuff.",

    "WE have been looking for \"natural\" ways to help us sleep since we always seem to be overloaded with stress and a busy schedule. Yes, we'd probably be better served taking a yoga class, but this is a good second choice. This helps you fall asleep and stay asleep. I drank half the first night and that was plenty for me. After about 30 minutes, I was ready for bed! I woke up refreshed and with no sleepy-drug hangover, so that is a huge bonus.<br /><br />I gave the product 3 stars (instead of the 5 it deserves) as their packing job was marginal at best. The product arrived with 2 broken bottles, which at this price is a $6 loss! The bottles are glass and all they did was wrap one layer of the small-bubbled bubble wrap around the case and placed it in a larger box with extra room to move around in that box. Big packing fail, but the product is awesome.",
    "We made chocolate chip cookies with BRM Garbanzo Bean Flour and the results were fantastic!  The brown sugar and chocolate mask any bean taste that other reviews have mentioned.  Our friends couldn't discern any difference from classic CCCs.  The texture, body, and elasticity (meaning reduced tendency to fall apart that occurs with most other gluten-free flours) is nice and chewy -- the same as CCCs made with regular flour.  And an added bonus -- the high protein and fiber level (I calculate 2-3 g fiber/cookie) fills you up so that you are satisfied with smaller servings and the glycemic index is significantly lower.<br /><br />I highly recommend this flour even if CCCs are the only thing you make with it.",
    "This  is great stuff.  Made some really tasty banana bread.  Good quality and lowest price in town.",
    "We had trouble finding this locally - delivery was fast, no more hunting up and down the flour aisle at our local grocery stores.",
    "This packet of glaze is the secret to making those European style fresh fruit tarts. I am about to make one for a pie auction at church, after a friend requested that something \"strawberry\" should be offered. You can make the most amazing and relatively \"healthy\" fruit tarts by baking a base, layering it with uncooked, fresh, sliced fruit, then pouring over the made-up contents of one of these packets. They harden up at room temperature, hold the fruit together so you can slice the tart, and they let the beauty of the arranged fruit show through. I've also seen this glaze used over cheesecakes, to hold a fruit topping in place. Personally, I do not like cheesecake (too rich for me) but a fruit glazed cheesecake is gorgeous, I will admit. To do this, slice fruit and layer it on the cheesecake while it's still in the springform pan. Pour on the glaze, let it set up and then remove the springform. You'll have a clear layer of fruit on top of the cheesecake. Cherries, strawberries or sliced mangos are nice, but the best one I ever had used thin slices of lemons, that had been gently poached in sugar syrup before they were layered on the cake.<br /><br />I use a base of sponge cake, baked in a shallow form, but other bases can be pate sucre  (a kind of French pastry that is a bit like a sugar cookie) that works well in those fluted, straight-sided forms. You can also make mini-tarts in a muffin pan, pre-baking each mold with a layer of pie crust (even commercial crust works, though again, I prefer pate sucre, it holds its shape better and is more substantial and has a better crumb.) Just blind-bake the muffin tins lined with pate, then pop them out and fill with fresh fruits (berries are great) and pour over the glaze. Some people put a layer of creme patisserie, which is a pastry cream like custard but stabilized with flour,  below the fruit and I happen to think these taste best.<br /><br />If you get into baking, this glaze is a must-have on the shelf. The ingredients are vegan: tapioca starch, carrageenan, dextrose, cream of tartar, locust bean gum, so if you are looking to make a vegan tofu cheesecake, you can use this on top, as well as use it for fruit tarts with a nut crust base.",

    "I bought this coffee because its much cheaper than the ganocafe and has the organic reishi mushroom as well as other healthy antioxidants.  I didn't expect it to taste good, but it actually does!  I've only had it for a few days and for $5 its totally worth it.  My sisters all take ganocafe but now I'm introducing them to this less expensive similar coffee.  I will follow up on this product in a few weeks.  :)",
    "The coffee is very finely processed and the flavor is just alright.  Nescafe and Mount Hagen are better - I bought this to try something other than these two, but I probably won't get this again.  There is just a slight \"vitaminy\" taste, but it's not overwhelming.  It's also a bit pricey for what you get.",
    "This coffee is great because it's all organic ingredients!  No pesticides to worry about, plus it tastes good, and you have the healing effects for ganoderma.",

Cheers!",

    "Pros:<br />+packaging, shipping, price<br />+sold about a year before its expiration date (enough for me to eat/share 9 boxes)<br />+not too \"fresh\" like the regular wintergreen and not in a powdery form. it's a real mint!<br /><br />Cons: none!",
    "Be careful not to eat too many of them in one day, as one of the chemicals in it is the same as that of a LAXATIVE!!! LOLOLOL!!!",
    "These mints are really strong and have a great taste. They are also a convenient size to carry in a pocket or purse.",
    "This is a huge supply of them. I'm still working on these and have plenty to spare. Much more effective than buying one from the grocery store or 7-11 every time you want a mint.",
    "Even with small containers, they don't fill them up.  These little tins are less than half filled and at the price charged it seems a rip-off. Is there some exotic ingredient as costly as gold contained in those tiny squares?  Or how about the cereal ploy, they were filled at the factory but settled in transport.<br />Can manufacturers be honest in their dealings?"

    "If you're short on time but still crave a warm bowl of oatmeal, McCann's Instant Oatmeal is a great option. While it's no substitute for stovetop-cooked oatmeal, McCann's is the best instant oatmeal out there - even beating out organic and all-natural brands. The variety pack offers a range of delicious flavors that can be quickly prepared in the microwave or with boiling water, making it a convenient choice for busy mornings.\n\nOne of the reasons I chose McCann's is because they use real cane sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup. The difference in taste is noticeable, and it's a healthier option too. However, I do wish they didn't add thickeners like guar gum to their recipe. In my opinion, oats, water, and heat should be enough to create a creamy oatmeal. Perhaps the guar gum is responsible for the oatmeal becoming too thick and gluey after it sits for a while. Despite this, McCann's remains a convenient and tasty option for those in a hurry.",
    "Discover a nutritious and delicious instant oatmeal from a trusted brand, offering a healthier alternative to traditional options. Unlike many instant oatmeals that use high fructose corn syrup, this product is sweetened with cane sugar, which not only provides a richer flavor but also has potential health benefits, as recommended by some medical professionals. Perfect for busy mornings when you need a quick and satisfying breakfast, this oatmeal is a great alternative to cooking steel-cut oats from scratch. The apple cinnamon flavor stands out as a favorite, but the maple and brown sugar, as well as the regular flavor, are also excellent choices. What's more, each flavor has a distinct taste profile, eliminating the need for added ingredients to tell them apart.",

But let's be real, who has the time to cook it up in the morning? That's where McCann's Instant Oatmeal comes in - it's the perfect solution for busy mornings. In my opinion, it's the best instant oatmeal brand out there, and it's only a hair behind the non-instant variety in terms of taste and quality.\n\nCheck out the McCann's Instant Irish Oatmeal Variety Pack, featuring Regular, Apples & Cinnamon, and Maple & Brown Sugar flavors in 10-Count Boxes (Pack of 6). Give it a try and experience the difference for yourself!",
    "I recently tried McCann's Instant Irish Oatmeal Variety Pack, which includes Regular, Apples & Cinnamon, and Maple & Brown Sugar flavors in 10-count boxes (pack of 6). As a fan of their steel-cut oats, I was pleased to find that the instant variety is a hearty and satisfying meal that's not too sweet. It's also an excellent option for individuals like myself who have undergone bariatric surgery, as it's easy to digest, high in fiber, and won't cause bloating.",
    "As someone living with celiac disease, I can attest that this product is a game-changer. And the best part?

Before I knew it, he was encouraging me to give it a try and add it to my own pantry staples. Nate can be quite persuasive, so I found myself sampling the Apple and Cinnamon flavor. I was pleasantly surprised by how delicious it was, whether made with water or powdered milk. It pairs perfectly with a glass of OJ, a cup of coffee, and a slice of toast - the ultimate breakfast combo to kick-start your day!",

    "McCann's caters to the diverse preferences of oatmeal aficionados, offering a range of options to suit every taste and convenience requirement. From the raw, pellet-like state that requires a leisurely 30-minute cooking time to the instant variety that can be prepared in a mere 2 minutes and 45 seconds in the microwave, McCann's has something for everyone. The beauty of their instant oatmeal lies not only in its rapid preparation time but also in its availability in a variety of flavors, including the classic, unadulterated option.\n\nThis assortment pack presents the perfect opportunity to explore the vast spectrum of flavors and textures that McCann's has to offer, as well as to experience the distinct difference between their oatmeal and that of other well-established brands. One of the standout features of McCann's oatmeal, in my opinion, is its exceptional thickness and body, which sets it apart from the leading brand in the American market. However, it's worth noting that the Apples & Cinnamon flavor tends to have a slightly more liquid consistency, so some experimentation with water ratios may be necessary to achieve the desired texture.\n\nIn my 1300-watt microwave, the oatmeal cooks to perfection in approximately 1 minute and 27 seconds, so it's essential to monitor the cooking time and adjust the water content accordingly. The only potential drawback of this product, if it can be considered a drawback at all, is that it is sold in bulk, with six 10-count boxes per package. While this is ideal for large families of oatmeal enthusiasts, singles may find themselves with an abundance of oatmeal, which, of course, is not necessarily a bad thing for those who share a deep affection for this wholesome breakfast staple.",

It keeps me hooked on oatmeal, which is a total win in my book!",
    "I was hoping for a more authentic, homemade taste from this brand, but unfortunately, it fell short.

It's the perfect way to start my day!",
    "I'm really enjoying the flavors of this product! While the texture may be similar to Oaker Oats brand, I think they're both doing something right - the mushy consistency is clearly a winning formula!",
    "I'm absolutely hooked on the Maple and Brown Sugar flavor - it's a game-changer! While the regular oatmeal with added brown sugar is decent, it can't compare to the rich, velvety taste of the Maple and Brown Sugar variety. As for the Apples and Cinnamon flavor, it's passable, but it doesn't hold a candle to the star of the show. What I love most about this brand is how quick, easy, and satisfying it is - the perfect breakfast solution for busy mornings. I'll definitely be ordering from this brand again, and I'll be stocking up on the Maple and Brown Sugar flavor exclusively. If you're looking for a delicious and convenient breakfast option, look no further!",

Wash your hands after eating and avoid touching your eyes. You'll love these Ass-Kickin' Peanuts!\n\nP.S. I'm not sharing, and I might give my coworker Greg a jaw harp for Christmas as a joke.",
    "As a native of South Texas, where bold flavors and spicy dishes are a staple of our cuisine, I was underwhelmed by the lack of heat in these offerings. Frankly, I'm skeptical that habanero peppers were even used in the recipe. To truly do justice to the flavors of our region, I believe the spice level needs to be cranked up a notch or two. Anything less is a disservice to the rich culinary heritage of South Texas.",

The aroma is intense and long-lasting, while the flavor is smooth, rich, and full of life.",
    "We're obsessed with roasting our coffee beans in a large cast iron pan on the grill - it's a game-changer! We do it in batches, about 1/3 of the bag at a time, and the aroma that fills the air is absolutely incredible! And the taste? Absolutely divine! The roasted beans are smooth, rich, and utterly delicious, with no bitter aftertaste to speak of. We've had to send batches home with friends on multiple occasions because they just can't get enough of it - it's that good!",
    "I was thoroughly impressed with this deal! The shipment arrived promptly before Halloween, just as promised, and provided more than enough treats to satisfy all the trick-or-treaters. I'm also extremely pleased with the high quality of the product, and the best part is that it was significantly cheaper than what I would have paid at my local store for the same candy.",
    "I love this chocolate assortment! It has a great mix of all our family's favorite treats. With six of us, it doesn't last long. It's perfect and includes Kit Kats, Reeses, Take Fives, and more.",
    "I'm thrilled with this amazing product! The perfect blend of chocolates and ideal size made it a hit with the kids in our neighborhood. The generous bags were packed with goodies and arrived quickly. It was a sweet treat that brought smiles all around!",
    "Even though Halloween is behind us, I still sent in a bag of treats to my daughter's class for her to share with her friends. The fresh chocolate was a big hit and brought smiles to many faces!",
    "Be mindful of prices when considering this product. Although I was pleased with the assortment and managed to snag it at a discounted gold box price, I later discovered that Target offered it for $3-4 less. It's worth shopping around to ensure you get the best deal.",
    "I'm loving the mix of candies in this online bag - it's a dream come true! However, the price tag is a bit of a buzzkill. To give grocery stores a run for their money, they need to sweeten the deal and lower the cost. But aside from that, this bag is a sweet spot for anyone who shares my candy cravings!",
    "I received my order in 6 days, but unfortunately, all 6 bags were stale and inedible.",
    "I've been using Endurolytes for years, both in pill and powder form. When I'm out on long desert dirt bike rides, I always load up my CamelBak with the powder - it's not the tastiest thing, but it works like a charm. I never got a single cramp on those epic rides. Same deal when I'm desert racing in my buggy - the CamelBaks are always stocked with Endurolyte powder. But now, we've got the Fizz, and it's a total game-changer! First, it's from Hammer, so you know it's good stuff - endurance athletes all over the world swear by their products. Second, it's super convenient - just drop a tablet in water and it fizzes up into a refreshing drink. And third, it actually tastes amazing! Imagine getting a cool, fruity drink when you're parched and desperate for hydration and electrolytes. It's like a little party in your mouth! Now, my CamelBaks are all about the Fizz. I also like to drop a tablet in my bottled water whenever I'm exercising, and suddenly I've got a delicious, electrolyte-packed drink. Honestly, I can't recommend this stuff (or any Hammer product, for that matter) enough!",
    "This product has proven to be an effective source of electrolytes for me during and following extended periods of physical activity, such as running or cycling.\n\nI have had the opportunity to try all of the available flavors, and I must say that the grapefruit flavor is particularly appealing to me. Not only does it lack any unpleasant aftertaste, but I also appreciate the subtle carbonation it provides.\n\nIn addition to this product, I have also utilized other offerings from Hammer and have been consistently impressed with the quality of their entire product line.",
    "This product effectively prevents cramping during long rides. Simply add one to each water bottle and enjoy a cramp-free ride. The flavor is pleasant and easy to drink.",
    "As a low-carb dieter, I struggled with heart arrhythmia during long, hot bike rides. I suspected electrolytes were the issue, but Gatorade was too high in carbs. I tried \"zero-carb\" sports drinks, but they didn't help. Then I discovered these tablets at my bike shop, and they solved the problem! I've also shared them with friends who suffered from leg cramps, and they've seen resolution. These tablets are superbly formulated and simply work.",
    "I opted for the Mango flavor, but unfortunately, it fails to deliver on its promised taste. Instead of the sweet, fruity notes I expected, I'm met with a bland, unsweetened flavor profile. To make matters worse, a lingering aftertaste reminiscent of licorice lingers on the palate. As someone who has been consuming sports nutrition products for decades, I've developed a discerning palate and have grown accustomed to the taste of various products. Regrettably, the Mango flavor ranks among the least appealing I've encountered. While it's not unbearable, the unpleasant taste is noticeable with every sip, leaving a lasting impression.",
    "For those who, like myself, tend to act on impulse, a $6 investment may not be a significant deterrent. I must emphasize that the quality of these products is truly exceptional, and I have no criticisms to offer. However, upon further reflection, the price point does seem somewhat steep, particularly when factoring in the additional cost of shipping.",
    "Ugh, I'm still dreaming about how delicious those were! But, yeah, I have to admit, I totally inhaled them and now I'm paying the price - two pounds heavier! Guess that's what I get for not practicing a little more self-control",
    "The Albanese gummi confections, encompassing an assortment of bears, rings, and other whimsical shapes, are truly exceptional in terms of their delectable flavor and superior quality. The bears, in particular, boast adorable facial features that add to their charm. At my local candy store, these types of gummi treats, which come in a variety of forms such as bears, rings, snakes, balls, worms, and more, typically retail for around $10 per pound. In contrast, these twin packs featuring 4.5 or 5-pound bags offer an unbeatable value, in my opinion. I must confess that I have developed a voracious appetite for these delightful treats, having devoured a staggering 50 pounds of them thus far.",
    "I've had a hard time finding grape gummy bears in my area, and whenever I mention them to someone, they think I'm joking! So, I decided to take matters into my own hands and purchased 10 pounds of them.\n\nThese bears are slightly larger than those from other brands and have a tangy kick, although it's not overpowering. As a huge fan of grape-flavored candy and soda, I was thrilled to find these. While I think another company makes an even better version, these are a great value for the price.\n\nOne of my favorite ways to enjoy these gummy bears is by adding them to homemade Popsicles made with flavored sports drinks. The salt in the sports drink helps create softer Popsicles, and the frozen gummy bears are absolutely delicious!",
    "I picked up two of these babies and two raspberry lattice tarts from FantasiCakes' website for a dinner party I was throwing. They showed up fresh and in one piece, which was a relief! The size was perfect, too. I stashed half of them in the freezer for later. As a total pastry fanatic, I can honestly say these were the best I've ever had. The pastry was ridiculously soft, the jam was on point, and the flavor was amazing. They disappeared in no time, and my guests were totally wowed.",
    "**Important Cautionary Note: Maltitol Sensitivity**\n\nIt is essential to exercise caution when consuming products containing maltitol, a sugar alcohol that can be difficult for some individuals to digest. A significant number of people may experience adverse reactions to maltitol, which can manifest as severe intestinal bloating, cramping, and excessive gas production. Additional symptoms may include nausea, diarrhea, and headaches.\n\nPersonally, I learned about the potential drawbacks of maltitol the hard way. I initially fell in love with sugar-free chocolates that contained this sweetener, only to experience debilitating side effects shortly after consumption. The discomfort was unprecedented, characterized by intense abdominal cramping and bloating. Upon discontinuing the chocolate, all symptoms ceased, leading me to suspect that maltitol was the culprit.\n\nThis suspicion was later confirmed when I consumed sugar-free popcorn containing maltitol, which triggered the same adverse reactions, albeit to a lesser extent due to my limited consumption. It is crucial to recognize that while some individuals can tolerate maltitol without issue, others may be more susceptible to its negative effects.\n\nIf you experience similar symptoms after consuming products with maltitol, it is essential to acknowledge that it may not be a personal intolerance, but rather a specific reaction to this sweetener. Be aware of the potential risks associated with maltitol and take necessary precautions to ensure your comfort and well-being.",
    "**2/5 stars**",
    "This product has no real tea flavor at all. Instead, it's filled with a bunch of artificial flavors. Unfortunately, it's not returnable, so I wasted over $20 on it.",
    "I thought these would be a great addition to my trail mix, but unfortunately, they arrived as a solid block of melted chocolate. Even after leaving them in my pantry for a few days, they remained gooey at room temperature. I eventually stored them in the fridge, where I've been breaking off chunks to eat. While they still taste good to me, the chocolate has developed a grainy texture from melting and then solidifying again. Although I won't be ordering them online again, I would consider purchasing them in a store if I come across them.",
    "Indulge in the rich flavor of these treats - they're a game-changer! As a long-time fan of a similar brand, I was thrilled to discover that these goodies rival them in both taste and texture. A word of caution, though: be mindful of the season when you place your order. Without insulated packaging and ice packs, they're susceptible to melting in warm weather, just like any other chocolate delight. So, do yourself a favor and stock up during the cooler months - your taste buds will thank you!",
    "Delicious flavor, but unfortunately, the berries arrived melted. To fully appreciate the taste, I recommend ordering during colder months when the berries are more likely to arrive intact.",
    "I've never had tea this good. It's sweet but not too sweet, with a crisp taste that's perfect.",
    "This nostalgic peppermint stick is a sweet blast from the past! My dad surprised me with it on Christmas, recalling the joy it brought me in my childhood. Now, at 30, I'm thrilled to relive that magic and savor every delightful bite.",
    "What a phenomenal present for people of all ages! I've gifted these enormous, irresistible canes before, and the recipients were so enchanted that they cherished them as treasures, refusing to devour them - a true testament to their delight!",
    "Make Your Own Delicious Coffee Creamer with Molecular Gastronomy Powder\n\nTired of store-bought creamers filled with unhealthy fats? Want to create your own custom flavors? I discovered a game-changing solution using Molecular Gastronomy Powder, and I'm excited to share it with you.\n\nHere's my simple recipe:\n\n* Mix 1/3 Molecular Gastronomy Powder with 1/3 low-fat milk powder and 1/3 regular milk powder for a rich and creamy texture.\n* Add flavorings like cocoa bean powder, vanilla bean powder, and caster sugar to create unique flavors.\n* Experiment with spices like cinnamon and nutmeg to add depth.\n* Store your custom creamer in jelly canning jars and blend with a food chopper/processor to ensure the sugar dissolves evenly.\n\nThe result? A delicious, healthier creamer that tastes way better than store-bought options. Plus, it's fun to experiment with new flavors and ingredients! You can also customize the recipe to your taste preferences and dietary needs.\n\nAll the ingredients are available online, so take the time to experiment and create your own signature flavors. This makes a great housewarming or host/hostess gift too!",
    "I've tried various flavors of Natural Balance dog food with my itchy dogs, who have sensitivities. While they enjoy all the flavors, the lamb and rice variety surprisingly worsened their itching. In contrast, the duck and sweet potato formula significantly reduced their itching. I appreciate Natural Balance for its high-quality ingredients.",
    "I was initially impressed with this dog food, but unfortunately, it didn't agree with my Boston Terrier, who has severe food sensitivities. After feeding him this formula, his itching escalated to extreme scratching and restlessness at night, causing him to jump out of bed. However, once I switched to a different Natural Balance formula, the scratching ceased immediately. This experience highlights the importance of finding the right food for your pet, as every dog is different. It may take some trial and error to discover the best formula for your furry friend, but it's worth the effort to ensure their comfort and well-being.",
    "Our trio of furry friends can't get enough of this amazing dog food! We initially purchased it for one of our beloved canines who suffers from food allergies, and we're thrilled to report that it's been a game-changer for him. Since making the switch, we've seen a significant improvement in his health - no more uncomfortable hot spots or tummy troubles. And as if that wasn't enough, the convenience of having it delivered right to our doorstep with free shipping is the icing on the cake!",
    "I'm beyond thrilled to have finally found a dog food that works wonders for my poor pup! She's been struggling with a multitude of allergies - both environmental and food-related - and it's been a real challenge to find something that doesn't make her miserable. We thought we were on the right track with a prescription dog food, but it turned out she was allergic to something in that brand too! Can you believe it? But after getting her test results back, I was determined to find a solution. And then I stumbled upon this amazing dog food that's been a total game-changer! She still has her environmental triggers, of course, but at least I can rest easy knowing that her food isn't exacerbating the problem. It's such a relief to see her thriving and pain-free - I'm one happy pet parent!",
    "I've seen a significant improvement in my shepherd/collie mix's IBS symptoms since switching to a limited ingredient food, as recommended by our vet. Not only has it alleviated her discomfort, but she also seems to enjoy the taste. Plus, I've discovered that purchasing it from Amazon offers a cost-effective solution, with a $10 discount and the added convenience of free shipping!",
    "Miraculous Results with Natural Balance Dry Dog Food Lamb Meal and Brown Rice Recipe! \n\nAfter exhausting all options, I finally found a solution for my Jack Russell's severe food allergies with this recipe. It was our last resort, as every other food contained an allergen. But to my relief, she thrives on this formula, even eating it dry without issue. However, I often mix it with the Natural Balance Wet Lamb and Brown Rice for added palatability. The results are astounding! \n\nEncouraged by her progress, I introduced it to our Bichon as well, and she loves it just as much. If your furry friend suffers from allergies, stomach issues, or simply deserves a superior diet, look no further. This food has been a game-changer for us, and I'm confident you'll witness a remarkable transformation in your pet too!",
    "I am thoroughly impressed with the quality of this food. The concept of a single product suitable for all ages and breeds is truly convenient. Moreover, it has proven to be an excellent product. Since switching to this food, I have noticed a significant reduction in my three dogs' food intake, accompanied by a marked decrease in flatulence. Additionally, their stool has become consistently regular and of ideal consistency. It is indeed a testament to the product's excellence.",
    "My standard poodle and Pomeranian thrive on Natural Balance food. I've tried switching to cheaper alternatives, but I always end up returning to Natural Balance.",

    "I'm thrilled with this dog food, which suits canines of all ages. As a pet owner of a 3-year-old dog and a puppy, I've noticed a significant improvement in their overall health. Their coats are incredibly soft, and they rarely fall ill. Plus, with the convenience of Amazon Prime shipping, getting their favorite food delivered to my doorstep is a breeze!",
    "I'm thrilled to share that my super-picky golden retriever has finally found her perfect match - Natural Balance dog food! After trying out various brands, I was amazed to discover that she absolutely adores Natural Balance. And I'm not surprised - with their incredible range of flavors in both dry and wet varieties, it's a doggy paradise!\n\nI love mixing things up by combining her dry food with a splash of wet food, and my golden girl goes wild for it! Plus, I think it's paw-some that I can switch up the flavors each time to keep mealtime exciting and prevent boredom. (Although, I do have to admit that I steer clear of the fish-based options - let's just say they can be a bit... pungent!)\n\nBut here's the best part: I used to buy Natural Balance at Petco, but they only carried a limited selection of wet food cans. So, I decided to take the leap and order from Amazon instead - and boy, am I glad I did! Not only do they carry the entire range of Natural Balance products, but I also discovered that I can save a whopping $20 on each purchase! Talk about a win-win!\n\nAll in all, I'm absolutely delighted with Natural Balance dog food, and I wholeheartedly give it my stamp of approval. My furry friend can't get enough of it, and that's all the proof I need!",
    "I'm thrilled to get the same high-quality pet food delivered right to my doorstep, and the best part is that it's priced the same or even slightly lower than what I'd pay at the pet store!",
    "I've been thoroughly impressed with Natural Balance dog food. In the past, our dogs have struggled with other brands, leading me to suspect that they might have grain allergies. On the advice of a friend, I made the switch to Natural Balance's grain-free formula, and I'm thrilled to report that we've experienced no adverse reactions since. Another bonus is that they offer kibble in various sizes, catering to both larger and smaller breeds.",
    "My 1.5-year-old Basenji/Jack Russell mix thrives on this dog food. Since switching from regular dog food earlier this year, I've noticed a significant improvement in his overall health and energy levels. Although natural dog foods like Natural Balance are pricier, I've found that my dog consumes less of it and remains satisfied. In fact, he used to eat up to 3 cups of regular dog food daily, but now he only needs 1-1.5 cups of Natural Balance. This means that despite the higher cost, natural dog foods provide better value in the long run since you need to buy less to last just as long. Plus, you get the added benefits of a healthier and happier dog! With the convenience of free 2-day shipping through Amazon Prime, I'm completely convinced that Natural Balance is the way to go.",
    "My dog suffered from hotspots and itching due to allergies caused by other dog foods. I've found that cheap, widely available dog foods often contain harmful preservatives that can lead to health issues. However, this food has been a game-changer in reducing my dog's allergies, and they absolutely love it! - RAMSEY FrAnkenSteiN approved",
    "When we welcomed our lovable English Bulldog into our family at age 3, we soon discovered he was struggling with skin allergies. Our vet recommended a game-changing solution: transitioning him to a new, gentle food that would cater to his sensitive skin. After trying a few options, we landed on a limited-ingredient diet specifically designed for dogs like ours who react to common additives and proteins found in commercial dog food, such as chicken or beef. And the best part? It's been a lifesaver - his skin issues have been under control ever since!",
    "I was disappointed with this product when I tried it on my Golden Retriever. He showed no interest in eating it, and when he did, it caused him severe diarrhea. Unfortunately, the high price tag didn't match the poor results, so we won't be purchasing it again.",
    "The mouth says, 'How do I love thee, let me count the ways...' - a sentiment that perfectly captures the enthusiasm of Apple product enthusiasts. For fans of the brand, this item is a must-have. However, the only drawback is the high shipping cost, which is largely due to the product's substantial weight.",
    "Disappointment at the Doorstep: A Thawed Delivery and a Lesson in Exceptional Customer Service\n\nI was thrilled to receive my package, but my excitement was short-lived. Upon opening the box, I was dismayed to find that the contents had arrived slightly thawed. My parents, the intended recipients, were equally unimpressed and refused to accept the compromised goods.\n\nBut here's where the story takes a remarkable turn. The company behind the product proved to be a shining example of customer-centricity. They listened to my concerns, apologized for the inconvenience, and promptly issued a full refund. Their prompt and courteous response turned a negative experience into a positive one, earning them a loyal customer and a glowing review.",
    "The pastry shells of these tarts are absolutely delightful. While my husband is utterly enamored with them, I must admit I'm not entirely won over. To my palate, they're a tad too acidic and overpowering. However, I do enjoy the crust, and my husband is more than happy to take the filling off my hands. Interestingly, my kids are huge fans, so perhaps I'm just the odd one out in this case.",
    "These tartlets are absolutely divine! My husband and I are both huge fans, but we do agree with another customer's comment - the shipping cost is quite steep. In fact, it's more expensive to ship them than the tartlets themselves!",
    "I'm obsessed with this recipe! It's the perfect alternative to traditional apple pie, and the best part? No tedious slicing and dicing required! It's a breeze to prepare and I love that I can whip up a fresh batch whenever I need a sweet fix.",
    "I'm a huge fan of Crème Brûlée, and I was thrilled to discover how effortless these were to prepare. Simply sprinkle the included sugar on top and broil - it's that easy! The result is a visually stunning dessert that tastes amazing. My guests were impressed, thinking I had spent hours in the kitchen, when in reality it only took 5 minutes. I'll definitely be ordering more of these in the future!",
    "Fell short of my expectations, given the company's stellar reputation for delivering high-quality home products right to your doorstep.",
    "I discovered pickled asparagus at an Amish market and was immediately hooked. When I spotted them on sale at my local Safeway, I stocked up. Surprisingly, these pickles exceeded my expectations, even surpassing the quality of the ones I initially tried at the Amish market. What's more, some jars even included a bonus clove of garlic at the bottom. As a single person, I'm confident that the six-pack I plan to order will be thoroughly enjoyed and not go to waste.",
    "I recently discovered pickled asparagus and fell in love with this brand! It's so good that I bought a 6-pack and I'm already down to 2 jars - I'll need to restock soon!",
    "As I'm currently on a diet, I visited my local Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Grocery to explore healthy food options that are both delicious and low in calories. I ended up purchasing about a dozen items, including the Tillen Farms Pickled Crispy Asparagus. Being a fan of asparagus, I've tried several pickled asparagus brands before, but this one stands out as the best I've had. The flavor is exceptional, and I'm excited to enjoy the large clove of garlic at the bottom of the jar. What's even more impressive is that each jar contains only 60 calories! This is exactly the kind of diet food I'm looking for.",
    "I was thoroughly underwhelmed by the lackluster flavor and unappealing texture of this mix. As a fan of most Low Carb products, I was expecting a treat, but this one fell flat, leaving me feeling let down and disappointed.",
    "As a healthcare professional, I've had the pleasure of recommending this exceptional tea to my patients for years. Initially, it was only available for purchase at my office, but I'm thrilled that it's now accessible to a wider audience through online retailers like Amazon.com. I've witnessed firsthand how this tea has become an essential part of many people's daily routines, providing a soothing and flavorful alternative to coffee. Its popularity is a testament to its remarkable taste and benefits.",
    "I've been drinking Royal King 100% Natural Organic Green Tea every day for several years. I buy it in bulk to save on shipping. I used to drink a lot of coffee, but I realized it wasn't good for my health, so I quit. I tried different drinks to replace coffee and found that green tea tastes good and is healthy too. In my opinion, Royal King green tea is one of the best-tasting teas for the price. It has a nice golden color and a fresh taste. I like to add a little honey to make it sweeter and even healthier. Sometimes I treat myself to a more expensive tea, but Royal King is my everyday choice.\n\nThe only problems I have with this tea are that the packaging was different from what I expected, and I'm not sure if it's caffeine-free. Also, sometimes the tea bag tears when I unwrap it, so I have to be careful.",
    "One of the best teas I've ever had! It's clean, bright, and fresh. Great delivery and quality - I highly recommend giving it a try!",
    "I'm absolutely thrilled with this green tea! It's notoriously difficult to find in our local area, and online retailers often charge exorbitant prices for limited quantities. However, I was pleasantly surprised to receive a generous supply from this merchant at a reasonable cost. I will undoubtedly be placing future orders with this seller. Thank you for providing a reliable source for my daily green tea habit, which I've come to depend on!",
    "I highly recommend this tea, as it has been instrumental in helping me manage my appetite throughout the day. Its effectiveness has been so impressive that my mother and I have shared it with our friends, who have also benefited from its unique properties.",
    "As a native Italian who spent several years residing in Italy, I developed a fondness for a particular type of cookie that I would regularly enjoy with a traditional Italian espresso for breakfast. Upon relocating to the Bay Area, I was unable to find these cookies locally, which made their rediscovery all the more delightful.",
    "I was lucky enough to spend several sun-kissed summers in Italy during the 1980s, where I discovered a treasured treat that would become a lifelong obsession: biscotti. These crunchy, twice-baked wonders were a staple in Italian cafes, served with a steaming cup of coffee or a cold glass of milk as a breakfast pick-me-up or mid-day indulgence. Back then, they were a rare find in the US, but I couldn't resist bringing back a stash from my travels. Fast forward to today, and I'm thrilled to see that these Italian gems are now just a click away on Amazon! And the best part? The ritual of opening a fresh bag, inhaling the sweet aroma, pouring a glass of cold milk, and dipping those crunchy biscotti into the creamy goodness - it's a simple yet sublime pleasure that's sure to delight kids and adults alike.",
    "I tried a new cat food after hearing about it from a local pet store. My two cats, ages 3 and 6, liked it. The older male cat is overweight and picky, but he actually liked this food. I was happy to see him eating healthy food, even if it costs a bit more. I don't trust other cat foods that claim to be healthy but are really just filled with cornmeal.\n\nAfter 9 months, I'm still happy with this food. My cats are healthy and happy. The older male cat still eats too much, but that's just his nature. My female cat is tiny but energetic and healthy. I tried a different flavor, but my male cat preferred the original one. I'm going to try another flavor soon and will update my review.",
    "I noticed my 1-year-old cat was losing energy, so I switched him to a high-quality food from a pet store. After trying this brand, I've seen a significant improvement in his activity level and coat health over the past 8 months. He's now as energetic as he was as a kitten, and his coat is incredibly soft. He loves the taste too! I highly recommend this brand to anyone looking for a nutritious food for their pets.",
    "I've found the ideal food for my cat after extensive research, and my holistic veterinarian agrees. What sets it apart is the addition of probiotics to the kibble during the final stage of production, which is a crucial factor for me. The best part? My cat took to it instantly and refused to eat anything else, forcing me to switch to Holistic Select entirely.",
    "Miracle Food for My Feline Friend!\n\nI was at my wit's end when my 13-year-old cat, Cleo, started struggling to keep food down and was rapidly losing weight. That's when my vet recommended this amazing cat food, and it's been a game-changer! Not only has it put an end to her digestive issues, but Cleo is now more satisfied after meals, which means she's eating less and making the extra cost well worth it.\n\nThe best part? The dreaded \"smelly\" issues are a thing of the past! I had to share this with fellow cat parents who may be going through similar struggles, because trust me, this food is a lifesaver. The benefits are undeniable, and I'm so grateful to have found a solution that's brought my beloved Cleo back to her happy, healthy self.",
    "My beloved 4-year-old feline friend has been battling chronic urinary tract infections, and I've been on a mission to find the purr-fect solution. After some trial and error, I've discovered that a combination of this premium dry food, nutrient-rich wet food (with a splash of water for extra hydration), and Uri Ease has been a game-changer in keeping his UTIs at bay. I've learned that deviating from this formula can lead to a flare-up, so I'm willing to invest in his health and happiness. The best part? My other furry friends can't get enough of this delicious food either! While it may come with a higher price tag, seeing my kitty thrive makes it all worth it.",
    "I used to unknowingly fuel my cats' addiction to dry food, offering both canned and dry options without realizing the harm it could cause. Now, as a more informed pet owner, I regret not providing my four beloved cats - two 15-year-olds and two 5-year-olds - with premium quality canned food from the start, limiting their dry food intake. After discovering that only Wellness and Innova met their discerning tastes, I was dismayed to learn that Innova's manufacturer was acquired by Procter&Gamble. Determined to find a suitable replacement, I sampled various options from my local holistic pet store. The clear winner was Holistic Select, which my finicky felines devoured with gusto. If you're struggling to find a high-quality dry food that your picky eaters will love, I highly recommend giving Holistic Select a try - it's a game-changer!",
    "My veterinarian, who practices holistic medicine, suggested several brands, including Holistic Select. After trying them all, my cats showed a clear preference for this brand, particularly the sardine flavor. The most noticeable benefits are their luscious, clean coats and bright, clear eyes. Additionally, I've observed a significant reduction in the odor of their waste, which is a welcome change from the unpleasant smell often associated with commercial cat food. The health benefits of Holistic Select are undeniable, and I highly recommend it to other cat owners.",
    "I've got a kitty with some serious food allergies - fish and beef are major no-nos for her. Luckily, this formula is one of the few that agrees with her, and it's way better quality than the prescription stuff you get from the vet. My two furballs are super active, with coats that are ridiculously soft and shiny. And the best part? They're both at a healthy weight, not a bit of fluff in sight! Plus, the dry food really helps keep their teeth clean and tartar-free.",
    "Our feline friends are absolutely flourishing on this amazing dry cat food! The best part? A significant reduction in hairball throw-ups - it's a game-changer! Their coats are looking incredible, shiny and healthy. Plus, they're maintaining a fit and trim physique, no more unwanted weight gain! And let's not forget the incredible service from this vendor - lightning-fast shipping that's second to none! In our opinion, they're one of the top Amazon suppliers out there, hands down!",
    "Long-time fan of Hot & Spicy Maruchan Ramen! Perfect for spice lovers and ramen enthusiasts. Note: Much cheaper at Walmart ($3.36/12) than on Amazon.",
    "As a lifelong fan of Ramen noodles, I've tried many flavors, but none compare to Hot & Spicy Chicken. While it may not be spicy enough for seasoned chili lovers like myself, its unique flavor profile sets it apart as a standout favorite.",
    "I'm obsessed with spicy ramen, but unfortunately, it comes with a painful price - it sets my stomach ablaze and the burning sensation lingers for a grueling three hours! I'm not convinced this is doing my digestive system any favors. On a more positive note, you can pick up this affordable treat at Walmart for just $0.28, a significant steal compared to Amazon's prices.",
    "Ramen lovers rejoice! Imagine having your favorite quick and easy meal delivered right to your doorstep by the case, all at an unbeatable price on Amazon. It's a culinary dream come true!",
    "I'm not afraid to admit that this soup is a scorcher! As someone who usually revels in spicy dishes with depth of flavor, I'm disappointed to find that this one falls flat. The intense heat overwhelms any potential flavor, leaving me feeling like I'm sipping on a blaze rather than a delicious meal.",
    "I was pleasantly surprised by the bold, spicy kick of these noodles. Unlike my usual preference, I found the savory broth to be the real star of the show, outshining the noodles themselves. However, it's worth noting that those who are sensitive to heat may find them overwhelming, while fans of extremely spicy food might find them lacking in intensity.",
    "I scored an amazing deal on these instant lunches, paying only about 25 cents per cup - a steal compared to my local grocery stores, which often don't even carry the spicy flavors I love. As a busy professional, I need quick and easy snacks to fuel my workday. These instant lunches are a lifesaver, especially when I'm short on time and can't take a break for a proper meal. The spicy flavor is a personal favorite, and I'll definitely be stocking up whenever it's on sale again!",
    "I've acquired a diverse range of flavors, and this particular one has emerged as a standout among my preferences, prompting me to replenish my stock soon.",
    "I'm obsessed with this ramen flavor! It's ruined me for all other flavors - they just can't compare to the rich, savory taste of this one. And the best part? I can get it delivered right to my doorstep in just two days with my Prime membership, no shipping costs attached. But, let's be real, the price on Amazon is still no match for the deal I can score at my local grocery store. A quick trip to the store and I can snag a whole case of this goodness for a steal!",
    "I'm thrilled to share that this ginger investment has been a game-changer for me! The quality is unparalleled, boasting a satisfying fibrous texture reminiscent of fresh ginger, accompanied by a delightful spicy kick. The added sugar perfectly balances out the flavor, creating a harmonious blend. Considering the exceptional value of 5 pounds for $40, I'd say it's an absolute steal. I'm already looking forward to restocking soon, as this ginger has become an essential topping for my signature ginger cupcakes and cookies.",
    "I'm thrilled to have found a delicious alternative to Australian ginger, which is unavailable in my local area. This product rivals the quality of Australian ginger I've purchased in other cities, and the best part is that I can now enjoy it from the comfort of my own home, without having to travel!",
    "I'm obsessed with this ginger! I've wasted my time and money on cheaper brands, but let me tell you, this one is TOTALLY WORTH IT! The quality is unparalleled - it's always tender, moist, and consistently delicious. I'll never go back to those other brands again!",
    "My son has suffered from acid reflux since infancy and has been prescribed numerous medications, none of which have provided any significant relief. However, an encounter with an elderly gentleman at his workplace led to the recommendation of a particular product, which I promptly ordered for him. Given our extensive experience with various treatments, I was skeptical about its potential efficacy. Nevertheless, I was pleasantly surprised to observe a remarkable improvement in his condition. Since incorporating one piece of this ginger supplement into his daily morning routine, starting from the second day, he has been completely symptom-free, including the absence of heartburn. He is now able to consume a wide range of foods without any discomfort and genuinely enjoys his meals. This product has been a blessing for him, and I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the manufacturers.",
    "I purchased this product for our office as a sweet snack option for my colleagues. The bite-sized pieces are perfect for grabbing a quick treat, eliminating the need to commit to an entire licorice stick. However, I did experience one issue - one of the bags arrived damaged, having broken open during shipping.",
    "Twizzlers licorice stands out from the competition, offering a superior taste experience. If you can find a deal for $2 to $2.50 per package with free shipping, it's a great value. The black and cherry flavors are particularly noteworthy, but the strawberry flavor falls short, with a taste that's too subtle and barely noticeable.",
    "I'm absolutely obsessed with these - they're incredibly delicious! To be honest, I think I've become addicted to them. Buying them in bulk, six bags at a time, is way more cost-effective than purchasing individual bags at Target. I save around a dollar per bag, which adds up! I take advantage of the subscribe and save feature for these and several other products. I'm a huge fan of subscribe and save - it's a game-changer!",
    "For a convenient and mess-free alternative to traditional licorice, consider these soft and easy-to-chew treats. They're perfect for on-the-go snacking, especially during summer outings or at the beach, as they won't leave sticky residue on hands or surfaces. We appreciate the variety of flavors offered and often combine them with chocolate for a delightful snack. This product offers excellent value at a great price, and we highly recommend it.",
    "It seems to me that the pieces in this bag have been downsized. If that's the case, it's likely an attempt to make the buyer feel like they're getting a better value due to the increased quantity. However, the issue is that the pieces need to be a certain size to provide sufficient flavor. As it stands, you need to use 2-3 pieces to equal the original size, which compromises the overall eating experience.",
    "As a long-time fan of Newman's Pineapple salsa, I sought a comparable alternative. I found it in Berry Mango salsa, which is one of the best-tasting salsas I've had. My daughters also love it, appreciating its smooth texture and small mango pieces. The flavor is balanced, with just the right amount of sweetness and a subtle kick. At this price, it's an excellent value.",
    "The salsa smelled delicious, and I think it probably was. However, the packer at Amazon did a poor job, especially with the bottoms of the bottles. As a result, all three bottles arrived broken.\n\nWhen I tried to reach for my computer to initiate a return, I was told that returns are not accepted for food items. I then looked for a customer service tag, but I couldn't find one on Amazon's new website design.\n\nAmazon seems to be proud of their new design, but they should at least provide a way to contact them in emergency situations. As a frequent customer, I buy a lot of items, and they all come in styrofoam boxes. I would never ship fragile items, especially salsa in glass containers, in a cardboard box with just a strip of large bubble wrap. No matter how careful the carrier (FedEx) is, it's going to break somewhere along the line.\n\n- Barbara L. S.",
    "This salsa is one of the best I've had in a while, but avoid the variety pack - the other two flavors aren't worth the cost.",
    "* The product reminds the writer of homemade dog treats made with pumpkin and cinnamon.\n* The writer finds the product bland and not their favorite from Back To Nature.\n* However, their fiancé loves the product, which is why it received 3 stars.",
    "I'm thrilled with this exceptional cornmeal! It yielded phenomenal results in both my traditional cornbread and hot water cornbread recipes. Moreover, I used it to coat oysters before frying, and it added a delightful crunch and burst of flavor to the dish.",
    "Get ready to elevate your chicken game with this show-stopping marinade! Whether you're firing up the grill or baking to perfection in the oven, this flavor-packed formula is sure to impress. I've even served it up at dinner parties and received a standing ovation from my guests! The best part? It's a total steal - affordable and effortless to use. Trust me, this marinade is a culinary superstar that's sure to earn you rave reviews!",
    "Unleash the Flavor in Your Favorite Proteins!\n\nDiscover the secret to mouth-watering meals with our versatile seasoning blend, perfectly suited for chicken, fish, beef, or pork. Not only is it quick and easy to use, but it will also elevate the taste of your dishes to new heights!\n\nAnd the best part? Buying in bulk saves you a whopping 50% or more compared to traditional box stores. Stock up and savor the flavor without breaking the bank!",
    "I surprised my brother, who's following the Jorge Cruise diet, with this treat and ended up trying one myself - and I was pleasantly surprised by how delicious it is!",
    "Attention coffee lovers! Be aware that you can find a better deal on your favorite hazelnut coffee creamer singles at local stores. They typically cost between $2.50 and $3.36 for a box of 24, but Amazon is currently selling them for $9.99 - almost triple the price! As a fan of hazelnut creamer myself, I want to warn you that this online deal isn't the best value for your money.",
    "I'm thrilled with this product! I chose it as a healthier alternative to traditional desserts and I'm so glad I did. The best part is that you can get creative with Jello desserts and still enjoy great taste while making a healthier choice. I'll definitely be buying this again - the flavor is absolutely wonderful!",
    "After searching four grocery stores for a specific flavor of Jello to use in my green tomato jam recipe, I finally found it here. I'm thrilled to report that this Jello is absolutely wonderful! It's surprising that it's only available in stores during the summer, which made it impossible to find in town during the fall harvest season. The flavor is reminiscent of sweet watermelon, and when used in my jam recipe, it creates a delicious watermelon jam taste. It's also great when made as regular Jello - simply yummy!",
    "Discover the numerous health benefits of using this premium salt, considered one of the healthiest options available. With its generous quantity, this box is expected to last our family of [insert number] for at least a year, making it a great value. Unlike regular salt, iodized sea salt is a healthier alternative that won't contribute to increased blood pressure, providing a safer choice for those with hypertension concerns.",
    "Elevate every meal with our perfectly portioned sea salt, ideal for both tabletop and outdoor adventures! We're obsessed with its performance - it shakes effortlessly, never clumps, and flows smoothly, ensuring the perfect seasoning every time.",
    "<span class=\"tiny\">Duration: 0:26 minutes</span>\n\nThe product's expiration date is 21 months from the date of purchase. The tuna and tomato combination is particularly flavorful. This item is one of several products that I regularly reorder from Amazon on a monthly basis.\n\nEdit: I have added a brief video to provide a visual representation of this product combination.\n\nPlease note that I was wearing a headlamp while filming, but unfortunately, the focus on the tuna was not optimal. While a re-filming may be warranted, it appears that this product does not receive a significant number of views.",
    "As a long-time fan of traditional tuna brands like Starkist and Chicken of the Sea, I was skeptical about trying SAFCOL, a brand I'd never heard of before. But I was pleasantly surprised to discover that it held its own against the big names, and even offered a more subtle flavor profile with less seasoning.",
    "In my opinion, these tuna packs are the epitome of flavor and convenience. They make for a perfect on-the-go snack that's not only delicious but also incredibly satisfying, especially when paired with the tangy sweetness of tomato. Whether you're fueling up for a busy day or need a quick pick-me-up, these tuna packs are the ideal choice - a truly unbeatable combination of taste and convenience!",
    "I switched from Star-Kist to try this brand, but the tuna tasted bad due to excessive basil and spices.",
    "As a self-proclaimed tuna addict, I decided to try Safcol's tuna despite being unfamiliar with the brand. The tuna itself tastes like high-quality fish, but I was underwhelmed by the tomato basil flavor, which I found to be somewhat bland. While it's an improvement over plain tuna, it didn't quite live up to my expectations. Nevertheless, it remains a great option for those looking for a low-calorie, low-fat meal.",
    "I was pleasantly surprised by the superior taste of this product compared to regular tuna pouches. The quality is excellent, and it's delicious on its own - no need to add extra seasonings!\n\nI heated it in the microwave on 20% power for just 1 minute, and it was perfect. I think a quick warm-up really brings out the flavor.",
    "While this product lacked flavor, its 100-calorie count makes it a better option than a Special K bar or cookie snack pack. To enhance the taste, I recommend adding your own seasonings or pairing it with something else to balance out the flavor.",
    "I recently came across pomegranate molasses and felt compelled to give it a try. Although I have not yet had the opportunity to incorporate it into a recipe, I have been sampling it in small quantities and am thoroughly impressed. The molasses boasts a rich, dark, and syrupy consistency, with a tangy, slightly sweet flavor profile. A small amount is sufficient to satisfy my sweet tooth, and I find the unique flavor, which features a subtle metallic undertone, to be particularly appealing. I am eager to experiment with this ingredient further, with plans to prepare fesenjan in the near future.",
    "I used this in Moroccan dishes, as a sweetener in a tasty drink, and as a topping on oranges flavored with orange water. It's amazing!",
    "I recently discovered a package of beans that had been stored for an extended period of time. Unfortunately, they had deteriorated to the point where they were no longer suitable for cooking. Upon inspection, I found that approximately half of the beans had damaged skins, a clear indication that they had exceeded their shelf life. As food items are not eligible for return or refund, I was unable to seek compensation for the defective product. As a result, I will be seeking an alternative brand for future use. In the meantime, I am left with approximately fifty servings of unusable beans that must be discarded.",
    "These miniature impostors may mimic the appearance and texture of banana Runts, but don't be fooled - they're a flavorless flop! The taste is a far cry from the sweet, fruity goodness of the real deal, and instead, they're a disappointing, yucky substitute. I'm left with no choice but to try and return them to the vendor, hoping to get a refund for this unsatisfying experience.",
    "Overall, the item was satisfactory, but I was disappointed to find that the Banana Heads were significantly smaller than expected, unlike the standard Banana Runts. Additionally, the packaging was subpar, which resulted in the Banana Heads spilling out of their container during shipping and scattering throughout the packing envelope upon arrival.",
    "I bought these bags for a Jungle-themed baby shower giveaway, and they turned out to be the perfect fit for 25 small bags of candy. Since I purchased a 5-pound bag, I'd recommend opting for a larger size if you need to fill more than 25 bags.",
    "I've been a fan of Ricore since my mother first allowed me to drink caffeine. I adore it in milk - it's so much smoother and tastier than instant coffee. As a French expat living in the US, I make it a point to bring back boxes of Ricore whenever I can. Another hidden gem worth trying is Savora - definitely check it out!",
    "I was introduced to this delightful drink by my mother, who brought it back from her trip to her hometown in Brittany, France. I was immediately hooked! While I wish it were more affordable, I absolutely adore this product.",
    "Indulge in the Ultimate Breakfast Delight: FantasiCakes 8\" Cinnamon Coffee Cake!\n\nImagine sinking your teeth into a moist, flavorful, and generously sized coffee cake, packed with the richness of fresh eggs, creamy sour cream, and the warmth of Madagascar Bourbon Vanilla. The crowning glory? A crunchy cinnamon streusel topping and filling that will leave you craving for more. And the best part? This heavenly treat is available online for just $18.95!\n\nAs a self-proclaimed cinnamon coffee cake connoisseur, I was blown away by FantasiCakes' masterpiece. The cake arrived promptly, carefully packaged to ensure its arrival in near-perfect condition. The bonus? A large tub of creamy white icing to drizzle over the top, adding an extra layer of sweetness and indulgence.\n\nThe cake's generous size fed my family of five for three delightful breakfasts, with its thick, sponge-like texture and incredible moistness leaving us all satisfied. The flavors are truly sublime, with the sticky cinnamon exterior giving way to a sweet, swirled interior of cinnamon and vanilla. The icing is the perfect finishing touch, adding a sticky sweetness that complements the cake beautifully.\n\nPair this masterpiece with your morning coffee, and you'll be treated to the ultimate breakfast experience. Trust me, FantasiCakes' 8\" Cinnamon Coffee Cake is a game-changer!",
    "I used to be a big fan of this brand's water and lemon juice, but I stopped buying it about 5-6 years ago. The product used to be very potent, and I loved the intense flavor it provided. However, I think the formula has changed over time, making it less strong and more diluted. As a result, it's not as effective and doesn't have the same kick it used to. While it's still a good product, the taste is now comparable to cheaper brands. I wish it still had the same strong flavor it once did.",
    "I have had the pleasure of trying several lemon juices, and this particular brand stands out as one of the best. The exceptional quality of this product has earned my loyalty, and I have become a repeat customer. During periods when fresh lemons are scarce, this juice is an excellent substitute, providing a reliable source of citrus flavor for both culinary and refreshment purposes.\n\nI intend to continue purchasing this product in the future.",
    "This lemon juice is an essential staple in my kitchen throughout the year. Its robust flavor profile allows for effective seasoning with minimal usage, thereby elevating the flavor of various dishes. I also incorporate it into my daily routine by adding a splash to my water almost daily.\n\nI intend to continue purchasing this product repeatedly in the future.",
    "The convenience of having a trusted staple in your pantry! This lemon juice concentrate is a game-changer, offering the same quality you'd find in stores, but with the added bonus of being readily available whenever inspiration strikes. No more tedious squeezing or scrambling to find fresh lemons - this concentrate is the perfect solution for elevating your sauces, dressings, and more with a burst of citrus flavor.",
    "Honestly, this isn't quite as amazing as the Frozen Lemon juice, but it's still pretty good. The flavor's a bit off, maybe due to some preservative or something. You know what I wish? That I could just order the frozen stuff online!",
    "This drink is extremely relaxing, but be warned: only consume it before bed or a nap, as it's not suitable for driving or other activities. It induces a deep relaxation, making my limbs tingle and my eyes droop, transporting me to a tranquil state. I'm a huge fan!",
    "I scored these at Grocery Outlet in the Seattle-Tacoma area for just $4 a case of 12 - no way was I paying $38! That's like 3 for a buck! The taste is pretty meh, but I don't hate it, and they're low-calorie to boot. I'll def grab more, just not at that crazy price.",
    "I highly recommend this product! It tastes great and delivers on its promise, providing a superb natural sleep aid that truly works.",
    "In our relentless pursuit of a restful night's sleep, we've been exploring alternative approaches to combat the debilitating effects of chronic stress and hectic lifestyles. While a yoga class might be the ideal solution, this product offers a commendable alternative. Its unique formula effectively induces a peaceful slumber and ensures a restful night's sleep. I found that consuming half the recommended dose on the first night was sufficient, and within 30 minutes, I was ready to retire to bed. The next morning, I awoke feeling refreshed and revitalized, without the groggy aftereffects often associated with sleep aids.\n\nDespite the product's exceptional quality, I was compelled to deduct two stars from my rating due to the subpar packaging. Unfortunately, the product arrived with two shattered glass bottles, resulting in a significant loss of $6. The packaging was woefully inadequate, consisting of a single layer of small-bubbled bubble wrap wrapped around the case, which was then placed in a larger box with excessive empty space. This oversight notwithstanding, the product itself is truly remarkable.",
    "Get ready for a game-changing cookie experience! We took the classic chocolate chip cookie to new heights by swapping in BRM Garbanzo Bean Flour, and the results were nothing short of phenomenal! The rich brown sugar and decadent chocolate chips perfectly balanced out any hint of bean flavor, leaving our friends utterly clueless that they were devouring a gluten-free treat. The texture was sublime - chewy, elastic, and utterly irresistible, just like traditional cookies made with regular flour. But here's the best part: these powerhouse cookies packed a nutritional punch, boasting high protein and fiber levels (a whopping 2-3g of fiber per cookie!) that left us feeling full and satisfied with smaller portions. And as an added bonus, the lower glycemic index meant we could indulge without the guilt. Trust us, BRM Garbanzo Bean Flour is a total winner - even if you only use it to make these incredible cookies!",
    "I'm thoroughly impressed with this product! It helped me bake a delicious banana bread. The quality is exceptional and the price is unbeatable - the lowest in town!",
    "Tired of scouring local grocery stores in vain? We were too - until we discovered this game-changing solution! With lightning-fast delivery, we said goodbye to the frustrating hunt up and down the flour aisle and hello to convenience!",
    "I'm about to whip up a fresh fruit tart for a pie auction at church, thanks to a friend's request for something strawberry-themed. The secret to making these gorgeous European-style tarts is this packet of glaze. It's a game-changer! Simply bake a base, layer on fresh sliced fruit, and pour the glaze over top. It sets at room temperature, holds the fruit in place, and shows off your beautiful arrangement.\n\nI've also seen this glaze used on cheesecakes to keep the fruit topping in place. Not a huge cheesecake fan myself (too rich!), but a fruit-topped cheesecake is stunning. Just layer sliced fruit on top of the cheesecake, pour on the glaze, and let it set before removing the springform pan. Cherries, strawberries, or mango work well, but I once had a cheesecake with poached lemon slices that was amazing!\n\nFor the base, I use sponge cake baked in a shallow pan, but you can also use pate sucre (like a sugar cookie) in those fluted pans. Mini-tarts in a muffin pan are also a great option - just pre-bake the pie crust, fill with fresh fruit, and glaze away! Some people add a layer of creme patisserie (like custard) underneath the fruit, and I have to say, it's a winner.\n\nIf you're into baking, this glaze is a must-have in your pantry. Plus, it's vegan-friendly, made with tapioca starch, carrageenan, and other plant-based ingredients. So, whether you're making a vegan tofu cheesecake or a fruit tart with a nut crust, this glaze has got you covered!",
    "I was thrilled to see a remarkable improvement in my Scottish Terriers' skin health after using this product. Within just a week, the pesky hot spots that had been plaguing them completely disappeared. While the scent is quite potent, I found it to be manageable and not overwhelming. The benefits far outweigh any minor drawbacks, and I'm so glad I gave it a try!",
    "I was thrilled to discover this affordable coffee alternative that not only matches Ganocafe in quality but also boasts the added benefits of organic reishi mushroom and other healthy antioxidants - all at a fraction of the cost! I was pleasantly surprised by its rich flavor, which exceeded my expectations. After just a few days of enjoying it, I can confidently say that it's a steal for only $5. In fact, I'm so impressed that I'm introducing my sisters, who are all Ganocafe fans, to this more budget-friendly option. I'll be sure to follow up on this product in a few weeks to share my continued experience with it.",
    "I was underwhelmed by this coffee's flavor profile, which lacked the richness I've come to expect from brands like Nescafe and Mount Hagen. While I appreciate the attempt to offer something unique, this coffee's subtle 'vitaminy' note didn't quite win me over. The price point also felt a bit steep for the quality received. Unfortunately, I don't see myself repurchasing this one.",
    "This coffee is great! It's made with all organic ingredients, no pesticides, and not only tastes good but also offers the healing effects of ganoderma.",
    "So, I'm with the others on this - this coffee is seriously tasty! I've had my fair share of instant coffees, but this one's definitely up there. If you're looking for another good option (just FYI, not organic), I'd recommend checking out 'Africafe pure instant coffee' - it's one of my faves!",
    "I'm obsessed with this amazing product! Not only does it taste incredible, but it also gives me a boost of energy without any annoying jitters. I'm totally hooked! My only suggestion would be to upgrade the packaging to a resealable jar or hard plastic container - the zip-lock pouch just didn't cut it for me (literally, it ripped and stopped working after a while!). But let's be real, the product itself is absolute perfection, and I'm willing to overlook the packaging flaws for now!",
    "These bite-sized treats are both delicious and revitalizing.\n\nAs someone who typically has salads for lunch, I've found that they can sometimes leave my breath less than fresh. To combat this, I make it a habit to enjoy two of these mints after my meal (thanks to their compact size). I've discovered that this simple routine effectively eliminates any lingering odor.\n\nI appreciate that they're sugar-free, as sugar can actually contribute to the growth of bacteria that cause bad breath. Plus, they're flavorful enough that I almost consider them a part of my lunch itself.\n\nThis bulk purchase offers great value, and I highly recommend the mints. Kudos!",
    "I'm obsessed with these premium Altoids - they blow the regular ones out of the water! But be warned: they come with a heftier price tag, so you'll want to make sure you're absolutely hooked before making the splurge.",
    "I scored an amazing deal on these tiny tins of sugar-free mints! They're perfect for tossing in your bag or pocket when you're on the move. With 50 mints per tin, it's just the right amount to carry around. Plus, they're way better for your teeth than the sugary kind. And the best part? They're only 12 bucks, which is super reasonable. They're also great for sharing with friends. If you're in the market for a new mint, give these a try - you won't regret it!",
    "I'm very satisfied with this product. The advantages are:\n\n* The packaging and shipping were good, and the price was reasonable.\n* The product had a long shelf life, with about a year left before expiration when I received it. This allowed me to enjoy/share 9 boxes.\n* The mint flavor is strong and refreshing, not too overpowering like some wintergreen products, and it's not in a powdery form.\n\nI don't have any complaints or negative comments about this product.",
    "Be mindful of your consumption of these treats, as they contain a chemical similar to that found in laxatives. It's best to enjoy them in moderation to avoid any potential discomfort.",
    "These mints boast an intense flavor and a compact size, making them easy to take on-the-go and store in a pocket or purse.",
    "I have an abundant stockpile of these on hand. I'm currently utilizing them and have a surplus available. This approach is far more efficient than purchasing a single unit from a grocery store or convenience store each time you crave a mint.",
    "I've noticed that even with smaller containers, they're not always filled to the brim. Take these adorable little tins, for example - they're less than half full! Considering the price, it feels a bit steep. I wonder, is there a super-special ingredient in there that's really expensive? Or maybe, like with cereal, they're filled up at the factory but settle during transport? It would be great if manufacturers could be more transparent about their packaging and pricing. That way, we could all feel better about what we're buying."
