    "I have bought several of the Vitality canned dog food products and have found them all to be of good quality. The product looks more like a stew than a processed meat and it smells better. My Labrador is finicky and she appreciates this product better than  most.",
    "Product arrived labeled as Jumbo Salted Peanuts...the peanuts were actually small sized unsalted. Not sure if this was an error or if the vendor intended to represent the product as \"Jumbo\".",
    "This is a confection that has been around a few centuries.  It is a light, pillowy citrus gelatin with nuts - in this case Filberts. And it is cut into tiny squares and then liberally coated with powdered sugar.  And it is a tiny mouthful of heaven.  Not too chewy, and very flavorful.  I highly recommend this yummy treat.  If you are familiar with the story of C.S. Lewis' \"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe\" - this is the treat that seduces Edmund into selling out his Brother and Sisters to the Witch.",
    "If you are looking for the secret ingredient in Robitussin I believe I have found it.  I got this in addition to the Root Beer Extract I ordered (which was good) and made some cherry soda.  The flavor is very medicinal.",
    "Great taffy at a great price.  There was a wide assortment of yummy taffy.  Delivery was very quick.  If your a taffy lover, this is a deal.",
    "I got a wild hair for taffy and ordered this five pound bag. The taffy was all very enjoyable with many flavors: watermelon, root beer, melon, peppermint, grape, etc. My only complaint is there was a bit too much red/black licorice-flavored pieces (just not my particular favorites). Between me, my kids, and my husband, this lasted only two weeks! I would recommend this brand of taffy -- it was a delightful treat.",
    "This saltwater taffy had great flavors and was very soft and chewy.  Each candy was individually wrapped well.  None of the candies were stuck together, which did happen in the expensive version, Fralinger's.  Would highly recommend this candy!  I served it at a beach-themed party and everyone loved it!",
    "This taffy is so good.  It is very soft and chewy.  The flavors are amazing.  I would definitely recommend you buying it.  Very satisfying!!",
    "Right now I'm mostly just sprouting this so my cats can eat the grass. They love it. I rotate it around with Wheatgrass and Rye too",
    "This is a very healthy dog food. Good for their digestion. Also good for small puppies. My dog eats her required amount at every feeding.",
    "I don't know if it's the cactus or the tequila or just the unique combination of ingredients, but the flavour of this hot sauce makes it one of a kind!  We picked up a bottle once on a trip we were on and brought it back home with us and were totally blown away!  When we realized that we simply couldn't find it anywhere in our city we were bummed.<br /><br />Now, because of the magic of the internet, we have a case of the sauce and are ecstatic because of it.<br /><br />If you love hot sauce..I mean really love hot sauce, but don't want a sauce that tastelessly burns your throat, grab a bottle of Tequila Picante Gourmet de Inclan.  Just realize that once you taste it, you will never want to use any other sauce.<br /><br />Thank you for the personal, incredible service!",
    "One of my boys needed to lose some weight and the other didn't.  I put this food on the floor for the chubby guy, and the protein-rich, no by-product food up higher where only my skinny boy can jump.  The higher food sits going stale.  They both really go for this food.  And my chubby boy has been losing about an ounce a week.",
    "My cats have been happily eating Felidae Platinum for more than two years. I just got a new bag and the shape of the food is different. They tried the new food when I first put it in their bowls and now the bowls sit full and the kitties will not touch the food. I've noticed similar reviews related to formula changes in the past. Unfortunately, I now need to find a new food that my cats will eat.",
    "good flavor! these came securely packed... they were fresh and delicious! i love these Twizzlers!",
    "The Strawberry Twizzlers are my guilty pleasure - yummy. Six pounds will be around for a while with my son and I.",
    "My daughter loves twizzlers and this shipment of six pounds really hit the spot. It's exactly what you would expect...six packages of strawberry twizzlers.",
    "I love eating them and they are good for watching TV and looking at movies! It is not too sweet. I like to transfer them to a zip lock baggie so they stay fresh so I can take my time eating them.",
    "I am very satisfied with my Twizzler purchase.  I shared these with others and we have all enjoyed them.  I will definitely be ordering more.",
    "Twizzlers, Strawberry my childhood favorite candy, made in Lancaster Pennsylvania by Y & S Candies, Inc. one of the oldest confectionery Firms in the United States, now a Subsidiary of the Hershey Company, the Company was established in 1845 as Young and Smylie, they also make Apple Licorice Twists, Green Color and Blue Raspberry Licorice Twists, I like them all<br /><br />I keep it in a dry cool place because is not recommended it to put it in the fridge. According to the Guinness Book of Records, the longest Licorice Twist ever made measured 1.200 Feet (370 M) and weighted 100 Pounds (45 Kg) and was made by Y & S Candies, Inc. This Record-Breaking Twist became a Guinness World Record on July 19, 1998. This Product is Kosher! Thank You",
    "Candy was delivered very fast and was purchased at a reasonable price.  I was home bound and unable to get to a store so this was perfect for me.",
    "My husband is a Twizzlers addict.  We've bought these many times from Amazon because we're government employees living overseas and can't get them in the country we are assigned to.  They've always been fresh and tasty, packed well and arrive in a timely manner.",
    "I bought these for my husband who is currently overseas. He loves these, and apparently his staff likes them also.<br />There are generous amounts of Twizzlers in each 16-ounce bag, and this was well worth the price. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GVISJM\">Twizzlers, Strawberry, 16-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)</a>",
    "I can remember buying this candy as a kid and the quality hasn't dropped in all these years. Still a superb product you won't be disappointed with.",
    "I have lived out of the US for over 7 yrs now, and I so miss my Twizzlers!!  When I go back to visit or someone visits me, I always stock up.  All I can say is YUM!<br />Sell these in Mexico and you will have a faithful buyer, more often than I'm able to buy them right now.",

    "The candy is just red , No flavor . Just  plan and chewy .  I would never buy them again",
    "I was so glad Amazon carried these batteries.  I have a hard time finding them elsewhere because they are such a unique size.  I need them for my garage door opener.<br />Great deal for the price.",
    "I got this for my Mum who is not diabetic but needs to watch her sugar intake, and my father who simply chooses to limit unnecessary sugar intake - she's the one with the sweet tooth - they both LOVED these toffees, you would never guess that they're sugar-free and it's so great that you can eat them pretty much guilt free!  i was so impressed that i've ordered some for myself (w dark chocolate) to take to the office so i'll eat them instead of snacking on sugary sweets.<br />These are just EXCELLENT!",

    "I have never been a huge coffee fan. However, my mother purchased this little machine and talked me into trying the Latte Macciato. No Coffee Shop has a better one and I like most of the other products, too (as a usually non-coffee drinker!).<br />The little Dolche Guesto Machine is super easy to use and prepares a really good Coffee/Latte/Cappuccino/etc in less than a minute (if water is heated up). I would recommend the Dolce Gusto to anyone. Too good for the price and I'am getting one myself! :)",
    "This offer is a great price and a great taste, thanks Amazon for selling this product.<br /><br />Staral",
    "McCann's Instant Oatmeal is great if you must have your oatmeal but can only scrape together two or three minutes to prepare it. There is no escaping the fact, however, that even the best instant oatmeal is nowhere near as good as even a store brand of oatmeal requiring stovetop preparation.  Still, the McCann's is as good as it gets for instant oatmeal. It's even better than the organic, all-natural brands I have tried.  All the varieties in the McCann's variety pack taste good.  It can be prepared in the microwave or by adding boiling water so it is convenient in the extreme when time is an issue.<br /><br />McCann's use of actual cane sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup helped me decide to buy this product.  Real sugar tastes better and is not as harmful as the other stuff. One thing I do not like, though, is McCann's use of thickeners.  Oats plus water plus heat should make a creamy, tasty oatmeal without the need for guar gum. But this is a convenience product.  Maybe the guar gum is why, after sitting in the bowl a while, the instant McCann's becomes too thick and gluey.",
    "This is a good instant oatmeal from the best oatmeal brand.  It uses cane sugar instead of high fructouse corn syrup, so not only does it have a better sweetness, but some doctors now say that this form of sugar is better for you.  Great on a cold morning when you don't have time to make McCann's Steel Cut Oats.  The apple cinnamon is the best but the maple and brown sugar or the regular are good too.  Plus they don't require doctoring to actually tell the three flavors apart.",
    "Instant oatmeal can become soggy the minute the water hits the bowl. McCann's Instant Oatmeal holds its texture, has excellent flavor, and is good for you all at the same time. McCann's regular oat meal is excellent, too, but may take a bit longer to prepare than most have time for in the morning. This is the best instant brand I've ever eaten, and a very close second to the non-instant variety.<br /><br />McCann's Instant Irish Oatmeal, Variety Pack of Regular, Apples & Cinnamon, and Maple & Brown Sugar, 10-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)",
    "McCann's Instant Irish Oatmeal, Variety Pack of Regular, Apples & Cinnamon, and Maple & Brown Sugar, 10-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)<br /><br />I'm a fan of the McCann's steel-cut oats, so I thought I'd give the instant variety a try. I found it to be a hardy meal, not too sweet, and great for folks like me (post-bariatric surgery) who need food that is palatable, easily digestible, with fiber but won't make you bloat.",
    "For those of us with celiac disease this product is a lifesaver and what could be better than getting it at almost half the price of the grocery or health food store!  I love McCann's instant oatmeal - all flavors!!!<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Abby",
    "What else do you need to know? Oatmeal, instant (make it with a half cup of low-fat milk and add raisins;nuke for 90 seconds). More expensive than Kroger store brand oatmeal and maybe a little tastier or better texture or something. It's still just oatmeal. Mmm, convenient!",
    "I WAS VISITING MY FRIEND NATE THE OTHER MORNING FOR COFFEE , HE CAME OUT OF HIS STORAGE ROOM WITH ( A PACKET OF McCANNS INSTANT IRISH OATMEAL .) HE SUGGESTED THAT I TRY IT FOR MY OWN USE ,IN MY STASH . SOMETIMES NATE DOSE NOT GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO SAY NO , SO I ENDED UP TRYING THE APPLE AND CINN . FOUND IT TO BE VERY TASTEFULL WHEN MADE WITH WATER OR POWDERED MILK . IT GOES GOOD WITH O.J. AND COFFEE AND A SLICE OF TOAST AND YOUR READY TO TAKE ON THE WORLD...OR THE DAY AT LEAST..

    "The variety packs taste great!<br /><br />I have them every morning. At $0.30 cents per meal, I don't understand why everyone on earth isn't buying this stuff up.<br /><br />Maple and brown sugar is terrific, followed by apples and cinnamon, followed by regular. You don't get tired of the same ole thing, and they taste great.<br /><br />I just boil water from a small pot, empty the packet or 2 in a bowl, pour in boiling water, and watch it expand to 2x its size!<br /><br />Taste really good and takes minutes to prepare.<br /><br />Not sure why everyone on earth isn't this. Convenient, healthy, very quick, excellent quality, and extremely cheap...",
    "McCann's makes oatmeal for every oatmeal connoisseur, whether one likes it from the raw pellet state that cooks for half an hour, to the sloth addled instant, which can be done in the microwave for under three minutes. It's all good, that's for sure, and the beauty of the instant variety is that it is available in different flavors as well as regular.<br />  This variety pack allows different tastes to be explored, as well as giving you a chance to experience the difference between McCann's and other well-known oatmeals. What I personally like about McCann's is that it cooks up thicker and with more body than the top brand here in America. The Apples & Cinnamon, though, tends to be a little liquidy so you may want to experiment with the amount of water you add. In my 1300watt microwave the oatmeal cooks up in about one minute and twenty-seven seconds, so you should also watch that to get a handle on how much time and water to use.<br />  The only bad thing -- if you can consider it a bad thing -- about this offering is that you have to buy in lot so you'll end up with six ten-count boxes. This is good if you have a whole family of oatmeal-eaters, but if you're a single person alone -- well, love oatmeal.",
    "I have McCann's Oatmeal every morning and by ordering it from Amazon I am able to save almost $3.00 per box.<br />It is a great product. Tastes great and very healthy",
    "McCann's Oatmeal is a good quality choice.  Our favorite is the Apples and Cinnamon, but we find that none of these are overly sugary.  For a good hot breakfast in 2 minutes, this is excellent.",
    "We really like the McCann's steel cut oats but find we don't cook it up too often.<br />This tastes much better to me than the grocery store brands and is just as convenient.<br />Anything that keeps me eating oatmeal regularly is a good thing.",
    "This seems a little more wholesome than some of the supermarket brands, but it is somewhat mushy and doesn't have quite as much flavor either.  It didn't pass muster with my kids, so I probably won't buy it again.",
    "Good oatmeal.  I like the apple cinnamon the best.  Though I wouldn't follow the directions on the package since it always comes out too soupy for my taste.  That could just be me since I like my oatmeal really thick to add some milk on top of.",
    "The flavors are good.  However, I do not see any differce between this and Oaker Oats brand - they are both mushy.",
    "I really like the Maple and Brown Sugar flavor. The regular is fine with brown sugar added. The Apples and Cinnamon flavor is OK. This is a very quick, easy and satisfying breakfast and I'll order this brand again, but not the variety. I'll get all Maple and Brown Sugar.",
    "This is the same stuff you can buy at the big box stores.  There is nothing healthy about it.  It is just carbs and sugars.  Save your money and get something that at least has some taste.",
    "This oatmeal is not good. Its mushy, soft, I don't like it. Quaker Oats is the way to go.",
    "Got a free package of these with a bottle of bloody mary mix I bought from the seller, and the advertising worked..lol,  I tried them, and shared them with 2 buddies, and we all loved them...  So im here to buy more, and noticed there were no reviews yet,...  well now there is.  They are Hot,  but not \"burn your mouth forever hot\"  its a nice temp...  Perfect for us..",
    "This wasn't in stock the last time I looked. I had to go to the Vermont Country Store in Weston to find it along with a jaw harp, Cranberry Horseradish Sauce, Fartless Black Bean Salsa, Apple Cider Jelly, Newton's Cradle Art in Motion and the staple Vermont Maple Syrup.<br /><br />Back to the Ass Kickin Peanuts. They are hot. They will activate the perspiration glands behind your ears and under your arms. It requires a beverage as advertised, a glass of very cold milk, and a box of Kleenex since it will make your nose run. They look like ordinary peanuts which is already giving me ideas for work. I suspect that some people have been hitting my goodies in my absence, especially my colleague Greg. I'm going to take this to work at earliest opportunity and empty the contents of this can into an ordinary Planters Peanuts can, and then see whose crying or whose nose is running when I return.<br /><br />The can should be shaken to ensure the spices are evenly distributed. It is important to wash your hands after consumption and not touch the eyes.<br /><br />You'll go nuts over these Ass-Kickin' Peanuts.<br /><br />P.S. I'm not sharing the peanuts, not deliberately, and I'll probably give Greg the jaw harp for Christmas. He'll be so insulted.",
    "we're used to spicy foods down here in south texas and these are not at all spicy.  doubt very much habanero is used at all.  could take it up a notch or two.",
    "I roast at home with a stove-top popcorn popper (but I do it outside, of course). These beans (Coffee Bean Direct Green Mexican Altura) seem to be well-suited for this method. The first and second cracks are distinct, and I've roasted the beans from medium to slightly dark with great results every time. The aroma is strong and persistent. The taste is smooth, velvety, yet lively.",
    "We roast these in a large cast iron pan on the grill (about 1/3 of the bag at a time).  The smell is wonderful and the roasted beans taste delicious too.  More importantly, the coffee is smooth; no bitter aftertaste.  On numerous occasions, we've had to send the roasted beans home with friends because they like it so much.",
    "Deal was awesome!  Arrived before Halloween as indicated and was enough to satisfy trick or treaters.  I love the quality of this product and it was much less expensive than the local store's candy.",
    "It is chocolate, what can I say.  Great variety of everything our family loves.  With a family of six it goes fast here.  Perfect variety.  Kit Kat, Reeses, take five and more.",
    "Great product, nice combination of chocolates and perfect size!  The bags had plenty, and they were shipped promptly.  The kids in the neighborhood liked our candies!",
    "Halloween is over but, I sent a bag to my daughters class for her share. The chocolate was fresh and enjoyed by many.",
    "Watch your prices with this.  While the assortment was good, and I did get this on a gold box purchase, the price for this was<br />$3-4 less at Target.",
    "This bag of candy online is pretty expensive, it should be cheaper in order to compete with grocery stores, other than that, its a good combination of my favorite candy",
    "Arrived in 6 days and were so stale i could not eat any of the 6 bags!!",
    "I have used the endurolyte product for several years in both pill and powder form.  Long desert rides on the dirt bike always found my camelbak water heavily laced with the endurolyte powder, not overly tasty, but quite effective, as I never got a cramp on these several hundred mile rides.  Same for desert racing in the buggy, the camelbaks were always laced with the powder.  Now we have the Fizz...what a great product!  Firstly, its Hammer's endurolyte product so it's great, endurance athlete's the world over use their products. Second its convenient, handly tablets that dissovle in a fizz.  Third it tastes great! Imagine getting a nice cool drink when your body is starving for hydration and electrolytes and rather than getting a \"salty\" taste, you get a refreshing lemon-lime or mango!  The camelbaks always get the Fizz now.  I also drop a tablet in my bottled water whenever I exercise and have a nice flavored water chock full of electrolytes. I cannot recommend this product or any hammer product highly enough.",
    "This product serves me well as a source of electrolytes during and after a long run or bike ride.<br />I have tried all of the flavors but really do like the grapefruit flavor... no after-taste and I actually like the slight carbonation.<br />I use other Hammer products and really like their whole product line.",
    "This stuff really works for preventing cramping during the middle to latter stages of your rides. Pop 1 into each water bottle and you're set. Flavor is fine and goes down easy.",
    "For those of us on a low carb diet these little tablets are just the thing.<br /><br />Two years ago I started cycling again after many years but was having heart arrhythmia after longer rides in high heat.  I was drinking plain water but did a little research and thought electrolytes might be the issue.  Gatorade wasn't an option because it is so loaded with carbohydrates so I looked around for a low-carb alternative.  The \"zero carb\" sports drinks didn't help so what to do?  One day I ran across these at my bike shop so tried a tube of them.....voila!...problem solved!!<br /><br />I've shared them with two friends in particular whose problems with leg cramps were resolved while using these.<br /><br />These guys got it right -- they are superbly formulated and simply work.....",
    "I purchased the Mango flavor, and to me it doesn't take like Mango at all.  There is no hint of sweetness, and unfortunately there is a hint or aftertaste almost like licorice.  I've been consuming various sports nutrition products for decades, so I'm familiar and have come to like the taste of the most of the products I've tried.  The mango flavor is one of the least appealing I've tasted.  It's not terrible, but it's bad enough that I notice the bad taste every sip I take.",
    "If you're impulsive like me, then $6 is ok. Don't get me wrong, the quality of these babies is very good and I have no complaints. But in retrospect, the price is a little ridiculous (esp. when you add on the shipping).",
    "this was sooooo deliscious but too bad i ate em too fast and gained 2 pds! my fault",
    "These Albanese gummi bears and rings and so on are very good and tasty and high quality. The bears even have little faces. At my local candy store this type of gummi stuff (bears, rings, snakes, balls, worms, whatever) are about $10/lb. These twin packs of 4.5 or 5 pound bags is a screaming deal as far as I'm concerned. I'm probably 50 pounds deep in these friggin' things. Consumed!",
    "Grape gummy bears are hard to find in my area. In fact pretty much anyone I talk to about grape gummy bears they think I'm lying. So I bought 10lbs... : ) These bears are a little bit bigger then the other brands and have kind of sour kick, but nothing to strong. I love grape flavored candy/soda and these are pretty good. There is another company that makes grape gummy bears that are a little bit better in my opinion, but these are well worth it for the price. I like to use the gummy bears in home made Popsicles with flavored sports drink. The salt in the sports drink makes for softer popsicles, and the gummy bears are awesome frozen. They are delicious!",
    "I ordered two of these and two of raspberry latice tarts directly from FantasiCakes website for a dinner party I was hosting. It arrived fresh and intact. Very good size. I froze half for later use. I am a pastry lover and these were the best I've ever tasted. The pastry was soft, the jam was really good and the taste was great. They were gone in no time. My guests were really impressed.",
    "Buyer Beware Please! This sweetener is not for everybody.  Maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body.  You will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience. Nausea, diarrhea & headaches can also be experienced. I learned my lesson the hard way years ago when I fell in love with the sugar-free chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell.  I thought I'd found sugar-free chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in.  The discomfort was unlike anything I had ever felt before.  I blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping.  As the symptoms passed, this too was very unpleasant.  Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit, all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate. My hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when I purchased some delicious sugar-free popcorn at my local market.  The taste was amazing and while I was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy, new sugarfree treat taste so good, my heart sank when I followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener* down to the very bottom of the label and read \"maltitol\" in tiny little letters! Thank goodness I'd eaten only a little. I still ended up with all the same side-effects but for a much shorter duration. Some people can use maltitol to their heart's content but others, like me, can have a bad reaction to it. In case you're like me, ... it's not you ...it's the maltitol!",
    "It is okay.  I would not go out of my way to buy it again",
    "No tea flavor at all. Just whole brunch of artifial flavors. It is not returnable. I wasted 20+ bucks.",
    "These looked like a perfect snack to through in with my trail mix.  Unfortunately, they arrived in a solid mass of melted chocolate.  I left them in my pantry for a few days, and when I opened them at room temperature they were still gooey.  I through them in the fridge and I've been breaking off hunks ever since.  They taste good to me, but the chocolate is all grainy after melting and then solidifying again.  I won't order them online again, but if I see them in a store I would pick them up.",
    "These taste really good. I have been purchasing a different brand and these are very similar in taste and texture. I agree with the other reviewer regarding ordering in the summer. There is no insulating packaging with ice packs so they will melt in warm weather like all chocolate food items. Order in cold weather and buy enough to last!!!",
    "The taste was great, but the berries had melted.  May order again in winter. If you order in cold weather you should enjoy flavor.",
    "i know i cannot make tea this good.  granted, i am not from the south but i know i have never enjoyed tea that was this sweet without being too sweet.  it tastes crisp.",
    "This peppermint stick is delicious and fun to eat.  My dad got me one for Christmas because he remembered me having a similar one when I was a little girl.  I'm 30 now and I love it!",
    "Great gift for all ages! I purchased these giant canes before and the recipients loved them so much, they kept them and would not eat them.",
    "I know the product title says Molecular Gastronomy, but don't let that scare you off.  I have been looking for this for a while now, not for food science, but for something more down to earth.  I use it to make my own coffee creamer.<br /><br />I have to have my coffee blonde and sweet - but the flavored creamers are full of the bad kinds of fat, and honestly, I hate to use manufactured \"food\" items.  I really don't think they are good for the body.  On the other hand, I hate using cold milk or cream, because I like HOT coffee.<br /><br />I stumbled across this on Amazon one day and got the idea of making my own creamer.  I also bought low-fat (non-instant) milk powder and regular milk powder. The non-instant lowfat milk is a little sweeter and tastes fresher than regular instant low-fat milk, but does not dissolve good in cold water - which is not a problem for hot coffee.  You will have to play with the ratios - I would not do just the heavy cream, it made the coffee too rich. Also, I think the powder is too expensive to just use on it's own. I like mixing 1/3 of each together.<br /><br />For flavoring, I bough cocoa bean powder, vanilla bean powder, and caster (superfine) sugar.  I mix up small batches along with spices like cinnamon and nutmeg to make my own flavored creamers.  If you wanted, you could use a fake sweetner powder instead.  I make up small amounts that I store in jelly canning jars. I also use my little food chopper/food processor to blend everything, so the sugar is not heavier and sinks to the bottom.  Let it settle for a bit before opening the top though.<br /><br />This stuff tastes WAY better than the storebought creamers and it is fun to experiment and come up with your own flavors.  I am going to try using some essential oils next and see if I can get a good chocolate/orange mix.<br /><br />All of the ingredients I mentioned are here online.  Take the time to experiment.  Maybe you don't use any low-fat milk. Or don't add any flavorings.  It is up to you.  Also, would make great housewarming/host(ess) gifts.<br /><br />I am sure other molecular people will be able to tell you more of what you can do with it, and I am sure I will experiment with it in cooking - but the main reason I bought it was to make my own creamer and it worked out great.",
    "While my dogs like all of the flavors that we have tried of this dog food, for some reason their itching increased when I tried the lamb and rice. I have some very itchy dogs and am giving them a limited ingredient dog food to try to help. The duck and sweet potato cut down on the itching significantly, but when we tried lamb and rice they started itching more once again. I like Natural Balance for the quality ingredients.",
    "Awesome dog food. However, when given to my \"Boston\", who has severe reactions to some food ingredients; his itching increased to violent jumping out of bed at night, scratching. As soon as I changed to a different formula, the scratching stopped. So glad Natural Balance has other choices. I guess you have to try each, until you find what's best for your pet.",
    "We have three dogs and all of them love this food!  We bought it specifically for one of our dogs who has food allergies and it works great for him, no more hot spots or tummy problems.<br />I LOVE that it ships right to our door with free shipping.",
    "My dog has a ton of allergies both environmental and food. She was on a prescription dog food before we had her tested to see what allergies she has. After we got the test back, we learned she was allergic to something in the prescription brand. So I finally found this dog food and she has done so well on this! She still has her environmental triggers, but I am happy she can finally eat something I know won't cause her pain.",
    "My shepherd/collie mix has IBS.  Our vet recommended a limited ingredient food.  This has really helped her symptoms and she likes it.  I will always buy it from Amazon...it's $10 cheaper and free shipping!",
    "Natural Balance Dry Dog Food Lamb Meal and Brown Rice Recipe did wonders for my Jack Russell. She has awful food allergy's and this food was our last hope because it was the last food we could find that didn't have SOMETHING in it that she was allergic to. She has no problem eating it dry but normally I mix the Natural Balance Dry Lamb and Brown Rice with the Natural Balance Wet Lamb and Brown Rice.. she seems to like that better. We started feeding it to our other dog (a Bichon) too and she loves it. If your dog has allergy's or stomach issue.. or if you want your dog to eat better food-- this is it! You will see a difference in your pet.",
    "Great food! I love the idea of one food for all ages & breeds. Ît's a real convenience as well as a really good product.  My 3 dogs eat less, have almost no gas, their poop is regular and a perfect consistency, what else can a mom ask for!!",
    "I have a standard poodle and pomeranian who both do wonderful on this food. I have switched them to a different food (due to price) a couple of times and end up going right back to natural balance.",
    "This is great dog food, my dog has severs allergies and this brand is the only one that we can feed him.",
    "This food is great - all ages dogs.  I have a 3 year old and a puppy.  They are both so soft and hardly ever get sick.  The food is good especially when you have Amazon Prime shipping  :)",
    "My golden retriever is one of the most picky dogs I've ever met.  After experimenting with various types of food, I have found she loves natural balance.  What I really like about natural balance is the fact that it has multiple flavors in dry and wet varieties.  I mix her dry food with a little wet food and my golden loves it.  Furthermore, I do like mixing up the flavors each time as I think the same meal day over day might get a little boring, so I figured why not.  I tend to stay away from the fish type though as it smells...<br /><br />Additionally, I started purchasing off Amazon because Petco didn't have the wet food box and only had a couple of cans.  I came home and to my surprise realized that I could save $20 each time I bought dog food if I just buy it off Amazon.<br /><br />All in all, I definitely recommend and give my stamp of approval to natural balance dog food.  While I have never eaten it, my dog seems to love it.",
    "This is the same food we get at pet store. But it's delivered to my door! And for the same price or slightly less.",
    "I've been very pleased with the Natural Balance dog food. Our dogs have had issues with other dog foods in the past and I had someone recommend Natural Balance grain free since it is possible they were allergic to grains. Since switching I haven't had any issues. It is also helpful that have have different kibble size for larger/smaller sized dogs.",
    "My 1-1/2 year old basenji/jack russell mix loves this dog food. He's been noticeably healthier and more energetic since I switched him over from the standard dog foods earlier this year. Despite the higher cost of natural dog foods, I find that he eats significantly less of the Natural Balance dog foods and still stays happy and full. On the normal dog foods, he'd eat up to 3 cups of dog food a day (the recommended serving for his size), whereas he only eats about 1 cup to 1-1/2 cup of the Natural Balance dog food a day. When you take this into account, you're actually getting more \"bang for your buck\" with the natural dog foods since you don't have to buy as much to last just as long as the normal dog foods... and a healthier, happier dog, to boot! Add in the fact that you can get free, 2-day shipping with Amazon Prime... I'm sold!!",
    "Our pup has experienced allergies in forms of hotspots and itching from other dog foods. The cheap 'you can buy it anywhere' food not only have crazy preservatives in them but can cause health problems for your pets.  This food works wonders on reducing allergies and our dog loves the food.<br />This message is RAMSEY FrAnkenSteiN approved.",
    "My English Bulldog had skin allergies the summer we got him at age 3.  The vet recommended we wean him off the food his previous owner gave him (Iams Lamb and Rice) and onto a new kind.  This was the second one we tried, and it has been working ever since.  It's for dogs that need a limited diet who can be sensitive to additives and proteins commonly found in commercial dog food (like chicken or beef).",
    "I fed this to my Golden Retriever and he hated it.  He wouldn't eat it, and when he did, it gave him terrible diarrhea.  We will not be buying this again.  It's also super expensive.",
    "The mouth says, \"How do I love thee, let me count the ways...\"<br />If you like apple products a must have item.  The only draw back, shipping cost.  These are very heavy.",
    "Arrived slightly thawed. My parents wouldn't accept it. However, the company was very helpful and issued a full refund.",
    "The crust on these tarts are perfect.  My husband loves these, but I'm not so crazy about them.  They are just too sour/tart for my taste.  I'll eat the crust and hubby takes my filling.  My kids think they're great, so maybe it's just me.",
    "These are absolutely scrumptuous!  My husband and I both love them, however, as another customer put it, they are expensive to ship!  The cost of shipping is more than the tartlets themselves are!",
    "What a nice alternative to an apple pie. Love the fact there was no slicing and dicing. Easy to prepare. I also loved the fact that you can make them fresh whenever needed.",
    "I like Creme Brulee. I loved that these were so easy. Just sprinkle on the sugar that came with and broil. They look amazing and taste great. My guess thought I really went out of the way for them when really it took all of 5 minutes. I will be ordering more!",
    "not what I was expecting in terms of the company's reputation for excellent home delivery products",
    "I first bought pickled asparagus at an Amish market and it was love at first bite. Hence, when I saw these on the discount rack at the local Safeway I cleaned it out.  These are even better than the ones from the Amish market. They are fantastic, and some of the jars have a bonus clove of garlic at the bottom. I'm going to order the six pack and I'm a household of one. They wont go to waste!",
    "I love asparagus.  Up until very recently, I had never had pickled asparagus.  Oh my goodness, when a friend introduced me to this exact brand, I couldn't believe how great stuff tasted.  I loved it so much I bought the six pack.  I've got 2 jars left.  Gonna need more!!",
    "I'm presently on a diet and I was at my Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Grocery looking over possible diet foods. I wanted things that were tasty, non-fat and low in calories. I came home with about a dozen items. That's how I discovered the Tillen Farms Pickled Crispy Asparagus. Well, I've always liked asparagus anyway and I've enjoyed several brands of pickled asparagus. This Tillen Farms brand is really, really good! It's the best I can recall. There's an excellent flavor and a big clove of garlic down in  the bottom of the jar which I'm looking forward to eating. I can't believe how good this asparagus tastes and right on the front it says \"only 60 calories per jar!\" Now this is my idea of a good diet food!<br /><br />Gary Peterson",
    "I was diappointed in the flavor and texture of this mix.  I usually like most of the Low Carb things I have tried, but was diappointed in this specific one.",
    "I have been drinking this tea for a long time now.  I used to have to purchase it at a doctor's office because it wasn't available elsewhere.  I'm so glad that I can buy it now from Amazon.com.  I drink this tea throughout the day like other folks drink coffee.  Wonderful taste.",
    "I have been drinking Royal King 100% Natural Organic Green Tea (100 tea bags x 2g each) as my every day tea for several years now.  I buy 12 boxes at a time to save on shipping.  For many years I used to drink coffee from morning till night.  But finally I realized that drinking so much coffee was not healthy for me.  I finally resolved to improve my health and stopped drinking coffee all together.  I tried many alternative drinks to replace my coffee habit.  I found that green tea was not only good tasting it also has health benefits.  Green tea is one of the few drinks that actually makes you healthier (coffe and other drinks do not) - the only healthier drink is quality cold water.  In my opinion, for the price, Royal King 100% Natural Organic Green Tea is one of the best tasting teas.  This green tea has a beautiful golden color, the taste is bright and fresh.  I recommend adding a tiny amount of Y.S. Organic Bee Farms RAW HONEY to the tea to add sweetness and health benefits too.  I also give myself a treat once in a while by having a much more expense tea (Tribute Xi Hu Long Jing) but this fantastic tea is not practical for me to drink as my every day tea (although I would if I could afford it).<br /><br />Cons:  On my latest shipment the package shown on the Amazon page is different than the one shipped.  The one shipped displays \"NATURALLY HIGH IN POLYPHENOL CATECHINS\" (a key contributive element to the possible health effects of tea), whereas the Amazon package displays \"CAFFENE FREE\".  So I am not sure if this green tea is Caffene free or not.  The other con is that sometimes the tea bag rips open when I unwrap the string from around the tea bag. So if the string seems stuck to the tea bag I put the bag in the hot water to unstick it.",
    "this has to be one of the best teas I have ever tasted... it's clean, bright, fresh...<br /><br />great delivery...again quality... just try it...",
    "I love, love this green tea.  It is very hard to find in our area and some places on the internet charge a big price and I usually don't get as many boxes as I did with this merchant.  I will definitely order from this seller again!! Thanks!!  I depend on my green tea fix everyday!",
    "I love this tea. It helps curb my eating during the day. My Mom and I have given it all friends to try.",
    "I'm Italian and I lived in Italy for years. I used to buy these cookies for my everyday breakfast with an Italian espresso. I couldn't find them anywhere here in the Bay area, so it's great to have them again.",
    "In the 1980s I spent several summers in Italy. This biscotti is often given as a breakfast food or mid-day snack. They are simple and delicious and were not sold in the US back then. They are so good that I brought back two bags from a recent trip to Italy. It is great to see that they may now be found on Amazon!<br /><br />Note: it is great to open a bag, smell the contents, pour a glass of milk, then dip the Macines in the milk. Great routine and treat for kids!",
    "I had heard a little about this product from the local pet store, then tried a small bag for our 2 cats of about 3 and 6 years respectively. The female, younger one took to it right away, and the older male, who was unfortunately weaned on the junk cat food with all the corn meal and etc... in it, and would usually refuse a diet change, actually liked it too. The older male is overweight and we were trying to switch him to soft food on the doctor's request, but he totally refused it. He is a posh cat after all. He still consumes too many calories, the fatty, but at least I know he's eating good food. Of course, I know this product seems to cost more than most other feline food on the market, but I just can't see feeding our animals the lousy alternatives that are out there, marketed as being healthy. Why do commercials show cats eating a vegetarian diet which is mostly corn meal? Is that right? I'll stay with this for now, but stay tuned.<br /><br />I'm updating this review after 9 months of using this cat food for our two cats. I upgraded the stars from 4 to 5 as it really has been a good food for the two of them. Garfield still eats a little too much, but he's just a big cat who doesn't exercise much, let's face it. Our female cat will be 4 years old in a couple months and she's so healthy. She's tiny, but happy and agile. I tried the chicken version of Holistic Select, but Garfield seemd to miss this sardine version so we went back to this one. I've ordered the duck version and will update this once they try it.",
    "I started buying this after I noticed my 1 year old cat was already starting to lose his \"spunk\" so I decided it was time to start buying him \"real\" cat food...not the garbage in the super markets. I found this at the pet store out of the other million choices, and I'm sure there are other brands that are just as good but this is the one I went with to try first and it was a great purchase. My cat has been on this for the past 8 months and he's now just has active as he was when he was a kitten and his coat has became sooo soft. Mainly, he loved the taste even more! I highly recommend this brand to all my friends and family for their animals!",
    "I have done a lot of research to find the best food for my cat, and this is an excellent food.  That is also according to my holistic veterinarian.  They put probiotics on the kibble as the last step, which is very important to me.  The best thing is that my cat loved it immediately and I had to stop mixing it with the old food because she only would eat Holistic Select.",
    "This cat food was recommended by my vet because my 13 year old Cleo Cat was having trouble keeping any food down and was loosing weight.  It stopped her problems.  She doesn't eat as much as before since she seems to be more satisfied after eating which helps justify the added price.  It aids in digestion since the...ok sorry...smells are gone if ya know what I mean.  Had to add that so anyone experiencing problems with their cats can see there are a lot of benifits from this cat food.",
    "I have a 4 year old male cat who has chronic urinary tract infections.  I feed him this dry food in combination with wet food (with water added to it) and Uri Ease.  The combination seems to keeps his UTI's under control.  If I switch to another type of dry food, his UTI gets worse.  The other cats seem to enjoy this food as well.  It's expensive but it seems to be the best solution for me.",
    "Before I was educated about feline nutrition, I allowed my cats to become addicted to dry cat food. I always offered both canned and dry, but wish I would have fed them premium quality canned food and limited dry food. I have two 15 year old cats and two 5 year old cats. The only good quality dry foods they will eat are Wellness and Innova. Innova's manufacturer was recently purchased by Procter&Gamble. I began looking for a replacement. After once again offering several samples (from my local holistic pet store) Holistic Select was the only one (other than the usual Wellness and Innova) they would eat. For finicky cats, I recommend trying Holistic Select. It is a good quality food that is very palatable for finicky eaters.",
    "My holistic vet recommended this, along with a few other brands. We tried them all, but my cats prefer this (especially the sardine version). The best part is their coats are so soft and clean and their eyes are so clear. AND (and I don't want to be rude, so I'll say this as delicately as I can) their waste is far less odorous than cats who eat the McDonalds junk found in most stores, which is a definite plus for me! The health benefits are so obvious - I highly recommend Holistic Select!",
    "One of my cats is allergic to fish and beef. This formula is one of the few she can eat, and it has much better ingredients than the prescription diets available at the vet. Both of my kitties are very active, have soft shiny fur, and neither are fat. Dry food reduces tartar buildup on teeth, also.",
    "Our cats thrive extremely well on this dry cat food.  They definitely have much less hair ball throw ups and their fur is great.  They are fit and not over weight.  This vendor ships extremely fast.  Is one of the top Amazon suppliers in our book!",
    "I've been a fan of Hot & Spicy Maruchan Ramen for a long time. If you enjoy spice, and love ramen, you'll love this product. Too bad it's way too expensive here on Amazon. It's only $3.36 per 12 at my Walmart.",
    "I've been eating Ramen noodles since I was a little kid, and I've never found a better flavor than Hot & Spicy Chicken!  It isn't hot at all to a chilihead like me, but it sure is good!",
    "I LOVE spicy ramen, but for whatever reasons this thing burns my stomach badly and the burning sensation doesn't go away for like 3 hours! Not sure if that is healthy or not .... and you can buy this at Walmart for $0.28, way cheaper than Amazon.",
    "Always being a fan of ramen as a quick and easy meal, finding it on amazon for a decent price and having it delivered to your door by the case is an amazing situation for anyone to find themselves in.",
    "I must be a bit of a wuss, because this soup tastes to me how I imagine fire might taste. Typically I like spicy food if it has a good flavor.  I don't find this to be the case with this soup. Any flavor is killed off by the burn.",
    "I really loved the spicy flavor these had.  I found myself liking the broth more than the noodles which is usually the opposite.  If you aren't used to the heat this might bother you and if you like hot hot foods this might not be enough.",
    "Got these on sale for roughly 25 cents per cup, which is half the price of my local grocery stores, plus they rarely stock the spicy flavors. These things are a GREAT snack for my office where time is constantly crunched and sometimes you can't escape for a real meal. This is one of my favorite flavors of Instant Lunch and will be back to buy every time it goes on sale.",
    "i have bought allot of different flavors and this happens to be one of my favorites and will be getting more soon",
    "I love this flavor of ramen! I don't eat other flavors anymore because they taste too bland by comparison. For the convenience of having it delivered to my home (I have prime, so I get it in two days and don't have to pay for the shipping), the price on amazon isn't bad at all, but it is still cheaper to run down and pick up a case of this at the grocery store.",
    "The BEST investment I've ever made for ginger. It's unbelievable! It's fibrous like the real ginger, has that spicy kick to it, but it's perfect with the sugar - calms it down.  It's very worth the $40 for 5lbs of it!  I'll be getting more soon - I use these as a topper for my ginger cupcakes and cookies :)",
    "Delicious. I cannot get Australian ginger where I live. This compares favorably to Australian Ginger I've purchased in other cities. Now I can enjoy it without traveling.",
    "I keep trying other brands.... cheaper brands. Stupid me! This ginger IS soooo worth the money. Tender, moist and never a let down.",
    "My son has had acid reflux since birth and has been on every medication available with no improvement, Until an older gentleman came into his work place and told him about this product and I automatically ordered it for him. I was really not expecting any better results than the 1000 other things we have tried. What a surprise! He has not had any heartburn or symptoms since day 2 of starting eating one piece of this Ginger each morning. He can now eat anything and actually enjoy it. This product was a God send for him. Thank you all for it!",
    "I bought this for our office to give people something sweet to snack on.  Because it's bite size it's easier for people to grab a couple a pieces rather than an entire licorice stick. My only complaint is that one of the bags broke open in shipping.",
    "Twizzlers brand licorice is much better than that other well known brand.<br />If you can get these for $2 to $2.50 a package with free s/h it's a good deal.<br />The black and cherry have good taste; but the strawberry taste was too delicate and barely there",
    "I love these.........very tasty!!!!!!!!!!!  Infact, I think I am addicted to them.<br />Buying them in packs of 6 bags - is very reasonable than going to Target and getting a bag.  Savings are about a $1.00 a bag.  I use subscribe and save on these and several other product.  I love subscribe and save!!!!!!!!!!!",
    "If you are looking for a less messy version of licorice for the children, then be sure to try these!  They're soft, easy to chew, and they don't get your hands all sticky and gross in the car, in the summer, at the beach, etc. We love all the flavos and sometimes mix these in with the chocolate to have a very nice snack! Great item, great price too, highly recommend!",
    "I might be mistaken, but it appears that the pieces in this bag were reduced in size.  If they did do that, it was doubtlessly done to make it appear that the buyer got a better deal, having so many pieces after all.  The problem is that the pieces have to be a certain size in order to have enough flavor for your eating experience.  As it is, you have to use 2 or 3 pieces to match the old piece size;  it is not the same.",
    "Being a fan of Newman's Pineapple salsa for quite a while, I was looking for a comparable salsa.  This is one of the best tasting salsas I've ever had.  My daughters love it too.  They don't like super chunky salsa and the Berry Mango has a nice smooth texture with small mango pieces.  The salsa is not too sweet, just sweet enough and although it's mild, it has a nice little kick to it.  At this price, it's a steal!",
    "The SALSA smelled delicious, as I think it probably was - but, unfortunately, the person, at AMAZON, that is a packer (there is probably several) had very little \"stuffing\" to work with, especially on the bottoms.  Therefore, the bottoms were broken on all three bottles. As I reached for my computer; I was told NO RETURNS (cause it's a food item).  I then looked for a CUSTOMER SERVICE tag; and I found \"none\" on their NEW FACE LIFT.  THEY SEEM TO BE PROUD OF THEIR NEW FACE LIFT BUT...THEY SHOULD AT LEAST HAVE A PLACE TO CONTACT THEM IN EMERGENCIES!  LIKE: I BUY A LOT OF \"STUFF\" AND IT ALL COMES IN STYROFOAM BOXES.  NEVER WOULD I SHIP THINGS<br />ESPECIALLY SALSA - IN A CARDBOARD BOX WITH JUST A STRIPE OF LARGE BUBBLE WRAP ON IT.  NO MATTER HOW MUCH THE CARRIER (FED EX) IS CAREFUL, IT'S GOING TO BREAK SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE.  ESPECIALLY IN AN ALL GLASS CONTAINER!  BARBARA L. S.",
    "This is one of the best salsas that I have found in a long time but stay away from the variety pack. The other two that come with it are not worth your money.",
    "These remind me of dog treats I made once using pumpkin and cinnamon. They're kind of bland and not my favorite Back To Nature product. But my finace really loves them so that's where the three stars come from.",
    "This is the best cornmeal. I made regular cornbread and hot water cornbread with this meal and both were outstanding. Also fried some oysters with this meal, it gave them a great texture and flovor.",
    "This is a fabulous marinade!  I love to use it for chicken, either baked in the oven OR on the grill.  This has enough flavor & flair, I've even used it for dinner parties, only to receive rave reviews from my guests!! DEFINITELY worth the price! Super cheap and super easy! Love it!",
    "Works with chicken fish beef or pork. Fast easy and makes it taste excellent. Plus buying in bulk is more than 50% off from box stores",
    "Got this for my brother who is on Jorge Cruise diet and decided to try one for myself.  It actually tastes pretty good.",
    "These singles sell for $2.50 - $3.36 at the store for 1 box of 24 singles. I'm not sure why Amazon is selling it for $9.99 for a box of 24 singles.  Hazelnut coffee creamer is my favorite, but truly this is not a good buy.",
    "AWESOME!!! such a yummy flavor I got it as a healthy alternative to the desserts we normally eat and I am so glad that I did there are so many things you can do with Jello desserts and still have them taste good and be good for you. I will definitentally be purchasing this product again the flavor was so wonderful.",
    "I went to 4 grocery stores looking for this flavor of Jello for my green tomato jam recipe and finally found it here. This jello is wonderful! Evidently it's only carried in the stores during the summer but with harvest time in the Fall, I couldn't find it anywhere in town. This Jello tastes like watermelon and the jam recipe I made with it takes like watermelon jam! Great made as regular Jello too. Yummy!",
    "What a deal this is the healthiest salt you can use.  This box should last our family the year no problem.  Iodized sea salt will not raise your blood pressure as regular salt will.",
    "Perfect size sea salt for the table or the picnic basket.  We love it. Shakes well, no clumping and flows freely.",
    "<span class=\"tiny\"> Length:: 0:26 Mins<br /><br /></span>The expiration date is 21 months from the day I bought this product. The tuna, tomato combination is delicious. This is one of the many items I re-order on Amazon every month or so.<br />edit: added a short video, so you see what this combination looks like.<br /><br />I was wearing one of those headlamps, but I didn't do a good job focusing on the tuna.<br />I should film it over, but it doesn't look like many people view this product anyway.",
    "I've never heard of the SAFCOL brand before but I was tired of only trying the typical pouches; Starkist and Chicken of the Sea. I was really surprised as I thought it was a bit better than the other brands and with less seasoning.",
    "these are the best tasting tuna pack they make in my opinion - make a great on the go snack, and really satisfying with the tomato",
    "I have always purchased Star-Kist tuna but thought I would try this brand for a change of pace. The taste of the tuna was not pleasant, too much basil and other spices for me.",
    "I'm not familiar with the Safcol brand but being a tuna addict, gave this a shot. The tuna tastes like it's good quality but I found the tomato basil flavor to be a bit bland. It's better than something plain but it didn't pack the punch I was hoping for. It's still a great option for a low calorie, low fat meal.",
    "I found it much tastier than the plain tuna pouches out there. Excellent quality, and no need to 'dress it up'.<br /><br />I put it the micro on about 20% power for 1 minute and Shazam!<br /><br />I believe a little heating brings out the flavor.",
    "Seriously this product was as tasteless as they come. There are much better tasting products out there but at 100 calories its better than a special k bar or cookie snack pack. You just have to season it or combine it with something else to share the flavor.",
    "I read about pomegranate molasses so I had to try it! I haven't made anything with it yet, just eaten a little bit at a time but WOW is it decadent! It's dark, syrupy, sour, and a little sweet. A dab of this and I forget about dessert. It's just a really unique flavor with a pleasing metallic undertone. Yum!! I'm going to try making fesenjan next :-)",
    "Used this in Moroccan recipes, as a syrup in a brilliant mixed beverage and as a swirled topping on sliced oranges soaked in orange water.  Wonderful, wonderful stuff!",
    "I don't know how long these sat on the back of a shelf somewhere, but they were so old that they wouldn't cook.  I had to throw half of them out, because the skins were damaged, a clear sign of dried beans past their prime.  I can't even return these or ask for a refund, because food is not returnable.  Will find a different brand to use.  For now, I have about fifty servings of beans to throw away.",
    "Besides being smaller than runts, they look the same and have the same consistency.  Unfortunately, they taste nothing like banana runts...nor do they even taste good.  Yucky stuff.  Trying to return with vendor.",
    "The item over all was fine, but the Banana Heads are not just like Banana Runts they are alot smaller. Also when I received the item, the packaging was not great. The Banana Heads had come open during shipping and were all over the packing envelope.",
    "I purchased as a giveaway for a baby shower with Jungle theme! They worked out perfect for 25 small bags of candy. I purchased 5#. If you want more than 25 small bags, I would purchase a larger bag.",
    "I have drunk Ricore since my mother allowed be to drink caffeine. I love this stuff in milk.<br />It's much smoother and tastier than instant coffee with milk. I am French and live in the US,<br />and bring back boxes of Ricore at every opportunity. Savora is another hidden gem you can bring<br />back. Check it out.",
    "I first had this drink when my mother brought it back with her from a visit to her home in Brittany France and thought it was delicious!  I wish it were a bit cheaper but other than that, I love this product!",
    "I couldn't wait to try the 8&#8243; Cinnamon Coffee Cake because it is made with fresh eggs, creamy sour cream, Madagascar Bourbon Vanilla and is topped and filled with cinnamon streusel. This 8&#8243; Cinnamon Coffee Cake is available online for only $18.95. Now, I have had my fair share of cinnamon coffee cakes, but, let me just tell you that the FantasiCakes Cinnamon Coffee Cake really \"takes the cake\" with size, price, quality and taste.<br />The cake arrived very fast and was carefully packaged so that it arrived in almost perfect condition. It also comes with a large tub of white icing that you can drizzle over the top, before serving. I couldn't believe how large the size was and it actually fed my family of 5 for us to enjoy during breakfast, for three days. The cake itself is thick and almost has a solid but sponge cake type consistency that is really moist and very filling. The flavors are to die for with the sticky cinnamon outside and sweet cinnamon and vanilla swirled throughout the inside of the cake. The icing really tops it off beautifully and gives it that moist and sticky sweet flavor. Pair the cake with your morning coffee and you've got the perfect breakfast treat!",
    "I used to love these growing up and stopped drinking water and lemon juice from this brand about 5-6 years ago. This stuff used to be so strong i used to just pour some in my mouth and get that alive feeling going. It feels like the product went through changes which added more water or something to make it not so strong. The stronger it is the less you use as well. The product is still really good but the taste is the same quality as the cheaper brand names almost. I thought  these would go fast but hey all lemon stuff i love unless it goes bad. This is a good product just wish it still had that hit me in the mouth chug sensation it used to be like.",
    "One of the best lemon juice that I have tried. I am recurring customer due to the high quality of this product. When the season for fresh lemos is out, this one supplement our need for the citrus on the kitchen or refreshments.<br /><br />I will continue buying it.",
    "This lemon juice is a must in my kitchen year-round. It has a powerful flavor and you don't need much of it to zest up a dish. I add a spritz of it to my water nearly every day.<br /><br />I will buy this product again and again.",
    "Fast delivery and good product. This is the same lemon juice concentrate you can find in stores and it's really handy to have around to add to sauces, dressings, etc. Such a pain to squeeze fresh juice everytime you need it, nevermind having the lemons on hand to begin with.",
    "This is not as good as the Frozen Lemon juice, but it is good. It has a slightly odd flavor, perhaps from a preservative. Sure wish I could order the frozen juice!",
    "Couldn't believe it when told how relaxing this beverage was. Seriously, drink it only if you are getting ready for a nap or bedtime. If you have plans to drive or perform any other activity not recommended.<br /><br />I feel my arms and legs almost tingle with relaxation. After a short time my eyes start to get droopy and I am in another place.<br /><br />Love this stuff.",
    "I bought these at Grocery Outlet here in the Seattle Tacoma are for $4.00 a case of tweleve not paying $38.00 Yes 3 for a dollar. I like the taste not great but not bad either low calorie will buy more but not at this whacked out price.",
    "This is an great product. The taste is great, and it works exactly as described. Superb natural sleep aid. AMAZING!",
    "WE have been looking for \"natural\" ways to help us sleep since we always seem to be overloaded with stress and a busy schedule. Yes, we'd probably be better served taking a yoga class, but this is a good second choice. This helps you fall asleep and stay asleep. I drank half the first night and that was plenty for me. After about 30 minutes, I was ready for bed! I woke up refreshed and with no sleepy-drug hangover, so that is a huge bonus.<br /><br />I gave the product 3 stars (instead of the 5 it deserves) as their packing job was marginal at best. The product arrived with 2 broken bottles, which at this price is a $6 loss! The bottles are glass and all they did was wrap one layer of the small-bubbled bubble wrap around the case and placed it in a larger box with extra room to move around in that box. Big packing fail, but the product is awesome.",
    "We made chocolate chip cookies with BRM Garbanzo Bean Flour and the results were fantastic!  The brown sugar and chocolate mask any bean taste that other reviews have mentioned.  Our friends couldn't discern any difference from classic CCCs.  The texture, body, and elasticity (meaning reduced tendency to fall apart that occurs with most other gluten-free flours) is nice and chewy -- the same as CCCs made with regular flour.  And an added bonus -- the high protein and fiber level (I calculate 2-3 g fiber/cookie) fills you up so that you are satisfied with smaller servings and the glycemic index is significantly lower.<br /><br />I highly recommend this flour even if CCCs are the only thing you make with it.",
    "This  is great stuff.  Made some really tasty banana bread.  Good quality and lowest price in town.",
    "We had trouble finding this locally - delivery was fast, no more hunting up and down the flour aisle at our local grocery stores.",
    "This packet of glaze is the secret to making those European style fresh fruit tarts. I am about to make one for a pie auction at church, after a friend requested that something \"strawberry\" should be offered. You can make the most amazing and relatively \"healthy\" fruit tarts by baking a base, layering it with uncooked, fresh, sliced fruit, then pouring over the made-up contents of one of these packets. They harden up at room temperature, hold the fruit together so you can slice the tart, and they let the beauty of the arranged fruit show through. I've also seen this glaze used over cheesecakes, to hold a fruit topping in place. Personally, I do not like cheesecake (too rich for me) but a fruit glazed cheesecake is gorgeous, I will admit. To do this, slice fruit and layer it on the cheesecake while it's still in the springform pan. Pour on the glaze, let it set up and then remove the springform. You'll have a clear layer of fruit on top of the cheesecake. Cherries, strawberries or sliced mangos are nice, but the best one I ever had used thin slices of lemons, that had been gently poached in sugar syrup before they were layered on the cake.<br /><br />I use a base of sponge cake, baked in a shallow form, but other bases can be pate sucre  (a kind of French pastry that is a bit like a sugar cookie) that works well in those fluted, straight-sided forms. You can also make mini-tarts in a muffin pan, pre-baking each mold with a layer of pie crust (even commercial crust works, though again, I prefer pate sucre, it holds its shape better and is more substantial and has a better crumb.) Just blind-bake the muffin tins lined with pate, then pop them out and fill with fresh fruits (berries are great) and pour over the glaze. Some people put a layer of creme patisserie, which is a pastry cream like custard but stabilized with flour,  below the fruit and I happen to think these taste best.<br /><br />If you get into baking, this glaze is a must-have on the shelf. The ingredients are vegan: tapioca starch, carrageenan, dextrose, cream of tartar, locust bean gum, so if you are looking to make a vegan tofu cheesecake, you can use this on top, as well as use it for fruit tarts with a nut crust base.",

    "I bought this coffee because its much cheaper than the ganocafe and has the organic reishi mushroom as well as other healthy antioxidants.  I didn't expect it to taste good, but it actually does!  I've only had it for a few days and for $5 its totally worth it.  My sisters all take ganocafe but now I'm introducing them to this less expensive similar coffee.  I will follow up on this product in a few weeks.  :)",
    "The coffee is very finely processed and the flavor is just alright.  Nescafe and Mount Hagen are better - I bought this to try something other than these two, but I probably won't get this again.  There is just a slight \"vitaminy\" taste, but it's not overwhelming.  It's also a bit pricey for what you get.",
    "This coffee is great because it's all organic ingredients!  No pesticides to worry about, plus it tastes good, and you have the healing effects for ganoderma.",
    "Like the other people mentioned, this coffee has a great taste. I've tried different instant coffees before, but this one is one of the better ones. Another one of my favorites, if you want to try it out (though NOT organic), is 'Africafe pure instant coffee'",
    "Tastes great, and gives me energy without the jitters. Love this product.<br />However, I do wish it came in some sort of resealable jar or hard plastic container instead of a zip-lock pouch because the zip-lock ripped off and quit working after awhile. But the product is fantastic, just not crazy about the packaging.",
    "These little guys are tasty and refreshing.<br /><br />I usually eat salads for lunch which can do terrible things to breath.  I eat 2 of these after lunch (because they are so small) and I find this sufficiently resolves the problem.<br /><br />They're sugar free (sugar can actually help the smelly bacteria grow) which is great and they're tasty enough that I almost think of them as part of my lunch.<br /><br />This is a good bulk value buy and I'd highly recommend the mints themselves.  Cheers!",

    "These little tins of sugar free mine mints were a great deal.There perfict for on the go.Fifty mints per tin is just the right amount to cary along.And there safer for your teeth than the ones with sugar.The price of twelve dollars was very resonable.Also there great for shareing.If you are looking for a mint try these ones.Youll be glad you did.",
    "Pros:<br />+packaging, shipping, price<br />+sold about a year before its expiration date (enough for me to eat/share 9 boxes)<br />+not too \"fresh\" like the regular wintergreen and not in a powdery form. it's a real mint!<br /><br />Cons: none!",
    "Be careful not to eat too many of them in one day, as one of the chemicals in it is the same as that of a LAXATIVE!!! LOLOLOL!!!",
    "These mints are really strong and have a great taste. They are also a convenient size to carry in a pocket or purse.",
    "This is a huge supply of them. I'm still working on these and have plenty to spare. Much more effective than buying one from the grocery store or 7-11 every time you want a mint.",
    "Even with small containers, they don't fill them up.  These little tins are less than half filled and at the price charged it seems a rip-off. Is there some exotic ingredient as costly as gold contained in those tiny squares?  Or how about the cereal ploy, they were filled at the factory but settled in transport.<br />Can manufacturers be honest in their dealings?"

    "McCann's Instant Oatmeal is great for quick preparation when you're short on time. It is more convenient than traditional stovetop oatmeal, but not as tasty. However, among instant oatmeal brands, McCann's is the best option, even better than organic brands. The variety pack offers good-tasting options that can be made quickly in the microwave or with boiling water. \n\nOne advantage of McCann's is its use of cane sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup, which makes it a better choice. However, the inclusion of thickeners like guar gum is unnecessary and can make the oatmeal too thick and gluey after sitting for a while.",
    "This instant oatmeal, made by a top oatmeal brand, offers a delightful twist with the use of cane sugar in place of high fructose corn syrup. Some health experts even recommend this form of sugar for its potential benefits. Perfect for hectic mornings when there's no time to prepare McCann's Steel Cut Oats, this oatmeal shines, especially in its apple cinnamon flavor. However, both maple and brown sugar, as well as the regular option, are equally satisfying. The best part? You won't need to make any adjustments to distinguish between the three delicious flavors.",
    "\"Instant oatmeal has the tendency to lose its texture upon contact with water. In contrast, McCann's Instant Oatmeal retains its texture, offers exceptional flavor, and is a nutritious choice.

McCann's Instant Irish Oatmeal emerges as the top instant oatmeal brand in my experience, coming close to the non-instant variant in terms of quality.<br /><br />The McCann's Instant Irish Oatmeal Variety Pack includes Regular, Apples & Cinnamon, and Maple & Brown Sugar flavors, each packed in 10-count boxes (Pack of 6).\"",

Its convenience is definitely noteworthy.",

    "McCann's offers oatmeal for all tastes, from slow-cooking raw pellets to quick microwave options in various flavors. The variety pack allows for exploring different tastes and comparing it to other brands. McCann's cooks up thick and hearty. However, the Apples & Cinnamon flavor can be a bit watery, so adjust water accordingly. The only downside is the need to buy in bulk, with six ten-count boxes per purchase.

During my long desert rides on my dirt bike, my camelbak water was always loaded with the endurolyte powder. It wasn't the tastiest, but it was super effective – I never experienced any cramps during those several hundred-mile rides. The same routine applied to my desert racing in the buggy, with endurolyte powder in the camelbaks. But now, there's the Fizz – what an awesome product! First off, it's Hammer's Endurolyte product, so you know it's top-notch; endurance athletes worldwide use their products. Second, it's super convenient – handy tablets that dissolve into a fizzy drink. And third, it tastes amazing! Picture quenching your thirst with a cool, refreshing lemon-lime or mango drink when your body is craving hydration and electrolytes, instead of that usual salty taste.

The \"zero carb\" sports drinks fell flat, leaving me in a fix. Then one fateful day at my bike store, I stumbled upon these magical tablets... and just like that, problem solved! 🚴‍♂️💦\n\nI've also shared these gems with a couple of friends who were troubled by pesky leg cramps, and guess what? These tablets did the trick for them too! 🌟 Kudos to the brilliant minds behind this superb formulation — they just work wonders! 🌈",

It's not the worst, but I can't help but notice the unpleasant taste every time I take a sip.",

So, I went ahead and got 10lbs... : ) These bears are a tad bigger than other brands and have a slightly sour kick, but it's not too overpowering. I'm a huge fan of grape-flavored candy/soda, and these are pretty tasty. While there's another company that makes slightly better grape gummy bears in my opinion, these are totally worth it for the price. I love using them in homemade Popsicles with flavored sports drink. The salt in the sports drink makes the Popsicles softer, and the frozen gummy bears are just awesome. They're so yummy!",
    "I ordered two of these delectable treats along with two raspberry lattice tarts from FantasiCakes' website for a dinner party I was hosting. When they arrived, they were fresh, intact and a perfect size. I even decided to freeze half for future indulgence. As a pastry enthusiast, I can confidently say that these were the most delicious pastries I've ever had. The soft pastry, flavorful jam, and amazing taste made them disappear in a flash. Needless to say, my guests were thoroughly impressed!",
    "Attention, smart shoppers! Be cautious of this sweetener! Maltitol may not agree with everyone's digestive system. This alcohol sugar can lead to uncomfortable symptoms such as severe bloating, cramping, excessive gas, nausea, diarrhea, and headaches in those who struggle to process it. I learned this lesson firsthand when I indulged in sugar-free chocolates touted by Suzanne Somers. Initially enchanted by the taste, my joy turned into discomfort as maltitol's side effects hit me like a ton of bricks. The bloating and cramping were unbearable, and the aftermath was equally unpleasant. It was challenging to believe that a seemingly harmless sweetener could wreak such havoc, but all my symptoms vanished once I eliminated the chocolate from my diet. My suspicion about maltitol was further confirmed when I unwittingly consumed sugar-free popcorn containing the same culprit. Fortunately, my intake was limited, lessening the duration of my discomfort. While some individuals can enjoy maltitol without issue, others, including myself, must steer clear of it due to adverse reactions. If you've encountered similar challenges, remember, it's not you - it’s the maltitol causing the trouble!",
    "It's not bad, but I wouldn't actively seek it out for a repurchase.",
    "There is a complete absence of tea flavor, only an array of artificial flavors. Unfortunately, it cannot be returned, resulting in a wasted expenditure of over $20.",
    "These seemed ideal for adding to my trail mix, but they arrived as a melted chocolate blob. After storing them in my pantry, they remained gooey when opened at room temperature. Placing them in the fridge, I've been able to break off pieces to enjoy. Although they taste fine to me, the chocolate has a grainy texture due to melting and solidifying. I won't be ordering them online in the future, but I would consider purchasing them in a store.",
    "These are so delicious! I've always bought a different brand, but these taste and feel just like them. I totally agree with the other reviewer about getting these in the summer. Without proper insulation and ice packs, they'll definitely melt in the heat, just like any chocolate product. Make sure to stock up during the cold season - energize your taste buds and grab enough to keep you going!",
    "The flavor was fantastic, although the berries had thawed. Might consider ordering during winter for a delightful taste experience in the chilly weather.",
    "I understand that I may not be able to make tea as delicious as this one. While it is true that I am not from the southern region, I have never had tea that tasted so perfectly sweet without being overwhelming. The flavor is refreshing and crisp.",
    "This peppermint stick is a delightful treat that brings back childhood memories! My dad gifted it to me for Christmas, reminiscing on the time I enjoyed a similar one as a little girl. Even at 30, I still find joy in savoring its delicious flavor!",
    "Perfect for everyone! I bought these oversized candy canes before, and the recipients liked them so much that they decided to keep them as decorations instead of eating them.",
    "Title says Molecular Gastronomy, but don't be scared off. I found this looking for a down-to-earth solution - using it to make my own coffee creamer.<br /><br />I need my coffee blonde and sweet, but the flavored creamers are full of unhealthy fats. I prefer not to use artificial \"food\" items. Cold milk or cream isn't ideal as I like my coffee hot.<br /><br />Discovered this on Amazon and decided to make my own creamer. Bought low-fat and regular milk powder. I prefer mixing 1/3 of each with heavy cream. I also bought cocoa bean powder, vanilla bean powder, and caster sugar for flavoring.<br /><br />This homemade creamer tastes better than store-bought ones. Experiment with flavors and ratios to suit your preferences. It's a fun process to create unique flavors. Consider using essential oils for experimentation.<br /><br />All ingredients mentioned can be found online. Experiment and customize the recipe to your liking. It could also make great gifts.",
    "My dogs enjoy all the flavors we've tried of this dog food, but oddly enough, their itching seemed to worsen when I gave them the lamb and rice variety. My furry friends are quite sensitive and prone to itching, so I'm experimenting with a limited ingredient diet to alleviate their discomfort. Thankfully, the duck and sweet potato option noticeably reduced their itching. I appreciate Natural Balance for its top-notch ingredients and quality.",
    "Upgrade your pet's food to Natural Balance for a truly awesome feeding experience! Witness the remarkable difference when I switched my sensitive \"Boston\" to a different formula. Say goodbye to your pet's itching and restlessness as you explore the wide range of choices offered by Natural Balance. Experiment with each variety until you discover the perfect match that will keep your furry friend happy and healthy.",
    "We own three dogs, and all of them enjoy this food! We purchased it specifically for one of our dogs with food allergies, and it has been very effective for him, eliminating his hot spots and stomach issues. I appreciate the convenience of having it delivered to our door with free shipping.",
    "My dog has numerous allergies, ranging from environmental to food-related. Prior to getting her tested to identify her allergies, she was on a prescription dog food. However, the test results revealed that she was allergic to something in that brand. Thankfully, I eventually discovered a different dog food that has worked wonders for her. While she still has environmental triggers, I am relieved that she can now eat without experiencing any pain.",
    "My shepherd/collie mix suffers from Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). Our veterinarian suggested a limited ingredient diet, which has significantly improved her symptoms and has been well-received by her. Moving forward, I plan to consistently purchase this food from Amazon due to its affordable cost of $10 less and complimentary shipping services.",
    "Natural Balance Dry Dog Food Lamb Meal and Brown Rice Recipe worked wonders for my Jack Russell terrier. She suffers from severe food allergies, and this particular food was our last resort after struggling to find a suitable option that didn't contain any triggering ingredients. While she has no issues eating it dry, I usually mix the Natural Balance Dry Lamb and Brown Rice with the Natural Balance Wet Lamb and Brown Rice, which she seems to prefer. We also introduced this food to our other dog, a Bichon, who also enjoys it. If your dog deals with allergies or digestive problems, or if you simply want to provide them with better nutrition, I highly recommend this product. You will notice a positive change in your pet's health and well-being.",
    "Fantastic cuisine! I am a big fan of the concept of a single food suitable for all ages and breeds. It offers incredible convenience and is truly a top-notch product. With this food, my three dogs eat less, experience minimal gas, and have consistently regular and perfect poops. As a pet parent, what more could I possibly desire!",
    "My standard poodle and pomeranian thrive on this food. Despite trying other options due to cost, I always return to Natural Balance for them.",
    "This dog food is truly outstanding, as it has proven to be the perfect solution for my dog who suffers from severe allergies. Among the myriad of brands available in the market, this particular one stands as the sole option that we can confidently provide our beloved furry friend.",
    "This food is amazing for dogs of all ages! I have a 3-year-old pup and a little puppy, and they are both incredibly healthy and have such soft fur. Plus, the convenience of Amazon Prime shipping makes it even better! 🐾",
    "From a different viewpoint: My golden retriever, unlike any other dog I've known, has very discerning tastes. Despite trying out various dog foods, it turns out she has a preference for natural balance. The thing that captivates me about natural balance is its assortment of flavors in dry and wet forms. Mixing a bit of wet food with her dry kibble seems to be a hit with my golden companion. I enjoy switching up the flavors during mealtimes to keep things interesting, as I believe having the same dish daily could become monotonous. I do avoid the fish variety though, primarily because of the smell it emits.\n\nMoreover, my decision to shift to purchasing from Amazon was prompted by Petco's limited supply of wet food, having only a few cans available. Much to my delight, I discovered that the switch not only provided convenience but also saved me $20 per purchase.\n\nUltimately, I wholeheartedly endorse natural balance dog food and consider it worthy of my approval. While I, personally, have never sampled it, my dog's enthusiastic response speaks for itself.",
    "This is the identical food that we find at the pet store, but it is conveniently delivered to my doorstep! Plus, it's offered at the same price or even slightly cheaper.",
    "I am happy with the Natural Balance dog food because it has resolved the issues my dogs had with other types of dog food. A recommendation led me to try the grain-free option to address potential grain allergies, and since making the switch, my dogs have had no more issues. I appreciate that they offer different kibble sizes for dogs of varying sizes.",
    "My 1-1/2 year old basenji/jack russell mix is obsessed with this dog food! Ever since I switched him over earlier this year, he's been a whole new ball of energy. I was a bit hesitant about the cost of natural dog foods, but it turns out he actually eats less of the Natural Balance dog food and stays super satisfied. He used to munch through 3 cups of regular dog food a day, but now he's happy with just 1 to 1-1/2 cups of Natural Balance. It's like getting more value for your money since you don't have to buy as much, and your pup is healthier and happier for it! And the cherry on top?

    "Our dog had allergies such as hotspots and itching from other dog foods. Cheap, widely available dog foods contain harmful preservatives that can lead to health issues for your pets. This particular food has been incredibly effective in reducing allergies, and our dog absolutely enjoys it. Endorsed by RAMSEY FrAnkenSteiN.",
    "During the summer when we adopted our English Bulldog at 3 years old, he struggled with skin sensitivities. Our vet advised transitioning him away from his former diet of Iams Lamb and Rice to a different option. After experimenting with a couple of choices, we found a new food that has been a game-changer. Specifically formulated for dogs with dietary restrictions and allergies, this food is ideal for those who react to typical additives and proteins in commercial pet food such as chicken or beef.",
    "My Golden Retriever absolutely despised this food – refusing to eat it and suffering from severe diarrhea when he did. We won't purchase it again due to both its high cost and negative impact on our dog.",
    "The mouth says, \"How much do I love you? Let me count the ways...\"<br />If you're a fan of apple products, this is a must-have item. The only downside is the shipping cost, since these items are quite heavy.",
    "The item arrived partially thawed, which my parents were not willing to accept. Nonetheless, the company provided excellent support and granted a full refund.",
    "The crust on these tarts is absolutely perfect! My husband adores them, and my kids think they're amazing. While they might be a tad too sour/tart for my liking, I still love indulging in the delicious crust. It seems like everyone in my family is raving about them!",
    "These are undeniably delicious! Both my husband and I thoroughly enjoy them. However, as another customer has pointed out, the shipping charges are exorbitant. The cost of shipping exceeds that of the tartlets themselves.",
    "This delightful treat is a perfect twist on classic apple pie - no slicing or dicing required! With its easy preparation and ability to make fresh batches whenever craving strikes, it's a must-try.",
    "I enjoy Creme Brulee because it is easy to make. Just sprinkle the included sugar and broil it. It looks and tastes great. My guests thought I put a lot of effort into making them, but it only took 5 minutes. I will be ordering more!",
    "This exceeded my expectations in light of the company's renowned reputation for outstanding home delivery products.",
    "I discovered pickled asparagus at an Amish market and loved it. So, when I found them on sale at Safeway, I bought them all. They are better than the ones from the Amish market, with some even containing a bonus clove of garlic. I will be ordering a six-pack even though I live alone because they are that good and won't go to waste.",
    "I love asparagus! I had never tried pickled asparagus until just recently. Let me tell you, when my friend brought out this brand, I was blown away by how delicious it was. I enjoyed it so much that I ended up buying the six-pack. Now I only have 2 jars left. Looks like I'll have to stock up soon!",
    "Currently, I am following a diet and recently visited my local Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Grocery store to explore diet-friendly food options. I was seeking tasty, non-fat, and low-calorie items, and ended up purchasing about twelve products. During this shopping trip, I stumbled upon Tillen Farms Pickled Crispy Asparagus, which caught my attention. As a fan of asparagus and pickled vegetables in general, I have tried several brands before, but Tillen Farms stands out as exceptionally delicious. The asparagus has a wonderful flavor, and I am excited about the large garlic clove at the bottom of the jar. Surprisingly, each jar is only 60 calories, making it a top choice for my diet menu.",
    "I did not enjoy the flavor and texture of this mix. Generally, I like most of the Low Carb products I have tried, but this specific one let me down.",
    "I have been consuming this tea for an extended period. Previously, I would procure it exclusively from a medical facility since it was not easily accessible elsewhere. I am pleased to note that I now have the convenience of purchasing it from Amazon.com. I incorporate this tea into my daily routine, akin to how others may engage with coffee. It boasts a delightful flavor profile.",
    "I have been enjoying Royal King 100% Natural Organic Green Tea, which comes in packs of 100 tea bags weighing 2g each, as my go-to daily tea for a number of years now. To save on shipping costs, I purchase 12 boxes at a time. Previously, I used to consume coffee throughout the day, but eventually realized that excessive coffee intake was impacting my health negatively. Consequently, I made the decision to prioritize my well-being and completely gave up coffee. In my search for a suitable replacement, I discovered that not only does green tea offer a pleasant taste, but it also boasts numerous health benefits. Unlike other beverages, green tea is known to contribute positively to one's health, with the exception being high-quality cold water. In my experience, Royal King 100% Natural Organic Green Tea stands out as one of the most delicious options available at its price range. With its lovely golden hue and fresh, vibrant flavor, it has become a staple in my collection. For those looking to add sweetness and extra health benefits, I suggest incorporating a small amount of Y.S. Organic Bee Farms RAW HONEY into the tea. While I do indulge in a more expensive tea, Tribute Xi Hu Long Jing, occasionally as a treat, it is not a practical choice for everyday consumption due to its cost. \n\nIn terms of drawbacks, my latest order differed from the product displayed on the Amazon page. The package I received indicates that the tea is \"NATURALLY HIGH IN POLYPHENOL CATECHINS,\" which are known to potentially contribute to the health benefits of tea, while the Amazon listing states \"CAFFEINE FREE.\" This discrepancy has left me uncertain about whether the green tea is caffeine-free or not. Additionally, I have encountered issues where the tea bags tear open when I try to unwrap the string tied around them. In such cases, I remedy the situation by placing the bag in hot water to loosen the string.",
    "This tea is one of the best I've ever tasted. It's clean, bright, and fresh. The delivery was great, and the quality is top-notch. You should definitely give it a try.",
    "I really enjoy this green tea, which is difficult to find locally and often expensive online. However, I was able to get a good deal on multiple boxes from this seller. I am very satisfied with my purchase and will definitely order from them again. Green tea is a daily must-have for me.",
    "I adore this tea as it effectively suppresses my appetite throughout the day. My mother and I have graciously shared it with all our friends for them to experience.",
    "I am Italian and resided in Italy for several years. I would purchase these cookies regularly for my morning breakfast along with an authentic Italian espresso. I searched everywhere in the Bay area but couldn't find them, so I am delighted to enjoy them once more.",
    "I spent numerous summers in Italy during the 1980s and discovered this biscotti, which was commonly enjoyed as a morning meal or afternoon treat. Back then, they were not readily available in the US, but luckily, I brought two bags back from my recent visit to Italy. It's wonderful to see that they are now accessible on Amazon! Opening a bag, savoring the aroma, pouring a glass of milk, and dipping the Macines in it make for a delightful routine and a special treat for children.",
    "I heard about this product from the local pet store and decided to give it a try for our two cats, who are around 3 and 6 years old. The younger female cat loved it right away, while the older male cat, who had been raised on not-so-great cat food filled with corn meal, surprisingly took a liking to it too. He's a bit plump, and we were advised by the vet to switch him to soft food, which he refused until we found this one. He's a fancy cat, after all! Although he still eats a lot, at least I know he's getting quality food. Yes, this product may cost more than others, but I'd rather pay extra for something I trust than settle for low-quality options that claim to be healthy. Why do commercials show cats eating a vegetarian diet filled with corn meal? Doesn't seem right, does it? For now, I'll stick with this product, but who knows what the future holds.\n\nUpdating this review after 9 months of using this cat food for our feline duo. I've bumped up my rating from 4 to 5 stars because it has truly been great for both of them. Garfield still eats a bit too much, but hey, he's a big guy who's not into exercise, let's be real. Our female cat is turning 4 soon and she's the picture of health - tiny, happy, and agile. I tried the chicken flavor of Holistic Select, but Garfield seemed to prefer this sardine one, so we switched back. I've also ordered the duck version and will update once they've given it a taste test.",
    "I began purchasing this product when I noticed my 1-year-old cat was starting to lose his energy. I felt it was time to upgrade to high-quality cat food from the pet store, rather than the options at regular supermarkets. Among the plethora of choices available, I selected this brand to give it a try, and it turned out to be an excellent decision. After feeding this to my cat for the last 8 months, he is now as playful as he was in his kitten days, and his fur has grown remarkably soft. Notably, he absolutely loves the taste! I enthusiastically recommend this brand to my friends and family for their pets.",
    "I conducted extensive research to discover the most suitable food for my cat, and I can confidently say that this particular food is exceptional. It comes highly recommended by my holistic veterinarian as well. What sets it apart is the inclusion of probiotics on the kibble itself, a crucial aspect for me. The most remarkable aspect is that my cat took to it right away; she enjoyed it so much that I had to discontinue mixing it with her previous food as she only wanted to eat Holistic Select.",
    "My vet suggested this cat food for my 13-year-old Cleo Cat who was having a hard time keeping anything down and was losing weight. And guess what - it did the trick! She's not eating as much as before, but she seems more content after meals, which makes the higher price worth it. Plus, it works wonders for her digestion - no more unpleasant scents, if you catch my drift. Had to mention it so folks with similar cat issues know there are some serious perks to this food.",
    "\"My lively 4-year-old tomcat is a champion of battles against chronic urinary tract infections! To keep him in tip-top shape, I mix his dry food with wet food enhanced with water, and a dash of Uri Ease. This winning combo works wonders in keeping his UTIs at bay. I've noticed whenever I try a different dry food option, his UTIs flare up like fireworks! Not only does my fur baby benefit from this special diet, but our other feline companions can't get enough of it too. Though it may be a bit pricey, it's a small price to pay for their health and happiness!\"",
    "Previously, I did not have knowledge about feline nutrition and inadvertently let my cats develop a dependence on dry cat food. Although I always provided both canned and dry food options, I now realize the importance of feeding them premium quality canned food and limiting their dry food intake. I am the pet parent of two 15-year-old cats and two 5-year-old cats. The only dry foods of good quality that they enjoy are Wellness and Innova. Recently, Innova was acquired by Procter & Gamble, prompting me to search for a suitable replacement. After trying various samples provided by my local holistic pet store, I found that Holistic Select was the only alternative, aside from the usual Wellness and Innova, that they would eat. For cats with discerning taste preferences, I suggest considering Holistic Select. This brand offers high-quality food that appeals to finicky eaters.",
    "My holistic veterinarian has graciously suggested this particular brand, among several others. After exploring various options, my feline companions have unequivocally shown a preference for this selection, particularly the sardine variant. I am delighted to witness the transformation in their fur, which has become remarkably soft and clean, and their eyes that gleam with clarity. Furthermore, I have observed that their elimination process has noticeably reduced in odor, a marked improvement over the results seen in cats consuming mainstream, low-quality products. The evident health advantages are compelling, leading me to wholeheartedly endorse Holistic Select.",
    "One of my felines is intolerant to fish and beef. This particular formula is among the limited options suitable for her consumption, boasting superior ingredients compared to the prescribed diets obtainable at the veterinarian. Both of my beloved cats exhibit great agility, possess lustrous coats, and maintain a healthy weight. Furthermore, the consumption of dry food aids in diminishing tartar accumulation on their teeth.",
    "Our feline friends absolutely love this dry cat food, leading to fewer hairball incidents and healthier, lustrous fur. They have maintained a perfect weight and top-notch fitness. The vendor's ultra-fast shipping service has truly impressed us, making them one of our favorite Amazon suppliers!",
    "I have been a dedicated enthusiast of the zesty Hot & Spicy Maruchan Ramen for quite some time now. If you appreciate heat and have a passion for ramen, this particular product is sure to captivate your taste buds. It's a pity that the price point on Amazon is remarkably high; however, I am pleased to report that it is available for just $3.36 for a pack of twelve at my local Walmart.",
    "I've been eating Ramen noodles ever since I was a kid, and out of all the flavors I've tried, Hot & Spicy Chicken is still my favorite! Even though it's not very spicy for someone who loves chili, it's just so delicious!",
    "I'm OBSESSED with spicy ramen! But man, this stuff lights a FIRE in my stomach and the burning sensation lasts for a good 3 HOURS! Is that even good for me? And guess what? You can snag it at Walmart for just $0.28, a STEAL compared to Amazon!",
    "Being a fan of ramen for its convenience, coming across it on Amazon at a good price and having it delivered in bulk to your doorstep is a fantastic opportunity for anyone.",
    "I must confess to a certain sensitivity, for this soup carries a heat akin to what one might attribute to fire itself. While I generally appreciate spiciness when accompanied by robust flavors, this particular offering seems to lack such harmony. The overpowering burn eclipses any potential for nuanced taste profiles.",
    "I enjoyed the spicy taste of these noodles. Surprisingly, I preferred the broth over the noodles, contrary to my usual preference. If you're not accustomed to spiciness, this dish might be too much for you. On the other hand, if you enjoy very spicy food, this may not be spicy enough for your liking.",
    "I snagged these for just 25 cents a cup on sale - that's half the price I usually pay at my local grocery stores! On top of that, they hardly ever have the spicy flavors in stock. These are the perfect quick snack for my busy office days when there's no time for a proper meal. This Instant Lunch flavor is definitely one of my top picks, and I'll keep coming back for more every time it's on sale!",
    "I have purchased a variety of flavors, but this one stands out as a personal favorite! I'll definitely be stocking up on more of these soon.",
    "I'm absolutely obsessed with this ramen flavor! It's so delicious that other ramen flavors just don't cut it for me anymore - they taste way too bland in comparison. Thanks to my Prime membership, I can have it delivered straight to my door in just two days without any extra shipping costs. Although the price on Amazon is reasonable, I still find it more cost-effective to make a quick trip to the store to grab a case of my favorite ramen.",
    "The greatest investment I've ever made is in this ginger! It's truly incredible - fibrous like fresh ginger with a spicy kick that pairs perfectly with sugar to create a harmonious balance. Spending $40 on 5lbs of it was absolutely worth it! I'll definitely be purchasing more soon, as I love using this ginger as a delicious topping for my ginger cupcakes and cookies.",
    "This ginger is delicious. It's hard to find Australian ginger where I live, but this one is just as good as what I've bought in other cities. I'm glad I can now enjoy it without having to travel.",
    "I have tried other cheaper brands, but I realize that this ginger is definitely worth the money. It is tender, moist, and never disappoints.",
    "My child has been experiencing acid reflux from the time of birth and has tried every medicine possible without any progress. Then, an elderly man at his workplace shared this product with him, and I immediately purchased it. I didn't anticipate better outcomes compared to the numerous other remedies we had attempted. To my amazement, from the second day of consuming a piece of this Ginger each morning, he has not experienced any heartburn or symptoms. Now, he can savor any food with pleasure. This item truly was a blessing for him. I am grateful to all involved in creating it!",
    "I purchased this for our office to offer people a sweet snack option. Its bite-size pieces make it convenient for individuals to grab a few pieces rather than a whole licorice stick. My only issue is that one of the bags tore open during shipping.",
    "Twizzlers brand licorice reigns supreme over its well-known competitor! 🌟 Snag a package for just $2 to $2.50, shipping included, and you've got yourself a sweet steal. 😋 While the black and cherry flavors pack a flavorful punch, the subtle strawberry taste might leave you wanting more. 🍓",
    "I absolutely adore these delectable treats! In fact, I believe I'm utterly addicted to them.<br />Purchasing them in packs of 6 bags is not only a smart choice but a cost-effective one compared to buying single bags at Target. The savings amount to about $1.00 per bag! I rely on subscribe and save for these and many other products. The convenience and benefits of subscribe and save simply astound me!",
    "Looking for a cleaner alternative to licorice for the kids? Give these a try! They're soft, chewy, and won't leave your hands sticky when you're on the go - whether in the car, at the beach, or during the summer. We enjoy the various flavors and sometimes pair them with chocolate for a delightful snack. Excellent product, budget-friendly, definitely a must-try!",
    "The pieces in this bag seem to have been purposely shrunk in size, most likely to create the illusion of getting a greater quantity at a better price. Unfortunately, this minimization compromises the flavor intensity of each piece, requiring you to consume 2 or 3 to equal the original size. This significant change undermines the quality of your eating experience.",
    "I have been a fan of Newman's Pineapple salsa for a long time and recently sought a similar alternative. The Berry Mango salsa I found is one of the most delicious salsas I have ever tried. My daughters also enjoy it due to its smooth texture with small mango pieces. This salsa strikes the perfect balance of sweetness and mild heat, making it a great value at its price point.",
    "The salsa emitted a delightful aroma, suggesting its high quality. Unfortunately, upon inspection, it was revealed that the packaging lacked sufficient protection, resulting in breakage of the bottoms of all three bottles. When I sought to address this issue by inquiring about a return, I was informed that food items are non-returnable. Subsequently, my attempt to locate customer service details on the company's redesigned website proved futile. While the company evidently takes pride in its new image, it is essential for them to provide a readily accessible point of contact for urgent matters. For instance, as a frequent purchaser of items, such as glass containers, that necessitate careful handling, it is imperative that proper packaging is employed. Utilizing a cardboard box with minimal protective measures, like a single layer of large bubble wrap, increases the risk of breakage during transit, even with a diligent carrier like FedEx. These concerns, particularly when dealing with delicate goods like salsa, should not be overlooked.",
    "This salsa is truly a gem that I recently discovered - a real standout! However, I recommend steering clear of the variety pack as the other two options included are simply not worth the hype or your hard-earned cash.",
    "They remind me of dog treats I made with pumpkin and cinnamon. They're bland and not my favorite Back To Nature product, but my fiance really loves them, hence the three-star rating.",
    "This cornmeal is superb. I used it to make delicious regular cornbread and hot water cornbread, both of which turned out outstanding. I also fried some oysters with this cornmeal, enhancing their texture and flavor.",
    "This marinade is fantastic! I enjoy using it for chicken, whether baked in the oven or grilled. It's full of flavor and flair, and I've even served it at dinner parties to great reviews from my guests! Definitely a worthwhile purchase - affordable and simple to use. I love it!",
    "Transform your chicken, fish, beef, or pork into delectable masterpieces effortlessly. Elevate the taste to perfection. Enjoy huge savings of over 50% when you purchase in bulk compared to retail stores.",
    "Purchased this product for my brother, who is adhering to the Jorge Cruise diet, and decided to sample it myself. I must admit that the flavor was quite pleasing.",
    "Hazelnut coffee creamer is my favorite, but it's weird that Amazon is selling it for $9.99 for a box of 24 singles when you can get it for $2.50 - $3.36 at the store. It's definitely not a good deal.",
    "I'm thrilled with this yummy flavor! It's a great healthy alternative to our usual desserts. I'm glad I tried it because Jello desserts offer endless delicious possibilities while still being good for you. I'll definitely buy this product again - the flavor was absolutely wonderful.",
    "I searched 4 grocery stores to find this delicious Jello flavor for my green tomato jam recipe, and I was thrilled to finally find it here! This Jello is amazing! It seems to only be available during the summer, and with fall harvest approaching, I couldn't locate it anywhere else in town. The watermelon flavor of this Jello is fantastic, and the jam I made with it tastes just like watermelon jam! It's also great as regular Jello. So yummy!",
    "This salt is a great choice for optimal health. This box will easily last our family for a year. Unlike regular salt, iodized sea salt won't increase your blood pressure.",
    "Ideal sea salt for your table or picnic basket – it shakes well, doesn't clump, and flows freely. A must-have!",
    "The expiration date for this product is 21 months from the date of purchase. This delicious tuna and tomato combination is among the items I frequently reorder from Amazon. I have included a brief video to provide a visual of this pairing. While I initially filmed the video with a headlamp, the focus on the tuna was not satisfactory. Considering the minimal views on this product, I am unsure whether redoing the video would be necessary.",
    "I had never come across the SAFCOL brand previously, but I wanted a change from the usual pouches like Starkist and Chicken of the Sea. I found SAFCOL to be surprisingly better than the others with a more subtle seasoning.",
    "These tuna packs are the best-tasting in my opinion. They make a great on-the-go snack and are really satisfying with the tomato.",
    "I typically go for Star-Kist tuna, but decided to mix things up by giving this brand a shot. Unfortunately, the flavors were overpowering with too much basil and other spices, and it just didn't hit the spot for me.",
    "I haven't heard of Safcol before, but since I love tuna, I decided to try it. The tuna is good quality, but I thought the tomato basil flavor was a bit boring. It's better than plain tuna, but it didn't have the strong taste I was expecting. However, it's a good choice for a low-calorie, low-fat meal.",
    "I thought this was more delicious compared to regular tuna pouches available. It is of high quality and doesn't require any additional seasoning. I heated it in the microwave at 20% power for 1 minute and it was perfect! I think heating it a little enhances the flavor.",
    "This product was extremely bland. Despite there being tastier alternatives available, it is a better choice calorie-wise compared to a Special K bar or a cookie snack pack. You can enhance its flavor by seasoning it or pairing it with another food item.",
    "I discovered pomegranate molasses and had to try it. It's decadent with a dark, syrupy, sour, and slightly sweet taste. A dab makes me forget about dessert. It has a unique flavor with a pleasing metallic undertone. Planning to make fesenjan next. Yum!",
    "Try this out in Moroccan dishes, mix it into a delicious drink, or drizzle it on sliced oranges with a touch of orange water. It's absolutely amazing!",
    "I had to discard half of the beans since they had been sitting at the back of a shelf for an unknown duration and were too old to cook properly, exhibiting damaged skins indicating they were past their prime. Unfortunately, I can't return or get a refund for them due to the non-returnable policy on food items. I'll look for a new brand to purchase in the future. In the meantime, I have around fifty servings of beans that need to be disposed of.",
    "Smaller than banana runts, these candies may look similar and have the same texture. However, they do not taste like banana runts and are not enjoyable. I am planning to return them to the vendor.",
    "The overall quality of the item was good, but the Banana Heads are significantly smaller than Banana Runts. Upon receiving the package, I was disappointed to find the Banana Heads had spilled out due to poor packaging, littering the entire envelope.",
    "I bought them as baby shower favors with a Jungle theme, perfect for 25 small bags of candy. I purchased 5#; for more than 25 bags, buy a larger size.",
    "I've been enjoying Ricore ever since my mother let me start drinking caffeine. I particularly love it mixed with milk. It has a smoother and more delightful taste compared to instant coffee with milk. As a French person living in the US, I make sure to bring back boxes of Ricore whenever I can. Savora is another hidden gem worth bringing back. Be sure to give it a try!",
    "Key points emphasized: First tried drink from mother, brought from Brittany France, found delicious, wishes it were cheaper, loves the product overall.\n\nRewritten: The drink came from my mother's trip to Brittany, France, and it tasted delicious! Although it could be more affordable, I absolutely adore this product.",
    "I was excited to sample the 8-inch Cinnamon Coffee Cake because it is crafted using fresh ingredients like eggs, sour cream, and Madagascar Bourbon Vanilla, and is generously topped and filled with cinnamon streusel. This delectable cake can be purchased online for just $18.95. Having enjoyed various cinnamon coffee cakes in the past, I must say that the FantasiCakes Cinnamon Coffee Cake truly stands out in terms of its size, affordability, quality, and flavor.\n\nUpon arrival, the cake was promptly delivered and thoughtfully packaged to ensure almost pristine condition. It even includes a generous tub of white icing for drizzling before serving. I was pleasantly surprised by the generous size of the cake; it was enough to satisfy my family of 5 for breakfast over three days. The cake itself is dense and moist, akin to a sponge cake, offering a satisfying texture. The blend of sticky cinnamon on the outside and sweet cinnamon and vanilla swirled inside creates an irresistible flavor profile. The icing adds a perfect finishing touch, enhancing the overall moist and sweet taste. Enjoy a slice with your morning coffee for a delightful breakfast treat!",
    "I used to enjoy these when I was younger, savoring the combination of water and lemon juice from this brand. However, about 5-6 years ago, I stopped consuming it. The flavor used to be very bold, and just a small sip would give me an invigorating feeling. It seems that the product has undergone some changes over time, possibly adding more water to reduce its intensity. The stronger it was, the less you needed to use. While the product is still of good quality, its taste now resembles that of cheaper brands. I had expected these to disappear quickly, as I adore all things lemony, unless they go bad. This remains a good product, but I do miss the intense chug-worthy sensation it used to provide.",
    "One of the best lemon juices I've tried. I'm a repeat customer because of its high quality. It's a great supplement when fresh lemons are not available for cooking or drinks. I will keep buying it.",
    "This lemon juice is an essential kitchen staple that adds a burst of flavor to any dish with just a small amount. I incorporate a splash of it into my daily routine, enhancing the taste of my meals and beverages. Its bold taste and versatility make it a must-have ingredient year-round. I am committed to purchasing this product repeatedly.",
    "Prompt delivery and high-quality product. This lemon juice concentrate is identical to what you would find in stores and is incredibly convenient for enhancing sauces, dressings, and more. The hassle of juicing fresh lemons every time you need it, not to mention always having lemons on hand, is a thing of the past.",
    "This is not as delicious as the Chilled Lime juice, but it is tasty. It has a slightly peculiar taste, maybe due to a preservative. I really hope I could purchase the chilled juice!",
    "I was so surprised to hear how chill this drink is! Seriously, just have it if you're winding down for a nap or bedtime. Not a good idea if you're about to drive or do anything else important.<br /><br />My arms and legs almost feel like they're tingling with relaxation. Before long, my eyes start getting droopy and I'm off in dreamland.<br /><br />I'm totally into this stuff.",
    "I recently picked up a case of twelve from Grocery Outlet in the Seattle-Tacoma region for just $4.00 - a major bargain compared to the $38.00 original price! At just 3 for a dollar, it's quite a steal. The taste is decent - not the best, but definitely not the worst. Plus, it's low in calories. I might grab more, but not unless the price comes back down to reality!",
    "This product is excellent. It tastes great and works just as it says. It's a fantastic natural sleep helper. Awesome!",
    "We've been exploring natural remedies to aid our sleep in light of our high levels of stress and busy schedules. While attending a yoga class would likely be more beneficial, this alternative method is a good second choice. This solution is great for helping both to fall asleep and to stay asleep. I consumed half of it on the first night, which was sufficient. Within 30 minutes, I was ready to hit the hay! I woke up feeling rejuvenated and without any grogginess, which was a major advantage.\n\nI rated the product 3 stars instead of the 5 it truly deserves due to the subpar packaging. The shipment contained two broken bottles, resulting in a loss of $6 at this price point! The glass bottles were inadequately wrapped with just a single layer of small-bubbled bubble wrap before being placed in a larger box with excess room for movement. Although the packaging fell short, the product itself is excellent.",
    "We baked delicious chocolate chip cookies using BRM Garbanzo Bean Flour and the outcome was amazing! The combination of brown sugar and chocolate effectively masks any bean flavor mentioned in other reviews. Our friends couldn't even tell the difference from traditional chocolate chip cookies. The texture is wonderfully chewy, with a good body and elasticity that prevents the cookies from falling apart, unlike most other gluten-free flours. Additionally, the high protein and fiber content make these cookies filling, allowing you to feel satisfied with smaller portions and benefitting from a lower glycemic index. I highly recommend this flour, especially for making chocolate chip cookies.",
    "This is fantastic! I whipped up a batch of delicious banana bread using this great quality product at the best price in town.",
    "We had difficulty finding this item locally, but the delivery was quick, saving us from having to search the flour aisle at our local grocery stores.",
    "This glaze packet is the key ingredient for creating classic European-style fresh fruit tarts. I am preparing one for a pie auction at church, following a request for a \"strawberry\" themed dessert. By baking a base, layering it with raw fresh sliced fruit, and pouring the contents of one of these packets over it, you can craft stunning and somewhat \"healthier\" fruit tarts. The glaze sets at room temperature, securing the fruit in place for easy slicing while showcasing the beauty of the arranged fruit. Additionally, this glaze can be used over cheesecakes, providing a stable base for a fruit topping. While I'm not a fan of cheesecake due to its richness, a fruit-glazed cheesecake is undeniably beautiful. To achieve this, adorn the cheesecake with sliced fruit while it is still in the springform pan, then pour on the glaze, allowing it to set before removing the pan to reveal a translucent layer of fruit on top of the cheesecake. Cherries, strawberries, or sliced mangos work well, but my favorite variation includes delicate slices of lemons that have been gently poached in sugar syrup before being layered on the cake.\n\nFor the tart base, I prefer using a sponge cake baked in a shallow pan; however, other options such as pate sucre (a French pastry similar to a sugar cookie) are suitable for fluted straight-sided forms. Mini tarts can also be made using a muffin pan by pre-baking each mold with a layer of pie crust or pate sucre for better shape and texture. After blind-baking the pate-lined muffin tins, fill them with fresh fruits, pour over the glaze, and for added richness, add a layer of creme patisserie beneath the fruit. This pastry cream-like custard stabilized with flour enhances the flavor of these mini tarts.\n\nIf you're passionate about baking, this glaze is a kitchen essential. The vegan ingredients—tapioca starch, carrageenan, dextrose, cream of tartar, and locust bean gum—make it versatile for use in vegan tofu cheesecakes and fruit tarts with a nut crust base.",
    "My Scotties were riddled with hot spots, but after just one week of using this product, all the hot spots were completely eradicated! The scent is quite powerful, but not unpleasant - totally bearable!",
    "I chose this coffee due to its affordability compared to Ganocafe, and it contains organic reishi mushroom along with other beneficial antioxidants. Surprisingly, it not only tastes delightful but is also a great value for just $5. While my sisters are loyal to Ganocafe, I am excited to introduce them to this more economical yet comparable option. I plan to provide an update on my experience with this product in a few weeks. :)",
    "This coffee is meticulously crafted, but its flavor falls short of remarkable. While Nescafe and Mount Hagen reign supreme in my book, I ventured to diversify my options with this choice—only to find myself hesitant to repurchase. A subtle hint of a \"vitaminy\" undertone is present, though not overpowering. Factor in its steep price, and the overall value may leave you wanting more.",
    "This coffee is fantastic with organic ingredients and no pesticides. It also tastes good and offers the healing effects of ganoderma.",
    "Discover the incredible taste of this coffee that stands out from the rest. I've enjoyed various instant coffees in the past, but this one truly stands out as one of the best. If you're looking to experience another one of my top picks (non-organic), give 'Africafe pure instant coffee' a try.",
    "I really enjoy this product! It tastes amazing and gives me a nice energy boost without any jitters. However, I do wish it came in a resealable jar or a sturdy plastic container instead of a zip-lock pouch. The zip-lock didn't last long and ended up ripping off. The product itself is fantastic, but I'm not a big fan of the packaging.",
    "These miniature mints are not only delicious but also provide a refreshing sensation. I typically consume salads for lunch, which can sometimes result in unpleasant breath. Consuming two of these mints post-lunch, due to their small size, effectively addresses this issue. Moreover, these mints are sugar-free, eliminating the risk of promoting the growth of odor-causing bacteria. Their enjoyable taste makes me consider them as an integral part of my lunch routine. Overall, purchasing these mints in bulk represents good value, and I highly endorse their use. Cheers!",
    "I prefer these over the regular Altoids, but they are definitely more expensive, so you better enjoy them.",
    "Check out these amazing sugar-free mint tins! Perfect for on-the-go, each tin contains fifty mints – just the right amount to conveniently carry with you. Not only are they better for your teeth compared to sugary alternatives, but at just twelve dollars, they're also a fantastic deal. Share them with friends and family and discover the refreshing taste for yourself. Don't miss out – try these mints today and you won't be disappointed!",
    "Pros:\n- Great packaging, shipping, and price\n- Purchased within a year of expiration (enough to eat/share 9 boxes)\n- Authentic mint flavor, not too fresh or powdery\n\nCons: None",
    "\"Make sure you don't consume a large quantity of these in one day because one of the chemicals it contains acts as a laxative. Haha!\"",
    "These mints pack a powerful punch of flavor that will leave your taste buds tingling! Not only are they bursting with taste, but they are also the perfect size to conveniently carry in your pocket or purse.",
    "This is an incredibly massive supply of them! I'm still hard at work on these and have loads to spare! So much better than constantly buying one from the grocery store or 7-11 whenever you need a mint!",
    "It seems like these little tins are less than half filled at the price charged – what a rip-off! Could there be some exotic ingredient as precious as gold packed in those tiny squares? Or could it be a sneaky cereal ploy, filled at the factory but settling in transport? Can manufacturers be trustworthy in their dealings?"
