    "The world has been shattered by Russia’s attack on Ukraine in the past few days. Ukraine’s forces have put up remarkable resistance to this attack, but the war is entering an even bloodier phase. Europe could be witnessing the first major military invasion in years. Many people have been displaced, and many Ukrainian citizens have fled neighboring countries for peace. Gunshots and artillery fires have been raining down on residential areas in Ukraine, with several media houses and newspapers reporting the events and sharing the news with the rest of the world. Various newspapers have reported the news differently, with the difference seen in headlines, videos and images posted. The two newspapers covering the events in Ukraine are the New York Times and Le Monde, a French newspaper. While New York Times and Le Monde report the same event, the two use very different terms to describe similar activities. In the recent takeover of the city of Kharkiv by the Russian forces, for example, the NYT headline read “Russian Troops Take Over Kharkiv,” Le Monde , on the other hand, read “La Russie A Envahi Kharkiv” to mean “Russia Has Invaded Kharkiv.” Recently a video of Ukrainian citizens making Molotov cocktail Petrol bombs was shared. The headline in NYT read, “Ukraine Prepare Molotov Cocktail In Kyiv.” Le Monde ‘s headline read “Ukrainian Resistance Using Molotov Bombs.” Because headlines are the deciding factor for people to read an article, newspapers make them enticing. The New York Times uses headlines that suggest this is another world war, while Le Monde downplays the illegality of what Russia is doing. The differences seen in the headlines of the two newspapers are all for the attraction of their audiences; each magazine writes eye-catching unique topics.",
    "Charles Schwab is a for-profit Corporation whose main business is savings and loans. The company provides banking and asset management services, and financial advisory. It has several subsidiaries – Charles Schwab & Co., Inc., Charles Schwab Investment Management, Inc., TD Ameritrade, Inc., and TD Ameritrade Clearing, Inc., which are all limited liability companies (“The Charles Schwab Corporation,” 2021). This paper aims to analyze the form of business in Charles Schwab Corporation (CSC). Charles Schwab is a corporation, which is a form of business with some distinctive features. Firstly, its officers are agents, unlike its directors and shareholders, which means that the latter are not involved in the company’s current strategic, managerial and other business decisions (“Corporation,” 2022). Secondly, the corporation is managed by the board of directors who have the right to appoint the officers. This approach creates a balance of managerial forces, since CEOs and CFOs are directly involved in the work processes, and the board of directors, in extreme cases, has the right to dismiss them by voting. In the corporation, shareholders are free to transfer ownership, which means that in critical situations such as bankruptcy, the corporation can be sold to another owner. This outcome is possible because the corporation is an organization that creates an opportunity for investors to profit by investing, unlike an LLC (“Forming a corporation,” 2022). Finally, in corporations, the income is taxed twice: the first time at the corporate level, and a second time if dividends are distributed to shareholders. Thus, the form of business in Charles Schwab Corporation was analyzed. The CSC is a corporation with several subsidiaries and conducts business following the requirements for a corporation form of organization. A distinctive feature of corporations is the board of directors, which has an indirect influence on daily decision-making. Still, in critical cases, it can appoint new officers to manage the company. Corporations can also transfer property rights in the event of bankruptcy or other cases.",
    "The work of a clinical or medical office worker is characterized by a combination of a large number of administrative operations with medical activities. Primarily, these professionals are office assistants filling out paperwork and interacting with staff (“How to become a medical office assistant,” 2021). As a result, I will be approaching interviews for this job in a professional business style. While the fitting suit can be expensive, I already have the proper formal attire. Using my black formal suit, shoes, and minimal accessories, I can make the right impression without reducing my budget. In warm weather, I can go to an interview right in a suit, and in cold weather, I can add my usual outerwear, for example, an overcoat. Work clothes, theoretically, may require additional investments and purchases. All healthcare workers, including office workers, must wear a special uniform called scrubs, consisting of a short-sleeved shirt and trousers. This uniform is relatively cheap, and a single set of scrubs can be found on Amazon for about $20-$40 (“Medical assistant’s uniform,” 2019). Most of all, in this context, one needs to take care of shoes since these specialists sometimes have to stand or walk a lot. A good pair of closed-toe shoes can cost around $100, but I have tennis shoes that fit the dress code (“Medical assistant’s uniform,” 2019). However, it must be taken into account that many medical institutions issue uniforms on their own, considering them as consumables, so the choice of purchasing a uniform will depend on the rules of a particular hospital. In any case, it is simple and easy to wear, so it will not entail high costs. Reflecting on the points studied and prepared, I want to note that the new information will affect my budget and life plan very little. In the best case, if the hospital issues uniforms, I won’t have to spend any money at all, as I can wear my existing suit for the interview and shoes for work. In the worst case, I will still be within the budget when I have to buy everything for work. Therefore, I can put that $200 aside and mentally prepare for possible demands from my interviewers. In addition, this study showed that the issue of clothing for interviews and work is not a problem for me, and I am already prepared for it in many respects.",
    "Carl Jung identifies the mother complex with an innate feeling of care at the center of the emotional attachment between a mother and a child. However, in the absence of such an attachment, an archetype develops where someone’s mother fails to satisfy the essential demands associated with the relationship. The outcome leads the victim, the child, to seek comfort elsewhere (Bobroff 35). At the core of the mother complex is the mother archetype, meaning that in every emotional attachment, between the child and the mother, on the one hand, an archetype nourishing and security image manifests. On the other hand, an archetype that devours possessiveness, deprivation, and darkness comes out (Bobroff 36). In the film Every Secret Thing , a complex emotional attachment between Alice and her mother exists and forms the underlying relationship between the two and the association with the kidnaps taking place. The complex relationship between Alice and her mother places Alice at the center of the kidnapping. Hellen is disgusted by Alice to the point of considering Ronnie her child of choice, a position that makes Alice deeply insecure. Moreover, the tension in interracial affairs is associated with the second kidnapping and having born a biracial child while in prison, and given it up for adoption, Alice becomes the primary suspect in the case (Berg). Alice’s mother, the mastermind behind the kidnap, in the first and second cases, and murder, in the first case, plants evidence to ensure Alice stands out as the main suspect. Hellen, through betrayal and deception, purposely Alice ends up in prison (Berg). Further, compared to the indifference in Ronnie’s parents, there is no emotional attachment between the parents and their daughters. As the film comes to an end, the audience learns that not only were Alice and Ronnie falsely imprisoned, the justice system failed to prove that Helen is the killer.",
    "The article describes a recent Chicago hot dog restaurant incident that can be considered an ethical issue. The incident involved a man who was asked to wear a mask to use the restaurant’s services (Sutton, 2022). In response, the man offended the restaurant employee by throwing snow in their face several times (Sutton, 2022). Additionally, the offender broke the glass door with an unknown object (Sutton, 2022). This incident can be considered an ethical issue because the offender’s actions were disproportional to the situation, apart from the obvious property damage offense. Furthermore, throwing snow at an employee might not count as illegal; however, it is blatantly disrespectful toward an individual. A utilitarian point of view would consider this incident wrong by examining the consequences of the offender’s actions. The seeming reason behind the offender’s behavior is the employee’s request to wear a mask, which is the state’s mandate. Utilitarianism would view the restaurant visitor’s decision to commit an offense against the employee and the restaurant’s property, starting with the consequences of these actions. Since the result is a broken glass door and an innocent employee that suffered, the consequences are harmful. As such, from the utilitarian point of view, the actions can be considered wrong. The Kantian moral theory views an issue as irrational since following the moral law and duty is rational behavior. Offering an innocent individual and damaging the restaurant’s property can be immoral. As such, dismissing the moral law renders the offender irrational in the eyes of a follower of a Kantian moral theory. I believe that utilitarianism is the most logical way to conclude this ethical problem. The reason for that is that negative consequences for anybody can be the best moral compass for almost any decision. The Kantian moral theory is based on moral law, which can be subjective in some people’s minds. As such, according to Kantian theory, some people might disagree that the incident is an ethical issue. In contrast, according to utilitarianism, a negative impact on any individual renders an action wrong.",
    "The primary source for this study is the general medical journal The Lancet. It publishes the survey data and provides statistics and a comparative analysis of the obtained quantitative information. The Economist can be seen as a secondary source that describes research with less digital content. The study represents a decrease in the HIV infection rate of girls in school by stabilizing their families’ financial difficulties. The World Bank funded the study to demonstrate the value of money in reducing the spread of HIV among young, poor girls. The study was authored by Berk Özler, Lead Economist and Poverty Research Manager. The medical journal The Lancet presented statistics based on a survey in the Zomba district of Malawi (G.C. 2). The Economist later summarized the study with the most critical findings from the analysis. Thus, 1,300 unmarried girls aged 13 to 22 took part in the study. This is a sufficient number of subjects to consider the prevalence of HIV in poor areas. The sampling took place with the help of a computer, so the girls fell into different experimental groups randomly. Thus, a group stood out in which girls and their families were given small amounts of money every month, girls paid to attend school, and girls left without financial support. Based on the study, it can be concluded that the subjects who received the money in both groups showed a significant reduction in the spread of the virus. However, test subjects with no money were forced to look for a sugar daddy. Therefore, in this group of issues, the statistics of the spread of HIV were preserved. Thus, the drug called money is adequate and affects the spread of STDs. The implication is that the global community needs funding to stop the spread of HIV. However, research and further assistance to young girls have several limitations. Firstly, it is hard to understand how much money each person needs to stop looking for sugar daddies and move on with their lives. Moreover, the study was conducted over 18 months, so it is impossible to assess how it will work in the long term",
    "Horror films have become one of the fundamental genres of cinema, the popularity of which is not inferior to the other styles. The reason for it is the specific reaction of the target audience, namely a powerful emotional impulse. Moreover, it becomes a psychological relief for some persons, which helps to distract from one’s problems. Horror films are not the modern version of public lynching; they formulate a way for people to obtain a strong emotional response through fear. Fear is a primary human emotion, which manifests itself as an instinct for self-preservation, namely a reaction to a potential threat. It may seem strange for one that people pay money to feel such an unpleasant emotion while watching horror films. However, in the essay Why We Crave Horror Movies , Stephen King argued that people aim to re-establish their feelings of essential normality (King, 1). In other words, one tries to reset their ordinary feelings for many reasons. Some are distracting from problems in this way, others get a dose of adrenaline, and sometimes horror films become a way to throw out their emotions in a movie theater and not on other people. Any art must evoke emotion and promote the individual experiencing ethical pleasure. Watching horror movies seems to have nothing to do with the ethical aspect. However, the success of horror movies, to more extent than other genres, depends on the audience’s reaction (Glasby, 7). The strong reaction makes horror films stand out in terms of the criteria for assessing art. Indeed, few people can lag behind absolutely indifferent when watching scary scenes. Besides, the powerful emotional response makes horror films so popular and successful nowadays. To conclude, one identified that horror films do not formulate a form of modern public lynching. They are the one’s method to receive the bright, emotive response. There are various reasons for it, beginning from obtaining psychological discharge and ending to distracting from reality and one’s urgent problems. The audience’s reaction is the key point to evaluating the horror film’s success and why it is considered art.",
    "A mutation is a change in the genome of an organism. Most commonly, mutations are defined as changes in DNA structure that occur due to disruption of the sequence of genes or the emergence of new genes. In this paper, I would like to talk about spontaneous mutations. Spontaneous mutations occur by chance – for example if a sheep is suddenly born in a flock of sheep with shorter legs; such mutations can also occur in humans. The ADRB1 gene, for example, is responsible for regulating the amount of sleep a person needs each night to function properly. Most humans need eight hours of sleep or more, but about 5% of the population enjoys a slightly different mutant version. Tests done on a mother and daughter who had the mutation revealed the ability to sleep only 4 to 6 hours each night (Servick, 2019). This mutation refers to a type of genomic mutation. The protein encoded by the mutation is a receptor for norepinephrine. This mutation is dominant, autosomal, and beneficial in its effect on the viability of individuals. Changes in the ADRB1 gene occur primarily in humans. However, they can also be in animals, although no studies have yet been conducted. Such a mutation does not affect the human population in the general world. This is mainly due to the fact that it is not dangerous and is not life-threatening to its carriers. Thus, such a mutation is only a positive addition to the life abilities of a human carrier. This mutation is sporadic and is not a dominant trend in population genome changes despite its dominance. I find this example interesting because natural changes in the human genome open up new possibilities for the population. Thus, studying such changes is essential for human development and a deeper study of human capabilities.",
    "In his graphic novel, Spiegelman uses a literary device known as anthropomorphism to show the difference between races, including Americans, the Germans, and the Jews. This device makes the severe issue seem simpler to understand, and the readers pay more attention to the ideas expressed by the author. In Maus , Spiegelman portrays the horrors of the holocaust and reminds the readers that the holocaust’s victims and survivors also had their own lives and dreams. The first section to be discussed is Chapter 1 – “The Sheik.” In this section, the main character Artie asks his father Vladek to tell him about his life during the war. Instead of describing the horrors Vladek faced during the holocaust, he prefers to tell his son about his happy and careless life in 1935 (Spiegelman, 1980, pp. 13-23). This desire to recall the good old days proves that the victims of the war prefer to remember the pleasant times. The second section is Chapter 3- “Prisoner of War.” In this part of the novel, Vladek talks about the first events he witnessed as a soldier. Interestingly, Vladek remembers the name of a soldier he killed, and this detail shows that even during the terrible events, one’s brain catches the small and unmeaningful things (Spiegelman, 1980, p. 50). Finally, Vladek says that he was reunited with his family, and this event matters more than what he experienced as a prisoner of war. The third part to analyze is Chapter 5 – “Mouse Holes.” This section shows that, for many mice, war is a series of difficult decisions that must be made in order for them to try to survive (Spiegelman, 1980). Even when parents learn about the death of their children, they need to keep a cold mind so as not to get caught by the cats. To draw a conclusion, one may say that this graphic novel is a unique literary work about World War II. In these comic drawings, Spiegelman managed to portray the horrors of the holocaust and those little but meaningful things that supported the victims and helped some of them to remain hopeful. Despite the fact that the war was full of violence and murders, the author shows the irony of the situation – the Germans are just animals who imagine they are better than others.",
    "The creation of a web-based system to store the university’s information on students and their transcripts presents certain risks that need to be addressed in the feasibility report. Using the standard risk evaluation process, it is possible to differentiate the risks into two large groups. These are risks to the continuation and completion of the project and risks to the end product’s performance after the project has been completed. The risks to the continuation and completion of the project are as follows:   * Unforeseen delays and time expenditures. It is possible that the project’s implementation will be more complex than anticipated, requiring more time;   * Individuals participating in the project might become sick and slow down production;   * The available hardware and software may malfunction. The risks for the performance of the end product are as follows:   * The product might not be secure enough to be allowed to work with personal student data;   * The product would be economically unfeasible to run;   * The product would not perform adequately to the university’s requirements. Time-related problems could be identified by comparing the progress made with the timeline developed before starting the project. Functionality and requirements risks can be discovered by matching the product against its requirements for it, as well as through testing during specific project milestones. Potential time constraints and personnel/hardware breakages can be accounted for by allocating more time to the project than initially estimated to allow for replacements to be made. Countering the risks associated with site performance would be more difficult and largely have a reactionary nature, should some of them not be discovered and remedied during the product testing phase.",
    "The computation of the three ratios Return on Assets (RoA) Return on Equity (RoE) Profit Margin The purpose and information conveyed by each ratios The three ratios presented and computed in the previous section represent vital profit generation indicators for a modern commercial organization. The return on assets (RoA) shows how well the company utilizes the entirety of its assets, including the borrowed ones, to generate financial returns. The return on equity is largely similar to this metric, but it does not consider the debt of the company (Gallo, 2016). Finally, the profit margin is one of the most important indicators of financial health, as it draws a direct comparison between sales and profits, showing how much the company actually earns from its operations. ABC Company review on three ratios First of all, the ABC Company’s business model can be deemed successful, as it generates adequate profits. Optimal returns on equity and assets show that the investors can reasonably expect returns on their participation in the company’s financing. The profit margin is also considerable, which means that this aspect of the firm is handled well. The profitability of the company Overall, the ABC Company remains a profitable enterprise that successfully converts its assets into revenues. The profit margin is over 50%, which is commendable, even though the overall turnover is below $1 million. Therefore, the business model on its own functions well, allowing the ABC Company to retain a stable position on the market. However, it may not suffice for the sustained growth in the long-term. ABC Company financial successful While the ABC Company’s financial statement may present positive indicators, it would be unwise to consider the company in isolation. Instead, it appears to interesting to compare the entity’s performance against the industry’s leaders to identify the areas in which it excels or where the improvements are needed. First of all, the return on assets is provided by Rose (2022), indicating that the industry’s average was set at 9.1-9.3% across the past four years. The ABC Company’s figures are considerably higher at the moment with 28.3%, but it is important to note that its absolute cash flows are not on par with the industry’s leaders. Thus, it is possible that the ABC Company’s ratios will become lower as the entity continues to grow. This difference becomes particularly evident when the income levels are compared with the industry’s average figures. As far as net income is concerned, the industry has averaged at $4.7 million in 2020. The ABC Company is far from this level, as its net income is only $77,000, which implies that it still has a long growth phase ahead. Furthermore, the industry’s leaders, such as Williams-Sonoma, have hundreds of millions of sales, whereas the ABC Company only has half-a-million. As the total assets of the company increase, there is no guarantee that its profit margins and returns on investment will remain equally high. Under these circumstances, the emphasis will be on maintaining the profitability of operations above the average level across the industry.",
    "Portraying the lives of gods and depicting relationships between them, as well as their interactions with humans, both “Iliad” and “Metamorphosis” elaborate on the theme of power abuse by those at the helm. In “Iliad,” Agamemnon has to face retribution due to his constant abuse of power: “be ready, that I be not left,/Alone of all the Greeks, without my prize” (Homer, 762 B. C.). Likewise, in “Metamorphosis,” various deities display complete disrespect for those of lesser power: “What had escaped the waves, now feared the flame” (Ovid, 8 B.C.). However, unlike the “Iliad,” “Metamorphosis” rarely demonstrates the comeuppance that deities have to face for their negligence of mortals’ needs (Homer, 762 B. C.; Ovid, 8 B. C.). Therefore, while thematically similar, “Iliad” and “Metamorphosis” represent slightly different perspectives on the problem o power abuse. The theme of mortals’ protection, which is central both to “Iliad” and “Metamorphosis,” remains essential nowadays as well. Namely, a range of contemporary leaders appear to have tremendous amounts of power due to their political influence, their economic one, or a combination of both (Homer, 762 B. C.; Ovid, 8 B. C.). For instance, the disregard for human rights in countries such as China, where leaders attain the status of god-like creatures, can be seen as similar to the one in the “Iliad” and “Metamorphosis.” However, what makes “Metamorphosis” slightly less effective in this regard is the comedic manner in which it portrays the abuse of mortals. In turn, “Iliad,” being a more serious work, produces a much greater impact by condemning the violence of omnipotent gods toward humans, which is more in line with the current concept of power abuse. Nevertheless, both the “Iliad” and “Metamorphosis” carry an important message and a deep meaning. Providing an insight into power dynamics within Ancient Greek society, they also help recognize similar patterns in the modern community.",
    "The article of Zulaika (2022) presents the impact of COVID-19 lockdowns on adolescent pregnancy and school dropout among secondary school girls in Kenya. The cases of teenage pregnancy started in Kenya after the country-wide school closure that started from March 2020 and lasted until January 2021. Zulaika (2022) examine to what extent the pandemic affected sexual and reproductive health of adolescents in Rarieda subcounty. The study shows there was a limited involvement of health administrators on the issue of pregnancy among school girls. Teenagers lack sexual education and are not aware of different methods of protection. Health administrators should find this issue important as early pregnancy can be dangerous for girls’ health and lead to various socio-economic problems in the future. Moreover, if such a rate of adolescent pregnancy continues to increase, there would be less educated females in Kenya. Zulaika (2022) also mentions that stress level of pregnant teenagers is high, affecting mental as well as physical health of young future mothers. To tackle this issue, Zulaika (2022) suggests implementing population-level emergencies on girls that are going to school. Students should be educated for the basics of sexual education and for the side effects of sexual life. Furthermore, the article points out that infectious diseases can be spread rapidly if school girls do not know the importance of contraceptives. As such, there is a need to the national project of informing school students and their parents about sexual and reproductive issues. The effects of COVID-19 on teenage pregnancy are negative, causing additional social and economic problems not only for the pregnant girls and their families but also for the whole country.",
    "Primarily, one should note that the country that I chose to perform the assignment is France. Undoubtedly, there are many consulates of France in the United States. However, to take the remains to the “homeland,” it is required to contact a special consulate general located in California, Los Angeles. In this context, a “mourner” should arrange a meeting in the office with a specialist two days in advance to discuss all the details and points regarding the dispatch of human remains and sealing an urn ( Shipment of cremated remains , 2019). Thus, the Consulate General of France in Los Angeles is one of the most relevant places to ask for help to remove “remnants.” Accordingly, I have to provide the following merchandise to the family in the future. First of all, it is necessary to prepare a package of particular documents. For instance, they include a death certificate of a loved one in the US, a medical report, and a certificate of cremation and sealing. Moreover, an attestation of the absence of extraneous attachments and closed sealing of the urn, a certificate of the lack of infectious diseases from the deceased, and a permit to import remains will be required. It is also essential to have a person’s permission to request repatriation and a certified French translation of the death and cremation certificate. Secondly, this family needs an urn with the ashes of the dead, located in a special airtight container. Moreover, there are not too complicated requirements regarding the transportation of the urn in France. A person must apply directly to the French consulate in the US and prepare a package of documents set out above. There are several airlines engaged in the transportation of ashes, one of the most reliable and well-known is Air France-KLM. In most cases, the tame frames are based on an agreement between funeral companies in America and the destination country. The consulate member I have had to communicate with is Julie Duhaut-Bedos. In addition, the flight booking service would be accompanied by the consulate’s help. Depending on the distance, it is necessary to book a direct flight or with a transfer. Furthermore, each airline offers individual conditions for the transportation of special cargo. The urn with the ashes of a loved one would be carefully sealed and placed in a special lockable box with dense walls. Transporting the loved one by plane is possible only in the luggage compartment.",
    "Amazon has grown to become one of the most important companies in the US. Millions of people rely on the highly efficient deliveries and cheap prices. Moreover, the company has turned into one of the largest employees, as numerous Amazon fulfillment centers are scattered across the country. With such scale, a wide range of issues inevitably arise. Recently the multiple complaints concerning the way Amazon treats it workers have managed to draw public attention. Therefore, a dedicate analysis is need in order to understand what kind of working conditions and atmosphere the IT giant provides. Key Problems: Job Dissatisfaction and High Turnover Rates Guaranteeing $15 an hour may be a nice incentive for people in poor neighborhoods, but only in the short run. Motivating people to work better by gradually increasing their pay would be not only more appealing and psychologically comfortable, but also highly beneficial in the long run. Task assignments and worker motivation interact through the extent of labor market competition – that is, the possibility of moving to another firm (Bar-Isaac & Levy, 2022). Therefore, Amazon should consider applying a more traditional approach to motivating workers, which will help to reduce current turnover rates. Cause: Poor Motivation Techniques E-commerce is no longer as lucrative as it used to be a decade ago. It has become the primary way people do shopping, especially in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic. Therefore, numerous new companies have jumped at the opportunity and managed to extend their market shares. Thus, Amazon is determined to cut costs substantially by various means, including the construction of its fulfillment centres in the neighborhoods that have not fully recovered from recent economic recessions. According to Kinicki (2020), turnover is one of the major outcomes that should be considered while tailoring the set of inputs. Currently, the company’s turnover rate continues to be extremely high. Desired Solution: Utilizing More Conservative Motivation Frameworks The emphasis on fear, the discouragement of camaraderie and many other Amazon’s current policies substantially undermine employee’s motivation and the company’s public image. The desired potential solution plan includes the introduction of systematic pay raises, the enhancement of bonus systems and changing the way employees are timed. These steps will help the IT giant to motivate employees in a much more positive and respectful way.",
    "American slavery arose as a way of exploiting labor within capitalism but gradually took shape in an autonomous socio-economic and political structure. Over time, a liberation movement began, which implied the illegality and unethical “ownership” of people. However, even after official emancipation, the slaves were dependent on the state and slave owners in the past, with a lack of resources for subsistence. Without documents, financial resources, and moral support, it was difficult for new members of society to integrate into a standard life. Additionally, discrimination and lack of inclusion as a phenomenon continued to exist. Slavery was abolished as a result of the Civil War between the northern and southern states. The passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to the US Constitution in January 1865 brought a permanent end to slavery in the US, making it illegal and anti-constitutional. Currently, this phenomenon in the United States is considered one of the most shameful episodes in the history of the country. At the same time, an urgent question arises whether the state should have compensated the slaves for the material and spiritual damage that was caused to them in the process. Even if slave labor is not officially permitted and the slaves are freed, without the provision of basic resources for life, survival is unlikely. The concept and attitude of society also affect the acceptance rate of new members. In the case of unequal chances of receiving the same benefits, the slaves in the past have more difficulties, challenges, and complexities on the path of integration. In this regard, the new slaves were not truly emancipated, as they were still dependent on a source of resources for subsistence.",
    "The present essay analyzes a manual for the use of a dishwasher developed by Bosch. The first positive characteristic of this manual is that it contains a lot of illustrations that make it easier to understand how to use the dishwasher. For instance, the manual depicts how to add rinse aid, arrange crockery in the dishwasher, and remove baskets (Bosch, n.d.). Thus, the manual is focused on its audience, who is not expected to know very well how to use the dishwasher. Besides, the section on the installation of the machine is not detailed and contains only fundamental suggestions. Hence, the authors of the manual expect it to be installed by professionals. Another reason that proves that this manual focuses on the audience is that the largest part of the text is presented in the form of bullet points. Therefore, a user could easily and quickly find all necessary information in the manual. The manual is problem-oriented, purposeful, and persuasive because it addresses precise issues that users might face. For example, it explains how to select the right program for specific types of crockery and food remains, cancel and stop the program, and check the condition of the machine. Even though the text is written without technical terminology, the manual remains professional. This conclusion is based on the fact that in the instruction, one could find answers to a wide range of specific questions. The manual contains instructions on how to use the dishwasher, take care of it, install, dispose of wastes, and what to do in case of a failure. As it has already been mentioned, the examined manual is designed-centered. It contains numerous illustrations, schemes, and bullet points that make it easy to read. What is more, near the paragraphs with warnings, a related sign is inserted. The exclamation point in a red triangle draws the attention of a reader and makes him or her focus on the content of the section. The manual is also logical: the first section is dedicated to the components of the dishwasher; in the second one, the manual tells the audience how to put tableware in it. Afterward, there is information on how to add water softener, salt, and rinse aid. Finally, the manual explains how to take care of the device and how to act in case of a problem.",
    "Referring to competition’s nature, the competitive landscape covers multiple aspects, including, the number and size of companies, their weaknesses and strengths, barriers to the market entry and exit, and substitutes’ threats. In the present day, it substantially differs from the traditional competitive environment that relied on large advertising budgets and economies of scale – and it continues to transform due to rapid technological progress. Due to constantly changing conditions, the contemporary competitive mindset is characterized by innovation, integration, flexibility, and speed. It relies on data in business decision-making in order to have competitive advantages and create transparent business processes, adapts to the latest market technologies, and aims to improve the consumer experience. In general, in order to stay competitive, the majority of companies focus on customer-oriented operations to meet people’s demands and strengthen brand awareness and loyalty. There are several drivers of the current competitive landscape, including new business models, consumer protection, price transparency, hypercompetition, and environmental awareness, however, the primary ones are flexibility and technologies. In other words, companies cannot implement only one strategy for stable growth and development and should use all technological advantages to outperform competitors. Thus, those companies that are flexible, apply various approaches, and see opportunities may succeed even in tough economic conditions. For instance, NVIDIA, a multinational technology company that designs graphics processing and chip units for professional markets, gaming, and mobile computing, performs excellently regardless of the COVID-19 recession. The company has taken advantage of a global lockdown and people’s self-isolation focusing on remote computing services and video gaming. For instance, approximately seven million Nintendo gaming consoles with NVIDIA’s chips were sold in the third quarter of 2020 (Fitch, 2020). This case demonstrates that in the current competitive landscape, those companies who may rapidly adapt to any conditions will be able to stay productive and highly demanded.",
    "Guaman Poma witnessed the injustices of the colonial government and personally suffered by its hands. He was the descendant of Incan noblemen who grew up after the conquest of Peru by the Spanish. His family was stripped of their lands and titles, and his attempts to regain them were continuously rebuffed by the colonial government (Kilroy-Ewbank, n.d.). Although he initially worked with the colonialists, Poma was exiled for supposedly false claims of nobility and then decided to publicly denounce the Spanish treatment of natives. He published a 1200-page illustrated document addressed to the Spanish king, chronicling the Andean way of life before invasion and the abuses they had suffered since under the Conquistadors. Poma’s manuscript illustrates the full horrors of colonialism and argues that the Spanish were foreign settlers who had no right to take control of the land God had given to Peruvians. He proposes a system of political organization wherein the government is representative of its people and adapted to their practical needs (Kilroy-Ewbank, n.d.). Poma has thus made a significant contribution to the discussions of liberty, political representation, social responsibility, and self-determinacy of individual states. His notion that the government should be created for and by the people that have historically occupied the land it rules over is strikingly modern. Furthermore, Poma’s work completely refutes the idea that Europeans brought civilization and political organization to the Incas. This interpretation is revealed as only a hypocritical pretense to justify violence, economic exploitation, and cultural erasure as a means of political control. It portrays how an entire way of life was completely destroyed and lost as its people were deprived of their freedom and forced to assimilate. Although Poma admires the moral standards the Spanish purport to uphold, he shows that they have not actually measured up to them.",
    "Background The action of the prayer effect is based on the regularities and peculiarities of cognitive processes. It is based on two attention abilities, namely, switching and concentration. In the course of prayer, people switch and focus on an area of higher spirituality. The requirement of regularity and systematic recitation of worship leads to frequent repetition of concentration on religious categories, strengthening the mental connection with God. Froese and Jones (2021) wrote in their article that prayer strengthens one’s faith in the supernatural and, therefore, it is a session of faith. In addition, public prayer has long been used as a tool to influence the political arena (Froese & Jones, 2021). Therefore, one can consider this phenomenon as a weapon, sacred and supernatural. The same idea that prayer is a weapon, and used politically, is also found in Martin’s article. Religion is familiar with precedents when it was possible to defeat enemy troops by force of turning to God (Martin, 2019). For example, in A.D. 174, by the power of prayer, a Roman legion was able to discover a spring of water, and the flood that followed washed away the enemies (Martin, 2019). In general, both authors emphasize that prayers serve as weapons and that their use brings people closer to God. Participants in the ritual often experience a sense of social acceptance and emotional uplift after the prayer is completed. The rhythmic and systematic repetition of prayers reinforces the ideals and guidelines of a particular religion (Froese & Jones, 2021). Martin also wrote about it in his article, he came to the conclusion that these circumstances determine why prayer can be used as an epiphany strategy. Proactivity manifests itself as a response to a stimulus; a prayer of this type responds to a vision for fate. Due to such rituals, it is possible to create the future by praying (Froese & Jones, 2021). People often asked God to protect them in battle throughout early Christian history. Prayers were used to ease the fear of the Israelites, strengthening their resolve long before Jesus was born (Martin, 2019). The initiators of such prayers were used to reassure soldiers before skirmishes. It was assured that they would be guaranteed a place in heaven if they won (Martin, 2019). Both authors mention that requests for intervention in this way have existed throughout Christian history. They are unanimously convinced that prayers are inherently proactive; there are no significant differences between their positions. Summary Repentance In his second letter to the Corinthians, Paul refers to repentance as sorrow for God’s sake, which leads to salvation (2 Corinthians 7:10). Repentance in Paul’s understanding is when one does not return to sin again. Repentance cleanses the soul, and a clean soul, in turn, is able to more fully receive the grace of the Holy Spirit.

    "Supporters of relativism believe that morality in the objective sense does not exist. The moral norms adopted in society are not obligatory for adherence and execution. In absolute terms, the concepts of evil and good are nothing more than fiction. In this regard, researcher Porus noted that moral relativism could easily degenerate into permissiveness (Bush and Moss, 2020). Moreover, people who adhere to this point of view can be perceived as the ones trying to devalue moral norms to the lowest possible level, will not attempt to seek compromises and negotiate on mutually beneficial terms. On the contrary, objectivism states that there is right and wrong that do not depend on someone’s opinions or other factors. In this sense, moral standards are believed to be propounded and everlasting, not created by humans. There are many philosophical variations and interpretations of objectivism, but the key idea lies in proclaiming one genuine truth. This evidently opposes the concept of relativism in every aspect (Bush and Moss, 2020). Objectivism, however, admits that some moral norms may change, but at thy core, any rules and standards evolve around an unaltered understanding of bad and good. I find relativism more convincing despite some flaws it contains. Although absolute relativity often signals the absence of a moral and ethical core and is thus unreliable, the theory of relativism has more realistic features. Every day we face elections, the result of which often cannot be called correct or not. Most people, in principle, always try to act ethically, but even then, their actions can be perceived negatively. You will not please everyone precisely because, despite some existing ideas about good and evil, you make decisions that pass through the prism of experience, psychological characteristics of a person, circumstances, and weighing many factors. I find objectivism too utopian an ultimatum, which seeks to simplify morality while threatening it with a distorted view of reality.",
    "Cryptocurrencies are a controversial topic in society, as their volatility puts their long-term validity into question. However, older blockchain coins have failed to deliver a scalable and secure currency that will be as decentralized as possible (Hamilton, 2022). Unlike Bitcoin and Etherium, Solana has multiple advantages that make it a worthwhile investment. For this proposal, I would like to highlight the benefits of this cryptocurrency to a business university graduate. Solana is not the newest cryptocurrency, yet it is one with the highest potential. Other blockchains possess a small capacity for transactions, as their operations per second make them unfeasible (Locke, 2021). However, this currency transfers faster and has incomparably small transaction fees (Farrington, 2021). An investment in Solana is a safer choice among cryptocurrencies, yet it has the potential to multiply one’s savings. Safety and speed of transactions are the reasons behind the high chances for future widespread usage of Solana (Hamilton, 2022). My proposed idea is to capitalize on Solana’s recent success on the market, as this currency was up 12000% in the past year (Locke, 2021). I think that this subject deserves more attention, as cryptocurrencies provide a unique take on financial interactions, yet their current state disallows companies to utilize them efficiently. Solana has the potential to overcome these barriers and turn into a globally accepted currency. In conclusion, Solana is a cryptocurrency that is worth one’s attention, as it has several benefits that make it a better choice for investment than other similar coins. Its current solid position on the market and strong backing from a cryptocurrency community is a perfect indication of future prospects. It might be necessary to analyze Solana’s carbon footprint to prove its potential for a long-term success.",
    "Yoga is a concept that signifies a set of spiritual, mental, and physical practices aimed at managing the cognitive and physiological functions of the body. Practicing this sport allows one to broaden the horizons, change the habitual way of life, and eliminate harmful patterns that negate the efforts. That is why yoga is considered the most effective practice of self-development that has unique benefits for health, both physical and psychological. There are numerous varieties of modern yoga; despite the dissimilarities, they are grounded on shared parts: body postures, breathing exercises, and spiritual contemplation. The combination of exercises that train the body and soul has unique health benefits. It strengthens muscles, increases flexibility, and enhances mental soundness. Moreover, yoga classes have enormous therapeutic potential and preventive effects. Studies involving patients with various musculoskeletal conditions have indicated that yoga helps to reduce pain and improve joint mobility (Saeed et al., 2019). Breathing exercises relax the muscles that constrict the airways and strengthen oxygen diffusion, leading to better lung function. One of the chief yoga concepts is the “eight limbs,” which consists of alternating stages for achieving a state of enlightenment. Eight steps are a prerequisite for everyone to feel connected to the world. Through these practices, one learns to control one’s actions, accept all hardships calmly, and find compromises. The ultimate goal of the methodology is to learn to find a balance between one’s own and the world’s values and understand that each person has an essential mission in the community. It significantly affects an individual’s social well-being as it seeks to bring body, mind, and soul into unison (Saeed et al., 2019). The balance of these essential elements ensures a healthy and harmonious personality, activates energy potential, and prevents psychological stress. In conclusion, yoga is essential for promoting health and combating social isolation and depression. It can be used for physical development, healing, and emotional restoration. Yoga is based on a holistic approach that helps the whole body return to a normal state. It makes it an indispensable and beneficial self-development practice for the health of both adults and children.",
    "Theodor Adorno’s concept of industrial culture implied a strong connection between capitalist society and the products capitalism produces in the cultural sphere to enhance the existing social practices that benefit the further development of capitalism. Therefore, Adorno suggested that most media products, such as films, books, television programs, reinforce the population’s belief in capitalist values. On the other hand, the structural functionalism theory approaches society as a living organism, where each part of society plays its function in the viability maintenance of the whole organism. Therefore, even though the concepts have similarities in equally prioritizing the importance of stability in society, their differences can be more apparent through application to modern culture and society. In his theory, Adorno pointed at the obvious narrative of mass media products, such as films and books, where wealth is often associated with happiness. However, another example with a more apparent connection to reinforcing capitalism is entertainment for children. From a very young age, modern children are exposed to different sorts of media in the form of tv shows, cartoons, and animated films. In the structural functionalism approach, the entertainment industry for children presents a source of education and emotional development. In different forms, the children’s entertainment industry teaches them important moral practices of being kind and polite to other people, which serves as the foundation for security in the future society. However, in the industrial culture approach, modern children’s entertainment is focused on selling the merchandise of different characters featured in films. For example, one of the most influential companies, Disney, invented the business model of using cartoon characters to attract children to their theme parks (Clement, 2018). Now, the company strategically plans simultaneous launches of animated films and merchandise with the films’ characters to ensure financial benefit.",
    "Archetypes describe such characteristics, which are universal patterns that define certain events, objects, or people. In literature, they describe representations and concepts that are common to all people, which allow people to understand and interpret stories. However, archetypes also exist in everyday life and play a significant role in shaping the perception of the world around them. In particular, there are archetypes of people that help determine their character and actions, as well as motivation. Applying this concept to everyday life, one can single out special types of people who have a set of common and exclusive characteristics for them. They are formed both on the basis of the actions and inclinations of the person and depending on the environment. An example of an archetype in everyday life is the head of a large modern corporation, such as Elon Musk. He can be defined as a hero or creator who has the inspiration and courage to change the world around him. Other people perceive it in this way, which makes it a great example of an archetype. All his actions are motivated precisely by these characteristics, and his primary motivation is the transformation of the world. The presence of archetypes in everyday life allows me to compose a more comprehensive perception of people and events. In particular, based on the characteristics I know, I can determine the motivation and role of a certain person, which makes him more predictable. This is certainly more difficult than may be presented in the literature because people often have mixed features. However, in general, the concept of archetypes gives me the opportunity to understand the actions of people and their characters. I can later use this information to form my own relationship with them.",
    "Introduction The shifts in attitudes of people towards romantic relationships and, more specifically, marriage are attributes of societal development. From this perspective, the trends common for Gen Z are incredibly informative and, therefore, used for analyzing the situation in this area (Klein, 2022). It is clear that individuals’ mindsets are formed under the influence of external circumstances, which implies the correlation of opinions about love and sex with the presence of threats to personal well-being. Hence, one cannot examine the accompanying phenomena and cause-and-effect relationships while neglecting either the human factor or the conditions of the environment. One of the articles devoted to the subject is “Are Gen Z more pragmatic about love and sex?” and its critical analysis can reveal the elements of effective writing intended for considering complex events. Summary of the Article In the selected piece, Jessica Klein narrates the tendency for representatives of Gen Z to postpone marriage and avoid long-term relationships while prioritizing personal issues. Compared to previous generations, these individuals do not view this area as a natural condition for entering adulthood due to a number of reasons. First, the advantages of single life are more attractive than settling down and help them satisfy their need for introspection (Klein, 2022). Second, people in this group adopt a pragmatic approach to the matter because they understand the necessity of gaining stability in life in order to have a family (Klein, 2022). Third, Gen Zers face more problems than their parents due to the pandemic and prefer to reflect on the kind of person they want to be partners with and choose them carefully (Klein, 2022). As a result, the processes in this area slow down significantly, and the primary focus on self, as opposed to interactions with others, justify the changes which happened to this part of human life. Response Evidence The examined article is an effective piece of writing due to the inclusion of evidence from numerous sources, both of qualitative and quantitative nature. Thus, Klein (2022) refers to multiple studies related to the subject under consideration, including surveys conducted among the target population and statistical data gathered by official institutions. More importantly, she analyzes the current tendencies in the relationships of Gen Z through the lens of the experience of previous generations (Klein, 2022). This approach to the task makes the findings more credible compared to a possible orientation on the information received from the participants and, consequently, confirms the reliability of conclusions for conducting further research. The overall extensiveness of this publication is also supported by the inclusion of personal opinions alongside the studies mentioned above (Klein, 2022). In this way, the selection of appropriate instruments for the purposes of this article is one of its main advantages. External and Internal Factors",
    "From 2016 to 2018, this study summarizes sport fisheries in the Anchorage Management Area. They contained a description and historical background of each sport fishery, as well as information on how each fishery is now managed, as well as performance and escapement data for 2016–2018. According to the report, reductions in the number and size of fish available for release in locally stocked lakes have had a detrimental impact on local fisheries’ popularity and productivity. It should be mentioned that because this source gives statistical data, it may be trusted. All of this will surely be beneficial to the study, as official data must be considered. The sport fisheries in the North Gulf Coast Management Area are discussed in this study. A summary and overview of each fishery are included, and information on how the fisheries are managed and fishery performance and escapement from 2016 to 2018. This report is provided by the official department that controls fishing activities in Alaska. However, it should be noted that this source can be considered reliable as it provides statistical information. All this will undoubtedly be useful for research since it is necessary to take into account official data. The intricacy of variables that restrict or encourage diversity in Alaskan fisheries, one of the world’s most important fishing locations, is examined in this case study. They looked at changes in participation and portfolio variety in Alaskan fisheries over three decades using a mix of harvest statistics and literature reviews. The four case studies looked at how fishers, fleets, and communities responded to various interconnected stressors, such as biological decreases, market and pricing dynamics, and fisheries privatization. Experts also verified this article, which is reflected in the reliability and accuracy of the information provided. It will be useful for research because it reflects current trends and factors affecting the spread of sport fishing.",
    "Deductive reasoning involves the construction and development of cause-and-effect solid relationships. It is noteworthy that the connection is established either between two facts or a point and the idea of how it will affect the future (Besnard & Hunter, 2018). Thus, a judgment (logical expression) includes the first – the prerequisites, the second – the conclusion. In logic, an argument is valid only when it has a form that makes it impossible for the premises to be correct and the judgment to be wrong. According to the explained three types of deductive arguments, a valid statement does not need to have actually trustworthy premises. Still, it must have ones that, if they were accurate, would guarantee that the conclusion is proper. Example:  1. All metals are heavy  2. Tin is a metal  3. Tin is heavy A sound argument must have both a valid form and true premises. Valid arguments can be unsound, but they will have wrong assumptions. Example:  1. All dogs are cats  2. All mice are dogs  3. All mice are cats What makes this a valid statement is not that it has trustworthy premises and a proper conclusion but the logical necessity of the judgment, given the two assumptions. The argument would be just as valid if the premises and conclusion were wrong. However, it is essential to determine that the purpose of argumentation is to establish the truth of a judgment. An invalid argument does not achieve this goal, so it cannot be considered sound (Besnard & Hunter, 2018). A sound argument has a valid form and true premises; thus, it cannot be invalid in all cases. If the argument is invalid, then the beliefs thoroughly do not matter, and, in fact, only the conclusion remains. Therefore, this means that there is no argument in this case, especially a sound one.",
    "Aristotle made a discovery fundamental to all logic by introducing variables. Thus, it was shown that logic is not just a specific doctrine of specific things or terms, but the science of the laws of syllogisms, such as modus ponens or modus tollens, expressed in variables. Studying various judgments, formal logic abstracts from their specific content, revealing a structure common to objects of different content. Syllogism is the discovery of Aristotle and is the main and most original part of his logic. In the theory of syllogisms, Aristotle defined syllogism and distinguished its types, defined working and non-working types of syllogisms, and established three figures of syllogism. I find it particularly interesting that Aristotle was the first to make reasoning methods the subject of scientific research. He introduced the methods of reasoning as integral formations and not just certain reasoning components. Everything that was done in logic before Aristotle just attempted to understand individual methods and principles without any systematization and unification into a single coherent system. Thus, such concepts as Modus ponens and Modus tollens laid the foundation for understanding the definition of the truth of thinking. Thus, I am amazed at how accurately Aristotle introduced the concepts of conclusions that approach science by the rules of inference, the laws of contradiction, and the exclusion of the third. Modern logic as an independent field of knowledge arose from such different sciences as philosophy and mathematics. Being indeed a highly advanced concept, modern logic, however, lacks some characteristic philosophical features – it is more straightforward and technical. Modern logic is often called mathematical logic, thereby emphasizing the originality of its new methods compared to those used previously. In this sense, it is of less interest for discussion because it relies on exact sciences and computer technologists and avoids ambiguity. Thus, modern logic is built on artificial language and intelligence, which in itself is rather boring compared to traditional concepts.",
    "Using innovative technologies, ADNOC is planning to apply its electronic developments in all spheres of activity and production as early as next year. An equally noteworthy example of the diversity and multifunctionality of the use of artificial intelligence is the predictive ability of computer programs. The company is developing a computer capable of processing an impressive amount of large data and suggesting strategies for the company’s actions depending on the forecast. The developers of software for ADNOC strive to build a machine that would work according to a certain theory but would be able to offer the possibility of effective data reading. That is why, within the framework of the company, a powerful program was developed not only for material processing but also for its visualization. By using more accessible visual media to convey complex information, the development makes the future and present of the company more clearly visible and intelligible. The use of computer technologies in the development of a large company is noticeable at all levels of its existence. ADNOC uses computer simulations to improve the operation of the network chain and visualize data for a clearer picture of the company’s position. All these developments are implemented in each of the branches of the company’s operation, increasing the speed of performance and the effectiveness of actions that are more beneficial. Their project to computerize and update all sorts of areas of the company’s activities should be fully implemented in 2022 (ADNOC, 2020). This underlines the firm’s commitment to anticipating and adapting to the future. The company strives to develop a forecasting model that would include the largest possible amount of statistical data. The results of big data processing show that ADNOC has significantly accelerated the speed and the number of financial transactions through its software. Based on the logic of increasing the turnover of money, one can conclude that this software improves the financial performance of the company. In addition, it should be noted that as part of the accelerated exchange of money, an innovative blockchain technology is used, which provides a permanent digital transfer of currency. The program’s ability to make smart business decisions is already reflected in its $ 1 billion worth of stocks (Arabian Business, 2020). The varied opportunities for financial enrichment brought by this program are potentially enormous.",
    "The adversarial criminal justice system is one where the law is applied equally to all segments of the society. It is a system that presumes that one is innocent that shifts the burden of proof to the prosecution to prove beyond any shadow of a doubt. The advantage lies on the side of the defendant if there is any doubt. The accused is granted the right to silence and cannot be forced to respond to accusation levelled against them. This system poses some ethical problems because most of its procedural safeguards are always in favour of the accused. The favours that are granted to the accused include the right of appeal, the right to remain silent, the right to have an attorney, and the right to be free from unauthorized searches and arrests. The rights granted to the defendant are always a disadvantage to the prosecution which has to prove its case against the accused. This position is biased against the prosecution and makes its work even more difficult. The system encourages a scenario where both entities to a case contest with each other to win a case. This scenario makes it easier vulnerable to acts of deception and legal tactics that are questionable instead of using facts to settle cases. It is a potential ethical problem that can be solved by allowing both parties to present facts before any judgment is made to avoid injustices. If a black man is found committing a similar offence like a white woman, he is five times more likely to be arrested. It is a tendency that has been brought about by racism in the American judicial system and racial inequality in policing. Moreover, the black man is more likely to be convicted than a white woman who has committed a similar crime. According to a report by the United States Sentencing Commission, a black man who is found the same crime as the white man have a potential of receiving nearly 20% longer prison term (Ingraham, 2017). These disparities are due to cases of racism and bias found within the American criminal justice system.",
    "When learning about religions and philosophies, I find that origins or backgrounds are essential in interpreting the context and content of a religion. For Jainism, it was vital to learn that it is substantially older than a more well-known and contemporary Sikhism. Though both have close ties with Hinduism, Sihkism’s origins date back to only about 500 years ago while Jainism has a history of nearly 2500 years (Molloy 191). Sikhism exhibits a more militaristic approach to monotheism despite being more modern. As such, the Jainist belief that no Creator exists and that the universe is simply guided by natural forces becomes especially interesting as it rejects a very traditional integration of deities into theology. Following this, it is also interesting to me to observe in what ways a religion interacts with the world through its perspective. As mentioned above, Jainism rejects the belief in a Creator or God. This belief is held up by several philosophical questions that are even asked in atheistic circles. These include contradictions in typical monotheistic religions such as God being both perfect and creating an imperfect world or God loving all life but still allowing suffering. Jainism even poses a logical fallacy, which suggests that if everything in the universe had to be created, would God not also need to be created? This worldview is surprisingly modern and potentially controversial for its time. Ethics is another vital component of any philosophy or belief system. Jainism establishes five distinct principles of ethics which are Ahimsa (non-violence), Satya (truth), Astheya (non-stealing), Brahmacharya (chastity), and Aparigraha (non-possession). I am especially interested in Ahimsa which is the core of Jainist ethics. This is because I believe that many religions excuse violence due to their beliefs, which is inherently immoral to my values. Jainism proposes that non-violence is a priority and therefore inexcusable.",
    "It is important to note that it is highly common for one culture not to be able to understand the state, internal struggles, and intricacies of a different culture. The given notion is called ethnocentrism, where one’s perspective and views are centered around his or her own culture. For example, the book states: “people in America don’t understand, but when an American chain opens in a third-world country, people go crazy” (Noah 188). As a person living in Canada, I embody Canadian culture, where most people from developing nations might not fully understand that a mere fast food restaurant chain is not such a thrilling occurrence for regular consumers. The book also states that “Westerners are shocked and confused by that, but it’s a case of the West reaping what it has sown. The colonial powers carved Africa, put the black man to work, and did not properly educate him” (Noah 194). Similarly, many assume that Canadian people are excessively polite as part of the culture, but I would want others to know that it is not the case. One of the most interesting aspects of the book is how certain tyrants are not perceived as such in other places due to the lack of their relevance, which is why it is true for current leaders in Canada as well. The text states: “so in Europe and America, yes, Hitler is the Greatest Madman in History, In Africa, he’s just another strongman from history books” (Noah 196). Although Canada did not have such tyrants, many people outside Canada perceive that our leaders are perfect and representative of true democracy. However, it is not always true because they also face challenges for power struggles and do not always behave in the nation’s best interests, which are becoming more evident in recent events.",
    "Globalization is the extent to which information, investments, trade, political cooperation, cultural values, and social ideas flow among different countries. It is creating a borderless world for managers by allowing them to conduct their operations internationally rather than locally, hire employees from different countries, buy raw materials from the best sources, and sell goods in various markets (Samson et al., 2020). Although the borderless world presents many opportunities to managers, it also entails risks, such as information security and cultural differences. A global mindset is a manager’s ability to recognize and influence people or organizations that have different cultural, social, political, and psychological backgrounds (Samson et al., 2020). It has become imperative for international companies because managers constantly interact with individuals with different perspectives. To ensure effective operations and collaboration, managers should be able to understand these perspectives instead of sticking to a worldview prevalent in their home country. The international landscape is changing since China, India, and Brazil demonstrate economic growth and play an important role in global business. For example, China has received more foreign investments than any other place and has increased its number of Fortune Global 500 companies from 16 in 2005 to 98 in 2015 (Samson et al., 2020). While China is growing through manufacturing, India develops economically through services, software design, and precision engineering. A multinational corporation (MNC) is a company, with more than 25% of revenues which come from operations in countries other than the home country of the parent organization (Samson et al., 2020). MNCs are characterized by close cooperation among affiliates in different countries and a single management authority making key decisions for the parent company and all affiliates (Samson et al., 2020). Additionally, MNC managers have a global perspective, viewing the whole world as one market. Outsourcing refers to participating in a global division of labor that enables companies to complete certain activities in locations with the cheapest raw materials and labor (Samson et al., 2020). Exporting is an entry strategy in which the company’s production facilities remain in the home country, while produced goods are transferred to other countries for sale. Licensing is an entry strategy in which the company in one country gives firms in other countries access to specific resources, such as technology or trademark rights, to produce and sell its products abroad (Samson et al., 2020). Direct investing is an entry strategy where the company manages its production facilities in another country.",
    "This study’s independent variable was a helpful message on the back of the dining check regarding the upcoming specials. The dependent variable was the percentage of the bill left as a tip to the waiter. This study operationalizes the restaurant tipping culture by focusing on the tip percentage. The potential confounding variables of this experiment may be the food quality, the server’s gender, the dining party’s size, and whether the customers were regulars. The study’s strengths include design transparency, implementation simplicity, and potential replication in different settings. However, the message’s content varied depending on the special, appealing differently to customers. Furthermore, the study was conducted only in one restaurant, which renders extrapolation to different establishment classes difficult. These factors could impact the tipping outcomes and, therefore, the study results. Furthermore, it is unclear whether the mere presence of a personalized message or the message content itself drove the outcome. To evaluate this possibility, the authors could have asked waiters to write different messages, some with no useful content, such as wishing a good day or drawing a smiley face. Moreover, the researchers could have used alternative arrangements, assigning the waiters randomly instead of assigning dining parties randomly. Several aspects of this study could impact its internal validity. The researchers have instructed servers to keep their behavior consistent, thus limiting potential confounding variables. Varying attitudes may affect the final tip, thus undermining the causal relationship. Furthermore, a few hypothetical aspects could limit the research’s external validity. For instance, if the waiter were a young female adult, applying the same conclusions to male waiters and older servers would be challenging, given the potential gender factor. If the study was conducted at a private country club, extrapolating the result onto the high-class restaurant and casual diners alike would be unreliable. If the meal was buffet-style, the overall tipping percentage might have been lower due to the perceived lesser effort of a waiter, thus impacting its wider applicability. Lastly, the study only used two groups, servers, and dining parties, with no size specification. The authors could have employed a third group of solo dining parties, thus separating groups from those dining by themselves. Such an addition would allow addressing the question of the groups’ size effect and individual, interpersonal interactions. Lastly, implementing the design with solo dining parties would address the effect of gender on the outcome.",
    "As apparent from the title, the focus of the article “Positive leadership psychology: Authentic and servant leadership in higher education in Pakistan” is the Pakistani educational system, whose organization the authors analyze through the lens of leadership. Specifically, they examine the role of centralized guidance in the learning process and speculate on which style can influence its participants in the most favorable ways. In particular, the piece highlights the importance of relationships of trust in education. According to the authors, any suppressive hierarchy, strict subordination, or an atmosphere of complete obedience prevents people from openness, becoming a serious obstacle to social exchange. The latter is seen as the foundation of productive teamwork and presupposes an awareness of the other’s feelings as well as motives for searching for the most appropriate behavioral patterns. Therefore, within Bloom’s taxonomy, more precisely, its cognitive domain, the article describes the knowledge, the primary level. The publication is quite coherent and well-structured, which marks its appropriate quality. Notably, the outcomes of the analysis appear in an understandable form and actually serve to illustrate the theoretical background, in which part the authors comment on the essentiality of proper leadership in organizations. The practical part involves a detailed examination of several types and styles, specifically, the ways various leaders interact with employees. The general conclusion is the criticality of mutual respect and dedication to recognizing everybody’s needs, which underlies servant leadership as a practice. Human resources and psychology of leadership apparently are the areas where the investigators specialize. Notably, they participated in a range of publications on several topics within the above fields, such as organizational leadership, individual leadership, culture-specific peculiarities, and others. As mentioned, Current Psychology, the global peer-reviewed research forum, accepted their work for publishing, which means that it meets its quite specific quality requirements. It was found through the JFL, Jerry Falwell Library.",
    "Various cultures around the world have unique creation myths and traditional methods of presenting them through art. The cosmology of the Aztec civilization was quite different from the Europeans that conquered them. Firstly, the Europeans’ Christian God “created mankind in his own image” and granted him dominion over a perfectly constructed world, the Garden of Eden (Holy Bible, New International Version, Genesis 1:27). In the Bible, he is described as a benevolent, if strict, father figure who can forgive humankind their sins and grant them eternal redemption. Consequently, God is depicted in art as a wise, older man with a beard and white hair. Christian art primarily praises the power of His forgiveness and the bountiful nature that He created. In contrast, Aztec creation stories are based on dismembered gods, and thus the origin of the world is catastrophic violence, which explains why Aztec art depicts divinity as gruesome and awe-inspiring (National University, 2022). Their art functions as a warning and an order to obey. They demand blood in exchange for food, and each sculpture of the gods in Aztec culture contains a receptacle for human hearts (National University, 2022). Unlike Christianity, the central figure is a female goddess, but similarly to Eve, she is primarily a passive player whom the other gods punish. Furthermore, Coatlique’s choice to give birth a second time against her children’s wishes could also be interpreted as the Aztec version of Eve’s sin of disobedience. Both Aztec and Christian gods are described as perfect and self-contained. However, in the Aztec mythos, gods are above the concepts of good and evil, while in the Christian order evil is considered the dominion of Satan and the opposite of God. Therefore, Aztecs have to appease a bloodthirsty, violent goddess to receive food and survive. On the other hand, Christians have to reject sin and submit their spirit to God to gain eternal salvation. Ultimately, the Christian creation story is based on forgiveness and love compared to the Aztecs’ survival through violence, and this difference is reflected in their opposing art styles.",
    "The concept of nursing is closely associated with the idea of continuous improvement, as the trends of health care need to mirror the existing social trends to provide the best care possible. One way to secure such care is to refer to the latest scholarly findings to modify the approaches to care provision in the workplace. This process of implementing research-based findings in daily patient care is known as evidence-based practice (EBP) (Wilson & Austria, 2021). Currently, EBP is not used actively by nurses for several reasons. First, the workload of most nurses discourages their desire to learn and embrace EBP. According to McArthur et al. (2021), a physical opportunity is a construct that contributes to the nurses’ ability to resort to EBM. Physical opportunity includes such barriers as “cost and lack of resources, compromised communication, staff turnover, and limited physical guidelines” (McArthur et al., 2021, p. 20). As a result, management promotes behavioral patterns that react to the environment rather than examine it in advance. The second massive barrier to EBP in the workplace is the lack of social opportunity embodied in the lack of organizational support and teamwork (McArthur et al., 2021). Since the aforementioned examples tackle only a minor part of the existing challenged, the need to intervene and facilitate EBP is evident. The first commonly mentioned approach to facilitate the use of EBP is to establish a leadership that would encourage the practice by both setting an example and conducting training and workshops. Another crucial facilitator is to secure nurses’ access to relevant sources in the workplace, including relevant databases, steady Internet connection, and subscription to peer-reviewed publications. In such a way, the use of scholarly research will become more time-efficient and less stressful for nurses.",
    "It goes without saying that Beowulf may be regarded as one of the most prominent ancient European poems. Although its origin remains the subject of multiple discussions, the common version describes it as “a Danish poem in the Anglo-Saxon dialect” (Neidorf 847). The poem describes the glorious life and deeds of a hero, Beowulf, who was regarded as a person sent by heaven for people (Gummere line 13). Helping Hrothgar, king of the Danes, he kills the monster Grendel and his mother. Later, when he becomes the king of Danes by himself, he has to fight a dragon that terrorizes his lands. Although he follows the beast and finally slays it, Beowulf dies, being mortally wounded. From a personal perspective, this poem reflects several essential aspects of human life. The first one is the issue of identity – in Beowulf , people were entirely associated with the glory of their ancestors. They do not exist independently from their family lineage and kinship bonds. Thus, their desire of Beowulf to be recognizable and honored forces him to search for deeds and fame. Thus, another important theme of the poem is the maturity and responsibility that come with age. At the beginning of the poem, the main hero desires personal glory and has nothing to lose. However, after becoming a king, he realizes the importance of being a wise ruler who is responsible for his people’s lives. Finally, one more topic of the poem is the tension between personal value systems and the heroic code and between Christian and pagan values. It may be regarded as an example of the multifacetedness and complexity of human nature in comparison with fixed rules that frequently do not provide appropriate answers.",
    "Beowulf is an Anglo-Saxon epic poem set in Jutland before the Angles migrated to Britain. The title of this literary work is the name of the main character (Hall 2). Beowulf became one of the revered heroes in Old English literature, and the poem itself had a strong influence on pop culture. This epic character, who accepts his fate without hesitation, attracts attention in modern times full of doubts and contradictions with his almost archetypal clarity and wholeness. Indeed, for example, it can be assumed that modern superhero comics are particularly popular, partly because people still need the image of a fair, superpowered being. One of the most popular heroes of the Marvel Universe is Superman. Their similarities with Beowulf are obvious – both have incredible strength and are role models for the people of their time (Burn 107). These heroes have to overcome obstacles to help those who need support. In both universes, strength and extreme physical abilities become objects of praise and reverence. In addition, a key factor contributing to the plot of the heroes’ destinies is the presence of an enemy, on whose destruction depends the survival of the world. However, the fundamental difference is that a hero’s physical strength is not enough to admire him for modern people. This characteristic must be complemented by the purity of thought and good intentions. The hero becomes much more complex as the modern world gets more sophisticated. The fact that people still draw inspiration from old stories correlates with the tenets of postmodernist theory. According to the latter, it is necessary to constantly reproduce what has passed, make sense of it, and experiment with its content. It can be seen that stories about legendary superheroes remain relevant to contemporary viewers, readers, and audiences in general. As in Saxon times, bravery and loyalty are revered, and having these characteristics is what makes an individual a role model.",
    "There are multiple factors that stand behind the successful implementation of the P-O-L-C framework. It is important to prioritize some of them duly in case a company faces serious issues, or when the market indicates upcoming challenges. The collapse of WorldCom in 2002, that led to one of the largest accounting scandals in the US, provides a nice example of the lack of proper communication in a corporation. The inability of various top managers and accountants to communicate efficiently in order to prevent frauds is always disastrous. WorldCom grew rapidly under Bernard Ebbers who managed to jump at the multiple opportunities that the growing interest for telecom services provided at that time. Nevertheless, the company went bankrupt in a matter of a few years. Moreover, Ebbers faced several charges, including one count of conspiracy, one count of securities fraud and seven counts of filing false statements with securities regulators. The fact that the large portion of Ebber’s wealth was in WorldCom stocks, let alone several loans and loan guarantees from the company, was also scrutinized. The top managers of the company faced numerous charges and started to testify against each other. Moreover, Ebbers and his subordinates alike claimed to know nothing of the fraudulent schemes. According to Knecht (2020), up to 80% of employees generally believe that their opinions are not taken into account. Therefore, the major factor that led to the collapse of the telecom giant was the diminished quality of communication within the company. The reasons for all the misunderstanding and complicated series of negotiations between Ebbers, directors and accountants are rooted in barriers to communication that include motive distortion and extreme self-absorption. The top managers and professionals who were expected to lead the company tended to prioritize their own interests and receive only the parts of information and data that was convenient to them. Thus, the atmosphere created by such an attitude eventually led to the collapse of the corporation, as a result of the lack of decently organized teamwork.",
    "The Bhagavad Gita is an ancient Indian scripture that consists of 700 verses and is part of the larger epic Mahabharata. This book is one of the central holy scriptures of Hinduism and dates from the second half of the first millennium BC. e. The plot of the Gita unfolds within the framework of a conversation between Arjuna, the prince of the Pandavas, and Krishna, his guide, charioteer, and the supreme God incarnate. Krishna prompts Arjuna’s behavior patterns and helps to solve some moral expectations. The latter is connected with the need for the Pandavas to fight against the Kauravas. This paper aims to reflect on the Bhagavad Gita , one of the most outstanding books of the Indian epic. Arjuna exhibits characteristic traits, such as self-confidence, arrogance, pride. Arjuna demonstrates outstanding martial skills and is one of the best warriors. Krishna is the personification of the Supreme God and his traits include wisdom, humility, knowledge, and benevolence. The two characters have a close relationship: “Then, Madhava (Krishna) and the son of Pandu (Arjuna), stationed in their magnificent chariot with white horses yoked to it, loudly blew their divine conchs” (“Bhagavad Gita,” 2021, p. 13). Other characters are the Kaurava king Dhritarashtra and his adviser Sanjaya, secondary characters. The purpose of the author of the epic was to tell about the battle of Kurukshetra, where two Indian armies gathered to fight until the final victory. Arjuna asks Krishna to drive up to the center of the battlefield and finds those who will participate and those who want war – his relatives, friends, and teachers. Arjuna feels betrayed as he doesn’t want to fight and kill them. Full of doubt, he drops his bow and asks his charioteer Krishna many questions about the reasons for the war, the possibility of renouncing the battle, the correctness of his action, and ethical dilemmas. Thus, the reflection on the Bhagavad Gita, one of the most outstanding books of the Indian epic, was provided. The book is relevant, as it reveals eternal themes – morality, justice, a sense of duty, a feeling of love for one’s neighbor. The philosophical dialogue between Arjuna and Krishna touches on the most challenging ethical topics that apply to both war and peace. The characters discuss identity crisis, the purpose of life, the human self, and human temperament.",
    "The TED Talks are illustrations of bio-psycho-social-spiritual developmental issues which ultimately create circumstances in which certain people do not feel fully included in society. For example, Smith (2015) refers to the differences correlating with raising a white and a black child. Abdel-Magied (2014), on the other hand, exemplifies how a piece of clothing changes the way people treat, view, and evaluate Muslim women. It is certain that discrimination starts with bias, which is a layered concept. An article published by New York Times (2016) refers to the experiences of non-white people in the US, which often correlate with the lack of feeling of inclusion. This is also perpetrated by bias, which creates specific overviews in which people tend to favor a group of people over another one. The bias may be automatic, ambiguous, and ambivalent depending on its characteristics and how it manifests in terms of people’s opinions on certain groups of individuals (Fiske, 2022). While such incidents have never been personally experienced, it is certain that the lives of people I know have been affected in terms of self-esteem and confidence, which can often be negatively impacted because of discrimination. I would like to explore racial bias due to its relevance in today’s day and age, namely how it manifests on structural levels.",
    "The film “Coded Bias” provides comprehensive information regarding the problems related to facial recognition algorithms, determining several sources of bias. They primarily include the original orientation of creators on white faces, leading to the lack of data regarding dark complexion and the prevalence of prejudiced male developers. These conditions do not allow establishing equality in terms of race and gender and seem to present a significant threat to the field stemming from the failure to meet everyone’s needs. In addition, the lack of knowledge of how the programs process data and make conclusions does not help eliminate the risks. In turn, the possible ways of reducing this type of bias attributed to present-day facial recognition algorithms are to prevent their implementation in legal proceedings and police activity in general and introduce practical improvements. The former means accepting responsibility for decisions, and the latter suggestion is multi-faceted and should begin with updating databases to increase their variety and conducting independent assessments to confirm efficiency. By adopting these measures, bias based on race and gender can be addressed over time, and the appropriate quality of operations can be guaranteed. The mentioned ideas seem crucial for promoting proper use of technology; however, they can not only increase the precision of programs but also resolve the challenge concerning surveillance and racialized minorities. This standpoint is based on the above consideration, according to which accountability for decisions should be clearly established. This change can be performed if the algorithms work correctly, and minimizing or eliminating bias, in this case, is possible if internal and external evaluations correlate with each other. In this way, the future of this field in terms of its suitability for investigations is conditional upon the efforts of specialists in resolving the existing issues to address major concerns of Nakamura and Browne.",
    "The Caribbean history includes the ruthless colonization by Western countries like Spain. Upon colonization, the area was home to native groups such as the Ciboney or Guanahuatebey, Taino Arawak, and Carib. The colonizers brought a bunch of enslaved Africans who would work in their homes and plantations. The Whites were the minority and foreigners in the Caribbean but brutally seized and ruled against the Blacks majority. However, the Blacks maintained their identity and self-expression through various cultural activities evident to date. The Caribbean is the home for many musical genres expressing human freedom and revolution. Reggae is associated with the Caribbean people, and it is the unofficial soundtrack of many Caribbean vacations. Reggae musicians such as Bob Marley and the Wailers produced revolutionary and redemptions songs protesting against the White brutal rule in the Caribbean. Therefore, through Reggae, the Caribbean people expressed their anger against the ruthless White control. The majority African population in the Caribbean identified themselves with their cuisines and customs, including religious beliefs. The enslaved people maintained their African culinary art and cherished their cuisines. For instance, the Callaloo, the Caribbean vegetable soup, is one of the national dishes in Tobago and Trinidad. Furthermore, carnivores and parades are serious business in the area. The Caribbean parades manifest the area’s folklores and customs of African origin. The Caribbean people commemorate events in history like slavery through carnivals. The distinct African heritage in the Caribbean helped in identifying the Blacks. The Caribbean was colonized by the whites, who were the minority of the area’s population. The colonizers brought Africans who worked in their homes and plantations under the fierce rule. However, the enslaved people and the Blacks in the area expressed and identified themselves through music and distinct African heritage. Reggae songs helped the Blacks protest against the pitiless white rule, and events such as the parades and carnivals commemorated slavery. Furthermore, African cuisines such as Callaloo identified Africanism in the Caribbean. Despite the brutal rule by the White minority, the Blacks in the Caribbean expressed and identified themselves through songs and events that are evident to date.",
    "Society has always been a fundamental institution influencing the development of states. Communicating in groups, people share values, views, and responses to a particular phenomenon. Interaction in communities or clubs cultivates a public attitude to multiple events, forms a lifestyle, and influences politics. For this reason, the changes in civic life are significant for states. Putnam, in his essay “Bowling Alone,” also emphasizes this idea, saying that the social life of the USA collapses, and it is difficult to predict the results of this process. Active engagement in social processes has always been one of the major features peculiar to the country, but the situation has changed. Putnam says that “tens of millions of Americans had forsaken their parents’ habitual readiness to engage in the simplest act of citizenship” (67). It means that people have started to alter their lifestyles, shifting towards isolation and detachment, which is not typical for U.S. society. Furthermore, traditional organizations, such as clubs, are replaced by new mass membership organizations. Putnam says they have more political importance and might impact the country; however, they do not promote civic engagement. “For the vast majority of their members, the only act of membership consists in writing a check for dues or perhaps occasionally reading a newsletter” (Putnam 70). This line shows that Putnam is worried about the continuous process of disconnecting community members, who become divided and disengaged. From a long-term perspective, it might result in the collapse of civic life. The results cannot be predicted as the USA has always been a state with strong community relations. That is why Putnam says that if nothing changes, we will bowl alone, isolated from others.",
    "One of the most critical factors of breast cancer development is heredity since it causes a genetically inherent disease. If the patient’s closest relatives have been diagnosed with breast cancer, a tumor’s likelihood is high even at a young age (Coleman & Tsongalis, 2016). Since one of the patient’s close relatives had this disease, this diagnosis is indeed possible for her as well. Another significant factor in developing cancer is various diseases of the mammary glands, for example, “cystic” breasts. In the presence of such conditions, the formation of atypical cells is possible in the mammary gland (Tkaczuk et al., 2016). This can lead to their overgrowth and increase the risk of more severe diseases. The hormonal factor also has a critical influence on health. In the described case, this aspect is the most significant since it includes various details of the patient’s life. These include the first pregnancy after 30 years, not breastfeeding, and many years of taking hormonal contraceptives. This leads to the fact that the patient’s hormonal background can be disrupted (Tkaczuk et al., 2016). Therefore, with age, it becomes more difficult for the body to deal with abnormal processes. If there is an initial stage of cancer, there can be no metastasis in the patient’s organs. However, early active metastasis is characteristic of aggressive forms of cancer. There are multiple ways to determine them, and it is necessary to use some of them in any case to avoid future health problems. Histological analysis of tissue can determine the aggressiveness of the cancer type at an early stage. Breast cancer metastases detected by CT or scintigraphy indicate secondary foci in the lungs, liver, bones, and brain. It must be remembered that in breast cancer, metastases are capable of long-term existence in a latent state, even five to ten years after removal of the primary tumor.",
    "International labor laws prohibit making employment decisions regarding individuals’ age and disabilities. It means that Etihad Airways infringed on the existing regulations by introducing its approach to layoff. Considering the fact that social justice is a central demand for multinational corporations, Etihad’s conduct can be viewed as unethical and irrelevant. The more significant employee involvement in the decision-making process could have helped to avoid this situation. It directly influences performance and guarantees that fair decisions considering the workers’ input are made. Thus, Etihad attained success in compensating employees for their contribution and work. Payment processing is a critical factor influencing job security and employees’ motivation, meaning that this decision helps Etihad to generate benefits and rehire them in the future. From the case, one can also see that reduction in job security was a critical factor associated with the change process in Etihad. The decision to fire workers resulted in a lack of confidence among specialists and reduced their motivation and long-term plans in the corporation. For this reason, it is critical to secure employee positions to ensure individuals are engaged and fulfill their duties effectively. Discrimination was another factor peculiar to the change process at Etihad Airways. The corporation disregarded the corporate social responsibility issues, which resulted in the growth of dissatisfaction, lack of motivation, and engagement. It means that the company ignored possible alternatives that could have been used instead of its discriminative practices undermining job security and individuals’ readiness to work with such entities. Altogether, the case shows that lack of employee involvement was one of the fundamental issues in the case. The company’s top management made changes with minimal employee involvement. It resulted in creating an unpopular and ineffective strategy that cultivated dissatisfaction among workers. Etihad Airways ignored employees’ need for self-actualization, decreasing their motivation. The remaining workers did not feel their importance to the corporation and the power to influence its development. It demonstrates that modern workers should be provided with the chance to participate in corporate decision-making to realize their significance and become motivated. Trying to manage the wage bill, Etihad Airways accepted the wrong decision, viewing layoff as the only possible option. The choice of disability and age as criteria for decision-making infringed on the existing labor laws. Moreover, it undermined job security as employees realized their vulnerable position. Outcomes prove the low effectiveness of this strategy. Regarding the absence of available manpower, the remaining employees started to suffer from burnout because of the high level of stress. Moreover, the lack of motivation and engagement because of the processes mentioned above influenced their performance. As a result, Etihad Airways’ ability to achieve existing objectives was hindered. The case proves the critical importance of employee involvement in decision-making during the change process as it helps to motivate them and select the most acceptable options.",
    "Every business must be managed carefully, and every detail must receive a fair amount of attention. When it comes to healthcare, such facilities must require even more attention because they focus on people’s well-being. Performing such duties might be strenuous and expensive, and mentally demanding. As a Chief Nursing Officer, one will be faced with principles that include integrity maintenance, cash flow management, and employee motivation in the given circumstances. To start with, a healthcare business must always maintain its integrity. It can be evident that any business field should be focused on communication, which makes integrity a vital part (Fisher, 2008). In the given facility, the integrity maintenance principle is heavily adhered to. First of all, every doctor follows an ethical code, meaning that they know of doctor-patient confidentiality. Moreover, doctors and nurses focus on honest communication with patients. For example, in my situation, I tell patients about their actual conditions and honestly answer their questions. Another important business principle is proper cash flow management. Healthcare facility requires renovations and innovations, meaning that there will constantly be situations when new equipment or repairs will be needed (Mason et al., 2020). In this situation, it is highly necessary to implement the needed changes to not jeopardize patients’ health and well-being. For example, as a CNO, it was my obligation to manage the replacement of power generators. As a result, generators enabled the personnel to carry out their duty without problems during a storm and power outage. The last principle is the management of employees and providing them with motivation. In the case of a healthcare facility, it is essential that the employees are rewarded and their hard work is appreciated. The employees are offered extra days off and gift cards in the given facility. This can make the workers feel heard and supported. Without these steps, the nurses and doctors will have burnout and lose the desire to provide high-quality results. Thus, the given principles were chosen due to the impact they can bring on employees and patients. The mentioned principles are being used, providing good results and leading to the satisfaction of all parties. These principles are important to me since I believe that healthcare should be based on these values. Otherwise, no facility will be able to treat their patients, and there will be no trust and respect between healthcare personnel and patients.",
    "The nature of mythology and its persistence in culture throughout thousands of years has long fascinated scholars and thinkers. Joseph Campbell’s book entitled The hero with a thousand faces investigates this issue in detail to reveal how myth as a psychologically informed phenomenon predetermines cultural patterns of humanity. In this paper, the first chapter of the book, “Myth and dream,” will be at the center of the discussion. The thesis of this part might be projected through the following quote. The author states that myths “are dangerous because they threaten the fabric of the security into which we have built ourselves and our family. But they are fiendishly fascinating too, for they carry keys that open the whole realm of the desired and feared adventure of the discovery of the self” (Campbell, 2004, p. 7). Such a formulation implies that people’s minds intertwine myths and dreams as a mechanism of self-perception, understanding of the self in the context of the whole life cycle, and coping with developmental change. Myths lead people through the challenges of life and allow for integrating the conscious and subconscious into a single framework. Indeed, prior to presenting the idea in the above-mentioned quote, Campbell (2004) refers to the repetitive occurrence of the terrors and irrationalities from ancient mythology in contemporary people’s dreams. Indeed, the motifs of hatred, vanity, jealousy are intertwined with love, gratitude, and other feelings and motivations to action. In such a manner, these matters are dangerous to people because they unveil the psychological underpinnings of their subconscious in ways that contradict their rational or conscious decision-making and thinking. The author elaborates on this central idea by referring to the letters written by people about their myth-like dreams reflecting their concerns or subconscious struggles. Campbell (2004) presents an example of a young man’s dream about accidentally killing his father to obtain the full attention of his mother, which has been a recurring theme in mythology. Furthermore, the author refers to a dream of a woman who sees a half-horse-half-man individual in her dream despite any ideas of infidelity experienced consciously. In this regard, the connection between the experiences of early childhood and adulthood is essential for myths and their manifestation in dreams. This observation helps explain the second part of the quote, which states that through the contradictions of the myth-like dreams, people can understand their selves and the subconscious triggers of their emotions and behaviors.",
    "Recent fad diets have suggested that carbohydrates cause harm to one’s body. However, this statement has been refuted many times for several reasons. Firstly, to get a beautiful, efficiently functioning body, one needs nutrients – fats, proteins, carbohydrates, and water (Nazario). Carbohydrate metabolism converts carbs into vital energy for the nervous system and brain, as well as for the possibility of proper metabolism of proteins and fats. Once these elements are eliminated, there is a high risk of developing continuous fatigue, which potentially leads to depressive mood. Secondly, giving up carbohydrates leads to extra pounds because after completing a carb-free diet, the body is susceptible to every gram of carbohydrates, and super-compensation occurs in the diet. In addition to an increased appetite for carbohydrate-containing foods, the assimilation of this element increases significantly (Nazario). For example, a person was on such a diet for a month and lost ten pounds, and then immediately returned to a regular diet, regaining the same weight within a week. Thirdly, even after the first day of giving up carbohydrates, a person may feel a slight malaise and headache (Nazario). Later, there is a chance of developing constant headaches leading to migraine. Ultimately, carbohydrates are the primary source of energy for the brain. All cognitive functions slowly fade away when the main “engine” ceases to receive sufficient charge. Almost every activity demands increased brain activity which is stimulated by carbs (Nazario). When a person does not consume them, primarily the level of concentration reduces. Constant burning of ketones instead of glucose can lead to impaired brain function. Therefore, it is vital to include carbs into one’s ration in order to ensure that all bodily systems function properly.",
    "Cost of Advanced Documentation System The Advanced Documentation System is a document technology partner that helps optimize and ameliorate the work of the company’s printers. The costs spent on printers and their supply grow exponentially within years. There are various ways to improve the way printers are handled by implementing helpful services such as the Advanced Documentation System. The cost of the system depends on the brand, for instance on Capterra, the service costs $25 per month with a minimum of 5 working places which is $125 in total (Capterra, 2022). The software has a free trial period that allows the customer to understand the features of the system and its working specialties. The usage of the system can become profitable for the company within time. It is a cost-saving service as it analyzes and teaches the personnel to use various printer regimes for various needs. The software teaches the customer to use the printer on a higher level and consequently leads to better document management including converting papers to digital and re-engineering procedures for better productivity. The service successfully integrates into the IT environment of the firm and optimizes the inner work processes. Eventually, the implementation of the Advanced Documentation System can become an investment within time as it can save the time of the personnel, increase their productivity, and help the environment (Advanced Document Systems, 2022). The environmental-friendly approach is based on saving the print and the time printers are used by the personnel. Alternative Funding Sources The company can pay for the service using various financial resources for alternative funding resources. The sources usually depend on the scale of the firm, its level of income, and its current position in the market. The easiest and most accessible way to pay for Advanced Document System is from the cash flow, especially if the company has a surplus of profit. Some companies do not possess many employees and income, and they can take a bank loan to cover the costs of the system. The bank loan can also be helpful when the service is needed for many seats that have to be united and optimized. Then, the costs spent on the system increase, and extra funding might be needed. To increase the cash flow, the company can also go to the equity market and issue the stocks. The more stocks are sold to shareholders, the more cash flow the firm receives and can use for different needs. The other way to find alternative funding sources is to issue bonds that represent a fixed-income instrument. A bond is a debt obligation meaning that the company loans from an investor a specific sum of money. Bonds are safe for investors and faster to get for the company because more people invest in bonds as a safer method. Finally, the company can use mixed funding to get the cash for the payment which means uniting several methods described above. All the funding opportunities are possible for buying and implementing the Advanced Documentation System.",
    "Rolling Stones were in the shadow of the Beatles from the very beginning, and this fact disturbed them a lot. On the other hand, most of the fame went to the Beatles, and the Rolling Stones constantly felt their superiority. To be different, they tried to become the anti-Beatles. The legendary Beatles were a pioneer of hard rock: the musical influence of the song Helter Skelter led to the emergence of heavy metal (Covach and Bell 28). The influence of The Rolling Stones on the formation and development of rock music cannot be overestimated. It was significant not only in music, like the Beatles but also in artistic and visual, image and mass media terms. In songwriting development, the Rolling Stones tried hard to keep up with their competitors, but it was not easy, and they seemed to be one step behind. A lot of what they did was a reaction to what the Beatles had already done. For example, when a sitar began to sound in the Beatles’ composition, it immediately appeared in the Rolling Stones. The Beatles, with their working-class origins in provincial Liverpool, sought to maintain an elegant image (Covach and Bell 28). They dressed in decent suits, cut their hair neatly and short, and communicated politely with everyone. The Rolling Stones did the opposite: they wore black leather clothes and looked and behaved provocatively. In 1964, when The Beatles first came to the US, it was called the British invasion (Covach and Bell 28). The Beatles took all five first places in the Billboard singles chart at once and became the only ones who were able to set such a record (Covach and Bell 28). The Rolling Stones also achieved success in the US, mainly through shocking exposure, but they did not shake the Beatles’ position. Many of the rock bands of the 60s, The Beatles and The Rolling Stones, are seen as irreconcilable rivals. The reasons to think so are quite weighty: they played different music and had different images. However, both groups have influenced music around the world and have become one of the most recognizable – this is their main similarity.",
    "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic and long-term disorder characterized by uncontrollable, repeated thoughts and behaviors that an individual feels the need to repeat over and over. The case of Robert, a twenty-three-year-old young man, will be discussed further. Robert came to a mental health facility to get treated for anxiety, but it soon turned out that he rather struggled with OCD because he strongly smelled of disinfectant and reported excessive cleaning behaviors. After being in contact with surfaces and people, Robert felt a strong urge to wash his hands with bleach. He could wash his hands up to thirty times a day, which damaged his skin dramatically. However, the fear of germs was much stronger, and he could not stand touching something without washing his hands afterward. The issue of cleanliness took a great toll on his mental health. During the pandemic, the symptoms of OCD increased significantly. Robert reported wearing a HAZMAT suit outside, afraid of contracting the virus. In his social life, Robert avoids making physical contact with people and prefers keeping his distance from them. He works remotely from home, which quite pleases him because he does not have to go anywhere and spend time with other people in a confined space. Overall, Robert does not have a dependency on other people when it comes to handling his OCD and prefers being on his own the majority of the time. In Robert’s case, the combination of behavior therapy and pharmacological treatment is possible. Cognitive-behavioral treatment can be implemented for treating Robert’s OCD, including exposure and response prevention and cognitive restructuring (Moody, 2017). It is expected that Robert will feel relief from his symptoms within several weeks.",
    "Physical examination of the affected regions of the skin is necessary. Individuals with cellulitis are likely to have a reddened region of the skin, swelling as well as intense pain (Brown & Watson, 2022). Brant experiences pain in his right leg, in a reddened region that is swollen. The affected area should be thoroughly checked for any signs of skin disintegration. Variations in temperature in the area should be monitored along with signs of an abscess (Sutherland & Parent, 2017). Brant revealed that he was bit by a mosquito on the reddened area. This being a seemingly severe case, the physician may order complete blood count (CBC) testing. This will help measure blood count levels (Bennett et al., 2020). A CBC will allow the physician to make an accurate early diagnosis of a wide range of medical conditions. The physician may also order a C-reactive protein (CRP) test, which is a blood test for inflammation. This would be a necessity since Brant has broken skin because of a mosquito bite (Sutherland & Parent, 2017). Brant’s case is an event of major systemic disturbance since there is a manifestation of chills and acute disorientation. Priority diagnostic criteria for Brant would include assessing the occurrence of erythematous inflammation in the basal dermis and subcutaneous tissue. Redness, swelling, and pain are all signs of cellulitis (Sutherland & Parent, 2017). Erythema must be present in order to make the diagnosis. The location and nature of broken skin should also be assessed. For cellulitis to be diagnosed, the patient’s skin must be checked for micro-abrasions resulting from insect bites (Brown & Watson, 2022). Lower limbs are commonly affected. Brant’s positioning and movement should be adjusted. To reduce swelling in the areas facing downward, Brant’s feet and arms should be propped up on cushions while he lays on his back (Zariquiey-Esteva & Santa-Candela, 2017). If Brant stands for a long time, speedy blood flow to the heart may be hindered, which could cause low blood pressure. Brant may also need to be placed on his side in the recovery position, particularly whenever he feels nauseated or feels like vomiting. From the assessment, he feels nauseated and weak and has vomited on numerous occasions (Zariquiey-Esteva & Santa-Candela, 2017). This will help avoid low blood pressure. When germs break through the skin, “cytokines” and “neutrophils” are released into the bloodstream to fight them off. This causes cellulitis, which is characterized by redness, warmth, swelling, and pain (Brown & Watson, 2022, para 5). This appears to have been the case for Brant. He was bitten by a mosquito, which broke his skin, allowing bacteria (Streptococcus pyogenes) to penetrate the area. An outbreak of redness and swelling occurred when “cytokines and neutrophils” were drawn to the area of the skin to fight against the bacteria (Brown & Watson, 2022, para 5).",
    "One of the distinct characteristics of the nursing craft is the professionals’ need to constantly adapt to the dynamic environment of health care service and approaches to patient care. In order to facilitate this process, researchers have identified a series of change theories that seek to systematize the experience of implementing new practices (Udod & Wagner, 2018). The two most widespread theories of change in the nursing practice are Lewin’s change theory and Roger’s five-step theory. In Lewin’s framework, the change process undergoes three major stages: unfreezing, change proper, and refreezing (Udod & Wagner, 2018). Thus, according to this framework, in order to introduce change, the team needs to acknowledge the existing workflow and “unfreeze” this system, actively participate in implementing change and new functional patterns, and, finally, make the change a new generally accepted standard. Unlike Lewin’s approach, Roger’s model is more oriented towards the staff’s response and acceptance of the change through the gradual shifting process. Indeed, this five-step model implies exhaustive preliminary research, gathering staff’s feedback, conducting a pilot study, and actually implementing the change proposal (Udod & Wagner, 2018). Hence, it may be concluded that while Lewin’s model addresses mostly the implementation of the evidence-proven modifications, the five-step model is designed to prove the suggested change beneficial to the clinical environment. When speaking of the change proposal for the capstone project, Roger’s approach to change implementation is more appropriate. Considering the fact that the project seeks to justify the hypothesis of the EBP training’s positive impact on nurses’ self-esteem and patient satisfaction, the data collected from the intervention will be crucial for further implementation of this change to nursing practice. This theory has also been proven advantageous by the preceptor, as she has successfully integrated changes into the staff’s scheduling patterns using Roger’s model.",
    "It is necessary to fully understand the fundamental difference between the concepts of a leader and a regular employee in any field. While the head of the company is most often focused on the internal financial processes, a good leader understands the paramount importance of employees in any enterprise. The ideal leader sees the potential in every person and helps them develop to the maximum while working with them in the same direction instead of putting pressure. The policy of actions of flawed leaders can lead to more than unpleasant consequences for all sides of any business. Unfortunately, imperfect leaders in our time can be found a lot in any field. Bad experiences can happen on any level, from personal to global. It is particularly difficult to single out a specific person without personal experience and hard evidence, but statistics show an extremely high proportion of unscrupulous people in high positions. According to available data, the owner of Ali Express online retailer, Jack Ma, can be cited as an example. Plenty of evidence suggests that most of the items available to order are made by underage children from the poorest parts of the world. With the tacit consent of Jack Ma, many thousands of people are being exploited for minimal pay and terrible living conditions. It is an example of a person who is not only a bad leader but intentionally contributes to the violation of human rights. One of the biggest problems, in this case, is the lack of empathy and humanism. A bad leader always looks at people through the prism of a solid resource and cheap labor. It is difficult for an imperfect leader to hear and understand a person’s intentions through the prism of ignorance and selfishness. It is the absolute wrong approach, leading to nothing but a dead end. However, it should be noted that any statement in this vein is a serious accusation and requires additional thorough collection and analysis of data. The exploitation of people in any level of relationship, from business to politics, cannot lead to a successful and fulfilled conclusion. The best people and professionals will not tolerate such an attitude and quickly find a replacement with better conditions. The main mistake of many leaders in any business is an overly egocentric picture of the world and a tendency to immoral exploitation of people’s resources.",
    "Developing a contract so that all parties involved could be aware of their obligations and meet them accordingly is one of the vital tasks for an organization. Charles Schwab, an organization offering banking and brokerage services, has developed a contract for its users to sign so that both parties could meet the respective requirements (Reder et al., 2021). For their collaboration. Since the contract in question contains the essential components of a legal agreement, it can be considered viable. Starting with the key definitions of the foundational concepts on which the agreement is based, Schwab’s contract establishes the offer, acceptance, and legality terms from the start exceptionally clearly. The specified clarity and transparency benefit the company and its customers, promoting immediate trust and cooperation (Templin, 2017). Remarkably, Schwab also provides a robust basis for the consideration element of the agreement. Namely, the contract outlines the legal issues associated with the disbursement process, as well as the associated trading concerns (“Schwab account agreement,” 2022). Outlining that Schwab is not responsible for tracking the trading process, the contract sets the key responsibilities and relations between the parties completely clearly. Incorporating the primary components of a legal contract, the brokerage agreement created by Schwab offers its customers a chance to familiarize themselves closely with the services that they will obtain and the responsibilities that they have. Similarly, the contract outlines the crucial responsibilities of Schwab, thus, creating a basis for cooperation and the successful delivery of the end product to the customer. Overall, Schwab’s approach to contract development can be considered a prime example of how a contract should be structured due to the close focus on key issues and the clear delineation of all parties’ roles and rights.",
    "Differences between primary and secondary sources Primary sources are the ones providing first-hand evidence on the events or phenomena that one is studying. Such sources include diaries, photographs, video and audio recordings, interview transcripts, works of art, statistical data, and others. All of these types of sources give the researcher a possibility to learn about the investigated matter directly by observing it or reading/listening about it from first-hand witnesses. In case of the Chernobyl Nuclear Plant Disaster, the most relevant primary sources include reports, documents, and local newspapers of that time, photographs, and interviews of witnesses. By using such resources, one can obtain the possibility to learn unbiased facts and obtain the most relevant information about the event or phenomenon under investigation. Moreover, when analyzing primary sources, the researcher can become immersed in the atmosphere in which the object of investigation existed and the circumstances under which it developed. For instance, for historians and archeologists, such primary sources as ancient fossils or some tribes’ belongings serve both as sources of information and inspiration. On the other hand, for someone analyzing a political or environmental issue, reports and pertinent news releases will be helpful sources of reliable data. Meanwhile, secondary sources offer second-hand information and analyses from other researchers. Secondary sources include books, reviews, and scholarly articles investigating the subject of research. By analyzing secondary sources, one can get a deeper understanding of both the analyzed phenomenon and the primary sources. While primary sources offer a first-hand view of the situation, secondary ones enable the researcher to synthesize the material on the topic. Explain why it is important to consult a variety of sources when conducting historical research Both types of sources are crucial in research since they complement each other. Whereas primary sources offer credible evidence, secondary sources provide additional information and valuable synthesis. However, even when one possesses a primary and a secondary source, it is not enough for completing a thorough research endeavor. One needs much more than a few sources, however credible they might be. It is of utmost importance to consult a variety of sources when conducting historical research since in each new source, valuable additional evidence can be found. Also, when the same data occurs in several sources, its credibility increases. At the same time, the presence of different pieces of information gives the researcher food for thought and allows posing new questions and seeking new answers. That is why the more sources one has at one’s disposal, the better. It is crucial to consult not only a wide range of sources but also different types of them since authors of articles and books, for instance, have divergent approaches to synthesizing data.",
    "The development of the Chesapeake colonies is a bright example of how slavery became one of the integral parts of societies existing on these lands. The necessity to grow specific crops and use them to earn money and survive resulted in the constantly growing demand for the workforce. However, the practice of using indentured servants was ineffective because of the end date of their contracts. It meant that new sources of people to work on fields and plantations were needed. The resolution of the given problem was a matter of survival, as the inability to raise crops would mean death for the whole community (Kidd, 2019). Under these conditions, the development of slavery was inevitable as people stripped of their rights could be used to perform diverse tasks, and the term of exploitation was not limited. It created the basis for the evolution of slavery which became one of the fundamental institutions functioning on these lands. At the same time, the example of the Middle colonies proves that the enslavement of people and their use as a cheap workforce was inevitable. Although the pacific principles of Quakerism dominated these lands at the first stages of their evolution, settlers still needed people to perform complex tasks and support the evolution of colonies. Regarding the limited number of arriving settlers, slavery became the possible option to compensate for the deficit and create the basis for future expansion. The given trend was similar to the Middle and Chesapeake colonies, proving specific attitudes to slavery peculiar to people of that period (Huntley, 2019). They were ready to promote further evolution of this institution as the central way to support the development of the agricultural sector critical for survival and enrichment.",
    "In his writing, Daniel Spanjer claims that the Christian worldview has influenced the study of Liberal Arts. He discusses science and how humans are the products of the world – they are endowed with feeling and thought, which are beyond natural (Spanjer 3). The author differentiates the reasons for learning everything surrounding people and claims that thinkers can answer many questions, either logical or surreal. These people have developed a term worldview “to describe this holistic concept of learning, scholarship, experience and knowledge” (Spanjer 15). Even though sometimes they cannot agree on the solution to the problems, time helps them dissipate false beliefs. The other reading by Brad Green suggests the interconnection of words and faith. In the chapter. When transcendent realities and goals surround a language, it is magnificent, but when transcendence is taken away from it, it falls apart and loses its glory (Green). The word was sent by God to save humanity; He portrayed people through the words (Green). Hence, humans should follow God’s guidelines in the Bible because His sayings are truthful. In case the words are devoid of meaning, the speech is useless. The last reading by Dockery narrates about the Christian faith’s influence on learning. People are encouraged to think in Christian categories in order to sanctify thoughts and beliefs (Dockery 4). It is vital to seek God’s guidance and His calls that help humans contribute to the societal good (Dockery 8). Thoughtful believers are needed to revive faith-centered higher educational institutions because only such people will be able to promote gracious deeds. Hence, Christian worldview is again viewed as foundation of successful education and learning.",
    "Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation (NDT) is a scientific and clinical European journal. It is a collection of articles that analyze dialysis, transplantation, and nephrology research. Moreover, the NDT journal is officially approved by the European Renal Association (ERA). Thus, it presents crucial analysis and data for scientists worldwide. Additionally, the other article from StatPearls was selected as the source is included in the National Center for Biotechnological Information (NCBI). Therefore, the center distributes and stores information about scientifically approved research. The article focuses on the leading causes of chronic inflammation at the time of end-stage renal failure. In addition, the authors describe the impact of disease on clinical outcomes and the role of middle molecules as significant factors in the onset of pathology. The latest breakthroughs and research in dialysis are reviewed to stabilize the situation. The end stage of kidney damage is the stage of the development of chronic renal failure. In this case, the disease enters the final stage and threatens human life and health. Only a decrease in urine excreted (diuresis) is observed at the initial step. At stage 2, other signs appear, and nausea and a large amount of urine appear. At stage 3, the fluid does not leave, and diuresis stops. The kidneys fail, and acute renal failure develops, which leads to a deterioration in well-being. Treatment of end-stage kidney damage in adults involves taking medications. Chronic renal failure occurs in 200-500 out of one million people. Currently, the population with chronic renal failure is increasing annually by 10-12%. Morbidities with the end-stage renal disease lead to a person’s diuresis being reduced to almost zero. With advanced forms of chronic renal failure, pulmonary edema develops. At the moment, the prevalence rate of the disease includes about 759 people per million population. The incidence rate is not available for all countries globally, so it isn’t easy to analyze the information in detail. However, the average number of newly reported cases is 144 per million. The mortality rate is decreasing and currently stands at approximately 28%. Doctors prescribe a blood test to assess creatinine, potassium, and urea to determine the disease. Moreover, such a procedure as an ultrasound of the kidneys is performed. If necessary, the doctor prescribes catheterization of the renal pelvis and angiography of the kidneys.",
    "Elephants dance the polonaise, sea lions juggle balls, bears ride bicycles, a tiger jumps through a burning hoop – all these are attractions with four-legged performers that thrill the audience, especially the little ones. Nevertheless, animal rights activists have sounded the alarm because circus tricks are unnatural for wild creatures; they are considered mockery and torture. There should be a thoroughgoing prohibition on the exploitation of animals in circuses, as this issue is contrary to humane treatment and is a direct violation of their rights. Since the 1970s, numerous nations have been setting up laws to treat creatures and guarantee their essential protection. International agreements were concluded, recognizing that animals are sentient beings whose basic needs must be respected and protected (Marino 148). Significantly, the tricks taught to animals for the public’s entertainment have nothing familiar with their natural behavior. The only way to make them obey is to punish and deprive them of food so that the poor starving creature will do anything for a coveted bite (Arnold-Foster 146). Animals must maintain and express behavior specific to their species, and the concept of circuses contradicts this shepherd. Furthermore, the phrase “animal performers” often evokes positive emotions because acting is always associated with romance. However, unlike their human counterparts, animals never voluntarily choose the profession of actor. Circus experience means losing freedom forever, spending 95% of the time alone, in a cramped cage where animals cannot stand up to the full height and turn around (Ward 131). They suffer extensively, but there is nothing they can change because humans are more thoughtful and cunningly use force. It can be concluded that introducing restrictions on the exploitation of animals in the circus is a necessary measure in the current world. Creatures must be permitted to follow their instincts and be in their natural habitat because that is their fundamental freedom. All people must comprehend that the rights of animals must be protected and, therefore, one must refuse to visit performances that have been created through violence and cruelty.",
    "Commitment to health theory is a special model designed to determine the stages of development and behavior changes. This theory assumes the development of an internal state, as well as the acceptance of the desire to lead a healthy lifestyle under the conditions that any circumstances may limit a person. Moreover, with the help of this theory, the necessary level is determined, which indicates a particular stage of human health (Kelly, 2014). In addition, this theory assumes that there are no established differences, such as gender, race, and others, in order to build behavior aimed at developing a healthy lifestyle. In her research, Kelly (2008) uses the principles of the Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change. First of all, this is done in order to demonstrate certain stages of the change process. Furthermore, the model used sets specific requirements for health. Thus, the Commitment to Health Theory uses such principles as stages of change, decisive balance, and self-efficiency (Prochaska & Velicer, 1997). In this way, Kelly uses essential principles of this theory; thus, they are interrelated. Concerning advanced nursing practice, this theory can be used as a measurement of some patient indicators. Thus, this model will help determine the goals necessary for the patient to instill the desire to lead a healthy lifestyle. In practice, this theory will also help track the process of change and how to behave with the patient (Kelly, 2008). For example, at the first stage, the task is to instill confidence, as well as to indicate the importance of the necessary changes. At the second stage, strategies are already being applied to strengthen the patient’s desire to improve the overall state of health. The third stage is the final one, and it should introduce the behavioral patterns necessary for maintaining a healthy lifestyle. As a result, health care professionals can use stages of change categories and commitment ratings to personalize therapy by employing change-specific tactics and motivating therapeutic communication techniques.",
    "Being a knowledgeable and experienced professional in one’s professional sphere is, without a doubt, of great importance. For this reason, many students of medical education facilities seek to acquire as much theoretical and practical expertise as possible before graduation. Although such a strategy is by no means wrong, I have recently discovered that the true success in the work of healthcare providers is explained by the doctor’s ability to build relationships with one’s patients. I fully understood the advantage of this simple but often overlooked truth when observing Dr. Wang’s work. Dr. Wang is an experienced professional working in the sphere of eye surgery. Yet, it was surprising for me to discover how easily he/she is able to build close relationships with the patients. After analyzing her/his behavior, I realized that there are certain skills that allow Dr. Wang to gain the trust of the people that come to the Eye Surgery Institute. First of all, he/she is an active listener meaning that all of Dr. Wang’s patients are encouraged to fully and openly express their symptoms and feelings without being interrupted. Secondly, Dr. Wang is always polite and patient with people regardless of her/his overall mood. Finally, I noticed that Dr. Wang is friendly with regular patients as she/he is interested in their health and everyday lives. For instance, I heard Dr. Wang asking a woman regarding her daughter’s health because the patient mentioned that the latter was sick during the last session. As a result of such an attitude towards people, I saw that many treated people could share their problems openly with Dr. Wang as they trusted her/him. In turn, I saw that this allowed the professional to deliver better and more accurate treatment. Moreover, seeing the positive outcome that the ability to build a trustful relationship with the patients has on the healthcare provision, I have become determined to develop this quality. In this regard, I hope that my description of Dr. Wang’s practice will also inspire other current and future medical workers to develop their communication skills.",
    "One of the social factors that might impact what groceries are purchased is the lack of healthy food. Addressing Wal-Mart in Forest Part allows me to gather enough information about available products and their prices. For example, one gallon of great value milk is $2.65, one loaf of Sara Lee bread is $2.44, one bag of gala apples is $3.58, and one bag of organic baby carrots is $3.88. Continuing my visit, the prices are as follows: one yogurt container is $1.92, 2-liter of Pepsi Soda is $1.98, one bag of chips is $2.84, and one family-size pack of cookies is $3.98. In Maywood, IL 60153, the population is mostly African Americans (68.6%), but white citizens (18.2%) and Hispanic/Latino (26.9%) also live there (United States Census Bureau, n.d.). The chosen living area lacks good grocery stores, but the number of fast-food restaurants has significantly increased during the last few years. It means that people are not able to buy healthy food but have to eat poor-quality products, contributing to their health problems like hypertension and diabetes. Another social factor that affects human health and shopping habits is poor transformation and the impossibility for the working class to visit Wal-Mart regularly. The median household income in the chosen region is about $50,176, and the poverty level is about 15% (United States Census Bureau, n.d.). It means that not all individuals can go to the stores with good food and make decisions, not at the expense of their health. The combination of transportation, low income, and food factors are critical for public health (Islam, 2019). It is not enough to identify a problem but find ways to solve it and help the population achieve improvements. A community health nurse (CHN) is responsible for promoting public health and the choice of interventions to address food security. According to Schffer and Strohschein (2019), there are 17 interventions introduced in five groups with different colors, and collaboration is a unique opportunity for all community members to promote and protect health. The main characteristics of this intervention are a high commitment level, partnership, and goal orientation (Schffer & Strohschein, 2019). Collaboration at systems levels helps CHNs reach all appropriate stakeholders, community collaboration is necessary to analyze the current state of affairs, and cooperation with families improves personal knowledge and engagement.",
    "In the history of mankind, the computer has become one of the most important inventions. Hardly anyone can imagine a modern home or office without computers. While some people argue that the computer has provided us with additional conveniences, according to others, the computer has made our life more complex and stressful. I believe that computers, in the first place, have enriched our society with several advantages due to faster communication and easier access to information. The computer provides us with a fast way to communicate. In our time, when modern society is becoming more global, computers play an essential role in communication systems. Previously, communication was limited to means such as mail (Grudin, 2017). If a businessman traveled abroad, the sending of reports and reports, as a rule, was accompanied by significant delays. Since the competitiveness of a business depends on time, this situation was completely unacceptable. The Internet has allowed businesses to send messages instantly. Staff can send emails or instant messages to a manager anywhere in the world (Grudin, 2017). This has added efficiency to businesses and expanded business opportunities. For me, a computer is a technological necessity that makes my life more enjoyable and interesting. First of all, a computer is an excellent leisure tool. Watching movies and various sci-fi programs through my electronic companion is very convenient and comfortable. Also, my daily work, which brings me the lion’s share of my cash income, is not in the least tied to the computer, so it is not just a means of interactivity and entertainment but also a tool for making money. Physicians and other healthcare workers use computers for many essential uses. Computer hardware is widely used in making a diagnosis, conducting examinations and preventive examinations are examples of computer devices and methods of treatment and diagnosis (Farinella & Marco, 2018). Computed tomography and nuclear medical diagnostics provide accurate layered images of internal organ structures (Farinella & Marco, 2018). Ultrasound diagnostics and probing, using the effects of the interaction of incident and reflected ultrasonic waves, opens countless possibilities for obtaining images of internal organs and studying their condition. The diagnostics and treatment methods will be much easier with the help of computer intervention.",
    "In relation to building construction, Code of Practice may be defined as a particular set of standards, procedures, and regulations to which a contractor and developer should adhere to manage potential environmental consequences caused by construction works. For large clients, local authorities, and public bodies, it is applied to new developments and sets out requirements related to the impact of construction. It aims to provide guidance within the framework of legal, administrative, and technical systems for the protection of workers, the environment, and the public and control over major hazard installations. According to the code, by arranging separation between large centers of population, including housing, shops, schools, and hospitals, and major hazard installations and developing appropriate emergency planning, major accidents that may occur at these installations will be prevented. Code of Practice is applied to major hazard installations identified on the basis of a list of hazardous substances associated with threshold quantities. They require priority attention due to the potential for causing highly serious incidents that may negatively impact the environment and people. Thus, major hazard installations include oil refineries, petrochemical and chemical works, storage of flammable liquids, gas, and liquefied petroleum gas, fertilizer works, chemical warehouses, and water treatment works connected with chlorine. Nuclear hazards, hazards of a military nature, and the transportation of potentially hazardous chemicals are excluded from the code due to the differences in their control and management. In general, the code includes a list of activities for competent authorities that should be performed in order to establish major hazard control systems for the prevention of incidents. Competent authorities include government inspectorates and safety authorities, police, local authorities, workers and their representatives, works managements, fire and health authorities, suppliers of major hazard technologies, and other involved organizations.",
    "In the present day, the preservation of Confederate statues provokes multiple discussions. According to the official political agenda supported by former President Donald Trump, these monuments are the historical symbols of the United States that should be protected. However, more and more evidence supports the public opinion that Confederate statues should be removed as they aim to demonstrate racial disparities and the supremacy of Whites. The main argument of this claim is supported by the fact that the majority of monuments were erected not directly after the Civil War but in the 1900-the 1920s (Best, 2020). During this period, several discriminatory laws against Black people’s social rights were enacted. The construction of Confederate monuments was sponsored by the United Daughters of the Confederacy. In the present day, it was regarded as a part of the union’s long-lasting strategy that aimed to strengthen White supremacy and social inequities based on race. The connection of statues with structured racism is obvious as the second wave of Confederate monuments’ erection was in the 1920-1940s, along with “Black Americans’ fighting for civil rights and pushing back against widespread lynchings in the South” (Best, 2020, para. 4). Thus, Confederate monuments placed across Southern states, especially on courthouse grounds, aimed to demonstrate the protection of Whites by the law. The undeniable racial context of monuments’ construction has finally led to their removal or relocation during the last several years in response to discrimination against Black citizens. From a personal perspective, it is impossible to deny that Confederate statues were directly connected with efforts to strengthen White supremacy. That is why a considerable number of them may be removed – however, not all. In general, human history includes both positive and negative events. Although a considerable number of people prefer to destroy all attributes of tragic times, they should be remembered as well. In other words, mistakes of the past should be remembered for their avoidance in the future.",
    "Conflict management at the workplace is one of the crucial elements related to the organization of work in healthcare facilities. In this regard, McKibben (2017) asserts that conflict is an inevitable part of any human interaction, especially when the collective activity is associated with physical, mental, and ethical complexity found in hospitals. Consequently, if ignored or not handled adequately, the disputes between the colleges at the workplace lead to decreased performance and satisfaction levels of the involved employees (Suifan, Alhyari, & Sweis, 2020). This, in turn, negatively impacts the overall quality of provided patient care. Therefore, it is important to resolve the conflicts as soon as they appear. However, to understand how to manage disputes effectively, one should understand the factors that cause them. In general, all the antecedents of organizational conflicts may be divided into three groups, namely individual, interpersonal, and organizational. As for the former, Kim et al. (2017) argue that the healthcare professional’s self-esteem, self-focus, emotional intelligence, prevalent responses to conflict, communication styles, and overall worldview determine the frequency and severity of the disputes. In a similar vein, Chang, Chen, and Chen (2017) found that a person’s license level, age, and previous experience of working in other collectives can all affect the behavior during conflict situations. Interpersonal conflicts, on the contrary, are caused by such factors as lack of trust and respect towards a person, power abuse, and ineffective communication (Kim et al., 2017). Finally, organizational conflicts stem from the overall structure and work arrangement. In this respect, such factors as ambiguously defined responsibilities and inadequate hierarchy can cause dissatisfaction and disputes (Kim et al., 2017; McKibben, 2017). Therefore, this type of conflict appears as a result of weak or wrongful management decisions. I have also participated in several conflicts that can be explained by the factors mentioned above. Firstly, I have a friend who is generally a good person but who is quite self-focused; thus, he often fails to recognize other people’s opinions. Due to that, we usually have to do what he wants, which eventually leads to conflict when I become tired of compromising. Secondly, I have noticed that many conflicts between me and my parents and friends are caused by my inability to control one’s emotions. Finally, once, we had a conflict with my classmates while working on the team project as we failed to discuss the responsibilities of each person before starting.",
    "In many philosophies, some archetypes can be described as the perfect self in terms of the way of living one’s life. In Confucianism, such a man called junzi — a noble person or gentleman — is a common aspiration (Yu-kit 223). The combination of the highest qualities that an ideal human being should possess is an almost unachievable goal, yet the one that is held in high regard by many. This essay will describe the Confucian gentleman and compare this idealistic archetype with Plato’s philosopher-king. This idea that stems from the traditional Chinese culture continues to hold its importance for society. Such a man stands above evil ideas, recognizes them, and counteracts their effects to the best of their abilities (Yu-kit 225). Moreover, the Confucian gentleman helps others to do so through the transfer of knowledge (Yu-kit 223). Yu-kit writes that a noble person, according to Confucius, must take “a dual role of an exemplar and educator” (224). Virtues are the second nature of this man, and he exhibits them daily. The Confucian gentleman is the one who lives by the highest moral standards and aims to help others achieve the realization of this goal. Plato’s philosopher-king possesses several similarities to this archetypical role. They both are set to exhibit certain positive moral qualities while addressing negative ones through reason and rationale. He is ultimately humble and stoic and continuously seeks wisdom for the sake of the betterment of society (Mark). Notably, Plato’s archetype is more leaning toward education rather than living life as a role model for others. In conclusion, both roles possess certain qualities that define a noble person following moral qualities, such as kindness, fairness, selflessness, and the striving for harmony. However, Plato’s version of an ideal person is a stoic leader who puts wisdom at the highest value, while the Confucian gentleman is set to uphold moral values first. They are both set to uplift the personal values of other people through kindness and selflessness.",
    "Corporate entrepreneurship is the process by which groups inside an existing corporation build, foster, promote, and administer a new business distinct from the parent organization. However, these new entities emphasize the parent’s holdings, competitive positioning, knowledge, or other capabilities. The new groups may also be an oxymoron while again utilizing the unconventional approach to further economic growth alongside the meticulous planning, framework, and organization that several large firms have developed over time (Demirkan et al., 2019). Instead of reclining on their glories, the world’s wealthiest organizations, such as Amazon as well as Samsung, are progressively undertaking proactive innovation projects to prevent disruption. Amazon Custom is an excellent extension of an existing innovative initiative that has reaped the benefits of both evolutionary and radical tactics. As the name indicates, this ambitious new approach allows suppliers to provide customized items on Amazon for the first time (for example, custom text, customization, and so on) (Demirkan et al., 2019). Samsung’s innovative business strategy entails delegating new projects to an expert ‘creative elite,’ guaranteeing that they are prepared to include best practices and produce maximum KPIs (Demirkan et al., 2019). To achieve these objectives, the industry’s inventive elite use open innovation as well as corporate technical reconnaissance strategies. New product advocates explore ideas for new merchandise by independent strategic orientation, a bottom-up method. The iPod is an excellent example. It was built with the help of the company’s workers’ staffing and engineering knowledge. This approach adheres to the company’s existing strategies. Inspired strategic behavior is a top-down procedure in which policy is processed via the company’s pre-existing hierarchical structure (Demirkan et al., 2019). This process is consistent with the firm’s existing approaches, with the iPhone serving as an example. As a result, the most likely commercial development is induced business strategy. The focus of creative behavior strategy is on human effort rather than the technological aspect. It includes new ideas, products, and procedures into a person’s position. He subsequently becomes an expert in the field and works for the firm to generate fresh ideas.",
    "It is clear to modern people, as well as many people who lived in the 1930s, that the Second World War was inevitable. Some believe that the United States of America could prevent the outbreak of the war. However, this could hardly be possible due to several reasons. The American government maintained an isolationist foreign policy in the 1930s. The period was challenging as all countries had to address severe economic issues (Corbett et al., 2021). Americans wanted to concentrate on domestic matters, including a threatening spread of communist ideas (Russett, 2019). It is noteworthy that the USA could hardly interfere and have a considerable impact on European affairs due to the country’s comparatively low economic might. The United States was not a financial leader at that period, so its influence was limited. Moreover, the USA alone could not prevent the world war because it was outbroken as a result of the clash between European countries. The outcomes of the Treaty of Versailles laid the ground for the new war, as almost all stakeholders were dissatisfied. Germany accumulated resources and developed alliances with other dictatorships, so any country could not play a decisive role in this conflict. No nation could prevent the start of the new war as the regimes that emerged in Europe (the communist USSR, Nazi Germany, and fascist Italy) were likely to start a new military conflict that would inevitably grow into a world war. Therefore, it is possible to assume that the USA could not have prevented the start of the Second World War even if the American government had abandoned its isolationist foreign policy. At that, the country made a tremendous contribution to stopping the war and establishing a new world order.",
    "This paper will provide an analysis of the article “COVID-19: Impact on Nurses and Nursing” by Fauteux (2021). The abstract is supposed to be the opening of the article. It is a way to quickly introduce the reader to the results of the research. In this article, the abstract is a brief overview of the topic that will be discussed. However, it contains no information about the methods of the research or its results. On this basis, such an abstract cannot be called comprehensive. The article’s introduction is already more extensive, offering a general overview of the topic. It provides information that the times of coronavirus pandemic have affected nursing. In addition, the introduction has statistics, which introduce the reader to the subject in a tangible way. From the introduction, I learned about the general factors of COVID’s effect on nursing, including increased mortality, changes in work practices, and increased workload. This introduction can be considered extensive and adequate. The research method of this article is qualitative in that a review of a body of research draws empirical conclusions. These conclusions relate to the significant changes that have occurred in nursing and its nature. The study uses quantitative data that has already been processed and presents an overview of information previously analyzed. The result of the study is the identification of the main factors of change in nursing. These include the intensification of collaboration and innovation, the removal of practice barriers, the popularization of telemedicine, and the increased risks of burnout (Fauteux, 2021). I learned how much nursing has been affected by the pandemic. I was mostly interested in the increased risk of nurse burnout due to too much workload. I also learned about the popularization of telemedicine due to the pandemic, which was a revelation to me because the attitude of the patients to their health seems to have drastically changed after the virus outbreak. This article is beneficial in understanding how an entire division of medical practice can change under extreme conditions.",
    "Historically, law enforcement was founded on the need to ensure citizens’ safety, possession, and health and to safeguard the people from civil disorder and crime. As such, Harris (2020) shows that law enforcement’s lawful powers included using force legitimized by the government or arrests through a monopoly on violence. In its primitive system, law enforcement clan members banded together to enforce rules of the group on rogue members. The purpose behind enforcing societal directives, conducting human control, and empowering authoritative enforcement of those rules was to safeguard the people from rogue members. The community believed that any form of violence against any of them was tantamount to an attack on the rest (Harris, 2020). Therefore, to achieve its purpose, early law enforcement employed three fundamental features, no coercion, law enforcement had a wide array of tasks. The third feature was a critical distinction between the people legally endowed with policing responsibilities and those who carried out policing duties. Peace offices have the mandate of ensuring that whether on or off duty, they shall not commit any crime knowingly under the country’s laws. In the U.S., for example, peace officers are bound by local and state jurisdiction not to commit a crime. The other responsibilities of the peace officer are to not knowingly disobey the rule of law on criminal procedures, especially in such areas as detention, arrests, evidence preservation, and the use of informants (Schroeder & Lombardo, 2018). Further, no peace officer shall exceed their authority when enforcing the law, and no individual freedom shall be restricted by peace officers (Schroeder & Lombardo, 2018). Only except the law is police officers allowed to disobey the rule of law relative to the criminal procedures.",
    "The phenomenon of slavery is one of the most devastating factors that affected the lives of people of African descent throughout the years. However, it is essential to address the origins of racism and slavery in order to create a comprehensive understanding of these concepts. In the chapter “The Origin of Negro Slavery”, Williams explains that although currently slavery is deeply connected to the exploitation of African Americans, initially, populations of various races and ethnicities were occupied as enslaved people (Williams 7). Considering that individuals of all races were involved in slavery in the New World, racism emerged as a consequence of forced labor and was not originally connected to the targeted discrimination of African Americans. In the history of slavery, the first population compelled to undergo the severe process of enslavement was the Indians. For instance, Spanish explorers utilized Indian labor in their colonies to convert the population to Christianity, enforcing the necessity of slave labor on the individuals who refused to accept the Christian faith (Williams 8). Similarly, Great Britain and France supported slavery in the colonial territories; however, this event was not connected to racial predispositions but to the fact that slavery served as a preventative penalty for the indigenous communities. Nevertheless, over the course of history, enslaved Negroes became a highly more important asset in the slave trade due to the economic benefits, leading to the establishment of Negro slavery as a normal condition (Williams 21). As a result, racism and racial discrimination emerged, but the initial origin for substituting other enslaved people with African Americans remained economic, not racial. To conclude, the connection between slavery and racism lies in the fact that racial predispositions towards African Americans were caused by the overwhelming use of enslaved African Americans. As such, slavery did not emerge as a result of racism; on the contrary, individuals from various races and ethnic communities were involved in the slave trade. Nevertheless, after the economic benefits of using enslaved African Americans were established, negative racial stereotypes began to emerge, leading to the occurrence of racism.",
    "Culture is the entirety of social norms, behaviors, and customs which distinguish a certain society from the rest of the world. Naturally, some cultures have common features, thus forming cultural clusters. At the same time, leadership is a personality trait that transcends national boundaries. This does not imply that all people with power behave in the same manner, as leaders are also influenced by cultural norms. Behavior differences are evident in the way people in different clusters view time. Middle Eastern cultures are frequently juxtaposed to Western ones, particularly American. Beehner writes that while “most Middle Eastern nations are past oriented” and uphold traditions, “many Americans believe they can control the future and embrace change for the sole purpose of changing” (72). Barak Obama is an example of a leader who gained prominence by articulating the importance of change. The list of differences in leadership behaviors is not limited to the perception of the future. Crede et al. have conducted a study in which they ascertain cultural differences in relation to transformational leadership. (23). The most peculiar finding is that “transformational leadership exhibits stronger relationships with subordinate performance in cultures with low levels of gender egalitarianism values” (Crede et al. 23). This implies that the more traditional a culture is, the more successful leaders are likely to be in transformational endeavors. Altogether, there is a definite influence of culture on the conduct of leaders. Therefore, the definition of culture should include the importance of its effect on leadership behaviors. Not only does culture distinguish a certain social group, but it also underscores the likelihood of changes driven by people who have authority. After all, these people are the ones who make the most important decisions in society.",
    "The concept of culture is a fundamental phenomenon influencing all spheres of human life. It influences people’s actions, methods, and approaches toward specific tasks and daily interactions. Thus, Roseberry determines culture as a socially constructed and socially constitutive part of the context where all activities take place. It means that all other fundamental institutions and phenomena, such as power, economy, and history, comprise the culture. At the same time, being the way of life, it influences the mentioned spheres and preconditions for the emergence of critical processes in these domains. In other words, peculiarities of culture influence decision-making in political processes and historical events which took place at different stages of society’s evolution. Furthermore, the approaches to business in particular, and economy in general, depend on the values and visions peculiar to a bearer of a particular culture. For this reason, by understanding history and politics, it is possible to understand this unique notion and its layers. Rosebery also assumes that culture is socially constituted, meaning that many cultures share the same visions and values. For example, my own culture is similar to the culture of my friends and the people surrounding me as we live within the same context and share similar approaches. However, at the global level, my system of beliefs and visions differs from the same framework used by people from other regions to guide their decision-making and actions. It is explained by the social nature of culture and its unique character. It includes different perspectives and attitudes shared by people from similar communities and, at the same time, it influences their mentalities and visions. For this reason, it is possible to conclude that culture is a social construct influencing social interactions and fundamental institutions vital for everyday interactions.",
    "The process of forming states is not characterized by ease. It involves many different processes, including cultural strategies of strength. It is believed that this aspect in the form of actions of social agents is of particular importance. This is because they occupy a central place in such processes as the formation of alliances and the establishment of dominance relations. Understanding this concept can give a better understanding of the creation of Western Europe, China, the Islamic World, and India. First, it is necessary to understand what a social strategy of power is and what significance it has. Thus, it is defined as a particular area of practice where the creators of mass media have cultural influences and act as agents of social change. Thus, these sources form and influence public opinion, which may affect the formation of states. Gledhill emphasizes that the main reason for the difference between state and stateless societies is the centralization and non-centralization of power. Thus, the absence of the second aspect is expressed in inequality, and the absence of citizenship is associated with decentralization and vice versa with equality. Therefore, in conclusion, to understand the emergence of the state in the case of Western Europe, China, the Islamic World, and India, it is necessary to consider the culture strategy of power. Therefore, the author makes an attempt to distance from the generally accepted European principles and views on the role of social anthropology and factors in Chapter 3. In addition to many other political and economic factors, social influence is of significant importance. Social agents form public opinion and contribute to the formation of opinions. In this way, there is a relationship in the creation of the states of Europe, China, the Islamic World, and India and the social strategies of the authorities.",
    "Modification of personal computers required the development of more complex hardware and software. For example, buses, which are the communication channels between different internal components and peripheral devices, have become more advanced. Such three types of buses as address, control, and data are known (Farret et al., 2017). The latter is utilized for data exchange between the Central Processing Unit (CPU) and peripherals (Farret et al., 2017). The significance of the address bus is to assist the CPU in locating specific information in the memory, while the control bus regulates data processing. Data buses are represented as a multiple of two and currently include five types: 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 (Farret et al., 2017). These numbers indicate the bits of data that can be delivered simultaneously, and the larger ones allow for a more significant amount of information to be processed at a time. The number of parallel lines in a processor defines how many electrical signals can be exchanged between peripherals and the CPU. The most common operating systems on modern computers are 32 and 64-bit microprocessors. A 32-bit data bus contains thirty-two parallel lines between different structures. In contrast, a 64-bit data bus consists of sixty-four lines, allowing it to run twice as many data exchange processes (Farret et al., 2017). Hence, the fundamental difference between these two types of data buses is the speed at which they can process information. Similarly, the pace at which older versions run data depends on the number of paralleled copper wires between the CPU and other internal parts. Indeed, all these buses have one common function of interchanging data, but they vary in the rate at which operations are transferred due to their structural differences.",
    "Data science is the discipline that studies the life cycle of digital data from appearance to use in other fields of knowledge. It involves researching and analyzing substantial amounts of information and is focused primarily on obtaining practical results. The definition suggested by Os Keyes presumes that this science is the reduction of humanity to something that can be counted. This perspective is engaging in a way that Keyes’s perspective opposes the standard definition of data science. Perhaps, her expression implies that everything in this world could be measured since the discipline is concerned with countable objects and quantitative analysis. There is also an assumption that data science systems want to devour everything possible, including a human’s life, and quantify it. Finally, when it comes to the decision-making process, the systems eliminate the human factor, excluding individuals, thus making it inhumane. Numerous standardized tests are based on an algorithm that does not allow people to express their opinions. Typically, they are multiple-choice credits where one should choose the right answer. One mistake and one is at a point of no return. It means that systems only accept correct data, not allowing a human to err. As a result, humanity is accustomed to giving the right answers when necessary and at the same time being afraid to say something that will not be automatically approved. On the other hand, data science is vital in areas where mistakes should be avoided. For example, in healthcare, workers use different electronic systems that assist them in choosing the proper treatment and its dosage. Medication errors occur due to human factors mainly, for instance, when professionals forget to check the expiration date of a drug. Meanwhile, the system will suggest which pharmaceutical is better for the patient and ensure it is not expired.",
    "It was genuinely surprising to read Gerai’s account about the Dayak community, as it seems to represent an almost utopian view on sex and gender. Unlike Western perspectives that seek to distinguish the two genders, and raise one up at the expense of the other in some ways, the Dayak recognize the differences but see it as a benefit. Reading the account, it almost seemed as the culture promotes the empowerement of both genders based on the characteristics which define them (i.e., male strength, female persistence). These positives are then brought together to contribute to the wellbeing of society as well as personal relationships in a nearly egalitarian perspectives. It is difficult to believe, although greatly comforting to know that there are cultures as this. Unfortunately, most industrialized societies have the culture of severe gender clashes, and the characteristics of the gender are associated with negative aspects, such as Gerai notes, male strength is connected to aggression. I think it is correct to note that it is a matter of values, the values that are taught by society are the ones that people would exhibit. Western society gives value to hypermasculinity and aggression as definitions of males, exemplified via the genitalia and abusive actions such as sexual domination, assault or rape – therefore, the culture forms around this, being far removed from the egalitarianism and harmony of the Dayak. As shocking as that perspective may be, I agree that it reflects accurately the social element that has been created conservatively around rape for centuries. As mentioned earlier, rape is often attributed to natural biology, while in reality it reflects more the concepts of society. I think this perspective touches on both, it emphasizes the natural characteristics of the genders (strength for men, femininity for women) while highlighting its social features (men are praised, women are viewed as used and broken). It can be argued that it is built within our society, as there are certain connotations and stereotypes associated with sexual violence. For example, in a UK study, the label victim was associated with passive femininity. The feminization hypothesis holds true when it comes to rape, as victims, that are most commonly women (but can be men) are attributed feminine characteristics and greater judgment (men would not be seen as men anymore). Meanwhile the accused of committing the rape is given trait dimension of prescriptive masculinity.",
    "With thrombosis of the lower extremities’ veins, blood clots or blood clots form cavities, which interfere with the normal movement of blood. Over time, they can clog the venous lumen and even come off, ending in the heart, lungs, and other organs (Dalen, 2016). Unfortunately, it is often impossible to timely determine the initial symptoms of thrombosis of the leg vessels. However, if the skin changes color and swelling occurs where the blood clot is located, these are signs of vascular disease. When thrombosis progresses, its symptoms appear: acute pain and heaviness in the patient’s legs. These symptoms are provoked by the venous congestion below the site of thrombosis. The main causes of the disease’s development are blood clotting and damage to the vein wall (Thachil & Bagot, 2018). In addition, long journeys and old age exacerbate the risk of serious problems. It is also possible that the patient is taking medications that increase blood clotting, so it is necessary to ask him about this to be sure of the diagnosis. Ways to make an accurate diagnosis include duplex scanning, radiopaque phlebography, MRI, or CT. The combination of these methods will most accurately determine the severity and nature of the disease. After that, a doctor can prescribe a suitable treatment. Of the drugs, it can be injections of heparin and capsules of anticoagulants. If these methods do not help, then thrombolysis is necessary, which promotes resorption of blood clots. With the most severe outcome, surgery will be required. Undoubtedly, this is the last thing to do since it is always important to use all the other methods before making it. It may also be dangerous in the age of the considered patient. Thus, it is vital to use other methods and try to avoid any harmful consequences. Not only this will help cure thrombosis, but also save patient’s life.",
    "A Western scholarship has distorted the long history of African culture for centuries, and many of its basic principles have been viewed through the lens of colonization. As a result, the ideas and tenets of African philosophy have been appropriated and changed in value from the inherent parts of people’s nature into commodities. In their works, p’Bitek and Marimba discuss such concepts as culture, spirituality, and philosophy of African nations and how Western ideology has reshaped their presentation without fully understanding their meaning. The commodification of African culture and the imposition of European views on the distinction between culture and philosophy, religion and spirituality have disrupted African people’s ability to self-identify. The ideas by scholars show that African culture does not distinguish itself from philosophy or drive a line between reality and the spiritual nature of one’s being. European culture is presented as pragmatical and commodifying – it turns pieces of life that are meant to be used into objects for observation. p’Bitek writes that culture turns from “the way of life of a people” into “something that is bought and sold” (“What is Culture?” 14). As a result, younger generations of Africans, especially those living in Western countries, see their culture as a collection of souvenirs, not parts of everyday life. At the same time, they are subjected to the Western religions praising poverty and individualism (p’Bitek, “Man Born Unfree” 21). Ani notes that African-Americans suffer as they do not feel connected enough to traditional African society but feel a divide between themselves and European identity (49). Such disconnect leads to people losing their communal and generational identification. The readings discussed above show that African and European ideologies clash in many ways, and the latter assumes control over the presentation of the former. As a result, generations of people are removed from their culture, losing it or seeing through the distorted lens of commodification. African culture is inherently linked to philosophy, spirituality, living in the moment, and seeing the richness of life. However, it is turned into a tourist attraction, and its people are forced to perceive it through the eyes of foreigners, losing their inherent link to history and nature.",
    "In a narrow sense, the “zero-sum story” is a belief that there is a competition between racial groups, and any progress for one group is a threat to the resources and position of another (McGhee). This story is the mainstream paradigm for conservative media and has been told in different forms for years. The negative impacts of the “zero-sum” paradigm on the United States are massive and diverse. This mindset created additional economic, political, and social costs for all citizens of the United States. One of the prominent examples demonstrated by McGhee is the history of public swimming pools in cities across the US. At the beginning of the 20th century, there were massive public swimming pools in many US cities, yet at that time “public” mostly meant “white only” pools. After numerous drowning incidents, local municipalities were told to open the pools for all people regardless of their race, which provoked a backlash from the white residents. As a result, cities preferred to close or privatize the public facilities instead of allowing people of different races to use them freely. This is an example of the destruction of public goods and a massive cost increase for the whole population due to the “zero-sum” mindset. Another negative example demonstrated by McGhee is political in nature – many white people stopped pushing for social governmental policies regarding jobs and social benefits after the Black community joined the agenda. In the end, this means less social justice and social benefits for the whole country because the adherents of the “zero-sum” paradigm do not want other races to benefit from these policies. The arguments provided by McGhee seem reasonable and fair to me – they describe the past and current state of affairs in the United States well. The main reason I think so is the factual and statistical support of her position – it is very hard to argue that the US has significant social and economic problems due to racism.",
    "Diabetes of type 1 usually develops due to autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells in genetically predisposed individuals. The damage to beta cells occurs at a subclinical level for months or years in the form of insulitis. Patients with insulin deficiency cannot process glucose in peripheral muscle and fat tissues. This stimulates the secretion of antagonistic hormones such as glucagon, adrenaline, cortisol, and growth hormone (Lee et al., 2019). These antagonistic hormones, particularly glucagon, promote gluconeogenesis, glycogenolysis, and ketogenesis in the liver. Consequently, patients experience hyperglycemia and an anionic metabolic acidosis gap. Type 2 diabetes is the most frequently encountered pathology of the endocrine system organs. The core mechanism of disease development is insulin resistance (Lee et al., 2019). It is a decrease in the biological response of cells to one or more effects of insulin at its average concentration in the blood. Insulin resistance produces the inability of insulin-dependent tissues to absorb blood plasma glucose and disrupts glycogen synthesis in the hepatic. Persons with diabetes should eat according to a structured regimen and receive their medications with meals. For type 1 diabetes, a recommended diet includes carbohydrates from fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and skim milk. Patients with type 2 diabetes, complex carbohydrates such as brown rice, whole wheat, fruits, vegetables, and beans should be included in the rations (Sinclair et al., 2019). At the same time, for both types of disease should be avoided, consumption of simple carbohydrates such as sugar, pasta, white bread, flour, cookies, pastries. During the first type of diabetes, insulin Degludec (Tresiba) is required together with the diet. It is suitable to confound hypoglycemia in patients over 18 years of age. In addition, Zynquista is an oral medication intended to be combined with insulin (Sinclair et al., 2019). Besides, individuals with type 2 diabetes may require insulin if their diet plan, weight loss, exercise, and anti-diabetic medications are not achieving their target blood glucose levels. In that case, Insulin Degludec may also be appropriate; the oral drug is Metformin.",
    "The healthcare industry typically draws sufficient attention to patients’ education, especially when it comes to representatives of minority groups. That is why the article by McCurley et al. (2017) offers valuable information. The researchers demonstrate that Hispanic individuals deal with improved diabetes prevention when they participate in individual and group face-to-face sessions (McCurley et al., 2017). I believe that there is an apparent reason why such positive outcomes are achieved. It seems that face-to-face interventions are effective because patients have an opportunity to ask questions if they require explanations. Simultaneously, such educational sessions demonstrate that a patient is not unique with such a health issue. As a result, such interventions can improve people’s morale, which, in turn, will lead to increased motivation to take preventive measures and protect health. This information allows for supposing that face-to-face interventions can be suitable to my practicum project that considers measures to improve access to care among African Americans with heart failure diseases. However, the focus on patients’ cultural backgrounds should not lead to ignoring a broader context. This statement refers to the findings by Cajiita et al. (2017), who stipulate that the use of mobile technology in healthcare (mHealth) can promote better knowledge. These scholars focused on 129 older adults, and almost 25% were African Americans, to analyze whether mHealth leads to improved care (Cajiita et al., 2017). The use of mobile technologies can be as effective as face-to-face interventions because modern people spend more time online. That is why it is reasonable to rely on mHealth opportunities to improve access to care among African Americans. Finally, it is possible to suggest that combining mobile technologies and face-to-face educational sessions can result in the best outcomes.",
    "In order to prevent heart disease, cancer, and diabetes, people are required to adhere to strict routines, including in terms of diet. According to American Heart Association, people wishing to prevent heart disease must consume food which does not contain added sugars and high volumes of sodium, as well as saturated and trans fats (“Staple Ingredients”). Additionally, individuals need to eat whole grains, vegetables including frozen and canned ones, nuts, seeds, and meat such as chicken and lean beef. American Cancer Society’s dietary recommendations to people include the need to consume more fruits and vegetables, especially dark green and orange ones, since they have a considerable cancer prevention capacity (“American Cancer Society”). Moreover, the society advises people to eat foods high in fiber, such as legumes and whole grains, while avoiding red meats and added sugar. Finally, American Diabetes Association recommends eating more non-starchy vegetables, including broccoli, carrots, cauliflower which need to constitute one-half of each meal (“Eat Good”). The association also highlights the significance of consuming foods high in protein, such as beans, hummus, and lentils, as well as fruits and monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats. The recommendations to prevent the three previously mentioned conditions are, to a large extent, similar. Essentially, all organizations state that it is important to avoid consuming added sugar and saturated and trans fat. Additionally, people wanting to prevent heart disease, cancer, and diabetes also need to eat more fruits, vegetables, and chicken meat. At the same time, red meat is strictly prohibited for cancer patients while generally available for people with diabetes and heart disease. Individuals with diabetes should consume more non-starchy vegetables than people with the other two conditions. Finally, to prevent heart disease, people must particularly be careful about consuming any type of fats.",
    "One is watching the news or reading the latest article from Forbes, and you see the terms “business” and “economics” used interchangeably; one may wonder about the differences. Business and economics are similar in that they are supplements to each other, both dealing with the process of creating products and services and selling them to generate output. These are fields of study that are closely related and include a range of shared subtopics, such as enterprises, marketing, finance, manufacturing, and banking. Both are social sciences that focus on financial measurement and analysis, focusing on variables that impact the market and also focus on short- and long-term projections, as well as the inner workings of various industries. Finally, both business and economics tend to focus on various problems facing the nation, its citizens, government, and private enterprises (Vaidya). However, there are some differences between economics and business, which are based on their conceptual purpose. Economics is a study focusing on understanding human behavior and, in turn, how that reflects on the broader economic elements of whole nations. Meanwhile, business is aimed at studying the process of the exchange of goods and money specifically, and all the related elements starting from production to the final sale, and how a specific enterprise fulfills this process. It can be argued that business is a subset of economics, as the human behavior in that exchange of goods is a point of focus (Casson). A major difference is in concepts, economics deals with theories and broad elements of the economy, such as supply and demand, interest rate, and international trade. While these undoubtedly impact business, both individual entities and as a field of study, business focuses on the process of wealth creation within the context of the economy and typically applies practical theories. Economics focuses on and attempts to maximize the welfare of society, while business is centered on its shareholders. Both face different issues, with economics encompassing poverty, unemployment, taxation, and federal expenditure, while business focuses on product positioning and differentiation, marketing, growth or lack thereof of profitability, and individual or industry performance (Gitman et al.). While business and economics share many commonalities, their conceptual and practical differences make them distinct sciences.",
    "The difference between a doctor approaching a patient in comparison with nursing practice on the same subject can be an excellent topic due to the highlighted features that are emphasized when parallel. Thus, medical practice using one’s physiological status while nursing also implementing psychological responses is an effective way in making the difference between the two clear while operating based on PICOT. The points to be included are the difference in the research approach. Since medical practice is more objective due to the fact that it relies on specific outcomes and facts, the research is quantitative. On the other hand, the PICOT question included in the nursing practice implies mixed research that considers both opinions and data. Topic presents the differentiation between nursing and medical practice in terms of approach to diagnosis. The vital factor that is being brought up is the PICOT in relation to lab results versus assessment based on symptoms. The research can highlight the outcomes in terms of the accuracy of the findings while focusing on the comparison between the two concepts. The aspect that illustrates its importance is the overall parallel between the two models that may have similar results depending on how the research will be conducted and its findings. The potential research focusing on the nursing practice of preventing certain injuries and providing more patient-centered and personalized care can emphasize the importance of decision-making in the field. Decision-making is an essential concept in the nursing care field (Nibbelink & Brewer, 2018). Hence, a PICOT question on the topic of providing specialized care in terms of preventing falls versus solely treating them can be an effective way of discussing nursing from a personalized perspective.",
    "A digital engagement policy determines how the organization intends to position itself online. The regulation also covers the company’s brand qualities and its vision and mission objectives. It also directs how employees can communicate digitally, both internally and externally, with suppliers and clients (Brown, 2019). In addition, the above guidelines also target social media interaction practices that may affect the business, either negatively or positively. Our organization has a digital engagement policy that it utilizes to protect the reputation of its brand. Moreover, the above strategy has enabled the business to increase employees’ commitment while boosting the levels of their obligation. Hence, workers share more about the organization online, thus, contributing to more sales and profit. Additionally, with the above rules in place, the firm’s private information is secure since it is not shared online. My professional presence online is aligned with the organization because it entails displaying the company’s products and services and connecting with all stakeholders. My existence online builds a good relationship with clients, friends, and followers, which is advantageous to the business since the company image has improved. This has helped the organization become relevant because it has offered its clients a ‘human face.’ I use media platforms to promote my brand by focusing on different social networks. I also create informative and engaging content about the company’s products and ensure all the information is up-to-date and accurate before uploading. It is critical to do regular online marketing while avoiding over-posting not to look desperate. All the updates of accomplishments and newsworthy developments are done 3 to 4 times a week. The topics that I frequently post on social media to market my brand are about the pricing of the products. I also emphasize the benefits of using our merchandise and services while comparing with others in the market. I always comment more on the developments and accomplishments achieved but avoid posting any negative comments made by an individual or a dissatisfied customer because this could cause a destructive online discussion, which may diminish the brand. After completing the course, I plan to change how to respond to any negativity, and I will not ignore any undesirable feedback because it enlightens me about the buyer’s experience. In addition, I will also start to market strategically, for instance, to develop a procedure of targeting my audience depending on the social media network, have schedules for my content, and change the communication methods.",
    "The case under consideration, Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S., was significant for developing measures to avoid discrimination in the workplace. More specifically, it was primarily related to diversity in terms of sex and age since this combination frequently evokes the concerns of the population (King, 2021). The examination of the issue by relying on the example of Gerald Bostock was advantageous for establishing proper employment practices in this respect. In this lawsuit filed by the plaintiff, the main factor was his unjustified dismissal from the company in which he had otherwise positive reputation. This event was caused by the man’s interest in a gay softball league which he expressed while being in the workplace while neglecting the provisions of Title VII (Mallory et al., 2020). This part of the Civil Rights Act, confirming the violation, was relied on by Bostock when initiating legal action, but it was initially dismissed by the district court due to its allegedly erroneous interpretation (“Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S.,” 2019). The appeal, including the claim to include sexual discrimination in consideration, was successful as Bostock managed to support his position with the opposing statements of Massachusetts law, Chapter 151B (“Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S.,” 2019). In this way, the meaning of the previously used provisions regulating such cases was modified accordingly. To summarize, the examined court case based on employment law and, more specifically, discrimination against workers happened to be crucial for making adjustments. The previous evidence, as per Title VII of the Civil Rights Act did not include the particular considerations of sex and age. Hence, this gap was compensated for by this decision, and the consequent change in the legal provisions helped guarantee the equality of people in the workplace in the context of their diversity.",
    "There are several types of fake news, ranging from apparent articles to more subtle kinds of deception. People frequently rely on critical decisions on what they read in the news, such as how to vote in elections or what therapy to provide when they are sick. This is why it is critical to have trustworthy news. When individuals can’t identify the difference between true and fake news, critical social and political issues get muddled and misunderstood. A lot of false news is created with the intent of inflaming and exacerbating societal disputes. Most significantly, critical thinking is required while posting or researching on a certain issue, writing comments, and engaging in other social media activities. Many fake news articles are constructed in such a way as to elicit strong emotional responses such as fear or wrath. As a result, critical thinking and research are essential. It’s crucial to examine a few choices when spotting disinformation, recognizing fake news sites, and double-checking before sharing or posting a comment. First and foremost, double-check the source of the news or information. Fake news sites frequently employ addresses that sound like legitimate newspaper locations, but they lack authentic stories on various themes. If the website appears to be unsteady, go to the “About” page and seek a detailed description of the company. Second, look into the author. Check them out to see whether they’re reliable – do they have a strong reputation, and do they write about their field of expertise? Furthermore, the motivation of the author may be essential in the dissemination of forgeries. Third, fact-checking is necessary since trustworthy news reports will include numerous facts such as data, figures, and expert statements. If they aren’t there, inquire as to why. Reports containing misleading information sometimes contain wrong dates or time periods, so it’s a good idea to double-check the article’s publication date.",
    "Geographical distribution and location Banana is a popular fruit crop that grows all over the world and has several health advantages. Bananas are particularly significant in several low-income, food-insecure, least developed nations, where they may help with both household food security and revenue-generating as a cash crop. The crop is a key export item for a number of agricultural nations, and it is Africa’s, Asia’s, and Latin America’s biggest fruit crop in terms of production and commerce (MacKinnon & Cumbers, 2019). Bananas from Central and South America, as well as the Philippines, account for more than 90% of all exports (MacKinnon & Cumbers, 2019). The EU, the USA, China, Russia, and Japan are the top importers (MacKinnon & Cumbers, 2019). Banana output worldwide is projected to be 130 million tons per year (MacKinnon & Cumbers, 2019). Approximately 87 percent of bananas produced in the globe are consumed by farmers or sold in local marketplaces. Almost a third of it is farmed in Sub-Saharan Africa, where it meets more than 25% of the dietary energy requirements of over 100 million people (MacKinnon & Cumbers, 2019). East Africa produces and consumes the majority of bananas in Africa. Spatial Distribution Large supply growth in top exporting nations Ecuador and the Philippines, as well as strong rises in import demand, particularly from China and the European Union, are key drivers of trade (MacKinnon & Cumbers, 2019). Large retail chains from key importing nations are now operating directly in the global banana value chain. These networks buy bananas directly from growers and distributors rather than via typical fruit corporations (MacKinnon & Cumbers, 2019). The intricate web of interactions involved in the production, distribution, and trade of any given commodity may lead to genuine conflicts of interest among groups of individuals over who benefits the most from a product. Cheap bananas are frequently passed on to small farmers and plantation employees down the supply chain, resulting in lower salaries and working conditions (MacKinnon & Cumbers, 2019). Currently, the main issue in terms of spatial distribution is that large-scale banana production may negatively affect the environment, worker health and safety, and local populations. This occurs due to the frequently harsh techniques employed to regulate irrigation and plant diseases. Sources MacKinnon, D., & Cumbers, A. (2019). An introduction to economic geography .

    "Making Budgetary Control Effective A robust organizational structure is required for budgetary effectiveness. Permanent specific concerns, such as a finance committee and a budget director, should be established. To avoid bottlenecks, budget planning must be well integrated. Budgets for individuals should be harmonized with each other. Budgets must be reviewed on a regular basis to avoid them from devolving into a license to spend the entire authorized amount even when it is not necessary. According to Dauda (2019), “business organizations of all types must engage in financial planning at whatever level to ensure judicious deployment of resources for achieving organisational goals.” Workers should be appropriately compensated for performance in accordance with the budget. Sloppy staff, on the other hand, should not go condemned. Behavioral Aspects of Budgetary Control Budgetary control is a crucial instrument for performance evaluation. Nevertheless, findings take time to appear. Those in charge of fiscal control should have extensive knowledge and expertise in the subject. Workers are modifying their working practices, routines, and even their inter-relationships based on finances. As a result, workers may exhibit reluctance to change. It leads to the creation of each budget with the backing of top leadership. Each employee’s requirements are fully described and distributed in a formal structure. If this is the case, they will be aware of their power and responsibilities, which will be valuable for budgetary management. A financial management program’s effectiveness depends on the organization’s defined objectives. As a result, when establishing targets, management should exercise caution. Furthermore, the aims are explicit.",
    "Gendered behavior denotes fundamental expressions of gender socialization and identity through an individual’s various developmental phases. Thus, gendered behaviors refer to the ways persons behave according to their respective male or female genders (Au & Rudolfsdottir, 2021). One of the prominent gendered behaviors instilled in me during childhood was that women are the primary cooks in the home. Hence, from childhood, I learned how to prepare food for the family, unlike most male relatives around. Even the movies mostly depicted women as the cooks in the home. Perhaps the gendered role that I quickly adopted/ accepted from childhood was the idea that women are natural caregivers. The function depicted women as noble people who consider the plight of others in the home and society and consistently seek to alleviate suffering. Women are warm, nurturing, and caring. Thus, many regarded professions that require empathy like nursing and teaching to the women’s domain. The idea that women are more humane and caring appealed to me and caused me to accept the role. In my mind, the part admitted what many would prefer to ignore/ deny: women play critical roles in retaining sanity in the world. For me, the role meant that women could play vital functions in stemming the tide of oppression, suffering, and cruelty evident even from childhood. Therefore, the idea that women are more caring and naturally nurturing appealed to me because it placed the gender on a nobler pedestal. Despite the perceived nobility of the gendered role that women are more nurturing and caring, specific adverse consequences emerged regarding employment opportunities, as previously highlighted. In many ways, many subsequently considered women to be unfit for specific job descriptions like piloting, engineering, and doctors, which were better paying (Samidha, 2019). On the other hand, societies restricted women to courses like nursing and teaching. Most patients assume women caregivers to be nurses rather than doctors in the care centers. Hence, the role may cause conflicts when deciding on career opportunities.",
    "A lot of historical events and time periods have specific names. The renaissance, the enlightenment, the stone age – all of these were called such for a particular reason, and signify a way to differentiate one era from another. One prime example of that trend is the industrial revolution. Also called the industrialization, it was an important part of history and a big step in both technological and social development. Happening at a never-before seen speed, the process has begun and ended in less than a 100 years. The word “revolution” in “industrial revolution” is used to emphasize that fact, and note that the process is regarded as both an extreme and quick advancement in society ( Industrial revolution ). Like a real revolution, it also had a variety of effects on people and their lives. By changing the way work is performed and understood, it fundamentally shifted the people’s understanding of the economy, labor, and the world itself, driving both positive and negative change. For entrepreneurs and people starting their own businesses, the industrialization became a central source of focus and income, replacing the manual labor of people. It also created opportunities for new types of production and large scale manufacturing to be performed. The introduction of complex machinery profoundly affected the workers as well, driving the unskilled labor out of fashion and requiring a higher degree of both education and proficiency. Industrial revolution has made many lose their jobs, while a number of other people have gained new possibilities of employment via migrating into cities (Thompson). Industrialization drove urban development, and contributed to the establishment of the city as a central hub for human interaction. On a larger scale, the ability to mass produce goods and services has allowed countries to establish larger economies, expand trade, and start more thorough relationships with their neighbors. Overall, the industrialization age has had its ups and downs, but the significance of the process is hard to overlook, as it remains the basis for the society people see today.",
    "Miranda warning, also known as Miranda rights, is a formal statement in which a person being arrested is informed of their basic civil rights under the jurisdiction of the United States. Through this warning, an officer of the law enforcement notifies the individual of their right to remain silent, as well as to an attorney. Such principles reflect the foundation of the legal system of the United States, in which both sides are protected by a comprehensive set of rights in order to eliminate bias and enable an objective investigation of the case. The obligatory nature of the warning serves the interests of both sides of the process. First of all, the person being detained possesses an inherent set of rights, which must be respected within the framework of the court of law. They are guaranteed by the United States Constitution, and depriving a person of them would be a major violation of this fundamental law. Rogers and Drogin (2019) state that it would be a misconception to believe that every resident is fully informed of their rights by default. Furthermore, a failure to provide a notification of rights may render the defendant’s testimony inadmissible in court, as it can be dismissed due to possible coercion. This way, Miranda warnings align with the interests of both defendants and prosecutors. On the other hand, it appears possible to argue for the redundancy of rights in some special cases. For example, the arrest of a dangerous criminal or a person responsible for major terrorist threats is often deemed as not requiring a Miranda warning. In such cases, the situation may develop in a matter of seconds, making it necessary to incapacitate the perpetrator before starting legal procedures. From this perspective, it may be contextually appropriate to postpone Miranda warnings until the public safety is secured. In other words, the possibility of a direct, immediate threat to people’s lives outweighs legal formalities (Rogers & Drogin, 2019). Nevertheless, Miranda warnings should not be ignored completely, as they form the core of a transparent trial. Therefore, even if they are not presented at the moment of an arrest, Miranda rights will be given later once the situation is secured and prior to launching formal legal procedures.",
    "The doctor’s job is to follow ethical standards, including loyalty to patients and respect for their choice. However, the profession concentrates on philosophical, religious, and cultural traditions and beliefs. Physician-assisted suicide can be seen as voluntary death by a medical professional. At the same time, the doctor provides all the necessary means and information regarding the patient’s desires for the end of life. However, such cooperation on the part of a doctor cannot be ethically conditioned. Allowing euthanasia can cause irreparable harm to the patient if done incorrectly. Thus, a person can be left without the possibility of a habitual existence. Even though many patients who decide to die to suffer from incurable diseases voluntarily, the doctor cannot assist them. In this case, the moral commandment that a person cannot take someone else’s life is violated (Clarke et al., 2021). Moreover, doctor-assisted suicide is wholly opposed to the definition of a profession aimed at helping people. The doctor is seen as a healer, while physician-assisted suicide does not seem to control and calculate the risks, which can be a threat to many patients. The dilemma lies in the Hippocratic oath given by all doctors, one of the points of which is not to harm. Thus, helping a patient with a death wish can be seen as a deliberate wish to injure the person. Moreover, it may reduce the level of trust between patients and medical staff since taking a life cannot be ethically justified. In addition, the religious view forbids doctors to help patients at the end of life, referring to the commandment not to kill a person. Furthermore, killing may be considered offensive due to society’s moral attitude. The patient’s pain can be alleviated with the help of available medicines, while the loss of life is an irreversible action.",
    "The project aims to explore the questions behind people’s sexual orientation identification and the reasons behind it. Some people consider sexuality a subject of choice; others argue that the environment cannot dictate a person what sex attracts them. The latter group proceeds with the argument that sexuality is determined biologically, making it an aspect of one’s identity, which should be protected by the government (Sheldon et al., 2017). To further explore people’s perspectives on the matter, the project’s topic can be phrased as the following research question: does the environment affect people’s sexual orientation? While exploring the subject of the research, the following dependant and independent variables related to the topic were identified with the help of the GSS database. The dependent variable is sexort, which stands for respondent’s sexual orientation. The question related to this variable is: which of the following best describes you? This variable was chosen due to the fact that it allows determining what environment has surrounded the respondent. The independent variable related to the topic of the project is sexbirth, which stands for the sex assigned at birth. The GSS question for this variable is: What sex were you assigned at birth (for example, on your birth certificate)? The sexbirth variable was chosen since it is necessary to identify respondents’ sexuality and homosexual individuals for the research. There is an essential correlation between the two variables that can facilitate the project’s research. People’s sex identification significantly affects their lives and experiences. For example, the environments surrounding a male and a female can differ critically. As a result, such differences in the environment’s impact can affect people’s identification with sexual orientation.",
    "One of the main purposes of a leader of a business is to select the best course of action out of the available alternatives when it comes to the process of decision-making. Clearly enough, it is impossible without a thorough understanding of a company’s business environment. When it comes to entering the market with the goods for the purchasers’ consumption, the one theory that specialists often take to is the supply and demand theory. This theory is utilized to understand the customers’ buying behaviors and help managers strategize the product in the market in accordance with them. For instance, a lack of demand for the product signifies that supply needs to be shortened – and vice versa: when there is an increase of demand, it is reasonable to enhance supply of goods as well. Additionally, a supply and demand analysis helps in pricing: if the demand for the product is high, buyers are more likely to accept price increases an keep on purchasing it. With the low demand, however, prices should be sufficiently affordable; otherwise, the producer will suffer losses. There are various strategies to make the supply and demand model work to one’s advantage. Dayton cites an example of De Beers – a company specializing in creating diamond jewelry. Their vaults are filled with diamonds – but they manage to maintain high prices for gems by limiting supply. Thus, diamonds keep staying a rare commodity, for the acquisition of which as a status symbol purchasers willingly pay. Another organization using the supply and demand theory to their advantage is Zappo. Dayton states that the company’s primary idea of selling shoes online – that is, with no option of trying them on beforehand – did not seem like a good one. However, Zappo became a success story by having gained control over supply – their enormous assortment, excellent customer service, and a favorable return policy make buyers choose them time and time again. Finally, there is Apple – a renowned giant of the technology market. Their building of anticipation for the release of a service or a product is a manufacturing demand that makes purchasers feel like they are a part of something bigger than simply another gadget’s market entry. In conclusion, a supply and demand theory can definitely be used as a tool for navigating the market – one only has to search for appropriate ways to use it to their product’s advantage.",
    "The influence of social networks is increasing, pushing traditional media to second place. In particular, Twitter platform has become an influential tool for obtaining current information and even conducting debates on various topics. However, tweets can also be different and may or not impact society. This paper examines the Australian politician Bill Shorten’s tweet concerning the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS). Although the politician reports a joyful event in his message, he also expressed regrets about the current policy, limiting the NDIS activity. This tweet is meant to be both informative and grievance. At the same time, the author reports that the girl received assistance thanks to NDIS funding but also regrets that this was possible only after public coverage of the situation. As a result, Shorten deplores the current policy of the Australian government because of which NDIS has limited capacity to help people. While his tweet simultaneously has both negative and positive messages, it can have a positive impact. Criticism from an influential politician can draw attention to the problem and call on society and government to solve it. Several signs indicate the impact of the investigated tweet is. According to Casero-Ripollés (2020), activity, popularity, and authority are the main signs of influence. This post received 209 retweets, 50 comments, and 858 likes – such activity for a poorly discussed topic is quite a significant influence. However, the popularity of the issue is low, and in relation to the population of Australia, such indicators are small. Assessing authority, one can say that Shorten as a politician, is aware and concerned about the topic and has experience and knowledge to express an authoritative opinion. Thus, the tweet may be influential in discussing the activities of NDIS but not on the national scale.",
    "There is a growing number of physicians’ encounters with the victims of human trafficking, sometimes even without recognizing them as such. Recently, Todres (2017) reported an incident, where Dr. W was requested to screen the women-employees of such a firm for sexually transmitted infections. On the one hand, according to the Code of Medical Ethics of the American Medical Association (2011), it is necessary to safeguard patient confidentiality, including several aspects, such as physical, informational, decisional, and associational privacy. At the same time, it is obligatory to keep the records of all the patients in the healthcare settings while Dr. W was asked not to maintain them to avoid possible arrest of these women. Thus, the doctor understood that in another case, the employees of this firm would not have a chance for diligent healthcare and, moreover, could possibly spread the STIs further. The case engages issues in several fields, such as criminal law, ethical concerns, human rights, and service provider regulations. From the side of conspiracy law, it is possible to assume that the agreement of Dr. W is equal to the participation in the crime. As she is aware of the crime and did not report it but helped in its realization, the court’s decision can be not in her favor. From the point of view of human rights, prostitution is illegal in the US. Even more, if the minors are employed in the firm, the case falls under the mandatory reported law (Todres, 2016). Ethical considerations here also imply helping a child by breaching confidentiality. To conclude, the decision in the case of an encounter with human trafficking should be equivocal. By facilitating the activity of an enterprise engaged with human trafficking, a physician is partly responsible for the crimes and exploitation of women and children. Therefore, following the legal frameworks and ethical considerations, such cases should be reported.",
    "Feminist ethics is founded on the views that women’s subordination is morally inappropriate and that women’s moral experiences are as valuable as men’s. Vaughn (2019) states that the following are the practical aims of feminist ethics. Firstly, feminist ethics express moral critiques of behaviors and attitudes that reinforce women’s rights. Consequently, the vital goal is to provide morally reasonable means to oppose such behaviors and practices. Ultimately, feminist ethics’ objective is to imagine a morally good alternative that promotes female empowerment. Feminist ethical argument resurfaced in the late 1960s, first among the general public and then in academic discourse, as part of a broader rebirth of feminist ethical questions. On issues like abortion, fairness and equality, domestic work, sexual violence, and obligatory heterosexuality, the first academic feminist ideas were expressed. Nonetheless, the term ‘feminist ethics’ did not become widely used until the late 1970s or early 1980s (Vaughn, 2019). Traditional ethics, feminists speculated, was more thoroughly male-biased and required more radical reconsideration. Moreover, feminism is continuously engaged in ethical thought and discussion. According to Vaughn (2019), feminism is primarily a normative viewpoint, and feminists themselves regularly challenge its meaning. Lack of care for women’s interests, disregard for women’s concerns, rejection of women’s moral agency, devaluation of feminine ideals, and depreciation of women’s experience are all manifestations of feminist obstacles. Putting women’s interests first, considering women as ethical experts or authorities, exchanging male for female values, or extrapolating directly from women’s moral experience are all illustrations of how feminist ethics has been stereotyped and viewed. Essentially, these stereotypes are widespread and inaccurate; feminist ethics is significantly more extensive and more open than the misinterpretations suggest. To summarize, modern feminists are experimenting with new methods of thinking about moral themes that are attentive to their specific particularity and inherent shared worth, such as shared humanity, fairness, and impartiality.",
    "The concepts of domestic violence and abuse refer to psychologically or physically aggressive behavior of one family member towards another. This aggression could take the form of beating, rape, screaming, and humiliation. Unfortunately, in the modern world, these are common phenomena. According to statics provided by Huecker et al. (2021), 10 million Americans per year suffer from violence and abuse. The victims of domestic violence and abuse feel depressed and helpless, and their self-esteem is also extremely low. Fear of the aggressor might force a victim to keep calm about the experience of being abused. Nonetheless, there are signs via which a provider could suspect domestic violence, child abuse, or elder abuse. If a woman arrives at the emergency room with bruises or fractures that do not as she slipped on the wet floor, a nurse could suspect that her partner beats her. In addition to that, victims are highly likely to be depressed and anxious even though they might try to hide these emotions (Lloyd, 2018). A provider has a reason to be concerned with child abuse if a young patient is underweighted without objective reason and is afraid of other adults. In addition to that, a child might get severely scared with a loud sound or sudden movement. As for older adults, a nurse could suspect abuse if they have bruises, broken glasses, or walking stick, show signs of depression, and fails to take medications properly. Another warning sign is the refusal of a caregiver to leave an older person alone with a nurse. Undoubtedly, caregivers might not be willing to leave in some cases because they worry about missing information on an older adults health. However, a strict refusal to follow the requests of the medical staff and negotiate is a bad sign. In every health facility, a nurse who notices the signs of abuse and domestic violence must report them to the relevant authorities. More precisely, in the case of child abuse, medical staff contacts social services via hotlines or a written statement. The fact of elder abuse should be reported to the agencies on adult protective services. Finally, a nurse should inform the local law enforcement of the case of domestic violence. Still, before informing the related agencies, a nurse should discuss the case with a physician or a nurse practitioner and exam the patient without the potential abuser in the room.",
    "Introduction The fashion industry is one of the most dynamic sectors around the globe, and the dynamism arises from the diverse needs of the client base. Fashion is a personal statement and a symbol of societal status that also defines a person’s culture and individuality. As a result, clients are always curious about fashionable pieces that serve several factors while maintaining a particular budget. Although many clothes stores stock a variety of fashionable clothes, they do not capture the clients’ personality and individual needs because the designs are premade. Most stores such as Zara and H&M invest significant funds into identifying the unique needs of their clients. However, their reach in identifying these needs is not yet global, and this implies that a significant section of the target market buys what is available. Therefore, bridging the gap between what the clients want from their preferred clothes stores and what the stores are offering is crucial in promoting customer satisfaction. Our project, Be-Unique , intends to solve this problem by leveraging technology to bring the services closer to the clients. The purpose of the project is to provide a highly integrative platform through which customers can digitally access their favorite clothing stores. The platform intends to revolutionize the fashion industry by offering clients an opportunity to present their unique designs for customization. Online clothes from stores such as Zara and H&M are made using standard sizes that may not fit all body sizes within the standard measurements. Our online stores’ mandate is to ensure that clients have easy access to thigh-quality fashionable items that can be customized to fit their unique sizes. Therefore, our mandate will include offering the clients an opportunity to submit their sizes to our platform, whereby their clothes can be tailor-made to fit their unique sizes. Our highly skilled team will be on standby to take clients’ measurements and submit them to the famous clothes stores for customization.",
    "The editing in the first episode of the series Money Heist is in line with its thrilling plot and rapid action. In the first scene, as the character gets ready to exit her vehicle, the editing is quick, focusing on the items she is picking up. Similarly, the camera often focuses on objects, leading the viewer towards the items that will become an essential part of the narrative. For example, one can see the ringing phone before it is picked up. Moreover, the show uses rapid editing with close-ups and the use of objects that identify characters – guns, money, and other items that show one’s motives or their identifying trait. The characters’ close-ups are dynamic, often using dolly shots to slowly expose the background or move with the character. This way, the camera does not stop as long as the characters move or the whole room is exposed. When they stop, the editing is as rapid as the conversation between people. In monologues, the dolly is used again to keep the tension as the series requires a serious tone in many scenes dealing with life-or-death scenarios. Notably, the character in a close-up is rarely placed in the center of the screen. The shot is divided into thirds vertically – and the characters stay in the first or third part. Hand-held shots are also used, and they are consistent with scenes where characters feel insecure, aggressive, scared, or exposed. Moreover, when the characters are walking, the camera moves at the same speed. The change between steady dolly movements and hand-held “shaky” shots is needed to juxtapose moments focused on action and interpersonal drama. Moreover, tension is the primary source of emotion, and the editing keeps enough suspense by using close-ups of characters rather than an overview of the whole room.",
    "The Supreme Court ruled that Static Control’s claim of violation of the Lanham Act clause falsifying advertisement was valid. The underlying issue in the case was that the Supreme Court had to determine the meaning of the provision by applying the traditional principles of interpreting the statute (Campbell, 2020). The second issue is that labeling the claim by Static Control as a prudential standing question was misleading (Halbert & Ingulli, 2020). Lexmark bases the arguments on the prudential standing of Associated General Contractors. However, the case has strong grounds on statutory provisions that the Supreme Court had to ascertain in terms of statutory interpretation. The causes of the statute violations damage the plaintiff’s reputation since they fall within the zone of interest covered by the statute. The Supreme Court presumed that the statutory cause of action extended only to plaintiffs for whom the invoked law protects their interests. According to Bennett v. Spear, 520 U. S. 154, the span of the zone of interest varies depending on the law at issue (Tavares, 2021). The Lanham Act includes statements of purposes such as the people engaged and protection against unfair competition. Common law depicts unfair competition as causing injury to a business’s reputation or sales. The plaintiff must then show that they suffered a commercial interest injury within the zone of interest in a false-advertising suit. The Supreme Court also presumed that the statutory cause of action is limited to the plaintiff whose injuries arise from the proximate cause of the violation of the statute. For example, in the case of Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corporation, 503 U.S. 258-270, the statutory cause of action bars suits from damages that are remote from the defendant’s unlawful conduct (Jones, 2019). However, since the Lanham Act only allows commercial injury lawsuits, the proximate cause of the consumer deception is not fatal as required by the statute. The principles act as guidance than the direct-competitor test, reasonable interest by the Sixth Circuit, or multifactor balancing test recommended by Lexmark. The principle also outlines that the claims by Static Control fall under plaintiffs authorized to sue under §1125(a). Static Control can sufficiently allege that it lost sales and suffered injuries in its business reputation within the zone of interest caused by Lexmark’s misrepresentation.",
    "Marketing is one of the most critical aspects of every business, which makes organizations look for effective ways to attract new customers. However, not all marketing activities are fair or ethical, and targeting uninformed consumers is among them. One should explain that uninformed consumers are individuals who lack the psychological or mental maturity to make reasonable decisions and purchases. Examples of these people are children, the elderly, and individuals with psychological conditions. Consequently, it is unethical to target such consumers because this practice can provide these people with adverse outcomes. Many factors explain why it is unethical to target uninformed consumers. The first robust argument comes from the definition presented above. Since these people do not have psychological or mental maturity, target marketing can force them to purchase unneeded items. Consequently, this marketing approach is a form of manipulation of unprotected populations. The second reason refers to the fact that it is challenging for uninformed consumers to locate sellers’ lying. As a result, organizations can provide customers with false information to stimulate their buying behaviors. Irrespective of this information, some people claim that there is nothing wrong with targeting uninformed consumers. This point of view relies on the belief that such customers represent new markets, and organizations are free to enter and benefit from them. However, it is challenging to deny that these consumers are vulnerable populations, meaning that they deserve a specific attitude. That is why it is unethical to target uninformed customers. In conclusion, the essay has presented robust arguments of why organizations should refrain from targeting children, the elderly, and people with mental conditions. Even though some people and businesses stipulate that these populations are suitable for marketing, it is better to avoid them. The rationale behind this statement is that uninformed consumers do not have psychological maturity, meaning that target marketing can force them to make unreasonable decisions and purchases.",
    "The European powers had taken major parts of the world, including the Caribbean. In the 15 th century, the Europeans claimed the region following the establishment of Spanish settlements and conquest of the Aztec and Inca empires (Horne, 2018). Due to the conquest, it was easy for the Spanish to invade Mexico and Peru through exploration in strategic points of the Caribbean region. Following the Spanish invasion of the Caribbean in the 17th century, other European powers such as the British and French started settling in pivotal points such as the island of Tortuga and later moved to Jamaica (Horne, 2018). By mid-century, many non-Hispanic privateers had established permanent colonies and trading zones in Caribbean islands. The profitability in terms of wealth enabled rise of conquest to Caribbean region. First, it was easy to obtain gold, which was among the region’s key aspects of the scramble. The existence of Christopher Columbus in the region had shown the way for other leaders to set colonies (Horne, 2018). Second, there was the availability of a labor force drawn from the African continent as black people were used as slaves to work in the industrial openings in the area. Due to the decline of Spanish power in the region, majorly as a result of reduced native population of the area, the other European powers boosted their presence in areas that Columbus had covered. For example, Francis Drake, a privateer from England, attacked many Spanish settlements (Horne, 2018). The collaborative base between the French, British and Dutch made it possible for European powers to conquer the significant area of the Caribbean. After start of the competitive nature of colonies, sovereign battles emerged that led to stiff wars that made it hard for the Caribbean islands to unite against European rule (Horne, 2018). Because of the emergence of agricultural activities, the Atlantic slave trade saw many Africans work for the Europeans in the Caribbean, strengthening their colonialism in the area hence conquering the region significantly.",
    "Introduction Back to the Future is a unique film of its time, which has become a cult film thanks to its gripping plot and attention to detail. Screenwriter Robert Zemeckis created a movie about travel, pitting opposing personalities against each other who later became perfect partners. Thesis: Robert Zemeckis created an award-winning film that changed views on cause and effect and interactions through plot structure, character development, and setting. Body Paragraphs   * The plot structure of Back to the Future keeps the viewer interested in the film through logical cause-and-effect relationships.       + Each moment in the film is connected to the last moment and the next, weaving them into a unified structure.       + The scene begins with a ticking clock, then shifts to the theft of the plutonium and a focus on Marty, who is unaware of what was stolen under his bed.       + Marty ignores the safety of the clock tower, but later it turns out that he was around when the tower stopped.   * Character development in the story is built on the opposites of Marty and Doc, who elusively turn out to be people with similar histories.       + Marty is relatively quick and restless, though Doc seems judicious and prone to over-analyzing the situation: together, their work is coherent and efficient.       + Marty uses teenage slang while Doc uses proper speech: their different characters allow them to see the best in each other and develop as individuals.   * The film’s setting is new and unusual for the time of its creation, so the viewer’s eye is drawn to the screenwriter’s love of detail and desire to fill the film with characters from different eras.       + The differences in road construction quickly determine the time difference: in the ’50s, some were dirt roads.       + The film revisits the clock tower, which was in operation in the ’50s and stopped in the ’80s. Conclusion Back to the Future reveals to the viewer a new reality in which everything is interconnected: logical connections, people, and places. Zemeckis has created a unique story that amazes audiences with its details, developments, and shifting eras.",
    "The study showed that bibliometric analysis of evidence gathered from integrative reviews and analytical studies had substantial implications for nurse-related and evidence based policy changes. Primarily, this is possible through the use of integrative reviews in designing new programs (Benton et al., 2020). The collective database of the synthesized studies as suggested by the authors of the study, can be utilized by nurses to be empowered through evidence-based materials in the formulation of changes in universal health coverage. As such, the applicability of this information has a number of benefits for working nurses, as they will be able to employ concise and trusted resources when advocating or implementing changes to policy. I think that nursing practice can be vastly improved with the use of well-managed databases that employ evidence-based research. This is because such a database will be able to illustrate gaps in knowledge of overarching issues as well as daily medical practices in the sphere of nursing (Houser, 2016). Similarly, it allows for insight into nurse-specific fields such as nurse education, care for the lederly, emergency care, and more. Currently, accessibility to extensive and complete information that is formed through evidence-based research is limited due to a number of factors. In order to better provide such informative materials among working nurses it is essential to reduce bureaucratic processes and integrate technology into the process. Modern technology allows for low-cost and time-saving methods of information sharing, which will be largely beneficial for nursing. As mentioned prior, evidence-based research has the potential to reveal gaps in information in nurse-specific practices that would otherwise be unseen. I believe it is essential to make such knowledge accesibile and cohesive to promote better nursing care and work quality.",

    "It is a film about the fragility of masculinity, men’s mental health, and how they are interconnected. Fight Club is a crude portrait of what happens when men’s insecurities turn into masculinity in overdrive. Thus, this film represents toxic masculinity. Fight Club shows men dissatisfied with the state of masculinity. The characters are different in that many of them were raised by their mothers because their fathers either left the family or got divorced. According to Ta, the result is that the characters see themselves as “a generation of men raised by women” (270). In their life there is not enough male education for the formation of their masculinity. It confirms the idea of phallocentrism, which is based on the image of castrated women. Women raise children so that they can enter into the symbolic order. Fight Club is a wicked satire about finding, nurturing, and destroying yourself. It challenges ideas of masculinity, adding to the image of a real man several features that can be called associative and setting self-destruction and a destructive impact on society as one of life’s goals. The victory of Jack’s subpersonality over Tyler on the roof of a skyscraper shows that the good in a real man can overcome the destructive element. The ability to self-sacrifice and responsibility for his actions in Jack, who has gone through the evolution of masculinity, inspires some optimism, but the finale remains open.",
    "In the development of nursing in Europe in the 19th century, the activities of an outstanding personality, the Englishwoman Florence Nightingale, played an important role. Florence was looking for an opportunity to help the poor and the sick. At that distant time, activities related to mercy, helping those in need, were considered an occupation not worthy of a noblewoman. The young woman sacrificed personal life expensive relationships with her parents but remained faithful to her calling. Furthermore, her values and commitment allowed Florence to become a historical figure in modern nursing, to whose leadership people owe accolades for paving the way of nursing’s place in our societies. Thanks to perseverance and perseverance, in 1851, Florence entered the community of the sisters of pastor F. Flender in Germany, where she received a nursing education. Subsequently, Florence made a considerable contribution not only to the treatment of cholera help in wars but to the development of leadership and the reformation of nursing (Kim, 2020) The selfless woman became an example of service to people and a prototype of international mercy. Moreover, Florence managed to change a common thought about nobility of nursing, her leadership allowed to reestablish pivotal understanding of nursing practice. Her significance can easily be depicted on a medal with her image, which is awarded for special merits to distinguished nurses. A large role in the development of nursing abroad belongs to the international society of the Red Cross. The International Committee for Relief of the Wounded, headed by A. Dunant, convened a conference in Geneva in October 1863 with the participation of representatives of 13 countries, at which the charter of the International Organization of the Red Cross was developed, and the emblem of the society was adopted. The United States achieved tremendous success in the development of nursing in the 19th-20th centuries, when the American Medical Association was first established. (AMA) (Kim, 2020) In 1873, the first three nursing schools were opened in the USA according to the model of the F. Nightingale schools in London (Kim, 2020) Thus, the further formation of international humanitarian organizations was also primarily made possible by leaders such as Florence.",
    "Diana Kendall claims the current perception of the class has been a construct of the media and based on the construction, the meaning of class is determined. Kendall argues that the media has legitimized inequality in the United States through the assumption, with television programs and newspaper articles creating and reifying class-based stereotypes. Furthermore, Kendall argues that class discussions in the media are rarely explicit; however, their portrayals generate perspectives that impact human behavior. The upper class in society is portrayed positively, while the lower class is framed negatively. On the one hand, the upper class contains individuals that should be emulated, comprised of caring and generous people, and those with criminal records have remarkably good lives (Kendall 10). On the other hand, the lower class is framed as homeless, poor, largely ignored by the media, and often discussed as abstract statistics. As such, when casting a human face, the demographics of the poor determine how they are framed. The quality of life may deteriorate from the understanding that as the media focuses on the upper class’s viewpoints and gives voice to their concerns, it neglects the concerns of lower-class members. The conveyed class discourses by the media, including constructions of the homeless and the poor, portrays a lifestyle inflicted by laziness, diseases, crime, and substance abuse (Kendall 94). The dehumanized statistics associated with personalized suffering portray people detached from the broader contributing factors like unemployment, ignorance, laziness, or otherwise responsible people for their misfortunes (Kendall 94). Therefore, courtesy of the detachment, the life quality of the low-class individuals continues to deteriorate since the uneducated and the poor’s needs are overlooked. With attention given to upper-class individuals, the needs of the poor are not voiced; therefore, their lives continue to be exposed to deterioration risks.",
    "Although the Monster can be considered a bad character due to murdering people, the creature has good traits as well. The Monster is described as ugly and strong but at the same time, inexperienced. Firstly, Frankenstein’s creature is described as “its gigantic structure and the deformity of its aspect … instantly informed me that it was the wretch” (Shelley). Despite his ugly and terrifying appearance, the subject did not have the intention to kill people. The creature can be compared to a baby who tries to examine the world it lives in, and its actions are just contractions to the cruelty of the world. Frankenstein’s monster is not a real monster; it just seeks love and attention that the world cannot give him. The creature’s emotionalism is a positive feature as it allows it to understand people’s feelings and share them. The “Gothic” elements of the novel include supernatural motives, the architecture from the Middle Ages, and the spiritual aspects of human nature. Other “Gothic” elements consist of the strive for knowledge, the Monster, and the probable moral fall of men. I like that genre because I like looking at diverse issues from various perspectives. This novel allows me to look at the actions of Victor Frankenstein and the Monster and understand their motives and feelings. I also appreciate novels that aim to show moral aspects of society with the utilization of different symbols, such as the Monster. Mary Shelley’s husband believed that inappropriate social relationships are the result of people becoming evil. To make people bad, other representatives of society should reject them and make them feel useless or bad. I agree with this opinion, as people’s intentions are generally based on their experience of social interactions. If society treats people as if they were misconducts, there is no reason to try to be good or fit in. I believe that one of the integral themes of the novel is loneliness. The Monster aimed to integrate into society; however, people met him with disgust, fear, hatred, and all the spectrum of negative emotions. Hence, the creature turned to evil because of the feeling of loneliness. Nowadays, society often tries to isolate individuals who do not view the world the same as most people do. This feature often leads to the feeling of being lost and lonely.",
    "The concept of “gender roles” is often applied to the analysis and comprehension of writings from various historical periods. These responsibilities appear to have been firmly defined during the Anglo-Saxon period. The poem Beowulf belongs to the epic or heroic poetry genre, which has poems that commemorate the characters’ brave and martial actions. Women are portrayed as belongings for the advantage of the men throughout Beowulf and are made to support the male characters. In addition, women are utilized as plot devices to advance the story tale of men. Women, on the other hand, are a minor character in the plot, their presence being overshadowed by the men. The queen of the Swedes was given no name, her identity being secondary to her status as the king’s wife, Onela. The males, such as Hrothgar, Beowulf, Wiglaf, and Unferth, occupied the majority of the storyline of the poem. As a result, mentions of women are few and far between in comparison. “…the Helming woman went on her rounds…treating the family and the collected troop,” the poem says of a woman who fulfills traditional gender responsibilities as a character Beowulf (Heaney 620). The passage represents the expectation of women in the eleventh century, that they should look after males and be gentle. Queen Modthryth was presented later in the tale as the antithesis to Queen Hygd, who was autonomous and despised by men. “Even a queen of great beauty must not overstep like that,” they said dismissively. (Beowulf 1940-1941), until she married Offa, who rewarded her for her self-control. Queen Modthryth was only considered acceptable by society once she married, implying that women had less value unless they were married.",
    "Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) have become a part of all humans’ lives, but they remain a debatable issue thus far. Some people argue that it is not ethical to change any genetic information and play God (MacKinnon & Fiala, 2017). However, I believe that GMOs are only another advancement in people’s lives as the creation of machines, cars, or spaceships. GMOs (be it a plant or animal) are a part of my life as well, as I have consumed GMO-based products. I am not concerned about long-term effects as much as some of my peers since I find GMOs to be a product of selection that has been in place for centuries. People have noticed some properties they considered to be appropriate for them and tried to grow as many plants and animals that have certain qualities as possible. I would use the principles of utilitarianism to support my claim. This theory is based on the view that everything is ethical if it contributes to as much good for as many people as possible. GMOs can help people overcome one of the major problems that is famine. GMOs are resistant to harsh environmental conditions, so people may grow more crops and other important plants. Millions of people still starve and are in need of food, so the production of more food is beneficial for all. Of course, some use the deontological approach and state that it is simply wrong to interfere with genetic codes as it is the divine domain. GMOs are seen as people’s attempts to play God, which is morally wrong. However, I would stress that even according to the Bible, humans were given the planet to take care of it, so using innovative tools is another way to follow the Christian postulates and take care of all creatures.",
    "The issue of the internationalization of companies is a phenomenon that has consistently attracted the attention of researchers in the field of management. In the last decade, the focus has shifted from considering the benefits and risks of internationalization to studying the strategies of international companies operating and developing. However, it should be remembered that globalization acts as a kind of institutional environment for global companies, characterized by high uncertainty and risks and a non-monotonous, dynamic nature. The main incentive for the globalization and internationalization of the company is a significant expansion of market opportunities, both production, and trade. This is also connected with the benefits gained from implementing an international strategy, namely the growth of the company’s market, economies of scale and learning, and, of course, the advantages of new locations. Many companies from developing countries such as China, India, and Taiwan are active in global value chains in high-tech sectors of the economy (Stallkamp & Schotter, 2019). However, this fact leads to the fact that there is the broadest range of problems inherent in international companies in these countries. For example, emerging markets often have inadequate government oversight and regulation levels, leading to global companies’ unethical and criminal trading practices. For example, a typical example of this is the exploitation of cheap local labor to make production more affordable for international businesses (Mashan, 2021). This is morally and ethically appalling in the extreme but will have dire consequences for the company in the future. Given the benefits of international diversification, some firms choose not to expand internationally for several reasons. The most common of these is the reluctance to go beyond the domestic market of their homeland (Paul & Mas, 2019). This suggests either an unwillingness to face the risks of globalization or an initial calculation of opportunities, taking into account only the company’s home market factors. Moreover, an important reason for the rejection of globalization may be the awareness of problems faced with a foreign market, its characteristics, and potential consumers’ culture, religion, and customs. Thus, the global strategy has its colossal advantages and disadvantages that can push the company away from this approach.",
    "Gnomial Functions Inc. wants to determine the most reliable forecasting technique for determining the sales level for the next eighteen months. The sales trend reflected a consistent increase over the last 18 months with minimal seasonal variation. However, the sales for recent months reflected had more significance on the following months sales (Wisniewski, 2016). Consequently, Gnomial Functions Inc. should use the weighted moving average to forecast the most likely level of sales. The weighted moving average used four weights to determine the likely level of sales in the next month. These weights ranged from 0.1 to 0.4 for the earliest and most recent months respectively. The most recent data received a higher weight due to its higher relevance to the future level of sales. Consequently, the weighted moving average generates accurate forecast compared to the simple moving averages. The company can realize even more accurate forecast by adjusting the weights for the moving average. The management should give higher weight to the recent monthly sales to reduce the forecasting error. Specifically, the mean absolute deviation and mean standard error for the initial weights (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4) was 6.27 and 47.29. In contrast, when the new weights that give more importance to the recent performance (0, 0, 0.4, and 0.6) are applied, the mean absolute deviation declined to 4.81, and the mean standard error declines to 27.28. This performance is better than the simple moving average. Gnomial Functions Inc. should use the weighted moving average to determine the likely level of sales in the next year. This method is simple, effective, and reliable. In addition, it can be adjusted to reflect the changes in sales trend by adjusting the weights to give the requisite importance to the recent months. Therefore, the company should use weighted moving average to estimate the likely performance in the coming year.",
    "The modern world economy is so diverse and deep that it is very difficult to predict for sure when a crisis will break. Recession is danger, and danger is stress – in such a situation, the brain begins to rely on basic instincts of protection – to run, hide, survive. Crisis intervention is a relatively new discipline, the main task of which is to provide temporary emergency emotional assistance to victims of mental and physical violence (Colford & Cavaiola, 2017). Nowadays, there is a risk of economic decline which can seriously affect the entire population; hence, I would not like to experience recession since it would significantly affect my life. The crisis is a phenomenon that takes a toll primarily on the individuals who work for non-profit organizations. There is an increase in layoffs, which means many people will have live on the state allowance. The inability to find a job is the next cause of the crisis. What is more, the level of poverty will raise making people abandon their homes. Individuals will not be able to afford necessary items as well as paying rent. Hence, I consider a recession as an undesirable event for myself due to its damaging nature. When considering the crisis from a professional point of view, the crisis affects the national economy as a whole, affecting not individual enterprises, but the entire sector of the economy. There is an increase in the cost of credit resources and the difficulty of attracting them. In addition, there is a threat of deterioration of relations with international partner organizations. In general, the crisis is an undesirable phenomenon due to its devastating effects and unpredictable consequences.",
    "The YouTube video published by GP Synergy, “GP Training in Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services,” sends a message that Aboriginal Medical Services play a crucial role within the diverse community. The services are essential for providing culturally sensitive and high-quality care to the target populations, often marginalized and underserved, ensuring they have everything they need to tackle rising health concerns. The comprehensive set of services provided by the medical facilities ensures that the patients from the Aboriginal community have access to affordable and convenient health care. One service can support multiple aspects of clients’ lives. The comprehensive approach toward culturally-sensitive care is especially relevant in addressing the social determinants of health (SHOD), which encompass multiple areas of the population’s health, well-being, and quality of life. SDOH includes safe housing, neighborhoods, convenient transportation, racial discrimination and violence, education, income, job opportunities, access to nutritional foods, low-quality air and water, and language and literacy skills (Healthy People 2030, 2020). Therefore, the Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services aims to address the health disparities and inequities that most Aboriginal patients encounter (Pearson et al., 2020). The professionals working within the Aboriginal Community Health Services framework underline the importance of patient education to ensure that the population is aware of its potential health challenges and knows about the necessity of early prevention and management. The prominent SHOD that is being discussed in the “GP Training in Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services” video is discrimination. The health center workers acknowledge that many of their patients have experienced discrimination in the healthcare system and want to receive culturally-sensitive services (Kim, 2019). Providing such services is challenging because healthcare workers do not know what to expect from each patient and must be prepared to carry out culturally sensitive services (Jongen, McCalman, and Bainbridge, 2018). Care continuity is especially relevant in this case because when patients feel that they are being discriminated against or misunderstood, they are less likely to return to their providers to continue treatment or screening for their core health concerns. Even though implementing culturally sensitive care and addressing the SHOD of discrimination is challenging for providers, it is also highly rewarding. The patients discriminated against want to feel accepted, understood, and cared for. Because of this, the workers of the Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services institutions always prioritize building meaningful relationships with their patients (Luft, 2017). Besides, the professionals have noted that they have taken the role of advocates who support their patients in terms of healthcare services and their acceptance in their immediate community and the larger society. Therefore, the work of Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services professionals entails consistent collaboration between themselves and their patients who feel underserved and misunderstood. To conclude, addressing the social determinants of health that affects the Aboriginal community is a demanding process that requires dedication and focuses on the unique needs of patients coming to a facility to receive culturally-sensitive care. Undoubtedly, the process will take some time because healthcare providers must be well-prepared and well-versed in the social determinants of health affecting their clients.",
    "The cultural effects of Roman dominance over the Greek-speaking regions is a fascinating topic that has attracted great scientific interest, especially in the last couple of years. The impact of the interaction between two cultures varied in time and space and was definitely more prominent in places where Roman communities had emerged. These communities served as the so-called influence vectors, and their long residing alongside Greeks resulted in the transmission of Roman elements into public life. One of such elements was Roman names, the dissemination of which may be explained by the existence of networks of exchange and the sense of identity of name bearers. Rizakis (2019) notes that the introduction of the Greeks to the Roman system of naming with its further adaptation to their norms and the Roman names adoption by peregrine Greeks are two different phenomena. However, they both are examples of the interaction process between the two traditions, which gradually led to the appearance of a common onomastic culture. This acculturation form, increased in the 2 nd century AD, showed wide regional variability, and the reception of it was different in different cities and social classes. These cultural transfers were mostly mediated by civic elites, as their purpose was to pass on their influence by name – both in a regional context and more broadly, on a system level. Tria nomina, in particular, and its use in the imperial period especially, as stated by Rizakis (2019), was a source of pride, power, and prestige. Due to this, some names became popular as expressions of the shared culture and were accepted and adopted, albeit on a small scale, by the lower classes as well, having lost their original meaning. However, the dominance of Roman names as the distinguishing signs of the Empire’s free citizens took place for a short amount of time. As per Rizakis (2019), by the end of the 3 rd century AD, a new way of identity expression appeared – a single naming system using separate Greek and Roman names. At first it was used sparingly but after the reign of Constantine – and especially during the period of late antiquity – it started being employed in almost all Roman provinces. This change, advanced by Christianity’s progress and the Roman Empire’s decline, might be deemed as a return to the Greek naming tradition.",
    "Health promoters are a trained workforce whose primary purpose is to improve health through a variety of activities carried out by health promotion organizations. Individual empowerment, societal responsibility for health, and establishing an enabling environment for developing personal skills and boosting community action are among their top goals (Nutbeam, 2019). In the realm of health promotion, experts from various multidisciplinary health workers have agreed on the characteristics of effective collaboration and an interdisciplinary approach. Interdisciplinary teams’ most essential purpose is to bring together a variety of diverse viewpoints on caring and to use the talents and knowledge of many different individuals and sectors. Intersectional collaboration between different health professionals and the public and commercial sectors is critical for effective health promotion (US Department of Health and Human Services, 2018). The diversity of these elements demonstrates that one’s health is not just dependent on medical services or nurses and physicians (Nutbeam, 2019). The large range of activities that make up health promotion needs a diverse set of abilities from a number of health professionals and industries. Incorporating multidisciplinary specialists within the health promotion team, such as Nurse Practitioners (NPs), Social Workers (SWs), and Registered Nurses (RNs), will be advantageous in the long and short term. Nurse practitioners are nurses who receive further education and training and are capable of treating a wide range of ailments as well as providing preventative care and health education (Pun, 2018). Social workers have specialized training in assisting people and groups in developing skills and resolving difficulties. Whether the issues are personal, interpersonal, or social in nature, social workers can assist in guiding and resolving many of today’s issues (Nutbeam, 2019). Registered nurses examine and analyze healthcare needs in order to decide the best service or treatment, the best healthcare provider, and the best equipment to deliver patient care (Pun, 2018). Thus, their skills and approach will be essential in the success of an interdisciplinary team tasked with health promotion.",
    "Like many other areas of life, music has changed along with society. The period between 1959 and 1963 was transitional, and at least two distinct markets emerged in the music industry (Covach and Flory 112). The first one was defined by the new generation of teenagers who favored dance music (Covach and Flory 113). The second market consisted of former rock and rollers who preferred folk music associated with social, political, and economic issues (Covach and Flory 113). Folk had a long history of addressing problems within American society, and its music appeared to be more dedicated to the community than commercial pop (Covach and Flory 118-119). Folk performers appealed to the audience and represented people rather than being above them (Covach and Flory 119). Almost anyone could play folk, as the music was simple and required a few easy guitar accords (Covach and Flory 119). Thus, the idea spread of folk being “for the people and by the people” (Covach and Flory 119-120). The concept was related to the music and the people’s ideologies, as the singers and the audience, united by social issues, expressed their concerns through songs. As folk was the music of people, it was also a movement characterized by many important figures. The Weavers consisted of traditional performers such as Peete Seeger and were one of the most significant folk groups in the US (Covach and Flory 119). The Weavers focused on societal problems and prioritized the simplicity of the music, gaining an audience among college students (Covach and Flory 119). At the beginning of the 1960s, The Kingston Trio was the most popular group that started the folk revival in the mainstream pop market (Covach and Flory 119-120). The Kingston Trio’s pop-sensitive approach was favored by the public and defined folk music for many general listeners (Covach and Flory 120-121). Considerable singers have represented folk music, supporting the movement of addressing issues within society.",
    "The Roman Empire was largely polytheistic, suggesting that people acknowledged and honored several different gods. They thought that these entities had a part in the formation of Roman civilization and shaped the events of people’s everyday lives (Bartsch, 2020). Because of Rome’s geographical location, its population had regular interaction with Greek peoples who had expanded their territory into the Italian peninsula and Sicily (Beard, 2015). Many features of Greek culture were borrowed by Rome, with minor modifications to fit their requirements. According to Polybius ‘ interpretation of the Roman government, the monarchy was solidified in the office of the Consul. The tales of Manilus Hippomanes, Olivier de Noyen, and Julien Barneuve are connected through history in The Dream of Scipio by a philosophical musing claiming that man is accountable for his action’s own redemption, but only by understanding, not by works or faith (Ruden, 2013). Rome had two chancellors, each in control of divisions of the Roman army and had the authority to convene conferences and present different initiatives before the Senate; they were acclaimed yearly. Citizenship in Rome was a complicated notion that differed depending on one’s gender, family, and status in society. Males were the only ones who could acquire full citizenship. A kid born of a legal union between a citizen father and a citizen mother would be granted citizenship by descent (Beard, 2015). Citizenship in the United States can be obtained by birth or registration. People are generally born U.S. citizens if they are born in America or are born overseas to U.S. citizens. They may also obtain U.S. nationality as a youngster as a result of the marriage of one or both adults.",
    "A proposed financial plan to support Mental Health Services for Healthcare Providers of Critical Patients: Category Subcategory Expenditures ($) Staff Mental Health Service Manager 400,000 Personal Consultants 840,000 Group Consultants 650,000 Technical Support Staff 180,000 Equipment Personal Laptops 12,000 Personal Mobile Phones 5,000 Services Telephone Service 2,400 Internet Service 300 Supplies Administrative Supplies 500 Medication 1,500 Training Employee Training 2,000 Managerial Training 2,000 Maintenance Offices Maintenance 3,000 Laptops and Mobile Phones Maintenance 1,500 Other Expenditures Unforeseen Expenditures 5,000 The impact of a biblical stewardship perspective on the proposed financial plan The biblical perspective on stewardship presumes that leaders are granted control over other people and resources by God (Carradus, Zozimo, & Discua Cruz, 2020). Thus, they should strive to ensure the well-being of every person in order to honor the Lord. In this regard, the current financial plan was designed in a manner that would benefit all the stakeholders involved, including healthcare providers of critical patients and consulting staff. The potential holes and unknowns in the project’s financial plan Although the financial plan seemingly addresses most of the expenses that may occur during the project realization, there are still some unknowns that should be considered. As such, O’Connell (2020) argues that managers should always think about the worst-case scenario and be prepared to respond adequately. In the case of the current project, first of all, it is hard to predict the real demand for mental health services among doctors. This, in turn, negatively affects the ability to predict the required number of mental health workers. Secondly, potential crises and resulting inflation rates may cause a price increase, which, in turn, would necessitate additional money to purchase equipment and medication. Moreover, the costs for the services, training, and maintenance may also surge. Assumptions that can fill the potential holes in the project’s financial plan As for the former hole in the financial plan, it can be assumed that there will be an average demand for mental services among healthcare professionals. This assumption would help to partly mitigate the risks of the unknown need for offered services. It is explained by the fact that when the expected demand is low but the actual necessity is high, then the patients are largely underserved. On the contrary, when expectations are high, but the actual demand is low, it leads to substantial financial losses. As for inflation, it is necessary to assume a certain amount of money for unforeseen expenditures. Therefore, if the prices rise, the organization will still be able to pay for the planned expenses.",
    "In the article “The influence of peers during adolescence: Does homophobic name-calling by peers change gender identity?” the authors claim that negative name-calling among peers can lead to a change in gender identity. Firstly, this is because negative experiences with peers of the same sex result in the need to identify with peers of the opposite sex. Secondly, during the period of growing up, the adolescents’ identity is not yet fully established. Therefore, they are constantly re-evaluating whether the identity formation is going in the right direction. DeLay et al. (2018) recognize that homophobia can be directed at homosexual and heterosexual adolescents. This is presumably because the purpose of victimization is to hurt someone’s feelings, not point out real flaws. Gender identity development is a critical stage in developing a personality occurring during adolescence (DeLay et al., 2018). Since homophobic name-calling is a form of victimization, this practice should be frowned upon or banned in schools. Ioverno et al. (2021) note that “bullying GNCV may represent a defensive reaction to demonstrate bullies’ gender conformity” (p. 215). Therefore, work with bullies should be carried out competently and with the participation of a psychologist. Interestingly, Ioverno et al. (2021) highlight how this statement is especially true for male bullies. That is because their “own gender conformity can affect the selection of victims based on their gender conformity” (p. 216). It is critical to understand this mirror interaction to resolve the issues of gender victimization. Equally important, victimization of adolescents, including LGB, trans, and heterosexual high school students may lead to “anxiety, depression, and substance use disorders, especially among sexual and gender minority youth” (Valido et al., p. 602). This is another valuable observation that indicates the need for concomitant prevention practices of substance abuse among adolescents. No less important, substance abuse should be perceived as the consequence of psychological problems.",
    "The first mention of a homosexual act is found in the Old Testament Book of Leviticus. And it is said there about this in a prohibitive manner: “Do not lie down with a man as with a woman: this is an abomination.” (Leviticus 18:22) The Apostle Paul says the following: “Just as men, having rejected natural intercourse with women, burn with lust for one another: men do shameful deeds with men, preparing for themselves the retribution that they deserve, having gone astray.” (Rom 1:27) First of all, when talking about homosexuality – the scriptures talk about “intercourse” or “lust,” but not about orientation in the sense that homosexual people today have in mind – an equal love relationship between two partners of the same sex. Homosexual relationships have been shared at all times and in all societies. However, the idea of ​​”orientation” as a property inherent in a particular person is relatively new; it appears only towards the end of the 19th century, making it difficult to directly compare the phenomenon of homosexuality in the context of Christianity (Kuefler 1256). The second important point is comparing religious books of homosexual relationships with a relationship with women. Homosexuality existed in the ancient world and the Middle Ages – but it was never understood as an equal union. In the Christian world, the execution was supposed to be for sodomites. In England, sodomites were executed until the New Times; for a long time, homosexuals were one of the targets of the Inquisition. The Code of Justinian in Byzantium provided severe punishments for them: up to castration and the death penalty. Given the high religiosity in the authorities, such persecution was supported by religious overtones. However, there was no equal modern understanding of the union, even at the level of a philosophical idea: such events were a deviation from the norm and were not perceived fundamentally.",
    "The framers of the Constitution did not believe that citizens would take an active part in the political life of the country. While many freedoms were incorporated in the Constitution, its framers doubted whether people were interested enough in politics to follow its makings. It is true that in those times, information was limited; however, nowadays, mass media help people to be well-informed about political events. Moreover, the media act as a watchdog on the governmental powers (How Does the Media Affect Politics). Informational agencies report the events and let readers make their minds about them or share their views (How Does the Media Affect Politics). However, it always pays not to rely on the media too much and take pains to follow the political life of the country. They felt that everyday citizens were uninformed and did not care what was going on in our government. I disagree that citizens are uninformed and do not care about political life. Nowadays, there are many organizations that promote civil rights and freedoms closely following the events on the political landscape of the country. People do not wait for a crisis to voice their opinions; on the contrary, citizens try to stay well-informed about what is going on (Jach & Trolian, 2022). The media, as a great source of information, facilitates this task, allowing people to have access to the latest events all over the world (Greenberg & Page, 2015). Crises as such make people more interested in politics, but there are many people who take pains to voice their opinions, notwithstanding the political or economic situation. These people deserve great respect as they act as watchdogs on the wide judicial, legislative, and executive powers vested in our politicians and judges by the laws we have adopted as a nation.",
    "Olivier Armantier’s et al. article, “How Economic Crises Affect Inflation Beliefs: Evidence from the COVID-19 Pandemic,” was published in the Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization on July 24, 2021. Publisher Elsevier has partnered with the Copyright Center RightsLink service to offer various options for reusing this content. Elsevier offers open or restricted access to content with permanently unique identifiers to include links and citations. This paper is an independent article focusing on the state of the public economy during COVID-19. In their paper, the authors examine changes in the perception of inflation during the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although this paper is an independent work, Armantier et al. (2021) complemented other research in the field analyzing economic changes during the COVID-19 recession. A feature of the article is the study by the authors of the consequences of inflationary crises and comparison with pre-existing crises to calculate the level of the crisis as a whole. The survey’s main purpose is to collect against a wide range of economic outcomes. As a result of their research, the authors studied the evolution of households’ perceptions of inflation and concluded that the growth of inflationary expectations was more restrained. It means that the muted reaction of average inflation expectations masks a significant polarization of views, especially in the short term (Bekaert et al., 2020). A significant proportion of households, particularly those with higher education, initially expected that the pandemic would lead to low inflation or even deflation (Armantier et al., 2021). Thus, the authors achieved their goal and confirmed their results with numerous graphs and tables presented in the article. I liked the study by Armantier et al. (2021) because the authors look at non-traditionally triggered crises and household responses. In addition, through comparative analysis with past crises, Armantier et al. (2021) determine the spread of the crisis due to erroneous assumptions about inflation to other areas of the economy (Armantier et al., 2021). For example, the Great Recession was predominantly a strong negative demand shock driven by a falling house and stock prices. I also liked that the authors found evidence for strong polarization of inflation perceptions and identified differences between demographic groups.",
    "With the widespread use of digital technology, email has gained particular importance. With email, communication has become much easier, as people have been able to communicate with colleagues, relatives, loved ones, and business partners and representatives of organizations, literally in real-time, avoiding all the difficulties of “physical” communication. However, what is interesting is a study of the extent to which such communication has been modified with the advent of the phenomenon of email. In the context of interpersonal communication, two effects should be highlighted. First, email has meaningfully broadened the scope of communication so that communication is no longer only realized in the real world but can easily be continued online as well. This has changed the perception of interpersonal communication and greatly simplified the availability of communication. Meanwhile, email has changed the perception of nonverbal communication through emotions and body language, since in text correspondence, especially of a business nature, such expressions of speech do not make sense (Smith, n.d.). Of course, there are alternatives in the form of emoji and stickers, but in emails, as a rule, such forms are rarely used, unlike in messengers. From these features, an essential advantage of email is highlighted, namely increased accessibility, the possibility of virtually limitless communication, and staying connected with people at all times. However, there are also disadvantages: dependence on Internet equipment, the need for an electronic device, and any cybersecurity concerns. It is easy to make mistakes in electronic correspondence, as individuals automatically try to extrapolate real-world communication skills to the digital world. These mistakes include ignoring the type of interlocutor and lack of digital etiquette, mixing up writing styles, and sending long, unstructured messages (CNBC, 2018). To avoid making these mistakes in everyday correspondence, it is advisable to learn the rules of electronic etiquette, review your messages before sending, the appropriateness of using slang and style for specific interlocutors and reducing the letter to the minimum size that retains meaning.",
    "Despite numerous calls to concentrate on customer satisfaction or improve work engagement, countless American corporate executives remain obsessed with their companies’ financial growth. Even so, making a profit is the only way the world can tell if a company is doing things correctly. Furthermore, if a company ceases to make money, it may cease operations entirely. Clearly, some businesses lack the financial resources to fully capitalize on available product market growth opportunities. Others do not have opportunities that are commensurate with their financial means. Sources of finance and product-market opportunities influence how quickly a company can grow. To understand how fast a company should grow, a manager must first investigate the relationship between “inflation, capital costs, profitability, growth, and the market value of a company’s common stock” (Fruhan, 2014, para. 4). The profitability of a company depends on two factors: the expected return on equity (ROE) and the cost of capital. If ROE is predicted to surpass the cost of equity capital, more growth will only have a positive impact on the business’s operations and health. On the other hand, if ROE is not expected to exceed the cost of capital, then the company should consider a strategy of rapid negative growth. Insufficient earnings combined with the necessity to do little more than finance inflation-induced revenue growth can be devastating for the firm’s value (Fruhan, 2014). Businesses in this situation should contemplate a rapid slowing growth program if they are unable to increase revenue. However, in order to maintain properly set growth, a company must meet inflation expectations and even surpass the inflation rate. For example, if an inflation rate is 10%, the company must not only maintain its earnings to beat the inflation rate but try to achieve higher results. According to the statistics provided by Dow Jones, between 1965 and 1981, the inflation rate increased dramatically each year (Fruhan, 2014). Therefore, while Treasury bonds yield about 11%, overall long-term inflation expectations equal 10% (Fruhan, 2014). This means that companies must grow fast enough to keep the cost of equity capital for common stock at 19–20%. Hence, a business should grow according to the inflation rate and other indicators. This way, in order to remain lucrative to investors, an organization needs to beware of a long-term inflation rate. While Treasury bonds are predicted to yield 10% annually, companies need to provide a premium of 9–10%, which in the end equals 19–20% growth. If a company cannot meet the expectations of investors and surpass the inflation rate, it is doomed. Moreover, a company needs to check its ROE and the cost of equity capital. When the former surpasses the latter, a company will be able to create ample growth. When a business fails to oversee these two points and grows more rapidly than it can manage, it can do more harm to its financial health.",
    "The chapter in question tells the story of how global trade has enriched and changed cultures. During the analyzed period, many wealthy rulers and merchants began to demonstrate their power by acquiring exotic works of art. Ideas and books circulated, and cultural exchange was extremely active. People became more tolerant of diversity and more aware of how diverse the world around them was. Ties between different cultures were strengthened because of the continuing strong globalization. European influence had spread so far that the norms and habits of people from the West were beginning to be considered universal and objective (Adelman et al., 2021, p. 597). The key term of the era becomes the Enlightenment, marking a period of triumph of human reason. People begin to think that they can understand the laws of nature and human behavior. The importance of the chapter lies in its multifaceted analysis of the period, taking into account the contribution of each continent. Among the major events, the book describes is how the three great powers formed a group in West and South Asia. The author describes how the rulers of the Ottoman, Safavid, and Mughal dynasties contributed to the cultural development of their countries. The development of China, Japan, the two Americas, the slave states of Africa, and the development of Australia are also narrated. Particular emphasis is placed on how the interaction and mutual influence of different cultures contributed to their overall development. The sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries saw a global cultural renaissance brought on by the growth of new wealth (Adelman et al., 2021, p. 595). There was an increase in the consumption of books, and a greater number of previously unseen monuments were formed (Adelman et al., 2021, p. 595). The world has become highly integrated due to the spread of international trade. However, not all countries were willing to change and only agreed to adapt to the new norms. The Islamic and Chinese worlds generally maintained their identities, but America and Oceania could not resist European cultural pressure.",
    "Summary Today opioids are the most commonly used drug in the United States. For a long time, opiates have been used as effective pain relievers, but their relaxing effects started making people abuse them recreationally. Opioids cause a strong feeling of euphoria, which leads to the risk of using recreational substances. Addicted people have a constant desire to increase the dose, which is a severe medical and social problem. The United States is facing one of the worst drug crises in history. More than half of deaths are associated with prescription opioids: heroin and fentanyl (Coon et al., 2022). The number has risen nationwide amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The crisis has acquired enormous proportions and become a brake on the economy and a threat to national security. Forms of Treatment Available to those Suffering from Opioid Addiction The most effective way to overcome opioid addiction is recognized as “substitution therapy”. This approach involves using a drug with less addictive potential as a legal alternative to heroin and other highly addictive drugs. Three substances are currently approved for substitution therapy: methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone (Volkow et al., 2014). Medications are determined with cautiousness to avoid unwanted psychoactive effects. For example, a significant disadvantage of methadone is its ability to provoke a strong withdrawal syndrome in case of discontinuation of its use. To alleviate the patient’s condition, doctors can resort to additional help with tranquilizers, antidepressants, antipsychotics, and non-opioid analgesics. In addition, doctors widely use symptomatic treatment and supportive therapy (Volkow et al., 2014). In the severe phase of withdrawal, the patient should be under constant medical supervision. Helping a Friend or a Family Member with an Opioid Addiction The most important aspect of the treatment motivation is the family. It is necessary to help a person acquire a sincere desire to battle for life. Rehab centers remain an effective chance for an addicted person to return to a healthy, drug-free life. It uses a unique rehabilitation program that allows one not only to overcome addiction but to return to a healthy lifestyle and realize its value (Brown, 2018). To provide effective motivation, the psychiatrist should learn all the necessary data about the addicted person. It will require the assistance of relatives and friends who can tell about the psychological atmosphere, patients’ habits, interests, and family relationships.",
    "Social responsibility entails policies that organizations put in place as part of a company’s governance projected to ensure the corporate’s functions are effective and beneficial to all stakeholders. These guidelines help protect the environment, improve the quality of life for societies, and provide a conducive working environment through recognizing and appreciating talented and hardworking employees. This increases customer loyalty as clients feel they are helping the business support worthy initiatives, thus, enabling more access to funds and allowing more investors to join and support the company. The business rewards employees through meaningful praises, which makes them appreciated. It provides workers a chance to lead by example while giving them the capacity to make decisions without interference, demonstrating that they are trusted and capable (Yang et al., 2019). Additional monetary motivations comprise yearly or semi-yearly bonuses. Additionally, paid time-off and cash prizes help to boost performance while encouraging feelings. The company exercises CSR by adopting a business code of ethics, which shapes workers’ behavior on morals, standards, environment, self-esteem, and customer service. The organization has established dependable systems to protect staff and avoid accidents and injuries (Tamvada, 2020). It also ensures suppliers are aware of and meet the expectations of responsible conduct concerning issues such as affordable costs. For instance, screening dealers to define their past behavior and discuss what the company expects. The only change in CSR that I would suggest is how the organization handles employees’ creativity. I would encourage the company to set a stage for brainstorming, thus, encouraging new ideas and creativity (Tamvada, 2020). Regarding complaints about the company engagement and expenditures, it is evident that the business is striving to improve CSR, and the further it advances in that direction, the more it benefits. For instance, experiencing more brand recognition means increases in sales. Nestle has endeavored to become a socially responsible and environmentally sustainable corporation. Thus, it qualifies for a pass because of its tremendous achievement in empowering communities. It has improved people’s living standards, creating access to hygiene and clean water and motivating populations to live healthy lifestyles. I would recommend the company implement an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process (Tamvada, 2020). ERM should be applied since it is designed to find possible events that can affect the business. This will also help manage risks and opportunities and develop meaningful assurance concerning company objectives.",
    "The secret of IKEA’s success on the global market lies in its perfect execution of all components of the marketing mix. The company has adapted its strategy to each market with precision, flexibility, and creativity that made its products highly recognized. The ingenuity of its marketing mix proposal can serve as an example for other companies in Europe and worldwide. In this paper, the four components of IKEA’s marketing mix will be discussed. This Swedish company has gained renown for the quality, accessibility, and innovativeness of its products. First of all, the firm’s pricing strategy is focused on affordability, as the structure and logistics of its stores are optimized for a maximum price reduction (O’Neill, 2021). Promotions of this store chain are widespread through all communication channels, ranging from local radio stations to social media accounts made for each region individually. IKEA stays on top of modern advertising strategies and employs influencers to reach younger audiences (O’Neill, 2021). Regarding its locations, IKEA continuously selects places where it will remain accessible for the public while keeping its prices at the lowest. However, the most notable feature of this company is its products. Its home furniture is easy to recognize for its style, modularity, and reusability (O’Neill, 2021). There is a constant stream of new products in IKEA, giving customers a reason to keep visiting it on a regular basis. In conclusion, IKEA’s marketing mix shows how affordable, stylish, and recognizable products are able to capture customers’ hearts and solidify a company’s success for decades to come. There is a piece of furniture for every need and every customer’s taste, as their modularity enables creativity beyond compare. IKEA’s drive to provide its customers with products they desire gave it an immense competitive advantage in Europe and worldwide.",
    "Neil Foley talks about the role of Mexican Americans in the history of the U.S. in Mexicans in the Making of America. The author gave his view of these events in the first chapter, “The Genesis of Mexican America,” where he presented the history of the appearance of Mexican Americans and the silent conflict between the two countries. The author’s central claim is that the American government created an image of lazy Mexican immigrants who cross the border to murder and sell illicit drugs; this stigmatization affected Mexican Americans, too (Foley 34). However, the truth was that white settlers from the southern states were illegal invaders in Texas in the 1830s because they refused to obey the country’s laws (Imery-Garcia 12). Discrimination against Mexican immigrants and citizens was rooted in the 1846-1848 war and the treaty’s approval, which included Texas and Mexican people living there into the U.S. territory and being denied their rights. It was interesting to learn from this chapter the viewpoint of many people in the United States about Mexico as a country of cruel and uneducated people. Indeed, it points to the erased memory of the Aztec Empire, the abolition of slavery in Mexico much earlier than in the U.S., and the annexation of Texas. The 1846-1848 war between the two countries was an unfair, violent act of the U.S. government towards a weaker neighbor, which suffered economic downfall at that time (Foley 24). The new legislation after the war gave people the choice of returning to Mexico or becoming U.S. citizens with formally equal rights that were not respected in reality (Gutiérrez 5). Therefore, most of them wanted to be viewed as Spanish Americans rather than people of Mexican descent to avoid stigmatization. I agree with the author’s final point that this historical event created not only a political border between two neighbors but caused subsequent misunderstandings in the relationships between the two nations. In summary, the first chapter in Foley’s Mexicans in the Making of America talks about the origin of Mexican Americans. Specifically, it analyzed the role of the war between Mexico and the U.S. for Texas’s territory in the future political climate between these countries. Overall, the annexation of Texas damaged the relations between them, resulting in the negative perception of Mexican immigrant workers and the desire of Mexican Americans to hide their ancestry.",
    "When many people have a chance to interact simultaneously, especially in learning settings, it may easily lead to the occurrence of conflicts and arguments. The talkative or negative members undoubtedly impact the atmosphere within the team (Jacobs et al., 2016). It seems that “the show-off” might negatively influence the moods of all the members, considering that it is easy to get irritated by such a type of behavior (Jacobs et al., 2016). In addition, show-offs’ aim is to impress people around them, especially a group leader, and to do so, they usually opt for talking without a stop or boasting, which distracts other members. It is a common issue in group settings as such members desire to attract attention to themselves as they might be insecure or not confident in themselves. That is why the show-offs tend to answer all the questions, even those that are not directed at them. Moreover, they can attract a leader’s attention by asking irrelevant or off-topic questions. As a matter of fact, non-stop talking may be an obstacle for reaching a productive learning atmosphere as, eventually, people will be irritated and not have acquired any helpful knowledge during the lesson. The constant involvement of the show-offs in the educational process is likely to annoy other members so that they will develop hatred for such type of behavior (Forsyth, 2019). Furthermore, the show-offs can easily prevent the group from reaching the set aim by distracting them through their foolery and over-involvement in the whole process. Overall, such members can harm the group’s productivity and effectiveness in learning as they opt for attracting all the attention to themselves without giving other individuals opportunities to realize their potentials within the settings.",
    "The airline industry has been hit particularly hard by Covid 19. The virus outbreak has caused the governments of most countries to implement restrictions on traveling (Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Aviation, 2022). Thus, the regulatory implementations have negatively affected the standard revenue, business practices, and practices of airline companies. First, passengers were less keen to travel due to the testing regulations, limited resources, and the lack of need to travel for work. Another cause was the regulation themselves that implied a reduction in Covid-19 cases through quarantine measures. The low demand has caused the airlines to lose revenue ($372 bn), which was an unprecedented change in the industry (Economic impacts of covid-19 on Civil Aviation, 2021). Flights were being canceled, and employees were laid off due to the challenging situation in which the corporations could not sustain airports with such a low passenger rate. The airline companies have experienced major economic challenges that have been facilitated by all the negative implications of the pandemic on civil aviation. As a result, fewer seats were being offered (-50%), and fewer passengers were able to travel via plane (-2,7 bn) (Economic impacts of covid-19 on Civil Aviation, 2021). The effect was slightly balanced out due to the fact that cargo flights have been less impacted or even increased in rates due to the transportation of medical supplies (Nižetić, 2020, p. 10953). However, as vaccines became available and fewer restrictions were put in place, the situation has changed for the better in 2021. More opportunities have occurred due to the less rigid regulatory implementations, vaccination, and other beneficial factors. As exemplified in the relevant literature, the lost revenue in 2021 was slightly lower ($324 Bn). Even though these figures look dismal, the year 2021 has seen a slight improvement, with the years to come sure to be better and better.",
    "The researchers base their conclusion on three well-designed case studies touching on various software applications. The case studies include evaluating bone fractures following traffic accidents, bone injuries caused by a spade, and gunshot wounds on the head, which offer valuable data on enhancing contemporary forensic investigations (Buck et al., 2008). The modeling software and haptic device used for the study boast high precision, low friction, superior fidelity, and output capacity of six degrees of freedom. In the present world, these are top-notch specifications for such discourses. However, replicating the study to verify the findings may prove a challenge due to the high cost of assembling all the specimens and equipment utilized therein (Pinzon et al., 2016). The researchers do well to draw their interpretations and conclusions from the gathered data involving the three separate case studies cited above. The results of the studies indicate that haptic devices can prove very valuable in post-mortem and forensic investigations. In forensic science, the research can be instrumental in enabling investigators to recreate a crime scene (such as gun-holding position) and identify the object used in the crime with enhanced precision and speed. Hagmann et al. (2021) thus note that the use of haptics in forensic science can hasten the criminal justice process and make investigations more reliable. The research is highly innovative as it facilitates the use of technology to recreate crime scenes and enables the user to get the sense of touch often lost during such virtual excursions. Thus, the user can handle and feel 3D digital information, which is significant innovation and improves current technologies. According to Joukal et al. (2015), there may arise controversies surrounding the use of haptics due to fears of corrupting operating systems and online hacking to manipulate investigation findings. Such possibilities may impact the reliability of such devices in criminal justice proceedings. In terms of ethics, the machines make investigations much more expensive to conduct due to costly equipment and training for personnel involved (Fahrni et al., 2019). The costs may hinder the quest for justice in some cases, primarily in low-income areas. Nevertheless, the innovation is evident, and the researchers do well to draw solid conclusions based on their three well-designed case studies.",
    "The origins of slavery in the American territories and why it came to be From 1526 until 1776, complex pressures shaped the structure of slavery in the United States, and historians have proposed multiple ideas to explain how slave trade evolved. Slavery was strongly related to labor demand in European colonies, particularly in the Caribbean and South America’s labor-intensive sugar plantation industries of Great Britain, Spain, France, and the Dutch Republic. Slave ships transported captives from Africa to the West and indigenous peoples were enslaved in North American colonies on a smaller scale (OpenStax, 2019). However, Indian slavery effectively stopped in the late eighteenth century. How slavery was handled differently in each colonial territory of British North America Enslaved people worked in various sectors, including breweries, shipyards, plantations, and timber yards. In the regions north of Maryland, slavery would gradually give way to free labor. The slave population in the North progressively fell throughout the 1760s and 1770s with slaves in Philadelphia reducing to approximately 700 in 1775 (OpenStax, 2019). Antislavery activism was rife in the city, with nationalist pamphleteers handing out antislavery booklets to blacks and whites. The presence of antislavery groups facilitated the spread of manumissions thus slavery became less viable in the North. New York had a high percentage of slaves who acquired valuable trades such as masonry and goldsmithing working alongside artisan masters. All slaves in New York were freed in 1827 (OpenStax, 2019) despite the liberation sentiment in the North during the Revolutionary battle. The contrasts between indentured servants and slaves Indentured service varied from enslavement in that it was a type of debt servitude where an agreed-upon period of unpaid service that often covered the servant’s costs of immigration to America. Indentured workers were not awarded incomes, although they were housed, clothed, and nourished in most cases. Slaves were deemed property and were only awarded freedom on rare occasions despite several years of strenuous labor (Gabor, 2021). Slaves were sold, exchanged, negotiated for, and even utilized as property in a will.",
    "The issue of tribal sovereignty has been scrutinized over the years, the treatment of tribes ranging from supportive measures and attempts of integration into the broader community to outright persecution. In this connection, the law about tribal gaming can be seen as a positive step towards recognition of tribes’ unique way of life and self-determination. This essay discusses the question “how tribal gaming act can add to the sovereignty of tribes?” Under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, tribes were given the right to determine what gaming activities they wanted to engage in, and in most cases, the permission was granted by the state. Gaming activities could embrace tribal rituals or games of chance, depending on the wishes of the tribes and had to be agreed to by the state (Light and Rand). Since often tribal games are unique and have a deep meaning for the tribe, it would be right to say that granting tribes the right to hold their own games is necessary. This measure helps to uphold their culture and establish sovereignty over a very important sphere of life, which is relaxation. Moreover, gaming helps to support traditions and customs through rituals that have been molded over the centuries. As far as sovereignty is concerned, gaming serves to establish the spheres of life which are completely under the tribes’ jurisdiction. Thus, for example, some tribe members mix with the society at large, finding employment or integrating themselves in the life of big cities. However, gaming, and in particular traditional tribal gaming, serves as a reminder of one’s roots, promotes freedom of choice and sovereignty as it is the one thing that is almost completely under the tribes’ jurisdiction.",
    "Individual freedoms and national security are sometimes seen as two opposites. However, in ideal, national security should reflect the balanced relationship between the two mentioned concepts. Moreover, the principle of the prevalence of individual freedoms over the national security underlies the democratic idea. Individual freedoms include individual rights and are protected by the US Constitution (Longley). This paper argues that individual freedoms should never be sacrificed in the name of national security. This essay proposes that the protection of individual freedoms by maintaining national security is a fundamental principle and goal of democracy. US President Joe Biden notes, “I strongly believe that democracy is the key to freedom, prosperity, peace, and dignity” (Biden 3). Unlike authoritarian or totalitarian systems, a democratic system puts individual freedoms ahead of national security interests. The implementation of this principle always raises controversy, since there is no single rule universal for all cases. However, individual freedoms are protected in most areas of social life, including migration, cyber security, economic stability, and international diplomatic relations. Interestingly, actual cyber security policy and practice take both human-centric and national-security-centric approaches (Deibert 411). In this regard, the states develop “indivisible network security on a planetary scale for the widest possible coverage of the human experience” (Deibert 412). The above example indicates the breadth of possibilities for applying the principle. There is probably a counter-argument against the opinion that national security interests should take precedence over individual freedoms. This position can be justified by an external threat or military ambitions and is usually applied by authoritarian regimes. This position is wrong since national security should protect the interest of every citizen, not the abstract idea of the nation. Every citizen is part of the nation and their freedoms should be sacred. Thus, it was discussed, how individual freedoms should never be sacrificed in the name of national security. The necessity to sacrifice individual freedoms is usually promoted by authoritarian regimes whose real purpose is to meet the interests of the regime. On the contrary, in democratic states, individual freedoms are fundamental and cannot be violated under any circumstances. These freedoms are sacred and ensure the integrity of the democratic states.",
    "Elements Diamonds by Rihanna was first heard on Elvis Duran Show on September 26, 2012, availed for online download an hour after being released to the public, and was released as the album’s lead single the following day. Sia wrote the song for Rihanna, who holds the song’s copyrights and worked on it a year prior; therefore, the song is owned by an independent contractor (Anggraini 12). Unapologetic is Barbadian artist Rihanna’s seventh studio album, and the song “Diamonds” appears on it (Anggraini 7). Using Sia’s demo vocals as a guide, Rihanna imitated her inflections to the precise tiniest detail. It was only after Benny Blanco heard the finished track to the Australian songwriter did, she realize the vocals belonged to her alone. Inspiration In Diamonds , Rihanna contemplated the existence of both love and diamonds: “Yellow diamonds in the light. To make things even more awkward, we’re standing next to each other. You cross my path as your shadow does.” The diamonds in the song symbolize a silver lining that illustrates the chance for a better future and happier days among dark and depressing days. The song made me think about all the possibilities available when things do not turn out to be as I expected. I also chose the song because its presentation, which was both positive and hopeful, and I am always in a good mood when I listen to it. It is also quite inspirational because it encourages listeners to love themselves. Since its launch, the song has won multiple awards and has enjoyed massive success for years. For Rihanna’s career, the song gave a great boost because it was quite catchy and everyone could recognize it from the very first minutes of it playing.",
    "Different circumstances under which medical staff has worked led to varying types of leadership strategies being developed. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the role of clear communication and the handling of prompt preparation in top healthcare leaders (Nicola et al., 2020). Another key tactic includes the use of external change agents that ultimately promote excellent organizational decision-making (Alagoz et al., 2018). Moreover, one study explained how implementing positivity-related and open-minded approaches as leaders can improve their employee’s resilience, providing an additional source of motivation (Wei et al., 2018). Hence, effective healthcare leaders must adapt to various external changes and strategically communicate with their coworkers. Several departments can be interacted with through the role of a healthcare administrator. One of them includes the in-patient department where multiple approaches from skilled professionals are needed. Moreover, critical care and A&E require excellent management and collaborating opportunities. As already mentioned, the selected healthcare areas are prime examples of fields requiring strong leaders to provide optimal patient care. One way this can be improved to obtain the desired outcomes is through a holistic approach that considers external and internal factors. Furthermore, collective decision-making should not be viewed as limiting to effective leadership; on the contrary, it presents an ideal strategy in healthcare management. The importance of interprofessional collaboration in medical institutions is evident through its effect on patient outcomes. Research has demonstrated significant changes in healthcare conditions after the implementation of the strategy (Spaulding et al., 2018). The method involves acquiring knowledge from colleagues and incorporating it into one’s practice, seeking advice from the respective medical staff. Therefore, the strategy impacts the range of services professionals can offer to their patients and should be worked on further to improve its practicality.",
    "Net Present Value (NPV) reflects the amount of cash an investor or funder expects to receive from a project after inflows are recouped through all sorts of costs. This figure can be understood as the investor’s total profit generated once the payback begins. NPV gives a clear indication of whether a project is worth investing in based on likely costs and potential risk. NVP has many more advantages over other investment criteria. The rules that apply to NVP include common sense and the reasonableness of the investment and take into account return criteria. Since the calculation of NVP involves a time horizon, it is already profitable over static measures. Accordingly, the first advantage of NVP is its connection to the idea of an expected value, which will be less than at the time of investment. Unlike the payback period, NVP recognizes that the value of a currency is temporary and subject to change, so it lays this metric into the calculation of discount rates. Assumptions about the cost of capital allow the NVP to be calculated and suggest a strategy for profitable ways to implement the project. Consequently, the second advantage of this criterion is flexibility and additivity, that is, understanding the benefits of all available projects or one specific one. A third advantage may be that the calculation of NVP considers the size of the investment. This means that NVP is a unidimensional criterion that allows us to estimate the degree of probability of wealth creation based on the number of cash flows. Thus, NVP has several advantages over other investment criteria based on its application. First, NVP considers the present value of money, which gives a clear picture of cash transactions. Second, it is flexible and additive, meaning it evaluates the cost of capital and the appropriateness of the investment. Third, NVP is a one-dimensional indicator that considers all, even space investments.",
    "To properly manage business outputs, it is crucial to examine the external environment of the industry in question. The 7-Eleven organization could greatly benefit from implementing the I/O Model of Above-Average Returns, which relies on the examination of the firm’s external conditions. As such, the first stage involves the analysis of the industry and competitor environment, creating a clear picture of the general atmosphere (Hitt et al., 2007). For the 7-Eleven corporation, the competitors are such large-scale convenience stores as Walmart and Target. However, as the overall industry grows and generates a significant amount of revenue, it creates a positive atmosphere for further development. Another factor to consider is the industry’s attractiveness, as it must possess a high potential for the firm to generate above-average returns. In the current age, the convenience store segment is considered exceptionally beneficial for securing above-average returns due to the increasing demand for large-scale product distribution shops (Graves, 2017). The demand for the variety of choices and the improving financial position of American citizens suggest that the industry’s structural characteristics are quite favorable. After that, 7-Eleven would be required to select a strategy that would ensure the provision of above-average returns. A promising approach could be the implementation of the chain store method, where several branches are established across different countries. However, to apply this technique, particular assets and skills are needed (Hitt et al., 2007). The first criterion is the possession of the products and resources necessary to launch an international branch, as the costs of sustaining a new location in a different country can be demanding (Graves, 2017). In addition, the executives must account for the economic environment of the chosen state, meaning that it is vital to be skilled in international trade and branch management. Finally, to implement the selected approach, it is necessary to establish which actions will be performed to achieve the above-average returns. For 7-Eleven, it would be beneficial to use the company’s strengths in this endeavor, namely the existence of other international branches and the successful history of operations in the US (Lee, 2021). By relying on the previously obtained knowledge and integrating global expansion into the organization’s goals, 7-Eleven might perfectly utilize the formulated strategy and earn above-average returns.",
    "The suggested strategies to mitigate the effects of coronavirus in accordance with the example of Iceland could be considered as an interesting approach. This strategy acknowledges its apparent limitations, such as the resilience of the Iceland community, geographical idiosyncrasy. However, currently, this strategy might not be a valid method to address the high margins of infected individuals in NATO countries. It is certainly true that quick response and high testing rates would contribute to the deterrence of the effects imposed by the sudden growth of the number of infected. However, it is similarly meaningful that the population would be willing to undergo such a measure. Moreover, despite the financial support efforts, some countries belonging to the organization might not be able to financially withstand the high amount of testing imposed by the new waves of infection. This fact is especially relevant given that the virus dissemination might emerge across several countries simultaneously. Therefore, a different approach to the problem might be necessary. The Israeli government approached the problem of monitoring the infected with the creative solution of digital epidemiological investigation (Amit et al., 2020). This technology allowed tracking potential contacts of people that were infected and act accordingly (Amit et al., 2020). However, it is arguable that this methodology could address the geographical limitations introduced in the case of Iceland. It would be difficult for NATO countries to strictly monitor all entrances to their borders. Therefore, an analog in the form of digital tracking may solve the problem with the need for strict borders control and provide necessary tools for timely reaction to the new outbreaks. Nevertheless, it would require funds both internal and external in order to build new or reconstruct the existing infrastructure for the stated purposes.",
    "The introduced Canadian perspective on the provisional agenda of the North Atlantic Council seems to cover key points that concern Canadian security. Increased presence in the world peace operations and maintenance of tight relationships with other NATO members, especially remarkable is the smart defense approach that considers the military and economic needs of Canada. Although, it is difficult to judge the extent of the Syrian threat to Canadian interest during the outbreak of coronavirus, which seems to continue even today. Therefore, it would be essential to review the proposed question for a more effective approach to the defense of Canadian interests. Nevertheless, this act protects the interest of both Israel and Canada and will positively impact their relationship. Furthermore, it is notable how the Canadian government is willing to cooperate with the withdrawal of troops from Iraq if the official request were to be made. This statement in itself is probably a contribution to the international image of Canadian humanitarianism, but the extent of such image improvement is questionable. The focus on building trading relationships and close ties with other NATO countries could be seen as the most important aspect that Israel might acknowledge. Israel’s national security has experienced decades of varying threats, which included terrorism, missiles, and existential nuclear dangers (Freilich, 2018). However, the former national security strategy (NSS) is non-existent in the country as the first document of NSS was developed in 1953 (Freilich, 2018). Nevertheless, the country is more secure than ever before due to the political and military bonds it forms active trade agreements with various powerful countries such as the USA, China, Russia, Germany, Canada, Poland, and India (Freilich, 2018). Currently, the country exhibits great regional power and is able to prosper due to the seven-decades-old strategy.",
    "The current issue with Nike stems from its corrupt corporate culture, which puts women in a position of weakness. It allows powerful men in charge of the company to abuse and suppresses them, preventing them from reaching the positions they deserve without being harassed or denigrated. There are four potential ways of dealing with a problem: absolving, solving, resolving, and dissolving (Ackoff, 2019). Given the scope and the long-term aims for Nike and society in general, the only acceptable solution would be to dissolve it. The process of dissolution revolves around removing the underlying causes for the problem to exist in the first place. Absolving means ignoring the problem, solving – giving the women that were harmed some sort of compensation without making changes, and resolving – giving them the means to fight back without actively trying to change the toxic culture towards something better (Singh, 2018). Just allowing women to fight back is not enough – Nike should make it so that they do not have to. From an organizational framework perspective, the transformation of Nike’s culture should be done on all levels, from top to bottom. If harassment, cronyism, and corruption are acceptable at the top, there is nothing to stop them from occurring at the bottom levels (Singh, 2018). Therefore, Parker and the rest of Nike’s leadership must implement policies and solutions on all levels. This involves disincentivizing such behavior and ensuring that any potential sources of it are extinguished before they could take root again. The proposed plan of action, thus, is to conduct a massive revision of every individual employee and manager to determine their complicity in the acts that have been perpetrated in Nike for ages. All individuals found complicit should be removed from the company. That includes Mr. Parker and the rest of the board themselves, as they have been benefitting from the system while closing their eyes on it. The new leadership would be the one to implement and install a new culture based on equality, capability, and diversity.",
    "The deep socio-economic divides in American society have impacted the unemployment rates even before the COVID-19 pandemic; however, the virus has exacerbated the issue. There have been two distinct experiences during the pandemic: first, people with graduate education, who kept stable jobs through working remotely; second, those who either lost or got reduced in their jobs with no safety net (Blustein et al., 2020). The key determinants of work availability are power and privilege, unevenly divided across racial, gender, and education lines (Blustein et al., 2020). The national socio-economic gaps lie between those who have a college education and those who do not (Galea & Abdalla, 2020). Within the framework of education access, race and ethnicity represent a major division plane between Americans. The black demographic faces racism in hiring, seeking housing, and everyday life, resulting in systemic marginalization (Galea & Abdalla, 2020). Therefore, the issue of unequal job availability persists, with racial divides being particularly striking recently. Discerning socio-economic groups’ post-pandemic recovery rates from April 2020 paints a clear picture. The divide is demonstrated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (2022): there seems to be an improvement post-pandemic, with the average unemployment rate decreasing from 14.7% in April 2020 to 4% now. However, for the black population, the unemployment rate reached 16.8% in April 2020; later, stalled at 10.9% in October 2020 and then only lowered to 6.9% in January 2022 (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2022). In contrast, the white demographic presents a steady decrease within six months from April 2020; by October 2020, unemployment more than halved from 14.1% to 6.0%. Higher education, stable jobs, and support networks contribute to the higher-than-average unemployment rates for the black demographic (Galea & Abdalla, 2020). This statistic demonstrates the uneven struggle to recover from the pandemic-induced and general unemployment.",
    "Considerable musicians have represented soul music, and James Brown was one of the most prominent. Southern soul became extremely popular towards the end of the 1960s, and Brown had his first success in 1956 (Covach and Flory 218). Initially, Brown worked as a stand-in for Little Richard, and his first record, “Please Please Please,” was quite thriving (Covach and Flory 240-241). Brown used to sing lead vocals, and his early musical style resembled that of the 1950s doo-wop (Covach and Flory 242). However, he began to develop the soul style in 1960 with “Think,” characterized by horns and a driving rhythm section (Covach and Flory 242). In 1964, Brown introduced “Out of Sight,” which represented the hard-driving soul style featured in his later songs towards the 1970s (Covach and Flory 242). James Brown was one of the performers who took control of their music, as he united an aggressive style of vocal and dance performance, production skills, and understanding of business (Covach and Flory 242). Brown’s musical style through the 1960s and into the 1970s changed from following prior era’s themes to creating his unique sounds. As Brown was searching for and evolving his individual style, his career differed from Motown, Stax, or Atlantic artists and led him to produce distinguishable songs. For instance, the stops at the end of the verses in Brown’s “Papa’s Got a Brand New Bag, Pt. 1” distinct the music from a Stax arrangement (Covach and Flory 243). At the same time, the absence of background vocals in the song varies from Motown’s approach (Covach and Flory 243). Moreover, James Brown’s music was highly famous within the Black community, as, unlike Motown and Atlantic artists, Brown expressed apparent racial pride through hard-edged musical style and political lyrics (Covach and Flory 244). Brown acted passionately on his live shows as a singer, dancer, and bandleader but also hired notable musicians and rehearsed them tirelessly (Covach and Flory 240). James Brown was a remarkable performer whose vision of music and societal norms differed from other professionals.",
    "Janina’s language in the novel Drive Your Plow over the Bones of the Dead is unique in many ways, as she unravels the mystery surrounding not only the murders but her personality. However, one of the most notable traits that the reader may notice on the first page is Janina’s use of nicknames as substitutes for any person or animal’s name. While many people use nicknames for friends or people they dislike, Janina’s approach is built on her feelings towards her name and names in general. She states, “I believe each of us sees the other person in our way, so we should give them the name we consider suitable.” She considers names “polyonymous” and adheres to this rule for every character she encounters. As a result, each person that Janina talks with or about is transformed into the characteristic she sees in them. Her friend is Oddball – and from the beginning, the reader has to inherently accept that this person may be strange somehow, although it may not be accurate. Similarly, the murder victims – Big Foot, Commandant, Inner – have to be seen as the traits of appearance or status they have in Janina’s eyes. In contrast, when Janina thinks about a name for a rescue dog, her first idea is a human name, Marysia. She denies other pet names, saying that “considering her personal history” they could not be suitable for the dog. Thus, Janina thinks deeply about the animal’s life and problems, basing the name on the dog’s condition and story. By looking at the contrast between names and nicknames that Janina uses for people and animals, one can see her actual values. She loves animals while humans get judged or excluded for their oddity. Therefore, while the narrator is untrustworthy, she quickly gives away her views on the murders and exposes her potential role in them. Her nature is to judge people for their treatment of animals, and the latter is perceived as better, more worthy of saving than humans.",
    "John Smeaton was an English engineer who designed bridges, canals, and lighthouses. In the given article, written by Andrew M. A. Morris, the author demonstrates how this renowned engineer employed parameter variation in a far more broad context as part of an analytical procedure (Morris, 2021). Morris stresses the three distinct goals of such a process, including optimization, theory testing, and maxim development through exploratory testing. As the writer puts it, the fundamental point of this study is that Smeaton accomplished more than enhanced engineering processes by systematizing prior artisanal ways, as was the traditional interpretation of Smeaton’s method established by technology analysts in the 1990s (Morris, 2021). Rather, he claims that his method creates a link between science and technology by including both theory testing and practical testing (Morris, 2021). I agree with the author and believe that John Smeaton was successful at performing the traditionally seen hypothesis testing and developed empirical regularities through exploratory experimentation. While some scholars might claim that no scientific research was involved in the work of Smeaton, the engineer managed to go through a thorough analysis and create his own maxims. Morris also discussed the relationship between science and technology during the Industrial Revolution. According to Morris, the conventional understanding of it was determined by two nearly obsolete historical studies, which are reflected in the discussion between A.E. Musson, and Eric Robinson, and A. Rupert Hall (Morris, 2021). According to the first two researchers, science was an essential aspect of the industrial Era (Morris, 2021). Hall, conversely, believes that the 18th-century technical innovations attributed almost nothing to the era’s science. The way I see it, Hall’s opinion does not have a solid ground. The Industrial Revolution, in my perspective, was an amalgam of technology, science, and industry. Significant breakthroughs and technical advancements shaped nearly every present field of people’s lives while also introducing a slew of new ones. It is well known that during the early stages of the Revolution, natural forms of energy, such as wind and water, were harnessed to generate electricity. However, later, new technologies, including steam power, were investigated and improved by John Smeaton, and electricity was critical in enabling the Industrial Revolution to flourish.",
    "The percentage of uninsured people in my state, Washington, is among the lowest. Particularly, it was 6.6% as of 2019, which is considerably lower than in Oklahoma (14.9%) or Texas (18.4%) (Kaiser Family Foundation, n.d.). In my opinion, the connection between the socioeconomic status and access to care is evident. The fewer opportunities a person has in terms of financial provision, the less possible it is for them to afford high-quality health care. Individuals with low income are highly likely to be uninsured or eligible for Medicaid. As a result, such citizens do not seek health care as often as it is needed. Frequently, they only address specialists in emergency cases, neglecting many other issues that require prevention or treatment. I think that the main reason why the percentage is low in my state is because of its geographic location. There are many job opportunities in the state of Washington, which means people can afford to pay for health insurance. Also, individuals living in this state are well-informed about their options regarding health needs. Apart from that, the number of healthcare facilities is much higher than, say, in rural areas. All of these factors contribute to the high level of insured people. Speaking about the gap in quality of care and access to health care, I should also note such factors as ethnic disparities, access to education, and community context. In my state, it is easier for people from diverse backgrounds to accommodate and find support. However, there are parts of the country where some ethnic groups might be accepted with prejudice, which makes it difficult for them to pursue high-quality education and find well-paid jobs.",
    "Kantian ethics is the clearest example of non-consequential theories in philosophy, and by extension, in law. Support for the theory often comes from adherents of imperative social order ideas such as utilitarianism. In Kant’s philosophy, the ideas of non-consequential ethics are most clearly demonstrated by the moral and ethical phenomenon he formulated and called the categorical imperative. This concept, as conceived by Kant, is the formulation of how a person should act, striving to partake in genuinely moral behavior (Kant & Abbott, 2021). The imperative directly addresses the acting person, who makes specific moral choices according to the predetermined rational ways. It advises a person to strictly and urgently, most attentively, treat the maxims of their behavior, namely to the subjective rules of practical reason. According to Kant, the principles of pure practical reason have a specific non-consequential form (Kant & Abbott, 2021). They are statements containing a general definition of will, which is subject to many practical rules; this notion has particular problems in the very essence of the statement. It should be discussed how Kant understands ethics in greater detail. Namely, morality should not be relative, bound by private interests, but absolute and universal; otherwise, it does not exist at all (Kant & Abbott, 2021). In other words, relativism is the enemy of genuine morality, the contingency of principles, and adaptation to the situation. In this aspect of Kant’s philosophy, the conflict between the fundamental, strictly necessary, universal moral law, which Kant defends, and the always determined circumstances, the actions of specific people, acquires a particularly sharp form. This conflict arises at the forefront of Kant’s non-consequential ethical position. After all, a specific person cannot live and act otherwise than focusing on circumstances, building their own subjective maxims of behavior. Perhaps they have no reason to be guided by universal morality, and in this case, the universal moral law–the categorical imperative–becomes just an idea and a chimera.",
    "Labor racketeering can be defined as the illegal use of unions and authority for self-interest. Union labor corruption was perpetrated by, performed in collaboration with, or under the direction of organized criminal syndicates. The beginning of the 20th century set the foundation for labor racketeering and became a law and societal concern (Jacobs, 2020). Until the late 1970s and early 1980s, there was no systematic governmental or enforcement agencies effort to mitigate the issue (Jacobs, 2020). During prohibition, criminal groups chose to generate profit from selling illicit spirits, which maintained the alcohol demand and earnings high. When prohibition was abolished in the 1930s, the mafia’s advanced business-running methods remained (Jacobs, 2020). The most potent groups turned their focus away from alcohol to business, including narcotics, gambling, and prostitution (Jacobs, 2020). However, these were not the only money-making businesses that contributed to the profit diversification. Among other beneficial businesses for the organized crime was labor racketeering through the control of labor unions. There are many reasons why gangs prefer labor unions to other kinds of unions. For example, it can be evident from their choice to control the Teamsters and International Longshoremen’s Association (Jacobs, 2020). With the sources of such unions, members of Cosa Nostra could easily access all kinds of legitimate businesses, including waste management, construction, or demolition. Moreover, they had easy access to healthcare and pension funds from the unions. These legitimate businesses offered them ways to not only traffick illicit substances or people but also cover up their actions (Jacobs, 2020). Among other crimes, the organized groups performed extortions or threatened employers, and solicited or received bribes. Hence, it can be seen that organized crime has always tried to control local businesses and expand their influence with the help of diversification of their profits. Among the main activities of gangs were prostitution, drug trafficking, gambling, and labor racketeering. Labor unions were beneficial to organized crime due to the sources they had. Such unions gave mobsters access to legitimate demolition, construction, and waste management businesses.",
    "There are many different scientific approaches to language studies; one of them is the prescriptive method. This principle can generally be described as a set of rules that prescribe speaking or writing. Crystal (1987) notes that prescriptivism is a perspective that chooses one of the interpretations of a language as the standard and extends it to the entire society. This variation is most often found in formal speech and literature. An alternative perspective is a descriptive approach based not on standards but on the actual situation. The proponent of this method simply describes the facts of linguistic variousness (Crystal, 1987). They act as an observer, not constrained by the official framework. Although these methods are opposite in meaning, each of them can be applied in the appropriate context. Crystal (1987) notes that exploring these methods often leads to an unrealistic depiction of the opposite side, the formation of prejudice and confrontation. However, both approaches should exist together, combining the positive aspects of each other. While the prescriptive approach allows the design of society to be arranged, the descriptive approach allows the recording of real language changes (Crystal, 1987). This, in turn, allows combining logic and the natural order of things. However, not all language changes are received positively due to misconceptions. The clearest example is the belief that change means deterioration, as the old generation constantly complains (Crystal, 1987). In addition, language changes are associated with a decline in the quality of education and the negative impact of the media. Nevertheless, the author selects sufficient counterarguments to all these fears. The elders are always resentful of change, as evidenced by historical correspondence. Deterioration in the quality of education and social tension arises only if these changes occur abruptly. Nevertheless, such cases are extremely rare, so I agree with these comments. As Crystal (1987) points out, it is common for the older generation to dislike the modern world, as evidenced by the literature. The influence of the media and the quality of education is not always necessarily linked to direct language changes. Therefore, my support for this position is based on the fact that people are usually afraid of change. Most people need the consistency of developed habits and methods in life. However, language change is a natural process that is not subject to official structures and is formed together with society and its most progressive members.",
    "Changes in the global management paradigm have affected one of the most important components of management – the leadership process. The technological and information revolution has led to the fact that most businesses have the ability to scale their activities to a global scale. This gave the leaders, on the one hand, the opportunity to enter global markets. On the other hand, it led to the need to design business changes in such a way that the company was ready to win against an unlimited number of competitors at every stage of development. This implies the first requirement for a future business leader: a company mission that does not provide for the pursuit of global leadership will not lead to success. Therefore, the design of change should be based on the goal of achieving global leadership, which refers primarily to cultural management skills. No one can deny the fact that cultural differences have a significant impact on the behavior and actions of a leader. Based on this, it becomes quite obvious that these differences are usually reflected in the ways of distributing working time, decision-making, and methods of motivation. The concept of leadership is an integral element in the system of international relations, which largely determines the course of the world’s political and economic processes. According to Ratanjee (2021), “the topic of developing a global mindset and exposing leaders to multicountry and multicultural experiences is gaining increasing interest” (pp. 2). It is clear that transformational leadership in the leadership process is strongly suggested for future leaders. Bonsu and Evans (2018) state that “embracing cross-cultural transformational leadership is strategic to business growth in an era of globalization, efficiency in technology and information dissemination, and parity of education and skills” (p. 50). With discernment and charisma, transformational leaders are able to inspire those around them to change their expectations and motivations in order to move towards higher goals.",
    "Goals and objectives outline desired outcomes and, thus, are often used interchangeably. However, the effect, timeframe, and specificity of the two terms set them apart. Nickels et al. (2019) define goals as broad and long-term outcomes that an organization seeks, while objectives define the measurable, specific, and short-term strategies for attaining the identified goal. For example, the criminal justice system uses goals to task the police, correctional agencies, and the court with the strategy to execute, including deterrence, rehabilitation, retribution, restoration, and incapacitation. Therefore, the criminal justice system particularly addresses criminal behavior with the objective of protecting people’s rights. In an era of rapid change, diversity, and complexity, leadership and management are critical to the survival of any agency. Besides, the ability to lead and manage strongly permeates every aspect of the criminal justice system. While leaders guide the change through a vision, managers implement coordinated processes and structures to pursue organizational goals and objectives (Nickels et al., 2019). Leaders are constantly challenged to take risks and encourage transformation. In law enforcement, for example, police leaders must develop and instill high standards in other officers to work toward the same goal. Beyond leadership, criminal justice relies on managers to optimize processes and lead efforts toward reliable outcomes. Generally, criminal justice leaders and managers work effectively to balance ethical and legal considerations. Earning a degree in criminal justice would significantly contribute to meeting my long-term goals. I have always taken pride in influencing change as a leader. However, I must leverage my education with experience in the criminal justice system to become more efficient and productive. The criminal justice system is becoming increasingly complex and requires more lasting and transformative trends. As such, the second goal is to become more adaptable to change. Bringing significant change through robust analytical skills is an objective in itself. Also, gaining strong relational skills to work with professionals and serve people from diverse backgrounds.",
    "The phrase that caught me most from the video is from Isaiah, stating that Samuel has taught him that one person can play t-ball and hit it hard when sitting down. This is a powerful statement indicating that people can be prejudiced despite having good intentions. Samuel’s family did not realize the struggles disabled people go through before he was born (PinehurstPictures, 2010). The child’s image hitting the t-ball also showcased a powerful issue, that disabled individuals should be treated similarly to other people and given equal opportunities to give them the chance to perform optimally. I was intrigued to see children like Nathanial Orellana learning in a normal classroom. His mother determined they sought school actively to ensure he received the best care considering his autism (PinehurstPictures, 2010). Parents face a myriad of extra challenges raising disabled children to give them advantages that would help them compete with their peers in society. The video illustrates that communities and the government should provide parents with a variety of schools to determine the best for their child’s disability. Children with disabilities require special care but should be allowed to interact with others if their illness would not worsen based on these connections. Engagement is a crucial tool for child development as it requires them to be attentive and active, propagating greater achievement due to increased enthusiasm. Nathanial raises his hand to answer a question because each student is engaged in the classroom. His enthusiasm to answer the question shows interest and a desire to learn, traits associated with high achievement. The video is helpful because it provides a glimpse of the life individuals with disabilities pass through. Many of these parents face issues with education as they would like their children to receive the best education while also avoiding the pitfalls that other children do not face. Emily, a mental health advocate, has schizophrenia and discerns that people without the illness cannot fully understand their plight (PinehurstPictures, 2010). In this aspect, people without developmental problems may not see the issues they face and should work hard to help them optimally function in society. Keith Jones also showcases an important faction of society. He claims that individuals should not expect children to develop good social skills if they stay for eight hours in a classroom without adequate interaction (PinehurstPictures, 2010). It is crucial to recognize that inclusion would work well if children were given a chance to interact frequently despite their differences.",
    "The article’s thesis statement is supported by the further reading authors investigating the case of a strange change in Professor Wilson’s lifestyle. Indeed, the reasoning behind such a decision was complex, and it includes elements of achieving maximum sustainability in the tiniest space possible. In addition, the article mentions that he shares his experiences during the nights when his ecology-focused students are invited to stay in the dumpster with him. The article caught my attention with a few details. First of all, the scenario where a respected scholar lives in the dumpster reminded me of an Ancient Greek philosopher Diogenes who lived in the barrel. Hence, it was interesting to investigate the topic and find if there are any similarities between the two. Furthermore, giving personal details and the personal background of the divorced professor added a bit of psychological interest to it. I wondered if the divorce affects men so severely that they are ready for such a downshift. But these are all subconscious thoughts and triggers. The visuals in the article were crucial to me because I felt a little tired when I started reading. Hence, being able to scroll down and see the pictures of the dumpster, pictures of day-to-day activities, and the interior of the dumpster was a way of relaxing and thinking about the subject. After looking at pictures, I had some questions; therefore, I had a personal interest in reading the article to find the answers. Honestly, the interior of the dumpster does not look that bad, and the best thing is that Wilson is able to lay there comfortably. Therefore, personally, living in a dumpster is an option for times when I feel like I need to be alone. But lack of commodities associated with the home kitchen and bathroom is why I could not choose the dumpster as a place of my permanent residence.",
    "Both lookism and extreme body modification are inherently linked to unhealthy and unrealistic beauty standards of modern society. This trait aside, however, the two are very different in its manifestations and direct consequences. Lookism is merely the act of considering someone whose appearance is not what most people would regard to be beautiful. It focuses on exhibiting negative judgement to people that do not fit the standard and is thus oriented outside of the person who engages in it. Extreme body modification is the act of changing one’s body in order to look in a way that deviates from the norms that society sets on appearance (Good, 2016). To contrast these two, one does not look pleasing in appearance, while the other intentionally marks oneself in ways that others would perceive as deviances or outside of societal standards. The differences between the two stem from their external or internal angles, despite both being related to the dissatisfaction with appearance. It is likely that a person who engages in lookism is deeply insecure about their own beauty, and thus takes a judgemental stance towards the beauty of others. Obsessiveness over other peoples’ features or grooming habits generally signals a very unhealthy relationship with self-image, despite being less visible than bodily modifications (Good, 2016). Meanwhile, said modifications can happen both by a person’s own accord, and as an act of social pressure or custom. An example of the latter would be an ancient Chinese tradition of binding female feet to make them small and rose-like in their shape. More often then not, the expectations of extreme bodily modifications are placed on women, who are expected to conform to them in certain cultures to uphold their respectability and perceived marital value.",
    "The Prince, written by Nicholas Machiavelli, is an important contribution to the modern concept of politics. In a sense, this work contradicts the philosophical tradition of ancient political thought in which political practice is overshadowed by the idealization of governments and utopian cities. On the contrary, in Prince, Machiavelli (2014) establishes that the real implementation of politics implies real situations with real people whose behavior, decisions and actions usually are not necessarily moral. The main theme of “The Prince” by Machiavelli is monarchical rule and survival. This work was regarded as a guide for politicians on the use of ruthless, self-serving cunning and inspired the term “Machiavellian”. Machiavelli (2014) discusses in detail how a ruler should act in various situations or circumstances and establishes that the main goal of politics is the successful retention of power. The book had a lasting effect on political thought since in it, Machiavelli opposed the traditional attitude to politics that serves the people to a benign self-interest, where the ruler is self-centered and focused on his goals. The book justifies any means as long as they help the governor to achieve his aims. According to Hobbes, people are egoistic, greedy, and seek personal gain. Egoism is declared to be the main incentive of human activity. But Hobbes does not condemn people for their selfish inclinations, does not believe that they are evil by nature. Many people find Hobbes’ view cynical as it is too simplified and not all actions can be explained by egoism. For example, there are a lot of people and charity organizations that donate their money and time for free without any personal gain. As for me, I find human nature infinitely more complex than power-seeking individuals described in Hobbes’s work.",
    "Levels of culture can be displayed in different planes and depths. According to Edgar Shein, who developed the concept ‘levels of organizational culture,’ and Edward Granter who later expanded on this concept, the culture of the entity can be seen in four levels: super-structural, symbolic, discursive, and cognitive (Granter, 2019). In other words, the levels of culture in enterprises are developed due to external economic and social influences, artifacts such as logos, story rituals and events, values explicitly expressed by the organization, and underlying assumptions. This paper aims to assess the levels of organizational culture for Macomb Community College. Artifacts in Macomb Community College show that it promotes concentration, attentiveness, and responsibility, which is reflected in the logo. Looking at the architecture of the buildings, some of which use chrome-plated modern high-tech structures, one can assume that technology and science are the main focus of educational programs. Nonetheless, the central older building and a park with large trees create an atmosphere of solitude and introspection, which is more in line with the study of fine arts and social sciences. Equally important, the college has a high culture of mutual help and respect and cherishes community relations, which is reflected in the developed bus route system available to students. On the value level, many signs within the college, including parking signs, library signs, and other clues, point to a love of order and organization. Probably in this college, teachers appreciate the composure and commitment shown by students. On the level of assumptions, the college probably seeks to avoid accepting students who are overly self-expressive or whose identity is tied to superficial popular culture. The college website lacks flashy headlines or programs offering to participate in the community in a frivolous way, such as selling cookies for fundraising or taking part in field trips. Thus, the levels of organizational culture at the Macomb Community College were assessed. The college has a clear identity at the level of artifacts and values. At the same time, the analysis of underlying assumptions suggests several recommendations. Perhaps, the college underestimates the importance of openness in relationships and is too harsh on manifestations of superficial identity or judgment. Given the high commitment to social and community values, Macomb Community College members should consider that openness is an important value for building good social connections.",
    "The story of King Uruk, or Gilgamesh, is widely recognized as the first known explanation of the relationship between humans and gods. In other words, The Epic of Gilgamesh is the first mention of mythology in our world. To be more exact, the piece’s primary focus is on King Uruk’s transformation from a horrible ruler to a kind one when he is forced to face mortality. As stated, the main character of this story is the King of Uruk, who now serves as a reminder that in the early times, humans used to feel the same as we did. According to Anneberg Learner (2021), this writing is older than Bible since it is “four thousand years old in its oldest form.” Therefore, The Epic of Gilgamesh describes the life of Uruk’s ruler, above all other kings, considering that he was special, “he was two-thirds divine and one-third human” (Anneberg Learner, 2021). However, when the gods realized that they could not handle such an arrogant ruler, they sent Gilgamesh’s copy, Enkidu. Finally, the King of Uruk realized the significance of social interaction, “wonderful about being engaged with another human being” (Anneberg Learner, 2021). It is significant to note that Enkidu actually started the same way as Adam and, consequently, was humanized by the prostitute sent by the gods. Still, one fatal mistake of Enkidu and Gilgamesh leads to the first’s inevitable death, and when the King of Uruk realizes that his friend is dead, he starts seeking immortality. Overall, the story’s main idea is that the gods created immortality only for themselves, while humans will always be followed by death. Eventually, as Gilgamesh’s chance to live forever was stolen by a serpent, he finally realized his treasure, knowing the past and ability to return back to his city. At the end of the story, the town survives its ruler, which is why such a powerful message leads to the human population remembering it ever since.",
    "Motivation is the process whereby an individual’s endeavors are stimulated, guided, and maintained toward achieving a goal. Thus, the responsibility of management is to monitor and direct workers in a company (Usmonovich, 2021). This is required since it is a method of inducing individuals to work, which they are capable and equipped to do freely. Even though most people have to work for a livelihood and a job is an essential part of everyone’s lives, administrators must be apprehensive about employee motivation concerns for various reasons. Managers have several valid reasons to be concerned about motivating employees. Firstly, individual success in a company is viewed as a product of talent and inspiration. Additionally, the ability is influenced by education, expertise, and learning, and its development is a difficult and laborious process, whereas motivation may be accelerated (Usmonovich, 2021). Thus, employee motivation is widely recognized as critical to a corporation’s success. In addition, a business that struggles with staff motivation is more likely to experience lower output, defective manufacturing, or other problems, and managers must guarantee that this does not happen (Usmonovich, 2021). Secondly, an administrator’s role in the company is to get tasks completed through staff. In order to sustain desired objectives, thus, leaders need to be able to notice the decreasing engagement and improve staff morale. To comprehend motivation, one must first recognize fundamental human nature, which may be both complicated and straightforward at the same time (Usmonovich, 2021). Understanding and appreciating the above is a necessity for successful employee motivation in the workplace, as well as good management and organizational achievement. Thirdly, a business is less likely to fulfill its goals if its personnel is not entirely committed. When people lose interest in their employment, organizations will see a commensurate drop in determination, invention, and productivity. The leadership that declines to confront these issues immediately endangers their job, as the firm relies on them to guarantee that employees regularly perform at a high level (Usmonovich, 2021). Thus, managers must be familiar with motivational strategies as well as comprehend their workers’ unique peculiarities and views to select incentives that will effectively motivate them to work together to achieve the organization’s goals.",
    "This tote is perfect for mothers with teenage children who are constantly on the go but want to look stylish while doing errands and during family activities. It is high-end yet durable and keeps the owner’s personal belongings organized in a portable and secure way, making it easier to get outside in the shortest time. Product Selection According to the survey data, in the target audience, the most popular brands are Channel, Pucci, and Kate Shade. Therefore, the audience is torn between products in which the quality matches the price and luxury products with unreasonable prices. In order to justify the high-end price, it might be helpful to use a high-quality leather material and equip the bag with extra pockets for organized storage, as most luxury bags miss that feature. As survey results suggest that the target audience mostly prefers shoulder bags or tote bags, providing an additional shoulder strap will offer a more substantial basis for the price. Most survey participants have three to five bags, meaning that they prefer to have one bag that will suit all occasions, including everyday use, rather than a wide variety of different bags in different styles. Combining the collected conclusions leads to the black bag option in size 9×11 made from leather with 36$ production cost. Pricing The survey results suggest that most of the target audience can afford the price from 300$ to 700$, and most prefer to shop online for handbags. Considering the target audience’s income, it is more likely that a bag with a high mid-range price will be more popular as its price can be justified, unlike luxury bag prices. The closest alternative in mid-range price from All Tote Bags On Shelves research is Ralph Lauren Carlyle Mini Leather Zip Tote Bag with a 195$ pricing. Therefore, setting the future product’s price around 250$ will result in a fair price for the customers for the products’ quality. The price will also provide additional revenue for Buhi that the company can spend on additional accessories and product packaging to create a more luxurious feel.",
    "Marx’s thesis on the fetishism of commodities focuses on society’s tendency to place value on commodities based on contributed labor, which inevitably causes domination of the products over people. Furthermore, the fetishism affects the social interactions between the customer and producer: the valued objects are independently exchanged for the respective purposes. Such exchanges of objects occur independently of human needs or decisions (Ritzer, 2011). In this case, it is essential to note that the term fetishism does not suggest any sexual connotations; it only explains people’s inclination to devote themselves to the mentioned principles. In modern society, we have fetishized technological trends in the same way that Marx’s thesis suggests. For example, Apple products are known to be highly appreciated for their “high-quality” and “accessibility”. The labor that goes into creating the products, despite sometimes being considered unethical, benefits the brand’s overall image. Since hours and hundreds of workers are dedicated to producing the items, their values increase independently of their quality. The product’s value is then highly dependent on the importance placed by the general public and marketing strategies rather than its original worth. Moreover, the workers that are required for the brand’s success also become commodities, as mentioned in the Manifesto of the Communist Party (Marx & Engels, 1818-1883). In this way, although existing independently of one another, all major parts of the modern socio-economic system become disconnected from their actual worth. Marx’s thesis fails to explore how a commodity gains its value purely from the amount of labor included in the process. This could be outlined as a critical disadvantage to the thesis, as it ignores a central perspective that aid in changing the materialistic values of society. Another detail that was not mentioned in Marx’s work is related to the nature of commodities, why some are more valued than others. Still, the Manifesto of the Communist Party and Marx’s thesis provide a solid foundation for analyzing modern socio-economic relations.",
    "Mary Breckinridge was a strong individual who, despite all her suffering and terrible losses, dedicated her life to helping people and preventing others from experiencing the disasters that she had encountered. During her lifetime, she made a tremendous impact in the development of nursing and medical research. These are the reasons why I want to write about Mary Breckinridge and her achievements. Mary Breckinridge was born February 17, 1881, in Memphis, Tennessee, but raised in many places, including Kentucky, New York, and even St. Petersburg, since her father was a congressman and U.S Minister to Russia (Breckinridge, 2021). In 1904, after her first husband died, she decided to become a nurse (Breckinridge, 2021). Mary still tried to create a family afterward, and after ten years of nursing, she retired and gave birth to a son and a daughter from her second husband (Breckinridge, 2021). However, the tragedies continued to follow Mary, and her children died soon after the birth (Breckinridge, 2021). After the disasters, she left her husband and volunteered as a nurse in World War I, finally deciding to devote her life to saving lives (Breckinridge, 2021). After the war, Mary worked mainly in Kentucky and continued her education at the Teachers College of Columbia University in New York City (Breckinridge, 2021). In 1923, she went to England to study at the British Hospital for Mothers and Babies to become a qualified midwife (Breckinridge, 2021). Also, in 1925, she established a private charitable organization, the Frontier Nursing Service (FNC), which significantly decreased both maternal and infant mortality in the area of service (Brewer, 2018). During her life, Mary significantly contributed to nursing and helped many people. Apart from the FNC that still operates in southeastern Kentucky, she was recognized as the first who introduced nurse-midwifery to the United States (Brewer, 2018). It is worth mentioning that Mary’s impact on midwifery and nursing education continued even after her death. Today, people from around the world come to the FNC School of Midwifery and Family Nursing to study her model of rural health and social service delivery (Brewer, 2018). It is hard not to admire Mary Breckinridge for her contribution to nursing, despite all the tragedies she encountered. Even after losing her kids, Mary did not let the disaster break her spirit but devoted herself to reducing suffering from other people’s lives. I truly believe that everyone can learn from her example.",
    "The introduction of new levels of nursing education is a major reform that has contributed to the complexity of the field. Traditionally, nursing schools provided degrees of a Bachelor’s level associated with the basic skills required by this profession. However, today, aspiring nurses have access to high-quality Master’s programs that further develop their competencies. In this regard, a question may reasonably arise regarding the actual value of such degrees. In fact, Master’s programs in nursing are essential for healthcare, as they align with the growing importance of nurses and the contemporary view of the system. Bachelor’s degrees provide students with the basics of the profession, its fundamental concepts and practical skills. These aspects alone form a full-fledged, competent nurse who is capable of doing their job. In other words, a Bachelor’s degree cannot be considered an “incomplete” education in nursing. At the same time, Master’s programs serve as the development impetus for those who want to engage with more sophisticated principles of 21 st -century nursing. First of all, Master’s degrees are aimed at the manner in which nurses think. More specifically, such programs promote critical thinking and cognitive agility that is required to make precise decisions in difficult situations. Thus, a certain leadership dimension is introduced, allowing nurses to enter the healthcare decision-making framework while understanding the social dimension of the issues to address (Bryant-Moore et al., 2018). Second, a Master’s in nursing supports the development of emotional intelligence, which is integral to patient-centered care. By employing critical thinking, nurses learn to analyze each case objectively and master the emotional aspect that enables strong patient connection (Cassano et al., 2020). Third, a Master’s in nursing is a major step toward proficiency in scientific research, through which nurses help to build a better system for tomorrow. Overall, Master’s programs complement the fundamental skills of each professional by a stronger presence of cognitive, emotional, and research competencies that support the emergence of nursing leaders within the professional community.",
    "Mearsheimer justifies the reasons for Modern European war by the existence and disposition of poles of power, which affect the determination of states to engage in hostilities. He considers the multipolar system the most conducive to rivalry because states’ authority is not distributed evenly (Mearsheimer, 2014). Furthermore, it is most predisposed to instability, as relations between countries change from hostile to sociable and vice versa. Such frequent transformations contribute to the constant emergence of wars. Moreover, they prevent a rational assessment of the capabilities and intentions of adversaries. An unbalanced multipolarity is the most unbalanced form because it is characterized by a hegemon pursuing as much power as feasible. Other states are fearful of such urges, and therefore their policies can be more aggressive. Mearsheimer (2014) argues that wars in modern Europe under a bipolar order occurred with minimal frequency. This system is the most steady because there is a balance between the countries, contributing to their mutual understanding. However, Mearsheimer’s concept cannot be applied nowadays because it is challenging to define the current world order. It is evident that multipolarity prevails and establishes the course of action. Still, it is closely intertwined with bipolarity, which indicates that the modern world is a unique system with dissimilar approaches and impacts. This connection distinguishes the current state of the world structure from the previous one. Therefore, one cannot associate the reasons for military conflicts solely with a specific system. Mearsheimer’s ideas regarding the grounds for wars are rational and reasonable. Nevertheless, the author doubts them because of the nuclear weapon, which existed when Europe was bipolar (Mearsheimer, 2014). It was not present in multipolar order, and therefore the arguments are not valid as the atomic weapon is one of the world’s most significant forces. Mearsheimer (2014) suggested that it, not the system, could be the foremost reason for the absence of war in bipolar Europe between 1990 and 1945. The balance of power cannot affect the outbreak of war as much as the fear of nuclear annihilation.",
    "Melanoma is generally recognized as one of the cancers that have an increasing cover percentage, though it is usually diagnosed at early stages. Recently, the ways of melanoma treatment for patients with metastatic disease were so limited that many patients were practically doomed. Fortunately, melanoma therapeutics have developed for the past decade because of the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors. Now, people with stages II and III may easily have a long period of remission. Therefore, modern options for melanoma treatment serve as a source of hope for numerous people. Indeed, innovations in the sphere of melanoma treatment are connected with the use of checkpoint inhibitors and the so-called adjuvant therapy. According to recent research, “the use of anti–CTLA-4 and anti-PD1 immune checkpoint inhibitors and combination BRAF/MEK inhibitors for patients with BRAF V600 mutations has significantly extended survival and allowed some patients to remain in durable disease remission off therapy” (Poklepovic & Luke, 2019, p. 1166). This means that the so-called “low-risk” patients with stage IIA through IIC melanoma like Mr. B. from the question may have a long remission after receiving a special course. Still, patients in remission should better keep healthy with adjuvant therapies. A decade ago, such kind of additional treatment was frequently considered of marginal effects for earlier stage melanoma because of interferon-α2b (IFN). It turned out that “the substantial associated toxicity of that interferon and other treatments, such as the anti-CTLA4 antibody ipilimumab” (Jenkins & Fisher, 2021, p. 27). Therefore, it used to be of little trust for many efficient doctors. Moreover, as far as stage II is concerned, the lower incidence of disease progression calls for unprecedented efficacy (Rozeman et al., 2018). However, with time, adjuvant therapies became recognized in the sphere of cancer treatment. The case of Mr. B may be the one where adjuvant therapy could have prevented the biopsy from coming back to stage II melanoma.",
    "Although mentoring is a relatively new term within church circles, it has been practiced widely in Christian communities for years. Across many churches, spiritual coaching, directorship, discipleship, and friendship have been implemented in a mostly unstructured form, necessitating the need to formulate standard skills and methods for mentors for better outcomes. According to Mallison (1998), Christian coaching encompasses the development of disciples and leaders through sound instructions and encouragement, which are founded on God’s will and biblical teachings. The author defines Christian mentoring as “a dynamic, intentional relationship of trust in which one person enables another to maximize the grace of God in their life and service” (Mallison, 1998, p. 8). The author’s predominant theme is that mentorship is not optional if Christians intend to grow and the criticality of taking an interest in the progress of others. Christian-based mentoring integrates various spiritual components, aspects, and the bible as the principal ingredients. By presenting Jesus as the prime mentoring model, Mallison’s (1998) central premise is that Christians should be concerned in the spiritual and personal growth of others since Christianity is relational and collectivist. The author emphasizes the concepts of community and interdependence by describing “a Christian wanting to live in isolation as a pious particle” (Mallison, 1998, p. 34). However, the author’s notable refutation is that despite integrating all the critical ingredients and observing the foundational principles, Christian mentoring is futile if not underlined by a genuine desire to see the mentor advance spiritually. Mentorship and developing an interest in the spiritual and personal growth of others are indispensable if Christians are keen on growing deeper in their spirituality. For instance, Christian fellowships should allocate responsible and dependable persons to mentor new disciples due to their reliability and genuine concern for the mentees’ progress (Mallison, 1998). One of the publication’s key implications is the critical significance of a properly structured and biblically inspired coaching program. This implies that Christian mentorship models should generate disciples and leaders who then would continue propagating the gospel. Notable critiques in the book include the exclusive dependence on the bible as the source of information for analysis. Additionally, there is limited exploration of the relationship of spiritual friends and the spiritual directors with the mentors and the absent views on mentor damage. The author also accentuates his views by drawing comparisons from other works and the extensive integration of biblical insights. A question arising from the publication is how the Christian model of mentoring can remedy destructive coaching.",
    "The study of what rhetorical tools public personalities use in their speech can be a beneficial aspect to study. With its help, people can get an understanding of how, when, and where people can use rhetorical components. This work aims to study Michelle Obama’s opening remarks at the White House Convention on Food Marketing to Children. The main message of the First Lady was to draw attention to the suppression of the advertising of unhealthy food to minors. In addition, the main appeals that Obama uses are logic and emotional. The first aspect of rhetoric used in this speech is logic. It implies the justification and reasons for a particular action or event. Michele Obama stated that “between 2008 and 2011, obesity rates among low-income preschoolers dropped in 19 states and territories across the country” (Read Michelle Obama’s Speech on Food Marketing para. 10). Therefore, Obama provides a justification of how important it is for television changes to encourage a proper lifestyle among the younger generation. The next valuable component of rhetoric in the studied speech of the first lady is the emotional aspect. Thus, Obama emphasizes that “while we have made important progress, when one in three kids is still on track to develop diabetes, and when the diet has now surpassed smoking” (Read Michelle Obama’s Speech on Food Marketing para. 11). In this case, Michele Obama points to the positive results already achieved while also highlighting that children are still at risk. In conclusion, this work was engaged in analyzing Michelle Obama’s speech on the topic of the harm of the media for introducing the younger generation to healthy habits. To better convey the main idea, the first lady used such components of rhetoric as logic and emotion. They helped to better form and give important information, gave the speech solidity, and improved the audience’s ability to persuade.",
    "Globalization has indeed become a significant pattern in the development of geopolitical and cultural practices of recent decades. With the advent of the Internet, people have become connected, even across continents: such a powerful catalyst could not fail to have a necessary consequence. In particular, people from different countries and cultures have become more integrated into a common, emerging culture in which there is room for the traditions of all peoples. Meanwhile, the representation of different cultures in this common one is unequal, which means that stronger national cultures can absorb weaker ones. A natural reaction to the unification of people was the growth of nationalistic sentiments among peoples whose cultures tend to be weaker. Thus, the spread of American sentiment (and especially the American dream) to the world often results in people from other regions becoming indifferent to their culture. In addition, globalization can lead to the destruction of the sovereignty of vulnerable communities: for example, if the big powers (the United States, China, Russia, Britain) suppress the development of small neighboring ones (Hawaii, Hong Kong, Abkhazia, or former British colonies). Healthy nationalism is not a problem because communities desire to protect themselves and preserve their cultural and political independence. However, radical, violent actions on the part of nationalists lead to international conflicts and inhibit globalization. Thus, globalization should not be evaluated regarding whether it is good or bad. Instead, it should be seen as a natural milestone in the evolution of humanity. Globalization does have advantages and disadvantages, but it is a fact in and of itself. The world now finds itself incredibly integrated, as every individual can learn news from another continent, listen to foreign music, and read non-domestic literature in a matter of minutes. This results in a new, shared culture. In this state, radical nationalism is a serious problem that society and governments must confront.",
    "There is no simple answer to what it means to be human. Some might say that being human means being independent and controlling their personal lives. For other people, being human means utilizing the refinements of civilization, wearing clothes, and going to work every day, i.e., doing everything that animals cannot do. It is also complicated to say how people want to live because everyone has unique requirements, dreams, and thoughts on this issue. This essay reflects on the On Being podcast and answers the above questions. In the podcast, Thich Nhat Hanh explains why people need to be human. According to him, “we have to remain human to be able to understand and to be compassionate” (Onbeing.org 30:53 – 30:58). The monk adds that being human means having a right to make mistakes, but the absence of a “right to continue making mistakes” (Onbeing.org 31:15 – 31:20). Therefore, being human means being mindful, responsible, and open-hearted. In other words, being human is about being humane. People live in a world of violence and terror and cannot even talk to each other effectively (Onbeing.org). Consequently, they fail to understand which way of living is genuine. From the words of Thich Nhat Hanh, it could be inferred that people want to live without anger; they want to live mindfully and be in control of their emotions. Nonetheless, an average modern person could hardly achieve this way of living. Overall, the podcast is immensely inspiring since it is dedicated to being human, problems people face in the modern mad world, and ways to avoid them. The Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh creates an impression of a conscious person whose ideas should be taken seriously. Even though I do not share the Buddhist worldview, I deeply admire the personality of Thich Nhat Hanh since he inspired me to learn more about mindfulness practices.",
    "“The Passing of Traditional Societies” is based on empirical material obtained from fieldwork and interviews conducted over a decade in Turkey, Lebanon, Syria, Egypt, Jordan, and Iran. Lerner proceeded from the fact that in the process of modernization, all societies move in the same direction, which was set by the Western countries that had completed modernization earlier. However, this “Western model,” according to Lerner, is, in fact, global. It acquired its name only due to a historical confluence of circumstances. Countries of the North Atlantic were the first to carry out the processes of secularization, urbanization, and industrialization. Analyzing the modernization of lifestyles based on empirical material, Lerner pays the most attention to the growth of population mobility, the spread of literacy, and the mass media. For example, Lerner dwelled on the problem of restrictions for modernization. Among the most critical factors hindering development, he attributed ethnocentrism. Lerner states, “From the West came the stimuli which undermined traditional society in the Middle East; for the reconstruction of a modern society that will operate efficiently” (Lerner 47). The author contrasts societies, at the same time declaring that the focus on cultural identity impedes progress. I believe that this concept of modernization designed to solve the problems of transition from “backwardness” to “modernity” was a specific product of the era after the Second World War. Built on numerous simplifications, the modernization theory interprets the historical process as one-line and non-alternative (Dunmire 23). The paradigm proposed by Lerner does not explain the development principles of many countries, such as China, Russia, or Cuba, and therefore loses its relevance in modern days.",
    "The clothing industry is amongst the many monopolistically competitive industries. There are many clothing firms in the industry competing against each other while producing similar products. However, the firms in the industry earn competitive advantages by distinguishing their products through branding and advertisements (Davis and Özgür, 4). Product differentiation is one of the strategies commonly used by monopolistic competitive firms. Product differentiation in a clothing firm can involve designs, the quality of materials used, and the prices charged for the clothes. In advertisements, differentiation is put in physical aspects such as color, designs, elastic, and different sizes (Davis and Özgür, 7). Intangible aspects included in the clothing advertisement can be guaranteed money back, high quality, free delivery, and long-lasting usage. Steel manufacturing is an example of an oligopolistic competitive industry. In such a market, a few steel manufacturing companies rule over other firms. The few firms are the price and trendsetters for other small companies and often form a partnership to operate successfully (Ritz 185). To distinguish themselves from their competitors, they improve their product quality, hike or lower prices, and advertise the special features of their products. In an oligopolistic market, if a leading company lowers prices, the others do not follow but rather improve their products to remain in the higher cuts of prices (Ritz 187). The few leading companies also stay competitive in the industry by setting their standards high to prevent easy entry into the industry. The firms set high standards by producing the highest quality products, selling them at a higher price, and producing them in high quantities (Ritz 189). That way, they ensure that the small or new companies fear the competition at the top thus ensuring reduced entry to the industry.",
    "Moral relativism claims that morality is not based on any absolute standard. According to moral relativism, ethical truth is more likely to come from situations, cultures, and sensations. The source of moral universalism is considered human nature, particularly the susceptibility of a person, the ability to empathize, and the resulting need for argumentation for persuasion. The two moral concepts are opposed, but moral universalism seems to be more truthful. Several arguments can be made concerning moral relativism that reflect a dubious nature. Firstly, while many of the arguments that insist on supporting relativism may seem compelling, they all have a logical contradiction in that they all return the correct moral schema that all people should follow, which constitutes moral universalism. Secondly, relativists may argue that different cultures have different values and that morality is relative to different people. However, these arguments explain people’s actions in terms of absolute standards, so it converges back to moral universalism. Moral universalism presupposes the existence of an ethical system that effectively regulates the behavior of members of any community, regardless of culture, race, gender, religion, nationality, sexual orientation, or any other distinguishing features. The simplest justification for this point of view is the obvious observation that in all known moral codes that have proven their viability, there is a common core: respect for life, health, property, and personal dignity. Moral universalism seems to be the more truthful theory. Firstly, moral relativism is built on exceptions, not on general rules. All people approach morality from human nature, which explains approximately the same moral and ethical codes of all countries and peoples. Moral norms are considered basic everywhere, for example, the prohibition of murder. Secondly, if everyone had their own morality and ethics, as moral relativism suggests, it would be impossible to regulate human relations.",
    "“Interpreter of Maladies” introduces the reader to a collapsing world of a dysfunctional family. In the novel, Mr. Das sparks both sympathy and a sense of slight annoyance that is likely to transform into disdain after considering the evolution of his character. Although the character might seem benevolent and sympathetic at first, his evident inability to emotionally connect with his wife or children indicates the need for further evolution, which never occurs. At first glance, Mr. Das represents a character that is easy to empathize with and relate to due to his kind nature. Indeed, Mr. Das is mostly benevolent and kind-hearted throughout the novel. For example, he is never aggressive or unkind to his wife, her mostly being the one to start a confrontation: “’But they’re harmless,’ Mr. Das said” (Lahiri). However, Mr. Das should not be seen as immediately redeemable. Specifically, on a closer look, Mr. Das’ unwillingness to interact with his wife or children becomes evident. For instance, when Mr. Kapasi starts talking to the couple., Mr. Das chooses to avoid the conversation. Namely, he chooses to read a book instead: “Mr. Das was absorbed by his tour book, so it seemed like a private conversation between Mr. Kapasi and Mrs. Das” (Lahiri). Therefore, Mr. Das clearly distances himself from his wife and, by extension, from his children, creating a further rift in their relationship. Therefore, the failure to acknowledge and address a problem represents a major obstacle in Mr. Das’ character development. as a result, he never grows throughout the novel, remaining in the same infant state of blissful ignorance. Thus, his intentionally turning a blind eye to the unhappiness of his family members makes him not as sympathetic as he might have seemed at first. Failing miserably to notice the presence of alienation between him and his wife, as well as his children, Mr. Das elicits emotions that gradually deny the reader the expected empathy and, instead, see him as desperately flawed. Even though the problems in Mr. Das’ perception of his marriage and his children are quite understandable, humanizing him and making him relatable, his inability, or unwillingness, to recognize the problem and tackle it leads to the reader’s bitter disappointment. Thus, with his complexity and contradictory nature, Mr. Das and his character arc teach the reader an important lesson about the need for introspection and acknowledging reality.",
    "The article represents an overview of other literature on methodologies and criteria used in supplier evaluation and selection process, which is believed to be one of the vital components of a successful operation of a manufacturing company. In particular, the paper emphasized the industry’s change in this field – from focusing primarily on operational efficiency to embracing the potential of strategic partnerships. The article claims that the right approach to supplier assessment, thus, is the key to a company’s development and progress. The paper starts with various ways to address the issues related to MCDM of suppliers’ selection. The most common ones are stated to be mathematical models, Simple multi-attribute rating technique (SMART), analytic network process (ANP), analytic hierarchy process (AHP), data envelopment analysis (DEA), linear programming, and some others. For example, DEA is a methodology focused on a supplier system and classifies it either as efficient or inefficient based on selecting particular criteria. Mathematical programming models usually incorporate complex evaluations between suppliers, allowing one to compare them and identify the most optimal in terms of cost and other criteria. The article further compares all methodologies by their popularity expressed in the frequency of mentions in the literature. Thus, DEA is the most common approach with 30% mentions, whereas mathematical programming (17%), AHP (15%), and case-based reasoning account for fewer mentions. However, those methodologies represent the largest share of all MCDM approaches. The article highlights the significance of knowing this distribution, which can build an idea of the most prominent ways to address the issues with suppliers’ assessment and selection. It is also stated that suppliers should be evaluated based on “the inputs of the strategic, functional and operational levels” (Agarwal et al., 2011). Methodologies such as DEA, mathematical programming, or AHP are advised to be used for identifying the most optimal suppliers, whereas AHP is noted to be effective in providing consistency.",
    "Ancient Rome could be described as multicultural, largely due to the significant areas of land that the Roman Empire controlled at various points, often integrating the local populations and cultures into their own. A wide variety of cultures existed within the borders of the Roman civilization and the Roman population was found to have incredible genetic diversity, having more in common with the Mediterranean states rather than Western Europe (Thomsen, 2019). Some of the cultures that were present under Roman rule include the Gauls, Greeks, Syrian, Egyptian, Lebanese, Persia, and many others. Scholars attribute the cultural and economic success of Rome partially to its ability to embrace a range of ethnic and national identities, often assimilating many elements of the foreign cultures into its own traditions, beliefs or practices. The well-known Pax Romana , a period of prosperity and tranquility for approximately 200 years came at a point when Roman conquests came to a relative end, and a range of cultures were given the opportunity to live in harmony under one central government. While as all Empires, Rome did push some values and requirements upon the regions it conquered, for the most part, the people could live their lives, worship their respective religions, follow their respective traditions, and even maintain their own laws and taxation (Brooks, 2019). Rome by far was one of the most multicultural states in the ancient world that greatly respected the civilizations of others. The primary culture that strongly influenced the Roman culture is likely Ancient Greece. The Hellenistic society led the basis to much what is Roman, ranging from architecture to art to philosophy and politics. The Romans greatly respected the Greeks for their progress and intelligence, and sought to build upon that foundation in the prosperity of their empire including in the aspects of science, literature, law, economics, and even military tactics. Furthermore, the Romans were influenced by the Etruscans, a neighboring tribe to the northwest of Rome, who were allied with and then conquering the newly formed city-state. Etruscans were heavy traders with the Greeks, and had a similarly loose empire of city states, sharing many of the cultural elements. Essentially, the Etruscans allowed for the Greek culture to transition into Rome (Brooks, 2019). However, Rome was influenced by the Etruscans in its early days by contributing to its military capabilities and war-oriented, expansionist society.",
    "From ancient ages, humans have used symbols and myths to express their experience of a reality that transcends the physical world and transmits it to future generations. Nowadays, famous brands apply mythology to successful products due to their magical power. The logo of the house of Versace is a very extravagant and extraordinary mark; it was designed in 1978 by Gianni Versace. The logo represents the head of the ancient Greek mythology of Medusa Gorgon. The designer explained why he chose this character; it is a synthesis of beauty and simplicity, which is able to mesmerize anyone, just like the clothes produced by the brand. Other examples are Lamborghini; first, the Italian company was engaged in the production of tractors. The bull became the emblem of the brand, as the bull is the sacred animal of Zeus. According to some people, this animal is extremely hardy and strong, which endows the brand with great power. Now, Lamborghini cars are high-performance, expensive supercars, and the emblem of the golden bull is very appropriate for them. I prefer the myth of Prometheus because evil never prevails, and goodness and justice win. The mighty titan Prometheus stole the sacred fire from Olympus to provide it for humankind. He made humanity independent of the gods. Prometheus trained people to write, count, crafts and introduced them to metals. Before, people were afraid of the elements of the sea, but now the titan taught them how to build ships; humans became proficient in the art of medicine (Travis, 2021). Prometheus was destroying people’s faith in the deity, and for this, the thunderer Zeus decided to punish him. Prometheus was chained to a rock, the sunburned him mercilessly, and the rain was pounding him. However, this was not the end of the titan’s torment; a giant eagle sat on Prometheus’s chest every day and tore his liver (Travis, 2021). Heracles, the strongest men, killed the eagle that tortured Prometheus, broke Prometheus’ chains, and the titan was free.",
    "McDonald’s filed a lawsuit in the United States against its former CEO, Steve Easterbrook, after it was revealed that he had several consensual sexual encounters with workers in the year before his leave and maintained them hidden. Easterbrook misled authorities and threw away proof of his wrongdoing; he prioritized his interests over McDonald’s. Shareholders have filed a lawsuit against the corporation for attempting to prevent misbehavior and prioritizing speed over accuracy in resolving the issue. Negligent recruitment and retention responsibility are widely used to describe an employer’s commitment not to recruit or keep a worker (Monteiro et al., 2019). The supervisor was aware of or should have been aware of the likelihood of engaging in behavior against other persons or otherwise subjecting workers or third parties to legal responsibility. Companies can be held accountable for their workers’ intentional misbehavior (dos Santos et al., 2017). This work is written to study the case of negligence at work since negligence is the most common type of tort. If a McDonald’s fails to vet a worker before hiring them thoroughly and they cause harm to others, the corporation may be held accountable for their conduct. A McDonald’s, for instance, should examine all prior work, certification qualifications, and current professional associations before hiring an executive chef (Rushchenko et al., 2020). If the chef commits frequent culinary errors that cause health concerns for diners, the popular fast food restaurant is likely to be held accountable since it failed to do a basic employment background check. This is one of the reasons why criminal history checks are required. If a person strikes colleagues and consumers and can demonstrate that a criminal history check revealed past violent conduct, the business may be held liable. Assume an employer knows an employee’s risky, unpredictable, or disrespectful behavior but does not fire the worker. In that instance, McDonald’s might be held accountable for ensuring the safety of others.",
    "When it comes to people I find most fascinating and interesting, Neil deGrasse Tyson is one of them. This man is a famous astrophysicist and planetary scientist who shares his opinions and knowledge on various platforms. Personally, I find the pieces of information he provides mind-opening and shocking at times. I believe that this person knows a lot of controversial information and has various opinions on such matters, which would be pretty interesting to know. Neil deGrasse Tyson was born in 1958 and received several degrees from various universities, including Harvard, the University of Texas at Austin, and Columbia University (Tyson). Additionally, in early 2000, he was appointed by the president to serve on the Commission on the Future of the United States Aerospace Industry (Culp). I am a person who has always been fond of the vast and mysterious cosmos. I have watched a lot of documentaries that shed light on the peculiarities of universes, galaxies, and planets. Among those documentaries was Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey, narrated by Neil deGrasse Tyson. I believe that the knowledge of this astrophysicist stretches far beyond the information narrated in the documentary. If I had a chance to talk to this person, I would definitely ask him questions about extraterrestrial life. I have always found it perplexing that our planet is the only planet that has life, and I wonder if Tyson has any theories on this matter. I would also like to ask him whether he knows about any classified information at NASA. Hence, Neil deGrasse Tyson is one of the fascinating people to me. His knowledge and experience inspire me, and I would love to have a chance to talk to him in real life. From this experience, I would like to gain new perceptions and theories on the cosmos and information about outer space, something not commonly discussed. I think this person has more information and opinions to share.",
    "It is important to note that brain tissue is among the most complex and intricate structures of the human body, which has a highly limited capacity for healing and regeneration. The topic of the proposed research is to assess how neural stem cells replace and differentiate into neurons and other cells of the brain in order to use them for therapeutic purposes. N eural stems cells must be used as a therapeutic measure to slow or halt the aging process due to their rejuvenation and differentiation capabilities. Organization Plan  1. Introduction.  2. Literature Review.  3. Brain Aging.  4. Neural Stem Cell Differentiation.  5. Differentiation Regulation.  6. Therapeutic Approaches.  7. Discussion.  8. Conclusion. Literature Review Part 1 The preliminary research suggests that there is a complex system of regulatory steps that involve GABA signaling. There is an array of signaling molecules involved in the ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ) neurogenesis, such as Sonic hedgehog, fibroblast growth factor 2, glutamate, and others. The subgranular zone (SGZ) is another important germinal region of the adult human brain, and the mechanisms of regulations are comparatively different between V-SVZ and SGZ. Part 2 For example, a key source of the proposal states that “V-SVZ NSCs are regulated by local signals from their immediate neighbors, as well as by neurotransmitters and factors that are secreted by distant neurons, the choroid plexus, and vasculature” (Obernier & Alvarez-Buylla, 2019, p. 1). In other words, distantly located cells secrete a wide range of signaling molecules to regulate the neural stem cell generation, differentiation, and regeneration processes.

    "The two American regions to be first settled by the English colonists were New England and the Chesapeake Bay. In the Chesapeake Bay, the colonists arrived under the auspices of Virginia Company – a joint-stock enterprise dedicated to colonizing America for profit. Although the early hopes of finding precious metals did not materialize, the region eventually found its economic specialization in growing tobacco (Corbett et al., 2022). The company hired the English poor for the labor-intensive task of growing the colony and producing tobacco, and most of the newcomers were young single males (Corbett et al., 2022). Conversely, the New England colonies followed a different settlement pattern. Unlike the Chesapeake Bay, they were shaped not by the pursuit of profit but by the desire to escape persecution and perceived moral decadence of England and create a virtuous society (Corbett et al., 2022). New Englanders came to America as entire families and, unlike the Chesapeake Bay colonists, established a largely self-sustaining economy of farms, hamlets, and commercial enterprises rather than cash crop plantations (Corbett et al., 2022). Such were the differences in settlement patterns and shaping forces between the two. Religion played a considerable role in both regions, although in the shape of different denominations. The founders of New England colonies established their settlements with an explicitly religious purpose of creating a perfect Protestant community, which was the case in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and other colonies as well (Corbett et al., 2022). Interestingly enough, although the Chesapeake Bay colonies were business enterprises intended primarily for profit, the Anglican Church also played a considerable role in their life. For them, proselytism was a means to establish better relations with the Native Americans, as in John Rolf’s famous marriage to Pocahontas (Tsukada, 2020). Thus, both Protestant and Anglican denominations played their role in the colonization of New England and the Chesapeake Bay, respectively.",
    "A new creation that has recently entered the market is the electric scooter. It quickly gained popularity because it allowed people to rush from one part of the city to another. At the same time, people spent less time because they were not stuck in traffic lights (Hagiu and Wright 1527). Its competitive advantage, though, is that it does not harm the natural environment and requires less energy for maintenance. That is, such scooters use little energy resources to operate and therefore are better than a car (Hagiu and Wright 1527). It should be noted that some electric scooters can be charged by the sun accordingly; it can be described as an uncomplicated device for a low price, which enables to move quickly. Thus, the above advantages contribute to the fact that people are increasingly choosing electric scooters; consequently, they have gained popularity in the market in a short time. A product that will expand gradually in the market is wireless headphones. It is becoming popular because every phone manufacturer is trying to produce such an accessory. At the same time, the competitive advantage is that they are small and comfortable to use (Hagiu and Wright 1527). Although their price is higher than ordinary headphones, they work longer and do not break as quickly. They have gained a stronger position in the market because of the fact that they directly attach to phones at a distance, which is convenient in today’s world. Moreover, people who buy the phone also choose headphones from their company (Hagiu and Wright 1527). Thus, the benefits listed above contribute to the number of types of wireless headphones on the market and their popularity.",
    "With the current broad variety of species, as well as the emergent news about the species that are on the verge of extinction due to the impact of the changes in the environment, one might believe that discovering new animals is no longer a possibility. However, new species are still discovered regularly, the recent incredible find being an example of that. Namely, the Nimba myotis, also known as the fuzzy orange bat, or Myotis nimbaensis, has been identified as a new species this year (Simmons et al., 2021). Having orange fur with black pigmentation, Nimba Myotis represents a rather unusual specimen of bats. The animal prefers natural caves as the place where it lives and rests. Like other bats, Nimba Myotis uses laryngeal echolocation as the means of identifying and catching prey in the dark. However, due to the species in question being under researched, its diet is mostly unknown (Simmons et al., 2021). Overall, the bat represents a unique specimen in its class. The species belongs to the animal kingdom, particularly, to mammals of the Chiroptera order and the Vespertilionidae family (Simmons et al., 2021). The main rationale for placing it in the animal kingdom is the fact that Nimba Myotis is a mammal. Additionally, the specified species reproduces sexually, unlike members of other kingdoms, and is multicellular (Simmons et al., 2021). Furthermore, the fact that cells in Nimba Myotis do not have cell walls, allows classifying it with other species in the Animal kingdom. Therefore, the bat should be defined as an animal, particularly, a mammal. Furthermore, one should note that, being a bat, Nimba Myotis represents the largest order in the mammal class after rodents (Simmons et al., 2021). Overall, the discovery of Nimba Myotis has shed a lot of light on the species of bats, in general.",
    "There are many different species of marine microbes that exist in the water in massive amounts. Among the Nitrite oxidizing bacteria, there are six main types: Nitrotoga, Nitrospira, Nitrolancetus, Nitrospina, Nitrobacter, and Nitrococcus (Han 2). One of the fascinating species of bacteria is Nitrobacter which plays a crucial role in the nutrition of plants. Since this is a nitrifying bacterium, it serves as a simple way to release nitrogen that comes out of plants. Therefore, this paper aims to analyze the essence of the Nitrobacter, its specific characteristics its position in the ecosystem. Nitrobacter is the most interesting among the other species because it participates in converting nitrite to nitrates. Nitrification happens due to the receiving of nitrates from ammonia by oxidation, and the process goes with the help of the pair of bacteria, which are Nitrobacter and Nitrosomonas (Han 3). First of all, it is crucial to mention the concept of nitrification and the operations that are included there in order. Since the process is happening in the soil, it is a remarkable biological phenomenon that may also influence the other factors connected with nature. The nitrogen cycle is a significant part of the biological processes, and bacteria that exist in the soil take part in the majority of chemical phases that produce atmospheric nitrogen into the new condition. Overall, Nitrobacter is an integral part of maintaining the diversity of the microorganism in the soil that is provided by its oxidation activity. It plays a critical role in the plants’ nutrition and, as a nitrifying bacterium, makes it possible for the soil to preserve the auspicious condition and maintain its fertility. Thus, due to those reasons, Nitrobacter is an exceptionally fascinating species of Nitrite oxidizing bacteria.",
    "Millions of people worldwide suffer from mental disorders: manias, phobias, and panic attacks exhaust and torment a lot of individuals. One of the widespread, long-lasting mental ailments is an obsessive-compulsive disorder or OCD, which consists of obsessive thoughts and compulsive behavior that are almost impossible to control. The analysis of this disorder due to the four D diagnostic indicators can let us explore it more profoundly and thoroughly.   * Distress: OCD often makes individuals feel abnormal when they are forced to fight the terrible thoughts torturing their heads and repeat meaningless acts intended to decrease anxiety. In addition, having “unwanted, recurrent and persistent images or impulses that evoke anxiety or extreme distress” and realizing “the unreasonable nature of symptoms” people cannot stop them (Van Leeuwen et al., 2020, p. 1-2). They become nervous and depressed: therefore, the level of distress is high and complicates the person’s life.   * Dysfunction: This disorder significantly influences the daily life of a patient. Firstly, obsessive thoughts often interfere with the usual people’s acts and cause a surge of panic, disturbing to complete their work. Sometimes, “cognitive biases cause dysfunctional beliefs” (Van Leeuwen et al., 2020, p. 2). Secondly, compulsive actions interrupt a patient’s daily routine, forcing them to do specific steps a certain number of times. Such activities can last even for an hour or more: therefore, the extent of dysfunction is also noticeable.   * Danger: OCD may represent a significant danger for an individual since sometimes, people feel so depressed that they are ready to commit suicide. In addition, sometimes, they may try to defeat their obsessive thoughts, causing self-pain: for instance, they can strike themselves to get rid of the unwanted image. However, although one of the most widespread fears of people with OCD is to harm others, they rarely do it (O’Connor & Aude, 2019). Thus, the level of danger to self is significantly higher than that of danger to others.   * Deviance: Since OCD causes abnormal thoughts and behavior, people with such a disorder can be characterized as deviant. However, it would be wrong to claim that it is easy to “determine the degree of deviation from the norm” (Davis, 2009, p. 1). OCD causes anxiety, stress, and panic; it makes people live in fear that if they do not do specific actions, they will not be able to avoid danger. Therefore, an individual should visit a clinic and let specialists help them fight.",

    "In the survey The Effect Of Work Relationships On Organizational Culture And Commitment, as many as 89% of respondents confirmed that communication with colleagues affects the quality of life (Suhardi, 2020). It also turned out that if a person has at least one friend at work, it connects him more strongly with the company and supports his desire to stay in this place. Feeling connected to other people supports employees’ interest and involvement in work. Talking to colleagues, a person gradually gets rid of the fear of expressing their ideas and comments. Scientists from the University of Michigan conducted an interesting experiment, Friends (and Sometimes Enemies) With Cognitive Benefits: What Types of Social Interactions Boost Executive Functioning? The participants were divided into two groups: first, the first group subjects had to get to know each other for 10 minutes. And the second group was asked to participate in disputes among themselves on a certain topic. Then all the subjects were asked to solve several cognitive tasks. The experiment participants from the first group, who had previously just communicated in a relaxed atmosphere, showed the best results in solving problems. They had significant improvements in the executive functions of the brain. These processes are responsible for planning, concentration, prioritization, and organization. In other words, for the skills and qualities that we need to work.",
    "Osteoarthritis is a disease that affects people all over the world, but is frequently mishandled within the healthcare system. It is one of the most common causes of disability in older persons, resulting in pain, loss of function, and a lower quality of life. On a societal level, the condition is predicted to cost $303 billion in medical bills and lost wages each year (Abramoff & Caldera, 2020). This chronic, severe disease requires continued efforts to limit its incidence, pain, and loss of function. Osteoarthritis is known for its degenerative effects on articular cartilage, which becomes significantly damaged over time. The smooth cartilage at the ends of long bones and within the intervertebral discs is known as articular cartilage. It provides a low-friction articulation surface while being able to transmit large loads. Even while the collagen in cartilage has a lengthy half-life, it repairs slowly, if at all, even with slight injuries. Although the cartilage transforms the most, the entire joint, including the synovium, joint ligaments, and subchondral bone, is impacted. Osteoarthritis is often overlooked, despite its significant personal, economic, and societal costs. Even though osteoarthritis frequently coexists with heart disease, diabetes, and mental health issues, and can aggravate the morbidity and mortality associated with these ailments, it is not included in worldwide strategic plans for noncommunicable diseases. Patients and practitioners may be affected by therapeutic nihilism, with misconceptions that osteoarthritis is an unavoidable component of aging and that there are no viable therapies (Abramoff & Caldera, 2020). The affected people are frequently misinformed about treatment options. Current health-care approaches can range from ignoring essential treatments like exercise, weight loss, and education to using expensive, unproven medications for late-stage disease. I find this issue to be the most interesting, although unfortunate, element of both the article and the condition’s perception. I believe that rehabilitation counselling could combine physical and psychological aid to help patients with osteoarthritis and its various consequences.",
    "Outreach Chicago is an organization providing help and services to homeless people and those underserved by already existing incorporations. The company’s main mission is to provide help and necessities to humans for their subsequent successful reintegration into society. To practice deductive reasoning, it is essential to start by formulating a general hypothesis or statement that Outreach Chicago provides help to people (Adler & Clark, 2015). The observation allows us to find evidence for the statement as Outreach Chicago serves meals and distributes hygiene kits, coats, blankets, socks, and undergarments to people in need. The company’s official site provides precise numbers of each aid type, so one can conclude that the company indeed provides help with various necessities since 2011 to people in need. Outreach Chicago states the average poverty rate in its area of performance is 34% among adults and 51% among children (Outreach Chicago, 2022). To practice inductive reasoning, it might be useful to compare data stated by the company with the other statistical sources regarding poverty rates, checking the modernity of the information it proposes to the readers. The company works in several locations: Chicago Heights, Chicago, Cicero, Dolton, and Harvey (Outreach Chicago, 2022). The estimations, according to the site Welfare Info, relate to the following poverty rates among adults in 2017 26.4%, 20.6%, 19.8%, 26.6%, and 35.6% respectively (Poverty Illinois, 2022). The calculated average of these areas is 25.8% which means the company was either gathering data from previous years or referring to the numbers of the poorest city, Harvey. A question for qualitative research can be if the services provided by Outreach Chicago meet the requirements of the customers. This research can interview customers and assess the impression of service, and the use of the goods it supplies. The study hypothesizes that Outreach Chicago provides essential supplies for its clients. The results of the research could be used for better service providing as customers can give feedback on some items that are not necessary or could be changed. For the quantitative study, the question is if the general satisfaction level of the clients is above 50%. To estimate satisfaction, the clients will be given application forms to fill in. The research hypothesizes that Outreach Chicago meets the expectations of the customers by more than 50%. The research can help the organization receive information about the effectiveness of its performance.",
    "Overpopulation in cities has become one of the most critical problems of our time. This is both an environmental and a social problem. The city cannot grow indefinitely and provide decent workplaces for every resident. The ecological burden is also increasing. Uncontrolled growth in the number of cities leads to the unchecked spread of pollution and the escalation of poverty. However, there are several preventive measures that the Government can implement to combat this problem. First of all, overpopulation in cities is congestion and traffic jams, which lead to serious pollution problems. Atmospheric pollution is the most serious in cities, and its primary source is road transport, which emits sulfur dioxide and nitrogen into the air in huge quantities. The second main problem is poverty: disadvantaged groups in rural areas live in poverty (Innes et al., 2019). Some of them decide to settle in the city because they believe that they can easily find work. Their main goal is to provide for their family, but almost none have the necessary education for a good job. These people come to the city and become a service class. They suffer from the prejudice of indigenous people, poverty, and worse working conditions. Another inconvenience due to overcrowding is the garbage from residents, which is difficult to dispose of (Namberger et al., 2019). In many European countries, this problem is solved thanks to separate garbage collection (even in houses, there are separate garbage cans). Then some of the garbage is recycled, some are incinerated at incinerators. In conclusion, to solve traffic and air pollution problems, people should use public transport as often as possible, rather than using their car. The government should build more roads and improve public transport to solve this problem. Poverty is now lower than at any time in human history, and all trends demonstrate that we will have consistent successes in the fight against poverty in the foreseeable future.",
    "The Balboa is Panama’s national currency, named after Spanish explorer Vasco Nez de Balboa, who encountered the Pacific Ocean. One Balboa represents one U.S. Dollar, and the U.S. Dollar has been lawfully exchanged in Panama since then. As a result, Panama is regarded a highly inflationary country; however, Panama can profit from the U.S. dollar’s resilience as the foundation of the world banking markets. For example, this implies that Panama will not face hyperinflation as a consequence of shifting exchange rates. Consequently, Panama has become a more attractive investment and tourist destination. Nevertheless, a dollarized system has outstanding inflation performances and may even lessen the influence of global trust shocks but not real external upsets (Bakari & Mabrouki, 2017). Furthermore, it is unclear whether Panama’s loose monetary policy resulted from the dollarization system or the competing, increasingly globalized banking sector. Panama’s geographic position as a key maritime route adds to the significance of the Agreement. Approximately two-thirds of the Panama Canal’s yearly transits are destined to or from U.S. locations (Park et al., 2020). Almost all U.S. automotive and commercial goods shipments to Panama will be duty-free initially, with residual levies phased away over a ten-year period (Park et al., 2020). Information systems gear, farming, large machinery, aircraft and components, healthcare and measure environmental, ecological products, medicines, fertilizer, and agrochemicals are among the U.S. items that will benefit from immediate duty-free accessibility. The U.S. and Panama exchange crops like corn and bananas if we talk about exports and imports."

The board of directors, which appoints these officers, maintains a balance of power, allowing for the removal of CEOs and CFOs if necessary. Shareholders have the flexibility to transfer ownership, enabling the corporation to be sold in critical situations like bankruptcy. This is in contrast to limited liability companies (LLCs), where investors cannot profit through ownership transfer. Additionally, corporations like CSC are subject to double taxation, with income taxed at both the corporate and shareholder levels.\n\nIn summary, Charles Schwab Corporation operates as a corporation with multiple subsidiaries, adhering to the requirements of this business form. The board of directors plays a crucial role in overseeing the company, with the power to appoint new officers in critical situations. Furthermore, corporations like CSC can transfer property rights in cases of bankruptcy or other crises.",
    "The role of a clinical or medical office worker is defined by a blend of numerous administrative tasks with healthcare responsibilities. Chiefly, these professionals serve as office coordinators, completing documentation and collaborating with staff (“How to become a medical office assistant,” 2021). Consequently, I will approach interviews for this position with a professional business demeanor. Although a fitting suit can be costly, I already possess the necessary formal attire. By donning my black formal suit, shoes, and minimal accessories, I can create a positive impression without straining my budget. In warm weather, I can attend an interview directly in a suit, and in cold weather, I can add my usual outerwear, such as a coat. Work attire, theoretically, may require additional investments and purchases. All healthcare professionals, including office workers, must wear a specialized uniform called scrubs, consisting of a short-sleeved shirt and trousers. This uniform is relatively affordable, and a single set of scrubs can be found on Amazon for approximately $20-$40 (“Medical assistant’s uniform,” 2019). Most importantly, in this context, one needs to prioritize footwear since these specialists sometimes have to stand or walk extensively. A good pair of closed-toe shoes can cost around $100, but I have tennis shoes that meet the dress code (“Medical assistant’s uniform,” 2019). However, it must be considered that many medical institutions provide uniforms on their own, regarding them as consumables, so the decision to purchase a uniform will depend on the rules of a particular hospital. In any case, it is simple and easy to wear, so it will not entail high expenses. Reflecting on the points studied and prepared, I want to note that the new information will affect my budget and life plan very little. In the best-case scenario, if the hospital provides uniforms, I won’t have to spend any money at all, as I can wear my existing suit for the interview and shoes for work. In the worst-case scenario, I will still be within the budget when I have to buy everything for work. Therefore, I can set that $200 aside and mentally prepare for possible demands from my interviewers. Additionally, this study showed that the issue of clothing for interviews and work is not a problem for me, and I am already prepared for it in many respects.",
    "At the heart of every child's emotional universe lies the mother complex, a primal force that Carl Jung identified as an innate feeling of care and nurturing. But what happens when this essential bond is broken? A dark archetype emerges, driving the child to seek comfort and security elsewhere. This is precisely what unfolds in the gripping film Every Secret Thing, where a toxic mother-daughter relationship takes center stage.\n\nAlice's mother, Helen, is a master manipulator who fosters a sense of insecurity in her daughter, making her feel like she's constantly walking on eggshells. Helen's favoritism towards Ronnie, a young girl from a different racial background, only adds fuel to the fire, creating a tangled web of emotions that ultimately leads to Alice's false imprisonment. But that's not all - Helen's deceit and betrayal know no bounds, as she plants evidence to frame Alice for a crime she didn't commit.\n\nMeanwhile, the contrast between Alice's dysfunctional relationship with her mother and Ronnie's indifferent relationship with her parents couldn't be more stark. As the truth begins to unravel, the audience is left reeling with the realization that not only were Alice and Ronnie wrongly accused, but the justice system failed to bring the real culprit - Helen - to justice. The mother complex has never been more sinister.",
    "A recent incident at a Chicago hot dog restaurant has sparked a heated debate about ethics. The controversy began when a customer was politely asked to don a mask in order to receive service, as mandated by the state (Sutton, 2022). However, the individual responded with shocking aggression, hurling snow at the employee's face multiple times (Sutton, 2022). The situation escalated further when the offender vandalized the restaurant's property by shattering the glass door with an unknown object (Sutton, 2022). This disturbing incident raises serious ethical concerns due to the disproportionate and violent reaction of the customer. While throwing snow may not be illegal, it is undoubtedly a blatant display of disrespect towards the employee. \n\nFrom a utilitarian perspective, this incident is morally reprehensible because it resulted in harmful consequences. The offender's actions led to property damage and caused harm to an innocent employee. Therefore, according to utilitarianism, the actions can be deemed wrong due to their negative impact. \n\nIn contrast, the Kantian moral theory views the incident as irrational because it violates moral law and duty. The offender's decision to harm an innocent person and damage property is immoral and goes against the principles of rational behavior. \n\nIn my opinion, utilitarianism provides the most logical framework for evaluating this ethical dilemma. The reason is that negative consequences for anyone involved can serve as a reliable moral compass for decision-making. The Kantian moral theory, on the other hand, relies on moral law, which can be subjective and open to interpretation. As a result, some individuals may not consider the incident an ethical issue from a Kantian perspective. In contrast, utilitarianism provides a clear and objective standard: any action that causes harm to others is morally wrong.",
    "The primary source of data for this study is the esteemed medical journal, The Lancet, which publishes survey data, statistical analysis, and comparative assessments of the quantitative information obtained. The Economist serves as a secondary source, providing a summary of the research with a focus on the non-digital aspects. The study reveals a decline in the HIV infection rate among schoolgirls, attributed to the stabilization of their families' financial difficulties. The World Bank sponsored this research to demonstrate the efficacy of financial investment in reducing the spread of HIV among impoverished young girls. The study, authored by Berk Özler, Lead Economist and Poverty Research Manager, presents statistics based on a survey conducted in the Zomba district of Malawi. The Lancet published the findings, which were subsequently summarized by The Economist. The study involved a sample size of 1,300 unmarried girls aged 13-22, deemed sufficient to represent the prevalence of HIV in impoverished areas. The participants were randomly assigned to different experimental groups using a computer-generated process. The groups consisted of girls and their families receiving monthly financial assistance, girls receiving payment for attending school, and a control group without financial support. The study's results indicate that the subjects who received financial assistance in both groups exhibited a significant reduction in the spread of the virus. Conversely, the control group without financial support showed no decline in HIV infection rates, as the participants were more likely to seek financial support from older men. The implication of this study is that financial investment is a crucial factor in reducing the spread of HIV. However, further research and assistance to young girls are hindered by several limitations. Firstly, it is challenging to determine the optimal amount of financial support required to deter individuals from seeking alternative means of financial assistance. Additionally, the 18-month duration of the study precludes long-term assessments of its effectiveness.",
    "Horror movies have become a popular type of film. One reason for their popularity is that they create a strong emotional response in the people who watch them. For some people, horror movies are a way to deal with their problems and emotions. They can be a way to distract ourselves from our troubles and feel a rush of adrenaline. Horror movies also allow us to experience fear in a safe environment, which can be a way to reset our emotions and feel normal again. While it may seem strange to pay to feel scared, horror movies are a way for people to experience strong emotions in a controlled way. The success of horror movies depends on how well they can make the audience feel something. This is what makes horror movies stand out as a type of art. In the end, horror movies are not a form of cruel entertainment, but rather a way for people to experience strong emotions and deal with their problems.",
    "A mutation is a fundamental alteration in an organism's genome, often resulting from disruptions to the sequence of genes or the emergence of new ones. This paper focuses on spontaneous mutations, which occur randomly and naturally, without any external influence. A fascinating example of such a mutation is found in the ADRB1 gene, responsible for regulating sleep patterns. While most people require eight hours of sleep or more per night, approximately 5% of the population possesses a mutant version of this gene, allowing them to thrive on just 4-6 hours of sleep per night. Research on a mother-daughter duo with this mutation revealed that they encoded a receptor for norepinephrine, a dominant, autosomal, and beneficial trait that enhances their viability.\n\nNotably, changes in the ADRB1 gene are primarily observed in humans, although they may also occur in animals, pending further investigation. Importantly, this mutation does not pose a threat to the general population, as it is not life-threatening and does not compromise the health of its carriers. Instead, it offers a unique advantage, expanding the possibilities for human capabilities.\n\nThe significance of this example lies in its demonstration of the potential for natural changes in the human genome to open up new avenues for human development. Therefore, studying such spontaneous mutations is crucial for gaining a deeper understanding of human capabilities and promoting further advancements in the field.",
    "In his powerful graphic novel, Maus, Art Spiegelman employs anthropomorphism to convey the stark differences between Americans, Germans, and Jews during World War II. This innovative device simplifies the complex issue, making it more relatable and engaging for readers. Through Maus, Spiegelman sheds light on the Holocaust's atrocities while humanizing its victims and survivors, reminding us that they had lives, dreams, and hopes beyond the war.\n\nIn Chapter 1, \"The Sheik,\" Artie's father Vladek recounts his carefree life in 1935, revealing that even in the face of horror, people cling to happy memories. In Chapter 3, \"Prisoner of War,\" Vladek's recollections of his time as a soldier are marked by vivid details, such as the name of a soldier he killed, highlighting the human brain's tendency to focus on the mundane amidst chaos. The chapter culminates with Vladek's reunion with his family, a moment that overshadows his experiences as a prisoner of war.\n\nIn Chapter 5, \"Mouse Holes,\" Spiegelman illustrates the desperate decisions people made to survive during wartime. Even in the face of devastating loss, individuals had to remain detached to avoid capture. Through Maus, Spiegelman masterfully conveys the irony of the Holocaust: the Germans, portrayed as animals, believed themselves superior to others. This graphic novel is a unique and poignant exploration of World War II, highlighting the human experiences that fueled hope and resilience amidst unimaginable horror.",

    "Unlocking the Secrets of Profitability: A Deep Dive into ABC Company's Financial Performance\n\nIn the world of commerce, three ratios reign supreme: Return on Assets (RoA), Return on Equity (RoE), and Profit Margin. These metrics hold the key to understanding a company's ability to generate profits and create value for its stakeholders. In this analysis, we'll delve into the world of ABC Company, exploring how these ratios can make or break a business.\n\nThe RoA ratio reveals how efficiently a company utilizes its assets to drive financial returns. The RoE ratio, on the other hand, focuses on the returns generated by shareholder equity, excluding debt. Meanwhile, the Profit Margin ratio provides a snapshot of a company's financial health by comparing sales to profits. By examining these ratios, we can gain valuable insights into ABC Company's profitability and growth potential.\n\nA Closer Look at ABC Company's Financial Performance\n\nABC Company's business model is a resounding success, with impressive profits and optimal returns on equity and assets. This suggests that investors can expect a healthy return on their investment. The company's profit margin is also noteworthy, indicating that its operations are well-managed. With a profit margin exceeding 50%, ABC Company has established itself as a profitable enterprise that successfully converts its assets into revenue.\n\nHowever, as we dig deeper, it becomes clear that ABC Company's financial success is not without its limitations. While the company's profit margin is impressive, its overall turnover is below $1 million, which may not be sufficient to drive sustained growth in the long term.\n\nBenchmarking Against the Industry's Best\n\nTo gain a more comprehensive understanding of ABC Company's performance, we must compare it to the industry's leaders. According to Rose (2022), the industry's average return on assets ranges from 9.1% to 9.3%. ABC Company's current ratio of 28.3% is significantly higher, but its absolute cash flows are not on par with the industry's leaders. This disparity becomes even more apparent when we compare income levels. The industry's average net income is $4.7 million, while ABC Company's net income is a mere $77,000. Furthermore, industry leaders like Williams-Sonoma boast hundreds of millions of dollars in sales, whereas ABC Company's sales are a fraction of that.\n\nAs ABC Company continues to grow, it's essential to maintain its profitability above the industry average. This will require a laser-like focus on optimizing operations, managing assets, and driving revenue growth. By doing so, ABC Company can ensure its long-term success and remain a competitive force in the industry.",
    "Illustrating the existences of deities and showcasing connections between them, as well as their engagements with mortals, both \"Iliad\" and \"Metamorphosis\" delve into the motif of authority exploitation by those in control. In \"Iliad,\" Agamemnon faces consequences due to his persistent misuse of authority: \"be prepared, lest I be left,/Alone of all the Greeks, without my reward\" (Homer, 762 B.C.). Similarly, in \"Metamorphosis,\" various divinities display utter disdain for those with lesser influence: \"What had escaped the tides, now feared the blaze\" (Ovid, 8 B.C.). However, unlike \"Iliad,\" \"Metamorphosis\" rarely demonstrates the repercussions that deities face for their disregard of mortals' necessities (Homer, 762 B.C.; Ovid, 8 B.C.). Therefore, while thematically similar, \"Iliad\" and \"Metamorphosis\" represent slightly different outlooks on the issue of authority exploitation. The motif of mortals' safeguarding, which is central to both \"Iliad\" and \"Metamorphosis,\" remains crucial nowadays as well. Specifically, a range of contemporary leaders appear to wield immense power due to their political sway, their economic clout, or a combination of both (Homer, 762 B.C.; Ovid, 8 B.C.). For instance, the disregard for human rights in countries such as China, where leaders attain the status of god-like entities, can be seen as similar to the one in \"Iliad\" and \"Metamorphosis.\" However, what makes \"Metamorphosis\" slightly less effective in this regard is the humorous manner in which it portrays the exploitation of mortals. In turn, \"Iliad,\" being a more solemn work, produces a much greater impact by condemning the brutality of all-powerful gods toward humans, which is more in line with the current concept of authority exploitation. Nevertheless, both \"Iliad\" and \"Metamorphosis\" carry an important message and a profound significance. Providing an insight into authority dynamics within Ancient Greek society, they also help recognize similar patterns in the modern community.",
    "A recent study by Zulaika (2022) investigates the consequences of COVID-19 lockdowns on teenage pregnancy and school dropout rates among Kenyan secondary school girls. Following the nationwide school closure from March 2020 to January 2021, Kenya witnessed a surge in teenage pregnancies. The research focuses on Rarieda subcounty, examining the pandemic's impact on adolescents' sexual and reproductive health. The findings reveal a lack of involvement from health administrators in addressing pregnancy among school girls, who often lack sexual education and awareness of protection methods. This can lead to serious health risks and long-term socio-economic problems. Moreover, the high stress levels of pregnant teenagers can affect their mental and physical well-being. To address this issue, the study recommends implementing emergency measures targeting school girls, providing them with basic sexual education and information on the consequences of sexual activity. Additionally, the article highlights the need for a national project to educate students and their parents about sexual and reproductive health, as the lack of knowledge can lead to the rapid spread of infectious diseases. Overall, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on teenage pregnancy, resulting in additional social and economic problems for individuals, families, and the country as a whole.",
    "For the assignment, I chose France as the country. If you need to transport a loved one's remains to France, you'll need to contact the Consulate General of France in Los Angeles, California. To do this, you'll need to schedule a meeting with a specialist at the consulate two days in advance to discuss the details.\n\nTo prepare, you'll need to gather several documents, including:\n\n* A death certificate from the US\n* A medical report\n* A certificate of cremation and sealing\n* An attestation that the urn is sealed and free of extraneous attachments\n* A certificate stating the deceased did not have infectious diseases\n* A permit to import remains\n* The person's permission to request repatriation\n* A certified French translation of the death and cremation certificates\n\nYou'll also need an urn with the ashes in a special airtight container. To transport the urn, you can contact the French consulate in the US and prepare the necessary documents. Several airlines, such as Air France-KLM, offer transportation services for ashes.

    "Amazon: The E-commerce Giant with a Human Cost\n\nAs the largest online retailer in the US, Amazon has revolutionized the way we shop, with millions relying on its lightning-fast deliveries and unbeatable prices. But behind the scenes, a different story unfolds. With a workforce of hundreds of thousands, Amazon has become one of the country's largest employers, with fulfillment centers sprawling across the nation. However, this massive scale has given rise to a plethora of problems, and the company's treatment of its workers has recently come under intense public scrutiny.\n\nAt the heart of the issue lies a toxic cycle of job dissatisfaction and high turnover rates. While a $15 hourly wage may seem attractive to those in disadvantaged neighborhoods, it's a short-term fix that fails to address the underlying issues. In reality, Amazon's motivation techniques are stuck in the dark ages, relying on fear and discouraging teamwork. It's time for a radical overhaul.\n\nThe root of the problem lies in Amazon's outdated approach to motivation. By failing to incentivize its workers with meaningful pay raises and bonuses, the company is hemorrhaging talent and damaging its reputation. The solution is clear: adopt a more conservative motivation framework that prioritizes respect, trust, and employee well-being.\n\nIt's time for Amazon to rethink its strategy and prioritize its people. By introducing systematic pay raises, enhancing bonus systems, and revamping its timing policies, the company can create a more positive and respectful work environment. The benefits are clear: reduced turnover rates, increased productivity, and a restored public image. The question is, will Amazon take the necessary steps to become a true leader in employee satisfaction?",
    "American slavery emerged as a means of exploiting labor within the capitalist system, eventually developing into a distinct socio-economic and political structure. Over time, a liberation movement gained momentum, highlighting the illegality and immorality of \"owning\" people. Although slavery was officially abolished after the Civil War, the newly freed individuals faced significant challenges. Lacking essential resources, including documentation, financial support, and moral guidance, they struggled to integrate into mainstream society. Moreover, discrimination and exclusion persisted, hindering their ability to access equal opportunities.\n\nThe Thirteenth Amendment to the US Constitution, ratified in January 1865, formally ended slavery in the United States, rendering it illegal and unconstitutional. Today, this dark chapter in American history is widely regarded as one of the most shameful episodes in the country's past. However, a pressing question remains: should the state have provided compensation to former slaves for the material and emotional harm they suffered? Even without official slavery, the absence of basic resources and support made survival uncertain. Societal attitudes and biases also influenced the acceptance of newly freed individuals, who faced unequal access to benefits and opportunities. As a result, they were not truly emancipated, remaining dependent on external sources for subsistence.",

    "The competitive landscape is complex and multifaceted, encompassing factors such as company size and number, strengths and weaknesses, market entry and exit barriers, and substitute threats. Unlike traditional competition, which relied on large advertising budgets and economies of scale, today's competitive environment is shaped by rapid technological advancements. To stay competitive, companies must adopt an innovative, integrated, flexible, and speedy mindset, leveraging data-driven decision-making, adapting to the latest technologies, and prioritizing customer experience. Most companies focus on customer-centric operations to meet demands, build brand awareness, and foster loyalty. Key drivers of the current competitive landscape include new business models, consumer protection, price transparency, hypercompetition, and environmental awareness, with flexibility and technology being the primary factors. Companies must be adaptable and utilize various strategies to outperform competitors. Those that can rapidly respond to changing conditions, such as NVIDIA, which successfully pivoted to remote computing and gaming during the COVID-19 pandemic, are more likely to thrive even in challenging economic times.",
    "Guaman Poma's life was a testament to the brutal injustices of the colonial government, which he suffered at the hands of the Spanish conquerors. As a direct descendant of Incan nobility, he witnessed his family's ancestral lands and titles being ripped away, and his own attempts to reclaim them were met with cold indifference by the colonial authorities. Initially, Poma collaborated with the colonizers, but after being exiled for allegedly falsifying his noble lineage, he underwent a radical transformation. He became a fierce critic of the Spanish regime, denouncing their cruel treatment of native Peruvians and exposing the dark underbelly of colonialism. In a monumental 1200-page manuscript, lavishly illustrated and addressed to the Spanish monarch, Poma chronicled the rich cultural heritage of the Andean people before the invasion and the atrocities they endured under the Conquistadors. His searing indictment of colonialism argued that the Spanish were usurpers who had no divine right to seize control of the land that rightfully belonged to the Peruvian people. Instead, Poma proposed a revolutionary system of governance that was truly representative of the people and tailored to their practical needs. His vision of a government created for and by the people who had historically inhabited the land was strikingly modern and far-reaching. By refuting the myth that Europeans brought civilization to the Incas, Poma's work laid bare the hypocrisy of colonialism, revealing it as a thinly veiled excuse for violence, exploitation, and cultural erasure. His manuscript is a powerful testament to the destruction of an entire way of life, as a people were stripped of their freedom and forced to assimilate into a foreign culture. While Poma admired the moral ideals the Spanish professed, he showed that their actions fell woefully short of their lofty rhetoric.",
    "**Unlocking the Power of Prayer**\n\nThe transformative impact of prayer is rooted in the intricacies of human cognition. By harnessing the dual forces of attention - switching and concentration - individuals can transcend to a realm of higher spirituality. The deliberate and systematic recitation of worship cultivates a profound mental connection with the divine, fortifying faith in the supernatural.\n\nAs Froese and Jones (2021) astutely observe, prayer is a potent catalyst for strengthening one's faith, rendering it a sacred session of devotion. Moreover, public prayer has long been wielded as a powerful tool to shape the political landscape. This phenomenon can be regarded as a mighty weapon, imbued with sacred and supernatural authority.\n\nMartin's article echoes this sentiment, highlighting the historical precedents of prayer being used to vanquish enemy forces through divine intervention. The legendary tale of a Roman legion discovering a spring of water through prayer, which subsequently led to the defeat of their enemies, serves as a testament to the transformative power of prayer (Martin, 2019).\n\nBoth authors concur that prayer serves as a potent weapon, bridging the gap between humanity and the divine. The ritual of prayer often yields a profound sense of social acceptance and emotional uplift, while the rhythmic repetition of prayers reinforces the ideals and guidelines of a particular religion (Froese & Jones, 2021). Martin further notes that these circumstances render prayer an effective epiphany strategy, allowing individuals to proactively shape their destiny.\n\nThroughout history, prayer has been employed as a beacon of hope in times of turmoil. Early Christians implored God for protection in battle, while prayers were used to bolster the resolve of the Israelites, long before the birth of Jesus (Martin, 2019). The initiators of such prayers reassured soldiers of their place in heaven, should they emerge victorious.\n\n**The Transformative Power of Repentance**\n\nIn his second letter to the Corinthians, Paul illuminates the concept of repentance as a profound sorrow for God's sake, leading to salvation (2 Corinthians 7:10). True repentance, in Paul's understanding, is a commitment to forsake sin, allowing the soul to be cleansed and receptive to the grace of the Holy Spirit. Through dedication and devotion, individuals can unlock the full potential of prayer, transcending the boundaries of human limitation.",
    "The debate between relativism and objectivism revolves around the nature of morality. Relativists argue that morality is not objective, and the moral norms adopted by society are not universally binding. In their view, concepts like good and evil are merely fictional. As researcher Porus notes, this perspective can lead to permissiveness and a devaluation of moral norms (Bush and Moss, 2020). Relativists may be seen as unwilling to compromise or negotiate, as they do not recognize a higher moral authority.\n\nIn contrast, objectivists believe that there is a universal right and wrong that transcends individual opinions and circumstances. They argue that moral standards are timeless and unchanging, not created by humans. While there are various philosophical interpretations of objectivism, the core idea is that there is one objective truth. This perspective fundamentally opposes relativism (Bush and Moss, 2020). However, objectivists acknowledge that some moral norms may evolve over time, but they are grounded in an unchanging understanding of good and evil.\n\nDespite its flaws, I find relativism more convincing. While absolute relativism can lead to a lack of moral direction, the theory acknowledges the complexity of real-life decision-making. In everyday life, we face choices that cannot be simply labeled right or wrong. Most people strive to act ethically, but their actions can still be perceived negatively due to individual experiences, psychological characteristics, and circumstances. I believe objectivism oversimplifies morality and threatens to distort our understanding of reality.",

    "Yoga is a multifaceted practice that integrates spiritual, mental, and physical disciplines to optimize cognitive and physiological functions. By practicing yoga, individuals can expand their perspectives, transform their lifestyles, and eliminate detrimental patterns that hinder personal growth. As a result, yoga is recognized as a highly effective self-development practice that offers unique benefits for both physical and psychological well-being.\n\nModern yoga encompasses various styles, all of which are rooted in three core components: physical postures, breathing exercises, and spiritual contemplation. The synergistic combination of these exercises trains both the body and mind, yielding distinct health benefits, including enhanced muscle strength, flexibility, and mental resilience.\n\nYoga has been shown to have significant therapeutic and preventive effects, particularly in patients with musculoskeletal conditions, where it has been proven to reduce pain and improve joint mobility (Saeed et al., 2019). Additionally, breathing exercises relax airway muscles, promoting better lung function and oxygen diffusion.\n\nThe \"eight limbs\" of yoga, a foundational concept, comprise a series of stages designed to achieve enlightenment. These eight steps facilitate a sense of connection to the world, enabling individuals to control their actions, accept challenges calmly, and find compromises. The ultimate goal of yoga is to strike a balance between personal and global values, recognizing each individual's essential role in the community.\n\nBy integrating body, mind, and soul, yoga significantly enhances social well-being, fostering a healthy and harmonious personality, activating energy potential, and preventing psychological stress. In conclusion, yoga is essential for promoting health, combating social isolation and depression, and can be applied to physical development, healing, and emotional restoration. Its holistic approach makes it an indispensable and beneficial self-development practice for adults and children alike.",
    "Theodor Adorno's concept of industrial culture highlights the strong link between capitalist society and the cultural products it generates, which in turn reinforce the social practices that fuel capitalism's growth. According to Adorno, most media products, such as films, books, and TV shows, perpetuate the population's belief in capitalist values. In contrast, structural functionalism views society as a cohesive system, where each component plays a vital role in maintaining social stability. While both theories prioritize social stability, their differences become apparent when applied to modern culture and society.\n\nAdorno's theory critiques the narrative of mass media products, which often equate wealth with happiness. A more striking example of this is children's entertainment, which exposes young minds to various forms of media, including TV shows, cartoons, and animated films. From a structural functionalist perspective, the children's entertainment industry serves as a tool for education and emotional development, teaching important moral values like kindness and politeness. However, Adorno's industrial culture approach argues that modern children's entertainment is primarily driven by the desire to sell merchandise featuring popular characters. For instance, Disney has developed a business model that leverages cartoon characters to attract children to their theme parks. The company strategically releases animated films and merchandise simultaneously to maximize profits.",
    "**Understanding People and Their Motivations**\n\nHave you ever wondered why certain people behave in certain ways or what drives them to make the choices they do? The concept of archetypes can help us understand these questions. Archetypes are universal patterns that define people, events, and objects, and they play a significant role in shaping our perception of the world.\n\nIn our daily lives, archetypes can help us identify different types of people, each with their unique set of characteristics. These characteristics are shaped by a person's actions, inclinations, and environment. For example, someone like Elon Musk, the CEO of a large corporation, can be seen as a hero or creator archetype. He is driven by a desire to change the world and inspire others, and his actions are motivated by these characteristics.\n\nBy recognizing archetypes in everyday life, we can gain a deeper understanding of people and their motivations. This can help us predict their behavior and form more meaningful relationships with them. While people can have mixed characteristics, understanding archetypes can give us valuable insights into their actions and personalities. By applying this concept to our daily lives, we can navigate social situations more effectively and build stronger connections with others.",
    "Introduction\n\nThe evolution of attitudes towards romantic relationships and marriage is a reflection of societal progress. The trends emerging among Gen Z are particularly insightful and can be used to analyze the current state of affairs in this area (Klein, 2022). It is evident that individuals' perspectives are shaped by external factors, which suggests a correlation between views on love and sex and personal well-being. Therefore, it is essential to consider both human factors and environmental conditions when examining the accompanying phenomena and cause-and-effect relationships.\n\nSummary of the Article\n\nIn her article, \"Are Gen Z more pragmatic about love and sex?\", Jessica Klein explores the tendency among Gen Z to delay marriage and avoid long-term relationships, instead prioritizing personal growth. Unlike previous generations, Gen Z does not view marriage as a natural step towards adulthood. This shift is attributed to several factors, including the appeal of single life, the need for financial stability, and the desire to carefully choose a partner in the face of pandemic-related challenges (Klein, 2022). As a result, the pace of relationships has slowed, and the focus has shifted from interactions with others to self-reflection.\n\nResponse Evidence\n\nThe article is an effective piece of writing due to its incorporation of evidence from diverse sources, including qualitative and quantitative studies. Klein (2022) cites multiple surveys and statistical data from official institutions, as well as analyzes the current trends in Gen Z relationships through the lens of previous generations' experiences. This approach lends credibility to the findings and supports the reliability of the conclusions. The inclusion of personal opinions alongside the studies adds depth to the publication, making it a comprehensive and well-supported piece.",
    "This study summarizes sport fisheries in the Anchorage Management Area from 2016 to 2018. It provides a description and historical background of each fishery, as well as information on current management practices and performance data. The report reveals that reductions in fish stocks and sizes in locally stocked lakes have negatively impacted local fisheries' popularity and productivity.\n\nThe study also examines sport fisheries in the North Gulf Coast Management Area, offering an overview of each fishery, management practices, and performance data from 2016 to 2018. As an official report from the Alaska fishing authority, it is a reliable source of statistical information.\n\nAdditionally, a case study explores the complex factors that influence diversity in Alaskan fisheries, a globally significant fishing region. By analyzing harvest data and literature reviews, the study examines changes in participation and portfolio diversity over three decades. It also investigates how fishers, fleets, and communities respond to interconnected stressors such as biological declines, market dynamics, and fisheries privatization. As an expert-verified article, it provides reliable and accurate information, making it a valuable resource for research on current trends and factors affecting sport fishing.",
    "Deductive reasoning is a process of establishing robust cause-and-effect relationships, where a connection is formed between two facts or a point and its potential future implications (Besnard & Hunter, 2018). A logical judgment consists of two essential components: the prerequisites (premises) and the conclusion. In logic, an argument is considered valid only if its structure ensures that it is impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion to be false.\n\nThere are three types of deductive arguments, and a valid statement does not necessarily require trustworthy premises. However, it must have premises that, if accurate, would guarantee a proper conclusion. For instance:\n\n1. All metals are heavy\n2. Tin is a metal\n3. Therefore, Tin is heavy\n\nA sound argument must possess both a valid form and true premises. While valid arguments can be unsound due to incorrect assumptions, they still maintain a logical necessity. For example:\n\n1. All dogs are cats\n2. All mice are dogs\n3. Therefore, All mice are cats\n\nWhat makes this argument valid is not the truth of its premises or conclusion but the logical coherence of the judgment, given the assumptions. However, it is crucial to recognize that the ultimate goal of argumentation is to establish the truth of a judgment. An invalid argument fails to achieve this goal and cannot be considered sound (Besnard & Hunter, 2018).\n\nA sound argument, by definition, has a valid form and true premises, ensuring that it cannot be invalid in all cases. If an argument is invalid, the premises become irrelevant, and only the conclusion remains. This means that there is no argument, let alone a sound one, in such cases.",
    "Aristotle's groundbreaking discovery of variables revolutionized the field of logic, transforming it from a collection of specific doctrines to a scientific study of syllogistic laws, such as modus ponens and modus tollens. By abstracting from the content of various judgments, formal logic reveals a common structure underlying diverse objects. Aristotle's pioneering work on syllogisms, which includes defining and categorizing different types, identifying effective and ineffective forms, and establishing three figures of syllogism, remains a cornerstone of logical reasoning.\n\nWhat's particularly remarkable is that Aristotle was the first to subject reasoning methods to scientific scrutiny, treating them as integrated systems rather than isolated components. In contrast, earlier logical endeavors focused on individual methods and principles without attempting to unify them into a coherent system. Aristotle's introduction of concepts like modus ponens and modus tollens laid the foundation for understanding the truth of thinking, paving the way for the development of modern logic.\n\nAs an independent field of knowledge, modern logic emerged from the convergence of philosophy and mathematics. While it has become a highly advanced and technical discipline, it has lost some of the philosophical nuances that characterized its predecessors. Often referred to as mathematical logic, modern logic relies on exact sciences and computer technology, eschewing ambiguity in favor of precision. Built on artificial language and intelligence, modern logic, although impressive in its own right, lacks the richness and complexity of traditional logical concepts.",

    "The adversarial criminal justice system is designed to ensure equal application of the law to all members of society. This system presumes innocence until proven guilty, placing the burden of proof on the prosecution to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. If any doubt remains, the advantage lies with the defendant. The accused has the right to remain silent and cannot be forced to respond to accusations. While this system provides essential safeguards, it also raises ethical concerns as these protections often favor the accused.\n\nThe rights granted to the defendant, including the right to appeal, remain silent, have an attorney, and be free from unauthorized searches and arrests, can create a disadvantage for the prosecution. This imbalance can lead to a biased system, making it more challenging for the prosecution to prove its case. The adversarial nature of the system can also encourage the use of questionable legal tactics and deception rather than relying on facts to settle cases.\n\nA significant ethical problem arises when the system fails to ensure justice is served. For instance, racial biases in the American judicial system and policing lead to disparities in arrest rates and sentencing. A black man is five times more likely to be arrested than a white woman for the same offense. Furthermore, a black man is more likely to be convicted and receive a longer prison sentence than a white man for the same crime. According to the United States Sentencing Commission, a black man may receive a prison term nearly 20% longer than a white man for the same crime. These disparities are a result of racism and bias within the American criminal justice system.\n\nTo address these ethical concerns, it is essential to ensure that both parties present facts before judgment is made, reducing the likelihood of injustices. By doing so, the system can work towards providing fair and equal treatment for all individuals, regardless of race or background.",
    "Unraveling the mysteries of religions and philosophies is a fascinating journey, and for me, understanding their origins is key to grasping their context and content. Take Jainism, for instance, which has a rich history spanning an astonishing 2500 years - a staggering 2000 years older than its more well-known counterpart, Sikhism. Despite both being deeply rooted in Hinduism, their approaches couldn't be more different. Sikhism, with its militaristic take on monotheism, is a relatively modern phenomenon, emerging only about 500 years ago. In contrast, Jainism's radical rejection of a Creator God, instead embracing the idea that the universe is governed by natural forces, is a refreshing departure from traditional theology.\n\nWhat I find particularly intriguing is how a religion interacts with the world around it. Jainism's bold stance on the non-existence of a Creator raises thought-provoking questions that resonate with atheistic circles. For instance, if God is perfect, why create an imperfect world? Or, if God loves all life, why permit suffering? Jainism even poses a logical conundrum: if everything in the universe needs a creator, wouldn't God itself require creation? This forward-thinking worldview is surprisingly modern and potentially controversial for its time.\n\nEthics play a vital role in any belief system, and Jainism is no exception. Its five core principles - Ahimsa (non-violence), Satya (truth), Astheya (non-stealing), Brahmacharya (chastity), and Aparigraha (non-possession) - form the backbone of its moral code. Ahimsa, in particular, resonates deeply with me. I believe that many religions justify violence under the guise of faith, which goes against my personal values. Jainism, on the other hand, places non-violence at the forefront, making it an inexcusable offense. This unwavering commitment to compassion is a powerful testament to the enduring relevance of Jainism's ancient wisdom.",
    "Cultural understanding is a two-way street, and it's essential to recognize that we often view other cultures through the lens of our own. This phenomenon is known as ethnocentrism, where our perspectives are shaped by our cultural background. For instance, when an American chain opens in a developing country, it's met with excitement, whereas in Canada, it's just another fast food joint (Noah 188). As a Canadian, I've come to realize that our cultural norms, like excessive politeness, are often misunderstood by others. \n\nThe book highlights how historical events, like colonialism, have contributed to the current state of affairs in many countries. As Noah notes, \"Westerners are shocked and confused by that, but it's a case of the West reaping what it has sown\" (Noah 194). This lack of understanding also extends to our perception of leaders. In Canada, we often assume that our leaders embody true democracy, but the reality is that they, too, face power struggles and may not always act in the nation's best interests. \n\nWhat's fascinating is how different cultures perceive historical figures, like Hitler, who is viewed as a madman in the West but seen as just another strongman in Africa (Noah 196). This highlights the importance of cultural awareness and understanding in today's globalized world. By recognizing our own biases and limitations, we can work towards a more nuanced and empathetic understanding of other cultures.",
    "**What is Globalization?**\n\nGlobalization refers to the free flow of information, investments, trade, political cooperation, cultural values, and social ideas between different countries. This phenomenon has created a borderless world for managers, allowing them to operate internationally, hire employees from diverse backgrounds, source raw materials from the best suppliers, and sell products in various markets.\n\n**Benefits and Risks of a Borderless World**\n\nWhile globalization presents many opportunities for managers, it also comes with risks such as information security threats and cultural differences. To succeed in this environment, managers need to develop a global mindset, which involves recognizing and influencing people or organizations with different cultural, social, political, and psychological backgrounds.\n\n**The Importance of a Global Mindset**\n\nIn today's international business landscape, managers constantly interact with individuals from diverse perspectives. To ensure effective operations and collaboration, managers must be able to understand these perspectives and adapt to different worldviews. This is particularly important for international companies, as they operate in a rapidly changing global environment.\n\n**The Rise of Emerging Markets**\n\nThe global business landscape is shifting, with countries like China, India, and Brazil experiencing rapid economic growth. China, for example, has attracted more foreign investments than any other country and has increased its number of Fortune Global 500 companies from 16 in 2005 to 98 in 2015. India, on the other hand, is driving economic growth through services, software design, and precision engineering.\n\n**Multinational Corporations (MNCs)**\n\nA multinational corporation (MNC) is a company that generates more than 25% of its revenue from operations in countries other than its home country. MNCs are characterized by close cooperation among affiliates in different countries and a single management authority making key decisions for the parent company and all affiliates. MNC managers have a global perspective, viewing the world as one market.\n\n**Entry Strategies for International Business**\n\nThere are several entry strategies for companies looking to expand internationally. These include:\n\n* **Outsourcing**: Participating in a global division of labor to complete certain activities in locations with the cheapest raw materials and labor.\n* **Exporting**: Producing goods in the home country and transferring them to other countries for sale.\n* **Licensing**: Granting firms in other countries access to specific resources, such as technology or trademark rights, to produce and sell products abroad.\n* **Direct Investing**: Managing production facilities in another country.\n\nI hope this rewritten version is more reader-friendly and easier to understand!",
    "The independent variable in this study was a helpful message on the back of the dining check, highlighting upcoming specials. The dependent variable was the percentage of the bill left as a tip for the waiter. By focusing on tip percentage, this study sheds light on the tipping culture in restaurants. However, potential confounding variables include food quality, server gender, dining party size, and whether customers were regulars. The study's strengths lie in its transparent design, simplicity of implementation, and potential for replication in different settings. \n\nHowever, the message's content varied depending on the special, which may have appealed differently to customers. Moreover, the study was limited to a single restaurant, making it difficult to generalize the findings to different types of establishments. These factors could impact the tipping outcomes and, consequently, the study results. It is also unclear whether the mere presence of a personalized message or the message content itself drove the outcome. \n\nTo address this, the authors could have asked waiters to write different messages, including some with no useful content, to evaluate the effect. Additionally, the researchers could have used alternative arrangements, such as randomly assigning waiters instead of dining parties. Several aspects of this study could impact its internal validity, including varying attitudes that may affect the final tip and undermine the causal relationship. \n\nFurthermore, some hypothetical aspects could limit the research's external validity. For instance, if the waiter was a young female adult, it would be challenging to apply the same conclusions to male waiters and older servers due to the potential gender factor. Similarly, if the study was conducted at a private country club, extrapolating the results to high-class restaurants and casual diners would be unreliable. \n\nLastly, the study only used two groups, servers and dining parties, with no size specification. The authors could have employed a third group of solo dining parties to separate groups from those dining alone, allowing them to address the question of group size effect and individual, interpersonal interactions. Implementing the design with solo dining parties would also address the effect of gender on the outcome.",

Their work, published in the peer-reviewed journal Current Psychology, meets the journal's quality requirements and is accessible through the Jerry Falwell Library.",
    "**Exploring the Diverse World of Creation Myths and Art**\n\nHave you ever wondered how different cultures around the world explain the origins of the universe and humanity? From the Aztecs to Europeans, each civilization has its own unique creation myths and artistic styles that reflect their beliefs.\n\n**The Christian Story**\n\nIn Christianity, God is seen as a loving father who created humans in his own image and gave them dominion over a perfect world, the Garden of Eden. He's often depicted in art as a wise, older man with a beard and white hair. Christian art focuses on God's power to forgive and the beauty of the natural world he created.\n\n**The Aztec Perspective**\n\nIn contrast, Aztec creation stories are rooted in violent, catastrophic events, where dismembered gods gave birth to the world. Their art reflects this, depicting gods as fierce and awe-inspiring. Aztec art serves as a warning and a call to obey, with sculptures featuring receptacles for human hearts as a symbol of the blood sacrifices needed to ensure food and survival.\n\n**Key Differences**\n\nWhile both Christian and Aztec gods are considered perfect and self-contained, the Aztec gods operate outside the concepts of good and evil. In Christianity, evil is seen as the domain of Satan, the opposite of God. This fundamental difference is reflected in the art styles of each culture. Christian art emphasizes forgiveness and love, while Aztec art is centered around survival through violence.\n\n**A World of Contrasts**\n\nBy exploring these diverse creation myths and artistic styles, we gain a deeper understanding of the values and beliefs that shape different cultures. Whether it's the loving, forgiving God of Christianity or the bloodthirsty, violent goddess of the Aztecs, each culture's unique perspective offers a fascinating glimpse into the human experience.",
    "Nursing is all about getting better and better. To do this, nurses need to keep up with the latest trends and research in healthcare. One way to do this is to use something called evidence-based practice (EBP). This means using the latest research to improve patient care. However, many nurses don't use EBP because they are too busy and don't have the resources they need. They also don't get enough support from their organizations or teams.\n\nTo make EBP happen, we need to make some changes. First, leaders need to set a good example and provide training and workshops to encourage nurses to use EBP. We also need to make it easier for nurses to access research and information at work. This means providing them with good databases, internet access, and subscriptions to medical journals. If we do this, nurses will be able to use research more easily and without feeling too stressed.",
    "Beowulf stands tall as one of the most iconic ancient European poems, its legendary status undeniable. While its origins remain shrouded in mystery, the prevailing narrative describes it as a \"Danish poem in the Anglo-Saxon dialect\" (Neidorf 847). This epic tale follows the extraordinary life and feats of Beowulf, a hero hailed as a heaven-sent savior for humanity (Gummere line 13). With unwavering bravery, he battles the monstrous Grendel and its mother to rescue King Hrothgar and the Danes. Later, as the king himself, Beowulf faces his greatest challenge yet: a fire-breathing dragon terrorizing his kingdom. Though he ultimately slays the beast, Beowulf succumbs to mortal wounds, leaving behind a legacy that continues to captivate and inspire.\n\nOn a deeper level, this poem masterfully explores fundamental aspects of human existence. One of the most striking themes is the quest for identity, where individuals are inextricably linked to their ancestral heritage. Beowulf's desire for recognition and honor drives him to seek out great deeds and fame, highlighting the importance of self-discovery and reputation. As the poem unfolds, we see Beowulf mature into a wise and responsible leader, grappling with the weight of kingship and the value of putting his people's lives above personal glory. Finally, the poem probes the tension between personal values, the heroic code, and the conflicting influences of Christian and pagan beliefs. This rich tapestry of themes serves as a powerful reminder of the complexities and nuances of human nature, defying simplistic categorization and embracing the beauty of moral ambiguity.",
    "Beowulf, an Anglo-Saxon epic poem, tells the story of a hero who lived in Jutland before the Angles moved to Britain. The poem's main character, Beowulf, became a revered hero in Old English literature and has had a significant influence on popular culture. His bravery, strength, and selflessness continue to captivate modern audiences, who are drawn to his archetypal clarity and wholeness.\n\nBeowulf's character shares similarities with modern superheroes, such as Superman, who also possess incredible strength and serve as role models for their people. Both types of heroes must overcome challenges to help those in need, and their physical abilities are admired and revered. However, modern audiences require more than just physical strength from their heroes; they also expect purity of thought and good intentions.\n\nDespite the differences between ancient and modern heroes, people continue to draw inspiration from old stories, which is in line with postmodernist theory. This theory suggests that we must constantly reinterpret and reimagine the past to make sense of it and experiment with its content. The ongoing relevance of legendary superheroes to contemporary audiences demonstrates that bravery, loyalty, and other heroic qualities remain highly valued.",
    "Unlock the Secret to Successful Implementation: The P-O-L-C Framework\n\nImagine a company on the brink of collapse, plagued by serious issues and market challenges. What sets apart the winners from the losers? The answer lies in the effective implementation of the P-O-L-C framework, which hinges on several crucial factors. Neglect these, and you risk facing catastrophic consequences, as exemplified by the infamous collapse of WorldCom in 2002.\n\nThe WorldCom debacle, one of the largest accounting scandals in US history, serves as a stark reminder of the devastating effects of poor communication within a corporation. The inability of top managers and accountants to communicate efficiently led to a perfect storm of fraud, ultimately resulting in the company's downfall. Bernard Ebbers, the mastermind behind WorldCom's rapid growth, found himself entangled in a web of conspiracy, securities fraud, and false statements.\n\nBut what led to this downfall? The answer lies in the lack of quality communication within the company. A staggering 80% of employees feel their opinions are ignored, creating a toxic environment where self-interest reigns supreme. The top brass, driven by motive distortion and extreme self-absorption, prioritized their own interests over the company's well-being. This led to a culture of misinformation, where only convenient data was shared, and the truth was distorted.\n\nThe consequences were dire. The company's top managers turned against each other, with Ebbers and his subordinates claiming ignorance of the fraudulent schemes. The once-thriving telecom giant crumbled, a victim of its own internal communication barriers. The lesson is clear: effective communication is the backbone of any successful organization. Neglect it, and you risk facing the same fate as WorldCom.",
    "Have you heard of the Bhagavad Gita? It's an ancient Indian scripture that's part of the epic Mahabharata, and it's a big deal in Hinduism. The book is made up of 700 verses and dates back to around 500 BC.\n\nThe story takes place during a conversation between Arjuna, a prince, and Krishna, his guide and charioteer who just happens to be the supreme God incarnate. Krishna helps Arjuna figure out what to do when faced with some tough moral choices, especially when it comes to fighting against his own family members, the Kauravas.\n\nArjuna is a complex guy - he's confident, but also arrogant and proud. He's an amazing warrior, but he's also struggling with what's right and wrong. Krishna, on the other hand, is the ultimate symbol of wisdom, humility, and kindness. The two of them have a super close relationship, and their conversation is the heart of the Bhagavad Gita.\n\nThe book is still super relevant today because it talks about universal themes like morality, justice, and doing what's right. Arjuna and Krishna's conversation gets deep, covering topics like identity crises, the purpose of life, and what it means to be human.\n\nOne of the most famous scenes in the book is when Arjuna asks Krishna to take him to the middle of the battlefield, where he sees his friends and family on the other side. He's torn and doesn't want to fight them, so he starts questioning Krishna about the whole situation. It's a really powerful and thought-provoking moment in the book.\n\nOverall, the Bhagavad Gita is an amazing book that's still widely read and studied today. It's a must-read for anyone interested in Indian culture, philosophy, or just wanting to explore some of life's biggest questions.",
    "TED Talks illustrate bio-psycho-social-spiritual developmental issues that lead to social exclusion. Examples include racial differences in child-rearing (Smith, 2015) and biased treatment of Muslim women based on clothing (Abdel-Magied, 2014). Discrimination stems from bias, which can be automatic, ambiguous, or ambivalent (Fiske, 2022). This bias affects people's self-esteem and confidence, as seen in the experiences of non-white individuals in the US (New York Times, 2016). I'm interested in exploring racial bias, particularly its structural manifestations, due to its relevance today.",
    "The documentary 'Coded Bias' blows the lid off the alarming biases embedded in facial recognition algorithms, exposing the root causes of these flaws. At the heart of the problem lies the original sin of creators who prioritized white faces, resulting in a glaring lack of data on darker complexions. To make matters worse, the predominantly male developers brought their own prejudices to the table, perpetuating a toxic cycle of inequality. The consequences are far-reaching, threatening to undermine the entire field by failing to cater to diverse needs.\n\nThe lack of transparency in how these programs process data and draw conclusions only adds fuel to the fire, making it impossible to mitigate the risks. So, what's the solution? For starters, we need to put the brakes on using these biased algorithms in legal proceedings and police work. We must also revamp the system from the ground up, starting with diverse database updates and independent assessments to ensure efficiency. By taking these crucial steps, we can gradually eliminate race and gender biases, guaranteeing a higher quality of operations.\n\nBut that's not all - these measures can also help resolve the pressing issue of surveillance and its disproportionate impact on racialized minorities. The key lies in establishing clear accountability for decisions, which can only be achieved if algorithms function correctly and internal and external evaluations are in sync. The future of facial recognition technology in investigations hangs in the balance, contingent upon the efforts of experts to tackle these pressing concerns and address the critical issues raised by Nakamura and Browne.",
    "The Caribbean's rich and tumultuous history is marked by the brutal colonization of Western powers, particularly Spain, which ravaged the indigenous populations and imposed a reign of terror upon the native inhabitants. Prior to the arrival of these colonizers, the region was inhabited by various native groups, including the Ciboney, Guanahuatebey, Taino Arawak, and Carib, each with their unique cultural practices and traditions. The colonizers, driven by their insatiable thirst for power and resources, brought with them a large contingent of enslaved Africans, who were forced to toil in their homes and plantations under the yoke of oppression. Despite being vastly outnumbered, the White colonizers wielded absolute power, subjecting the Black majority to a regime of brutal subjugation. However, the enslaved Africans and their descendants refused to be erased, instead, they found solace in their cultural heritage, which became a powerful tool of resistance and self-expression. The Caribbean region has given birth to a plethora of musical genres that celebrate human freedom and revolution, with Reggae being an iconic representation of the Caribbean people's struggle for liberation. Legendary Reggae musicians like Bob Marley and the Wailers crafted powerful, redemption-filled songs that protested against the White brutal rule, giving voice to the anger and frustration of the oppressed Black majority. Through Reggae, the Caribbean people found a means to express their outrage against the ruthless White control, which had ravaged their communities for centuries. The African diaspora in the Caribbean also maintained a strong connection to their ancestral heritage, evident in their cuisine, customs, and religious beliefs. The enslaved people preserved their African culinary traditions, cherishing dishes like Callaloo, a beloved vegetable soup that has become a national staple in Tobago and Trinidad. Furthermore, the vibrant carnivals and parades that dot the Caribbean landscape are a testament to the region's rich folklore and customs, which are deeply rooted in African traditions. These festivities serve as a means of commemorating the region's complex history, including the transatlantic slave trade and the struggles of the enslaved people. The distinct African heritage in the Caribbean has played a pivotal role in shaping the identity of the Black population, who, despite being subjected to brutal colonization, have managed to preserve their cultural practices and traditions. The Caribbean's history is a testament to the resilience and creativity of the Black people, who, in the face of overwhelming oppression, have found ways to express themselves, assert their identity, and celebrate their heritage through music, art, and cultural practices that continue to thrive to this day.",
    "Society has long been a crucial institution shaping the development of states. Through group interactions, people share values, opinions, and reactions to various phenomena, ultimately influencing politics and forming a collective lifestyle. This is why changes in civic life have significant implications for states. In his essay \"Bowling Alone,\" Robert Putnam emphasizes the importance of social engagement, warning that the decline of civic life in the USA is a cause for concern. Historically, active participation in social processes has been a hallmark of American society, but this trend is reversing. Putnam notes that \"tens of millions of Americans had forsaken their parents' habitual readiness to engage in the simplest act of citizenship\" (67), indicating a shift towards isolation and disengagement. Furthermore, traditional community organizations are being replaced by mass membership organizations, which, although politically influential, do not foster civic engagement. As Putnam observes, \"for the vast majority of their members, the only act of membership consists in writing a check for dues or perhaps occasionally reading a newsletter\" (70). This trend of disconnection and disengagement among community members is alarming, as it may ultimately lead to the collapse of civic life. The long-term consequences of this decline are unpredictable, particularly in a country like the USA, which has traditionally been built on strong community relationships. If this trend continues, Putnam warns, we risk becoming isolated individuals, \"bowling alone\" without meaningful connections to others.",
    "Genetic predisposition is a crucial contributor to the development of breast cancer, as it can lead to a hereditary disease. If a patient's immediate family members have been diagnosed with breast cancer, the risk of tumor formation increases, even at a young age (Coleman & Tsongalis, 2016). Given the patient's family history, it is likely that she may also be at risk. Another significant risk factor is the presence of certain mammary gland conditions, such as cystic breasts. These conditions can lead to the formation of abnormal cells in the breast tissue, which can then proliferate and increase the risk of more severe diseases (Tkaczuk et al., 2016). Hormonal influences also play a critical role in breast cancer development. In this case, the patient's hormonal profile is particularly significant due to factors such as delayed first pregnancy, lack of breastfeeding, and prolonged use of hormonal contraceptives. This can disrupt the body's hormonal balance, making it more challenging to regulate abnormal cellular processes with age (Tkaczuk et al., 2016). If breast cancer is detected at an early stage, it may not have spread to other organs. However, aggressive forms of cancer can exhibit rapid metastasis. To prevent future health issues, it is essential to employ various diagnostic methods. A histological analysis of tissue can determine the aggressiveness of the cancer type at an early stage. Imaging techniques such as CT or scintigraphy can detect breast cancer metastases in organs like the lungs, liver, bones, and brain. It is important to note that breast cancer metastases can remain dormant for extended periods, even five to ten years after the primary tumor has been removed.",
    "Etihad Airways' decision to lay off employees based on age and disability was a shocking breach of international labor laws. This move not only undermined social justice, a core expectation of multinational corporations, but also sparked a chain reaction of negative consequences. By excluding employees from the decision-making process, Etihad Airways created a toxic work environment, eroding trust and motivation among its workforce.\n\nThe lack of employee involvement led to a discriminatory approach, ignoring the very people who are essential to the company's success. This short-sighted strategy resulted in a devastating loss of confidence, motivation, and job security among employees. The consequences were far-reaching, with remaining employees struggling with burnout, stress, and disengagement.\n\nEtihad Airways' failure to prioritize employee involvement and fair decision-making processes had a direct impact on its ability to achieve its objectives. The company's misguided attempt to cut costs by laying off employees based on age and disability ultimately hindered its performance and compromised its reputation.\n\nThis case serves as a stark reminder of the critical importance of employee involvement in decision-making during times of change. By empowering employees to participate in the decision-making process, companies can ensure that fair and inclusive decisions are made, motivating employees to drive success and growth. Etihad Airways' mistake is a valuable lesson for corporations worldwide: prioritize employee involvement, and reap the benefits of a motivated, engaged, and productive workforce.",
    "Effective management is crucial for any business, and attention to detail is essential. However, healthcare facilities require even more scrutiny due to their critical role in maintaining people's health and well-being. Managing such facilities can be exhausting, costly, and mentally draining. As a Chief Nursing Officer, one must adhere to key principles, including upholding integrity, managing finances, and motivating employees. \n\nFirst and foremost, a healthcare business must prioritize integrity. Open communication is vital in any industry, and integrity is a fundamental aspect of this (Fisher, 2008). In our facility, we strictly adhere to this principle. For instance, our doctors follow a strict ethical code, ensuring confidentiality and honest communication with patients. I personally make it a point to inform patients about their conditions and answer their questions truthfully.\n\nAnother essential principle is prudent financial management. Healthcare facilities require continuous upgrades and innovations, which necessitate investments in new equipment and repairs (Mason et al., 2020). It is crucial to implement these changes to ensure patients' health and well-being are not compromised. For example, I oversaw the replacement of power generators, enabling our staff to work uninterrupted during a storm and power outage.\n\nLastly, employee motivation and management are critical. In a healthcare setting, it is vital to recognize and reward employees' hard work. In our facility, we offer extra days off and gift cards to show appreciation for their efforts. This fosters a sense of being heard and supported, preventing burnout and ensuring high-quality results.\n\nThese principles were chosen due to their significant impact on employees and patients. By implementing these principles, we have achieved positive outcomes and satisfied all parties involved. I firmly believe that healthcare should be built on these values; otherwise, no facility can provide quality care, and trust and respect between healthcare personnel and patients will be lost.",
    "The enduring presence of mythology in human culture has long captivated scholars and thinkers. In his seminal work, \"The Hero with a Thousand Faces,\" Joseph Campbell delves into the psychological underpinnings of myth, revealing how it shapes cultural patterns and human behavior. This paper will focus on the first chapter, \"Myth and Dream,\" which explores the intricate relationship between myths and dreams. Campbell posits that myths are both threatening and fascinating, as they \"carry keys that open the whole realm of the desired and feared adventure of the discovery of the self\" (Campbell, 2004, p. 7). This notion suggests that people's minds intertwine myths and dreams to facilitate self-perception, understand their place in the life cycle, and cope with developmental changes. Myths guide individuals through life's challenges, integrating the conscious and subconscious into a cohesive framework. Campbell illustrates this idea by highlighting the recurring themes of ancient mythology in contemporary dreams, where motifs of hatred, vanity, and jealousy coexist with love, gratitude, and other emotions. These themes are dangerous because they expose the subconscious psychological underpinnings that contradict rational decision-making. Through examples of myth-like dreams, such as a young man's dream of killing his father to gain his mother's attention, Campbell demonstrates how these dreams reflect subconscious struggles and concerns. The connection between early childhood experiences and adulthood is crucial in understanding the manifestation of myths in dreams. Ultimately, Campbell's work reveals that by confronting the contradictions in myth-like dreams, individuals can gain insight into their emotions, behaviors, and the subconscious triggers that drive them.",
    "Recent fad diets have mistakenly claimed that carbohydrates are harmful to the body. However, this notion is incorrect for several reasons. Carbohydrates are essential for a healthy body, providing vital energy for the nervous system, brain, and proper metabolism of proteins and fats. Without them, fatigue, depression, and weight gain are likely to occur. In fact, eliminating carbohydrates can lead to increased appetite, super-compensation, and rapid weight regain. Additionally, a carb-free diet can cause headaches, migraines, and impaired brain function due to reduced concentration and cognitive abilities. As the primary source of energy for the brain, carbohydrates are crucial for proper bodily function. It is essential to include them in your diet to maintain overall health.",

    "The Rolling Stones often felt overshadowed by the Beatles, who dominated the music scene from the start. While the Beatles basked in the spotlight, the Rolling Stones sought to differentiate themselves by adopting an anti-Beatles persona. Interestingly, the Beatles are credited with pioneering hard rock, with their song \"Helter Skelter\" influencing the emergence of heavy metal. Meanwhile, the Rolling Stones' impact on rock music cannot be overstated, extending beyond music to artistic, visual, and mass media realms.\n\nIn terms of songwriting, the Rolling Stones struggled to keep pace with the Beatles, often reacting to their competitors' innovations. For instance, when the Beatles incorporated the sitar into their music, the Rolling Stones quickly followed suit. The two bands also cultivated distinct images: the Beatles, with their working-class Liverpool roots, projected an elegant, refined persona, while the Rolling Stones adopted a provocative, rebellious stance, donning black leather and flaunting their bad-boy attitude.\n\nThe Beatles' 1964 US debut, dubbed the \"British Invasion,\" saw them dominate the Billboard singles chart, a feat unmatched by any other artist. While the Rolling Stones also achieved success in the US, largely through their shocking antics, they failed to dislodge the Beatles from their top spot. Despite their differences, both bands have left an indelible mark on global music, earning them recognition as two of the most iconic rock bands of the 1960s.",
    "Meet Robert, a bright and determined 23-year-old who's been bravely facing the challenges of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). This chronic condition is marked by recurring, intrusive thoughts and behaviors that can be overwhelming, but Robert is taking steps towards healing.\n\nWhen Robert first sought help at a mental health facility, he was struggling with anxiety. However, it soon became clear that OCD was the underlying issue, driven by his intense fear of germs. Simple actions like touching surfaces or shaking hands would trigger an intense urge to wash his hands with bleach - sometimes up to 30 times a day. The toll on his skin was significant, but the fear of contamination was even stronger.\n\nThe pandemic only exacerbated Robert's symptoms, leading him to take extreme measures like wearing a HAZMAT suit in public. Social interactions became daunting, and he began to avoid physical contact with others, preferring to keep his distance. Working from home became a refuge, allowing him to maintain control over his environment.\n\nDespite these challenges, Robert is determined to overcome his OCD. With the right treatment, he can learn to manage his symptoms and regain control over his life. A combination of behavior therapy and medication offers a promising solution. Cognitive-behavioral therapy, including exposure and response prevention, can help Robert confront his fears and rewire his thoughts. With time and patience, Robert can expect to find relief from his symptoms and start living the life he deserves.\n\nIn this rewritten version, I've aimed to create a more empathetic tone by using words like \"bravely,\" \"bright,\" and \"determined\" to describe Robert. I've also emphasized his strengths and resilience, rather than focusing solely on his struggles. The language is more hopeful and encouraging, with a focus on the potential for healing and recovery.",
    "A thorough examination of the affected skin areas is crucial in diagnosing cellulitis. Typically, patients with this condition exhibit a reddened, swollen, and painful skin region (Brown & Watson, 2022). Brant's symptoms, including pain in his right leg, redness, and swelling, are consistent with this diagnosis. The affected area should be carefully inspected for any signs of skin breakdown, and temperature variations should be monitored, along with any signs of abscess formation (Sutherland & Parent, 2017). Notably, Brant reported being bitten by a mosquito in the affected area, which may have introduced bacteria into the skin.\n\nGiven the severity of Brant's symptoms, the physician may order a complete blood count (CBC) test to measure blood count levels (Bennett et al., 2020). This test can help diagnose a range of medical conditions. Additionally, a C-reactive protein (CRP) test may be ordered to assess inflammation, particularly since Brant has broken skin due to the mosquito bite (Sutherland & Parent, 2017). Brant's symptoms, including chills and acute disorientation, suggest a significant systemic disturbance.\n\nTo diagnose cellulitis, the physician must assess the presence of erythematous inflammation in the basal dermis and subcutaneous tissue. Redness, swelling, and pain are all indicative of cellulitis (Sutherland & Parent, 2017). Erythema must be present to confirm the diagnosis. The location and nature of broken skin should also be evaluated. In Brant's case, the presence of micro-abrasions from the insect bite is a key factor in the diagnosis (Brown & Watson, 2022).\n\nTo manage Brant's symptoms, his positioning and movement should be adjusted. Elevating his feet and arms on cushions while he lies on his back can help reduce swelling (Zariquiey-Esteva & Santa-Candela, 2017). If Brant stands for extended periods, it may impede blood flow to the heart, leading to low blood pressure. Placing him on his side in the recovery position, especially when he feels nauseated or vomits, can help prevent low blood pressure (Zariquiey-Esteva & Santa-Candela, 2017).\n\nThe underlying mechanism of cellulitis involves the release of cytokines and neutrophils into the bloodstream to combat invading germs. This response causes the characteristic symptoms of redness, warmth, swelling, and pain (Brown & Watson, 2022). In Brant's case, the mosquito bite introduced bacteria into the skin, triggering an immune response and resulting in the symptoms he is experiencing.",
    "In the ever-evolving landscape of healthcare, nurses must be agile and adaptable to stay ahead of the curve. To navigate this dynamic environment, researchers have developed a range of change theories that help systematize the process of implementing new practices. Among these, two theories stand out as game-changers in the nursing profession: Lewin's change theory and Roger's five-step theory.\n\nLewin's framework is a three-stage powerhouse that drives change forward. It begins with \"unfreezing\" the existing workflow, followed by active implementation of new practices, and culminates in \"refreezing\" the new standard. This approach is all about disrupting the status quo and embracing a new normal.\n\nIn contrast, Roger's model takes a more nuanced approach, focusing on the staff's response and acceptance of change. This five-step process involves exhaustive research, feedback gathering, pilot testing, and implementation. It's a gradual, evidence-based approach that proves the value of change before rolling it out.\n\nWhen it comes to our capstone project, Roger's approach is the perfect fit. By using his model, we can justify the benefits of EBP training on nurses' self-esteem and patient satisfaction, and pave the way for widespread adoption. And, as our preceptor can attest, Roger's model has already yielded impressive results in staff scheduling patterns. Get ready to revolutionize nursing practice with the power of change theory!",
    "To succeed, it's crucial to understand the difference between a leader and a regular employee. A good leader recognizes the importance of their team and helps them grow, whereas a flawed leader prioritizes financial gain over people. This can lead to unpleasant consequences and even human rights violations. A bad leader views employees as cheap labor, lacking empathy and humanism. This approach ultimately fails, as top talent won't tolerate exploitation. The main mistake of many leaders is their egocentric worldview and tendency to exploit others for personal gain.",
    "Establishing a comprehensive contract is a crucial task for any organization, as it ensures that all parties involved are aware of their obligations and can meet them accordingly. Charles Schwab, a leading banking and brokerage services provider, has developed a model contract that exemplifies best practices in contract development. By incorporating all essential components of a legal agreement, Schwab's contract sets a clear foundation for collaboration between the company and its customers (Reder et al., 2021).\n\nThe contract begins by clearly defining key terms and concepts, establishing a strong foundation for the agreement. It then outlines the offer, acceptance, and legality terms in a transparent and easily understandable manner, promoting trust and cooperation from the outset (Templin, 2017). Furthermore, the contract provides a robust basis for the consideration element, addressing legal issues related to the disbursement process and trading concerns (\"Schwab account agreement,\" 2022). By clearly outlining the responsibilities of both parties, including Schwab's limited role in tracking the trading process, the contract establishes a clear understanding of the parties' roles and relationships.\n\nBy incorporating all primary components of a legal contract, Schwab's brokerage agreement empowers customers to understand the services they will receive and their associated responsibilities. Similarly, the contract outlines Schwab's key responsibilities, creating a basis for successful cooperation and delivery of the end product. Overall, Schwab's approach to contract development serves as a prime example of how a contract should be structured, with a close focus on key issues and a clear delineation of all parties' roles and rights.",
    "**Primary vs. Secondary Sources: Understanding the Difference**\n\nWhen conducting research, it's essential to distinguish between primary and secondary sources. Primary sources provide firsthand evidence of events or phenomena, offering an unfiltered view of the subject matter. Examples of primary sources include diaries, photographs, audio and video recordings, interview transcripts, artworks, statistical data, and more. These sources allow researchers to gather information directly from those who witnessed or experienced the event. For instance, when studying the Chernobyl Nuclear Plant Disaster, primary sources like reports, documents, local newspapers, photographs, and witness interviews provide unbiased facts and firsthand accounts.\n\n**The Value of Primary Sources**\n\nPrimary sources offer several benefits. They provide researchers with a direct window into the past, allowing them to immerse themselves in the atmosphere and circumstances surrounding the event. Additionally, primary sources can serve as both information sources and inspiration, as seen in the case of historians and archaeologists who study ancient fossils or tribal artifacts.\n\n**The Role of Secondary Sources**\n\nSecondary sources, on the other hand, offer second-hand information and analysis from other researchers. Examples of secondary sources include books, reviews, and scholarly articles. While primary sources provide a firsthand view, secondary sources enable researchers to synthesize the material and gain a deeper understanding of the subject.\n\n**Why Consult Multiple Sources?**\n\nBoth primary and secondary sources are crucial in research, as they complement each other. However, relying on just one or two sources is not enough. It's essential to consult a variety of sources to gather a comprehensive understanding of the subject. Each new source can provide valuable additional evidence, and when the same data appears in multiple sources, its credibility increases. Moreover, consulting different types of sources, such as articles and books, exposes researchers to diverse approaches to synthesizing data, allowing them to pose new questions and seek new answers. The more sources consulted, the better.",
    "The emergence of the Chesapeake colonies serves as a paradigmatic example of how slavery became an integral component of the societal fabric in these regions. The imperative to cultivate specific crops and utilize them for economic sustenance and survival precipitated a perpetual demand for a substantial workforce. However, the practice of employing indentured servants proved ineffective due to the finite nature of their contractual obligations. Consequently, novel sources of labor were requisite to maintain the agricultural sector. The resolution of this dilemma was a matter of existential necessity, as the inability to cultivate crops would have entailed catastrophic consequences for the entire community (Kidd, 2019). Under these circumstances, the development of slavery was an inevitability, as the exploitation of individuals stripped of their rights enabled the performance of diverse tasks without temporal limitations. This phenomenon laid the groundwork for the evolution of slavery, which subsequently became a fundamental institution in these regions. Conversely, the example of the Middle colonies corroborates the notion that the enslavement of individuals and their utilization as a cheap labor force was an unavoidable consequence. Although the pacifist principles of Quakerism initially predominated in these regions, settlers still required individuals to perform complex tasks and support the development of colonies. Given the limited influx of settlers, slavery emerged as a viable option to compensate for the labor deficit and establish a foundation for future expansion. This trend, analogous to that observed in the Middle and Chesapeake colonies, underscores the distinct attitudes towards slavery characteristic of people during that era (Huntley, 2019). They were willing to promote the further evolution of this institution as a central mechanism to support the development of the agricultural sector, which was critical for survival and enrichment.",
    "Imagine a world where learning is not just about absorbing information, but about discovering the deeper meaning and purpose behind it. This is the vision that Daniel Spanjer presents in his writing, where he reveals how the Christian worldview has shaped the study of Liberal Arts. He argues that humans are not just products of the world, but beings endowed with feelings and thoughts that transcend the natural realm (Spanjer 3). According to Spanjer, the pursuit of knowledge is not just about finding answers, but about understanding the world and our place in it. Thinkers, he claims, have the power to tackle even the most profound and surreal questions. They have developed a concept called \"worldview\" to describe this holistic approach to learning, scholarship, and experience (Spanjer 15). While disagreements may arise, time has a way of dispelling false beliefs, revealing the truth in all its glory.\n\nBrad Green takes this idea a step further, exploring the intricate connection between words and faith. He shows how language, when infused with transcendent realities and goals, becomes a powerful tool for communication and expression (Green). But when this transcendence is lost, language falls flat, losing its beauty and significance. Green reminds us that words have the power to shape our understanding of the world and our place in it, and that God's words, in particular, hold the key to humanity's salvation. It is only by following God's guidelines, as outlined in the Bible, that we can unlock the true meaning of language and speech.\n\nFinally, Dockery's reading highlights the profound impact of Christian faith on learning. He encourages us to think in Christian categories, to sanctify our thoughts and beliefs, and to seek God's guidance in all that we do (Dockery 4). By doing so, we can contribute to the greater good of society and promote gracious deeds. Dockery argues that it is only through faith-centered education that we can truly revive and transform our world. In this sense, the Christian worldview is not just a foundation for successful education, but a beacon of hope for a brighter future.",
    "Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation (NDT) is a prestigious, peer-reviewed European journal that serves as a comprehensive repository of scientific and clinical articles, meticulously examining the intricacies of dialysis, transplantation, and nephrology research. Notably, the NDT journal has earned the esteemed approval of the European Renal Association (ERA), thereby establishing its credibility as a trusted source of authoritative analysis and data for the global scientific community.\n\nFurthermore, an article from StatPearls, a reputable source included in the National Center for Biotechnological Information (NCBI), has been selected for its rigorous scientific standards and meticulous curation of research data. The NCBI, a premier institution, is responsible for disseminating and archiving information on scientifically validated research, thereby ensuring the highest level of academic integrity.\n\nThe article in question delves into the primary causes of chronic inflammation during the critical phase of end-stage renal failure, shedding light on the profound impact of the disease on clinical outcomes. The authors also elucidate the pivotal role of middle molecules as significant contributors to the onset of pathology. Moreover, the latest breakthroughs and research in dialysis are thoroughly reviewed, with the aim of stabilizing the situation and improving patient outcomes.\n\nEnd-stage kidney damage, a critical juncture in the progression of chronic renal failure, poses a significant threat to human life and health. At this stage, the disease has reached its final phase, characterized by a marked decline in urine excretion (diuresis). The initial symptoms are subtle, with a decrease in diuresis being the only observable indicator. As the disease advances to stage 2, additional symptoms emerge, including nausea and an increase in urine production. In stage 3, the fluid retention worsens, and diuresis ceases, leading to acute renal failure and a concomitant deterioration in overall well-being.\n\nThe treatment of end-stage kidney damage in adults typically involves pharmacological interventions. Chronic renal failure affects approximately 200-500 individuals per million, with an alarming annual increase of 10-12% in the affected population. Morbidities associated with end-stage renal disease lead to a drastic reduction in diuresis, often to near zero. In advanced cases, pulmonary edema develops, further complicating the condition. Currently, the prevalence rate of the disease stands at approximately 759 cases per million population, with an incidence rate of 144 new cases per million. Although the mortality rate has been declining, it still stands at a concerning 28%.\n\nDiagnosis of the disease typically involves a battery of tests, including blood tests to assess creatinine, potassium, and urea levels, as well as ultrasound imaging of the kidneys. In certain cases, catheterization of the renal pelvis and angiography of the kidneys may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.",
    "\"Step Right Up to the Cruelty Circus: The Unspoken Truth Behind the Big Top\"\n\nImagine a world where majestic elephants waltz to the polonaise, playful sea lions juggle balls with finesse, and powerful bears pedal bicycles with ease. Sounds like a thrilling spectacle, doesn't it? But behind the curtains of this seemingly magical world lies a dark reality. The truth is, these four-legged performers are forced to endure unnatural and inhumane treatment, all for the sake of human entertainment.\n\nAnimal rights activists have been sounding the alarm for decades, and it's time we listen. The tricks and stunts we marvel at are, in fact, a form of mockery and torture. The exploitation of animals in circuses is a blatant violation of their rights and goes against the principles of humane treatment.\n\nSince the 1970s, many countries have been working to establish laws that protect animals and guarantee their basic rights. International agreements have recognized animals as sentient beings, deserving of respect and protection. Yet, the cruel reality persists.\n\nThe tricks we see are not natural behaviors for these wild creatures. They are taught through punishment, deprivation, and manipulation. The phrase \"animal performers\" may evoke romantic notions, but the harsh truth is that these animals are not actors by choice. They are prisoners, forced to perform for our amusement, stripped of their freedom and natural instincts.\n\nThe circus experience is a life sentence of loneliness, confinement, and suffering. Animals are locked in cramped cages, unable to stand up or turn around, for 95% of their lives. They are at the mercy of humans, who use force and cunning to control them.\n\nIt's time for us to take a stand. We must introduce restrictions on the exploitation of animals in circuses and recognize their fundamental right to follow their instincts and live in their natural habitats. By refusing to support performances built on violence and cruelty, we can make a difference.\n\nThe next time you're tempted to buy a ticket to the circus, remember the unspoken truth behind the big top. Let's choose compassion over cruelty and give animals the respect and freedom they deserve.",
    "The Commitment to Health Theory is a model that determines stages of development and behavior change towards a healthy lifestyle. It assumes an internal desire for health, despite limiting circumstances, and ignores differences like gender and race. The theory uses principles from the Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change, including stages of change, decisive balance, and self-efficacy. In advanced nursing practice, this theory can be used to measure patient indicators, set goals, and track behavior change. The three stages of the theory involve instilling confidence, applying strategies to strengthen desire, and introducing behavioral patterns for a healthy lifestyle. Healthcare professionals can use this theory to personalize therapy and employ motivating communication techniques.",
    "In the pursuit of excellence in medical education, many students focus on acquiring extensive theoretical and practical knowledge. While this approach is essential, I've come to realize that it's only half the story. The true key to success in healthcare lies in a doctor's ability to forge strong relationships with their patients. This epiphany struck me when I observed Dr. Wang, a seasoned eye surgeon, in action. What struck me was not just Dr. Wang's technical expertise, but their remarkable ability to connect with patients on a personal level.\n\nAs I analyzed Dr. Wang's behavior, I identified three essential skills that enabled them to build trust with their patients. Firstly, they were an active listener, encouraging patients to share their concerns and feelings without interruption. Secondly, Dr. Wang maintained a polite and patient demeanor, regardless of their mood. Finally, they showed genuine interest in their patients' lives, often inquiring about their well-being and personal stories.\n\nOne particular instance that stood out was when Dr. Wang asked a patient about her daughter's health, recalling a previous conversation. This kind of empathy and interest helped patients feel comfortable opening up about their problems, which in turn allowed Dr. Wang to provide more accurate and effective treatment.\n\nWitnessing the transformative power of trustful relationships in healthcare has inspired me to develop my own communication skills. I hope that by sharing Dr. Wang's exemplary practice, I can inspire fellow medical professionals to prioritize building strong bonds with their patients. By doing so, we can revolutionize the way we deliver healthcare and make a more meaningful impact on people's lives.",
    "The availability of healthy food options is a significant social factor that influences grocery purchases. To better understand this issue, I conducted research at Wal-Mart in Forest Park, gathering data on the products available and their prices. The prices of staple items were as follows: one gallon of Great Value milk costs $2.65, one loaf of Sara Lee bread costs $2.44, one bag of Gala apples costs $3.58, and one bag of organic baby carrots costs $3.88. Additionally, I found that one yogurt container costs $1.92, a 2-liter of Pepsi Soda costs $1.98, one bag of chips costs $2.84, and a family-size pack of cookies costs $3.98.\n\nThe community of Maywood, IL 60153, where I conducted my research, has a predominantly African American population (68.6%), with significant white (18.2%) and Hispanic/Latino (26.9%) populations as well (United States Census Bureau, n.d.). Unfortunately, this area lacks access to good grocery stores, but has seen a significant increase in fast-food restaurants in recent years. This limited access to healthy food options contributes to health problems such as hypertension and diabetes among residents.\n\nAnother critical social factor affecting human health and shopping habits is the lack of transportation and the inability of the working class to regularly visit grocery stores like Wal-Mart. The median household income in this region is approximately $50,176, with a poverty level of around 15% (United States Census Bureau, n.d.). This means that many individuals are unable to access stores with healthy food options, forcing them to make unhealthy choices that compromise their health.\n\nThe combination of transportation, income, and food factors has a profound impact on public health (Islam, 2019). It is essential to not only identify these problems but also to develop solutions to address them and improve the health of the population. As a community health nurse (CHN), it is crucial to promote public health and implement interventions to address food security. According to Schffer and Strohschein (2019), 17 interventions have been introduced, categorized into five groups with different colors, which provide a unique opportunity for community members to collaborate and promote health. The key characteristics of these interventions include a high level of commitment, partnership, and goal orientation (Schffer & Strohschein, 2019). By collaborating at the systems level, CHNs can engage with all relevant stakeholders, analyze the current state of affairs through community collaboration, and improve personal knowledge and engagement through cooperation with families.",
    "The computer is one of the most significant inventions in human history. It's hard to imagine a modern home or office without one. While some argue that computers have made life more complex and stressful, I believe they have enriched our society with numerous advantages, primarily due to faster communication and easier access to information.\n\nOne of the primary benefits of computers is their ability to facilitate fast and efficient communication. In today's globalized society, computers play a vital role in communication systems. Previously, communication was limited to traditional means like mail, which often resulted in significant delays. For instance, a businessman traveling abroad would face considerable delays in sending reports, which was unacceptable in a competitive business environment. The Internet has revolutionized communication, enabling businesses to send messages instantly. Staff can now send emails or instant messages to managers anywhere in the world, adding efficiency to businesses and expanding opportunities.\n\nPersonally, I find computers to be a technological necessity that makes my life more enjoyable and interesting. They are an excellent leisure tool, allowing me to watch movies and TV shows conveniently and comfortably. Moreover, my daily work, which is my primary source of income, relies heavily on computers, making them not only a means of entertainment but also a tool for earning a living.\n\nComputers have also transformed the healthcare industry. Physicians and healthcare workers use computers for various essential purposes, including diagnosis, conducting examinations, and preventive care. Computer hardware is widely used in medical imaging, such as computed tomography and nuclear medical diagnostics, which provide accurate images of internal organ structures. Ultrasound diagnostics and probing have opened up countless possibilities for obtaining images of internal organs and studying their condition. With computer intervention, diagnostic and treatment methods have become much easier and more effective.",
    "In the context of building construction, a Code of Practice is a comprehensive set of standards, procedures, and regulations that contractors and developers are expected to adhere to in order to mitigate potential environmental consequences arising from construction activities. For large-scale clients, local authorities, and public entities, this code is applied to new developments, outlining specific requirements related to the environmental impact of construction. Its primary objective is to provide guidance within the framework of legal, administrative, and technical systems to ensure the protection of workers, the environment, and the public, as well as to exercise control over major hazard installations. According to the code, the strategic separation of large population centers, including residential areas, commercial establishments, educational institutions, and healthcare facilities, from major hazard installations, coupled with the development of appropriate emergency response plans, serves to prevent major accidents at these installations. The Code of Practice is applicable to major hazard installations identified based on a list of hazardous substances associated with threshold quantities, which warrant priority attention due to their potential to cause severe incidents with detrimental environmental and human impacts. Examples of major hazard installations include oil refineries, petrochemical and chemical plants, storage facilities for flammable liquids, gas, and liquefied petroleum gas, fertilizer plants, chemical warehouses, and water treatment facilities utilizing chlorine. Notably, nuclear hazards, military-related hazards, and the transportation of potentially hazardous chemicals are excluded from the code, as they are subject to distinct control and management protocols. In general, the code outlines a range of activities that competent authorities should undertake to establish effective major hazard control systems, thereby preventing incidents. Competent authorities encompass government inspectorates and safety authorities, law enforcement agencies, local authorities, workers and their representatives, management personnel, fire and health authorities, suppliers of major hazard technologies, and other relevant organizations.",
    "The debate surrounding Confederate statues has sparked intense discussions in modern times. While former President Donald Trump's political agenda advocates for their preservation as historical symbols of the United States, a growing body of evidence suggests that these monuments perpetuate racial disparities and White supremacy. A closer examination of the timeline reveals that most of these statues were erected during the early 20th century, coinciding with the enactment of discriminatory laws against African Americans. The United Daughters of the Confederacy sponsored the construction of these monuments, which were strategically placed to reinforce White dominance and social inequalities.\n\nThe connection between these statues and systemic racism is undeniable, particularly during the second wave of monument construction in the 1920-1940s, which coincided with the Civil Rights Movement and widespread lynchings in the South. The placement of these statues, often on courthouse grounds, served as a symbol of legal protection for Whites. In recent years, the removal or relocation of these monuments has been a necessary response to the ongoing discrimination against African Americans.\n\nPersonally, it's impossible to ignore the direct link between Confederate statues and the perpetuation of White supremacy. While some statues may be removed, it's essential to remember that human history is complex and multifaceted. Rather than erasing the past, we should acknowledge and learn from our mistakes to avoid repeating them in the future.",
    "Conflict in the workplace: it's a ticking time bomb that can detonate at any moment, causing chaos and destruction in its wake. And nowhere is this more critical than in healthcare facilities, where the stakes are high and the pressure is intense. As McKibben (2017) so astutely puts it, conflict is an inevitable part of human interaction, especially when you throw in the complexities of physical, mental, and ethical demands found in hospitals.\n\nBut what happens when conflicts are left to simmer and boil over? The consequences are dire: decreased performance, plummeting employee satisfaction, and - worst of all - a negative impact on patient care (Suifan, Alhyari, & Sweis, 2020). It's a vicious cycle that can only be broken by tackling conflicts head-on and resolving them quickly.\n\nSo, what sparks these conflicts in the first place? To manage them effectively, we need to understand the root causes. And it turns out that these causes can be grouped into three main categories: individual, interpersonal, and organizational.\n\nOn an individual level, it's all about personal traits and characteristics. Research shows that self-esteem, emotional intelligence, and communication styles can all play a role in determining how often and how severely conflicts arise (Kim et al., 2017). Even factors like age, experience, and license level can influence behavior during conflict situations (Chang, Chen, & Chen, 2017).\n\nBut conflicts can also be sparked by interpersonal issues, such as a lack of trust and respect, power struggles, and ineffective communication (Kim et al., 2017). And then there are organizational conflicts, which stem from structural and work arrangement issues, like ambiguous responsibilities and inadequate hierarchies (Kim et al., 2017; McKibben, 2017). These conflicts are often a result of poor management decisions, and can lead to widespread dissatisfaction and disputes.\n\nI've seen these factors play out in my own life, too. I have a friend who's self-focused and often fails to consider others' opinions, leading to conflicts when I get tired of compromising. I've also struggled with controlling my emotions, which has led to conflicts with my parents, friends, and even classmates. And who can forget the time we failed to discuss responsibilities on a team project, leading to a full-blown conflict?\n\nThe takeaway is clear: conflicts are complex, multifaceted, and can arise from a variety of sources. But by understanding these sources, we can take the first step towards resolving them - and creating a more harmonious, effective, and patient-centric workplace.",
    "In the realm of philosophy, certain archetypes embody the pinnacle of human excellence, inspiring us to live a life of purpose and virtue. In Confucianism, the junzi - a paragon of nobility and gentility - is the epitome of human aspiration (Yu-kit 223). This idealized figure possesses a unique blend of qualities that make them a shining example of moral excellence, a beacon of hope in a world fraught with imperfections. This essay delves into the essence of the Confucian gentleman, juxtaposing it with Plato's philosopher-king, two archetypes that have captivated human imagination for centuries.\n\nIn traditional Chinese culture, the Confucian gentleman is revered as a champion of virtue, who rises above the fray of evil influences, recognizes their insidious effects, and counters them with unwavering resolve (Yu-kit 225). Moreover, this paragon of virtue empowers others to do the same, imparting knowledge and wisdom to those around them (Yu-kit 223). As Yu-kit so eloquently puts it, the noble person must assume a dual role of \"exemplar and educator\" (224), embodying virtues that become second nature to them. Their daily existence is a testament to the highest moral standards, inspiring others to strive for similar greatness.\n\nPlato's philosopher-king shares striking similarities with this archetypal figure, both exemplifying positive moral qualities while addressing negative ones through the power of reason and rationality. This stoic leader is driven by an insatiable thirst for wisdom, seeking to better society through their unwavering pursuit of knowledge (Mark). While both archetypes are committed to upholding moral values, Plato's philosopher-king is more focused on education, whereas the Confucian gentleman is a living embodiment of moral excellence.\n\nUltimately, both roles converge on a shared vision of a noble person, defined by qualities such as kindness, fairness, selflessness, and a quest for harmony. However, Plato's ideal person is a stoic leader who prioritizes wisdom above all else, whereas the Confucian gentleman is a champion of moral values, inspiring others to follow in their footsteps. Through their selfless acts of kindness, both archetypes uplift the personal values of those around them, leaving an indelible mark on humanity.",
    "Get ready to unleash innovation! Corporate entrepreneurship is the dynamic process where teams within an existing corporation create, nurture, promote, and manage a brand-new business that's distinct from the parent organization. But here's the twist - these new entities leverage the parent's strengths, competitive edge, knowledge, and capabilities to drive growth. It's a bold approach that combines meticulous planning with unconventional thinking, and it's paying off for industry giants like Amazon and Samsung.\n\nThese trailblazers aren't resting on their laurels; they're proactively driving innovation to stay ahead of the curve. Take Amazon Custom, for instance - a game-changing initiative that lets suppliers offer customized products on Amazon for the first time, with features like custom text and more. Or consider Samsung's innovative strategy, which empowers a 'creative elite' to drive new projects and maximize KPIs using open innovation and corporate technical reconnaissance.\n\nNew product advocates are encouraged to think outside the box, exploring ideas for new merchandise through independent strategic orientation. The iPod is a shining example of this approach, built with the help of Apple's talented engineers and staff. And then there's inspired strategic behavior, a top-down process that leverages the company's existing hierarchical structure to drive innovation - just like the iPhone.\n\nThe most likely outcome? Induced business strategy that drives growth and success. But what really sets this approach apart is its focus on human effort and creativity. It's about empowering individuals to bring new ideas, products, and procedures to the table, becoming experts in their field and driving innovation from within. The result? A culture of creativity and innovation that propels businesses forward!",
    "The inevitability of the Second World War is a notion shared by people today and those who lived through the 1930s. While some argue that the United States could have prevented the war's outbreak, this seems unlikely due to several factors. \n\nDuring the 1930s, the American government pursued an isolationist foreign policy, focusing on domestic issues such as the economic crisis (Corbett et al., 2021) and the growing threat of communist ideology (Russett, 2019). The country's relatively limited economic power at the time meant it had little influence on European affairs. \n\nMoreover, the war was a result of the clash between European nations, and the outcomes of the Treaty of Versailles had laid the groundwork for a new conflict. Germany had begun to rebuild its resources and form alliances with other dictatorships, making it impossible for any single country to prevent the war. The emergence of regimes like the communist USSR, Nazi Germany, and fascist Italy made a new military conflict, and eventually a world war, almost inevitable. \n\nTherefore, it is unlikely that the USA could have prevented the start of the Second World War, even if it had abandoned its isolationist foreign policy. However, the country played a crucial role in ending the war and establishing a new world order.",
    "In this paper, I'll be diving into the article \"COVID-19: Impact on Nurses and Nursing\" by Fauteux (2021). The abstract is supposed to be a quick intro to the article, but in this case, it's pretty brief and doesn't give us much to go on. It doesn't mention the research methods or results, so it's not super helpful.\n\nThe introduction, on the other hand, is way more detailed. It gives us a good overview of how the pandemic has affected nursing, with some stats to back it up. I learned that COVID-19 has led to higher mortality rates, changes in how nurses work, and a heavier workload. This intro does a great job of setting the stage for the rest of the article.\n\nThe research method used in this article is qualitative, which means it's based on a review of existing research. The study looks at the big picture and draws some conclusions about how nursing has changed. It uses data that's already been analyzed to give us an overview of what's going on. The main takeaway is that nursing has undergone some major changes, including more collaboration and innovation, fewer barriers to practice, and a big push for telemedicine. Oh, and there's a higher risk of burnout for nurses, which is no surprise given their workload.\n\nWhat really caught my attention was the increased risk of burnout and how telemedicine has become way more popular since the pandemic. It's crazy how much the pandemic has changed people's attitudes towards their health! This article is super helpful for understanding how an entire field of medicine can change in extreme circumstances.",
    "From the earliest days, law enforcement has been driven by a singular mission: to protect citizens from harm, preserve their well-being, and shield them from the chaos of civil unrest and crime. As Harris (2020) reveals, law enforcement agencies have been entrusted with the authority to wield force, make arrests, and maintain order, all backed by the government's seal of approval. In its most primitive form, law enforcement was a collective effort, with clan members banding together to enforce group rules and keep rogue elements in check. The ultimate goal was to safeguard the community from internal threats, with the understanding that any violence against one was a threat to all (Harris, 2020).\n\nTo achieve this mission, early law enforcement relied on three core principles. First, coercion was not an option. Second, law enforcement officers took on a diverse range of tasks. And third, a critical distinction was made between those who held policing powers and those who carried out policing duties. Peace officers, in particular, were bound by a sacred oath to uphold the law, both on and off duty. In the United States, for example, they were obligated to respect local and state jurisdictions, refraining from committing crimes and upholding the rule of law in areas like detention, arrests, evidence preservation, and informant management (Schroeder & Lombardo, 2018). Moreover, peace officers were duty-bound to respect individual freedoms, never exceeding their authority or restricting liberties without just cause. The only exception was when the law itself permitted deviations from standard criminal procedures.",
    "The devastating phenomenon of slavery has had a profound impact on the lives of people of African descent throughout history. To fully understand this complex issue, it's essential to explore the origins of racism and slavery. In \"The Origin of Negro Slavery,\" Williams reveals that although slavery is now deeply associated with the exploitation of African Americans, it initially involved populations of various races and ethnicities (Williams 7). In fact, racism emerged as a consequence of forced labor, rather than being originally connected to the targeted discrimination of African Americans.\n\nThe history of slavery shows that the first population to undergo the brutal process of enslavement was the Indians. Spanish explorers, for instance, used Indian labor in their colonies to convert them to Christianity, forcing those who refused to accept the faith into slavery (Williams 8). Similarly, Great Britain and France supported slavery in their colonial territories, but this was not driven by racial prejudices. Instead, it was a means of punishing indigenous communities. However, over time, enslaved Africans became a highly valuable asset in the slave trade due to their economic benefits, leading to the establishment of Negro slavery as a norm (Williams 21).\n\nAs a result, racism and racial discrimination emerged, but the initial reason for replacing other enslaved groups with African Americans was economic, not racial. In conclusion, the connection between slavery and racism lies in the fact that racial biases towards African Americans were caused by their widespread use as enslaved people. Slavery did not arise from racism; rather, individuals from diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds were involved in the slave trade. However, once the economic benefits of using enslaved Africans were established, negative racial stereotypes began to emerge, ultimately leading to the development of racism.",
    "So, what is culture, exactly? It's the sum of all the social norms, behaviors, and customs that set one society apart from the rest. And, as you'd expect, some cultures have more in common with each other than others, forming what we call cultural clusters. But here's the thing: leadership is a personality trait that can be found in people from all over the world, regardless of their cultural background. That being said, cultural norms can definitely influence how leaders behave.\n\nTake time, for example. People from different cultural clusters view it in vastly different ways. In the Middle East, there's a strong emphasis on tradition and the past, whereas in the West, particularly in America, people tend to focus on the future and embracing change. Just think of Barack Obama, who rose to prominence by promising change. But that's not the only difference in leadership behaviors. Researchers have found that cultural differences can affect how leaders approach transformational leadership, too.\n\nOne study, for instance, discovered that in cultures with more traditional values, leaders are more likely to succeed in driving change. This might seem counterintuitive, but it makes sense when you think about it. In more traditional societies, leaders are often seen as authority figures, and their words carry more weight. So, it's clear that culture plays a significant role in shaping leadership behaviors. In fact, I'd argue that our definition of culture should include its impact on leadership. After all, culture doesn't just define a social group - it also influences the people who make the biggest decisions in society.",
    "Culture is a pervasive and influential force that shapes every aspect of human life. It affects how people behave, think, and interact with one another, and is a crucial component of the context in which all activities take place. According to Roseberry, culture is a socially constructed and socially constitutive element that is intertwined with other fundamental institutions and phenomena, such as power, economy, and history. As a way of life, culture influences these spheres and lays the groundwork for critical processes to emerge. In turn, cultural peculiarities shape decision-making in political and historical contexts, and inform approaches to business and economy. By understanding history and politics, we can gain insight into the complex and multifaceted nature of culture. Moreover, Roseberry suggests that culture is socially constituted, meaning that different cultures share common values and visions. While my own culture may share similarities with that of my friends and community, it differs significantly from cultures in other regions. This is due to the social nature of culture, which encompasses diverse perspectives and attitudes that shape people's mentalities and worldviews. Ultimately, culture is a social construct that profoundly influences social interactions and the institutions that govern our daily lives.",
    "The process of state formation is inherently complex, involving a multitude of intricate processes, prominently featuring cultural strategies of power. It is widely acknowledged that the actions of social agents play a pivotal role in this context, occupying a central position in the formation of alliances and the establishment of dominance relations. A comprehensive understanding of this concept is essential for grasping the emergence of Western Europe, China, the Islamic World, and India. \n\nTo begin with, it is imperative to define and elucidate the significance of social strategies of power. These strategies constitute a specific domain of practice where mass media creators wield cultural influence and function as agents of social change. Consequently, these sources shape and influence public opinion, which, in turn, affects the formation of states. \n\nGledhill's seminal work highlights the fundamental distinction between state and stateless societies, attributing it to the centralization and decentralization of power. The absence of centralization is characterized by inequality, whereas the absence of citizenship is associated with decentralization, and conversely, equality is linked to centralization. \n\nIn conclusion, to fully comprehend the emergence of states in Western Europe, China, the Islamic World, and India, it is essential to consider the cultural strategy of power. The author deliberately diverges from the conventional European perspectives on the role of social anthropology and factors in Chapter 3, emphasizing the significance of social influence alongside other political and economic factors. Social agents play a crucial role in shaping public opinion, thereby contributing to the formation of states. This underscores the intrinsic relationship between the creation of states in Europe, China, the Islamic World, and India and the social strategies of power.",
    "The evolution of personal computers has been fueled by the development of increasingly sophisticated hardware and software. At the heart of this transformation are buses, the communication highways that enable seamless interaction between internal components and peripheral devices. There are three primary types of buses: address, control, and data buses (Farret et al., 2017). The data bus, responsible for exchanging data between the Central Processing Unit (CPU) and peripherals, has undergone a significant transformation. With five types of data buses - 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 - the capacity for simultaneous data transfer has increased exponentially (Farret et al., 2017). The number of parallel lines in a processor determines the number of electrical signals that can be exchanged, with 32-bit and 64-bit microprocessors being the most common operating systems in modern computers. The difference between these two types of data buses is stark: a 64-bit data bus can process information at twice the speed of a 32-bit data bus, thanks to its 64 parallel lines (Farret et al., 2017). The pace of data transfer in older versions is similarly dependent on the number of parallel copper wires between the CPU and internal parts. While all buses share the common function of data interchange, their structural differences result in vastly different processing speeds. The implications are clear: as buses continue to evolve, they will play an increasingly critical role in shaping the future of computing.",
    "Data science is a field that explores the entire lifecycle of digital data, from its creation to its application in various areas of knowledge. It involves examining large amounts of information to achieve practical results. However, Os Keyes offers a contrasting perspective, suggesting that data science reduces humanity to mere quantifiable data. This view implies that everything in life can be measured and quantified, and that data science systems aim to absorb and quantify all aspects of human life. Furthermore, these systems often eliminate human judgment in decision-making, leading to inhumane outcomes. Standardized tests, for instance, rely on algorithms that don't allow for personal opinions or mistakes, instead demanding correct answers. This can lead to a culture of fear, where individuals are hesitant to express themselves freely. On the other hand, data science is crucial in fields like healthcare, where mistakes can have serious consequences. Electronic systems can help healthcare professionals choose the right treatment and dosage, reducing medication errors caused by human factors, such as forgetting to check expiration dates.",
    "Gerai's account of the Dayak community's views on sex and gender is surprisingly utopian. Unlike Western societies, which often pit men and women against each other, the Dayak recognize and celebrate their differences. They empower both genders based on their unique characteristics, such as male strength and female persistence, and bring them together to create a harmonious and nearly egalitarian society.\n\nIn contrast, many industrialized societies perpetuate severe gender clashes, associating male strength with aggression and femininity with passivity. This is because Western society values hypermasculinity and aggression as defining characteristics of men, leading to a culture that condones sexual domination, assault, and rape.\n\nRape is often attributed to natural biology, but it's actually a reflection of societal values. The Dayak's perspective highlights both the natural characteristics of genders and their social features. In our society, certain connotations and stereotypes are associated with sexual violence, such as the feminization of victims and the masculinization of perpetrators. For example, a UK study found that victims of rape are often associated with passive femininity, while perpetrators are seen as embodying prescriptive masculinity.\n\nOverall, the Dayak's approach to gender and sex is a refreshing alternative to the harmful gender norms that perpetuate sexual violence in many societies.",
    "When blood clots form in the veins of your lower legs, they can cause big problems. These clots can block the normal flow of blood and even break loose, traveling to your heart, lungs, and other organs (Dalen, 2016). The bad news is that it's often hard to catch the early signs of this condition, known as thrombosis. But if you notice your skin changing color or swelling up where the clot is, that's a red flag. As the condition gets worse, you might feel sharp pain and heaviness in your legs. This is because the clot is causing a traffic jam in your veins.\n\nSo, what causes thrombosis? Usually, it's a combo of blood clotting and damage to the vein walls (Thachil & Bagot, 2018). Long trips, getting older, and taking certain meds can also increase your risk. To figure out what's going on, your doc might use a few different tests like duplex scanning, radiopaque phlebography, MRI, or CT. These tests will help them get a clear picture of what's happening and come up with a treatment plan.\n\nTreatment might involve meds like heparin or anticoagulants to thin out your blood. If that doesn't work, they might need to try thrombolysis to break down the clot. In severe cases, surgery might be necessary, but that's usually a last resort. The goal is to avoid surgery and use other methods to get you better. By doing so, you'll not only cure the thrombosis but also save your life!",
    "For centuries, Western scholars have distorted African culture, viewing it through the lens of colonization. As a result, African philosophy has been altered and turned into a commodity. Scholars like p'Bitek and Marimba argue that Western ideology has misrepresented African culture, spirituality, and philosophy, disrupting African people's ability to define themselves.\n\nIn African culture, there is no clear distinction between culture, philosophy, and spirituality. However, European culture has imposed its own views, turning aspects of life into objects for observation and sale. This has led to younger generations of Africans seeing their culture as a collection of souvenirs rather than a part of everyday life.\n\nAfrican-Americans, in particular, feel disconnected from traditional African society and struggle to identify with European culture. This disconnection leads to a loss of communal and generational identity.\n\nThe clash between African and European ideologies has resulted in the distortion of African culture, with Western views dominating its presentation. As a result, generations of people have lost touch with their culture, seeing it through the distorted lens of commodification. African culture is inherently linked to philosophy, spirituality, and living in the moment, but it has been turned into a tourist attraction, forcing its people to view it through the eyes of foreigners and losing their connection to history and nature.",
    "Imagine a world where progress for one racial group is seen as a threat to another. This is the toxic \"zero-sum story\" that has dominated conservative media for years, perpetuating a false narrative that pits racial groups against each other in a battle for limited resources. The consequences of this mindset are devastating, with far-reaching economic, political, and social costs that affect every citizen in the United States.\n\nHeather McGhee's work masterfully exposes the destructive power of this paradigm. Take, for example, the history of public swimming pools in US cities. In the early 20th century, these pools were a staple of urban life, but they were often reserved for whites only. When cities were forced to integrate these facilities, white residents pushed back, and rather than share the pools with people of color, cities opted to close or privatize them instead. This is a stark example of how the \"zero-sum\" mindset can lead to the destruction of public goods, driving up costs for everyone.\n\nBut that's not all. McGhee also reveals how this toxic narrative has derailed social progress. When the Black community began advocating for job and social benefits, many white people suddenly lost interest in these policies, fearing that others would benefit from them. The result? Less social justice and fewer benefits for the entire country. McGhee's arguments are compelling and well-supported by facts and statistics. It's hard to deny that racism has created significant social and economic problems in the United States. By shedding light on the \"zero-sum\" story, McGhee offers a powerful indictment of a system that has held us back for far too long.",
    "Type 1 diabetes typically develops when the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys the pancreatic beta cells in individuals who are genetically prone to the disease. This damage occurs gradually over months or years, leading to insulin deficiency. As a result, the body cannot process glucose in muscles and fat tissues, triggering the release of hormones that counteract insulin's effects. These hormones, particularly glucagon, stimulate the liver to produce more glucose, leading to high blood sugar levels and metabolic acidosis. \n\nIn contrast, type 2 diabetes is the most common endocrine disorder, and it develops due to insulin resistance, where cells become less responsive to insulin's effects. This leads to the inability of insulin-dependent tissues to absorb glucose from the blood and disrupts glycogen synthesis in the liver. \n\nTo manage diabetes, patients should follow a structured diet and take medications with meals. For type 1 diabetes, a recommended diet includes complex carbohydrates from fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and skim milk. For type 2 diabetes, the diet should include complex carbohydrates like brown rice, whole wheat, fruits, vegetables, and beans. In both cases, simple carbohydrates like sugar, pasta, and white bread should be avoided. \n\nFor type 1 diabetes, insulin therapy, such as Insulin Degludec (Tresiba), is necessary, along with diet. This medication is suitable for patients over 18 years old and can help prevent hypoglycemia. Additionally, Zynquista, an oral medication, can be combined with insulin. For type 2 diabetes, insulin therapy may be required if diet, exercise, and anti-diabetic medications are not effective in controlling blood sugar levels. In this case, Insulin Degludec or Metformin, an oral medication, may be prescribed.",
    "In the healthcare industry, patient education is a top priority, especially when it comes to minority groups. A groundbreaking study by McCurley et al. (2017) sheds light on a crucial aspect of diabetes prevention among Hispanic individuals. The researchers discovered that personalized, face-to-face sessions - both one-on-one and in groups - yield remarkable results. But what drives these positive outcomes? I believe it's because patients have the opportunity to ask questions, clarify doubts, and realize they're not alone in their health struggles. This sense of community and understanding can boost morale, motivating individuals to take proactive steps towards their health.\n\nThis insight has significant implications for my practicum project, which aims to improve access to care for African Americans living with heart failure. However, it's essential to consider the broader context and not solely focus on cultural backgrounds. The findings of Cajiita et al. (2017) are particularly noteworthy, as they demonstrate how mobile technology (mHealth) can be a powerful tool in promoting better health knowledge. In their study of 129 older adults, including nearly 25% African Americans, they found that mHealth can lead to improved care. With modern individuals spending an increasing amount of time online, it's logical to leverage mHealth opportunities to enhance access to care for African Americans.\n\nUltimately, I propose that combining the benefits of mobile technology with face-to-face educational sessions could lead to the most optimal outcomes. By harnessing the strengths of both approaches, we can create a more comprehensive and effective strategy for improving healthcare access and outcomes.",
    "Want to stay healthy and avoid getting sick with heart disease, cancer, and diabetes? It's easier than you think! You just need to make some simple changes to what you eat.\n\nFirst, let's talk about what NOT to eat. Try to avoid foods with added sugars, too much salt, and bad fats like saturated and trans fats. These can be found in foods like candy, chips, and processed meats.\n\nNow, let's talk about what TO eat! You should try to eat more whole grains like brown rice and whole wheat bread, as well as lots of fruits and veggies. Dark green and orange veggies like broccoli and carrots are super good for you, and so are nuts and seeds. You can also eat lean meats like chicken and fish.\n\nIf you want to prevent heart disease, make sure to eat foods that are low in fat and salt. If you want to prevent cancer, try to eat more fruits and veggies, and avoid red meat. And if you want to prevent diabetes, eat more non-starchy veggies like broccoli and cauliflower, and choose foods that are high in protein like beans and lentils.\n\nThe good news is that all of these recommendations are pretty similar, so you can follow the same healthy eating plan to prevent all three conditions! Just remember to eat a balanced diet with plenty of fruits, veggies, and whole grains, and try to avoid foods that are high in sugar, salt, and bad fats.",
    "While often used interchangeably, \"business\" and \"economics\" have distinct differences despite their similarities. Both deal with creating and selling products and services, and share subtopics like marketing and finance. They're social sciences that focus on financial measurement, analysis, and projections. However, their purposes differ. Economics studies human behavior and its impact on national economies, while business focuses on the exchange of goods and money, from production to sale. Economics deals with broad theories like supply and demand, interest rates, and international trade, aiming to maximize societal welfare. Business, on the other hand, focuses on wealth creation, applying practical theories to benefit shareholders. The two fields address different issues, with economics tackling poverty and taxation, and business focusing on product positioning and profitability. Despite their similarities, business and economics are distinct sciences with different conceptual and practical approaches.",
    "Have you ever wondered how doctors and nurses approach patient care differently? This topic is fascinating because it highlights the unique strengths of each profession. When we compare medical and nursing practices, we see that doctors focus on a patient's physical health, while nurses consider both physical and emotional well-being. This difference in approach is especially clear when we look at how they use research to inform their decisions.\n\nDoctors tend to rely on objective data and facts, which leads to quantitative research. On the other hand, nurses use a combination of data and personal opinions, which is known as mixed research. This difference in approach affects how they diagnose and treat patients.\n\nOne key area where this difference is important is in using lab results versus symptoms to diagnose patients. By comparing these two approaches, we can see which one leads to more accurate results. This research can also help us understand the importance of personalized care in nursing.\n\nIn fact, decision-making is a critical part of nursing care. By studying how nurses make decisions, we can improve patient outcomes and prevent injuries. For example, we could explore how nurses can prevent falls in hospitals, rather than just treating them after they happen. This kind of research can help us provide better, more personalized care to patients.",

    "In a landmark case that shook the foundations of workplace equality, Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S., paved the way for a discrimination-free work environment. At the heart of this pivotal case was the quest for diversity, with a special focus on sex and age - a potent combination that often sparks concern among the masses (King, 2021).\n\nThe story of Gerald Bostock, a man with an impeccable work record, served as a beacon of hope for fair employment practices. His unjust termination from a company he had served with distinction was a stark reminder of the dark underbelly of workplace bias. The trigger? His open enthusiasm for a gay softball league, which he shared with colleagues, unwittingly violating the provisions of Title VII (Mallory et al., 2020).\n\nBostock's courageous legal battle, fueled by the Civil Rights Act, initially hit a roadblock when the district court dismissed his claim. But he refused to back down, citing Massachusetts law, Chapter 151B, to bolster his argument (\"Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S.,\" 2019). The appeal was a resounding success, and the court's verdict sent a powerful message: sexual discrimination would no longer be tolerated in the workplace.\n\nThis watershed moment marked a significant shift in the interpretation of employment law, plugging a critical gap in the provisions of Title VII. For the first time, the law explicitly recognized the importance of protecting workers from discrimination based on sex and age. The ripple effect of this decision was profound, ensuring that diversity in the workplace was not only celebrated but also safeguarded by law. In the end, Bostock's bravery inspired a sea change in the way we approach workplace equality, paving the way for a more inclusive and just work environment for all.",

    "**Geographical Distribution and Location of Bananas**\n\nBananas are a popular fruit crop grown worldwide, offering several health benefits. They play a significant role in low-income, food-insecure, and least developed countries, where they contribute to both household food security and revenue generation as a cash crop.\n\n**Global Production and Trade**\n\nBananas are the largest fruit crop in Africa, Asia, and Latin America in terms of production and commerce. Over 90% of banana exports come from Central and South America, as well as the Philippines. The top importers are the EU, the USA, China, Russia, and Japan. Global banana production is projected to reach 130 million tons per year.\n\n**Consumption Patterns**\n\nApproximately 87% of bananas produced worldwide are consumed by farmers or sold in local markets. Sub-Saharan Africa accounts for almost a third of global banana production, meeting over 25% of the dietary energy requirements of over 100 million people. East Africa is the largest producer and consumer of bananas in Africa.\n\n**Spatial Distribution and Trade Dynamics**\n\nThe growth of banana exports from top exporting countries like Ecuador and the Philippines, combined with increasing import demand from China and the European Union, drives the trade. Large retail chains from key importing nations are now operating directly in the global banana value chain, buying bananas directly from growers and distributors. However, this complex web of interactions can lead to conflicts of interest among groups over who benefits the most from the product.\n\n**Challenges in Spatial Distribution**\n\nCheap bananas are often passed on to small farmers and plantation workers down the supply chain, resulting in lower wages and working conditions. The main issue in terms of spatial distribution is that large-scale banana production can negatively impact the environment, worker health and safety, and local populations due to the harsh techniques employed to regulate irrigation and plant diseases.\n\n**Source**\n\nMacKinnon, D., & Cumbers, A.

    "To Ensure Budgetary Control Effectiveness, a Strong Organizational Framework is Essential\n\nA robust organizational structure is vital for effective budgetary control. This includes establishing permanent positions such as a finance committee and a budget director to oversee budget planning and implementation. To prevent bottlenecks, budget planning must be well-integrated, and individual budgets should be harmonized to ensure a cohesive approach. Regular budget reviews are also crucial to prevent overspending and ensure that resources are allocated judiciously.\n\nAs Dauda (2019) notes, \"all types of business organizations must engage in financial planning to ensure the effective deployment of resources in achieving organizational goals.\" Furthermore, employees should be fairly compensated based on their performance, and underperforming staff should be addressed accordingly.\n\nThe Human Aspect of Budgetary Control\n\nBudgetary control is a critical tool for performance evaluation, but it requires time to yield results. Those responsible for fiscal control must possess extensive knowledge and expertise in the field. As financial considerations influence employees' work practices, routines, and relationships, they may resist changes. Therefore, it is essential to create budgets with top leadership support, clearly defining and communicating each employee's roles and responsibilities. This awareness of their power and responsibilities is vital for effective budgetary management.\n\nUltimately, the success of a financial management program depends on the organization's well-defined objectives. Management should exercise caution when setting targets, ensuring they are explicit and aligned with the organization's goals.",
    "The notion that women are naturally more caring and nurturing is a harmful stereotype that has been perpetuated through gendered behavior and socialization. From a young age, I was taught that women are the primary caregivers in the home, and that they possess a unique ability to empathize and alleviate suffering. This idea was reinforced by the media, which often depicted women as warm, nurturing, and selfless. However, this stereotype has severe consequences, limiting women's career opportunities and restricting them to certain professions like nursing and teaching.\n\nThe assumption that women are more caring and nurturing has led to the belief that they are unfit for certain jobs, such as piloting, engineering, and medicine, which are often better paying and more prestigious. This has resulted in women being funneled into lower-paying careers, perpetuating gender-based discrimination. Furthermore, this stereotype has led to the assumption that women are naturally suited to caregiving roles, such as nursing, rather than leadership positions, like doctors.\n\nIn reality, this stereotype is not only damaging to women's career prospects but also reinforces harmful gender norms. It implies that women are inherently more emotional and less capable of handling complex tasks, which is simply not true. By challenging this stereotype, we can work towards a more equitable society where women have equal access to career opportunities and are not limited by harmful gender norms.",
    "Imagine a world where manual labor was the norm, and production was limited to small-scale, time-consuming processes. Then, suddenly, everything changed. The Industrial Revolution, a period of rapid transformation, swept across the globe, leaving a lasting impact on society, technology, and the economy. This pivotal moment in history, also known as industrialization, was a game-changer, propelling humanity forward at an unprecedented pace.\n\nIn less than a century, the Industrial Revolution reshaped the way people lived, worked, and interacted with one another. It was a true revolution, with far-reaching consequences that affected every aspect of life. Entrepreneurs and innovators seized new opportunities, harnessing the power of machines to drive production and growth. Cities blossomed, becoming hubs of activity and commerce, as people flocked to urban centers in search of work and a better life.\n\nBut the Industrial Revolution was not without its challenges. The introduction of complex machinery displaced unskilled labor, creating a new class of workers who required specialized training and expertise. Many people lost their jobs, while others found new opportunities in the emerging industries. As countries adapted to the new industrial landscape, they began to establish larger economies, expand trade, and forge stronger relationships with their neighbors.\n\nToday, the Industrial Revolution remains a cornerstone of modern society, its influence still felt in every aspect of our lives. It was a turning point in human history, marking the beginning of a new era of growth, innovation, and progress. Despite its ups and downs, the Industrial Revolution's significance cannot be overstated, and its legacy continues to shape our world.",
    "The Miranda warning, a crucial component of the US legal system, informs individuals of their fundamental rights during an arrest. This formal statement, also known as Miranda rights, ensures that the person being detained is aware of their right to remain silent and to an attorney. By providing this warning, law enforcement officers safeguard the integrity of the legal process, protecting both the accused and the prosecution from bias and coercion.\n\nThe Constitution guarantees these rights, and failing to notify individuals of them can render their testimony inadmissible in court. As Rogers and Drogin (2019) note, it's a misconception to assume that everyone is automatically aware of their rights. The Miranda warning serves as a crucial safeguard, ensuring that defendants are not coerced into providing testimony and that prosecutors can rely on admissible evidence.\n\nWhile some may argue that Miranda warnings are unnecessary in certain high-stakes situations, such as the arrest of a dangerous criminal or terrorist, it's essential to remember that these rights form the foundation of a fair and transparent trial. Even in exceptional cases, Miranda rights should not be ignored entirely. Instead, they can be provided once the immediate threat has been neutralized and before formal legal proceedings begin. By upholding the Miranda warning, the legal system can strike a balance between public safety and individual rights, ultimately ensuring a more just and equitable outcome.",
    "A doctor's primary responsibility is to uphold ethical standards, including respecting patients' autonomy and providing loyal care. However, physician-assisted suicide is unethical and contradicts the fundamental principles of the medical profession. By assisting in a patient's death, a doctor would be violating the moral commandment not to take a life and the Hippocratic oath to do no harm. This practice also undermines the trust between patients and medical staff, as it cannot be ethically justified. Furthermore, it goes against religious beliefs and societal moral attitudes, which consider killing to be offensive. Instead of assisting in suicide, doctors should focus on alleviating patients' pain and suffering using available medical treatments.",
    "Unraveling the Enigma of Sexual Orientation: A Quest for Answers\n\nThe age-old debate surrounding sexual orientation identification has sparked intense controversy, with some arguing it's a matter of personal choice, while others believe it's an inherent aspect of one's identity, predetermined by biology. The latter camp asserts that sexuality is an unchangeable trait, deserving of government protection (Sheldon et al., 2017). This project seeks to delve deeper into the complexities of human sexuality, posing a pivotal research question: Does the environment play a role in shaping people's sexual orientation?\n\nTo tackle this question, we've identified two crucial variables using the General Social Survey (GSS) database. The dependent variable, sexort, represents an individual's self-identified sexual orientation, ascertained by asking, \"Which of the following best describes you?\" This variable is critical in understanding the environmental factors that influence a person's sexual identity. The independent variable, sexbirth, denotes the sex assigned at birth, ascertained by asking, \"What sex were you assigned at birth (as indicated on your birth certificate)?\" This variable is essential in identifying respondents' sexuality and distinguishing homosexual individuals.\n\nThe correlation between these two variables holds the key to unlocking the mysteries of sexual orientation. The environment plays a profound role in shaping people's lives and experiences, with males and females often facing vastly different circumstances. Consequently, these environmental differences can significantly impact an individual's identification with their sexual orientation. By exploring this complex relationship, we can gain a deeper understanding of the intricate factors that influence human sexuality.",
    "A key role of a business leader is to make informed decisions, which requires a deep understanding of the company's business environment. The supply and demand theory is a crucial concept in this process, helping managers understand customer behavior and develop effective market strategies. By analyzing supply and demand, businesses can adjust their production and pricing accordingly. For instance, when demand is high, prices can increase, and when demand is low, prices should be lowered to avoid losses.\n\nSuccessful companies have used the supply and demand theory to their advantage. De Beers, for example, maintains high prices for diamonds by limiting supply, making them a rare and coveted commodity. Zappos, an online shoe retailer, has gained control over supply by offering a vast selection, excellent customer service, and a favorable return policy, making it a go-to choice for customers. Apple, a technology giant, creates anticipation for new products, manufacturing demand and making customers feel part of something bigger.\n\nIn conclusion, the supply and demand theory is a valuable tool for navigating the market. By understanding and applying this concept, businesses can develop effective strategies to stay ahead of the competition.",
    "The rise of social media is reshaping the media landscape, relegating traditional outlets to secondary status. Twitter, in particular, has emerged as a powerful platform for staying informed and engaging in debates on various subjects. However, the impact of tweets can be varied and far-reaching. This study examines a tweet by Australian politician Bill Shorten regarding the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS). While Shorten's message conveys a sense of joy and gratitude, it also expresses disappointment and frustration with the current policy limitations. This dual-toned tweet aims to educate and lament the shortcomings of the NDIS. Shorten recounts how a girl received assistance thanks to NDIS funding, but only after her story garnered public attention. He criticizes the Australian government's policy, which he believes restricts the NDIS's ability to help those in need. Despite its mixed message, the tweet has the potential to inspire positive change. A prominent politician's criticism can draw attention to the issue and prompt society and the government to take action. Several indicators suggest that the tweet had a significant impact. According to Casero-Ripollés (2020), influence is measured by activity, popularity, and authority. With 209 retweets, 50 comments, and 858 likes, the tweet generated substantial engagement on a relatively underdiscussed topic. Although the issue's popularity is relatively low, and the engagement metrics are modest compared to Australia's population, Shorten's authority as a knowledgeable and concerned politician lends credibility to his opinion. Therefore, the tweet may have influenced the discussion around NDIS activities, even if its impact is limited to a specific sphere rather than the national level.",
    "In the shadows of the healthcare system, a disturbing trend is emerging: physicians are increasingly encountering victims of human trafficking, often without even realizing it. A chilling example is the case of Dr. W, who was asked to screen women employed by a firm for sexually transmitted infections. But there was a sinister catch: she was instructed not to keep any records, lest the women be arrested. This presented Dr. W with a heart-wrenching dilemma. On one hand, she was duty-bound to uphold patient confidentiality, as enshrined in the American Medical Association's Code of Medical Ethics. On the other hand, she knew that failing to report the situation would condemn these women to further exploitation and potentially spread diseases further.\n\nThis case raises a complex web of issues, spanning criminal law, ethics, human rights, and service provider regulations. From a legal standpoint, Dr. W's agreement to participate in the screening could be seen as complicity in a crime, leaving her vulnerable to prosecution. Moreover, as prostitution is illegal in the US, and minors may be involved, the case falls under mandatory reporting laws. Ethically, the situation is equally fraught, as Dr. W must weigh her duty to protect patient confidentiality against her moral obligation to help victims of human trafficking, including children.\n\nUltimately, the decision to report such cases cannot be equivocal. By turning a blind eye to human trafficking, physicians become complicit in the exploitation of women and children. It is imperative that healthcare providers follow legal frameworks and ethical guidelines, and report suspected cases of human trafficking to bring perpetrators to justice and protect the vulnerable.",
    "Get ready to revolutionize the way you think about ethics! Feminist ethics is all about challenging the status quo and declaring that women's subordination is morally unacceptable. It's time to recognize that women's moral experiences are just as valuable as men's! According to Vaughn (2019), the practical goals of feminist ethics are clear: to call out behaviors and attitudes that undermine women's rights, to find morally sound ways to resist them, and to envision a morally good alternative that empowers women.\n\nThe feminist ethical movement burst onto the scene in the late 1960s, first in public discourse and then in academia, as part of a broader resurgence of feminist thought. Pioneering academics tackled hot-button issues like abortion, fairness, domestic work, sexual violence, and compulsory heterosexuality. Although the term \"feminist ethics\" didn't gain widespread use until the late 1970s or early 1980s (Vaughn, 2019), it was clear that traditional ethics needed a radical overhaul to overcome its male bias.\n\nFeminism is all about pushing the boundaries of ethical thought and discussion. As Vaughn (2019) notes, feminism is fundamentally a normative perspective, and feminists themselves continually challenge and refine its meaning. The obstacles to feminist progress are clear: neglecting women's interests, disregarding their concerns, denying their moral agency, devaluing feminine ideals, and downplaying their experiences. But feminist ethics is so much more than the stereotypes suggest! It's about putting women's interests front and center, recognizing them as ethical authorities, and valuing their unique moral experiences.\n\nToday, modern feminists are pioneering new ways of thinking about moral issues that celebrate their particularity and shared humanity. They're championing fairness, impartiality, and a more inclusive moral landscape. Join the movement and help create a more just and equitable world for all!",
    "**Unmasking the Hidden Truth: The Alarming Reality of Domestic Violence and Abuse**\n\nBehind the closed doors of seemingly ordinary homes, a sinister reality lurks. Domestic violence and abuse, characterized by psychologically or physically aggressive behavior, afflict millions of families worldwide. The statistics are staggering: a staggering 10 million Americans fall victim to violence and abuse every year, according to Huecker et al. (2021). The devastating consequences of such abuse can lead to depression, helplessness, and a shattered sense of self-worth.\n\nBut there is hope. Healthcare providers can play a vital role in identifying the subtle signs of domestic violence, child abuse, and elder abuse. A bruised and battered woman, hesitant to reveal the truth, may unwittingly reveal her secret through her injuries. A child, underweight and fearful of adults, may be hiding a dark secret. An elderly person, sporting bruises and broken glasses, may be suffering in silence.\n\nHealthcare providers must be vigilant and recognize the warning signs. A child who startles easily, an elderly person who is reluctant to take medication, or a caregiver who refuses to leave their charge alone with medical staff – all these can be indicative of a deeper problem.\n\nIt is crucial that healthcare providers report suspected cases of abuse to the relevant authorities. In cases of child abuse, social services must be notified via hotlines or written statements. Elder abuse should be reported to adult protective services, while domestic violence cases should be brought to the attention of local law enforcement.\n\nBefore taking action, however, healthcare providers must discuss the case with a physician or nurse practitioner and examine the patient in a safe and private environment, free from the potential abuser. By working together, we can break the silence and bring hope to those trapped in a cycle of violence and abuse.",
    "Imagine a world where fashion meets technology to bring you the perfect fit. The fashion industry is one of the most dynamic sectors globally, driven by the diverse needs of its customers. Fashion is a personal statement, a reflection of our individuality, and a symbol of our cultural identity. That's why people are always on the lookout for stylish pieces that cater to their unique tastes and budget.\n\nWhile many clothing stores offer a wide range of fashionable items, they often fail to capture our personality and individual needs. This is because their designs are premade, without considering our personal style. Even big brands like Zara and H&M invest heavily in understanding their customers' needs, but they still have a long way to go in terms of global reach. As a result, many of us end up buying what's available, rather than what we really want.\n\nThat's why we created Be-Unique, a project that aims to bridge the gap between what customers want and what clothing stores offer. Our platform uses technology to bring customers closer to their favorite stores, allowing them to digitally access a wide range of clothing items.

    "The editing in the first episode of Money Heist is just as gripping as the plot. From the very first scene, you can feel the energy. As the character prepares to leave her car, the editing is fast-paced, zooming in on the items she's grabbing. This clever technique draws your attention to the objects that will become crucial to the story. You'll notice the ringing phone before it's even picked up! The show's use of quick cuts, close-ups, and objects that reveal character traits - like guns, money, and personal items - keeps you on the edge of your seat. The close-ups of characters are dynamic, using slow dolly shots to reveal the background or follow their movements. This creates a sense of tension and energy, even when the characters are standing still. In intense monologues, the dolly shots keep the tension high, matching the serious tone of the show. You'll also notice that characters are rarely centered in the frame, instead placed off to the side, adding to the sense of unease. Handheld shots are used to convey a sense of insecurity or fear, and the camera moves at the same pace as the characters when they're walking. The switch between smooth dolly shots and handheld 'shaky' shots adds to the drama, creating a sense of suspense and tension. By focusing on close-ups of characters rather than the whole room, the editing keeps you guessing and invested in the story.",
    "The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Static Control, finding that Lexmark's false advertising violated the Lanham Act. The court had to interpret the statute to determine the meaning of the provision. The court rejected Lexmark's argument that Static Control lacked standing, instead finding that the plaintiff's claims fell within the zone of interest protected by the statute. To establish standing, the plaintiff must show a commercial interest injury caused by the defendant's actions. The Lanham Act allows lawsuits for commercial injuries, and the court found that Static Control sufficiently alleged lost sales and reputational harm within the zone of interest. The court's decision was guided by principles of statutory interpretation, rather than tests such as the direct-competitor test or multifactor balancing test.",
    "Effective marketing is crucial for businesses to attract new customers, but not all marketing strategies are ethical. One questionable practice is targeting uninformed consumers, who lack the mental or psychological capacity to make informed decisions. This group includes children, the elderly, and individuals with psychological conditions. It is unethical to target these consumers because they may experience adverse outcomes as a result.\n\nThere are several reasons why targeting uninformed consumers is unethical. Firstly, they can be easily manipulated into buying unnecessary items due to their lack of mental maturity. This is a form of exploitation of vulnerable populations. Secondly, uninformed consumers may struggle to identify false information, making them susceptible to deceptive marketing tactics.\n\nSome argue that targeting uninformed consumers is acceptable because they represent new markets for businesses to tap into. However, it is essential to recognize that these consumers are vulnerable and deserving of special consideration. Therefore, it is unethical to target them.\n\nIn conclusion, this essay has presented strong arguments for why businesses should avoid targeting children, the elderly, and individuals with mental conditions. While some may see these groups as viable markets, it is crucial to prioritize their well-being and avoid exploiting their vulnerabilities.",
    "In the 15th century, the Caribbean became a coveted prize in the game of global conquest. The Spanish, fueled by their thirst for gold and power, established settlements and conquered the Aztec and Inca empires, paving the way for their dominance in the region (Horne, 2018). As they explored the Caribbean, they discovered strategic points that allowed them to invade Mexico and Peru with ease. But the Spanish weren't the only ones with their eyes on the prize. The British and French soon followed, setting up shop on islands like Tortuga and Jamaica (Horne, 2018). By the mid-17th century, privateers from various nations had established permanent colonies and trading zones, drawn by the promise of wealth and riches.\n\nThe Caribbean's treasure trove of gold was a major draw, and the presence of Christopher Columbus had shown the way for other leaders to stake their claim (Horne, 2018). But it wasn't just gold that fueled the conquest - the availability of a labor force from Africa, forced into slavery to work in the region's industrial openings, was a crucial factor. As Spanish power began to wane, other European powers saw an opportunity to expand their presence in the region. Privateers like Francis Drake from England launched attacks on Spanish settlements, and the collaborative efforts of the French, British, and Dutch ultimately led to the conquest of a significant portion of the Caribbean (Horne, 2018).\n\nThe competitive nature of colonialism soon gave rise to bitter wars, making it difficult for the Caribbean islands to unite against their European rulers (Horne, 2018). The emergence of agricultural activities further solidified European control, as the Atlantic slave trade brought thousands of Africans to the region to toil on plantations, strengthening the grip of colonialism. The Caribbean, once a vibrant and diverse region, was forever changed by the forces of conquest and exploitation.",

    "The study's findings ignited a spark for transformative change in nurse-led policy reforms, fueled by the power of bibliometric analysis. By harnessing the insights from integrative reviews, nurses can design innovative programs that drive meaningful progress (Benton et al., 2020). The treasure trove of synthesized studies can empower nurses to spearhead evidence-based reforms in universal health coverage, arming them with concise and trustworthy resources to advocate for change. The potential benefits for working nurses are vast, as they'll be able to tap into a wealth of reliable information to inform their practice. A well-curated database infused with evidence-based research can revolutionize nursing practice, shedding light on hidden gaps in knowledge and daily medical practices (Houser, 2016). This powerful tool can also illuminate nurse-specific areas, such as geriatric care, emergency response, and education. However, the current landscape is marred by limited access to comprehensive information, hindered by bureaucratic red tape and outdated processes. By embracing modern technology, we can break down these barriers, unlocking low-cost and time-efficient methods of information sharing that will supercharge nursing practice. By making evidence-based research accessible and cohesive, we can bridge the knowledge gaps in nurse-specific practices, ultimately elevating the quality of care and work life for nurses.",

    "Have you ever felt like you're stuck in a never-ending cycle of trying to prove yourself as a man? Like, no matter how hard you try, you're just not good enough? That's what Fight Club is all about. It's a raw and unflinching look at the fragility of masculinity and how it can lead to some pretty toxic behaviors.\n\nThe movie shows us a group of guys who are fed up with the expectations placed on them as men. They're tired of being told to be tough, to be strong, and to never show emotion. But the problem is, they don't know how to be men because they didn't have positive male role models in their lives. Many of them were raised by single moms, and as a result, they're struggling to figure out what it means to be a man.\n\nThe film is like a dark mirror held up to society, reflecting back all the ways in which we've gotten masculinity wrong. It's a satire that pokes fun at the idea of what it means to be a \"real man,\" and it challenges us to think about the kind of men we want to be.\n\nBut here's the thing: Fight Club isn't just about tearing down toxic masculinity; it's also about finding a way to build something new in its place. It's about embracing vulnerability, taking responsibility for our actions, and learning to sacrifice for the greater good.\n\nThe ending of the movie is intentionally ambiguous, leaving us with more questions than answers. But that's kind of the point. It's up to us to figure out what it means to be a good man, and to create a new definition of masculinity that's more inclusive, more compassionate, and more honest.",
    "Florence Nightingale, a pioneering Englishwoman, played a crucial role in the development of nursing in 19th-century Europe. Despite societal expectations that noblewomen should not engage in \"unworthy\" activities like helping the poor and sick, Florence dedicated her life to serving others. She sacrificed her personal relationships with her parents to pursue her calling, and her values and commitment ultimately made her a historical figure in modern nursing.\n\nIn 1851, Florence received nursing training from the Sisters of Pastor F. Flender in Germany. She went on to make significant contributions to the treatment of cholera, wartime care, and nursing leadership and reform. Florence's selfless service and leadership helped change the perception of nursing as a noble profession.\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross, founded by A. Dunant, also played a key role in the development of nursing abroad. In 1863, the committee convened a conference in Geneva, where the charter and emblem of the Red Cross were established.\n\nIn the United States, the American Medical Association (AMA) was established, and in 1873, the first three nursing schools were opened, modeled after Florence Nightingale's schools in London. Florence's leadership paved the way for the formation of international humanitarian organizations, and her legacy continues to inspire nurses around the world.",
    "Diana Kendall exposes the shocking truth that our understanding of social class is a fabrication of the media, perpetuating a toxic narrative that legitimizes inequality in the United States. Through biased television programs and newspaper articles, the media has created and reinforced damaging class-based stereotypes, shaping our perceptions and influencing human behavior. The upper class is glorified, portrayed as compassionate and generous, while the lower class is stigmatized, reduced to abstract statistics and dehumanized as lazy, diseased, and criminal.\n\nThe media's skewed portrayal of reality has devastating consequences. By amplifying the voices and concerns of the wealthy, it silences the struggles of the poor, ignoring their needs and perpetuating their suffering. The homeless and impoverished are reduced to mere statistics, stripped of their humanity and dignity. The media's narrative blames the victims, implying that their circumstances are a result of personal failures, rather than acknowledging the systemic injustices and structural barriers that trap them in poverty.\n\nAs a result, the quality of life for low-income individuals continues to deteriorate, their needs overlooked and their voices unheard. The media's fixation on the upper class has created a society where the poor are invisible, their struggles ignored, and their lives exposed to further risk and exploitation. It's time to challenge this toxic narrative and demand a more just and equitable representation of social class in the media.",
    "Although the Monster in Mary Shelley's novel is often viewed as a malevolent character due to its violent actions, it also possesses redeeming qualities. Despite its intimidating appearance, the creature is inexperienced and lacks malicious intentions. As Shelley describes, the Monster's \"gigantic structure and deformity of its aspect\" (Shelley) evoke fear, but its actions are more akin to a curious child exploring its surroundings. The creature's emotional sensitivity allows it to empathize with humans and understand their feelings.\n\nThe novel's Gothic elements, including supernatural themes, medieval architecture, and spiritual explorations of human nature, add depth to the narrative. The story also examines the pursuit of knowledge, the consequences of playing God, and the moral downfall of humanity. I appreciate this genre because it encourages me to consider complex issues from multiple perspectives.\n\nThrough the novel, I gain insight into the motivations and emotions of both Victor Frankenstein and his creation. The use of symbols, such as the Monster, effectively conveys moral lessons about society. Mary Shelley's husband believed that social rejection can lead individuals to become evil, as people's intentions are shaped by their experiences. I agree with this view, as societal treatment can influence an individual's behavior. If society ostracizes people, they may feel no incentive to behave positively.\n\nOne of the novel's central themes is loneliness. The Monster's desire for integration into society is met with fear, disgust, and hatred, driving it to evil deeds. Similarly, modern society often isolates individuals who think differently, leading to feelings of loneliness and disconnection.",
    "The concept of gender roles is often used to analyze and understand literature from different historical periods. In the Anglo-Saxon period, these roles were clearly defined. The epic poem Beowulf, which celebrates brave and martial actions, portrays women as secondary to men. Women are depicted as possessions that serve men's interests and are used to advance the plot, which revolves around male characters. They have minor roles and are often overshadowed by men. For example, the queen of the Swedes is not even given a name, and her identity is defined by her relationship to her husband, King Onela. In contrast, male characters like Hrothgar, Beowulf, Wiglaf, and Unferth dominate the storyline. The few mentions of women in the poem show them fulfilling traditional gender roles, such as taking care of men and being gentle. The character of Queen Modthryth is presented as the opposite of Queen Hygd, who is independent and disliked by men. However, Queen Modthryth is only considered acceptable by society after she marries, implying that women have less value unless they are married.",
    "GMOs are everywhere, but people still can't agree on whether they're a good thing or not. Some folks think it's wrong to mess with genetic info and \"play God\" (MacKinnon & Fiala, 2017). But I think GMOs are just another way we're making our lives better, like when we invented machines, cars, or spaceships. I've eaten GMO-based products, and I'm not too worried about the long-term effects. To me, GMOs are just a fancy way of doing what we've been doing for centuries - selecting the best traits in plants and animals to grow more of what we want. I think it's all about doing what's best for the most people, which is basically the idea behind utilitarianism. GMOs can help us tackle a huge problem like hunger. Since they can thrive in tough conditions, we can grow more crops and feed more people. And let's be real, millions of people are still starving, so producing more food is a win-win. Some people might say it's wrong to mess with genetic codes because it's not our place, but I think that's a pretty narrow view. Even the Bible says we're supposed to take care of the planet, so using cool new tools to do that is just another way to follow those principles and look out for all living things.",
    "The phenomenon of companies expanding globally has long fascinated researchers in the field of management, captivating their attention with its intricate complexities. Over the past decade, the focus has shifted from weighing the benefits and risks of internationalization to delving into the strategies employed by multinational corporations as they navigate the intricacies of operating and developing in diverse markets. However, it is essential to acknowledge that globalization creates a dynamic and uncertain institutional environment, replete with risks and challenges, which global companies must adeptly navigate.\n\nThe primary driving force behind globalization and internationalization is the allure of significantly expanded market opportunities, encompassing both production and trade. This, in turn, is linked to the numerous advantages accrued from implementing an international strategy, including market growth, economies of scale, learning opportunities, and the benefits of establishing a presence in new locations. Many companies from emerging economies, such as China, India, and Taiwan, have successfully integrated into global value chains in high-tech sectors, leveraging their unique strengths and capabilities (Stallkamp & Schotter, 2019).\n\nHowever, this phenomenon also gives rise to a myriad of challenges inherent in international companies operating in these countries. For instance, emerging markets often struggle with inadequate government oversight and regulation, leading to unethical and criminal business practices among global companies. A stark example of this is the exploitation of cheap local labor to reduce production costs, a morally reprehensible practice that can have severe consequences for the company in the long run (Mashan, 2021).\n\nDespite the benefits of international diversification, some firms opt not to expand globally, citing various reasons. One of the primary reasons is the reluctance to venture beyond their domestic market, often due to a fear of confronting the risks associated with globalization or an initial calculation of opportunities that only considers factors within their home market (Paul & Mas, 2019). Additionally, companies may be deterred by the complexities of navigating foreign markets, including cultural, religious, and customs differences that can significantly impact their operations. Thus, a global strategy presents both colossal advantages and disadvantages, which can either attract or repel companies from adopting this approach.",
    "Gnomial Functions Inc. is seeking to identify the most reliable forecasting technique to predict sales levels for the next eighteen months. Over the past 18 months, the company has experienced a consistent increase in sales with minimal seasonal variation. However, recent sales data has shown a significant impact on future sales performance (Wisniewski, 2016). Given this trend, the weighted moving average method is recommended for forecasting sales levels. This approach assigns weights to previous months' sales data, with more recent data receiving higher weights due to its greater relevance to future sales. Specifically, the weighted moving average uses four weights, ranging from 0.1 to 0.4, to generate an accurate forecast.\n\nBy adjusting the weights to give more importance to recent monthly sales, the company can further reduce forecasting errors. For instance, when the initial weights (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4) are applied, the mean absolute deviation and mean standard error are 6.27 and 47.29, respectively. In contrast, when the weights are adjusted to prioritize recent performance (0, 0, 0.4, and 0.6), the mean absolute deviation decreases to 4.81, and the mean standard error declines to 27.28. This performance surpasses that of the simple moving average.\n\nBased on these findings, Gnomial Functions Inc. should adopt the weighted moving average method to forecast sales levels for the next year. This approach is not only simple and effective but also reliable and adaptable to changes in sales trends. By adjusting the weights to reflect the importance of recent months, the company can refine its forecasting accuracy and make informed business decisions.",
    "Imagine a world where the economy is a complex web of uncertainty, making it nearly impossible to predict when disaster will strike. The threat of recession looms large, casting a dark shadow over our lives. In times of crisis, our instincts kick in, and we're driven to survive - to run, hide, and protect ourselves from the unknown. That's where crisis intervention comes in, a vital discipline that provides emergency emotional support to those affected by mental and physical trauma.\n\nBut the stakes are high. An economic downturn can have far-reaching consequences, impacting entire populations and leaving a trail of devastation in its wake. For me, the thought of living through a recession is unbearable - it would turn my life upside down. The crisis takes a disproportionate toll on those working for non-profit organizations, leading to widespread layoffs and forcing people to rely on state handouts. The inability to find a job is a ticking time bomb, and the resulting poverty would leave people homeless and struggling to make ends meet.\n\nFrom a professional perspective, the crisis is a ticking time bomb that threatens to destroy entire sectors of the economy, not just individual businesses. The cost of credit skyrockets, and attracting investors becomes a daunting task. What's more, relationships with international partners begin to fray. In short, a recession is a catastrophic event that unleashes unpredictable and devastating consequences. It's a scenario that's too dire to contemplate.",
    "The YouTube video \"GP Training in Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services\" by GP Synergy highlights the vital role of Aboriginal Medical Services in providing culturally sensitive and high-quality care to marginalized and underserved communities. These services are essential for addressing the unique health concerns of Aboriginal populations, ensuring they receive affordable and convenient healthcare that caters to their specific needs. The comprehensive approach of these medical facilities enables patients to access a range of services that support multiple aspects of their lives. By addressing the social determinants of health, including safe housing, education, and racial discrimination, Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services aim to reduce health disparities and inequities faced by Aboriginal patients. Patient education is crucial in this context, as it empowers individuals to take control of their health and seek early prevention and management. The video emphasizes the importance of addressing discrimination, a significant social determinant of health, which can lead to care discontinuity and poor health outcomes. Healthcare workers must be prepared to provide culturally sensitive services, build meaningful relationships with patients, and advocate for their needs in the healthcare system and broader society. Ultimately, addressing the social determinants of health requires a dedicated and collaborative approach that prioritizes the unique needs of Aboriginal patients and communities.",
    "The cultural implications of Roman dominance over Greek-speaking regions have garnered significant scientific attention in recent years. The impact of Roman-Greek cultural exchange varied across time and space, with Roman communities serving as key influencers. As these communities coexisted with Greeks, Roman elements were incorporated into public life, including the adoption of Roman names. This phenomenon can be attributed to networks of exchange and the sense of identity among those who bore these names. According to Rizakis (2019), the introduction of Greeks to the Roman naming system and the adoption of Roman names by non-citizen Greeks were two distinct processes, both exemplifying the interaction between the two cultural traditions. This interaction ultimately led to the emergence of a shared onomastic culture, which became more pronounced in the 2nd century AD and exhibited regional variability. Civic elites played a crucial role in mediating these cultural transfers, using names to exert influence both regionally and systemically. The use of tria nomina, particularly during the imperial period, was a symbol of pride, power, and prestige, leading to the adoption of certain names by lower classes, albeit on a limited scale. However, the dominance of Roman names as a distinguishing feature of the Empire's free citizens was short-lived. By the end of the 3rd century AD, a new identity expression emerged, characterized by the use of separate Greek and Roman names. Initially used sparingly, this practice became widespread during the late antiquity period, particularly after Constantine's reign. This shift, facilitated by Christianity's progress and the Roman Empire's decline, can be seen as a return to the Greek naming tradition.",
    "Meet the health promoters - a dedicated team of professionals who work tirelessly to improve our health and wellbeing through a range of activities. Their top priorities include empowering individuals, promoting societal responsibility for health, and creating an environment that supports personal growth and community action (Nutbeam, 2019). \n\nIn the world of health promotion, experts from various fields have come together to agree on the key characteristics of effective collaboration and an interdisciplinary approach. By bringing together diverse perspectives and expertise, interdisciplinary teams can provide comprehensive care and support. This collaboration is crucial for successful health promotion, and it's not just about medical services or doctors and nurses (Nutbeam, 2019). \n\nHealth promotion involves a wide range of activities that require a diverse set of skills from various health professionals and industries. That's why it's so important to have a multidisciplinary team that includes experts like Nurse Practitioners (NPs), Social Workers (SWs), and Registered Nurses (RNs). \n\nNurse Practitioners are highly trained nurses who can treat a wide range of conditions, provide preventative care, and educate patients on healthy habits (Pun, 2018). Social Workers are specialized in helping individuals and groups develop skills and overcome challenges, whether they're personal, interpersonal, or social in nature (Nutbeam, 2019). Registered Nurses are skilled in assessing healthcare needs and determining the best course of treatment, care provider, and equipment to deliver top-notch patient care (Pun, 2018). \n\nBy working together, these professionals can make a real difference in our health and wellbeing. Their unique skills and approaches are essential to the success of an interdisciplinary team focused on health promotion.",
    "The evolution of music parallels the transformations in society, with the period between 1959 and 1963 serving as a pivotal turning point. During this time, the music industry underwent a significant shift, giving rise to two distinct markets (Covach and Flory 112). On one hand, a new generation of teenagers emerged, driving the demand for upbeat dance music (Covach and Flory 113). On the other hand, former rock and roll enthusiasts began to gravitate towards folk music, which addressed social, political, and economic concerns (Covach and Flory 113). With its rich history of tackling societal issues, folk music appeared more committed to the community than commercial pop, fostering a sense of connection with its audience (Covach and Flory 118-119). Folk performers, relatable and down-to-earth, resonated with their listeners, who saw them as representatives of the people rather than elevated stars (Covach and Flory 119). The accessibility of folk music, requiring only basic guitar skills, further democratized the genre, spreading the idea that it was \"of the people, by the people\" (Covach and Flory 119-120). This movement, characterized by its emphasis on social issues and community, was spearheaded by influential figures such as Pete Seeger and The Weavers, who prioritized simplicity and social commentary (Covach and Flory 119). The Kingston Trio, with their pop-infused approach, played a significant role in popularizing folk music in the mainstream market, defining the genre for many listeners (Covach and Flory 120-121). Throughout this period, numerous singers contributed to the folk movement, using their music as a powerful tool for addressing societal concerns.",
    "A long time ago, the Roman Empire believed in many gods and goddesses. They thought these gods helped create their city and affected their daily lives. Because Rome was located near Greece, they borrowed many ideas from the Greeks, like their culture and traditions. The Romans even copied some of their government ideas, like having leaders called Consuls.\n\nIn Rome, being a citizen was a big deal. Only boys could become full citizens, and they got this status because of their parents. If a kid was born to a mom and dad who were both citizens, they automatically became a citizen too. It's kind of like how, in the United States, you can become a citizen by being born here or by having parents who are citizens. You can even become a citizen later in life if your parents get married to a U.S. citizen.",

Therefore, they should strive to ensure the well-being of everyone involved, including healthcare providers of critical patients and consulting staff. Our financial plan is designed to benefit all stakeholders and honor God.\n\n**Potential Holes and Unknowns in the Project's Financial Plan**\n\nWhile our financial plan addresses most expenses, there are still some unknowns to consider. Managers should always prepare for the worst-case scenario. In our project, there are two main unknowns:\n\n1. **Demand for Mental Health Services**: It's difficult to predict the real demand for mental health services among doctors, which affects the required number of mental health workers.\n2. **Inflation and Price Increases**: Potential crises and inflation rates may cause price increases, necessitating additional funds for equipment, medication, services, training, and maintenance.\n\n**Assumptions to Fill the Potential Holes in the Project's Financial Plan**\n\nTo mitigate these risks, we can make the following assumptions:\n\n1. **Average Demand for Mental Health Services**: Assuming an average demand for mental health services among healthcare professionals can help partly mitigate the risks of unknown demand.\n2. **Unforeseen Expenditures**: Assuming a certain amount of money for unforeseen expenditures can help the organization prepare for potential price increases and inflation.",
    "The article \"The influence of peers during adolescence: Does homophobic name-calling by peers change gender identity?\" suggests that negative name-calling among peers can have a profound impact on an individual's gender identity. This is because negative experiences with same-sex peers can lead to a desire to identify with peers of the opposite sex. Additionally, during adolescence, one's identity is still in flux, and individuals are constantly reassessing their identity formation. Research has shown that homophobia can affect both homosexual and heterosexual adolescents, as the primary goal of victimization is to cause emotional harm rather than highlight actual flaws. Gender identity development is a critical aspect of personality formation during adolescence, and homophobic name-calling is a form of victimization that should be discouraged or banned in schools. Interestingly, bullies may engage in homophobic name-calling as a way to demonstrate their own gender conformity, particularly among male bullies. It is essential to understand this dynamic to address gender-based victimization. Furthermore, victimization of adolescents, including LGB, trans, and heterosexual students, can lead to anxiety, depression, and substance use disorders, especially among sexual and gender minority youth. This highlights the need for concurrent prevention practices to address substance abuse among adolescents, recognizing that substance abuse is often a consequence of underlying psychological issues.",
    "The Bible first mentions homosexuality in the book of Leviticus, where it is prohibited. The passage states, \"Do not lie down with a man as with a woman: this is an abomination\" (Leviticus 18:22). The Apostle Paul also writes about it, saying that men who reject natural relationships with women and instead desire each other will face consequences (Romans 1:27).\n\nIt's important to note that the Bible does not discuss sexual orientation as we understand it today, but rather focuses on specific sexual acts. The concept of sexual orientation as an inherent part of a person's identity is a relatively modern idea that emerged in the late 19th century.\n\nHistorically, homosexuality has existed in all societies, but it was never considered equal to heterosexual relationships. In fact, it was often persecuted and punished severely. In Christian societies, sodomy was punishable by death, and the Inquisition targeted homosexuals. The Code of Justinian in Byzantium also prescribed harsh punishments, including castration and death.\n\nIt's crucial to recognize that the persecution of homosexuals was often justified by religious beliefs. However, the idea of a same-sex union as a legitimate and equal relationship did not exist, even as a philosophical concept. Instead, homosexuality was seen as a deviation from the norm and was not fundamentally accepted.",
    "The Constitution's framers were skeptical about citizens' willingness to engage in the country's political life, doubting their interest and knowledge of political affairs. However, with the advent of mass media, people now have access to a wealth of information about political events, enabling them to make informed decisions. The media plays a crucial role in keeping citizens informed, acting as a watchdog over government powers and providing a platform for people to share their views. While it is essential to maintain a critical perspective and not rely solely on the media, it is evident that citizens are more engaged and informed than ever before.\n\nIn contrast to the framers' beliefs, many organizations today actively promote civil rights and freedoms, closely monitoring the political landscape. Citizens are proactive in staying informed and voicing their opinions, even in the absence of a crisis. The media facilitates this process, providing access to global events and enabling people to stay up-to-date. Moreover, there are individuals who consistently hold those in power accountable, regardless of the political or economic climate. These individuals deserve recognition for their role in ensuring that the judicial, legislative, and executive branches of government remain accountable to the people.",
    "Olivier Armantier and his co-authors published an article titled \"How Economic Crises Affect Inflation Beliefs: Evidence from the COVID-19 Pandemic\" in the Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization on July 24, 2021. The publisher, Elsevier, offers various options for reusing the content through its partnership with the Copyright Center RightsLink service.\n\nThis independent article focuses on the public's perception of the economy during the COVID-19 pandemic. The authors examine how people's views on inflation changed during the first six months of the pandemic. Their research complements other studies on economic changes during the COVID-19 recession.\n\nA key feature of the article is the authors' analysis of the consequences of inflationary crises and their comparison with previous crises to assess the overall impact of the crisis. The survey aims to collect data on a wide range of economic outcomes.\n\nThe authors' research reveals that the growth of inflationary expectations was more restrained than expected. However, this masks a significant polarization of views, particularly in the short term. A significant proportion of households, especially those with higher education, initially expected the pandemic to lead to low inflation or even deflation.\n\nThe authors present their findings through numerous graphs and tables, achieving their goal of understanding household responses to non-traditionally triggered crises. They also conduct a comparative analysis with past crises, such as the Great Recession, to determine how erroneous assumptions about inflation can spread to other areas of the economy.\n\nI found the study particularly insightful because it highlights the strong polarization of inflation perceptions and identifies differences between demographic groups.",
    "The pervasive adoption of digital technology has unequivocally established email as a vital medium of communication. By facilitating instantaneous exchange with colleagues, relatives, loved ones, and business partners, email has revolutionized the way we connect, eliminating the constraints of traditional physical communication. A closer examination of the impact of email on interpersonal communication reveals two significant effects. Firstly, email has dramatically expanded the scope of communication, transcending geographical boundaries and enabling seamless online interactions. This paradigm shift has fundamentally altered our perception of interpersonal communication, rendering it more accessible and convenient. Furthermore, email has transformed the dynamics of nonverbal communication, as emotional cues and body language are no longer applicable in text-based exchanges, particularly in professional settings (Smith, n.d.). While emojis and stickers offer some alternatives, their use is generally discouraged in formal emails, unlike in informal messaging platforms. The advantages of email are undeniable, including enhanced accessibility, limitless communication, and perpetual connectivity. However, it is crucial to acknowledge the potential drawbacks, such as dependence on internet infrastructure, the need for electronic devices, and cybersecurity concerns. Moreover, individuals often commit errors in electronic correspondence by applying real-world communication skills to the digital realm. These mistakes include neglecting the type of recipient, disregarding digital etiquette, and sending lengthy, unstructured messages (CNBC, 2018). To avoid these pitfalls, it is essential to master the principles of electronic etiquette, review messages before sending, and tailor communication styles to specific recipients, while ensuring brevity and clarity.",
    "Despite the emphasis on customer satisfaction and work engagement, many American corporate executives remain fixated on their companies' financial growth. While making a profit is essential to a company's survival, it's equally important to recognize that financial growth is not the only metric of success. In reality, some businesses lack the financial resources to capitalize on available market opportunities, while others have opportunities that don't align with their financial means.\n\nA company's growth is influenced by its access to finance and product-market opportunities. To determine a sustainable growth rate, managers must consider the interplay between inflation, capital costs, profitability, growth, and the market value of their company's common stock. A company's profitability depends on two key factors: the expected return on equity (ROE) and the cost of capital. If the ROE is expected to exceed the cost of equity capital, growth will have a positive impact on the business. Conversely, if the ROE is not expected to surpass the cost of capital, the company should consider a strategy of rapid negative growth or slowing growth to avoid devastating consequences.\n\nTo maintain a healthy growth rate, a company must meet inflation expectations and even surpass the inflation rate. For instance, if the inflation rate is 10%, the company must not only maintain its earnings to beat the inflation rate but also strive to achieve higher results. According to historical data, companies must grow fast enough to keep the cost of equity capital for common stock at 19-20% to remain attractive to investors. This means that a business should grow in tandem with the inflation rate and other indicators.\n\nUltimately, a company's ability to grow sustainably depends on its ability to balance its ROE and cost of equity capital. When the ROE surpasses the cost of equity capital, a company can create ample growth. However, if a business grows more rapidly than it can manage, it can harm its financial health. By understanding these critical factors, companies can develop a growth strategy that aligns with their financial means and market opportunities.",
    "The chapter explores how global trade has transformed and enriched cultures worldwide. During this period, wealthy rulers and merchants showcased their power by collecting exotic art pieces. The exchange of ideas, books, and cultural practices was thriving, leading to increased tolerance and appreciation of diversity. As globalization continued to strengthen, connections between cultures deepened. European influence had become so pervasive that Western norms and habits were seen as universal and objective standards (Adelman et al., 2021, p. 597).\n\nThis era is marked by the Enlightenment, a time when human reason triumphed, and people believed they could understand the laws of nature and human behavior. The chapter's significance lies in its comprehensive analysis of the period, highlighting the contributions of each continent. Notable events include the formation of a powerful alliance between the Ottoman, Safavid, and Mughal dynasties in West and South Asia, which contributed to the cultural development of their respective countries.\n\nThe chapter also explores the development of China, Japan, the Americas, African slave states, and Australia, emphasizing how the interaction and mutual influence of different cultures drove their growth. The 16th to 18th centuries witnessed a global cultural renaissance, fueled by the growth of new wealth (Adelman et al., 2021, p. 595). This led to an increase in book consumption and the creation of new, previously unseen monuments (Adelman et al., 2021, p. 595). The world became increasingly interconnected due to international trade, although not all countries were willing to adapt to the new norms. While the Islamic and Chinese worlds maintained their identities, America and Oceania were more susceptible to European cultural pressure.",
    "**The Opioid Crisis in the United States**\n\nOpioids have become the most widely used drug in the United States, with a long history of being effective pain relievers. However, their relaxing effects have led to recreational abuse, causing a strong feeling of euphoria and a high risk of addiction. Addicted individuals often experience a constant desire to increase their dose, resulting in severe medical and social problems.\n\nThe United States is currently facing one of the worst drug crises in history, with more than half of drug-related deaths attributed to prescription opioids, such as heroin and fentanyl (Coon et al., 2022). The crisis has worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic, posing a significant threat to the economy and national security.\n\n**Treatment Options for Opioid Addiction**\n\nThe most effective way to overcome opioid addiction is through \"substitution therapy,\" which involves using a less addictive drug as a legal alternative to heroin and other highly addictive substances. Three approved substances for substitution therapy are methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone (Volkow et al., 2014). These medications are carefully selected to avoid unwanted psychoactive effects. Additional treatments, such as tranquilizers, antidepressants, antipsychotics, and non-opioid analgesics, may also be used to alleviate the patient's condition. Symptomatic treatment and supportive therapy are also widely used (Volkow et al., 2014). In severe cases of withdrawal, patients require constant medical supervision.\n\n**Supporting a Loved One with Opioid Addiction**\n\nFamily support is crucial in motivating individuals to seek treatment for opioid addiction. Rehab centers offer an effective chance for addicted individuals to return to a healthy, drug-free life through unique rehabilitation programs that focus on overcoming addiction and adopting a healthy lifestyle (Brown, 2018). To provide effective motivation, psychiatrists must gather information about the addicted individual, including their psychological atmosphere, habits, interests, and family relationships, with the assistance of relatives and friends.",

    "IKEA's global success can be attributed to its masterful implementation of the marketing mix. The company has skillfully tailored its strategy to each market, showcasing its adaptability, flexibility, and creativity, which has led to widespread recognition of its products. IKEA's innovative marketing approach serves as a model for other companies worldwide. This paper will delve into the four key components of IKEA's marketing mix. The Swedish company has earned a reputation for producing high-quality, accessible, and innovative products. \n\nAt the heart of IKEA's pricing strategy is affordability, achieved through optimized store structures and logistics that minimize costs (O'Neill, 2021). The company's promotional efforts are extensive, utilizing various communication channels, including local radio stations and region-specific social media accounts. IKEA stays ahead of the curve by employing modern advertising tactics, such as partnering with influencers to reach younger demographics (O'Neill, 2021). When selecting locations, IKEA prioritizes accessibility while maintaining low prices. \n\nHowever, the company's most distinctive feature is its products. IKEA's home furniture is instantly recognizable due to its unique style, modular design, and reusability (O'Neill, 2021). The company continuously introduces new products, encouraging customers to visit regularly. In summary, IKEA's marketing mix demonstrates how affordable, stylish, and recognizable products can capture customers' loyalty and ensure a company's long-term success. With a vast range of modular furniture catering to diverse needs and tastes, IKEA has secured a significant competitive edge in Europe and globally.",
    "In \"Mexicans in the Making of America,\" Neil Foley uncovers the pivotal role Mexican Americans have played in shaping the United States' history. In the captivating first chapter, \"The Genesis of Mexican America,\" Foley delves into the tumultuous past, revealing the silent conflict between the two nations and the origins of Mexican Americans. He boldly challenges the prevailing narrative, arguing that the U.S. government has perpetuated a damaging stereotype of Mexican immigrants as lazy, violent, and criminal (Foley 34). However, Foley turns the tables, exposing the shocking truth that it was white settlers from the southern states who illegally invaded Texas in the 1830s, refusing to obey the law (Imery-Garcia 12).\n\nFoley's groundbreaking research reveals that the roots of discrimination against Mexican immigrants and citizens can be traced back to the 1846-1848 war and the subsequent treaty, which annexed Texas and its Mexican inhabitants into U.S. territory, stripping them of their rights. This chapter is a fascinating exploration of the U.S. public's perception of Mexico as a nation of cruel and uneducated people, conveniently forgetting the rich legacy of the Aztec Empire, Mexico's early abolition of slavery, and the annexation of Texas.\n\nThe 1846-1848 war is exposed as a brutal and unjust act of aggression by the U.S. government against its weaker neighbor, which was already reeling from economic collapse (Foley 24). The post-war legislation offered a Hobson's choice: return to Mexico or become a U.S. citizen with nominal equal rights that were never truly respected (Gutiérrez 5). As a result, many Mexican Americans opted to identify as Spanish Americans to avoid the stigma associated with their heritage. Foley's compelling argument is that this pivotal event not only created a physical border between the two nations but also sowed the seeds of misunderstanding that would plague their relationship for generations to come.\n\nIn summary, the first chapter of \"Mexicans in the Making of America\" is a riveting exploration of the origins of Mexican Americans, shedding light on the pivotal role of the U.S.-Mexico war in shaping the future political climate between the two nations. The annexation of Texas had far-reaching consequences, damaging relations and perpetuating negative stereotypes of Mexican immigrant workers, while driving many Mexican Americans to conceal their ancestry.",
    "In situations where multiple individuals interact simultaneously, particularly in educational settings, the potential for conflicts and disagreements arises. Research suggests that dominant or negative group members can significantly impact the team's atmosphere (Jacobs et al., 2016). It appears that individuals who exhibit show-off behavior can negatively influence the mood of their peers, as their actions can be perceived as irritating (Jacobs et al., 2016). Furthermore, show-offs often strive to impress others, including group leaders, by engaging in uninterrupted talking or boasting, which can distract other members and hinder their participation.\n\nThis behavior is commonly observed in group settings, where individuals may seek to draw attention to themselves due to feelings of insecurity or lack of confidence. As a result, show-offs tend to dominate discussions, answering questions even when not addressed to them, and may ask irrelevant or off-topic questions to attract the leader's attention. In fact, their constant involvement can create an obstacle to achieving a productive learning environment, as it can lead to irritation and a lack of knowledge acquisition during the lesson.\n\nThe persistent involvement of show-offs in the educational process can also lead to frustration among other group members, potentially resulting in resentment towards such behavior (Forsyth, 2019). Moreover, show-offs can prevent the group from achieving its objectives by distracting others with their antics and over-involvement in the process. Overall, such individuals can compromise the group's productivity and effectiveness in learning by prioritizing self-promotion over allowing others to realize their potential within the setting.",
    "The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the airline industry, with widespread travel restrictions implemented by governments worldwide (Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Aviation, 2022). Consequently, the regulatory measures have adversely affected the standard revenue, business operations, and practices of airline companies. The decline in passenger demand can be attributed to factors such as stringent testing regulations, limited resources, and reduced business travel requirements. Furthermore, the quarantine measures aimed at reducing COVID-19 cases have also contributed to the decline in demand. As a result, the industry has experienced a significant revenue loss of $372 billion, an unprecedented change in the sector (Economic impacts of covid-19 on Civil Aviation, 2021). The subsequent cancellation of flights and employee layoffs were inevitable, given the challenging circumstances under which airlines struggled to sustain operations with a drastically reduced passenger load. The pandemic has presented major economic challenges to the airline industry, characterized by a substantial reduction in available seats (-50%) and a decline in air travel passengers (-2.7 billion) (Economic impacts of covid-19 on Civil Aviation, 2021). However, the impact was somewhat mitigated by the increased demand for cargo flights, which were utilized for the transportation of medical supplies (Nižetić, 2020, p. 10953). Fortunately, with the rollout of vaccines and the relaxation of travel restrictions, the situation began to improve in 2021. The industry has witnessed a slight recovery, with a lower revenue loss of $324 billion, indicating a positive trend that is expected to continue in the coming years.",
    "The researchers' conclusion is grounded in three meticulously designed case studies that explore the application of software in various contexts. These studies examine the analysis of bone fractures resulting from traffic accidents, spade-inflicted injuries, and gunshot wounds to the head, providing invaluable insights into enhancing modern forensic investigations (Buck et al., 2008). The cutting-edge modeling software and haptic device employed in the study boast exceptional precision, low friction, superior fidelity, and a six-degree freedom output capacity, setting a new standard in the field. While replicating the study to verify the findings may be challenging due to the high cost of assembling the required specimens and equipment (Pinzon et al., 2016), the researchers' interpretations and conclusions drawn from the three case studies are well-substantiated. The results unequivocally demonstrate the potential of haptic devices to revolutionize post-mortem and forensic investigations, enabling investigators to recreate crime scenes with enhanced precision and speed. In forensic science, this technology can facilitate the recreation of crime scenes, such as gun-holding positions, and identify objects used in crimes with unprecedented accuracy (Hagmann et al., 2021). The innovation is significant, as it allows users to interact with 3D digital information in a tactile manner, overcoming the limitations of virtual environments. However, concerns regarding the potential for corrupting operating systems and online hacking to manipulate investigation findings may arise (Joukal et al., 2015), which could impact the reliability of these devices in criminal justice proceedings. Furthermore, the high cost of equipment and personnel training may hinder the adoption of this technology in low-income areas, potentially limiting access to justice (Fahrni et al., 2019). Nevertheless, the researchers' conclusions, based on their rigorous case studies, highlight the immense potential of haptic technology to transform forensic investigations.",
    "The Roots of Slavery in America: A Complex and Controversial History\n\nBetween 1526 and 1776, a tangled web of factors shaped the institution of slavery in the United States. Historians have proposed a multitude of theories to explain how the transatlantic slave trade evolved, but one thing is clear: the demand for labor in European colonies, particularly in the Caribbean and South America's sugar plantation industries, played a significant role. The British, Spanish, French, and Dutch all relied heavily on slave labor, transporting captives from Africa and enslaving indigenous peoples in North America on a smaller scale. However, Indian slavery eventually came to an end in the late 18th century.\n\nBut how did slavery play out differently in each colonial territory of British North America? Enslaved people toiled in a variety of industries, from breweries and shipyards to plantations and timber yards. In the regions north of Maryland, however, slavery gradually gave way to free labor. The slave population in the North steadily declined throughout the 1760s and 1770s, with Philadelphia's slave population dwindling to just 700 by 1775. Antislavery activism was alive and well in the city, with nationalist pamphleteers distributing antislavery literature to blacks and whites alike. The presence of antislavery groups facilitated the spread of manumissions, making slavery increasingly untenable in the North.\n\nNew York, on the other hand, had a high percentage of slaves who acquired valuable trades like masonry and goldsmithing, working alongside skilled artisans. Despite the abolitionist sentiment in the North during the Revolutionary War, it wasn't until 1827 that all slaves in New York were finally freed.\n\nSo what was the difference between indentured servants and slaves? Indentured service was a type of debt servitude, where an individual agreed to a set period of unpaid labor in exchange for their passage to America. While indentured workers were provided with room and board, they were not paid a wage. Slaves, on the other hand, were considered property, and their freedom was only granted on rare occasions, no matter how many years of backbreaking labor they endured. Slaves were bought, sold, traded, and even used as collateral in wills - a stark reminder of the brutal reality of slavery in America.",
    "The issue of tribal sovereignty has been subject to intense scrutiny over the years, with treatment of tribes ranging from supportive measures and attempts at integration into the broader community to outright persecution. In this context, the law on tribal gaming can be seen as a significant step towards recognizing tribes' unique way of life and self-determination. This essay explores the question of how the Tribal Gaming Act can contribute to the sovereignty of tribes.\n\nUnder the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, tribes were granted the right to determine the gaming activities they wished to engage in, with permission typically granted by the state. These activities could include tribal rituals or games of chance, depending on the tribe's wishes, and required state approval (Light and Rand). As tribal games are often unique and hold deep cultural significance, it is essential to recognize tribes' right to host their own games. This measure helps to preserve their cultural heritage and establish sovereignty over a vital aspect of life, namely leisure and relaxation. Moreover, gaming activities support the continuation of traditions and customs through rituals that have evolved over centuries.\n\nIn terms of sovereignty, gaming serves to establish spheres of life that are entirely under tribal jurisdiction. For instance, while some tribe members may integrate into mainstream society, finding employment or living in urban areas, traditional tribal gaming acts as a reminder of their roots, promoting freedom of choice and sovereignty. As one of the few areas almost entirely under tribal control, gaming reinforces tribal autonomy and self-governance.",
    "Individual freedoms and national security are often seen as opposing concepts, but in a democratic system, individual freedoms should take precedence. The US Constitution protects individual rights, and sacrificing them for national security goes against democratic principles. In a democracy, individual freedoms are fundamental and should not be violated, even in areas like migration, cybersecurity, and international relations. While authoritarian regimes may prioritize national security over individual freedoms, this approach is wrong because national security should protect the interests of every citizen, not just the nation. In contrast, democratic states consider individual freedoms sacred and essential to their integrity.",
    "Rihanna's chart-topping single \"Elements Diamonds\" premiered on the Elvis Duran Show on September 26, 2012, and was made available for online download just an hour later. The following day, it was officially released as the lead single from her seventh studio album, Unapologetic. Interestingly, Sia penned the song specifically for Rihanna, who owns the copyrights and had been working on it for a year prior. Rihanna's rendition of \"Diamonds\" was heavily influenced by Sia's demo vocals, with the Barbadian artist meticulously mimicking the Australian songwriter's inflections. It wasn't until Benny Blanco heard the final track that Sia realized her vocals had been replicated with precision. The song's lyrics, which explore the coexistence of love and diamonds, convey a message of hope and resilience. The diamonds symbolize a beacon of light in dark times, inspiring listeners to focus on the possibilities that arise when things don't go as planned. I chose this song because of its uplifting and optimistic tone, which always leaves me feeling energized and motivated. Moreover, its inspirational message of self-love has resonated with listeners worldwide, earning it numerous awards and cementing its status as a timeless classic. The song's catchy melody and instant recognizability have also been a significant boost to Rihanna's career.",
    "Diverse situations in which medical professionals have operated have resulted in the development of varied leadership approaches. For instance, the COVID-19 pandemic underscored the significance of transparent dialogue and the importance of swift preparedness in top healthcare executives (Nicola et al., 2020). Another crucial tactic involves the utilization of external catalysts that ultimately foster exceptional organizational decision-making (Alagoz et al., 2018). Furthermore, one study revealed how implementing optimism-related and receptive approaches as leaders can enhance their employees' resilience, providing an additional source of inspiration (Wei et al., 2018). Thus, effective healthcare leaders must be adaptable to various external changes and strategically interact with their colleagues. Multiple departments can be engaged with through the role of a healthcare administrator. One of them includes the in-patient department, where diverse approaches from skilled experts are necessary. Moreover, critical care and emergency services require exceptional management and collaborative opportunities. As previously mentioned, the selected healthcare areas are prime examples of fields requiring strong leaders to provide optimal patient care. One way this can be improved to achieve the desired outcomes is through a comprehensive approach that considers external and internal factors. Additionally, collective decision-making should not be viewed as restrictive to effective leadership; on the contrary, it presents an ideal strategy in healthcare management. The significance of interprofessional collaboration in medical institutions is evident through its impact on patient outcomes. Research has demonstrated substantial changes in healthcare conditions after the implementation of the strategy (Spaulding et al., 2018). The method involves acquiring expertise from colleagues and incorporating it into one's practice, seeking guidance from the respective medical staff. Therefore, the strategy affects the range of services professionals can offer to their patients and should be further developed to improve its practicality.",
    "Net Present Value (NPV) is the expected profit from a project after costs are recouped. It indicates whether a project is worth investing in based on costs and potential risks. NPV has several advantages over other investment criteria:\n\n* It considers the present value of money, recognizing that currency values change over time.\n* It's flexible and additive, allowing for the evaluation of multiple projects or a single project's cost of capital.\n* It's a one-dimensional indicator that considers the size of the investment and the probability of wealth creation.\n\nOverall, NPV provides a clear and comprehensive picture of a project's potential profitability.",
    "To run a business well, you need to look at the environment outside the company. For 7-Eleven, this means studying the industry and competitors like Walmart and Target. The convenience store industry is growing and making a lot of money, which is good for 7-Eleven. People want more choices and have more money to spend, so the industry is attractive. To do well, 7-Eleven needs to choose a strategy that will bring in more money than usual. One idea is to open stores in many countries. To do this, 7-Eleven needs the right products and resources, and its leaders need to know how to manage international stores and trade. The company can use its strengths, like its existing international stores and successful US operations, to make this strategy work. By doing so, 7-Eleven can earn more money than usual.",
    "Considering Iceland's approach to mitigating the effects of coronavirus is an interesting strategy, despite its limitations, such as community resilience and geographical uniqueness. However, this approach may not be effective in NATO countries with high infection rates. Quick response and high testing rates are crucial, but they require population cooperation and significant financial resources. Some NATO countries may struggle to afford the high cost of testing, especially if the virus spreads across multiple countries simultaneously.\n\nAn alternative approach is digital epidemiological investigation, as seen in Israel, which tracks potential contacts of infected individuals. While this method may not overcome geographical limitations, digital tracking could replace strict border control and enable timely responses to new outbreaks. However, implementing this solution would require significant internal and external funding to build or reconstruct infrastructure.",
    "The Canadian perspective on the North Atlantic Council's provisional agenda effectively addresses key security concerns for Canada. Notably, it emphasizes the importance of increasing Canada's presence in global peace operations and maintaining strong relationships with other NATO member countries. The \"smart defense\" approach, which considers both military and economic needs, is particularly noteworthy. However, it is challenging to assess the extent to which the Syrian threat affects Canadian interests, especially during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, it is crucial to review the proposed approach to better defend Canadian interests.\n\nThis initiative also serves the interests of both Israel and Canada, which will likely have a positive impact on their bilateral relationship. Additionally, Canada's willingness to cooperate with the withdrawal of troops from Iraq, if officially requested, demonstrates its commitment to humanitarianism. While the extent of this image improvement is uncertain, it is clear that building strong trading relationships and close ties with other NATO countries is a vital aspect of this initiative.\n\nIsrael, in particular, has faced diverse security threats over the decades, including terrorism, missiles, and nuclear dangers. Despite the absence of a national security strategy since 1953, Israel has formed strong political and military bonds with powerful countries like the USA, China, Russia, Germany, Canada, Poland, and India. As a result, Israel has become a significant regional power and continues to thrive due to its seven-decade-old strategy.",
    "The root of Nike's problem lies in its corrupt corporate culture, which perpetuates the marginalization of women. This culture allows powerful men to abuse and suppress women, preventing them from advancing in their careers without facing harassment or denigration. To address this issue, there are four possible approaches: absolving, solving, resolving, and dissolving (Ackoff, 2019). Given the scope and long-term goals of Nike and society, the only viable solution is to dissolve the problem by removing its underlying causes.\n\nAbsolving means ignoring the problem, solving involves providing compensation to victims without making systemic changes, and resolving means empowering women to fight back without addressing the toxic culture (Singh, 2018). However, simply enabling women to fight back is insufficient; Nike must create an environment where they do not have to.\n\nFrom an organizational perspective, transforming Nike's culture requires a comprehensive overhaul from top to bottom. If harassment, cronyism, and corruption are tolerated at the top, they will inevitably permeate the entire organization (Singh, 2018). Therefore, Nike's leadership, including Parker, must implement policies and solutions at all levels to disincentivize such behavior and eliminate its sources.\n\nThe proposed plan of action involves conducting a thorough review of every employee and manager to determine their involvement in the perpetuation of Nike's toxic culture. Those found complicit, including Parker and the board members who have benefited from the system, must be removed from the company. A new leadership team would then implement a culture based on equality, capability, and diversity, ensuring that women are valued and empowered to succeed.",
    "The big differences in wealth and opportunities in American society have affected unemployment rates even before the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic made things worse. During the pandemic, there were two different experiences: people with college degrees who could work from home and keep their jobs, and those who lost their jobs or had their hours cut with no safety net.\n\nThe main reasons why some people have jobs and others don't are power and privilege, which are not shared equally among different racial, gender, and education groups. The biggest difference is between those who have a college education and those who don't.\n\nRace and ethnicity are also big factors in who gets access to education and jobs. Black people face racism in many areas of life, including when they're looking for a job or a place to live, which makes it harder for them to get ahead.\n\nThe pandemic made these problems worse, and it's clear when we look at how different groups are recovering. The overall unemployment rate has gone down, but black people are still struggling more than others. In April 2020, the unemployment rate for black people was 16.8%, and it's still higher than average today. This is because they often don't have the same access to education, stable jobs, and support networks as others.\n\nIn short, the pandemic has made it clear that some groups are struggling more than others to find jobs and recover from the pandemic.",
    "James Brown was a prominent figure in soul music, achieving success in 1956 with \"Please Please Please.\" Initially influenced by 1950s doo-wop, Brown developed his unique soul style in the 1960s, characterized by horns and a driving rhythm section. He took control of his music, combining aggressive vocals and dance performance with production skills and business acumen. Brown's style evolved over the 1960s and 1970s, distinguishing him from Motown, Stax, and Atlantic artists. His music, such as \"Papa's Got a Brand New Bag, Pt. 1,\" featured distinctive elements like stops at the end of verses and no background vocals. Brown's music was highly popular in the Black community, expressing racial pride through his hard-edged style and political lyrics. He was a passionate performer who hired top musicians and rehearsed them tirelessly, leaving a lasting impact on the music industry.",
    "Janina's language in Drive Your Plow over the Bones of the Dead is distinctive, not only in its unraveling of the mystery surrounding the murders but also in its revelation of her personality. One of the most striking aspects of her language is her use of nicknames as substitutes for people's and animals' names. While many people use nicknames for friends or those they dislike, Janina's approach is rooted in her feelings about names and their significance. She believes that each person sees others in their own way, and therefore, should give them a name that suits their perception. This philosophy leads her to assign nicknames to every character she encounters, transforming each person into the characteristic she sees in them. For instance, her friend becomes \"Oddball,\" implying that they may be strange in some way, even if this perception is not entirely accurate. Similarly, the murder victims are dubbed \"Big Foot,\" \"Commandant,\" and \"Inner,\" reflecting the traits of appearance or status that Janina associates with them. In contrast, when considering a name for a rescue dog, Janina's first suggestion is the human name \"Marysia,\" which she deems suitable based on the dog's personal history and story. This contrast between the names and nicknames Janina uses for people and animals reveals her underlying values. She has a deep affection for animals, while humans are often judged or excluded for their perceived oddities. Through her narrative, Janina's untrustworthy nature is laid bare, exposing her potential role in the murders and her tendency to judge people based on their treatment of animals, whom she perceives as more worthy of saving than humans.",
    "Meet John Smeaton, the trailblazing English engineer who revolutionized the way we design bridges, canals, and lighthouses! In a fascinating article by Andrew M. A. Morris, we discover how Smeaton's innovative approach to parameter variation transformed the engineering landscape (Morris, 2021). Morris highlights the three key objectives of this groundbreaking process: optimization, theory testing, and maxim development through exploratory testing. As Morris so aptly puts it, Smeaton's method wasn't just about streamlining engineering processes; it was a game-changer that bridged the gap between science and technology by combining theoretical and practical testing (Morris, 2021). I wholeheartedly agree with Morris that Smeaton's pioneering work involved hypothesis testing, empirical experimentation, and the development of his own maxims.\n\nBut that's not all! Morris also sheds light on the dynamic relationship between science and technology during the Industrial Revolution. He challenges the conventional view shaped by outdated historical studies, which pitted science against technology (Morris, 2021). I firmly believe that the Industrial Revolution was a perfect storm of technological innovation, scientific discovery, and industrial progress. The era saw monumental breakthroughs that transformed every aspect of our lives and spawned new fields of study. Who can forget the early days of harnessing natural energy sources like wind and water to generate electricity? And later, pioneers like John Smeaton, who improved steam power and harnessed electricity to propel the Industrial Revolution forward? It's clear that science, technology, and industry were intertwined, driving progress and shaping our modern world!",
    "Washington state has one of the lowest uninsured rates in the country, with only 6.6% of the population uninsured as of 2019, compared to 14.9% in Oklahoma and 18.4% in Texas (Kaiser Family Foundation, n.d.). This is likely due to the strong connection between socioeconomic status and access to care. Those with lower incomes are more likely to be uninsured or rely on Medicaid, leading to delayed or foregone care. In contrast, Washington state's strong job market and high level of health literacy enable residents to afford and access quality healthcare. The state's numerous healthcare facilities and welcoming community also contribute to its high insured rate. However, ethnic disparities, access to education, and community context can still create gaps in care, particularly in other parts of the country where prejudice and limited opportunities may hinder access to quality education and healthcare.",
    "Kantian ethics stands out as a prime example of non-consequentialist theories in both philosophy and law. Interestingly, proponents of utilitarianism, which emphasizes social order, often find themselves drawn to this theory. At the heart of Kant's philosophy lies the concept of the categorical imperative, which exemplifies non-consequential ethics. This concept, as Kant envisioned it, outlines how individuals should behave in order to exhibit genuinely moral conduct (Kant & Abbott, 2021). The imperative directly addresses the individual, who makes moral choices based on predetermined rational principles. It urges individuals to carefully examine the maxims guiding their behavior, adhering to the subjective rules of practical reason. According to Kant, the principles of pure practical reason take on a distinct non-consequential form (Kant & Abbott, 2021). These principles are statements that define the will, subject to various practical rules, which raises inherent problems. A closer examination of Kant's understanding of ethics is warranted. Specifically, he argues that morality must be absolute and universal, rather than relative and bound by personal interests; otherwise, it loses all meaning (Kant & Abbott, 2021). In other words, relativism is the antithesis of genuine morality, as it undermines the universality of moral principles and adapts to circumstances. This tension between the universal moral law, which Kant advocates for, and the specific circumstances of individual actions, is a central conflict in his non-consequential ethical stance. After all, individuals cannot help but act based on their circumstances, forming their own subjective maxims of behavior. Perhaps they have no reason to be guided by universal morality, rendering the universal moral law – the categorical imperative – a mere idea or illusion.",
    "Labor racketeering is the illegal use of unions and authority for personal gain. This form of corruption is often perpetrated by, in collaboration with, or under the direction of organized criminal syndicates. The early 20th century laid the groundwork for labor racketeering, which became a significant legal and societal concern (Jacobs, 2020). However, until the late 1970s and early 1980s, there was no systematic effort by government agencies or law enforcement to address the issue (Jacobs, 2020).\n\nDuring Prohibition, criminal groups profited from selling illegal liquor, maintaining high demand and earnings. When Prohibition was repealed in the 1930s, the mafia's advanced business methods remained (Jacobs, 2020). The most powerful groups shifted their focus from alcohol to other lucrative businesses, including narcotics, gambling, and prostitution (Jacobs, 2020). Labor racketeering, through the control of labor unions, was another profitable venture for organized crime.\n\nGangs preferred labor unions due to their access to legitimate businesses, such as waste management, construction, and demolition (Jacobs, 2020). They also had easy access to healthcare and pension funds from the unions. These legitimate businesses provided a cover for their illegal activities, including drug trafficking and extortion (Jacobs, 2020). Organized crime groups also engaged in extortion, bribery, and other crimes to expand their influence.\n\nThe main activities of gangs included prostitution, drug trafficking, gambling, and labor racketeering. Labor unions were attractive to organized crime due to the access they provided to legitimate businesses. By controlling labor unions, mobsters could infiltrate demolition, construction, and waste management industries, further diversifying their profits.",
    "When it comes to studying language, there are many different approaches scientists take. One of them is the prescriptive method, which is all about setting rules for how we should speak and write. According to Crystal (1987), this approach chooses one way of interpreting a language as the standard and applies it to everyone. You usually see this in formal speech and literature.\n\nOn the other hand, there's the descriptive approach, which focuses on how language is actually used, rather than how it should be used. This method is all about observing and describing the many variations of language, without being tied to any official framework. Crystal (1987) notes that these two approaches are often seen as opposites, but they can both be useful in different contexts.\n\nThe problem is, when we explore these methods, we often end up with an unrealistic view of the other side, which can lead to prejudice and conflict. But the truth is, both approaches have their strengths, and we can learn from each other. The prescriptive approach helps us design a more organized society, while the descriptive approach lets us track real language changes. By combining the two, we can find a balance between logic and the natural way things work.\n\nOf course, not everyone is happy with language changes. Some people think that change means deterioration, and that's often because they're stuck in their ways. Crystal (1987) points out that this is nothing new - older generations have always complained about changes in language. And it's not necessarily true that language changes are linked to a decline in education quality or the negative influence of the media.\n\nIn fact, language change is a natural process that happens alongside society and its progressive members. It's not something we can control or dictate. So, I agree with Crystal (1987) that people are often just afraid of change, and that's what drives their resistance to language evolution.",
    "The shift in the global management paradigm has significantly impacted the leadership process, a crucial component of management. The rapid technological and information revolution has enabled most businesses to expand their operations globally, presenting leaders with both opportunities and challenges. On one hand, they can now access global markets, but on the other hand, they must adapt their business strategies to compete with an unlimited number of competitors at every stage of development. This underscores the primary requirement for future business leaders: a company mission that does not aim for global leadership is unlikely to succeed.\n\nTo achieve global leadership, leaders must possess cultural management skills, recognizing that cultural differences significantly influence their behavior and actions. These differences are often reflected in how they allocate working time, make decisions, and motivate their teams. Effective leadership is a critical element in international relations, shaping the course of global political and economic processes.\n\nResearch emphasizes the importance of developing a global mindset in leaders. According to Ratanjee (2021), exposing leaders to multicultural experiences is gaining increasing attention, as it enables them to navigate diverse cultural contexts (pp. 2). Moreover, Bonsu and Evans (2018) argue that embracing cross-cultural transformational leadership is vital for business growth in today's era of globalization, technological advancements, and equal access to education and skills (p. 50).\n\nTransformational leaders, characterized by their discernment and charisma, inspire others to re-evaluate their expectations and motivations, driving them towards higher goals. By adopting a transformational leadership approach, future leaders can effectively navigate the complexities of global markets, foster a culture of innovation, and ultimately, achieve sustainable success.",
    "The distinction between goals and objectives is often overlooked, despite their differing effects, timeframes, and levels of specificity. According to Nickels et al. (2019), goals are defined as broad, long-term outcomes that an organization strives to achieve, whereas objectives are measurable, specific, and short-term strategies designed to attain these goals. For instance, the criminal justice system employs goals to guide the police, correctional agencies, and the court in their strategies, including deterrence, rehabilitation, retribution, restoration, and incapacitation. Consequently, the criminal justice system prioritizes the protection of individuals' rights through its objectives. In an era characterized by rapid change, diversity, and complexity, effective leadership and management are crucial to the survival of any agency. Moreover, the ability to lead and manage permeates every aspect of the criminal justice system. Leaders provide vision and direction, while managers implement coordinated processes and structures to pursue organizational goals and objectives (Nickels et al., 2019). Leaders are continually challenged to take calculated risks and drive transformation. In law enforcement, for example, police leaders must establish and instill high standards among their officers to work towards a common goal. Beyond leadership, criminal justice relies on managers to optimize processes and drive efforts towards reliable outcomes. Generally, criminal justice leaders and managers work to strike a balance between ethical and legal considerations. Pursuing a degree in criminal justice would significantly contribute to achieving my long-term goals. As a leader, I have always taken pride in driving change. However, I must leverage my education with experience in the criminal justice system to enhance my efficiency and productivity. The criminal justice system is becoming increasingly complex and requires more sustainable and transformative approaches. Therefore, my second goal is to become more adaptable to change. Developing robust analytical skills to drive meaningful change is an objective in itself. Additionally, acquiring strong relational skills to collaborate with professionals and serve diverse populations is essential.",
    "A powerful statement from Isaiah in the video resonated with me: Samuel's experience taught him that even when sitting down, one person can play t-ball and hit it hard. This simple yet profound message highlights how good intentions can still lead to prejudice. Before Samuel's birth, his family was unaware of the daily struggles faced by people with disabilities (PinehurstPictures, 2010). The image of Samuel hitting a t-ball while seated drives home a crucial point: individuals with disabilities deserve equal opportunities to thrive and reach their full potential.\n\nI was inspired by the story of Nathanial Orellana, who learns alongside his peers in a regular classroom. His mother's determination to find the right school for his autism is a testament to the extra challenges parents of disabled children face in providing them with the best possible care (PinehurstPictures, 2010). The video underscores the need for communities and governments to offer a range of schools that cater to different disabilities, allowing parents to choose the best fit for their child.\n\nMoreover, the video emphasizes the importance of social interaction for children with disabilities. While they require special care, they should be allowed to engage with others if their condition permits. Engagement is a vital tool for child development, fostering attentiveness, activity, and enthusiasm, which in turn lead to greater achievement. Nathanial's eagerness to answer a question in class is a perfect example of this.\n\nThe video also sheds light on the daily struggles of individuals with disabilities, highlighting the need for greater understanding and support. Emily, a mental health advocate with schizophrenia, poignantly notes that those without the condition cannot fully comprehend the challenges faced by those who do (PinehurstPictures, 2010). It is essential for society to recognize these challenges and work towards creating an inclusive environment that allows individuals with disabilities to thrive.\n\nKeith Jones' insight is equally important: expecting children to develop good social skills without adequate interaction is unrealistic. Inclusion can only work if children are given frequent opportunities to interact with one another, despite their differences. By recognizing and addressing these issues, we can create a more inclusive and supportive society for all.",
    "The article's main argument is supported by the story of Professor Wilson, who made a surprising change in his lifestyle. He decided to live in a dumpster to achieve maximum sustainability in a small space. What's interesting is that he even invites his ecology-focused students to stay with him in the dumpster at night. The article caught my attention for a few reasons. Firstly, the idea of a respected professor living in a dumpster reminded me of the ancient Greek philosopher Diogenes, who lived in a barrel. I was curious to see if there were any similarities between the two. Additionally, the article shared personal details about Professor Wilson, including his divorce, which added a psychological layer to the story. I wondered if the divorce had a significant impact on him, leading him to make such a drastic change. The article's visuals were also crucial in keeping my interest. When I started reading, I was feeling tired, but the pictures of the dumpster, daily activities, and its interior helped me relax and think about the topic. The pictures raised questions in my mind, which motivated me to read on and find the answers. Surprisingly, the interior of the dumpster didn't look bad, and Professor Wilson seemed comfortable living there. While living in a dumpster might be an option for me when I need some alone time, I couldn't imagine doing it permanently due to the lack of basic amenities like a kitchen and bathroom.",
    "Lookism and extreme body modification are both rooted in unhealthy and unrealistic beauty standards in modern society. While they share this common thread, they have distinct differences in their manifestations and consequences.\n\nLookism is the act of judging someone as unattractive based on societal beauty standards. It involves criticizing others who don't fit the norm, and is an outward-facing behavior.\n\nExtreme body modification, on the other hand, involves changing one's body to deviate from societal appearance norms. This can be done intentionally to stand out or to conform to cultural or social expectations.\n\nThe key difference between the two lies in their focus: lookism focuses on others, while extreme body modification focuses on oneself. Lookism often stems from deep-seated insecurity about one's own beauty, leading to a critical attitude towards others. This can be a sign of an unhealthy relationship with self-image.\n\nIn contrast, extreme body modification can be a personal choice or a response to social pressure. Historically, women have been disproportionately expected to conform to these beauty standards, such as the ancient Chinese practice of foot binding, in order to maintain respectability and marital value.",
    "Nicholas Machiavelli's \"The Prince\" is a groundbreaking work that challenges traditional political thought. Unlike ancient philosophers who idealized governments and utopian cities, Machiavelli focuses on the harsh realities of politics, where rulers must make tough decisions and prioritize their own survival. The book's main theme is monarchical rule and how to maintain power, often through ruthless and cunning means. Machiavelli argues that the primary goal of politics is to retain power, and he provides guidance on how rulers should act in different situations. This approach opposes the traditional view that politics should serve the people, instead promoting a self-centered approach where the ruler's goals come first. The book has had a lasting impact on political thought, but its justification of any means to achieve power has been criticized. In contrast, Thomas Hobbes' view that people are driven by egoism and self-interest is also overly simplistic. Human nature is more complex, and many people engage in altruistic acts without expecting personal gain.",
    "The concept of organizational culture can be understood through different levels and dimensions. According to Edgar Schein and Edward Granter, there are four distinct levels of culture within an organization: super-structural, symbolic, discursive, and cognitive (Granter, 2019). These levels are shaped by external economic and social influences, as well as internal factors such as artifacts, values, and underlying assumptions.\n\nThis paper examines the levels of organizational culture at Macomb Community College. At the artifact level, the college's logo and architecture convey a sense of concentration, attentiveness, and responsibility. The modern, high-tech buildings suggest a focus on technology and science, while the older central building and park create a more introspective atmosphere, suitable for fine arts and social sciences. The college's bus route system also reflects its commitment to community relations and mutual help.\n\nAt the value level, signs throughout the college emphasize order and organization, indicating that teachers value composure and commitment from students. However, at the assumption level, the college may be overly cautious in accepting students who are self-expressive or tied to popular culture. The college website's lack of flashy headlines and frivolous programs suggests a more serious and focused approach.\n\nThis analysis reveals that Macomb Community College has a clear identity at the artifact and value levels. However, it also suggests that the college may benefit from reevaluating its underlying assumptions. By embracing openness in relationships and avoiding harsh judgments, the college can foster stronger social connections and community values.",
    "The story of King Gilgamesh is the oldest known story about the relationship between humans and gods. It's about how King Gilgamesh, who was two-thirds god and one-third human, changed from being a mean ruler to a kind one when he faced death. This story is over 4,000 years old, even older than the Bible. King Gilgamesh was special, but the gods got tired of his arrogance and sent a friend, Enkidu, to teach him a lesson. Enkidu was created by the gods, just like Adam, and was made human by a prostitute. However, Enkidu died because of a mistake, and King Gilgamesh was devastated. He then searched for a way to live forever, but eventually realized that only gods can live forever, and humans will always die. In the end, King Gilgamesh learned to appreciate his life and the people in his city. The story of King Gilgamesh has been remembered for thousands of years because of its powerful message about the importance of human relationships and the reality of death.",
    "Employee motivation is crucial for a company's success. Managers must monitor and direct workers to achieve goals, as motivation is key to inducing individuals to work to their full potential. There are several reasons why managers should prioritize employee motivation:\n\n* Individual success depends on talent and inspiration, which can be influenced by education, expertise, and learning.\n* A lack of motivation can lead to lower output, defective manufacturing, and other problems.\n* Managers rely on their staff to complete tasks and achieve objectives, so they must be able to identify decreasing engagement and improve morale.\n* Understanding fundamental human nature is essential for successful employee motivation and good management.\n* If personnel are not fully committed, a business is unlikely to fulfill its goals, leading to a decline in determination, innovation, and productivity.\n* Managers must be familiar with motivational strategies and understand their workers' unique needs and views to select effective incentives and achieve the organization's goals.\n\nOverall, managers have a responsibility to prioritize employee motivation to ensure the success of their company.",

    "Imagine a world where products have more power over people than people have over products. This is the eerie reality that Marx's groundbreaking thesis on the fetishism of commodities reveals. By assigning value to commodities based on the labor that goes into them, we unwittingly surrender to the dominance of goods over human lives. The consequences are far-reaching: social interactions between customers and producers become mere transactions, stripped of human connection and purpose. The valued objects are exchanged like pawns, devoid of any consideration for human needs or desires.\n\nBut what drives this phenomenon? Marx's thesis suggests that we have an innate tendency to fetishize commodities, devoting ourselves to their perceived value rather than their true worth. In today's society, we see this play out in our obsession with technological trends. Take Apple products, for instance. We covet them for their \"high-quality\" and \"accessibility,\" often turning a blind eye to the questionable labor practices that go into creating them. The more labor that goes into producing these items, the more value we assign to them, regardless of their actual quality. It's a vicious cycle where the product's value is dictated by marketing strategies and public perception, rather than its inherent worth.\n\nBut there's a darker side to this phenomenon. The workers who toil behind the scenes to create these coveted products become commodities themselves, mere cogs in the machine of capitalist production. As Marx and Engels so astutely observed in the Manifesto of the Communist Party, this is a system that reduces human beings to mere objects, stripping them of their dignity and autonomy.\n\nWhile Marx's thesis provides a powerful framework for understanding the ills of modern capitalism, it's not without its limitations. One glaring omission is the failure to explore how commodities derive their value from the labor that goes into them. This oversight is a critical weakness, as it neglects a crucial perspective that could help us challenge the materialistic values that govern our society.\n\nDespite these limitations, Marx's work remains a powerful tool for analyzing the socio-economic relations that shape our world. By understanding the fetishism of commodities, we can begin to challenge the dominant ideologies that govern our lives and strive for a more equitable, human-centered society.",
    "Mary Breckinridge was a remarkable individual who dedicated her life to helping others, despite facing immense personal tragedy. Her contributions to nursing and medical research have had a lasting impact. Born on February 17, 1881, in Memphis, Tennessee, Mary's life was marked by loss and hardship. After her first husband's death in 1904, she became a nurse, and later, after the loss of her children, she devoted herself to saving lives. During World War I, she volunteered as a nurse, and later, she established the Frontier Nursing Service (FNC) in 1925, significantly reducing maternal and infant mortality in Kentucky.\n\nMary's achievements are impressive: she introduced nurse-midwifery to the United States, and her organization, FNC, continues to operate in southeastern Kentucky. Her impact on midwifery and nursing education extends beyond her lifetime, with people from around the world studying her model of rural health and social service delivery at the FNC School of Midwifery and Family Nursing.\n\nMary's story is a testament to her strength and resilience. Despite facing unimaginable tragedy, she refused to let her spirit break. Instead, she channeled her energy into reducing suffering in others' lives. Her example is a powerful reminder that we can all make a difference, even in the face of adversity.",
    "The introduction of advanced nursing education levels has significantly contributed to the complexity of the field. Historically, nursing schools offered Bachelor's degrees that provided students with the foundational skills required for the profession. However, modern nursing students now have access to high-quality Master's programs that further enhance their skills and competencies. This raises the question of the value of these advanced degrees. In reality, Master's programs in nursing are crucial for healthcare, as they align with the growing importance of nurses and the contemporary healthcare system.\n\nWhile Bachelor's degrees provide students with the fundamental concepts and practical skills necessary to become a competent nurse, Master's programs serve as a catalyst for those who want to engage with more advanced principles of 21st-century nursing. Master's degrees focus on developing critical thinking and cognitive agility, enabling nurses to make precise decisions in complex situations and take on leadership roles in healthcare decision-making. Additionally, these programs foster emotional intelligence, which is essential for patient-centered care, and promote proficiency in scientific research, ultimately contributing to the development of nursing leaders within the professional community.\n\nOverall, Master's programs in nursing complement the fundamental skills of each professional by introducing stronger cognitive, emotional, and research competencies, ultimately supporting the emergence of nursing leaders who can drive positive change in the healthcare system.",
    "According to Mearsheimer, the distribution of power among states is a key factor in determining the likelihood of war in modern Europe. He argues that a multipolar system, where power is not evenly distributed, is the most prone to rivalry and instability, leading to frequent wars. This is because the constantly shifting relationships between countries make it difficult for states to accurately assess each other's capabilities and intentions. In an unbalanced multipolar system, a hegemon's pursuit of power can lead to aggressive policies from other states. In contrast, a bipolar system, where power is more evenly balanced, is more stable and conducive to mutual understanding, resulting in fewer wars. However, Mearsheimer's theory may not be applicable to the current world order, which is characterized by a complex interplay between multipolarity and bipolarity. Moreover, the presence of nuclear weapons, which was a significant factor in maintaining peace in bipolar Europe between 1945 and 1990, cannot be ignored. Mearsheimer suggests that the fear of nuclear annihilation may be a more significant deterrent to war than the balance of power. Therefore, it is overly simplistic to attribute the causes of war solely to a particular system of power distribution.",
    "Melanoma is a type of cancer that has seen a significant increase in treatment success rates, often diagnosed in its early stages. Until recently, treatment options for patients with metastatic melanoma were limited, leaving many with a poor prognosis. However, the development of immune checkpoint inhibitors over the past decade has revolutionized melanoma treatment. As a result, patients with stages II and III melanoma can now experience extended periods of remission. Modern melanoma treatment options offer new hope for many individuals. The key to these advancements lies in the use of checkpoint inhibitors and adjuvant therapy. Research has shown that the combination of anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD1 immune checkpoint inhibitors, along with BRAF/MEK inhibitors for patients with BRAF V600 mutations, has significantly improved survival rates and enabled some patients to achieve durable disease remission without ongoing treatment (Poklepovic & Luke, 2019). This means that patients with \"low-risk\" stage IIA through IIC melanoma, like Mr. B, can experience long-term remission with targeted treatment. Even in remission, patients should continue to prioritize their health with adjuvant therapies. In the past, adjuvant therapies were often viewed as having limited benefits for early-stage melanoma due to the toxicity associated with treatments like interferon-α2b (IFN) and the anti-CTLA4 antibody ipilimumab (Jenkins & Fisher, 2021). However, with time, adjuvant therapies have become a crucial component of cancer treatment. In Mr. B's case, adjuvant therapy may have prevented the recurrence of stage II melanoma.",
    "While the concept of mentoring is relatively recent in church circles, it has been a widespread practice in Christian communities for years. Many churches have informally adopted spiritual guidance, leadership development, discipleship, and friendship, highlighting the need for standardized skills and methods to ensure better outcomes. According to Mallison (1998), Christian coaching involves nurturing disciples and leaders through guidance and encouragement rooted in God's will and biblical principles. Mallison defines Christian mentoring as \"a purposeful, trusting relationship where one person empowers another to fully utilize God's grace in their life and service\" (Mallison, 1998, p. 8). The author's primary emphasis is that mentorship is essential for Christian growth and that taking an interest in others' progress is crucial. Christian-based mentoring incorporates various spiritual elements, aspects, and the Bible as its core components. By presenting Jesus as the ultimate mentoring model, Mallison's central argument is that Christians should prioritize the spiritual and personal growth of others, as Christianity is inherently relational and collectivist. The author stresses the importance of community and interdependence, citing that a Christian attempting to live in isolation is like \"a pious particle\" (Mallison, 1998, p. 34). However, the author also notes that Christian mentoring is futile without a genuine desire to see the mentee's spiritual growth. Developing an interest in others' spiritual and personal growth is essential for Christians seeking deeper spirituality. For instance, Christian fellowships should assign responsible and dependable individuals to mentor new disciples due to their reliability and genuine concern for the mentees' progress (Mallison, 1998). A key implication of the publication is the critical need for a properly structured and biblically inspired coaching program. This implies that Christian mentorship models should produce disciples and leaders who will continue to spread the gospel. Notable criticisms of the book include its exclusive reliance on the Bible as a source of information and limited exploration of the relationships between spiritual friends, spiritual directors, and mentors, as well as the absence of discussions on mentor damage. The author reinforces his views by drawing comparisons from other works and extensively integrating biblical insights. A question arising from the publication is how the Christian model of mentoring can address destructive coaching practices.",
    "Examining the rhetorical strategies employed by influential figures in their public addresses can yield valuable insights. By analyzing these techniques, individuals can gain a deeper understanding of the when, where, and how of effective communication. This study delves into Michelle Obama's keynote speech at the White House Convention on Food Marketing to Children, where she passionately advocated for curbing the promotion of unhealthy food to minors. Obama's persuasive approach is characterized by a dual emphasis on logical reasoning and emotional appeal. One notable instance of logical rhetoric is her citation of empirical evidence, such as the decline in obesity rates among low-income preschoolers between 2008 and 2011, to justify the need for responsible television programming that promotes healthy lifestyles among children. Furthermore, Obama's emotional appeal is evident in her poignant reminder that despite progress, one in three kids remains at risk of developing diabetes, underscoring the urgency of the issue. This analysis of Michelle Obama's speech highlights the strategic deployment of logical and emotional rhetorical devices to convey a compelling message, ultimately enhancing the persuasive power of her address.",
    "In recent decades, globalization has emerged as a dominant trend in shaping geopolitical and cultural practices. The internet has bridged the gap between people across continents, leading to a convergence of cultures. As a result, a shared culture has begun to take shape, accommodating diverse traditions from around the world. However, this integration is not without its challenges. Stronger national cultures often overshadow weaker ones, leading to a loss of cultural identity. This has sparked a rise in nationalistic sentiments among communities that feel their cultures are being threatened. The spread of dominant cultural influences, such as the American dream, can also lead to cultural indifference among people from other regions. Furthermore, globalization can pose a threat to the sovereignty of vulnerable communities, as powerful nations may suppress the development of smaller neighboring ones. While a healthy dose of nationalism can be beneficial for communities seeking to preserve their independence, radical and violent nationalism can lead to international conflicts and hinder globalization. Rather than viewing globalization as inherently good or bad, it should be recognized as a natural step in human evolution. With its advantages and disadvantages, globalization has created a highly interconnected world where individuals can access global news, music, and literature in an instant, giving rise to a new shared culture. However, radical nationalism remains a pressing issue that societies and governments must address.",
    "The question of what it means to be human is inherently complex and multifaceted. Some individuals might argue that humanity is characterized by autonomy and self-determination, whereas others might contend that it is defined by our capacity to harness the refinements of civilization, such as donning attire and engaging in daily labor, thereby distinguishing ourselves from the animal kingdom. However, the notion of how people desire to live is equally nuanced, as each individual possesses unique requirements, aspirations, and perspectives on this matter. This essay serves as a reflection on the On Being podcast, which endeavors to provide insight into these very questions.\n\nIn the podcast, the venerable Thich Nhat Hanh offers a profound perspective on the importance of remaining human. According to Hanh, \"we have to remain human to be able to understand and to be compassionate\" (Onbeing.org 30:53 – 30:58). The monk further elucidates that being human entails the freedom to err, but not the license to perpetuate mistakes (Onbeing.org 31:15 – 31:20). Thus, humanity is inextricably linked with mindfulness, responsibility, and open-heartedness. In essence, being human is synonymous with being humane.\n\nIn a world beset by violence and terror, where effective communication has become an anomaly, individuals often struggle to discern a genuine way of living (Onbeing.org). It can be inferred from Hanh's words that people aspire to live without anger, cultivating mindfulness and emotional control. However, this idealized existence often eludes the average modern individual. Nonetheless, the podcast is profoundly inspiring, as it delves into the complexities of being human, the challenges of modern life, and the strategies for overcoming them. Thich Nhat Hanh's thoughtful and introspective demeanor leaves an indelible impression, rendering his ideas worthy of serious consideration. Although I do not subscribe to the Buddhist worldview, I have immense admiration for Hanh's persona, which has inspired me to explore mindfulness practices further.",
    "Daniel Lerner's book \"The Passing of Traditional Societies\" is based on research conducted over 10 years in six Middle Eastern countries. Lerner argues that all societies follow the same path of modernization, which was initially set by Western countries. However, he believes that this \"Western model\" is actually a global phenomenon that happened to start in Western countries due to historical circumstances. Lerner's research focuses on how modernization changes people's lifestyles, particularly in terms of population mobility, literacy, and mass media. He identifies ethnocentrism as a major obstacle to modernization and suggests that a focus on cultural identity can hinder progress. Lerner's modernization theory, developed in the post-World War II era, aims to help countries transition from \"backwardness\" to \"modernity.\" However, this theory has been criticized for oversimplifying the historical process and not being applicable to countries like China, Russia, or Cuba, making it less relevant today.",
    "**Understanding Competition in the Fashion and Steel Industries**\n\nImagine you're shopping for clothes or looking for a steel supplier. Have you ever wondered how companies in these industries compete with each other? Let's break it down.\n\n**Fashion Industry: Many Players, Unique Selling Points**\n\nThe fashion industry is a crowded market with many companies producing similar products. To stand out, companies use branding, advertising, and product differentiation. This means they focus on unique designs, high-quality materials, and competitive pricing. Advertisements highlight physical differences like color, style, and size, as well as intangible benefits like money-back guarantees, free delivery, and long-lasting wear.\n\n**Steel Industry: A Few Big Players Call the Shots**\n\nIn contrast, the steel industry is dominated by a few large companies. These industry leaders set prices and trends, and often collaborate to stay ahead. To differentiate themselves, they focus on improving product quality, adjusting prices, and highlighting special features. If one leading company lowers prices, others don't necessarily follow suit. Instead, they focus on producing high-quality products to maintain their premium pricing. These industry leaders also set high standards to discourage new companies from entering the market. They achieve this by producing high-quality products, selling them at a higher price, and manufacturing large quantities.\n\nBy understanding how companies compete in these industries, we can appreciate the strategies they use to stay ahead of the game.",
    "When it comes to morality, two dominant theories emerge: moral relativism and moral universalism. Moral relativism posits that morality is shaped by individual experiences, cultural norms, and personal sensations, rather than a universal standard. In contrast, moral universalism roots morality in human nature, emphasizing our capacity for empathy, rational argumentation, and the need for shared moral principles.\n\nWhile moral relativism may seem appealing, it's plagued by inconsistencies. For instance, relativist arguments often imply that there's a universal moral framework that should be followed, which contradicts the core idea of relativism. Moreover, when relativists argue that different cultures have different values, they inadvertently rely on absolute standards to explain human behavior, ultimately converging with moral universalism.\n\nMoral universalism, on the other hand, proposes that a common ethical system governs human behavior across cultures, races, genders, religions, and other differences. This perspective is supported by the observation that all viable moral codes share a common core: respect for life, health, property, and personal dignity.\n\nMoral universalism appears to be the more convincing theory for two key reasons. Firstly, moral relativism is built on exceptions rather than general rules, whereas human nature provides a foundation for shared moral and ethical codes across cultures. Secondly, if everyone had their own morality and ethics, as relativism suggests, it would be impossible to regulate human relationships and maintain social order. In contrast, moral universalism offers a framework for understanding and navigating complex moral issues.",
    "In \"Interpreter of Maladies,\" Jhumpa Lahiri masterfully crafts a nuanced portrayal of a dysfunctional family, with Mr. Das emerging as a complex and multifaceted character. Initially, Mr. Das elicits both sympathy and a hint of annoyance, which ultimately gives way to disdain as his character evolves. While he appears benevolent and sympathetic at first glance, his inability to form emotional connections with his wife and children underscores the need for personal growth, which unfortunately never materializes.\n\nAt the outset, Mr. Das's kind nature makes him relatable and easy to empathize with. Throughout the novel, he consistently displays a benevolent and kind-hearted demeanor, never exhibiting aggression or unkindness towards his wife. For instance, in a conversation with Mr. Kapasi, he responds calmly, saying, \"But they're harmless\" (Lahiri). However, a closer examination of Mr. Das's character reveals a more nuanced picture. His reluctance to engage with his wife and children becomes apparent, as exemplified by his decision to avoid conversation with Mr. Kapasi, instead opting to immerse himself in a tour book: \"Mr. Das was absorbed by his tour book, so it seemed like a private conversation between Mr. Kapasi and Mrs. Das\" (Lahiri). This deliberate distancing creates a rift in his relationships, highlighting a significant obstacle in his character development.\n\nUltimately, Mr. Das's failure to acknowledge and address the problems in his family relationships prevents him from undergoing any meaningful growth throughout the novel. His willful ignorance of his family's unhappiness strips him of his initial sympathetic appeal, instead rendering him deeply flawed. Although his struggles to understand his marriage and children are relatable and humanizing, his inability or unwillingness to recognize and confront these issues leads to a profound sense of disappointment.\n\nThrough Mr. Das's complex and contradictory character, Lahiri teaches a valuable lesson about the importance of introspection and acknowledging reality. His character arc serves as a poignant reminder that personal growth and development are contingent upon one's ability to confront and address their flaws, rather than turning a blind eye to them.",
    "This article reviews the different methods and criteria used to evaluate and select suppliers, a crucial part of a manufacturing company's success. The industry has shifted its focus from just being efficient to building strategic partnerships. The right approach to evaluating suppliers is key to a company's growth and progress.\n\nThe article explores various ways to address the challenges of selecting the best suppliers. Some common methods include:\n\n* Mathematical models\n* Simple multi-attribute rating technique (SMART)\n* Analytic network process (ANP)\n* Analytic hierarchy process (AHP)\n* Data envelopment analysis (DEA)\n* Linear programming\n\nFor example, DEA evaluates suppliers based on specific criteria and classifies them as efficient or inefficient. Mathematical models compare suppliers and identify the best ones based on cost and other factors.\n\nThe article compares these methods by how often they are mentioned in research papers. DEA is the most popular method, mentioned 30% of the time, followed by mathematical programming, AHP, and case-based reasoning.\n\nIt's important to know which methods are most commonly used, as this can help companies understand the best ways to evaluate and select suppliers. Suppliers should be evaluated based on strategic, functional, and operational factors. Methods like DEA, mathematical programming, and AHP can help identify the best suppliers, while AHP is particularly effective in ensuring consistency.",
    "Ancient Rome was a multicultural society, thanks to its vast territorial control and integration of local populations and cultures. The Roman population exhibited remarkable genetic diversity, with closer ties to Mediterranean states than Western Europe. The empire encompassed various cultures, including the Gauls, Greeks, Syrians, Egyptians, Lebanese, Persians, and others. Rome's cultural and economic success can be attributed to its ability to embrace diverse ethnic and national identities, assimilating elements of foreign cultures into its own traditions and practices. During the Pax Romana, a 200-year period of prosperity and peace, Rome's conquests slowed, and diverse cultures coexisted under a single government. While Rome imposed some values and requirements on its conquered regions, people generally enjoyed autonomy in their daily lives, religions, traditions, and laws. Ancient Greece had a profound influence on Roman culture, shaping its architecture, art, philosophy, and politics. The Romans admired Greek progress and intelligence, building upon their foundation in science, literature, law, economics, and military tactics. The Etruscans, a neighboring tribe, also influenced Rome, facilitating the transition of Greek culture and contributing to Rome's military capabilities and expansionist society.",
    "For centuries, humans have harnessed the power of symbols and myths to convey the essence of a reality that transcends the physical world, passing it down to future generations. Today, iconic brands tap into this magic to create unforgettable products. Take Versace, whose logo - designed by Gianni Versace in 1978 - features the mesmerizing head of Medusa, a symbol of beauty and simplicity. This ancient Greek mythological figure has the power to captivate, just like the brand's stunning clothes.\n\nLamborghini's emblem, the golden bull, is another example. This sacred animal of Zeus represents strength and resilience, fitting for the high-performance supercars that bear its mark. But my personal favorite is the myth of Prometheus, the titan who defied the gods to empower humanity. By stealing sacred fire from Olympus, Prometheus gifted humans with independence, teaching them to write, count, craft, and harness metals. He even showed them how to build ships and master medicine.\n\nHowever, this bravery came at a cost. Zeus punished Prometheus, chaining him to a rock and subjecting him to the elements. But even in torment, Prometheus's spirit remained unbroken. Eventually, Heracles, the strongest of men, freed the titan, killing the eagle that had tortured him and shattering his chains. This timeless myth reminds us that even in darkness, goodness and justice can prevail.",
    "Scandal Rocks McDonald's: Former CEO's Secret Life Exposed\n\nIn a shocking turn of events, McDonald's has filed a lawsuit against its former CEO, Steve Easterbrook, after it was discovered that he had engaged in multiple consensual sexual relationships with employees in the year leading up to his departure. What's even more disturbing is that Easterbrook deliberately concealed the evidence and misled authorities, prioritizing his own interests over the well-being of the company.\n\nBut that's not all - shareholders are now taking the corporation to task for its alleged failure to prevent misconduct and for prioritizing speed over accuracy in addressing the issue. The question on everyone's mind is: how could McDonald's have let this happen?\n\nThe answer lies in negligent recruitment and retention practices. When an employer fails to properly vet a worker, they can be held liable for any harm caused to others. In the case of McDonald's, if they had conducted thorough background checks on Easterbrook, they may have uncovered his questionable behavior before it was too late.\n\nThis is a stark reminder that companies have a responsibility to ensure the safety and well-being of their employees and customers. Negligent hiring practices can have devastating consequences, from culinary errors that put diners' health at risk to violent behavior that endangers colleagues and customers.\n\nThe law is clear: employers can be held accountable for their employees' intentional misconduct. It's time for McDonald's to take responsibility for its failures and to implement stricter hiring practices to prevent similar scandals in the future.",
    "Neil deGrasse Tyson is one of the most fascinating people I've come across. As a renowned astrophysicist and planetary scientist, he shares his knowledge and opinions on various platforms. I find his insights mind-opening and sometimes shocking. I believe he has access to controversial information and unique perspectives that would be fascinating to learn about.\n\nTyson has an impressive educational background, with degrees from Harvard, the University of Texas at Austin, and Columbia University. He was also appointed to the Commission on the Future of the United States Aerospace Industry by the president in the early 2000s.\n\nAs someone who's always been captivated by the mysteries of the universe, I've watched many documentaries, including Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey, which Tyson narrated. I'm convinced that his knowledge goes far beyond what's presented in the documentary.\n\nIf I had the chance to talk to him, I'd ask about his theories on extraterrestrial life and why Earth is the only known planet with life. I'd also ask if he knows about any classified information at NASA. I find Tyson's knowledge and experience inspiring, and I'd love to learn more from him. I'm confident that he has more to share, and I'd gain new insights and perspectives on the cosmos and outer space from our conversation.",
    "It's crucial to recognize that the human brain's tissue is one of the most intricate and complex structures in the body, with a very limited ability to heal and regenerate. The proposed research aims to investigate how neural stem cells can replace and transform into various brain cells, with the ultimate goal of using them for therapeutic purposes. Due to their remarkable ability to rejuvenate and differentiate, neural stem cells hold great promise as a therapeutic approach to slow down or halt the aging process.\n\nOrganization Plan:\n\n1. Introduction\n2. Literature Review\n3. Brain Aging\n4. Neural Stem Cell Differentiation\n5. Regulation of Differentiation\n6. Therapeutic Strategies\n7. Discussion\n8. Conclusion\n\nLiterature Review Part 1:\n\nPreliminary research suggests that a complex system of regulatory steps, involving GABA signaling, governs neural stem cell behavior. Multiple signaling molecules, including Sonic hedgehog, fibroblast growth factor 2, glutamate, and others, play a crucial role in neurogenesis within the ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ). The subgranular zone (SGZ) is another vital germinal region in the adult human brain, with distinct regulatory mechanisms compared to the V-SVZ.\n\nPart 2:\n\nAs stated in a key proposal, \"V-SVZ NSCs are regulated by local signals from their immediate neighbors, as well as by neurotransmitters and factors secreted by distant neurons, the choroid plexus, and vasculature\" (Obernier & Alvarez-Buylla, 2019, p. 1). In essence, cells located at a distance secrete a wide range of signaling molecules to regulate neural stem cell generation, differentiation, and regeneration processes.\n\nSchedule for the Completion of Tasks",
    "The first two American regions settled by English colonists were New England and the Chesapeake Bay. The Chesapeake Bay was colonized by the Virginia Company, a profit-driven joint-stock enterprise. Although they didn't find precious metals, the region became specialized in growing tobacco. The company hired poor English laborers, mostly young single men, to work on tobacco plantations.\n\nIn contrast, the New England colonies were settled by families who wanted to escape persecution and moral decay in England and create a virtuous society. They established a self-sufficient economy of farms, hamlets, and commercial enterprises, rather than cash crop plantations.\n\nReligion played a significant role in both regions, but in different ways. New England colonies were founded with the explicit purpose of creating a perfect Protestant community. In the Chesapeake Bay, the Anglican Church played a role, with proselytism used to establish better relations with Native Americans, as seen in John Rolf's marriage to Pocahontas.",

    "Imagine a world where the discovery of new animal species is a thing of the past. With the alarming rate of extinctions due to environmental changes, it's easy to assume that we've already uncovered all the secrets of the natural world. But, astonishingly, new species are still being discovered at a remarkable rate. One of the most recent and fascinating finds is the Nimba myotis, affectionately known as the fuzzy orange bat.\n\nThis extraordinary creature, identified as a new species just this year (Simmons et al., 2021), boasts vibrant orange fur with striking black pigmentation, making it a standout among its bat brethren. The Nimba myotis calls natural caves home, where it roosts and rests. Like its fellow bats, it employs laryngeal echolocation to navigate and hunt in the dark, but its diet remains a mystery, waiting to be unraveled by scientists (Simmons et al., 2021).\n\nAs a member of the animal kingdom, the Nimba myotis belongs to the mammalian class, specifically the Chiroptera order and Vespertilionidae family (Simmons et al., 2021). Its mammalian characteristics, such as sexual reproduction and multicellularity, solidify its place among the animal kingdom. Moreover, the absence of cell walls in its cells further cements its classification alongside other animal species.\n\nWhat's more, as a bat, the Nimba myotis represents the largest order in the mammal class, second only to rodents (Simmons et al., 2021). The discovery of this remarkable species has shed new light on the fascinating world of bats, and we can't help but wonder what other secrets lie hidden, waiting to be uncovered.",
    "Deep within the ocean's depths, a vast array of marine microbes thrive in staggering numbers. Among the Nitrite-oxidizing bacteria, six dominant species stand out: Nitrotoga, Nitrospira, Nitrolancetus, Nitrospina, Nitrobacter, and Nitrococcus (Han 2). But one species in particular has captured our attention - Nitrobacter, a microscopic marvel that plays a vital role in plant nutrition. As a nitrifying bacterium, Nitrobacter unlocks the secret to releasing nitrogen, a crucial nutrient for plant growth. This paper delves into the fascinating world of Nitrobacter, exploring its unique characteristics and its pivotal position in the ecosystem.\n\nWhat makes Nitrobacter so remarkable is its ability to convert nitrite into nitrates, a process known as nitrification. This intricate dance involves the oxidation of ammonia, made possible by the symbiotic relationship between Nitrobacter and Nitrosomonas (Han 3). To fully appreciate the significance of Nitrobacter, we must first understand the concept of nitrification and the complex operations that drive it. This biological phenomenon, which unfolds in the soil, has far-reaching implications for the natural world.\n\nThe nitrogen cycle, a critical component of biological processes, relies heavily on soil-dwelling bacteria like Nitrobacter to facilitate the transformation of atmospheric nitrogen into a usable form. By virtue of its oxidation activity, Nitrobacter maintains the delicate balance of microorganisms in the soil, ensuring the fertility and health of the ecosystem. As a nitrifying bacterium, Nitrobacter is the unsung hero of plant nutrition, allowing the soil to preserve its auspicious condition and support the growth of lush vegetation. Its importance cannot be overstated - Nitrobacter is, without a doubt, an exceptionally fascinating species of Nitrite-oxidizing bacteria.",
    "Mental disorders, including manias, phobias, and panic attacks, affect millions of people worldwide, causing exhaustion and torment. One of the most prevalent and debilitating mental health conditions is Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), characterized by uncontrollable obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviors. To better understand OCD, let's examine it through the lens of the four D diagnostic indicators.\n\n**Distress**: OCD causes significant emotional pain, forcing individuals to fight intrusive thoughts and perform repetitive, anxiety-reducing behaviors. This leads to high levels of anxiety, depression, and distress, severely impacting daily life.\n\n**Dysfunction**: OCD disrupts daily routines, interfering with work and relationships. Obsessive thoughts trigger panic, while compulsive actions consume hours of time, causing significant dysfunction.\n\n**Danger**: OCD poses a significant threat to individuals, who may experience suicidal thoughts or engage in self-harming behaviors to cope with their obsessive thoughts. While the risk of harm to others is low, the danger to oneself is substantial.\n\n**Deviance**: OCD leads to abnormal thoughts and behaviors, making individuals feel deviant. However, it's essential to recognize that OCD is a treatable condition, and seeking professional help is crucial to overcoming anxiety, stress, and panic. If you're struggling with OCD, don't hesitate to seek medical attention.",

    "A staggering 89% of respondents in a survey on The Effect Of Work Relationships On Organizational Culture And Commitment revealed that communication with colleagues has a profound impact on their overall quality of life (Suhardi, 2020). Moreover, having at least one friend at work fosters a stronger connection to the company, increasing the desire to stay and contribute. Social connections with colleagues not only boost employee engagement but also encourage them to share their ideas and opinions freely, without fear of judgment. \n\nIn a fascinating study, \"Friends (and Sometimes Enemies) With Cognitive Benefits: What Types of Social Interactions Boost Executive Functioning?\" conducted by the University of Michigan, researchers explored the effects of social interactions on cognitive abilities. The experiment involved dividing participants into two groups: one engaged in casual conversations for 10 minutes, while the other group was asked to debate a topic. The results showed that the group that had relaxed conversations performed significantly better in solving cognitive tasks, demonstrating improved executive functions, including planning, concentration, prioritization, and organization – essential skills for success in the workplace.",
    "Osteoarthritis is a widespread and debilitating condition that affects millions of people globally, yet it often receives inadequate attention within the healthcare system. As one of the leading causes of disability among older adults, it results in chronic pain, reduced mobility, and a diminished quality of life. The economic burden of osteoarthritis is staggering, with estimated annual costs of $303 billion in medical expenses and lost productivity (Abramoff & Caldera, 2020). To mitigate its impact, sustained efforts are necessary to prevent its onset, alleviate pain, and restore function. Osteoarthritis is characterized by the progressive deterioration of articular cartilage, which is essential for smooth joint movement and load transmission. Although cartilage has a slow repair rate, even minor injuries can cause significant damage over time. The entire joint structure, including the synovium, ligaments, and subchondral bone, is affected by osteoarthritis. Despite its significant personal, economic, and societal consequences, osteoarthritis is often overlooked, even when it co-occurs with other major health conditions like heart disease, diabetes, and mental health issues. Misconceptions about osteoarthritis being an inevitable part of aging and the lack of effective treatments can lead to therapeutic nihilism among patients and practitioners. Furthermore, patients are often misinformed about treatment options, which can range from neglecting essential interventions like exercise and education to relying on costly, unproven medications for advanced disease. I find it particularly concerning that rehabilitation counseling, which combines physical and psychological support, could be a valuable approach to addressing osteoarthritis and its multifaceted consequences.",
    "Outreach Chicago is a organization that helps homeless people and those who don't get the support they need from other groups. Their main goal is to provide people with the necessities they need to get back on their feet and live successfully in society.\n\nLet's use some logical thinking to figure out if Outreach Chicago really does help people. Our hypothesis is that they do provide help. And it looks like they do - they serve meals, give out hygiene kits, coats, blankets, socks, and undergarments to those in need. Their website even has exact numbers to back it up, showing they've been doing this since 2011.\n\nOutreach Chicago says that in the areas they work in, 34% of adults and 51% of kids live in poverty. But if we compare this to other sources, like Welfare Info, we see that the poverty rates in those areas are actually a bit lower - around 25.8% on average. So maybe Outreach Chicago is using older data or focusing on the poorest area, Harvey.\n\nWe could do some research to see if the services Outreach Chicago provides are really meeting the needs of their customers. We could ask customers about their experience and what they think of the goods they receive. This could help Outreach Chicago figure out what they're doing well and what they could improve.\n\nWe could also do a survey to see if most customers are happy with the services they receive. If more than 50% of customers are satisfied, that would be a good sign that Outreach Chicago is doing something right. This research could help the organization see how well they're doing and make changes to better serve their customers.",
    "The rapid growth of cities has become a pressing issue of our time, posing both environmental and social challenges. Cities have limited capacity to provide decent employment opportunities for all residents, and their ecological footprint is increasing. Unchecked urbanization leads to pollution, poverty, and other problems. However, governments can take steps to mitigate these issues. \n\nOne major concern is congestion and traffic jams, which contribute to severe air pollution. The primary culprit is road transport, which releases massive amounts of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen into the air. Another significant issue is poverty, particularly among disadvantaged groups in rural areas who migrate to cities in search of better job opportunities. Unfortunately, they often lack the necessary education and skills, leading to exploitation and poor working conditions.\n\nOvercrowding also results in waste management issues, as the sheer volume of garbage from residents becomes difficult to dispose of. In some European countries, this problem is addressed through separate garbage collection and recycling programs.\n\nTo address traffic and air pollution, it is essential to promote the use of public transport and invest in infrastructure development, such as building more roads and improving public transportation systems. While poverty remains a significant challenge, it is worth noting that global poverty rates have declined significantly over time, and continued efforts are likely to lead to further progress in the fight against poverty.",
