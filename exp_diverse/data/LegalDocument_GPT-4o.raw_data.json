Felony offenses that involve explosives qualify as “violent crimes” for purposes of enhancing the sentences of career offenders. See 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) (defining a “violent felony” as: “any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year ... that ... involves use of explosives”). Courts have found possession of a'bomb to be a crime of violence based on the lack of a nonviolent purpose for a bomb and the fact that, by its very nature, there is a substantial risk that the bomb would be used against the person or property of another.

    "In a property tax sale, the Court has confirmed that under section 6323(b)(6), a county’s tax lien takes precedence over a federal lien. Consequently, when Taylor acquired the property, it remained subject to the county’s lien. This precedent, established in Taylor v. Mill, 310 S.C. 526, 528, 426 S.E.2d 311, 312 (1992), clarifies that section 6323 is designed to determine lien priority rather than eliminate liens. Enforcing this provision ensures that tax sales remain effective, as potential buyers are prompted to investigate any existing federal tax liens on properties. Appellants contested that the master did not give due consideration to section 6323, arguing it should take precedence over the more general section 7425, in line with the legal principle illustrated in Capco of Summerville, Inc. v.

SCS Credit Corp., 541 U.S. 465, 484-85, 124 S.Ct. 1951, 158 L.Ed.2d 787 (2004), the Supreme Court adopted a formula approach for adjustments of the prime national interest rate based on the risk of nonpayment.\n\nSection 1325(a) of the Bankruptcy Code should be emphasized for its specific application to these circumstances.\n\nRelevant case law includes In re Billings, 838 F.2d 405 (10th Cir. 1988), and In re Horn, 338 B.R. 110, 113.",
    "In the record of any possible medical treatment that Monroe County or the individual defendants might have provided to save the life of the Decedent, Phillips argues in her brief that proving chemotherapy would have saved the Decedent’s life is unnecessary. Initially, she points to the fright and anxiety experienced by both her and the Decedent due to the delay in chemotherapy. However, Phillips confuses the issue of causation in this context. In a survival action, it would be appropriate to seek damages for the Decedent’s physical suffering and mental anxiety resulting from the alleged lack of medical care. In a wrongful death context, though, damages are not available until the plaintiff overcomes the causation requirement, as established in Wilks v. Am. Tobacco Co., 680 So.2d 839, 842 (Miss.1996) (<HOLDING>). Secondly, Phillips suggests that she only needs to",
    "The second Olano requirement is met: the mistake—both not having a jury decide on a key part of the crime and not including that part in the indictment—was clearly obvious. Did this clear mistake affect Thomas's major rights? A mistake affects a defendant's major rights if it caused harm and changed the outcome of the trial. Though showing harm is needed to prove an error isn't harmless, the key difference with plain error is that the defendant, not the Government, must prove it.",
    "As a dedicated special education teacher embarking on her chosen career path, the ongoing harm she faces is evident. The Plaintiff's request for injunctive relief—specifically, that the Individual Defendants alter her grades and allow her to continue her studies at Hunger College—is forward-looking. It necessitates state officials to take future action to prevent both present and future harm. The fact that this injunction also addresses a past harm does not make it retroactive. As precedent establishes, the need for prospective relief often arises from a past injury, and addressing this does not undermine the rule allowing forward-looking injunctions. See Flint, 488 F.3d at 825; Russell v. Dunston, 896 F.2d 664, 668 (2d Cir.1990) (citing Milliken v. Bradley, 433 U.S. 267, 97).",

According to Boykin, to modify custody, there are two requirements: 1) a substantial and material change in circumstances, and 2) the change must promote the child's welfare. The party seeking the modification must meet the \"extraordinary burden of proving both elements\" (843 So.2d at 320). The trial court must apply this rigorous test (Hastings, 875 So.2d at 779). The court in this case did not apply this test. Our review of",

According to Section 1677e(b) of Title 19, when Commerce determines \"that an interested party failed to cooperate... [the agency] may use an\" adverse inference.

Plaintiffs contend that by choosing not to opt-out, the class member essentially agrees that the class certification is appropriate. Courts have supported this view; for instance, they have determined that failing to opt-out generally prevents objections about the adequacy of class representation. Examples include Shore v. Parklane Hosiery Co., Inc., where the court noted that the opt-out right safeguards class members against claims of inadequate representation, and Torrisi v. Tucson Elec. Power Co., which reinforced this principle.",
    "Regarding the debtor, this distinction seems irrelevant based on the wording of sec. 409.402(7), Stats. In some situations, a security interest that was once properly perfected can later become unperfected due to creditor inaction. See, for example, sec. 409.103(1)(d)1, (2)(b), (3)(e), Stats, which involves grace periods of four months for perfection preservation in collateral moved out of jurisdiction, and sec. 409.403(2), which discusses the lapse of financing statements after five years unless they are continued. Interestingly, the Ansley court determined that filing under \"Ansley Farms\" instead of the debtor’s actual name, Emory Ansley, was misleading enough to render the security interest unperfected. See id., 467 F.Supp. at 55. Similar conclusions were reached in other cases: In Re Wishart, 10 U.C.C. Rep. Serv. 1296 (Bankr.W.D. Mich. 1972) and In Re Brawn, 7 U.C.C. Rep. Serv. 565 (D.C.).",

Bustamonte, 412 U.S. 218 (1973), the Supreme Court emphasized this approach. In this particular case, the district court's understanding of the unique facts and circumstances shifted from its first order to its second order. Initially, the court did not find any constitutional issues with Loos’s and Escobar’s consents. However, upon reviewing the evidence with the perspective that there had been an unlawful seizure, the court then determined that their consents were constitutionally inadequate. The district court correctly took into account the legal implications of the officer’s false statement about the drug dog alerting when deciding whether Loos and Escobar had voluntarily consented to the search of their luggage. The Supreme Court has noted that even when these nuances are considered, significant differences can still emerge in the legal assessment of consent.",

For instance, in Crews v. City of Mt. Vernon, the court determined that canceling a flexible work schedule was not a USERRA violation. Similarly, in Gross v.

The Defendants argued on appeal that the Plaintiff shouldn't have used the 2014 Report to back up her expert witness’s testimony, and we agree with the Defendants on this. It’s a well-known rule that \"experts can’t use other experts' opinions who aren’t testifying to support their own opinions,\" because this means one expert is just relaying another's opinion without that other expert being cross-examined.

    "While the Appellate Division and the New York Court of Appeals specifically opted not to address whether evidence was rightfully excluded under C.P.L. § 250.10(2), the County Court remains the only court to have thoroughly examined the merits of the claim. In retrospect, the trial judge's interpretation of C.P.L. § 250.10(2) as encompassing lay evidence, including a defendant’s own testimony in support of an Extreme Emotional Disturbance (EED) defense, has proven sound. Recently, the New York Court of Appeals affirmed this by resolving a previously unanswered question left open in Smith’s case: whether a defendant must provide notice under C.P.L. § 250.10 when intending to rely exclusively on lay testimony to establish an EED defense. This was clarified in People v. Diaz, 904 N.Y.S.2d 343, 930 N.E.2d at 266, where the court definitively answered in the affirmative. The implication of preclusion as a sanction affects both...",

Rule 7013, while addressing counterclaims and cross-claims, does not cover their severance and merely applies Fed.R.Civ.P. 13 to bankruptcy proceedings, with a note that a party being sued by a debtor-in-possession or trustee isn't required to counterclaim prepetition claims.

Mirage Resorts, 140 F.3d 478, 484-85 (3d Cir. 1998)), it is alleged that Turchi was to sign the forbearance agreement in his capacity as a guarantor, which is not a trivial detail. This lawsuit does not seek to enforce the guarantee. Rather, it is the Debtor, as the primary borrower, who has initiated the suit against the lender, the primary obligee. The Court's interpretation of the complaint does not suggest that Turchi, in his role as guarantor, suffered a personal and definitive injury due to the Bank's alleged actions.

For example, in Herbes, 180 Ill.App.3d at 698-99, 129 Ill.Dec. 480, 536 N.E.2d 164, the court found that the plaintiff's counsel, who was suing a township over its open-space acquisition program, couldn't represent the plaintiff. This was because the same lawyer had previously had an attorney-client relationship with the township when it considered hiring him for representation in that same program, showing the township’s intention to hire him and thus share details about the program freely. Similarly, in Hughes, 565 F.Supp. at 670, the court reached a related conclusion, as did the court in Int’l. Paper Co. v. Lloyd Manufacturing Co.",

First, any detention related to that investigation was brief. The total encounter between Rodriguez and law enforcement, from the moment he was pulled over until the currency was discovered, lasted about forty minutes. Given these circumstances, even if Rodriguez’s detention spanned this entire period, it might not indicate a Terry Stop of unreasonable scope. See United States v.

They decided Ohio could, based on the harm caused to children used in its production and the harm children suffer when child pornography is used to seduce or coerce them into sexual activity.

However, the report failed to name any specific contractors or identify particular locations where fraudulent activity may have occurred. Given the broad scope of the ESPCs and the GAO report’s lack of detailed information, the report did not provide sufficient data to enable the government to launch an investigation against Honeywell.

Indeed, some individuals may have a bias towards preferring biological parents over other types of couples, but this bias finds no support in federal or state law. There's no evidence that the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) changes any laws related to childbearing, procreation, or family structure.

    "Regarding the subject of the gates at Lemmon Avenue Terminal, the plaintiffs are entitled to a partial summary judgment.

This right includes the ability to exclude others, including the city of Dallas, from entering and destroying these gates. The plaintiffs assert that the legislative action that deprives them of their right to exclude others, by itself, constitutes a government taking of property. \n\nThis issue of physical taking depends on the court’s interpretation of the legal requirements set forth by the WARA and can be decided through a motion for summary judgment. This approach is supported by precedents such as Billings v. United States, where statutory construction is considered a legal question suitable for summary judgment (322 F.3d 1328, 1332 (Fed.Cir.2003)), and Santa Fe Pacific Railroad Co., which supports similar legal determinations (294 F.3d at 1340).

    "Both the husband and wife acknowledged that there was no goodwill to be considered and believed the business was not worthy of being evaluated as an ongoing enterprise. Nevertheless, at the conclusion of the trial, the court attributed $10,000 of goodwill to the trucking company. The trial court issued its opinion letter in March 2000, assigning a goodwill value to the business, and released its judgment in August 2000. During that period, the husband did not object to the trial court's assignment of goodwill. This lack of objection leads the wife to assert that the husband did not preserve his argument. We agree with the wife that the husband did not properly preserve his objection to the trial court’s decision on goodwill. See McDougal v.

The civil rights claims seemingly rest on allegations of false arrest and malicious prosecution; hence, the court considers these claims as assertions of a violation of Gatter's Fourth Amendment rights.

In the Watson case, the Court determined that the local Presbyterian congregation was part of a hierarchical church structure and thus deferred to the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America. In subsequent rulings, the United States Supreme Court further delineated the boundaries of judicial intervention in disputes within religious congregations. For example, in Bouldin v.

However, this argument seems to show a misunderstanding of the law—essentially, \"I thought the law was different.\" Such arguments are easily dismissed, as seen in United States v.

    "In the landmark case of Dawco Construction, Inc. v. United States, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit clarified that the Contract Disputes Act (CDA) designates the individual responsible for making the final decision on a dispute. Specifically, the court highlighted that once a claim is initiated, it must be submitted to the contracting officer, who then holds the authority to render the final decision. This principle was outlined in Dawco Construction, Inc. v. United States, 930 F.2d 872, 880 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (emphasis added), although it was later revised in part by Reflectone, Inc., 60 F.3d at 1579.\n\nWith this framework in mind, the court examined whether Kemron had properly submitted a \"claim\" to the contracting officer, thereby fulfilling the necessary jurisdictional requirements to pursue a CDA claim for nonmonetary relief.

Not taking this lightly, AIGA files an objection per Pa.R.A.P. 3781(c), arguing that the entire claim, including post-judgment interest, should be accepted and assigned priority level (b).\n\nTo resolve this clash, the Court appoints a referee. Drawing on a pivotal ruling from the case of CSAC Excess Insurance Authority v.

    "For judges, managing trials and overseeing lawyers can pose significant challenges, sometimes necessitating firm measures that may appear severe or even oppressive. Implementing a stringent standard that reserves sanctions solely for instances of overtly abusive conduct can help to ensure that councils do not unfairly penalize appropriate actions due to inexperience. Moreover, beyond the issue of inexperience, it is essential to recognize that judges themselves are capable of unfair—sometimes even vengeful—behavior towards their peers. By adhering to a rigorous standard, we can mitigate, though not entirely prevent, the misuse of judicial discipline as a tool for targeting unpopular judges who are nonetheless acting appropriately. Additionally, like the threat of civil liability for judicial actions, judicial discipline can deter judges from exercising their discretion properly.

According to Section 405 of the Communications Act, the Commission has to get a chance to address an issue before it can go to court. In this scenario, Bartholdi only mentioned its privilege claims, if ever, to the WTB. They didn’t say anything about attorney-client or work-product privilege in their review application to the Commission. Simply bringing up an issue to a Bureau of the FCC isn’t enough for it to be considered for judicial review. It’s the Commission itself that needs to have the chance to address the issue first.

Furthermore, we must consider whether the admission of this collateral-crime evidence constitutes reversible error. This Court has consistently held that the erroneous admission of irrelevant collateral crimes evidence is presumed to be harmful error due to the significant risk that a jury will view the defendant's bad character or propensity for crime as proof of guilt for the charged offense. This position is supported by precedent in Castro v. State, 547 So.2d 111, 115 (Fla.1989), quoting Straight v. State, 397 So.2d 903, 908 (Fla.1981), and similarly upheld in Czubak v.

    "We strongly challenge Sachs's argument that selling only UPCM's stock, rather than its real property assets, automatically excludes the transaction from UREBA's jurisdiction. While stocks or shares in a corporation are usually considered personal property, there are instances where their transfer is entirely secondary to the real property assets involved. Consider J.I. Kislak v. Carol Mgmt. Corp., 7 A.D.2d 428, 184 N.Y.S.2d 815, 318 (N.Y.App.Div.1959), which states, \"A sale of all of the stock of a corporation has been held to be a sale of its assets.\" Many jurisdictions examine such transactions based on their substance over their form. For example, see Cooney v. Ritter, 939 F.2d 81, 86-89 (3d Cir.1991) (<HOLDING>); Shochet See., Inc. v. First Union Corp., 663.",
    "In 1068 (1952), addressing free speech and equal protection, and Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U.S. 1 (1948), focusing on equal protection, the government asserts that the regulations allowing cable operators to restrict access to indecent material don't require First or Fifth Amendment analysis because the restriction would be imposed by a private cable operator, not the government (Respondents’ Brief at 16). Nonetheless, even if a private party makes the final decision to restrict speech or acts discriminatorily, the state can be held accountable if it played a significant role in encouraging the infringement. For example, in Franz v. United States, 707 F.2d 582, 592 n. 38 (D.C.Cir.1983), it was held that such governmental encouragement could make the state liable. We conclude that Section 10 significantly encourages such actions.",
    "Regarding the assessment of injuries and the associated degree of disability related to preexisting conditions versus those resulting from falls, the Commission was not obliged to accept the evidence provided and could selectively disregard any part it found lacking credibility. This principle is supported by Hutchinson v. Tri-State Motor Transit Co., 721 S.W.2d 158, 162 (Mo.App. S.D.1986). The Commission has the authority to resolve the fact-based questions surrounding the degree of disability stemming from an injury and any preexisting conditions, as noted in Carter v. Frito-Lay, 913 S.W.2d 341, 343 (Mo.App. E.D.1995). Furthermore, the task of choosing between two conflicting medical opinions is the Commission's responsibility, as highlighted in Johnson v. Denton Constr. Co., 911 S.W.2d 286, 288 (Mo.banc 1995); see also Duncan v. Springfield R-12 Sch. Dist., 897 S.W.2d 108, 113 (Mo.App. S.D.1995).

    "On December 7, 2007, the defendant appeared in court, and the court dismissed the cases due to the State's failure to prosecute, as no charging documents had been filed in either case. The court subsequently issued orders dismissing the cases with prejudice, citing the State’s failure to file the charging documents or to undertake any action to prosecute. [¶ 4] Generally, the district court holds jurisdiction to hear criminal cases under N.D. Const. art. VI, § 8, and N.D.C.C. § 27-05-06(1). However, in this instance, the issue is whether the court possesses the authority to dismiss a criminal action under N.D.R.Crim.P. 48(b) in the absence of a filed charging document. This Court maintains jurisdiction pursuant to N.D. Const. art. VI, §§ 2 and 6, and N.D.C.C. § 29-28-07(1). Refer to City of Jamestown v. Snellman, 1998 ND 200, ¶ 5, 586 N.W.2d 494 (<HOLDING>); State v. Howe, 247 N.W.2d 647, 652 (N.D.1976).",

    "The Government asserts that areas constituting a residence are subject to a legitimate expectation of privacy.

In addition to these arguments, the Government primarily contends that the Defendant lacks a legitimate expectation of privacy in the common areas of the apartment building. (Id. at 7.) Given its foundational importance, this latter argument serves as the focal point for the Court’s inquiry under the Fourth Amendment. It has been established that there is no reasonable expectation of privacy in the common areas of a multi-unit apartment building. See United States v.

    "Bronster, 82 Hawai’i at 40, 919 P.2d at 302, elaborates on the concept that damage to a product simply signifies it has not met the customer's expectations, indicating that the customer has received a product of insufficient value. According to this ruling, under the economic loss rule, a manufacturer engaged in a commercial relationship bears no duty, whether under negligence or strict products liability theories, to prevent a product from harming itself. This principle was further supported in Leis Family Ltd. Partnership v. Silversword Engineering, 126 Hawai’i 532, 538-39, 273 P.3d 1218, 1224-25 (Haw.Ct.App.2012), which cited the same precedent from Bronster, 82 Hawai’i at 39, 919 P.2d at 301. The economic loss rule similarly extends to claims based on negligent design and/or manufacturing, as noted in Bronster, 82 Hawai’i at 40, 919 P.2d at 302, and to claims of negligent misrepresentation, as held in City Express, 87 Hawai’i at 470, 959 P.2d at 840.

    "In the cited case, found at 392 U.S., page 436, [88 S.Ct., page 2201], the Court referenced one of the \"rights enumerated\" in Section 1, which is articulated as \"the same right to make and enforce contracts as is enjoyed by white citizens.\" This is supported by the 14 Statute at Large, page 27. Consequently, the Court concluded that just as in the Jones case, where an African American's Section 1 right to purchase property on the same terms as white individuals was infringed upon when a private seller refused to sell to him solely on the basis of his race, similarly, an African American's Section 1 right to \"make and enforce contracts\" is breached if a private offeror denies him, solely because of his race, the same opportunity to enter into contracts that is afforded to white individuals. This is further corroborated by the case found at 427 U.S., pages 170-171, 96 S.Ct., page 2594. Additionally, the precedents Johnson v. Railway Express Agency, Inc., 421 U.S. 454, 459-460, 95 S.Ct. 1716, 1720, 44 L.Ed.2d 295 (1975), and Tillman v. Wheaton-Haven Recreation Ass’n also support similar holdings.",

Applying this approach, Rodriguez’s conviction for first-degree burglary in California does not meet the criteria for generic burglary because the California Penal Code Sections 459 and 460 do not require “unlawful or unprivileged entry” for a burglary conviction.

Pan Am's benevolence in accommodating laid-off employees to enable them to receive augmented benefits was entirely gratuitous and could not have imposed an obligation on Pan Am to extend this practice to all employees, nor could it have resulted in an alteration of the Plan’s terms.

    "In evaluating the sufficiency of an indictment, legal precedent highlights the necessity of ensuring that the allegations clearly convey the charges to a jury. As established in United States v.

United States, 342 U.S. 337, 343 n. 16, 72 S.Ct. 329, 96 L.Ed. 367 (1952)). For an indictment to be deemed sufficient, it must outline the elements of the charged offense and provide sufficient detail to inform the defendant of the charges faced, as emphasized in United States v. Sampson (371 U.S. 75, 76, 83 S.Ct. 173, 9 L.Ed.2d 136 (1962)) and United States v. Barker Steel Co., Inc. (985 F.2d 1123, 1125 (1st Cir.1993)). Furthermore, the indictment must enable the defendant to use an acquittal or conviction as a defense against any future prosecutions for the same offense. This standard was underscored in Hamling v. United States (418 U.S. 87, 117, 94 S.Ct. 2887, 41 L.Ed.2d 590 (1974)) and reaffirmed by the Teleguz court in upholding section 922(k).",
