    "I rented I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW from my video store because of all the controversy that surrounded it when it was first released in 1967. I also heard that at first it was seized by U.S. customs if it ever tried to enter this country, therefore being a fan of films considered \"controversial\" I really had to see this for myself.<br /><br />The plot is centered around a young Swedish drama student named Lena who wants to learn everything she can about life. In particular she wants to focus her attentions to making some sort of documentary on what the average Swede thought about certain political issues such as the Vietnam War and race issues in the United States. In between asking politicians and ordinary denizens of Stockholm about their opinions on politics, she has sex with her drama teacher, classmates, and married men.<br /><br />What kills me about I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is that 40 years ago, this was considered pornographic. Really, the sex and nudity scenes are few and far between, even then it's not shot like some cheaply made porno. While my countrymen mind find it shocking, in reality sex and nudity are a major staple in Swedish cinema. Even Ingmar Bergman, arguably their answer to good old boy John Ford, had sex scenes in his films.<br /><br />I do commend the filmmakers for the fact that any sex shown in the film is shown for artistic purposes rather than just to shock people and make money to be shown in pornographic theaters in America. I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is a good film for anyone wanting to study the meat and potatoes (no pun intended) of Swedish cinema. But really, this film doesn't have much of a plot.",
    "\"I Am Curious: Yellow\" is a risible and pretentious steaming pile. It doesn't matter what one's political views are because this film can hardly be taken seriously on any level. As for the claim that frontal male nudity is an automatic NC-17, that isn't true. I've seen R-rated films with male nudity. Granted, they only offer some fleeting views, but where are the R-rated films with gaping vulvas and flapping labia? Nowhere, because they don't exist. The same goes for those crappy cable shows: schlongs swinging in the breeze but not a clitoris in sight. And those pretentious indie movies like The Brown Bunny, in which we're treated to the site of Vincent Gallo's throbbing johnson, but not a trace of pink visible on Chloe Sevigny. Before crying (or implying) \"double-standard\" in matters of nudity, the mentally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women: there are no genitals on display when actresses appears nude, and the same cannot be said for a man. In fact, you generally won't see female genitals in an American film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica. This alleged double-standard is less a double standard than an admittedly depressing ability to come to terms culturally with the insides of women's bodies.",
    "If only to avoid making this type of film in the future. This film is interesting as an experiment but tells no cogent story.<br /><br />One might feel virtuous for sitting thru it because it touches on so many IMPORTANT issues but it does so without any discernable motive. The viewer comes away with no new perspectives (unless one comes up with one while one's mind wanders, as it will invariably do during this pointless film).<br /><br />One might better spend one's time staring out a window at a tree growing.<br /><br />",
    "This film was probably inspired by Godard's Masculin, féminin and I urge you to see that film instead.<br /><br />The film has two strong elements and those are, (1) the realistic acting (2) the impressive, undeservedly good, photo. Apart from that, what strikes me most is the endless stream of silliness. Lena Nyman has to be most annoying actress in the world. She acts so stupid and with all the nudity in this film,...it's unattractive. Comparing to Godard's film, intellectuality has been replaced with stupidity. Without going too far on this subject, I would say that follows from the difference in ideals between the French and the Swedish society.<br /><br />A movie of its time, and place. 2/10.",
    "Oh, brother...after hearing about this ridiculous film for umpteen years all I can think of is that old Peggy Lee song..<br /><br />\"Is that all there is??\" ...I was just an early teen when this smoked fish hit the U.S. I was too young to get in the theater (although I did manage to sneak into \"Goodbye Columbus\"). Then a screening at a local film museum beckoned - Finally I could see this film, except now I was as old as my parents were when they schlepped to see it!!<br /><br />The ONLY reason this film was not condemned to the anonymous sands of time was because of the obscenity case sparked by its U.S. release. MILLIONS of people flocked to this stinker, thinking they were going to see a sex film...Instead, they got lots of closeups of gnarly, repulsive Swedes, on-street interviews in bland shopping malls, asinie political pretension...and feeble who-cares simulated sex scenes with saggy, pale actors.<br /><br />Cultural icon, holy grail, historic artifact..whatever this thing was, shred it, burn it, then stuff the ashes in a lead box!<br /><br />Elite esthetes still scrape to find value in its boring pseudo revolutionary political spewings..But if it weren't for the censorship scandal, it would have been ignored, then forgotten.<br /><br />Instead, the \"I Am Blank, Blank\" rhythymed title was repeated endlessly for years as a titilation for porno films (I am Curious, Lavender - for gay films, I Am Curious, Black - for blaxploitation films, etc..) and every ten years or so the thing rises from the dead, to be viewed by a new generation of suckers who want to see that \"naughty sex film\" that \"revolutionized the film industry\"...<br /><br />Yeesh, avoid like the plague..Or if you MUST see it - rent the video and fast forward to the \"dirty\" parts, just to get it over with.<br /><br />",
    "I would put this at the top of my list of films in the category of unwatchable trash! There are films that are bad, but the worst kind are the ones that are unwatchable but you are suppose to like them because they are supposed to be good for you! The sex sequences, so shocking in its day, couldn't even arouse a rabbit. The so called controversial politics is strictly high school sophomore amateur night Marxism. The film is self-consciously arty in the worst sense of the term. The photography is in a harsh grainy black and white. Some scenes are out of focus or taken from the wrong angle. Even the sound is bad! And some people call this art?<br /><br />",
    "Whoever wrote the screenplay for this movie obviously never consulted any books about Lucille Ball, especially her autobiography. I've never seen so many mistakes in a biopic, ranging from her early years in Celoron and Jamestown to her later years with Desi. I could write a whole list of factual errors, but it would go on for pages. In all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film. The filmmakers tried hard, but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me.",
    "When I first saw a glimpse of this movie, I quickly noticed the actress who was playing the role of Lucille Ball. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucy is absolutely awful. Lucille Ball was an astounding comedian with incredible talent. To think about a legend like Lucille Ball being portrayed the way she was in the movie is horrendous. I cannot believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a much better Lucy, the producers decided to get Rachel York. She might be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of Lucille Ball is tough. It is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble Lucille Ball, but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent. If you noticed York's portrayal of Lucy in episodes of I Love Lucy like the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin, nothing is similar in any way-her expression, voice, or movement.<br /><br />To top it all off, Danny Pino playing Desi Arnaz is horrible. Pino does not qualify to play as Ricky. He's small and skinny, his accent is unreal, and once again, his acting is unbelievable. Although Fred and Ethel were not similar either, they were not as bad as the characters of Lucy and Ricky.<br /><br />Overall, extremely horrible casting and the story is badly told. If people want to understand the real life situation of Lucille Ball, I suggest watching A&E Biography of Lucy and Desi, read the book from Lucille Ball herself, or PBS' American Masters: Finding Lucy. If you want to see a docudrama, \"Before the Laughter\" would be a better choice. The casting of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in \"Before the Laughter\" is much better compared to this. At least, a similar aspect is shown rather than nothing.",
    "Who are these \"They\"- the actors? the filmmakers? Certainly couldn't be the audience- this is among the most air-puffed productions in existence. It's the kind of movie that looks like it was a lot of fun to shoot TOO much fun, nobody is getting any actual work done, and that almost always makes for a movie that's no fun to watch.<br /><br />Ritter dons glasses so as to hammer home his character's status as a sort of doppleganger of the bespectacled Bogdanovich; the scenes with the breezy Ms. Stratten are sweet, but have an embarrassing, look-guys-I'm-dating-the-prom-queen feel to them. Ben Gazzara sports his usual cat's-got-canary grin in a futile attempt to elevate the meager plot, which requires him to pursue Audrey Hepburn with all the interest of a narcoleptic at an insomnia clinic. In the meantime, the budding couple's respective children (nepotism alert: Bogdanovich's daughters) spew cute and pick up some fairly disturbing pointers on 'love' while observing their parents. (Ms. Hepburn, drawing on her dignity, manages to rise above the proceedings- but she has the monumental challenge of playing herself, ostensibly.) Everybody looks great, but so what? It's a movie and we can expect that much, if that's what you're looking for you'd be better off picking up a copy of Vogue.<br /><br />Oh- and it has to be mentioned that Colleen Camp thoroughly annoys, even apart from her singing, which, while competent, is wholly unconvincing... the country and western numbers are woefully mismatched with the standards on the soundtrack. Surely this is NOT what Gershwin (who wrote the song from which the movie's title is derived) had in mind; his stage musicals of the 20's may have been slight, but at least they were long on charm. \"They All Laughed\" tries to coast on its good intentions, but nobody- least of all Peter Bogdanovich - has the good sense to put on the brakes.<br /><br />Due in no small part to the tragic death of Dorothy Stratten, this movie has a special place in the heart of Mr. Bogdanovich- he even bought it back from its producers, then distributed it on his own and went bankrupt when it didn't prove popular. His rise and fall is among the more sympathetic and tragic of Hollywood stories, so there's no joy in criticizing the film... there _is_ real emotional investment in Ms. Stratten's scenes. But \"Laughed\" is a faint echo of \"The Last Picture Show\", \"Paper Moon\" or \"What's Up, Doc\"- following \"Daisy Miller\" and \"At Long Last Love\", it was a thundering confirmation of the phase from which P.B. has never emerged.<br /><br />All in all, though, the movie is harmless, only a waste of rental. I want to watch people having a good time, I'll go to the park on a sunny day. For filmic expressions of joy and love, I'll stick to Ernest Lubitsch and Jaques Demy...",
    "This is said to be a personal film for Peter Bogdonavitch. He based it on his life but changed things around to fit the characters, who are detectives. These detectives date beautiful models and have no problem getting them. Sounds more like a millionaire playboy filmmaker than a detective, doesn't it? This entire movie was written by Peter, and it shows how out of touch with real people he was. You're supposed to write what you know, and he did that, indeed. And leaves the audience bored and confused, and jealous, for that matter. This is a curio for people who want to see Dorothy Stratten, who was murdered right after filming. But Patti Hanson, who would, in real life, marry Keith Richards, was also a model, like Stratten, but is a lot better and has a more ample part. In fact, Stratten's part seemed forced; added. She doesn't have a lot to do with the story, which is pretty convoluted to begin with. All in all, every character in this film is somebody that very few people can relate with, unless you're millionaire from Manhattan with beautiful supermodels at your beckon call. For the rest of us, it's an irritating snore fest. That's what happens when you're out of touch. You entertain your few friends with inside jokes, and bore all the rest.",
    "It was great to see some of my favorite stars of 30 years ago including John Ritter, Ben Gazarra and Audrey Hepburn. They looked quite wonderful. But that was it. They were not given any characters or good lines to work with. I neither understood or cared what the characters were doing.<br /><br />Some of the smaller female roles were fine, Patty Henson and Colleen Camp were quite competent and confident in their small sidekick parts. They showed some talent and it is sad they didn't go on to star in more and better films. Sadly, I didn't think Dorothy Stratten got a chance to act in this her only important film role.<br /><br />The film appears to have some fans, and I was very open-minded when I started watching it. I am a big Peter Bogdanovich fan and I enjoyed his last movie, \"Cat's Meow\" and all his early ones from \"Targets\" to \"Nickleodeon\". So, it really surprised me that I was barely able to keep awake watching this one.<br /><br />It is ironic that this movie is about a detective agency where the detectives and clients get romantically involved with each other. Five years later, Bogdanovich's ex-girlfriend, Cybil Shepherd had a hit television series called \"Moonlighting\" stealing the story idea from Bogdanovich. Of course, there was a great difference in that the series relied on tons of witty dialogue, while this tries to make do with slapstick and a few screwball lines.<br /><br />Bottom line: It ain't no \"Paper Moon\" and only a very pale version of \"What's Up, Doc\".",
    "I can't believe that those praising this movie herein aren't thinking of some other film. I was prepared for the possibility that this would be awful, but the script (or lack thereof) makes for a film that's also pointless. On the plus side, the general level of craft on the part of the actors and technical crew is quite competent, but when you've got a sow's ear to work with you can't make a silk purse. Ben G fans should stick with just about any other movie he's been in. Dorothy S fans should stick to Galaxina. Peter B fans should stick to Last Picture Show and Target. Fans of cheap laughs at the expense of those who seem to be asking for it should stick to Peter B's amazingly awful book, Killing of the Unicorn.",
    "Never cast models and Playboy bunnies in your films! Bob Fosse's \"Star 80\" about Dorothy Stratten, of whom Bogdanovich was obsessed enough to have married her SISTER after her murder at the hands of her low-life husband, is a zillion times more interesting than Dorothy herself on the silver screen. Patty Hansen is no actress either..I expected to see some sort of lost masterpiece a la Orson Welles but instead got Audrey Hepburn cavorting in jeans and a god-awful \"poodlesque\" hair-do....Very disappointing....\"Paper Moon\" and \"The Last Picture Show\" I could watch again and again. This clunker I could barely sit through once. This movie was reputedly not released because of the brouhaha surrounding Ms. Stratten's tawdry death; I think the real reason was because it was so bad!",
    "Its not the cast. A finer group of actors, you could not find. Its not the setting. The director is in love with New York City, and by the end of the film, so are we all! Woody Allen could not improve upon what Bogdonovich has done here. If you are going to fall in love, or find love, Manhattan is the place to go. No, the problem with the movie is the script. There is none. The actors fall in love at first sight, words are unnecessary. In the director's own experience in Hollywood that is what happens when they go to work on the set. It is reality to him, and his peers, but it is a fantasy to most of us in the real world. So, in the end, the movie is hollow, and shallow, and message-less.",
    "Today I found \"They All Laughed\" on VHS on sale in a rental. It was a really old and very used VHS, I had no information about this movie, but I liked the references listed on its cover: the names of Peter Bogdanovich, Audrey Hepburn, John Ritter and specially Dorothy Stratten attracted me, the price was very low and I decided to risk and buy it. I searched IMDb, and the User Rating of 6.0 was an excellent reference. I looked in \"Mick Martin & Marsha Porter Video & DVD Guide 2003\" and  wow  four stars! So, I decided that I could not waste more time and immediately see it. Indeed, I have just finished watching \"They All Laughed\" and I found it a very boring overrated movie. The characters are badly developed, and I spent lots of minutes to understand their roles in the story. The plot is supposed to be funny (private eyes who fall in love for the women they are chasing), but I have not laughed along the whole story. The coincidences, in a huge city like New York, are ridiculous. Ben Gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man, with the women falling for him as if her were a Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas or George Clooney, is quite ridiculous. In the end, the greater attractions certainly are the presence of the Playboy centerfold and playmate of the year Dorothy Stratten, murdered by her husband pretty after the release of this movie, and whose life was showed in \"Star 80\" and \"Death of a Centerfold: The Dorothy Stratten Story\"; the amazing beauty of the sexy Patti Hansen, the future Mrs. Keith Richards; the always wonderful, even being fifty-two years old, Audrey Hepburn; and the song \"Amigo\", from Roberto Carlos. Although I do not like him, Roberto Carlos has been the most popular Brazilian singer since the end of the 60's and is called by his fans as \"The King\". I will keep this movie in my collection only because of these attractions (manly Dorothy Stratten). My vote is four.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): \"Muito Riso e Muita Alegria\" (\"Many Laughs and Lots of Happiness\")",
    "This film is just plain horrible. John Ritter doing pratt falls, 75% of the actors delivering their lines as if they were reading them from cue cards, poor editing, horrible sound mixing (dialogue is tough to pick up in places over the background noise), and a plot that really goes nowhere. I didn't think I'd ever say this, but Dorothy Stratten is not the worst actress in this film. There are at least 3 others that suck more. Patti Hansen delivers her lines with the passion of Ben Stein. I started to wonder if she wasn't dead inside. Even Bogdanovich's kids are awful (the oldest one is definitely reading her lines from a cue card). This movie is seriously horrible. There's a reason Bogdanovich couldn't get another project until 4 years later. Please don't watch it. If you see it in your television listings, cancel your cable. If a friend suggests it to you, reconsider your friendship. If your spouse wants to watch it, you're better off finding another soulmate. I'd rather gouge my eyes out with lawn darts than sit through this piece of garbage again. If I could sum this film up in one word, that word would be: Suckotrocity",
    "My interest in Dorothy Stratten caused me to purchase this video. Although it had great actors/actresses, there were just too many subplots going on to retain interest. Plus it just wasn't that interesting. Dialogue was stiff and confusing and the story just flipped around too much to be believable. I was pretty disappointed in what I believe was one of Audrey Hepburn's last movies. I'll always love John Ritter best in slapstick. He was just too pathetic here.",
    "I think I will make a movie next weekend. Oh wait, I'm working..oh I'm sure I can fit it in. It looks like whoever made this film fit it in. I hope the makers of this crap have day jobs because this film sucked!!! It looks like someones home movie and I don't think more than $100 was spent making it!!! Total crap!!! Who let's this stuff be released?!?!?!",
    "Pros: Nothing<br /><br />Cons: Everything<br /><br />Plot summary: A female reporter runs into a hitchhiker that tells her stories about the deaths of people that were killed by zombies.<br /><br />Review: Never in my life have I come across a movie as bad The Zombie Chronicles. Filmed on a budget of what looks to be about 20 bucks, TZC is a completely horrible horror movie that relies on lame, forgetable actors whom couldn't act to save their lives and gore that's more gross than frightening. How does a movie like this even get made? Simply put, avoid TZC like a sexually-transmitted disease.<br /><br />My last 2 cents: Humorously enough, this movie was made by a movie company called Brain Damage Films. They're brains must have really been damaged to come up with a craptacular movie like this.<br /><br />My rating: 1 out of 10(If it were up to me, this movie would get the rating of negative bajillion)",
    "If the crew behind \"Zombie Chronicles\" ever read this, here's some advice guys: <br /><br />1. In a \"Twist Ending\"-type movie, it's not a good idea to insert close-ups of EVERY DEATH IN THE MOVIE in the opening credits. That tends to spoil the twists, y'know...? <br /><br />2. I know you produced this on a shoestring and - to be fair - you worked miracles with your budget but please, hire people who can actually act. Or at least, walk, talk and gesture at the same time. Joe Haggerty, I'm looking at you...<br /><br />3. If you're going to set a part of your movie in the past, only do this if you have the props and costumes of the time.<br /><br />4. Twist endings are supposed to be a surprise. Sure, we don't want twists that make no sense, but signposting the \"reveal\" as soon as you introduce a character? That's not a great idea.<br /><br />Kudos to the guys for trying, but in all honesty, I'd rather they hadn't...<br /><br />Only for zombie completists.",
    "1st watched 8/3/2003 - 2 out of 10(Dir-Brad Sykes): Mindless 3-D movie about flesh-eating zombies in a 3 story within a movie chronicle. And yes, we get to see zombies eating human flesh parts in 3D!! Wow, not!! That has been done time and time again in 2D in a zombie movie but what usually makes a zombie movie better is the underlying story not the actual flesh-eating. That's what made the original zombie classics good. The flesh-eating was just thrown in as an extra. We're actually bored throughout most of this 3-part chronicle because of the lame(twilight-zone like) easily understood and slow-pacingly revealed finale's. The last story is actually the story the movie started with(having a reporter investigating a so-called ghost town) and of course we get to see flesh eating zombie's in that one as well. Well, I think I've said enough. Watch the classics, not this 3D bore-feast.",
    "There's tons of good-looking women in this flick. But alas, this movie is nudity-free. Grrrrrrrrrr Strike one.<br /><br />Ahem. One story in this film takes place in 1971. Then why the hell are the main characters driving a Kia Sportage? Hello? Continuity, anyone?<br /><br />As you might know, this movie was released in stereoscopic 3D. And it is the most hideous effect I have ever seen. I'm not sure if someone botched the job on this, but there WAS no 3D, just double-vision blurs. I didn't have the same problem with this company's other 3D movies, HUNTING SEASON and CAMP BLOOD. Sure, the 3D in those ones sucked too, but with them I could see a semblance of 3D effect.<br /><br />This thing is a big ball of nothing.<br /><br />And whoever that women was who played the daughter of the ear-eating dame, yum! I'd like to see more of her. In movies, as well. Looks like Janet Margolin at a young age. Purrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr<br /><br />",
    "En route to a small town that lays way off the beaten track (but which looks suspiciously close to a freeway), a female reporter runs into a strange hitch-hiker who agrees to help direct her to her destination. The strange man then recounts a pair of gruesome tales connected to the area: in the first story, an adulterous couple plot to kill the woman's husband, but eventually suffer a far worse fate themselves when they are attacked by a zombie; and in the second story, a group of campers have their vacation cut short when an undead outlaw takes umbrage at having his grave peed on.<br /><br />The Zombie Chronicles is an attempt by writer Garrett Clancy and director Brad Sykes at making a zombie themed anthologya nice idea, but with only two stories, it falls woefully short. And that's not the only way in which this low budget gore flick fails to deliver: the acting is lousy (with Joe Haggerty, as the tale-telling Ebenezer Jackson, giving one of the strangest performances I have ever seen); the locations are uninspired; the script is dreary; there's a sex scene with zero nudity; and the ending.... well, that beggars belief.<br /><br />To be fair, some of Sykes' creative camera-work is effective (although the gimmicky technique employed as characters run through the woods is a tad overused) and Joe Castro's cheapo gore is enthusiastic: an ear is bitten off, eyeballs are plucked out, a face is removed, brains are squished, and there is a messy decapitation. These positives just about make the film bearable, but be warned, The Zombie Chronicles ain't a stroll in the park, even for seasoned viewers of z-grade trash.<br /><br />I give The Zombie Chronicles 2/10, but generously raise my rating to 3 since I didn't get to view the film with the benefit of 3D (although I have a sneaking suspicion that an extra dimension wouldn't have made that much of a difference).",
    "Without wishing to be a killjoy, Brad Sykes is responsible for at least two of the most dull and clichéd films i've ever seen - this being one of them, and Camp Blood being another. <br /><br />The acting is terrible, the print is shoddy, and everything about this film screams \"seriously, you could do better yourself\". Maybe this is a challenge to everyone to saturate youtube with our own zombie related crap?<br /><br />I bought this for £1, but remember, you can't put a price on 71 minutes of your life. You'd do well to avoid this turkey, even at a bargain basement price.",
    "My girlfriend once brought around The Zombie Chronicles for us to watch as a joke. Little did we realize the joke was on her for paying £1 for it. While watching this film I started to come up with things I would rather be doing than watching The Zombie Chronicles. These included:<br /><br />1) Drinking bleach 2) Rubbing sand in my eyes 3) Writing a letter to Brad Sykes and Garrett Clancy 4) Re-enacting the American civil war 5) Tax returns 6) GCSE Maths 7) Sex with an old lady.<br /><br />Garrett Clancy, aka Sgt. Ben Draper wrote this? The guy couldn't even dig a hole properly. The best ting he did was kick a door down (the best part of the film). This was the worst film I have ever seen, and I've seen White Noise: The Light. Never has a film had so many mistakes in it. My girlfriend left it here, so now I live with the shame of owning this piece of crap.<br /><br />News just in: Owen Wilson watched this film and tried to kill himself. Fact.<br /><br />DO NOT WATCH",
    "Amateur, no budget films can be surprisingly good ... this however is not one of them.<br /><br />Ah, another Brad Sykes atrocity. The acting is hideous, except for Emmy Smith who shows some promise. The camera \"direction\" needs serious reworking. And no more \"hold the camera and run\" gimmicks either; it just doesn't work. The special effects are unimaginative, there's a problem when the effect can be identified in real time. If you're going to rip off an ear, please don't let us see the actor's real ear beneath the blood. The scenery is bland and boring (same as Mr. Sykes other ventures), and the music is a cross between cheap motel porn and really bad guitar driven metal (see the scenery comment).<br /><br />Did I mention the lack of any real plot, or character development? Apparently, the scriptwriter didn't.<br /><br />Whoever is funding this guy ... please stop. I've seen some of his other \"home movies\" (which I will not plug) and they are just as bad. Normally, a \"director\" will grow and learn from his previous efforts ... not this guy. It's one thing to be an amateur filmmaker, but anyone can be a hack.<br /><br />Definitely not even a popcorn film ... of course, chewing on popcorn kernels would be less painful than this effort.<br /><br />Award: The worst ever military push-ups in a film.",

    "Some films that you pick up for a pound turn out to be rather good - 23rd Century films released dozens of obscure Italian and American movie that were great, but although Hardgore released some Fulci films amongst others, the bulk of their output is crap like The Zombie Chronicles.<br /><br />The only positive thing I can say about this film is that it's nowhere near as annoying as the Stink of Flesh. Other than that, its a very clumsy anthology film with the technical competence of a Lego house built by a whelk.<br /><br />It's been noted elsewhere, but you really do have to worry about a film that inserts previews of the action into its credit sequence, so by the time it gets to the zombie attacks, you've seen it all already.<br /><br />Bad movie fans will have a ball watching the 18,000 continuity mistakes and the diabolical acting of the cast (especially the hitchhiker, who was so bad he did make me laugh a bit), and kudos to Hardgore for getting in to the spirit of things by releasing a print so bad it felt like I was watching some beat up home video of a camping trip.<br /><br />Awful, awful stuff. We've all made stuff like this when we've gotten a hold of a camera, but common sense prevails and these films languish in our cupboards somewhere. Avoid.",

    "I have not seen many low budget films i must admit, but this is the worst movie ever probably, the main character the old man talked like, he had a lobotomy and lost the power to speak more than one word every 5 seconds, a 5 year old could act better. The story had the most awful plot, and well the army guy had put what he thought was army like and then just went over the top, i only watched it to laugh at how bad it was, and hoped it was leading onto the real movie. I cant believe it was under the 2 night rental thing at blockbusters, instead of a please take this for free and get it out of our sight. I think there was one semi decent actor other than the woman, i think the only thing OK with the budget was the make up, but they show every important scene of the film in the beginning music bit. Awful simply awful.",
    "..Oh wait, I can! This movie is not for the typical film snob, unless you want to brush up on your typical cinematic definitions, like \"continuity editing\" and \"geographic match\". I couldn't tell where I was in this movie. One second they're in the present, next minute their supposedly in the 70's driving a modern SUV and wearing what looked like to me as 80's style clothing. I think. I couldn't pay long enough attention to it since the acting was just horrible. I think it only got attention because it has a 3d which I did not watch. If you're a b-movie buff, and by b-movie I mean BAD movie, then this film is for you. It's home-movie and all non-sense style will keep you laughing for as long as you can stay awake. If your tastes are more for Goddard and Antonioni, though, just skip this one.",
    "You have to admire Brad Sykes even if you don't particularly want to, a man who churns out budget horror after budget horror to less than enthusiastic receptions. But keeps on doing it all the same. Even the half-hearted praise than surrounds his Camp Blood films is given grudgingly and I'm as guilty of this as anyone. Brad normally manages to throw something interesting into the mix, a neat idea, a kooky character, whatever, but without the funds to take it further than base level, he relies on the audience to cut him some slack and appreciate it for what it is and what it could be. Joe Haggerty gives a spirited and very funny performance as Ebenezer Jackson and its a credit to Sykes that he can sense that this oddball turn is going to work within the framework of the film. Coming to a multiplex near you, in a parallel universe, somewhere.",
    "THE ZOMBIE CHRONICLES <br /><br />Aspect ratio: 1.33:1 (Nu-View 3-D)<br /><br />Sound format: Mono<br /><br />Whilst searching for a (literal) ghost town in the middle of nowhere, a young reporter (Emmy Smith) picks up a grizzled hitchhiker (Joseph Haggerty) who tells her two stories involving flesh-eating zombies reputed to haunt the area.<br /><br />An ABSOLUTE waste of time, hobbled from the outset by Haggerty's painfully amateurish performance in a key role. Worse still, the two stories which make up the bulk of the running time are utterly routine, made worse by indifferent performances and lackluster direction by Brad Sykes, previously responsible for the likes of CAMP BLOOD (1999). This isn't a 'fun' movie in the sense that Ed Wood's movies are 'fun' (he, at least, believed in what he was doing and was sincere in his efforts, despite a lack of talent); Sykes' home-made movies are, in fact, aggravating, boring and almost completely devoid of any redeeming virtue, and most viewers will feel justifiably angry and cheated by such unimaginative, badly-conceived junk. The 3-D format is utterly wasted here.",
    "A woman asks for advice on the road to reach a mysterious town, and hears two ghoulish stories from the local weirdo, both zombie related. But perhaps fate has something nasty in store for her too...<br /><br />The Zombie Chronicles is absolutely one of the worst films I have ever seen. In fact I must confess, so bad was it I fast forwarded through most of the garbage. And there was a lot of that, believe me. It runs for just 69 minutes, and there is still tons of filler. You get some skinhead doing a lot of push ups, plenty of dull kissy-kissy scenes between goofy teens (that rhymed, tee hee) and some fine examples of why some people should never become actors.<br /><br />As for the title characters, they barely even have a footnote in the film. Why, you get more undead action in the intro than you do the preceding feature! Though, considering how pathetic the eyes bursting out of sockets and the eating of brains sequences are (amongst other 'delights'), maybe that's a blessing in disguise.<br /><br />And to top it all off, it looks likes it's been filmed on someone's mobile phone for broadcast on Youtube. Jerky camera-work, scratches on the print, flickering lights... I had to rub my eyes when I realised it was made in 2001, and not 1971. Even the clothes and fashioned look about three decades out of date!<br /><br />If you think I'm not qualified to do a review of Chronicles having not seen the whole film, then go ahead. YOU try sitting through it, I betcha you won't even make it to the first appearance of the blue-smartie coloured freaks before making your excuses and leaving. It is truly laughable that anyone chose to release it, and honestly you'll get far more fun resting your drink on the disc than actually torturing your DVD player with this gigglesome excuse for horror. In fact, don't for surprised if it packs it's bags and leaves in the morning, leaving you doomed to watch VHS tapes for the rest of your life. You have been warned... 0/10<br /><br />P.S What kind of 18-rated horror has the woman keep a massive sports bra on during the obligatory sex scene?! See, the movie can't even get that part right...",
    "Really, I can't believe that I spent $5 on this movie. I am a huge zombie fanatic and thought the movie couldn't be that bad. It had zombies in it right? Was I wrong! To be honest the movie had it's moments...I thought it was cool when the guy got his head ripped off but that was about it. Overall I think that it would be more enjoyable to slide down a razorblade slide on my bare nutsack into a vat of vinegar then watch this movie again. The movie could have been better if we could see some boob but I had to watch the trailers for the other movies produced by this company to see that. Buyer beware...unless you are into masochism.",
    "I rented this movie about 3 years ago, and it still stands out in my mind as the worst movie ever made. I don't think I ever finished it. It is worse than a home video made by a high school student. I remember them doing a flashback to 1970 something and in the flashback there was a man with a polo shirt, oakley sunglasses and a newer SUV, like a Toyota Rav-4 or something (I don't remember). I don't understand how they could have possibly said that to be in the 70s. He might have had a cell phone too, I cant remember, It was just horrible. I returned it to the video store and asked them why they even carry the movie and if I could get the hour of my life back. To this day it is the worst movie I have ever seen, and I have seen some pretty bad ones.",
    ":Spoilers:<br /><br />I was very disappointed in Love's Abiding Joy. I had been waiting a really long time to see it and I finally got the chance when it re-aired Thursday night on Hallmark. I love the first three \"Love\" movies but this one was nothing like I thought it was going to be. The whole movie was sad and depressing, there were way to many goofs, and the editing was very poor - to many scenes out of context. I also think the death of baby Kathy happened way to soon and Clarks appearance in the movie just didn't seem to fit. It seemed like none of the actors really wanted to be there - they were all lacking emotion. There seemed to be no interaction between Missie and Willie at all.<br /><br />I think the script writers should have went more by the book. It seems like every movie that's been made so far just slips further and further away from Janette Oke's writings. I mean in the movie they never mentioned a thing about the mine and the two boys or Clark getting hurt because of it. And I think Missie and Willies reactions to Kathy's death could have been shown and heard rather than just heard.<br /><br />Out of the four movies that have been made so far I'd have to say that Love's Abiding Joy is my least favorite. I hope with the next four movies that more of the book is followed and if Clarks character is in them I hope he's got a bigger part and I hope his part isn't so bland. I also hope there is more of Scottie and Cookie and maybe even Marty but who knows what the script writers will have in store next.",
    "I've seen all four of the movies in this series. Each one strays further and further from the books. This is the worst one yet. My problem is that it does not follow the book it is titled after in any way! The directors and producers should have named it any thing other than \"Love's Abiding Joy.\" The only thing about this movie that remotely resembles the book are the names of some of the characters (Willie, Missie, Henry, Clark, Scottie and Cookie). The names/ages/genders of the children are wrong. The entire story line is no where in the book.<br /><br />I find it a great disservice to Janette Oke, her books and her fans to produce a movie under her title that is not correct in any way. The music is too loud. The actors are not convincing - they lack emotions.<br /><br />If you want a good family movie, this might do. It is clean. Don't watch it, though, if you are hoping for a condensed version of the book. I hope that this will be the last movie from this series, but I doubt it. If there are more movies made, I wish Michael Landon, Jr and others would stick closer to the original plot and story lines. The books are excellent and, if closely followed, would make excellent movies!",
    "I very much looked forward to this movie. Its a good family movie; however, if Michael Landon Jr.'s editing team did a better job of editing, the movie would be much better. Too many scenes out of context. I do hope there is another movie from the series, they're all very good. But, if another one is made, I beg them to take better care at editing. This story was all over the place and didn't seem to have a center. Which is unfortunate because the other movies of the series were great. I enjoy the story of Willie and Missy; they're both great role models. Plus, the romantic side of the viewers always enjoy a good love story.",
    "I have read all of the Love Come Softly books. Knowing full well that movies can not use all aspects of the book,but generally they at least have the main point of the book. I was highly disappointed in this movie. The only thing that they have in this movie that is in the book is that Missy's father comes to visit,(although in the book both parents come). That is all. The story line was so twisted and far fetch and yes, sad, from the book, that I just couldn't enjoy it. Even if I didn't read the book it was too sad. I do know that Pioneer life was rough,but the whole movie was a downer. The rating is for having the same family orientation of the film that makes them great.",
    "As a Southern Baptist, it pains me that I must give a below average rating to an overtly Christian movie. There certainly aren't so many that I want to discourage film-makers from a genre that's woefully under-exploited. Still, I must honestly say that \"Love's Abiding Joy\" is a typically low budget, low key, self-consciously Christian film. The plot is predictable, the acting mediocre (I'm being kind), and the editing atrocious. As a TV movie it might have been slightly above average, but as a feature film it leaves much to be desired. Keep trying guys. You've got to have a movie about about real Christians inside you somewhere. Might I suggest you turn to G. K. Chesterton or C. S. Lewis for some inspiration?",
    "As a kid I did think the weapon the murderer wielded was cool, however I was a kid and so I was a bit dumb. Even as a dumb kid though the movies plot was stupid and a bit boring when the killer was not using his light knife to kill people. What amazes me is that the movie has a really solid cast in it. What script did they read when agreeing to be in this movie as it is most assuredly boring and only a means to show off a light saber on a very small scale. The plot at times is incomprehensible and the end is totally chaotic. The whole film seems to rotate around aliens and the one weapon. The plot has two kids and some dude having an alien encounter, flash years later and there seems to be a return as it were in the mix. Dead animals and such to be explored and for some reason the one dude gets the weapon of the aliens and proceeds to use it to go on a very light killing spree. Seriously, you just have to wonder why this movie was made, if you are going to have a killer have some good death scenes, if you are going to have alien encounters show more than a weird light vortex thing, and if you are going to have light sabers then call yourself star wars.",
    "Jill Dunne (played by Mitzi Kapture), is an attractive, nice woman, over-whelmed by a smart-mouthed teenage daughter, Liv (Martha MacIsaac) and a petty, two-timing husband, Sean (Rick Roberts), both of which were tediously self-centered, and obnoxious.<br /><br />This was advertised as a troubled family stalked by a crazed killer during a relentless storm.<br /><br />The storm doesn't even happen until about the last 5 minutes of the film, and then it isn't anything to send anybody running to the storm cellar.<br /><br />The stalking, likewise doesn't get intense until almost the end of the film.<br /><br />Most of the film we spend listening to Jill and her insufferable daughter, Liv, argue until I just wanted to back slap the daughter into next week.<br /><br />Jill's problem with Liv is that she has taken up with Zack, a boy of questionable character, and they are constantly making out--in fact Jill comes home to find the two of them on Liv's bed.<br /><br />The rest of the time we spend listening to Jill's husband Sean either whine at Jill or criticize her.<br /><br />Sean was not at all appealing--since his face is so covered in freckles you could play connect the dots.<br /><br />The story begins with Jill being notified of an out-standing bill on their credit card for a hotel she has never been to, and that she thought Sean had never been to either.<br /><br />Jill goes to the hotel where she meets the owner & manager, Richard Grant (Nick Mancuso), a very nice, older, divorced man, who is sympathetic to her. In fact, when he spots her husband there again, he phones Jill and tips her off.<br /><br />Jill returns to the hotel, sees Sean with another woman. She is upset, leaves without Sean seeing her, and does absolutely nothing. In fact, she doesn't even say anything to Sean when he arrives home.

In fact, he seems a bit more aggressive than necessary, when Jill suddenly decides to cut out.<br /><br />Jill and Sean have a confrontation about his cheating. Sean whines about how Jill has been letting him down since her father died. Apparently his lack of any morals is all her fault. Eventually Jill confesses her own lack of morals and near adultery to Sean--and of course that's all her fault too, as far as Sean is concerned.<br /><br />The little family decides to go on a camping trip--which means more whining and grousing among them, especially from the spoiled daughter.<br /><br />I was so rooting for the stalker to get everybody, but Jill.<br /><br />3 stars",
    "This movie sucked. It really was a waste of my life. The acting was atrocious, the plot completely implausible. Long, long story short, these people get \"terrorized\" by this pathetic \"crazed killer\", but completely fail to fight back in any manner. And this is after they take a raft on a camping trip, with no gear, and show up at a campsite that is already assembled and completely stocked with food and clothes and the daughters headphones. Additionally, after their boat goes missing, they panic that they're stuck in the woods, but then the daughters boyfriend just shows up and they apparently never consider that they could just hike out of the woods like he did to get to them. Like I said, this movie sucks. A complete joke. Don't let your girlfriend talk you into watching it.",
    "Lifetime did it again. Can we say stupid? I couldn't wait for it to end. The plot was senseless. The acting was terrible! Especially by the teenagers. The story has been played a thousand times! Are we just desperate to give actors a job? The previews were attractive and I was really looking for a good thriller.Once in awhile lifetime comes up with a good movie, this isn't one of them. Unless one has nothing else to do I would avoid this one at all cost. This was a waste of two hours of my life. Can I get them back? I would have rather scraped my face against a brick wall for two hours then soaked it in peroxide. That would have been more entertaining.",
    "I have to say I am really surprised at the high ratings for this movie. I found it to be absolutely idiotic. The mother gets \"visions\" when she touches certain things or people? And one thing she touched twice made her vision continue... Just seemed so ridiculous. Deedee Pfieffer's performance was awful I thought. She was very irritating. The girl who played Lori did a good job and so did most of the supporting cast for what they had to work with.<br /><br />I usually love LMN and am very open minded when it comes to movies but this movie seemed to have a ridiculous plot and over the top acting and it just was not for me.",
    "The original book of this was set in the 1950s but that won't do for the TV series because most people watch for the 1930s style. Ironically the tube train near the end was a 1950s train painted to look like a 1930s train so the Underground can play at that game too. Hanging the storyline on a plot about the Jarrow March was feeble but the 50s version had students who were beginning to think about the world around them so I suppose making them think about the poverty of the marchers is much the same thing. All the stuff about Japp having to cater for himself was weak too but they had to put something in to fill the time. This would have made a decent half hour show or they could have filmed the book and made it a better long show. It is obvious this episode is a victim of style over content.",
    "The annoying mouse and lullaby really got to me and really had nothing to do with the story...It's something I would have done my 1st year in film school. Very sad. Additionally, the story just seemed to drag on for no apparent reason...there were too many things just thrown in there that had nothing to do with the story, which makes me feel that the creative team didn't really know what they were doing, or just that it should have been shorter...which would have been a blessing, not a crime. As I have just watched all of the episodes up to this point over the past week...I'd have to say that this was by far the worst, and I just wanted to warn others not to start with this one.",
    "I saw this film opening weekend in Australia, anticipating with an excellent cast of Ledger, Edgerton, Bloom, Watts and Rush that the definitive story of Ned Kelly would unfold before me. Unfortunately, despite an outstanding performance by Heath Ledger in the lead role, the plot was paper thin....which doesn't inspire me to read \"Our Sunshine\". There were some other plus points, the support acting from Edgerton in particular, assured direction from Jordan (confirming his talent on show in Buffalo Soldiers as well), and production design that gave a real feel of harshness to the Australian bush, much as the Irish immigrants of the early 19th century must have seen it. But I can't help feeling that another opportunity has been missed to tell the real story of an Australian folk hero (or was he?)....in what I suspect is a concession to Hollywood and selling the picture in the US. Oh well, at least Jordan and the producers didn't agree to lose the beards just to please Universal...<br /><br />Guess I will just have to content myself with Peter Carey's excellent \"Secret History of the Kelly Gang\". 4/10",
    "I saw this at the premiere in Melbourne<br /><br />It is shallow, two-dimensional, unaffecting and, hard to believe given the subject matter, boring. The actors are passable, but they didn't have much to work with given the very plodding and unimpressive script. For those who might have worried that Ned Kelly would be over-intellectualised, you can take comfort in the fact that this telling of the story is utterly without any literary depth at all, told entirely on the surface and full of central casting standards. However, it doesn't work as a popcorn film either. Its pacing is too off-kilter and its craft is too lacking to satisfy even on the level of a mundane actioner.<br /><br />I very much doubt Gregor Jordan could sit back and say to himself \"this is the best I could have done with the material\".<br /><br />Ned Kelly is a fascinating figure, and equally so is the national response to him. Possibly folk genius, possibly class warrior, possibly psychopath and probably all these things, he has dominated Australian true mythology for over 120 years. Once again, his story has failed miserably on the big screen.<br /><br />Such is life.",
    "Ned Kelly (Ledger), the infamous Australian outlaw and legend. Sort of like Robin Hood, with a mix of Billy the Kid, Australians love the legend of how he stood up against the English aristocratic oppression, and united the lower classes to change Australia forever. The fact that the lower classes of the time were around 70% immigrant criminals seems to be casually skimmed around by this film. Indeed, quite a few so called `facts' in this film are, on reflection, a tad dubious.<br /><br />I suppose the suspicions should have been aroused when, in the opening credits, it was claimed that this film is based upon the book, `Our Sunshine'. If ever a romanticized version of truth could be seen in a name for a book, there it was. This wasn't going to be a historical epic, but just an adaptation of one of many dubious legends of Ned Kelly, albeit a harsh and sporadically brutal version.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Ned Kelly is nothing more than an overblown Hallmark channel `real life historical drama' wannabe! The story plods along at an alarming rate (alarming because never has a film plodded so slowly!) The feeling of numbness after the two hours of pure drivel brought back memories of Costner's awful Wyatt Earp all those years ago. Simply put, nothing happens in the film, but it takes a long time getting to that nothing. This would possibly have been a tad more bearable if the performances were good (because the direction sure as heck wasn't). However, unless you are looking to play a game of spot the worst Oirish accent, then you're gonna be disappointed. Between that, the game of `Who has the stupidest beard?', `Spot the obvious backstabber!' (clue, they are all ginger for some reason), and `Nature in Australia.including lions', it is an experience similar to flicking through Hallmark, The History Channel, Discovery Channel, and Neighbours whilst suffering a huge hangover. Yup, nature pops up a lot, as to fill even more time (possibly an attempt to look arty), the film keeps showing pointless wildlife shots, and once all the native species are shown, here's a circus to allow for a camel and a lion (which is used during one fight to try to make us actually feel more sorry for the lion than the massacred people).<br /><br />This is a turgid, emotionless piece of historical fluff which should have gone straight to TV. There isn't even one good word I can say about this film. Even the usually fantastic Rush seems embarrassed to be here. When one of the characters comments that there is only 2 bullets left for him and his pal, I myself was wishing I had a gun to blow any memory of this film out of my head!",
    "They constructed this one as a kind of fantasy Man From Snowy River meets Butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid, and just for a romantic touch Ned and Joe get to play away with high class talent, the bored young wives of wealthy older men. OK, there are lots of myths about Ned Kelly, but there are also a lot of well documented facts, still leaving space for artistic creativity in producing a good historical dramaticisation. I mean, this is not the Robin Hood story, not the Arthurian legends, not Beowulf, not someone whose life is so shrouded in the mists of many many centuries past that any recreation of their life and times is 99% guesswork. It's only a couple of lifetimes ago. My own grandparents were already of school age when Ned was hanged. <br /><br />So it's silly me for fancifully imagining this movie was a serious attempt to tell the Kelly story. Having recently read Peter Carey's excellent novel \"The True History of the Kelly Gang\" I had eagerly anticipated that this would be in similar vein. But no, the fact is that Mick Jagger's much derided 1970 Kelly was probably far closer to reality, and a better movie overall, which isn't saying a whole lot for it.<br /><br />Glad it only cost me two bucks to hire the DVD! I'll give it 3/10, and that's only because some of the nice shots of the Australian bush make me feel generous.",
    "This has to be the worst piece of garbage I've seen in a while.<br /><br />Heath Ledger is a heartthrob? He looked deformed. I wish I'd known that he and Naomi Watts are an item in real life because I spent 2 of the longest hours of my life wondering what she saw in him. <br /><br />Orlando Bloom is a heartthrob? With the scraggly beard and deer-in-the-headlights look about him, I can't say I agree.<br /><br />Rachel Griffiths was her usual fabulous self, but Geoffrey Rush looked as if he couldn't wait to get off the set. <br /><br />I'm supposed to feel sorry for bankrobbers and murderers? This is a far cry from Butch Cassidy, which actually WAS an entertaining film. This was trite, cliche-ridden and boring. We only stayed because we were convinced it would get better. It didn't.<br /><br />The last 10-15 minutes or so were unintentionally hilarious. Heath and his gang are holed up in a frontier hotel, and women and children are dying because of their presence. That's not funny. But it was funny when they walked out of the hotel with the armor on, because all we could think of was the Black Knight from Monty Python and the Holy Grail. I kept waiting for them to say \"I'll bite yer leg off!\" We were howling with laughter, as were several other warped members of the audience. When we left, pretty much everyone was talking about what a waste of time this film was.<br /><br />I may not have paid cash to see this disaster (sneak preview), but it certainly wasn't free. It cost me 2 hours of my life that I will never get back.",
    "If the term itself were not geographically and semantically meaningless, one might well refer to \"Ned Kelly\" as an \"Australian Western.\" For the people Down Under, Ned Kelly was, apparently, a folk hero bandit akin to Robin Hood, Jesse James, Bonnie and Clyde, and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. The descendant of Irish immigrants, Kelly became a fugitive and an outlaw after he was falsely accused of shooting an Australian law officer, a crime for which his equally innocent mother was put into prison. To get back at the government for this mistreatment, Kelly, his brother Dan, and two other companions, became notorious bank robbers, winning over the hearts of many people in the countryside while striking a blow for justice in a land where Irish immigrants were often treated with disrespect and disdain by those who ran the country.<br /><br />Perhaps because we've encountered this \"gentleman bandit\" scenario so many times in the past, \"Ned Kelly\" feels awfully familiar and unoriginal as it pays homage to any number of the genre's stereotypes and clichés on its way to the inevitable showdown. Ned is the typical heart-of-gold lawbreaker who kills only when he is forced to and, even then, only with the deepest regret. He also has the pulse of the common folk, as when, in the middle of a bank robbery, he returns a valuable watch to one of the customers, after one of his gang has so inconsiderately pilfered it. What movie on this particular subject hasn't featured a scene like that? It's acts of selective generosity like this, of course, that earn him the love and respect of all the little people who come to secretly admire anyone who can get away with sticking it to the powers-that-be and the status quo. Geoffrey Rush plays the typical bedeviled law enforcer who feels a personal stake in bringing down this upstart troublemaker who keeps getting away with tweaking the establishment. There's even the inevitable episode in which one of the ladies being held up goes into the next room and has sex with one of the robbers, so turned on is she by the romantic derring-do of the criminal lifestyle. And the film is riddled with one hackneyed scene like this after another.<br /><br />Heath Ledger fails to distinguish himself in the title role, providing little in the way of substance to make his character either interesting or engaging. It doesn't help that he has been forced to provide a droning voice-over narration that underlines the sanctimoniousness and pretentiousness of both the character and the film.<br /><br />\"Ned Kelly\" might serve a function of sorts as a lesson in Australian history, but as an entertainment, it's just the same old story told with different accents.",
    "This movie was so unrelentingly bad, I could hardly believe I was watching it. The directing, editing, production, and script all seemed as though they had been done by junior high school students who don't know all that much about movies. There was no narrative flow that made any sort of sense. Big emotional moments and climaxes (like one early on between Heath Ledger and Naomi Watts) and character relationships (like one hinted at at the very beginning) come completely out of no where and are not set up like they would have been in a more elegantly and effectively made film. The characters are sadly underdeveloped, making it difficult for us to have any sort of connection with them. The acting, surprisingly, is not entirely bad, but the terrible writing cancels out the relatively convincing performances. The film plays like a particularly bad T.V. western/epic, and sadly diminishes the fascinating (true) story that it attempts to tell. I have read a lot of reviews that defend the film as being important to Australians because of the subject matter. That's all very well, but just because Ned Kelly is an important Australian historical icon DOESN'T MAKE THE MOVIE GOOD. No one is saying that the subject matter isn't good, just the quality of the movie itself. Pearl Harbor was about a very important historical event to Americans, but that doesn't mean I'm going to defend the movie and say it was good, because it was still bad. A failure all around, though Heath and Orlando are lovely to look at.",
    "This movie never made it to theaters in our area, so when it became available on DVD I was one of the first to rent it. For once, I should listened to the critics and passed on this one.<br /><br />Despite the excellent line up of actors the movie was very disappointing. I can see now why it went straight to video. <br /><br />I had thought that with Bloom, Ledger, and Rush it could have some value. All have done wonderful work in the past. <br /><br />The movie was slow moving and never pulled me in. I failed to develop much empathy for the characters and had to fight the urge to fast-forward just to get to the end. <br /><br />I do not recommend this film even if you are thinking of renting it for only for 'eye candy' purposes. It won't satisfy even that.",
    "I thought this was a very clunky, uninvolving version of a famous Australian story. Heath Ledger and Orlando Bloom were very good in their roles, and gave their characters some personality; but the whole thing felt forced and mechanical.<br /><br />The beginning could have been a lot more involving; perhaps starting with a shootout, and then flashing back for a recap of how they got there or that sort of thing. And I felt like every scene was routinely predictable and signposted, like a very bad tv soap.<br /><br />I was really looking forward to this movie, and hoping for something a lot better. The only thing I can say in its favour is that it beats the Mick Jagger version, but not by much.",
    "Ned aKelly is such an important story to Australians but this movie is awful. It's an Australian story yet it seems like it was set in America. Also Ned was an Australian yet he has an Irish accent...it is the worst film I have seen in a long time",
    "From the very beginning, the political theme of this film is so obvious and heavy handed, that the outcome is entirely predictable. Any good textbook on writing screenplays will advise layering of characters, incorporating character arcs, and three act structure. In this film you will find none of that. The police are the baddies, and consequently are shown as shallow, incompetent and cowards. It never seems to occur to the makers of this film that police might be honourable citizens who see joining the police as a good way to contribute to the wellbeing of society.<br /><br />The viewer gets no opportunity to make up his or her mind on whether Ned Kelly is a good guy or a ruthless villain. The film opens with him being arrested for stealing a horse, but we get no clue as to his guilt or innocence. We see him walk through the door of a gaol, but only know that he has been inside for three years when we hear this much later in some dialogue.<br /><br />This film contains many shots of Ned looking at the camera with a serious expression. I found the film a real chore to watch. It is the direction for modern films, and this one put me off watching any more.",
    "I guess I was attracted to this film both because of the sound of the story and the leading actor, so I gave it a chance, from director Gregor Jordan (Buffalo Soldiers). Basically Ned Kelly (Heath Ledger) is set up by the police, especially Superintendent Francis Hare (Geoffrey Rush), he is forced to go on the run forming a gang and go against them to clear his own and his family's names. That's really all I can say about the story, as I wasn't paying the fullest attention to be honest. Also starring Orlando Bloom as Joseph Byrne, Naomi Watts as Julia Cook, Laurence Kinlan as Dan Kelly, Philip Barantini as Steve Hart, Joel Edgerton as Aaron Sherritt, Kiri Paramore as Constable Fitzpatrick, Kerry Condon as Kate Kelly, Emily Browning as Grace Kelly and Rachel Griffiths as Susan Scott. Ledger makes a pretty good performance, for what it's worth, and the film does have it's eye-catching moments, particularly with a gun battle towards the end, but I can't say I enjoyed it as I didn't look at it all. Okay!",
    "I don't quite get the rating for The Amati Girls and I think I was REALLY kind giving it a 4 out of 10. What could otherwise have been a wonderful story with actually a set of more or less decent actors became a total farce in my eyes. There are so many clichés in that flick, the women's hair is just awful and most of the scenes are more than unrealistic or seem fake. There's no real passion in this movie but a bunch of actors over-acting over any limits that it hurts. It's not funny enough to be a comedy, it's too fake-sad to really touch, so in my eyes it's just not good. Watching it I couldn't believe how something like that made it to my TV set in my living room in Switzerland. But.. maybe it still was OK and it just got lost in translation? Who knows. Definitely one of the oddest movies I've ever seen and this certainly not in a good way! Sorry.",
    "This movie was awful. The ending was absolutely horrible. There was no plot to the movie whatsoever. The only thing that was decent about the movie was the acting done by Robert DuVall and James Earl Jones. Their performances were excellent! The only problem was that the movie did not do their acting performances any justice. If the script would have come close to capturing a halfway decent story, it would be worth watching. Instead, Robert DuVall's and James Earl Jones' performances are completely wasted on a god awful storyline...or lack thereof. Not only was I left waiting throughout the movie for something to happen to make the movie....well an actual movie...not just utterless dialog between characters for what ended up being absolutely no reason. It was nothing more than common dialog that would have taken place back in that period of time. There was nothing special about any of the characters. The only thing special was how Robert DuVall portrayed a rambling, senile, drunk, old man. Nothing worthy happens during the entire movie including the end. When the movie ended, I sat amazed...amazed that I sat through the entire movie waiting for something of interest to happen to make watching the movie worth while. It never happened! The cast of characters suddenly started rolling making it apparent that the movie really was over and I realized that I had just wasted 2 hours of my life watching a movie with absolutely no plot and no meaning. It wasn't even a story. The entire movie takes place in a day's worth of time. That's it. It was one day in the life (and death) of some Southerners on a plantation. How much of a story can take place in a single day (other than the movie Training Day)? The acting performances by the entire cast were excellent, but they were grossly wasted on such a disappointment of a movie...if you can even call it a movie.",
    "Holy crap. This was the worst film I have seen in a long time. All the performances are fine, but there is no plot. Really! No plot! A bunch of clowns talk about this and that and that's your film. Ug... Robert Duvall's character is senile and keeps asking the same people the same qestions over and over. This earns him the same responses over and over. I am pretty sure this film got upto a six because people think they should like it. Good performances with famous and well regarded actors, but the actual complete work is a steamy turd. Well, maybe that's a bit deceptive since steam rising from a fresh pile sounds a little like something happening and in this film NOTHING HAPPENS! Sack",
    "SWING! is an important film because it's one of the remaining Black-produced and acted films from the 1930s. Many of these films have simply deteriorated so badly that they are unwatchable, but this one is in fairly good shape. It's also a nice chance to see many of the talented Black performers of the period just after the heyday of the old Cotton Club--a time all but forgotten today.<br /><br />Unfortunately, while the film is historically important and has some lovely performances, it's also a mess. The main plot is very similar to the Hollywood musicals of the era--including a prima donna who is going to ruin the show and the surprise unknown who appears from no where to save the day. However, the writing is just god-awful and a bit trashy at times--and projects images of Black America that some might find a bit demeaning. This is because before the plot really gets going, you are treated to a no-account bum who lives off his hard working wife (a popular stereotype of the time) and when he is caught with a hussy (who, by the way, totally overplays this role), they have a fight which looks like a scene from WWE Smackdown! And, the one lady wants to cut the other lady with a straight razor--a trashy scene indeed! Later in the film, when the prima donna is behaving abominably, her husband punches her in the face and everyone applauds him! It seems like the film, at times, wants to appeal to the lowest common denominator in the audience PLUS they can't even do this well--with some of the worst acting I've seen in a very long time.<br /><br />Still, if you can look past a lousy production in just about every way (with trashy characters, bad acting and direction and poor writing), this one might be worth a peek so you can see excellent singing and tap dancing--as well as to catch a glimpse of forgotten Black culture. Just don't say I didn't warn you about the acting--it's really, really bad!",
    "There's not a drop of sunshine in \"The Sunshine Boys\", which makes the title of this alleged comedy Neil Simon's sole ironic moment. Simon, who adapted the script from his play (which goes uncredited), equates old age with irrational behavior--and, worse, clumsy, galumphing, mean-spirited irrational behavior. Walter Matthau is merciless on us playing an aged vaudeville performer talked into reuniting with former comedy partner George Burns for a television special (it's said they were a team for 43 years, which begs the question \"how long did vaudeville last, anyway?\"). Burns, who won a Supporting Oscar, has the misfortune of coming to the film some thirty minutes in, after which time Matthau has already blasted the material to hell and back. The noisier the movie gets, the less tolerable and watchable it is. Director Herbert Ross only did solid work when he wasn't coupled with one of Neil Simon's screenplays; here, Ross sets up gags like a thudding amateur, hammering away at belligerent routines which fail to pay off (such as semi-incoherent Matthau showing up at a mechanic's garage to audition for a TV commercial). At this point, Matthau was still too young for this role, and he over-compensates by slouching and hollering. It was up to Ross and Simon to tone down the character, to nuance his temperament to give \"The Sunshine Boys\" some sunniness, yet Walter continues to project as if we'd all gone deaf. The picture looks terribly drab and crawls along at a spiritless pace; one loses hope for it early on. *1/2 from ****",
    "I like Goldie Hawn and wanted another one of her films, so when I saw Protocol for $5.50 at Walmart I purchased it. Although mildly amusing, the film never really hits it a stride. Some scenes such as a party scene in a bar just goes on for too long and really has no purpose.<br /><br />Then, of course, there is the preachy scene at the end of the film which gives the whole film a bad taste as far as I'm concerned. I don't think this scene added to the movie at all. I don't like stupid comedies trying to teach me a lesson, written by some '60's burn out especially!<br /><br />In the end, although I'm glad to possess another Hawn movie, I'm not sure it was really worth the money I paid for it!",
    "Protocol is an implausible movie whose only saving grace is that it stars Goldie Hawn along with a good cast of supporting actors. The story revolves around a ditzy cocktail waitress who becomes famous after inadvertently saving the life of an Arab dignitary. The story goes downhill halfway through the movie and Goldie's charm just doesn't save this movie. Unless you are a Goldie Hawn fan don't go out of your way to see this film.",
    "What does the \" Executive producer \" do in a movie . If I remember correctly it's the person who raised the financial backing to make the movie . You might notice in a great number of movies starring Sean Connery that he is also the executive producer which meant Connery himself raised the money since he is a major player . Unfortunately it should also be pointed out that a great number of movies \" starring Sean Connery were solely made because he managed to raise the money since he's a major Hollywood player , it's usually an indication that when the credits read that the executive producer and the star of the movie are one and the same the movie itself is nothing more than a star vehicle with the story/screenplay not being up to scratch <br /><br />PROTOCOL follows the saga of one Sunny Davis a kooky bimboesque cocktail waitress who saves a visiting dignitary and as a reward gets made a top diplomat . Likely ? As things progress Ms Davis ( Who has problems being able to string two sentences together ) finds herself in more outlandish and less likely situations . When I say that PROTOCOL stars Goldie Hawn who is also the film's executive producer do you understand what I'm saying about the story/screenplay not being up to scratch ? Exactly",
    "Outlandish premise that rates low on plausibility and unfortunately also struggles feebly to raise laughs or interest. Only Hawn's well-known charm allows it to skate by on very thin ice. Goldie's gotta be a contender for an actress who's done so much in her career with very little quality material at her disposal...<br /><br />",
    "There are only two movies I would give a 1/10 to, this stinker and \"The Man who Fell to Earth.\" I remember seeing Protocol at a theater in the early 80s when I was in high school. The script is insulting to anyone (including a high school student's) intelligence. It completely lost me with the \"hillarious\" gag of someone getting shot in the butt. Goldie Hawn is supposed to be charming but comes across as vapid and moronic. Then there are offensive stereotypes about Arabs, followed by Goldie winning over everyone by spouting populist dribble. The acting was terrible, including Goldie Hawn's. I could not stand to see another movie she was in until IMO she redeemed herself in Everyone Says I Love You. This is the kind of movie you make if you want to put no effort into screenplay writing. The worst.",
    "The only good thing about this movie was the shot of Goldie Hawn standing in her little french cut bikini panties and struggling to keep a dozen other depraved women from removing her skimpy little cotton top while she giggled and cooed. Ooooof! Her loins rival those of Nina Hartley. This movie came out when I was fourteen and that shot nearly killed me. I'd forgotten about it all tucked away in the naughty Roladex of my mind until seeing it the other day on TV, where they actually blurred her midsection in that scene, good grief, reminding me what a smokin' hottie of a woman Goldie Hawn was in the '80s. Kurt Russell must have had a fun life.",
    "I'm studying Catalan, and was delighted to find El Mar, a movie with mostly Catalan dialogue, at my art-house video store.<br /><br />Hmmm... not so delighted to have seen it.<br /><br />Yes, as other reviewers have said, it's well-made, and beautifully photographed. Although the opening sequence of the children is shockingly violent, it's well-acted and convincing. (For the most part, that is... Would the Mallorquins strip a corpse in preparation for burial right in the middle of the town square, in full view of the dead man's 10-year-old boy?) Oh, well... minor detail. Up to this point, it had something of the feel of a non-magical Pan's Labyrinth, also set in the Spanish Civil War.<br /><br />Fast-forward, and the three children who survived the opening incident have come of age. Francisca is a nun working at a tuberculosis sanatorium and the two boys, Manuel and Ramallo, both are patients. I know, but hey, coincidences happen.<br /><br />The problem, as with so many Spanish movies (apologies to Almodovar fans), is that with one exception (Francisca) the characters are just so dang *weird*. Their motivations, personalities, and dialogue are often simply incoherent.<br /><br />What's more, it descends into some horrific wretched excess. Be prepared for LOTS of pain and LOTS of blood. The reviewer who called it a \"potboiler\" is quite on track. If it had been made 40 years ago, the poster would've said: SEE FORBIDDEN LOVE!! RAPE!! MURDER!! MUTILATION!! FANATICISM!! ANIMAL CRUELTY!! BETRAYAL!! <br /><br />The opening sequence is not nearly enough to make the personalities and relationships of the characters believable. To work, this should have had multiple flashbacks to flesh out the characters. As it is, it seems a bizarre and depressing cross between \"Brother Sun, Sister Moon\" and \"Pulp Fiction.\" If that sounds like something you've got to see, by all means, enjoy. I think I go with something that doesn't make me feel I need to take a shower to wash off the gore and gloom.<br /><br />As for the Catalan, it's the Mallorqui dialect, fairly different than the Barcelona dialect, though I was surprised by the comment that said that even Barcelonans apparently needed Catalan subtitles to understand it.",
    "I was excited to view a Cataluña´s film in the Berlin´s competition. But after the presentation I was total disappointed and furious. Too much blood, too much time, too much themes for nothing. The Spanish Civil War, like every war, was horrible. The revenge, a very human behavior, not pretty at all, is shown in uncountable films and plays, as well as the relations between homosexuals and the scepticism in Spain about Catholicism . But what Mr Villaronga try, is a pseudo tragedy that can belongs to the worst of the film´s history. It is really a pity to see Angela Molina in this movie. I advise nobody under no circumstances to go to see this film.",
    "this film was a major letdown. the level of relentless cruelty and violence in this film was very disturbing. some scenes were truly unnecessarily ugly and mean-spirited. the main characters were impossible to identify with or even sympathize with. the lead protagonist's character was as slimy as they come. the sickroom/hothouse atmosphere lent itself to over-the-top theatrics. little or nothing could be learned about the Spanish civil war from this film. fortunately, i've been to spain and realize this is not realistic! in addition, the use of same-sex attraction as a lurid \"horror\" was also very offensive and poorly handled, while the DVD is being packaged and advertised to attract gay viewers. the actors seemed uncomfortable in their roles,as if they were trying to distance themselves from this mess.i guess if you like watching children and pets being brutally killed,this film might especially appeal to you.",
    "Three part \"horror\" film with some guy in a boarded up house imploring the viewer not to go \"out there\" and (unfortunately) gives us three tales to prove why.<br /><br />The first story involves a young couple in a car accident who meet up with two psychos. It leads up to two totally predictable twists. Still, it's quick (about 15 minutes), violent, well-acted and well-done. Predictable but enjoyable.<br /><br />The second involves a man on the run after stealing a large amount of money. His car breaks down, he's attacked by a dog and stumbles into a nearby clinic. VERY obvious, badly done and extremely slow. Even at 30 minutes this is too long. Good acting though.<br /><br />The third is just barely a horror story. It involves a beautiful, lonely woman looking for Mr. Right. It has beautiful set designs, a nice erotic feel and a nice sex scene. But (again) predictable and not even remotely scary.<br /><br />It ends very stupidly.<br /><br />All in all, the first one is worth watching, but that's it. Tune in for that one then turn it off.",
    "A very cheesy and dull road movie, with the intention to be hip and modern, shown in the editing style and some weird camera angles, resulting only in sleepiness. <br /><br />The cast is wasted, the writing is stupid and pretentious. The only thing worthwhile is the top-notch Lalo Schifrin's soundtrack, really cool and also the opening sequence, very original and interesting. <br /><br />Run if you can, the bad opinions and comments about this flick are totally deserved; it is really pure garbage. Of course that this has its charm, of watching a movie which everybody would not drop the beer glass on if it were on fire, but save it for a stormy day where you have absolutely nothing else to do.",
    "There are some nice shots in this film, it catches some of the landscapes with such a beautiful light, in fact the cinematography is probably it's best asset.<br /><br />But it's basically more of a made for TV movie, and although it has a lot of twists and turns in the plot, which keeps it quite interesting viewing, there are no subtitles and key plot developments are unveiled in Spanish, so non Spanish speakers will be left a little lost.<br /><br />I had it as a Xmas gift, as it's a family trait to work through the films of a actor we find talented, and Matthew Mconaughey was just awesome in \"A Time to kill\" , and the \"The Newton Boys \" so I expressed I wanted to see more of his work.<br /><br />However although it says on the DVD box it is a Matthew Mconaughey film and uses this as a marketing ploy, he has a few lines and is on screen for not very minutes at the end of the film, he is basically an extra and he doesn't exactly light up the screen while he is on, so die hard fans, really not worth it from that point of view.<br /><br />The films star though, Patrick McGaw is great though and very easy on the eye, and his character is just so nice and kind and caring, a true saint of a guy, he'd be well written into a ROM com.<br /><br />So for true Mcconaughey acting brilliance of the ones I've seen, I'd recommend, \"A Time to kill\" , \"The Newton Boys \" \"Frailty\", \"How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days\", \"Edtv\" and \"Amistad\" and avoid too \"Larger Than Life\" and \"Angels in the Outfield\" unless you feel like a kids film or have kids around as neither of these are indicative of his talent, but are quite amusing films for children, again MM is really nothing more that a supporting artist with just a few if any lines.<br /><br />As for Scorpion Springit's not a bad film but it also isn't screen stealing either.",
    "I have been looking for this film for ages because it is quite rare to find as it was one of the video nasties. I finally found it on DVD at the end of last year it is a very low budget movie The story is set around amazon jungle tribes that are living in fear of the devil. Laura Crawford is a model who is kidnapped by a gang of thugs while she is working in South America. They take her into the jungle Laura is guarded by some ridiculous native who calls himself \"The Devil\" she has to go though all unpleasant things until they are happy. Maidens are Chained up. The devil demonstrates eating flesh in a horrible manner. Peter Weston, is the devil hunter, who goes into the jungle to try and rescue her,",
    "As the number of Video Nasties I've yet to see dwindles, this little pile of garbage popped up on my \"to rent\" list when I saw it was available.<br /><br />The premise involves a fashion model or something being kidnapped and taken into the jungle to be held for ransom by a motley crew of idiots. Some other goof gets hired to bring her back and is given a sack of money to use as a bargaining chip, though if he returns with the girl and all the money, he gets a significant cut. He's brought a helicopter and pilot with him and, wow, that pilot is one of the worst actors EVER! Granted, they are all totally terrible and the dubbing will make you cry blood. After stealing away into the jungle, we learn that nearby is a cannibal cult whose flesheating earthbound god wanders the woods like a human King Kong looking for tribeswomen to ravage and devour. Now, this fellow is just a naked guy with some of the worst makeup ever, ping-pong balls for eyes and that's pretty much it. His growls and groans are an everpresent feature on the soundtrack, and I found myself muting much of those scenes.<br /><br />Oh, did I forget to mention the almost constant nudity? This is probably the main reason this film was banned, though there is one specific scene, about one second long, where the god attacks a girl and pulls her guts out, but it's not a redeeming factor for gore fans. Also, Jess Franco goes beyond the usual T and A and shows lengthy close-ups of female genitals, and, sadly, male as well. So, if you want \"fair\" in terms of exploitation, you got it.<br /><br />I can't recommend this trash to anyone. It's not even the good bad movie. It's just atrociously padded trash that only a Video Nasty fan will probably view and even then, if you are making your way through the list, leave this for the very last. If you watch it first, you may get the notion that this is the norm for the list, which is certainly not true.",
    "Not sure if I'm referring to those who labeled this a video nasty or to the director...\"Devil Hunter\" sure is one bizarre 'horror' movie.<br /><br />The plot is a loosey goosey combo of superior films like \"Cannibal Ferox\" and \"Cut and Run.\" Chick gets kidnapped in the 'jungle' by a 'tribe' of 'savages.' The jungle looks more like a park somewhere in Mexico. The tribe is like a group of hippies who walk around in Party City-style Halloween costume renditions of tribal garb. And the savages range in race from white to Asian to black to hispanic. I suppose Franco just grabbed anyone who looked even slightly ethnic for this romp.<br /><br />To make matters worse, this film has ultra-minimal gore, no real scares and a lot of unnecessary penis. Not fun. I can find something to like in just about any sleazy Italian or Euro-trash film; this one just fell WAY short.<br /><br />2 out of 10, kids.",
    "This video nasty was initially banned in Britain, and allowed in last November without cuts.<br /><br />It features the Playboy Playmate of the Month October 1979, Ursula Buchfellner. The opening cuts back and forth between Buchfellner and foggy jungle pictures. I am not sure what the purpose of that was. It would have been much better to focus on the bathtub scene.<br /><br />Laura (Buchfellner) is kidnapped and held in the jungle for ransom. Peter (Al Cliver - The Beyond, Zombie) is sent to find her and the ransom. Of course, one of the kidnappers (Antonio de Cabo) manages to pass the time productively, while another (Werner Pochath) whines incessantly.<br /><br />The ransom exchange goes to hell, and Laura runs into the jungle. Will Peter save her before the cannibals have a meal? Oh, yes, there are cannibals in this jungle. Why do you think it was a video nasty! Muriel Montossé is found by Peter and his partner (Antonio Mayans - Angel of Death) on the kidnapper's boat. Montossé is very comfortably undressed. Peter leaves them and goes off alone to find Laura, who has been captured by now. They pass the time having sex, and don't see the danger approaching. Guts, anyone? Great fight between Peter and the naked devil (Burt Altman).<br /><br />Blood, decapitation, guts, lots of full frontal, some great writhing by the cannibal priestess (Aline Mess), and the line, \"They tore her heart out,\" which is hilarious if you see the film.",
    "Of the three titles from Jess Franco to find their way onto the Official DPP Video Nasty list (Devil Hunter, Bloody Moon and Women Behind Bars) this is perhaps the least deserving of notoriety, being a dreadfully dull jungle clunker enlivened only very slightly by a little inept gore, a gratuitous rape scene, and loads of nudity.<br /><br />Gorgeous blonde Ursula Buchfellner plays movie star Laura Crawford who is abducted by a gang of ruthless kidnappers and taken to a remote tropical island inhabited by a savage tribe who worship the 'devil god' that lurks in the jungle (a big, naked, bulging-eyed native who likes to eat the hearts of nubile female sacrifices).<br /><br />Employed by Laura's agent to deliver a $6million ransom, brave mercenary Peter Weston (Al Cliver) and his Vietnam vet pilot pal travel to the island, but encounter trouble when the bad guys attempt a double-cross. During the confusion, Laura escapes into the jungle, but runs straight into the arms of the island's natives, who offer her up to their god.<br /><br />Franco directs in his usual torpid style and loads this laughable effort with his usual dreadful trademarks: crap gore, murky cinematography, rapid zooms, numerous crotch shots, out of focus imagery, awful sound effects, and ham-fisted editing. The result is a dire mess that is a real struggle to sit through from start to finish (It took me a couple of sittings to finish the thing), and even the sight of the luscious Buchfellner in all of her natural glory ain't enough to make me revisit this film in a hurry.",
    "How can you tell that a horror movie is terrible? when you can't stop laughing about it of course! The plot has been well covered by other reviewers, so I'll just add a few things on the hilarity of it all.<br /><br />Some reviews have placed the location in South America, others in Africa, I thought it was in some random island in the Pacific. Where exactly does this take place, seems to be a mystery. The cannibal tribe is conformed by a couple of black women some black men, and a man who looks like a young Frank Zappa banging the drums... the Devil God is a large black man with a terrible case of pink eyes.<br /><br />One of the \"freakiest\" moments in the film is when, \"Pablito\" find his partner hanging from a tree covered in what seems to be an orange substance that I assume is blood, starts screaming for minutes on and on (that's actually funny), and then the head of his partner falls in the ground and \"Pablito\" kicks it a bit for what I assume is \"shits n' giggles\" and the eyes actually move...<br /><br />But, of course, then the \"freak\" is gone when you realize the eyes moved because the movie is just bad...<br /><br />I hadn't laughed like this in a loooong while, and I definitely recommend this film for a Sunday afternoon with your friends and you have nothing to do... grab a case of beers and start watching this film, you'll love it! If you are looking for a real horror or gore movie, though... don't' bother.",
    "An actress making a movie in Africa is kidnapped and taken into the jungle where she is held for ransom. The producer hires some one to go and bring her back. Complicating everything are the cannibals in the jungle who worship a really ugly looking \"god\" who likes to eat naked women.<br /><br />This is a gory sleazy movie. There is copious amounts of nudity and violence, not to mention violence against nude people. Its an exploitation film designed to appeal to the deepest darkest parts of our being, and if the movie wasn't so boring this film would be a classic. Lets face it, despite the gore, the nasty sex and abuse,and the ugly monster this movie is a snoozer. The pacing is all off kilter and it puts you out. There are multiple plot lines that all seem to be happening separately from each other, even though its ultimately all one story. Worst of all, almost no one says anything. Most of the minimal dialog concerns the cruelty or one characters protestations that \"I'll do what I want\". Its such a quiet and dull movie that if it weren't for the frequent screams of the victims I'd recommend this as a sleep aide.<br /><br />This is a movie to avoid unless you need sleep, or unless you need to see every Euro-cannibal movie.<br /><br />(An aside. VideoAsia just released this as part of their Terror Tales series. Their print is oddly letter-boxed which looks to be the result of taking their print from a Japanese source (there is fogging) that was cropped to remove the subtitles. Their print also has no opening titles)",
    "or anyone who was praying for the sight of Al Cliver wrestling a naked, 7ft tall black guy into a full nelson, your film has arrived! Film starlet Laura Crawford (Ursula Buchfellner) is kidnapped by a group who demand the ransom of $6 million to be delivered to their island hideaway. What they don't count on is rugged Vietnam vet Peter Weston (Cliver) being hired by a film producer to save the girl. And what they really didn't count on was a local tribe that likes to offer up young women to their monster cannibal god with bloodshot bug eyes.<br /><br />Pretty much the same filming set up as CANNIBALS, this one fares a bit better when it comes to entertainment value, thanks mostly a hilarious dub track and the impossibly goofy monster with the bulging eyes (Franco confirms they were split ping pong balls on the disc's interview). Franco gets a strong EuroCult supporting cast including Gisela Hahn (CONTAMINATION) and Werner Pochath (whose death is one of the most head-scratching things I ever seen as a guy who is totally not him is shown - in close up - trying to be him). The film features tons of nudity and the gore (Tempra paint variety) is there. The highlight for me was the world's slowly fistfight between Cliver and Antonio de Cabo in the splashing waves. Sadly, ol' Jess pads this one out to an astonishing (and, at times, agonizing) 1 hour and 40 minutes when it should have run 80 minutes tops. <br /><br />For the most part, the Severin DVD looks pretty nice but there are some odd ghosting images going on during some of the darker scenes. Also, one long section of dialog is in Spanish with no subs (they are an option, but only when you listen to the French track). Franco gives a nice 16- minute interview about the film and has much more pleasant things to say about Buchfellner than his CANNIBALS star Sabrina Siani.",
    "Devil Hunter gained notoriety for the fact that it's on the DPP 'Video Nasty' list, but it really needn't have been. Many films on the list where there for God (and DPP) only known reasons, and while this isn't the tamest of the bunch; there isn't a lot here that warrants banning...which is a shame because I never would have sat through it where it not for the fact that it's on 'the shopping list'. The plot actually gives the film a decent base - or at least more of a decent base than most cannibal films - and it follows an actress who is kidnapped and dragged off into the Amazon jungle. A hunter is then hired to find her, but along the way he has to brave the natives, lead by a man who calls himself \"The Devil\" (hence the title). The film basically just plods along for eighty five minutes and there really aren't many scenes of interest. It's a real shame that Jess Franco ended up making films like this because the man clearly has talent; as seen by films such as The Diabolical Dr Z, Venus in Furs, Faceless and She Kills in Ecstasy, but unfortunately his good films are just gems amongst heaps of crap and Devil Hunter is very much a part of the crap. I saw this film purely because I want to be able to say I've seen everything on the DPP's list (just two more to go!), and I'm guessing that's why most other people who have seen it, saw it. But if you're not on the lookout for Nasties; there really is no reason to bother with this one.",
    "This film seemed way too long even at only 75 minutes. The problem with jungle horror films is that there is always way too much footage of people walking (through the jungle, up a rocky cliff, near a river or lake) to pad out the running time. The film is worth seeing for the laughable and naked native zombie with big bulging, bloody eyes which is always accompanied on the soundtrack with heavy breathing and lots of reverb. Eurotrash fans will be plenty entertained by the bad English dubbing, gratuitous female flesh and very silly makeup jobs on the monster and native extras. For a zombie/cannibal flick this was pretty light on the gore but then I probably didn't see an uncut version.",
    "Not only is it a disgustingly made low-budget bad-acted movie, but the plot itself is just STUPID!!!<br /><br />A mystic man that eats women? (And by the looks, not virgin ones)<br /><br />Ridiculous!!! If you´ve got nothing better to do (like sleeping) you should watch this. Yeah right.",
    "This is the worst thing the TMNT franchise has ever spawned. I was a kid when this came out and I still thought it was deuce, even though I liked the original cartoon.<br /><br />There's this one scene I remember when the mafia ape guy explains to his minions what rhetorical questions are. It's atrocious. Many fans hate on the series for including a female turtle, but that didn't bother me. So much so that I didn't even remember her until I read about the show recently. All in all, it's miserably forgettable.<br /><br />The only okay thing was the theme song. Guilty pleasure, they call it... Nananana ninja...",
    "This is the biggest insult to TMNT ever. Fortunantely, officially Venus does not exist in canon TMNT. There will never be a female turtle, this took away from the tragic tale of 4 male unique mutants who will never have a family of their own, once gone no more. The biggest mistake was crossing over Power Rangers to TMNT with a horrible episode; the turtle's voices were WRONG and they all acted out of character. They could have done such a better job, better designs and animatronics and NO VENUS. <br /><br />don't bother with this people...it's cringe worthy material. the lip flap was slow and unnatural looking. they totally disrespected shredder. the main baddie, some dragonlord dude was corny. the turtles looked corny with things hanging off their bodies, what's with the thing around raph's thigh? the silly looking sculpted plastrons!? <br /><br />If they looked normal, acted in character and got rid of Venus, got rid of the stupid kiddie cartoon sounds...and better writing it could have been good.",
    "I did not like the idea of the female turtle at all since 1987 we knew the TMNT to be four brothers with their teacher Splinter and their enemies and each one of the four brothers are named after the great artists name like Leonardo , Michelangleo, Raphel and Donatello so Venus here doesn't have any meaning or playing any important part and I believe that the old TMNT series was much more better than that new one which contains Venus As a female turtle will not add any action to the story we like the story of the TMNT we knew in 1987 to have new enemies in every part is a good point to have some action but to have a female turtle is a very weak point to have some action, we wish to see more new of TMNT series but just as the same characters we knew in 1987 without that female turtle.",
    "This film is terrible. You don't really need to read this review further. If you are planning on watching it, suffice to say - don't (unless you are studying how not to make a good movie).<br /><br />The acting is horrendous... serious amateur hour. Throughout the movie I thought that it was interesting that they found someone who speaks and looks like Michael Madsen, only to find out that it is actually him! A new low even for him!!<br /><br />The plot is terrible. People who claim that it is original or good have probably never seen a decent movie before. Even by the standard of Hollywood action flicks, this is a terrible movie.<br /><br />Don't watch it!!! Go for a jog instead - at least you won't feel like killing yourself.",
    "Terrible movie. Nuff Said.<br /><br />These Lines are Just Filler. The movie was bad. Why I have to expand on that I don't know. This is already a waste of my time. I just wanted to warn others. Avoid this movie. The acting sucks and the writing is just moronic. Bad in every way. The only nice thing about the movie are Deniz Akkaya's breasts. Even that was ruined though by a terrible and unneeded rape scene. The movie is a poorly contrived and totally unbelievable piece of garbage.<br /><br />OK now I am just going to rag on IMDb for this stupid rule of 10 lines of text minimum. First I waste my time watching this offal. Then feeling compelled to warn others I create an account with IMDb only to discover that I have to write a friggen essay on the film just to express how bad I think it is. Totally unnecessary.",
    "Assuming this won't end up a straight-to-video release, I would have to say void this title at all costs. Unless you're bored of good, well-executed movies, that is. I saw this last night at AFI Dallas, and I left with 20 minutes remaining, simply because I didn't care anymore (about the plot, not about insulting the director...that is awkward). When you can spot a goof only 5 minutes into the movie (a shot out, shattered window before any shots are fired...and then the window breaks with the first shot), things are going to bad. Let's just say this is only an indicator of things to come...unfortunately.<br /><br />I'll spare you all the details, but this is sub-par in every manner, even the half-assed acting by Michael Madsen is disappointing when you're expecting half-assed acting from him. And the rape scene...Christ! \"Shut up and take it\" should never be used in a rape scene. EVER.<br /><br />3/10",
    "Sometimes a movie is so comprehensively awful it has a destructive effect on your morale. You begin to really ask yourself, what does it mean for our society that the standard is so terribly low? Can they honestly expect that we'll endure this many clichés and still be entertained?<br /><br />Of course, it is still a Hollywood mainstay to make the GUN the major character, plot device, and the source of all conflict and resolution in films. Character needs a gun. Gets a gun. Can't do that because he has a gun. Puts his gun down first. OH MY GOD What are we going to do!? He has a gun! He waves it around, acting more malicious than real human beings ever do. He pushes it in someone's face for 90 minutes, shouting questions. The hallmark of any conclusion will be the comforting sound of police sirens. <br /><br />It's a real challenge to make such a tired, hackneyed formula work again; a film has to be very clever and well executed. This one is neither. It has no life and no personality, and it will suck these components from YOU. it will make you feel WORSE about living in the time and space that you do. Really, who needs that!? So yes, I'll say it: I think this may well be the worst film I have ever seen. Anyone who was involved in the making of this sub- mediocre soul killing trash should be publicly embarrassed for the disservice they've done to us all.",
    "I have to congratulate the genius who approved this one. Edward Furlong, you're not as good as you think mate, you can't grab on every piece of low-cost amateur crap, which sole intention has to be to get some bucks.<br /><br />The filming is bad, and I mean BAD. Anyone with a camera would get the same result, or better.<br /><br />The acting, lets just say: don't go to the supermarket looking for actors. The good ones usually come with a degree or, at least, have some damn experience! The director.. Mr. Jon Keeyes, please find your purpose in life, as a director you simply suck. Your directing is poor, the angles are all messed up (not in a good way), the lines seem as if they're being read out of toilet paper, and the damn music.. it always comes up when it shouldn't and goes out for no apparent reason. And don't go for writer either, by the way. Making movies isn't like serving on a coffeshop, it requires art and skill, things I really doubt you'll ever have.<br /><br />Instead of making a badass shootout movie, you should've shot this one back to oblivion and wait 'till something good came up.. Or just go find a job on a coffeshop. You'll have less stress and you'll save movie goers some money and a bad night.<br /><br />vote: 1/10 (my first one)",
    "I rented this one on DVD without any prior knowledge. I was suspicious seeing Michael Madsen appearing in a movie I have never heard of, but it was a freebie, so why not check it out.<br /><br />Well my guess is that Mr. Blonde would very much like to forget he's ever taken part in such a shame of a film.<br /><br />Apparently, if your script and dialogs are terrible, even good actors cannot save the day. Not to mention the amateur actors that flood this film. Too many non-native-English-speakers play parts of native-English-speakers, reading out lines from a script that should have been thrown away and not having been made into a movie. It's unbelievable how unbelievable all the lines in the movie sound. The music is awful and totally out of place, and the whole thing looks and sounds like a poor school play.<br /><br />I recommend you watch it just so you would appreciate other, better, movies. This is why I gave it a 3 instead of the 1 it deserves.",
    "I saw this DVD in my friends house and thought that this was a Turkish action movie with some Hollywood-not very big-names in it. Interested enough I decide to give it a shot later.. It was a tough to bear experience believe me. Then, after finally seeing the credits roll I tought 'We Turks really suck at Hollywood style film making.. This is an insult to the heist|hostage movie genre..' but then wait! I checked some names and no, they were not Turkish names and no, this was not a Turkish movie; on the contrary it was literally shot in America with an American director & crew! That made me thinking-again!- How on earth can you persuade names like Micheal Madsen, Edward Furlong or even Arnold Vosloo to take part in such a project? with money probably.. That kept me thinking further.. How can you raise such amount of money to offer them and a supposedly international cast? Then all my meditation paid off and I came to find the answer.By hiring the cheapest equipment and crew that you can find. And if you still have to difficulty in adjustin your budget then: by writing and directing the movie you are trying to produce-or vice versa I don't have any information on that-. So bottom line this is not a bad movie as everybody are so anxious to present as.. It makes you think -in my case even meditate- and there are a lot of movies outthere that doesn't give even that affect.. This one at least makes you think; It makes you wonder.. It leaves you with disbelief.. and then It makes you wonder again..",
    "What was with all the Turkish actors? No offense but I thought it was all for nothing for all these actors. The film had no script to test any actors acting skill or ability. It demanded next to nothing I bought this film to see Michael Madsen. He is one of my favorite actors but this film was another failure for him. The script was so bad. Their was just nothing to sink your teeth into and all the characters were two dimensional. Madsen tried to act like a hard ass but the script and direction didn't even allow him to do enough with his character to make it more interesting or 3 dimensional.<br /><br />Even the sound effects of the gunfight at the beginning of the film sounded like the noise of paint ball guns when they are fired in a skirmish. It was really weird and they didn't sound like real guns. A video game had better sound effects than this film. There was also a really annoying bloke at the beginning of the film who was a member of the robbery gang. He had this American whining voice like a girl shouting lines like \"Lets get the F#$k out of here\" and What are we going to do man\". He sounded like a girl. As a positive It was funny to watch and it made me laugh too. For a few seconds. Whoo Hoo ! Dumb Film. Poor Madsen. He will bounce back...",
    "This movie was terrible. at first i just read the plot summary and it looked OK, so i watched it. The acting was TERRIBLE. it was like the actor were almost camera shy. everything seemed fake. i feel bad for Edward Furlong, terminator 2 was my favorite a few years ago.. I've watched it at least 20 times....<br /><br />the plot was also crap. the writers were probably sleep deprived when they came up with the lines.<br /><br />on the plus side, it's the good kind of bad movie. the one you keep watching just to see how much worst could it will get, so that later you can tell other people how you couldn't believe how terrible the movie was.<br /><br />i think everybody should watch this, so that then we could appreciate better other, REAL, movies.",
    "I am a big fan of Arnold Vosloo. Finally seeing him as the star of a recent movie, not just a bit part, made me happy.<br /><br />Unfortunately I took film appreciation in college and the only thing I can say that I didn't like was that the film was made in an abandoned part of town and there was no background traffic or lookie loos.<br /><br />I have to say that the acting leaves something to be desired, but Arnold is an excellent actor, I have to chalk it up to lousy direction and the supporting cast leaves something to be desired.<br /><br />I love Arnold Vosloo, and he made the film viewable. Otherwise, I would have written it off as another lousy film.<br /><br />I found the rape scene brutal and unnecessary, but the actors that got away at the end were pretty good. But the sound effects of the shoot-out were pretty bad. There are some glitches in the film (continuity) but they are overlookable considering the low-caliber of the film.<br /><br />All in all I enjoyed the film, because Arnold Vosloo was in it.<br /><br />Jackie",
    "This is an art film that was either made in 1969 or 1972 (the National Film Preservation Foundation says 1969 and IMDb says 1972). Regardless of the exact date, the film definitely appears to be very indicative of this general time period--with some camera-work and pop art stylings that are pure late 60s-early 70s.<br /><br />The film consists of three simple images that are distorted using different weird camera tricks. These distorted images are accompanied by music and there is absolutely no dialog or plot of any sort. This was obviously intended as almost like a form of performance art, and like most performance art, it's interesting at first but quickly becomes tiresome. The film, to put it even more bluntly, is a total bore and would appeal to no one but perhaps those who made the film, their family and friends and perhaps a few people just too hip and \"with it\" to be understood by us mortals.",
    "Nine minutes of psychedelic, pulsating, often symmetric abstract images, are enough to drive anyone crazy. I did spot a full-frame eye at the start, and later some birds silhouetted against other colors. It was just not my cup of tea. It's about 8½ minutes too long.",
    "There are lots of extremely good-looking people in this movie. That's probably the best thing about it. Perhaps that even makes it worth watching.<br /><br />\"Loaded\" tells the story of Tristan Price (Jesse Metcalfe), a young man who's about to make his mark on the world. He's the son of a well-to-do family with a good reputation, and he's on his way to law school. But like so many such settings, things aren't quite as perfect as they appear. The expectations in this family far outweigh the love. Except for school, Tristan's father rarely lets him leave the house. This seems to be the result of some past traumatic event that shook the family, which is partially revealed through flashbacks but isn't spelled out until the very end. Tristan's claustrophobic environment causes him to let loose in very extreme ways at the first possible opportunity, when his friends take him out to a strip club to celebrate his graduation. The celebration soon follows some strippers back to a beach house party, and from there, Tristan befriends Sebastian Cole (Corey Large), who pulls him into a drug dealing underworld.<br /><br />While technically well-made, this movie suffers from a lackluster script and a storyline that isn't very engaging. Also counting against this film are some constant camera tricks that generally seemed annoying and out-of-place, such as slow-motion, fast-motion, freeze-frames and echos. These are the types of effects a director might normally utilize to show a character's perspective while on drugs, except in this case they seem to have been sporadically tossed in at random points, in some cheap attempt at style.<br /><br />Despite its cast of relative unknowns, performances were good all around, most notably with respect to the main antagonist (Corey Large). I suspect we'll be seeing at least a couple of these people in bigger and better projects in the future.<br /><br />Of course, when mentioning the actors, I must mention their looks. Rating based on hotness, this movies scores an 11. The women in this movie are incredible-looking and almost distract you from what a boring movie you're watching. I'm sure the male characters are also quite attractive, but you'll have to ask someone else to comment on that.<br /><br />Overall, I can't recommend this movie, not for buying, renting, or even seeing for free. It's unfortunately just not worth the effort it takes to sit through.",
    "This is it. This is the one. This is the worst movie ever made. Ever. It beats everything. I have never seen worse. Retire the trophy and give it to these people.....there's just no comparison.<br /><br />Even three days after watching this (for some reason I still don't know why) I cannot believe how insanely horrific this movie is/was. Its so bad. So far from anything that could be considered a movie, a story or anything that should have ever been created and brought into our existence.<br /><br />This made me question whether or not humans are truly put on this earth to do good. It made me feel disgusted with ourselves and our progress as a species in this universe. This type of movie sincerely hurts us as a society. We should be ashamed. I really cannot emphasize that our global responsibility as people living here and creating art, is that we need to prevent the creation of these gross distortions of our reality for our own good. It's an embarrassment. I don't know how on earth any of these actors, writers, or the director of this film sleeps at night knowing that they had a role in making \"Loaded\". I don't know what type of disgusting monsters enjoy watching these types of movies.<br /><br />That being said, I love a good \"bad\" movie. I love Shark Attack 3, I love Bad Taste, they are HILARIOUS. I tell all my friends to see them because they are \"bad\".<br /><br />But this.......this crosses the line of \"bad\" into a whole new dimension. This is awkward bad. This is the bad where you know everything that is going to happen, every line, every action, every death, every sequence BEFORE they happen; and not just like a second or two before, I mean like, after watching the first 5 minutes before.<br /><br />Every cheesy editing \"effect\" is shamelessly used over and over again to a sickening point. I really never want to see the \"shaky\" camera \"drug buzz rush\" effect or jump cuts or swerve cuts or ANY FANCY CUT EVER AGAIN EVER. This is meticulously boring, repetitive and just tortures the audience.<br /><br />But.......and let me be specific here, the most DISTURBING thing about this movie is that given the production, it appears that a somewhat decent amount of money was actually put into this excrement. I personally will grab the shoulders of the director if I ever see him and shake him into submission, demanding that he run home and swallow two-gallons of Drain-O or I will do it for him.<br /><br />If we ever needed a new form of inhumane torture for our war prisoners abroad, just keep showing them this movie in a padded cell over and over again. Trust me, I think they will become more extravagant with suicide methods after the 72nd time of sitting through this.<br /><br />Stop these movies, they are just the most vile of all facets of our society. Please. Stop. NOW.",
    "There are times when finishing a film one wishes to have a refund for the time just spent. This was one of those times. I almost gave up with only 15 minutes left to endure... and I wish I had...<br /><br />The pace that a man goes from a straight-laced, controlled life to one of complete spinelessness and irresponsibility could never be this rapid.<br /><br />From a graduation celebration to the predictable ending Tristan Price (Jesse Metcalfe) man of privilege and culture allows himself to be seduced by a woman, by violence, and by mind altering substances. Of course, the woman part is understandable when observing the talents of the beautiful April (Nathalie Kelley). But the in for a penny in for a pound aspect of the drugs, violence and dedication to a person he has just met is impossible to understand.<br /><br />Frankly, besides being able to stare at Nathalie Kelley and Monica Keena, this film has no redeeming qualities. Save your money, save your time... do anything else...",
    "Weak plot, predictable violence, only semi interesting characters. Like the writer (also one of the stars?) was fictionalizing his own screw ups and added an incredulous fantasies of drugs and murder to make it \"hot\". From the predictable rap and house soundtrack, to the family conflicts, it's poorly acted, stereotypical, and ultimately terribly boring. Even the title has been done before - IMDb lists FIVE movies with the same name released in 2007-2008!! <br /><br />Note: Saw it on Showtime, which listed the synopsis for one of the other movies. Was halfway thru before I realized no one was an undercover cop. Even tho another stereotype, would have made it interesting if it happened.",
    "All I could think of while watching this movie was B-grade slop. Many have spoken about it's redeeming quality is how this film portrays such a realistic representation of the effects of drugs and an individual and their subsequent spiral into a self perpetuation state of unfortunate events. Yet really, the techniques used (as many have already mentioned) were overused and thus unconvincing and irrelevant to the film as a whole.<br /><br />As far as the plot is concerned, it was lacklustre, unimaginative, implausible and convoluted. You can read most other reports on this film and they will say pretty much the same as I would.<br /><br />Granted some of the actors and actresses are attractive but when confronted with such boring action... looks can only carry a film so far. The action is poor and intermittent: a few punches thrown here and there, and a final gunfight towards the end. Nothing really to write home about.<br /><br />As others have said, 'BAD' movies are great to watch for the very reason that they are 'bad', you revel in that fact. This film, however, is a void. It's nothing.<br /><br />Furthermore, if one is really in need of an educational movie to scare people away from drug use then I would seriously recommend any number of other movies out there that board such issues in a much more effective way. 'Requiem For A Dream', 'Trainspotting', 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' and 'Candy' are just a few examples. Though one should also check out some more lighthearted films on the same subject like 'Go' (overall, both serious and funny) and 'Halfbaked'.<br /><br />On a final note, the one possibly redeeming line in this movie, delivered by Vinnie Jones was stolen from 'Lock, Stock and Two Smokling Barrels'. To think that a bit of that great movie has been tainted by 'Loaded' is vile.<br /><br />Overall, I strongly suggest that you save you money and your time by NOT seeing this movie.",
    "If you look at Corey Large's information here on IMDb, apparently there's a movie called \"Reload\" in production (as of June '08) in which he's playing a character named Sebastian Cole.<br /><br />First of all, how does such a crappy movie ever earn a sequel ... and second, didn't Sebastian get killed at the end of \"Loaded\"?<br /><br />I watched this in the wee hours of the morning when I was battling insomnia, and so I was drifting in and out while it was on. I'm sure I missed some plot points, but overall, it seemed really weak. Large's performance was (for me) one of the stronger parts of the film. I'm also a bit surprised at all the people commenting on the beautiful girls, since I thought the actress playing Brooke was pretty, but not exceptional.",
    "This film had a lot of promise, and the plot was relatively interesting, however the actors, director and editors seriously let this film down.<br /><br />I feel bad for the writers, it could have been good. The acting is wooden, very few of the characters are believable.<br /><br />Who ever edited this clearly just learnt some new edit techniques and wanted to splash them all over the film. There are lots of quick 'flashy' edits in almost every scene, which are clearly meant to be symbolic but just end up as annoying.<br /><br />I wanted to like this film and expected there to be a decent resolution to the breakdown of equilibrium but alas no, it left me feeling like I'd wasted my time and the film makers had wasted their money.",
    "This is one of the dumbest films, I've ever seen. It rips off nearly ever type of thriller and manages to make a mess of them all.<br /><br />There's not a single good line or character in the whole mess. If there was a plot, it was an afterthought and as far as acting goes, there's nothing good to say so Ill say nothing. I honestly cant understand how this type of nonsense gets produced and actually released, does somebody somewhere not at some stage think, 'Oh my god this really is a load of shite' and call it a day. Its crap like this that has people downloading illegally, the trailer looks like a completely different film, at least if you have download it, you haven't wasted your time or money Don't waste your time, this is painful.",
    "6/10 Acting, not great but some good acting.<br /><br />4/10 Director, makes some stupid decisions for this film.<br /><br />2/10 Writer, story makes no sense at all and has huge amount of flaws.<br /><br />4/10 Overall score for this movie.<br /><br />Don't waste your time with this film, it's not worth it. I gave 4 for this movie and it may be too much. Characters are so over exaggerated than they can ever be in real life and some pretty unexplainable stuff happens \"storywise\", not in good way. Because of the style this film has been filmed you get bored after 30 minutes (too many special effects: slow motions and camera shakes and fast forwards). It's always good that movie uses music to make the story go smooth but there's too many tracks in this one. In the first hour there is almost 50/50 dialogs and musics",
    "This is really a new low in entertainment. Even though there are a lot worse movies out.<br /><br />In the Gangster / Drug scene genre it is hard to have a convincing storyline (this movies does not, i mean Sebastians motives for example couldn't be more far fetched and worn out cliché.) Then you would also need a setting of character relationships that is believable (this movie does not.) <br /><br />Sure Tristan is drawn away from his family but why was that again? what's the deal with his father again that he has to ask permission to go out at his age? interesting picture though to ask about the lack and need of rebellious behavior of kids in upper class family. But this movie does not go in this direction. Even though there would be the potential judging by the random Backflashes. Wasn't he already down and out, why does he do it again? <br /><br />So there are some interesting questions brought up here for a solid socially critic drama (but then again, this movie is just not, because of focusing on \"cool\" production techniques and special effects an not giving the characters a moment to reflect and most of all forcing the story along the path where they want it to be and not paying attention to let the story breath and naturally evolve.) <br /><br />It wants to be a drama to not glorify abuse of substances and violence (would be political incorrect these days, wouldn't it?) but on the other hand it is nothing more then a cheap action movie (like there are so so many out there) with an average set of actors and a Vinnie Jones who is managing to not totally ruin what's left of his reputation by doing what he always does.<br /><br />So all in all i .. just ... can't recommend it.<br /><br />1 for Vinnie and 2 for the editing.",
    "From the beginning of the movie, it gives the feeling the director is trying to portray something, what I mean to say that instead of the story dictating the style in which the movie should be made, he has gone in the opposite way, he had a type of move that he wanted to make, and wrote a story to suite it. And he has failed in it very badly. I guess he was trying to make a stylish movie. Any way I think this movie is a total waste of time and effort. In the credit of the director, he knows the media that he is working with, what I am trying to say is I have seen worst movies than this. Here at least the director knows to maintain the continuity in the movie. And the actors also have given a decent performance.",
    "I basically skimmed through the movie but just enough to catch watch the plot was about. To tell you the truth it was kind of boring to me and at some spots it didn't make sense. The only reason I watched this movie in the first place was to see CHACE CRAWFORD!!! He is so hot, but in this movie his hair was kind of weird. But still hot.<br /><br />However, despite how hot CHACE is, it really did not make up for the film. I guess the plot isn't that bad but what really threw me over was the fact that they cuss in like every sentence. Is it that hard to express your anger without saying the F word every time?The cussing was annoying and the whole flashy, camera shaking thing gave me a headache.<br /><br />All in all, although the plot was OK, I found the film to be a bore and over dramatic. That's why I only cut to scenes with CHACE in it. LOL Anyways, not worth renting unless your a die-hard fan of a specific cast member like I was. Oh yeah the cast was Hot. The girls were HOT!!! But CHACE IS THE BEST!!",
    "This fanciful horror flick has Vincent Price playing a mad magician that realizes his vocational talents have been sold to another. He devise ways of avenging all those that have wronged him. His master scheme seems to back fire on him.<br /><br />Price is a little below par compared to his masterpieces, but is still the only reason to watch this thriller. Supporting cast includes Patrick O'Neal, Mary Murphy, Eva Gabor and Jay Novello.<br /><br />",
    "If I had not read Pat Barker's 'Union Street' before seeing this film, I would have liked it. Unfortuntately this is not the case. It is actually my kind of film, it is well made, and in no way do I want to say otherwise, but as an adaptation, it fails from every angle.<br /><br />The harrowing novel about the reality of living in a northern England working-class area grabbed hold of my heartstrings and refused to let go for weeks after I had finished. I was put through tears, repulsion, shock, anger, sympathy and misery when reading about the women of Union Street. Excellent. A novel that at times I felt I could not read any more of, but I novel I simply couldn't put down. Depressing yes, but utterly gripping.<br /><br />The film. Oh dear. Hollywood took Barker's truth and reality, and showered a layer of sweet icing sugar over the top of it. A beautiful film, an inspiring soundtrack, excellent performances, a tale of hope and romance...yes. An adaptation of 'Union Street'...no.<br /><br />The women of Union Street and their stories are condensed into Fonda's character, their stories are touched on, but many are discarded. I accept that some of Barker's tales are sensitive issues and are too horrific for mass viewing, and that a film with around 7 leading protagonists just isn't practical, but the content is not my main issue. The essence and the real gut of the novel is lost - darkness and rain, broken windows covered with cardboard, and the graphically described stench of poverty is replaced with sunshine, pretty houses, and a twinkling William's score.<br /><br />If you enjoyed the film for its positivity and hope in the face of 'reality', I advise that you hesitate to read the book without first preparing yourself for something more like 'Schindler's List'...but without the happy ending.",
    "I saw the capsule comment said \"great acting.\" In my opinion, these are two great actors giving horrible performances, and with zero chemistry with one another, for a great director in his all-time worst effort. Robert De Niro has to be the most ingenious and insightful illiterate of all time. Jane Fonda's performance uncomfortably drifts all over the map as she clearly has no handle on this character, mostly because the character is so poorly written. Molasses-like would be too swift an adjective for this film's excruciating pacing. Although the film's intent is to be an uplifting story of curing illiteracy, watching it is a true \"bummer.\" I give it 1 out of 10, truly one of the worst 20 movies for its budget level that I have ever seen.",
    "Robert DeNiro plays the most unbelievably intelligent illiterate of all time. This movie is so wasteful of talent, it is truly disgusting. The script is unbelievable. The dialog is unbelievable. Jane Fonda's character is a caricature of herself, and not a funny one. The movie moves at a snail's pace, is photographed in an ill-advised manner, and is insufferably preachy. It also plugs in every cliche in the book. Swoozie Kurtz is excellent in a supporting role, but so what?<br /><br />Equally annoying is this new IMDB rule of requiring ten lines for every review. When a movie is this worthless, it doesn't require ten lines of text to let other readers know that it is a waste of time and tape. Avoid this movie.",
    "Story of a man who has unnatural feelings for a pig. Starts out with a opening scene that is a terrific example of absurd comedy. A formal orchestra audience is turned into an insane, violent mob by the crazy chantings of it's singers. Unfortunately it stays absurd the WHOLE time with no general narrative eventually making it just too off putting. Even those from the era should be turned off. The cryptic dialogue would make Shakespeare seem easy to a third grader. On a technical level it's better than you might think with some good cinematography by future great Vilmos Zsigmond. Future stars Sally Kirkland and Frederic Forrest can be seen briefly.",
    "Ah, Bait. How do I hate thee? Let me count the ways. 1. You try to be funny, but are corny and unenjoyable; every joke is predictable and expected, and when it comes, does not inspire laughter. Instead, I want to hurl. 2. You try to be dramatic, but are unbelievable; the woman overacts to a terrible degree, and the \"bad guy\" looks like Bill Gates, and is about as scary as...well, Bill Gates. (Just try to imagine Bill Gates trying to intimidate somebody with a gun. Doesn't work, does it? A lawyer, maybe, but not a gun. Doesn't fit.) As for Jamie Foxx, well, just watching him try to deliver a dramatic and heartfelt dialogue is ludicrous, and makes me want to hurl. 3. You try to be action-packed, but instead are dull and dragging too many times. And when the action heats up, the tripod for the camera must have been lost, for the scenes wobble more than those in The Blair Witch Project, and I find myself nauseated, and once again I want to hurl. 4. You try to be a good movie, but you failed, you FAILED, YOU FAILED! I would rather walk barefoot across the Sahara with a pack full of beef jerky and no water, no sunscreen, and only Meryl Streep for company. This hell would be lovelier than a single minute more spent watching everyone in Bait overact their way through an idiotically written story with Bill Gates for a bad guy, and let's not even talk about the massive bomb that goes off in a car that Jamie Foxx's character has just driven OFF A CLIFF, but somehow manages to escape...just kill me now, or do the right thing and promise me that somehow I'll never have to watch a movie that is this bad, ever again.",
    "The premise of the movie has been explained and if you've gotten this far you don't me to pretend that I'm a movie critic. With that being said my own opinion of the movie is quite low. I'm a fan of Takashi Miike but this goes down in the category of his not so great work along with DOA 2 and 3, and some others (many).<br /><br />The movie seems to get a free pass because it is a Takashi film and nothing Takashi does can be wrong. This is a highschoolers approach to cinema. For the rest of us we'll find and hour and a half of a kid screaming for no real reason completely annoying (and yes, this does take away from the film), the pace of the film almost reaching levels of rigomortis, and the acting...well...hmmm. <br /><br />If one is a Takashi fan you'll see it regardless to peak your interests. It lacks any originality (see the Neverending Story) or any character development from the lead character in the face of conflict other then a quite superficial one. <br /><br />As it has been pointed out this is the first film Miike has been credited with co-writing, but that doesn't mean much as non of what we'd hope would be Miike's personality would spill over into the screen. All we get are some of the token Miike shots vis the director of photography.<br /><br />The movie had the potential to be something great. The premise is not a difficult one to run wild with. But this one seemed to have been run into the ground.<br /><br />My suggestion is if you're just getting into Miike is go with some of the standards like Gozu, Ichi, and Audition. Then movie into his works like Blue's Harp, Fudoh, Rainy Dog, Bird People of China.",
    "Uninspired direction leaves a decent cast stranded in a handsome but bland adaptation, in which dialogue seems recited rather than heartfelt, and cash strapped appearances by the ghosts fail to round up any sense of awe or magic; Edward Woodward, as the Ghost of Christmas Present, wobbles around on stilts and seems to be doing an impression of Bernard Cribbins. As Scrooge, George C. Scott is too wry, and he never seems to truly believe in it, which robs his performance of its effect. The scenes in which he's shown his past have as much impact as if he was half-heartedly flicking through his family album. No one else seems to be putting any effort in, except Frank Finlay, who chronically overacts.",
    "I was sooooo excited to see this movie after finally reading the book this week. My 13 year old son was looking forward to it too. I rented it and snuggled down to enjoy a classic holiday story brought to life on screen.<br /><br />Boy, was I disappointed. This movie veered off from the book more times than is forgivable. George C. Scott is an excellent actor but in this, it seemed that he was fully into character only about 20% of the time. The rest of the time he was quite flat.<br /><br />I realize that this was made in '84, pre-CG effects, for the most part. But it looked to be very B-movie quality, especially the encounter with Jacob Marley.<br /><br />The biggest disappointment was the fact that they left out one of the most moving parts of the story: When the Spirit of Christmas Present takes Scrooge on the whirlwind tour of the world, observing people in the bleakest of circumstances still having the light and love of Christmastime.<br /><br />I will admit that Mr. Scott did a good job with the \"reformed\" Scrooge at the end. That was a refreshing portrayal.<br /><br />I wish that Bob Cratchit had been portrayed as a little more ragged and down-trodden. And Tiny Tim... oh don't even get me started on bad child actors...",
    "Having seen three other versions of the same film, I am afraid for me this is by far the weakest, primarily due to Scott's rather dull and leaden performance. His emotions throughout are so bland it makes it difficult to engage in the film. Alistair Sim portrayed the role infinitely better. When Scrooge was at his meanest, you don't get the sense Scott is saying the dialogue with much conviction and when he undergoes his metamorphosis he is similarly unconvincing. I cannot think of any actors in this film who match those from the Alistair Sim version. Even the musical version (and frankly the Muppets) take on this are better executed. Very disappointing.",
    "Saw this movie in my English class this afternoon and was surprised by how bad this version was. Don't get me wrong, George C. Scott was terrific as Scrooge, but the rest of the cast fails so very badly. Sometimes I couldn't stop laughing at the stupid acting and the repeated line: \"Merry Christmas to everyone!\" Other times I almost fell asleep.<br /><br />The movie is based on a Charles Dickens short story about a rich guy, who don't think Christmas is nothing but humbug. After 30 minutes, the rich guy is visited by three ghosts, who persuade him to celebrate Christmas after all.<br /><br />I can not understand how this movie, with a script so bad it must have been written in five minutes, can be so well-rated. Instead of this piece of garbage, I recommend to you, the Bill Murray comedy Scrooged. That at least, was funny...",
    "When will the hurting stop? I never want to see another version of a Christmas Carol again. They keep on making movies with the same story, falling over each other in trying to make the movie better then the rest, but sadly fail to do so, as this is not a good story. Moralistic, old-fashioned, conservative happy-thinking. As if people learn. The numerous different versions of this film prove that we don´t.",
    "It was 9:30 PM last night at my friend's camping trailer and we were so hyped to watch South Park (a new episode). The thing is, in my country, South Park airs at 10:30 PM and we decided to kill time by watching the show now airing, Father of the Pride. I'll start by saying that I have only watched to episodes. The first time I watched it, I found it unfunny and crude for nothing, so I thought ''Holy sh*t, I have a football game early tomorrow, so I have to stop watching stupid cartoons''. But yesterday, I tried to give Father of the Pride a second chance. I find that it's a complete rip-off of The Simpsons, only replacing yellow human characters by lions instead.<br /><br />The second thing is I wonder why it got it's TV-14 rating. I find The Simpsons a lot more vulgar, and the only real vulgarity in this show is a few homosexual (unfunny) jokes. The Simpsons is also a lot more violent (Halloween specials) and crude. I also heard that the creator of the series has also directed Shrek 2, well I've got news for him: Shrek 2 was way better and I think he stayed too much in the family thematic. However, I must admit that Father of the Pride did make me smile (even burst out laughing once) three or four times.<br /><br />All in all, I don't mind Father of the Pride. I don't hate it, but I don't like either. I've seen way better from ''The Simpsons''.<br /><br />3.5/10",
    "This is blatantly a futuristic adaptation of Jules Verne's \"Mysterious Island\". The sound editing is pretty bad. You hear the dialogue on set and you hear the voices being recorded on a recording booth at the same time! This is an amateur film with actors from Boston and shot around New Hampshire. For those living in New Engalnd and who is reading this comment will be wowed with a capital W. This film is full of flaws. You get to hear the director's voice giving directions and giving out directions to the actress. \"OK now stand up.\" As for the other characters. There is this guy who talks with his mind instead of his voice and this blue alien. The alien guy talks with a deep voice. When he is yawning or grunting when he is fighting you hear the actor's voice. As for the special effects, man! This was Brett Piper's early work for crying out loud! The creatures are good but the animation is jerky. Really jerky. Sort of like Karl Zeman animation in JOURNEY TO BEGINNING OF TIME (1955). The special effects are imaginative. Thge music is good. Bottom line, this film makes EQUINOX or PLANET OF THE DINOSAURS look like a Ray Harryhausen epic. Did you know MYSTERIOUS PLANET was a home movie and was on a shoes string budget? A must watch for aspiring film makers.",
    "Beyond a shadow of a doubt Mysterious Planet is one of the worst movies ever made, yet retains an affection in my heart because the poverty of its special effects and astoundingly awful sound track in the first 15 minutes (and to be honest that's all you need to see) combine to create something that is hilariously side-splitting.<br /><br />The opening scene in 'space' is just about as unfathomable as cinematography gets, as washing-up liquid bottles whiz past your eyes to muffled dialogue. Before you've had time to work out whether it's you who's gone mad, the credits roll and the action struggles to life.<br /><br />And aside from the double-headed plasticine giant snail that terrorises our heroes, you also get the added double bonus of having both the original actors voices AND the dubbed voices at the same time. Pure genius.<br /><br />The sad thing for fans of this kind of fare is that I've only ever seen one copy, so the chances of ever seeing it yourself is highly unlikely. Perhaps I own the only copy in existence.<br /><br />",
    "The silent one-panel cartoon Henry comes to Fleischer Studios, billed as \"The world's funniest human\" in this dull little cartoon. Betty, long past her prime, thanks to the Production Code, is running a pet shop and leaves Henry in charge for far too long -- five minutes. A bore.",
    "William Russ is the main character throughout this made for TV movie. He left his family behind to only reappear and begin paying off his debts. But he tries to keep away from his family. Thats where Peter Falk (Colombo) comes in, playing several different roles, to convince him to come home.<br /><br />The story is average and they actually managed to get a former star (Peter Falk) and use him to a fairly nice degree. But William Russ wasn't truly a star. However, it appears his acting is still OK.<br /><br />I found the delivery and story very cheesy in how everything was predictable. In fact, the last 20 minutes I could almost dictate word for word before it happened. A good movie should never be like that.<br /><br />Overall, it was a sub-par movie. In a letter grading system, it would receive a \"D\".",
    "From a poorly contrived plot line that makes almost no sense to bad dialogue and disjointed scenes to the ultimate downer, bad acting (even Peter Falk can't find his way) \"Finding John Christmas\" is better left lost. Ms. Bertinelli's performance is without depth or emotion as are her co-stars, William Russ as brother Hank and David Cubitt as love interest Noah. Jennifer Pisana as Soccoro, the daughter of single dad Noah is almost unbearable to watch let alone listen to singing. But who can blame them with material like this. Michael J. Murray's script is juvenile at best. <br /><br />Each year at this time I search the TV guides and wait anxiously for some of the really classic Christmas and inspirational holiday films to appear on the small screen. Films like \"Miracle on 34th Street\", Ernst Lubitsch's delightful \"The shop around the corner\" and, of course the 1951 version of \"Scrooge\". There's Frank Capra's classics \"It's a wonderful life\" and \"Meet John Doe\". Hey, forget the classics. What about \"Home Alone\" or \" Home for the Holidays\" with Holly Hunter and a great performance by Robert Downey Jr.? <br /><br />My present to you is by way of advice. Your time would be better spent searching out these films than finding \"Finding John Christmas\". Merry Christmas!",
    "I never like to comment on a good film but when it comes to a bad movie, I gotta come really hard on it. Talking about Vivah, this guy, Sooraj Badjatya, seems to have completely lost it. After success of Hum Aapke Hain Kaun, he thought he can make money with cheesy wedding videos. Vivah is so so cheesy that Badjatyas have left Johars and Chopras behind.<br /><br />There was not a single moment during the movie where I can say 'Oh! at least this thing is good'. Aloknath does cliché in a role of Girl's father, Shahid kapoor looks fat and Shahrukhed, Amrita rao is another disaster in addition to ugly looking sets, bad costumes, hackneyed storyline, monstrous stepmother, trying-hard-to-act actors, cacophonous background music, cheap soundtracks.<br /><br />Now the spoiler, I'm warning you guys that as happens in all his other movies, after a calamitous incidence movie ends on a happy note.",
    "I won't say this movie was bad, but it wasn't good either. I expected something good but I guess Hum Aapke Hain Kaun was much better than this. This was completely old fashioned. At every stage of this movie, I hoped for some twist and what do I get? The girl gets burned and wins her aunt's love. <br /><br />Despite of being engaged, they have to take permission for every little move they make. They are so darn shy even after so many meetings. I expected the aunt to be much more brutal than that. All she did was crib madly. <br /><br />Hey, we have kids too, but we don't watch them and have tears in our eyes always. This movie is a dream. Happy family, one cruel woman, good in-laws and a man who loves her to death. In HAHK Anupam Kher was the poor bride's father and now it's vice versa. And I somehow knew that Mohnish Behl would be in this movie. Anyway I believe I wasted my time. I give it a 2/10.",

Wake up people!<br /><br />Four out of the five people that saw the film with me would not recommend the film. We had a great time bashing majority of the unrealistic scenes.

I was hugely disappointed. It is a script reading not a film, vulgar for the sake of being vulgar, bankrupt in every way that \"The Tailor of Panama\" is rich and satisfying. Blame it on the screen writing and directing. I sat in the theater waiting for the \"good part;\" it never came. I neither laughed nor cried, although one line of dialog did make me smile. Worth $7?

    "I very nearly walked out, but I'd paid my money, and my nearly-as-disgusted friend wanted to hold out. After the endearing, wide-eyed innocence of \"A New Hope\" and the thrilling sophistication of \"The Empire Strikes Back,\" I remember awaiting \"Return of the Jedi\" with almost aching anticipation. But from the opening scene of this insultingly commercial sewage, I was bitterly disappointed, and enraged at Lucas. He should have been ashamed of himself, but this abomination undeniably proves that he doesn't have subatomic particle of shame in his cold, greedy heart. Episode I would go on to reinforce this fact -- your honor, I call Jarjar Binks (but please issue barf bags to the members of the jury first).<br /><br />From the initial raising of the gate at Jabba's lair, this \"film\" was nothing more than a two-plus-hour commercial for as many licensable, profit-making action figures as Lucas could cram into it -- the pig-like guards, the hokey flesh-pigtailed flunky, that vile muppet-pet of Jabba's, the new and recycled cabaret figures, the monsters, etc., etc., ad vomitum. Then there were the detestably cute and marketable Ewoks. Pile on top of that all of the rebel alliance aliens. Fifteen seconds each on-screen (or less) and the kiddies just GOTTA have one for their collection. The blatant, exploitative financial baiting of children is nauseating.<br /><br />Lucas didn't even bother to come up with a new plot -- he just exhumed the Death Star from \"A New Hope\" and heaved in a boatload of cheap sentiment. What an appalling slap in the face to his fans. I can't shake the notion that Lucas took a perverse pleasure in inflicting this dreck on his fans: \"I've got these lemmings hooked so bad that I can crank out the worst piece of stinking, putrid garbage that I could dream up, and they'll flock to the theaters to scarf it up. Plus, all the kiddies will whine and torture their parents until they buy the brats a complete collection of action figures of every single incidental undeveloped, cartoonish caricature that I stuffed in, and I get a cut from every single one. It'll make me even more obscenely rich.\"<br /><br />There may have been a paltry, partial handful of redeeming moments in this miserable rip-off. I seem to recall that Harrison Ford managed to just barely keep his nose above the surface of this cesspool. But whatever tiny few bright spots there may be are massively obliterated by the offensive commercialism that Lucas so avariciously embraced in this total, absolute sell-out to profit.",
    "The fine cast cannot uplift this routine tale of a secretary murdered by her married paramour. In fact there are more questions than answers in this one-sided tale of romance and murder; and since we are only provided with the prosecution's side, none of these questions will be answered. This is the type of fare that appeals to the \"He Woman, Man Hater\" clubs of America. As presented, it is the tale of an innocent woman who just happens to be \"caught up\" in a romance with a married, high-profile attorney. Is it possible that IF, she had not been two timing her boy friend and having an affair with a married man, the whole nasty murderous, sordid incident could have been avoided? When you watch this, don't worry about going to the 'fridge, you won't miss anything.",
    "This film was choppy, incoherent and contrived. It was also an extremely mean-spirited portrayal of women. I rented it because it was listed as a comedy (that's a stretch), and because the cover said Andie McDowell was acting up a storm in it. She wasn't. I'm a gal, I watched this film with two guys, and we spent an hour afterwards exclaiming over how bad it was.<br /><br />WARNING: PLOT SUMMARY BELOW! RAMPANT SPOILERS!<br /><br />The movie starts out with a fairly hackneyed plot about an older woman who takes up with a younger man, to the severe disapproval of her two jealous single girlfriends. They want her to marry a boring guy their own age who is kind of in love with her. But she's so happy with her oversexed puppy that you're rooting for them to stick it out, and sure enough, she decides to marry the guy. But her harpy girlfriend, aided by the wishy-washy one, sets up a plot to trick our heroine into thinking the guy is cheating on her. It works. She has a fight with him, he runs out of the house and is crushed by a truck (Remember the movie's title?) So now he's dead, two-thirds of the way through the film. And although our heroine is a school headmistress who spends her time watching over girls, she apparently forgot to use birth control and is pregnant.<br /><br />She's already broken off relations with her girlfriends, because they were so unsupportive. Alone and pitiful, she decides to marry the boring guy. Did I mention that the boring guy who kind of loves her is a minister? She had asked him to marry her to the young guy (nice, huh?), but now she tells him she'll marry him, and apparently he has no objections to being dicked around in this fashion. But her girlfriends rescue her at the altar and take her home, where they not-quite-confess that they were mostly responsible for the love of her life getting smushed. She has the kid. In the final scene, they leave it in a crib inside her house while they go out on the porch to drink, smoke and be smug. I kid you not, it's that bad. I left out the part about the cancer red-herring and the harpy's ridiculous lesbian moment.",
    "This film is a calculated attempt to cash in the success of Sex in the City and Four Weddings and a Funeral. In fact, if they'd called it Sex at a Funeral, they might have done better at the box office.<br /><br />But the film falls between two stools and can't get up. The characters spout improbably bright dialog, but never act in any way remotely recognizable as human. One arbitrary, senseless action follows another to advance what passes for a plot, and one soon tires of the falsity of the whole enterprise.<br /><br />Andie MacDowell gets points for acting her little heart out, but the performing honors are stolen by Imelda Staunton, as of all things, a police detective (don't they have a height requirement over there?). Ms. Staunton seems unable to make a false move. Would that we could say the same about the writer-director.<br /><br />If Notting Hill annoyed you as being bogus, stay away from this one. Phonus bolognus on the half-shell.",
    "This had to be one of the worst films ever. When Kate shows up and Jed is with a bunch of guys and they all start clapping...so Hollywood. Another bad scene was when Kate was running her hands over the pavement it appeared that she was examining the texture of the pavement. Andie's acting is so bad in this film - I could not connect with them or feel there love for each other. The other 2 women however were very good and overshadowed Andie. Anyway this was such a campy movie. I usually like these type of films but I just couldn't get into this film. Too many unlikely situations and again Andie's acting didn't help the film. Also, she is all gums. Lancome must put her makeup on with a putty knife because she looks glamorous in the commericals.",
    "This starts off bad, what with the three women acting like simpering junior high school wussies sitting around giggling with their gin, endless cigarettes and a caramel chocolate treat for the one who tells the best 'man' story, and then it gets worse -=- spoiler alert =-= what with Andie's character falling for the young organ player who used to be her student when he was 14 (she's the headmistress of an English school, believe it or not), only to have him destroyed thanks to her bitch-from-hell 'girlfriend' . ..and then from there, it's basically unwatchable claptrap: she forgives her 'friend' and has the organ player's love child and the 3 women end up as they started, drinking more gin and smoking more cigarettes blah blah blah. Andie's character throws the caramel chocolates out in the street, in a pathetic attempt to symbolize growth. Have mercy.",
    "This was awful. Andie Macdowell is a terrible actress. So wooden she makes a rocking horse look like it could do a better job. But then remember that turn in Four Weddings, equally as excruciating. Another film that portrays England as full of Chocolate box cottages, and village greens. I mean that school, how many schools apart from maybe Hogwarts look like that? The twee police station looked like the set from Heartbeat ( a nauseating British series set in the 60s).This film just couldn't make its mind up what it wanted to be- a comedy or a serious examination of the undercurrents in women's friendships. If it had stuck to the former then the graveyard sex scenes and the highly stupid storming of the wedding might just have worked( i say just). But those scenes just didn't work with the tragedy in the second half. I also find it implausible that Kate would ever speak to Molly again after her terrible behaviour. A final note- what is a decent actress like Staunton doing in this pile of poo? Not to mention Anna Chancellor. Macdowell should stick to advertising wrinkle cream.",
    "Caught this on IFC yesterday, and can't believe the positive reviews! Am I the only one who thought these \"ladies\" were anything but? Kate tells Jed she could get fired because she's supposed to be a pillar of the community, but puts out for him! Then they suddenly decide they're in love? And she's SO devastated over his death, she doesn't go to his funeral, much less, tell his family the \"good news\"! By the way, how did an American get to be the headmistress of a very proper British school? Janine should have been kicked off the force for her inexcusable abuse of power, but nothing happens! And she winds up boffing a con she brought in for questioning! And the less said about Molly, the better!<br /><br />As for the guilt Janine and Molly feel over Jed, please! It's the punk's own damn fault he got turned into roadkill! Where's the guilt over poor Gerald, who gets puked on? If only I could do the same to the bozos behind this \"movie\"!",
    "I thought it was a New-York located movie: wrong! It's a little British countryside setting.<br /><br />I thought it was a comedy: wrong! It's a drama.... Well, up to the last third, because after the story becomes totally \"abracadabrantesque\", the symbolic word for a French presidential mandate. It means, close to nonsense even it the motives would like to bring a sincere feeling.<br /><br />What Do I have left? Maybe, a good duo of actress: Yes, I know, they are 3 friends, but the redhead policewoman is a bit invisible for me. The tall doctoress surprises by her punch, and McDowell delivers a fine acting as usual, all in delicate, soft and almost mute attitude. This gentleness puzzles me, because as other fine artists or directors, the same pattern is repeating over and over. In her case, it's like, whatever the movie, it's always the same character defined by her feelings, her values, who lives infinite different stories. I still don't know how to set the limit (or the fusion) between the artists and the works.<br /><br />Another positive side of this movie is its feminine touch & the interesting different points of view. The women have each their own way of living, even if they are all single. It brings a lot of tolerance and learning to witness how a same and unique reality can be perceived in as many ways as people.<br /><br />Finally, the movie is quite viewable, but the great final cuts the desire of a next vision.",
    "Was this meant to be a comedy or a serious drama? This film starts with a light-hearted banter between three women. Fine. It moves into a conflict between the women when one of them meets a man. Fine. There are a few antics between them. Fine. But when the plot thickens and finally becomes black I started to wonder whether I had misinterpreted the first part of the movie. It continues in this vein for a while until, in the end, it tries to go back to the original light-hearted banter. But by now it's too late. It's hard to see why these women would still be talking to one another and the finale is unconvincing. Truly a lesson (for British filmmakers anyway) of how not to make films. Difficult to see how the producers ever convinced themselves this film would work. And the box office proved it to be a real flop, because I'd never heard of this film until this weekend (four years after its release).",

Far fetched no longer covers it. Without these unbelievable scenes, there may have been hope for a sweet love story. Instead, all the viewer is left with is an involuntary shaking of head -- these things just don't happen! Without giving away cliff-hanger details, I warn the viewer of having high expectations for this film; most (like me) will be very disappointed. On a scale of 1 to 10, this one ranks a weak 4 with me. There is much better material out there. This one isn't worth your time.",

    "The worst thing about Crush is not that it's acted pretty bad, or that the plot is virtually non-existent, and it's not even that bad that the camerawork could have been better.<br /><br />No, the worst part of this movie is that it has a few absolutely brilliant moments that keep you hoping that there are more to come.<br /><br />But in the end, it's too little, too late. If you are a fan of violin-music and cheap tearjerking scenes of 40+ women crying and hugging and talking about babies and marriage - then by all means, don't miss it.<br /><br />I myself am not exactly thrilled to see the things listed above in a movie, and as a result I had a pretty horrible time. The few absolutely brilliant jokes can not make up for the rest of it.<br /><br />The verdict: 4/10. Guilty of wasting my time.<br /><br />",
    "Not a `woman film' but film for the gang. One of the worst films ever made by a male director about woman. Director Andy McKay simply doesn't know woman.

I wonder how three good actresses accepted to take part in it.",
    "As a single woman over 40, I found this film extremely insulting and demeaning to single women over 40, not to mention every other woman, of any age. It was a sad, pathetic attempt by a man to write and direct a \"chick flick\", and it failed miserably. Andy McDowell isn't much of an actress to begin with, but given the non-existent \"plot\" (I hate to even refer to it as a plot) in this, she didn't have a chance. There was no character development, no reason to feel sympathy/empathy for any of the characters, and no attempt to make the film in any way realistic or believable. And then there's the obligatory male-fantasy of an attractive straight woman suddenly deciding to give lesbianism a try -- PLEASE.<br /><br />Not only do I wish I could get my money back for the DVD rental, I also want those 112 minutes of my life back. What a ripoff.",
    "I was gifted with this movie as it had such a great premise, the friendship of three women bespoiled by one falling in love with a younger man.<br /><br />Intriguing.<br /><br />NOT! I hasten to add. These women are all drawn in extreme caricature, not very supportive of one another and conspiring and contriving to bring each other down.<br /><br />Anna Chancellor and Imelda Staunton could do no wrong in my book prior to seeing this, but here they are handed a dismal script and told to balance the action between slapstick and screwball, which doesn't work too well when the women are all well known professionals in a very small town.<br /><br />And for intelligent women they spend a whole pile of time bemoaning the lack of men/sex/lust in their lives. I felt much more could have been made of it given a decent script and more tension, the lesbian sub-plot went nowhere and those smoking/drinking women (all 3 in their forties???) were very unrealistic - even in the baby scene - screw the baby, gimme a cigarette! Right.<br /><br />Like I said, a shame of a waste. 4 out of 10.",
    "\"The Crush\" is a pleasant enough 40-something friends romantic chick flick for the first two-thirds or so, as it tries to be a Brit \"Sex and the City\". <br /><br />I particularly enjoyed the turn-around of the trophy young hunk whose character is not much fleshed out (come to think of it we didn't see all that much physical flesh of him either and Kenny Doughty is worth seeing more of). <br /><br />They sure make a lot more deal of young man/older woman than was made of the opposite in either version of \"Sabrina\" (neither movie do I like) or for that matter with the Douglas/Zeta-Jones or Dion/Svengali nuptials.<br /><br />Surrounding Andie MacDowell as an ex pat otherwise are welcome familiars from Brit dramas and comedies, such as tart-tongued Anna Chancellor. <br /><br />The plot twists towards the end feel very deus ex machina. But it wasn't until the credits came up at the end that I realized what might really be wrong. Just as with \"Sex and the City,\" the writer/director is male, here first-timer Scot John McKay, and I think he really wanted to do a script about three gay men, probably about them coming out in relation to their lovers and at work (the characters are a school principal, a cop and a doctor), which would have been a better and more interesting movie. The working title for the film was \"The Sad F*cker's Club\" which would have made its parallels with the gay \"Broken Hearts Club\" even more obvious.<br /><br />(originally written 4/6/2002)",
    "it MIGHT have been a good movie if it had explored something more interesting rather than just the surface of a lesbian relationship if this was the meaning of the movie...it is quite predictable not mentioning that the two girls resemble the Russian group t.A.T.u....coincidence? i don't think so. There is nothing original in this movie to support it so they had to use something which is already famous.You know the recipe. The other actors...well,i just don't know what their role is supposed to be. Most of them are well - known people in Romania and i must mention some of them are not even actors(e.g.Mihaela Radulescu).SO to summarize it: \"girl band tatty\"+desperate/publicity needing \"actors\"+ a non-existing plot+ the occasion to use bad language in order to shock= Love sick....too bad...the idea was good,though...and i am seriously holding myself from commenting the title...",
    "***LIGHT SPOILER ALERT*** The story sounds good and if you've read the novel, then you're probably expecting a deep and intense movie that could offer some insight for some interesting and insufficiently explored human relationships.<br /><br />True enough, the script tries to do that, the director tries to do that, but the main cast fails miserably. Maria's acting is so dry that lacks any feeling whatsoever, her most intense moments seem almost comical. Sometimes she seems to be nervous due to the camera. Her only really feeling scene is near the end where she gets dumped by her girlfriend.<br /><br />Ioana seems even more tense than Maria and even worse, she doesn't seem natural at all. Maria had the attitude, even if it was artificially pushed towards being obvious, but she had it and her character received some credibility. And to make matters worse, we don't have an insight on her: where does she come from, how come she got involved in the lesbian relationship, how did the relationship evolve? We only get some bits from her parents and their relationship just seems to 'be' there: it has a content and and end, but no beginning. Just like her partner Maria, she has only once scene that is truly touching, the scene where she dumps Maria's character Kiki.<br /><br />Tudor is the only person in this movie (aside from the landlady, great acting there) who manages to prove some acting talent. He has his character's attitude and it fits him. Only once or twice he seems to falter (the scene at his parents' meal, he tries to be obvious when it wasn't necessary at all).<br /><br />I love the story, Tudor Chirila is OK there, the landlady actually acts and Puya delivers his couple of lines with style, but this doesn't save the movie. Too bad, the entire setting had huge potential and the Romanian cinematography could've used a movie on this theme.<br /><br />Oddly enough, the incestuous relationship between brother and sister seems to have more credibility than the no-background no-feeling (well, Maria's spoken interludes are a nice try in this direction) lesbian relationship of Maria and Ioana. I'm quite sorry for spending money on a ticket, I'd rather had watched it from the comfort of my room.",
    "This is a movie that relies solely on the somewhat controversial image of incest and lesbianism to get noticed.That is it.The dialogs are pathetic and the sensuality of the \"sex scenes\" is absolutely absent.The acting and the dialog are more suited for high-school children,yet the subject is intended for adult audiences. It is a gutless and shallow movie.It could have been way better if it had a story and more drama. Ah and on top of that, one more thing: why are inner monologues so excessively used? Makes it seem so cheap.All in all an embarrassing movie for Romanian cinema as well as for mature audiences attempting to view it.I know the means are scarce but, that is not always an excuse for a movie flopping as this one does.And please start using some good actors in your movies and stop recycling them from musicians (Tudor Chirila) - they can't act!",

    "Considering that this movie had a serious and quite successful launching campaign, I would have expected something to be worth the fuzz...from the opening scene on (in which the two brothers \"sensually\" caress each other, laying naked in a bed) it goes rapidly downwards...nothing to get the attention, not a mind-catching thing in the whole plot, baaad baad acting (a few minor exceptions, but artificiality is at its best). Incest and lesbianism are promising themes, but the script analyses none of the two in depth ( mind that a possible excuse of the makers, saying that they aimed for a subtle movie would be hilarious, unless subtle and superficial mean the same thing...). The too curious viewers will not get any interesting scene...at this point, that could have saved some of the movie...so you can imagine how bad it is. Many other things could be said...but please watch the movie yourselves...I am an egoist and I would like as many people as possible to waste about 1 1/2h of their lives...like I did :(",
    "Yes, indeed, it could have been a good movie. A love biangle, (sorry for the poetical license, but is not a triangle!) an interesting story, unfortunately badly told. The image is sometimes weird, sometimes OK, the picture looks crowded and narrow-sighted. The sound needs more attention (it usually does in Romanian movies), the light and color filters are sometimes badly chosen. The soundtrack is short and is not helping the action. About the acting... sorry but the best actress is the landlady. The others are acting immaturely and cannot convince the viewer. The acting is poetical when it should be realistic, and realistic when it should be poetical. It's a picture for adults, told by the children. Bother only if extremely curious.",
    "Closer to reality and containing more depth than \"Breakdance\", Stan Lathan's \"Beat Street\" is still a pretty dull show. Again this pic is really only cashing in on the 'breakin' craze but at least we get a little bit of entertainment from the plot, which concerns the lives of three young friends and a younger brother, all growing up in Queens, New York. Each has their own unique talent. One is a hustler, one a d.j., another an artist who creates 'burners', while little bro' Lee is a hot 'hip hop' dancer.<br /><br />Lathan is unable to generate any real audience interest in the story though, and his young cast are likewise struggling with their characters. Therefore it is left almost entirely to the funky music and the 'fresh' dancing to save the day.<br /><br />Choreography is again sharp for both club and street scenes, but this alone is not enough to lift \"\"Beat Street\" to greater heights. Unfortunately the film really falls flat late on, after showing a glimmer of hope that it just might get interesting.<br /><br />Sunday, August 25, 1996 - Video",
    "Hilariously obvious \"drama\" about a bunch of high school (I think) kids who enjoy non-stop hip-hop, break dancing, graffiti and trying to become a dj at the Roxy--or something. To be totally honest I was so bored I forgot! Even people who love the music agree this movie is terribly acted and--as a drama--failed dismally. We're supposed to find this kids likable and nice. I found them bland and boring. The one that I REALLY hated was Ramon. He does graffiti on subway trains and this is looked upon as great. Excuse me? He's defacing public property that isn't his to begin with. Also these \"great\" kids tap into the city's electricity so they can hold a big dance party at an abandoned building. Uh huh. So we're supposed to find a bunch of law breakers lovable and fun.<br /><br />I could forgive all that if the music was good but I can't stand hip hop. The songs were--at best--mediocre and they were nonstop! They're ALWAYS playing! It got to the point that I was fast-forwarding through the many endless music numbers. (Cut out the music and you haver a 30 minute movie--maybe) There are a few imaginative numbers--the subway dance fight, a truly funny Santa number and the climatic Roxy show. If you love hip hop here's your movie. But it you're looking for good drama mixed in--forget it. Also HOW did this get a PG rating? There's an incredible amount of swearing in this.",
    "Maybe you shouldn't compare, but Wild Style and Style Wars are original Hip Hop. Beat Street does have a lot of the original artists of early Hip Hop, but they've been obviously made clear that this could be their big break, of course for some it was and that's nice. But if you view this as original Hip Hop Culture you're wrong. It's overproduced and has a Hollywood sauce. Rather look for the first two movies i mentioned. They have convey the grittiness that comes with life in the ghetto. Yes, the rating for this movie is low, but the reviews are mostly positive or even raving. This is probably because although the story, the acting, the dialogues and the direction all are dreadful, the music and dancing is what the people love about it. Me, i do love the dancing but at the time thought that electro was the death of Hip Hop (i was so glad when round '86 a new generation of now classic Hip Hop artists appeared, like Krs One, Public Enemy, Ultramagnetic Mc's, Jungle Brothers, Bizmarkie to name a few), and i still don't like most of the beats in this movie and that is why it doesn't work for me. I mean, Wild Style has not much of a story but the music there is great and authentic. Of course tastes differ and that's alright. But as far as i'm concerned, this movie is trash except for the break dancing and some of the music and so i can't rate it higher than a 4 out of ten.",
    "I could never stand watching Happy Days after Chachi joined the cast, so I knew I was in trouble when the best scene in this movie featured Scott Baio (a skateboard chase scene!). Jodie Foster in her first \"grown-up\" role turns in her usual professional performance but that is no excuse for this boring mess. Two hours out of my life that I'll never get back! No noteworthy characters, unbelievable storyline, questionable editing and horrendous cinematography but worst of all, I couldn't have cared less. The story of California teens in the 1970's, where the kids live miserable lives and all their parents are idiots. Don't waste your time watching this ugly excuse for a movie.",
    "Horrible film with bits of the Ramones strewn about. Your worse than average 1970's/80's comedy format of the cool kids taking over the school with some whimsical plan. This movie is terrible. The plot consists of a girl who enjoys the Ramones and a school bent on fighting against their oppressive administration. Forget this movie and watch something like Wild Zero starring Guitar Wolf if you want an entertaining B movie. Terrible acting, terrible writing, terrible plot with the stamp of approval of the Ramones who probably needed some money quick so they said yes to this movie. That is the only logical thing I can think of because this movie blows.",
    "This movie is a 90 minute Ramones concert with brief periods of stupidity and absolute boredom. What kind of high school is this anyway?<br /><br />Unless you are a major Ramones fan, DO NOT and I repeat DO NOT waste your time like I did. This is utterly unwatchable from start to finish. This movie should be called Ramone Fever. Everyone appears to like them in this movie. There is not a plot to be found in this flick. As far as teen comedies go, you are scraping the bottom of the barrel with this one.",
    "I gave this film 2 stars only because Dominic Monaghan actually put effort through in his acting. Everything else about this film is extremely amateur. Everything associated with the direction of this film was very poorly executed. Not only should the director rethink what she is doing for a life career but maybe she should watch a few films. As Dominic Monaghan is a very credible actor, placing him in a film of this caliber makes him look awful. Whomever the \"actor\" was that played Jack's best friend should never have stepped in front of the camera. I didn't expect much from such a small film, but perhaps a little more time and effort should be put into the characters and their surroundings. Don't waste your time or money on this film (like I did) you will be sorely disappointed.",
    "I jumped at the chance to view this movie uncut and uninterrupted, remembering rahs and raves for it. But wherever it seemed about to slip into being truly scary, it backed off and went somewhere else. The dripping water throughout the house, the black rain, the prophetic dreams, taking the wrong turn in raw sewage were dropped before they could work up to a scream.<br /><br />What a disappointment. Chamberlain's nearly expressionless mask of a face offered little but confused disbelief, something I found myself mirroring as the film wore on. What could have been eerie Aboriginal chanting and instruments in the background were instead a cacophony seemingly designed to beat terror into one's head. The ideas that modern people can embody ancient gods, that the Aboriginal peoples believe red-haired white men were the first priests, and many other possibilities are passed along more like a shopping list than a hint at another dimension (the Dream Time).<br /><br />[SPOILER] In the final scene, it wasn't clear to me what the director was trying to tell. Is there a big wave? So what? How big? A tsunami? Yeah, okay. That's devastating but not apocalyptic. Is it the end of the world? From a wave? The last wave? That'd have to be a pretty darn big wave. Why? Was the world that bad a place? It didn't seem so awful in this movie. Actually I didn't think the wave came off, since the shadow left Burton's face that had been cast by the wave. Was it only Burton's apocalypse? Heck, that happens every day to people who lose it. It wasn't of any interest if it was only him.<br /><br />The most frightening scene, and the one that gives the best indication of Weir's potential, was in Charlie's apartment where Burton has gone to confront the old man for scaring Burton's wife. Charlie keeps asking him \"Who are you?\" and it becomes truly disturbing after a while. Unfortunately, the movie never followed suit.",
    "The perfect murder is foiled when a wife(played by Mary Ellen Trainor, once the wife to director Robert Zemeckis, who helmed this episode), who murders her husband with a poker, has the misfortune of receiving a visitor as she is about to move the body outside..an escaped insane madman dressed in a Santa Claus suit(played by a deviously hideous Larry Drake). She fends for her life while trying to find a way of hiding her husband's corpse. She decides to use an ax, once she downs the Santa killer who misses several chances to chop off the woman's head, to frame the killer for her husband's murder. Santa killer locks her in a closet and pursues the woman's daughter as she tries desperate to free herself to save the child.<br /><br />This episode of TALES FROM THE CRYPT just recycles tired material involving the old \"Santa kills\" theme while also adding the oft-used(add nauseum)woman-murders-her-husband-for-a-man-she's-been-cheating-with routine. It's essentially Trainor trying to find a way to avoid being caught with a dead body she kills while also keeping a safe distance from a maniac. There's nothing refreshing or new about this plot which pretty much goes through the motions. Not one of the show's highlights.",
    "That's not the sound of bees, that's the effect induced by watching this extremely long, extremely boring, badly acted movie. How I ever made it through all 3 1/2 hours without falling asleep I'll never know. The plot is simple...3 thoroughly unlikable morons talk about sex for 3 1/2 hours. And you thought Rohmer was deadly. This is even worse, if that's possible. > I must really be a masochist if I could watch this entire movie without turning it off...or killing someone.",
    "Iberia is nice to see on TV. But why see this in silver screen? Lot of dance and music. If you like classical music or modern dance this could be your date movie. But otherwise one and half hour is just too long time. If you like to see skillful dancing in silver screen it's better to see Bollywood movie. They know how to combine breath taking dancing to long movie. Director Carlos Saura knows how to shoot dancing from old experience. And time to time it's look really good. but when the movie is one and hour it should be at least most of time interesting. There are many kind of art not everything is bigger then life and this film is not too big.",
    "That reviewers liked this movie surprises me. The plot is a muddle. The characters are wooden. Michael Bowen spends most of the film spying on the other characters and misjudging all of them. No one has any redeeming quality or point-of-interest. This is not an edgy work. It is not imaginative. It is not ironic. It is no clever. There is nothing straight forward about this tedious work. That is missed theatrical release is not surprise. That the \"This Network\" airs it diminishes that venue. I definitely recommend turning to a rerun of the Garden Smart show on PBS or even a good informational if you encountered this mess on late night television. If you encounter it on daytime television, take a long walk. Even if you walk in smog, you will feel better not having suffered through this shambles. Life is short. This movie is long.",
    "This is a terrible movie, terrible script, bad direction and nonsensical ending. Also, bad performances, except from Clancy Brown who is criminally underused here, and Michael Pollard. Watching this movie was purgatory--you do it to unload enough bad movie karma to actually see a good one further down the line.<br /><br />The movie presents a father and son who look like they couldn't every possibly have been related. The part of the male lead is not well written and seems uncharismatic in this role. You can see the plot points a mile away. The actions of the female lead and that of her brother, the cop, also make no sense. So, a major action on her part at the end of the movie makes no sense script-wise.",
    "Burt Kennedy used to be a very good director, but you'd never know it by this lumbering mess. Not only does this film look cheap, it IS cheap--most of the battle scenes are lifted from the far superior \"The Last Command\" from 1955, and that footage, shot 32 years previously, looks more contemporary than anything in this picture. The few action scenes that were actually shot for this movie are disorganized, confused and incompetent, looking just as shoddy as the rest of the picture. This has the look and feel of a bad student film (and the budget didn't seem to be a whole lot more). It moves like molasses, the acting for the most part is either over-the-top ham or under-the-top comatose--although Raul Julia comes off better than most of the rest of the cast--and it's chock full of annoying historical inaccuracies. On top of that, it's WAY too long. If you're going to make a boring film, do it in an hour or so and get it over with--don't stretch it out over three hours, like this one does. If you want to see a good movie about the Alamo, check out John Wayne's 1960 version, or even the 1955 film from which this movie stole its action scenes. Hard to believe it took six producers to make a movie this lousy. Skip it.",
    "While being a great James Arness western, this film has gone down as the worst Alamo film ever made. The story was terrible, inaccuracy all through it, and just downright untruths to boot! Continuity was cast to the four winds. Anybody catch the cannon sequence? The Mexicans were dumb enough to fire cannons that obviously had mud and ramrods still sticking out of the tubes. Come on! Then there is Brian Keith's ridiculous hat! Costumer must of been away or something. Or just out of their mind!",
    "This movie is flawed on many fronts. Like many before it, it portrays more of the mythology of the Alamo than the history. The production is poor, overall giving the impression of a welfare project for lots of actors who might have otherwise had to work on Hollywood Squares. This to me was the greatest flaw - I know the ages and general personalities of the real Alamo protagonists and the geriatric ensemble of TV actors chosen to portray them never let any hint of believability intrude.<br /><br />As a native Texan, I grew up with the mythology. I later learned more about the history. I can accept a decent production from either perspective (although I prefer more historical accuracy), but this never gave me a chance to enjoy it. Even John Wayne's or Fess Parker's versions had more life than this stolid mess, while being only slightly less accurate.<br /><br />Very disappointing - avoid it.",
    "Slow and riddled with inaccuracy. Over-looking its flaws this is still an interesting account of the famed and heroic siege of the Alamo during the Texas fight for independence from Mexico. James Arness as Jim Bowie. Brian Keith as Davy Crockett. Alec Baldwin as Col. Travis. Raul Julia as General Santa Anna. This made-for-TV project also stars David Ogden Stiers, Kathleen York and Jim Metzler. Very good original music by Peter Bernstein.",
    "This film, The Alamo:Thirteen Days to Glory, is utter rubbish. The acting is awful, it is far too patriotic and its historical accuracy is not always at its best (Historians would have a field day). It does have a few good moments but not enough to keep interest because it is far too long. Rating * out of **********.",
    "The story by Norman Maclean is a masterwork; Redford's film is a mediocrity. He adds banal scenes of the Maclean brothers going over a falls and of them double-dating in a seedy bar that were not even hinted at in the story. The cipher, Brad Pitt, trying to play the charismatic Paul Maclean, a genius outdoors, proves either risible or depressing, depending on what the original story meant to you. Some of the fly casting scenes are beautiful. Also, Tom Skerritt as the father and Craig Sheffer as Norman are strong and masculine, as men were once expected to be. None of the women make an impression in the film, which is regrettable, because Maclean loved the women in his story and made this clear, even poetic.",
    "The only good part about this film is the beautiful scenery. This movie was long and boring. The minister should have retired from the pulpit the time his son Paul strayed from the teachings he proclaimed. How many times can his boys take the Lord's name in vain in this film being from a Presbyterian background? It doesn't fit. I wished Paul was swept down the river without a boat at the very beginning to spare us the silly, smirkish, selfish story of Paul (Brad Pitt). So Norm becomes a teacher and Paul becomes a compulsive gambler who Norm wants to rescue but doesn't-so what. It's very uninteresting. We see the prejudiced whites being stood up to by Paul because of his native American girl. That was the only part that had some interest and maybe could have been developed into a real 'wild western'. What we only see is a sleepy town where the two minister's sons have nothing to do but 1. Norm chase a lame girlfriend and deal with her family and 2.Paul make up dumb stories at the newspaper shop while scratching his head and take a lot of swigs and tie a lot of flies. I'd rather watch a show about fishing that that film again-which will be never.",
    "... to not live in Montana and especially not to live there at the end of the 19th century.<br /><br />\"A river runs through it\" certainly is a well made movie from a cineastic stand-point. Great landscapes, Redford acting well.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the story is bad (if there is a story at all).<br /><br />I felt sorry for the narrator / author, who is as dry, narrow-minded a character as his father, a preacher. Being driven, not driving his own life, he is left to watch his brother, who is also caged in the small town environment, losing his life. The author never even comes close to undestand his brother's motivations, but at least realizes, that he is lacking the slightest amount of homour / fun. All there is, is fly-fishing, where he follows even as an old man the style of his father.<br /><br />The end is not surprising, it is forseeable from the very beginning.<br /><br />Definitely NOT a must-see (3 / 10)<br /><br />",
    "I always felt that a good film should have a plot. This particular film was missing one, and I feel that it would have been more effective with a plot. This was made even worse by the fact that it seemed to go on forever; I was anxious for it to finally end. However, I just noticed that it was only 123 minutes long; it felt like four hours. Not only was there no plot but the film also lacked a notable conflict. It's not the worst movie I've seen, but I used to say that it was until I saw \"The Fast And The Furious\". So, don't think this review of mine is from someone who needs nothing but action. I actually hate most action films out today; it's just that this film is all the way on the other side of the spectrum. Not much really happens in this movie. However, the scenery and costumes were nice.",

    "Mann photographs the Alberta Rocky Mountains in a superb fashion, and Jimmy Stewart and Walter Brennan give enjoyable performances as they always seem to do. <br /><br />But come on Hollywood - a Mountie telling the people of Dawson City, Yukon to elect themselves a marshal (yes a marshal!) and to enforce the law themselves, then gunfighters battling it out on the streets for control of the town? <br /><br />Nothing even remotely resembling that happened on the Canadian side of the border during the Klondike gold rush. Mr. Mann and company appear to have mistaken Dawson City for Deadwood, the Canadian North for the American Wild West.<br /><br />Canadian viewers be prepared for a Reefer Madness type of enjoyable howl with this ludicrous plot, or, to shake your head in disgust.",
    "This is an action Western. James Steart leads an all star cast in the scenic Northwest, which is filmed in great splendor. The scenery and costumes are great. There is action and adventure. Stewart plays a wealthy cattleman who runs afoul of a crooked government in the old Nothwest.<br /><br />The main drawback is the stereotypical cynic that Hollywood has always made into a hero. Even when this movie was made, the cynic was the stereotypical hero, and the one Stewart portrays really has few saving graces. He is kind to his two partners, and that does give him an extra dimension of credibility and likability.<br /><br />However, he is so piggish to everyone else, it is hard to really care for him, or to accept him. He is much like the one dimensional spaghetti Western characters (cut not that bad).<br /><br />Still, the minor characters are quite enjoyable. Walter Brennan, Royal Dano, Harry Morgan, and others make this worth watching.",
    "This is the worst sequel on the face of the world of movies. Once again it doesn't make since. The killer still kills for fun. But this time he is killing people that are making a movie about what happened in the first movie. Which means that it is the stupidest movie ever.<br /><br />Don't watch this. If you value the one precious hour during this movie then don't watch it. You'll want to ask the director and the person beside you what made him make it. Because it just doesn't combine the original makes of horror, action, and crime.<br /><br />Don't let your children watch this. Teenager, young child or young adult, this movie has that sorta impact upon people.",
    "Ah, Channel 5 of local Mexican t.v. Everyday, at 2:00 a.m. they air Horror movies from the 70's to early 2000's. It was \"Return To Cabin By The Lake\" the movie that aired yesterday. I regret for watching it.<br /><br />The original \"Cabin By The Lake\" was a regularly popular low budgeter and it was good accepted. The problem is that this sequel is horrible, not even unintentionally funny and tries to imitate the original. Ugh. The plot is really stupid in all the sense of the word.<br /><br />The movie at some points looks like a soap-opera because of it's absurd dialogs, cinematography, and direction.<br /><br />My advice is : avoid this one at all costs. It's a movie that it shouldn't be watched by anyone. Not even for lovers of mediocre film-making.<br /><br />You have been warned.",
    "Preposterous sequel stretches credibility to a great degree as diabolical sociopath Stanley Kaldwell returns this time infiltrating the movie production of the novel he wrote for the garden drownings, assuming the identity of a second unit director he murdered.<br /><br />Film pokes gleeful fun at Hollywood, with a tongue-in-cheek script taking shots at tyrannical directors who sleep with their actresses(..looking for a way up the ladder)and dislike anyone challenging them for complete spotlight. Brian Krause, who I thought was dreadful, overacting to the point where the satire felt incredibly forced, portrays the loud, temperamental director who doesn't like the fact that his second unit director and screenplay writer, Alison(..played by Dahlia Salem)seem to be taking over the production. Andrew Moxham is Paul Parsons, who is the brother of a victim from the first film. The film's dark humor this time takes the idea of a serial killer actually operating as director of a movie set and exploits it for all it's worth. Nelson again ably slides back into his psycho role without any difficulty, with Stanley as clever as ever, using his brains to commandeer a film production, killing whoever he has to in order to maintain full control of his work, letting no one stand in his way..that is until Alison realizes who Stanley really is. Alison is the type of ambitious writer who wants to capture the essence of her subject..what motivated Stanley to kill, why would he do such a thing, and what led such a man down this dark path? The humor of Alison actually working with that very man is also part of the satire at the heart of this dark comedy thriller. Of course, you get the inevitable showdown between Alison and Stanley, with a really ridiculous, unbelievable conclusion regarding the killer's fate(..quite a hard pill to swallow). Unlike the first film, which was photographed with sophisticated polish, director Po-Chih Leong uses unnecessary techniques which are not needed(..such as shooting an all kinds of weird angles, slow-motion in a sepia color, and several instances which are captured on video)and rather annoy instead of impress. This sequel, to me, just wasn't on target as much as the original, with a lot of the humor less effective and more obvious.",
    "Return to Cabin by the Lake just.... was lacking. It must have had a very low budget because a fair amount of the movie must have been filmed with a regular video camera. So, within the same scene - you'll have some movie-quality camera shots AND simple video camera shots. It makes for a very odd blend! I think they should have found SOME way to not do the \"home video\" type effect! <br /><br />I think it's worthwhile to see it IF you have seen the original CBTL because then you can compare and see the differences. But if you haven't seen the original CBTL.... you'll never want to see it if you see this one first! It will probably seem way too cheesy and turn you off from even caring about the original one.",
    "This movie was made-for-TV, so taking that into account, I'm not going to rip into it as hard as I would a feature film. The script is sub-par, but it does succeed in being mildly humorous in spots, whether it means to be or not. The acting is mostly over-the-top, but that is true for many lower-budget movies.<br /><br />The aspect of this movie that I really hated, though, was that 90-95% of it is shot on film, but in random places, there will be 5-10 seconds where the footage is shot on video. You can tell because there is less contrast, the colors are less vivid, and the footage is clearly 30 frames per second instead of film's 24 frames per second. I'm not sure if maybe these scenes had to be shot later and at that time they didn't have the money to shoot on film (I assume this is why, anyway), but it is disorienting and really makes the film look shoddier than it had to look.<br /><br />Anyway, I've definitely seen worse movies, but I definitely wouldn't say that I enjoyed this movie and I can't recommend that anyone see it.",
    "IF you are planning to see this movie, please reconsider. I don't usually post my comments about something I've seen on television, but this one was such a waste of my life that I needed to do something productive to get that bad taste out of my mouth. Critiquing this movie would take far too long as there are so many things wrong with it. I will just simply say, please do not ever see this movie. It was a complete waste of my time and it WILL be a waste of yours. Anyone that wrote a positive review of this movie is one of two things; utterly inept, or working for the company that produced it. Again, I guarantee that you will indeed regret seeing this movie!",
    "<br /><br />I saw this on the Sci-Fi channel. It came on right after the first one. For some reason this movie kept me interested. I don't know why, stop asking.<br /><br />---SPOILERS--- Okay... It was cheesy how this guy got involved with the making of the movie. In the first movie, he had a \"reason\" to kill people, but in this sequal, half of the killings/attempted killings were basicly for no reason. Stanley killed the director due to creative differences, he captured the co-writer due to creative differences, but what was the deal with trying to kill off the cast? No cast, no movie. He wanted it to \"look real when they died\"? If this was supposed to be such a high budget movie, use the special effects, MAN. Of course like the first one, the captured girl gets away, and Stanley ends up getting messed up, and dissapears. Woooooow (sarcasm). This movie HAD potential. And the saddest thing of all... the really sad part... I would watch a \"Cabin by the Lake 3\". Only because I like Judd Nelson, and he's the only good part about this sequal.",
    "I watched Cabin by the Lake this afternoon on USA. Considering this movie was made for TV is was interesting enough to watch the sequel. So, I tune in for the airing this evening and was extremely disappointed. I knew I wouldn't like the movie, but I was not expecting to be perplexed by the use of DV (digital video). The movie would have been tolerable if it wasn't for these juxtaposed digital shots that seemed to come from nowhere. I expected the plot line to be tied in with these shots, but there seemed to be no logical explanation. (WARNING: THE FOLLOWING MAYBE A SPOILER!!!!) The open ending in Cabin by the Lake was acceptable, but the open ending on the sequel is ridiculous. I can only foresee Return of Return to The Cabin by the Lake being watch able is if the movie was shown up against nothing, but infomercials at 4 o'clock in the morning.",
    "A decent sequel, but does not pack the punch of the original. A murderous screenwriter(Judd Nelson)assumes new identities in order to direct his own novel CABIN BY THE LAKE. Still ruthless killing, but movie seems very tongue-in-cheek. Any humor is not of the funny kind. Total project seems to have the quality of a quickie and at times Nelson is way over the top. This movie is about a script being rewritten before going to the screen...this should have happened to this script.",
    "Return to Cabin by the Lake does not, in any way, stand up to the original. With only one main character (Stanley) returning for the sequal, the film is not even worth the 2 hours of your time. I am a huge fan of the first film, the story line and acting was really good, but this is one movie that I will never again watch. It is basically equal to what the sequals to Urban Legends and Blair Witch were like, but with much worse acting. I've personally seen better acting in soap operas, it is so pitiful that you just have to laugh. I, in no way, recommend this movie to anyone, watching it will just detract from the first.",
    "I thought Hedy Burress (who managed to escape from the watery grave of part one) was going to be in part 2 Guess not. I just think they should of killed her off like in Friday The 13th Part 2 (you know what I mean).<br /><br />This movie like Scream 3, and Urban Legend 2 followed movies within a movie.<br /><br />This was PURE CRAP! The whole Movie within a Movie crap.<br /><br />BAD STAY AWAY!",
    "Viewers gushing over everything including the title sequence (now THAT is funny) would have us believe this is some sort of cinematic miracle, but, trust me folks, this is one of the most embarrassingly bad films you could ever see, and if you're not laughing at it five minutes in, I'd say you've lost your sense of humor.<br /><br />David Niven plays a doomed and bravado-besotted RAF pilot who somehow thinks it appropriate to engage an impressionable (female) air traffic controller in an emotional conversation about love, just as he's plunging to his certain and fiery death. (Isn't it romantic...) Of course, he's spared by a quirk of metaphysical chance, and washes up on the beach, just as this same air traffic controller is riding by on her bicycle. (They immediately clinch).<br /><br />Looking past the bizarre homo-erotic subtexts, (so over the top you really need to refer to them as supertexts, from a naked boy sitting bare-butted in the sand playing the movie's twilight-zone-esquire theme on his little flute, to a celestial courier so campy/queen-y his makeup is caked on more thoroughly than the ladies'), the most bizarre aspects of the movie are how it weaves such bad caricatures of national and racial stereotypes into a convoluted attempt to argue some kind of point about the universal nature and power of love. We get it--fly boys like girls in skirts and heels, and girls like 'em back, and, apparently, all you have to do is cry a little to make it noble enough for your movie to get 10 stars on IMDb...<br /><br />As for the quality of the production, the continuity/editing is poor enough to induce cringing, and the lighting is, perhaps, even worse than that, but you hardly have time to notice because the script is so bad. There are games played with Technicolor, (whatever passes for heaven is in black and white if you can figure out the sense in that), and foreshadowing, (so funny my fellow audience member who usually like movies like this actually cheered and laughed when then the doc's motorcycle finally ended up in a fiery wreck), and freeze-motion, (which is funniest of all because the female lead is so poor at standing still you know the stage hands were guffawing off camera).<br /><br />The best shots are the early ones on the beach, but, after that, it's all downhill. The (moving like an escalator is moving) staircase is hardly the Odessa Steps, to say the least, and I'd really caution anyone from feeling like they'd have to see this lame attempt at movie-making on their account. The movie overall is bad enough to be funny, and that's about the best thing I can say for it."

    "I rented *I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW* due to its notorious controversy at release in 1967. Originally seized by U.S. customs, its reputation as a \"controversial\" film piqued my interest.\n\nThe plot revolves around Lena, a young Swedish drama student eager to explore life. She aims to create a documentary on what average Swedes think about political issues like the Vietnam War and U.S. race relations. Alongside her interviews with Stockholm’s politicians and residents, she engages in sexual relationships with her drama teacher, classmates, and married men.\n\nWhat surprises me is that 40 years ago, this film was considered pornographic. The sex and nudity scenes are sparse and not filmed like cheap porn. Despite potential shock to others, sex and nudity are common in Swedish cinema, even in the works of respected director Ingmar Bergman.\n\nI applaud the filmmakers for using sex artistically rather than for shock value or profit in American porn theaters. *I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW* is valuable for studying Swedish cinema, though it lacks a substantial plot.",
    "\"I Am Curious: Yellow\" is a pretentious and frivolous film. Male frontal nudity doesn't automatically result in an NC-17 rating; R-rated films can include brief male nudity. However, explicit female genitalia are absent in R-rated films and mainstream media, indicating cultural discomfort with female anatomy. Complaints about a double standard in nudity miss that female genitals aren't displayed onscreen outside of porn or explicit erotica.",
    "To steer clear of producing films like this in the future, it's worth noting that while this movie serves as an intriguing experiment, it fails to deliver a coherent narrative.\n\nWhile viewers might feel a sense of moral righteousness for enduring it, given its coverage of numerous IMPORTANT topics, it ultimately lacks any clear purpose. Watching it, you'll depart without any fresh insights, unless your mind drifts—an inevitable occurrence during such a purposeless film.\n\nYour time might be better spent observing the growth of a tree outside your window.",
    "This film seems to draw inspiration from Godard's \"Masculin, féminin,\" but if you truly want a captivating experience, I highly recommend watching the original instead.\n\nWhile the film boasts two notable strengths—the realistic acting and the surprisingly good cinematography—it's hard to overlook the overwhelming silliness throughout. Lena Nyman's performance feels frustratingly naïve, and the excessive nudity does nothing to make it more appealing. In stark contrast to Godard's intellectual approach, this film replaces depth with superficiality, perhaps reflecting the differing cultural ideals of French and Swedish societies of the time.\n\nIn the end, it's a product of its era and origin. My rating: 2/10.",
    "Oh, boy... After hearing endless hype about this absurd movie for what feels like an eternity, I can't help but recall that old Peggy Lee tune... \n\n\"Is that all there is?\" I was just a young teenager when this bizarre film made its splash in the U.S. Too young to watch it in theaters (though I did manage to sneak into \"Goodbye Columbus\"). Years later, a local film museum had a screening - finally, my chance to see it, but now I was as old as my parents were when they reluctantly went to see it!\n\nThe ONLY reason this film didn't vanish into obscurity was its infamous obscenity case upon its U.S. release. MILLIONS flocked to see this dud, expecting a racy film... Instead, they got a slew of closeups of unpleasant Swedes, street interviews in bland shopping centers, ridiculous political posturing, and lifeless pseudo-sex scenes with uninspiring, pale actors.\n\nCultural icon, holy grail, historic artifact—whatever you want to call it, just shred it, burn it, and bury the ashes in a lead box!\n\nElite critics still scramble to unearth some value in its dull, pseudo-revolutionary political ramblings. But if not for the censorship controversy, it would have been ignored and forgotten.\n\nYet, the \"I Am Blank, Blank\" title was echoed for years as a tease for various films (I Am Curious, Lavender for LGBTQ films, I Am Curious, Black for blaxploitation films, etc.), and every decade or so, it gets resurrected for another batch of curious viewers hunting for that \"naughty sex film\" that \"changed cinema forever...\"\n\nGood grief, steer clear of it like the plague. Or if you absolutely must see it – rent the video and skip to the \"dirty\" parts just to get it over with.",
    "This is at the top of my list of unwatchable films. There are bad movies, and then there are those you're expected to appreciate but can't even sit through. The once-shocking sex scenes are now dull, and the controversial politics are juvenile Marxism. The film is pretentiously artsy, with harsh, grainy black-and-white photography, out-of-focus scenes, poor angles, and bad sound. How can anyone call this art?",
    "The screenplay for this movie clearly missed the mark on accurately depicting Lucille Ball's life, showing no evidence of research, not even from her autobiography. The film is riddled with factual errors, covering her early days in Celoron and Jamestown to her later life with Desi Arnaz. The number of inaccuracies is staggering, enough to fill pages. Lucille Ball is a unique, inimitable person who cannot be authentically portrayed by anyone else. If I were Lucie Arnaz or Desi Arnaz Jr., I would be furious at the numerous mistakes made in this film. Despite the filmmakers' efforts, the movie comes across as extremely sloppy.",
    "When I first caught a glimpse of this movie, I immediately noticed the actress playing Lucille Ball. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucy is utterly disappointing. Lucille Ball was an astounding comedian with remarkable talent, and seeing a legend like her depicted so poorly is distressing. It's unbelievable that, out of all the actresses who could have done Lucy justice, the producers chose Rachel York. While York might excel in other roles, capturing Lucille Ball's essence is a formidable challenge. Though finding a perfect match for Lucille Ball in terms of looks and talent is difficult, they could have cast someone closer to her qualities. York's performance in classic \"I Love Lucy\" scenes, such as the chocolate factory or vitameatavegamin episodes, fails to capture Lucy's expressions, voice, or movements in any way.\n\nAdding to the disappointment, Danny Pino's portrayal of Desi Arnaz is dreadful. Pino doesn't fit Ricky's character; he's small and skinny, his accent is unconvincing, and his acting is far from believable. Although Fred and Ethel were not spot-on either, they were at least not as egregiously miscast as Lucy and Ricky.\n\nOverall, the casting is terrible, and the story is poorly conveyed. For those wishing to understand the real-life story of Lucille Ball, I recommend watching A&E's Biography of Lucy and Desi, reading Lucille Ball's autobiography, or viewing PBS' American Masters: Finding Lucy. For a better docudrama, \"Before the Laughter\" is a superior choice, offering a much closer representation of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz.",
    "Who are the \"They\" being referenced here? Actors? Filmmakers? It certainly can't be the audience—this film ranks among the most superficial productions ever. It feels like everyone had a blast making it, maybe too much fun, to the point where nobody seemed to actually work. That vibe typically translates to a film that's not enjoyable to watch.\n\nJohn Ritter wears glasses to underline his character's resemblance to the bespectacled Peter Bogdanovich, but the scenes with the charming Dorothy Stratten, while sweet, give off a cringy \"look, I'm dating the prom queen\" vibe. Ben Gazzara tries to inject some life into a lackluster plot but fails, mostly wandering through scenes with a sleepy disinterest while supposedly chasing Audrey Hepburn. Concurrently, the children of the budding couple (interestingly played by Bogdanovich's daughters) throw around cuteness while absorbing some questionable lessons about love, just by observing their parents. Audrey Hepburn admirably rises above it all, essentially playing herself, which isn't too much of a stretch. Sure, everyone looks fabulous, but if that's what you're after, you might as well flip through Vogue.\n\nIt needs to be pointed out that Colleen Camp manages to be thoroughly annoying, even before she starts singing. While her singing is passable, it's entirely unconvincing. The country and western numbers clash so badly with the rest of the soundtrack you have to wonder what Gershwin, whose song inspired the film's title, would think. Gershwin's musical comedies of the 1920s may have been lightweight, but they were certainly charming. \"They All Laughed\" tries to coast on good intentions, but Peter Bogdanovich fails to rein it in.\n\nThe tragic death of Dorothy Stratten gives this film a special place in Bogdanovich's heart. He went so far as to buy it back from the producers and distribute it himself, ultimately going bankrupt when it didn't succeed. His Hollywood journey is one of the more sympathetic and tragic tales, so it's no pleasure to criticize this film. There is genuine emotion in Stratten's scenes, but \"They All Laughed\" pales in comparison to \"The Last Picture Show,\" \"Paper Moon,\" or \"What's Up, Doc?\" With this film, along with \"Daisy Miller\" and \"At Long Last Love,\" Bogdanovich's decline was cemented.\n\nIn the end, the movie is harmless, just a waste of a rental. If I want to see people enjoying themselves, I'll head to the park on a sunny day. For cinematic expressions of joy and love, I'll stick with Ernst Lubitsch and Jacques Demy.",
    "Peter Bogdanovich's film, based loosely on his life, features detectives who effortlessly date beautiful models, resembling millionaire playboys more than sleuths. Written entirely by Bogdanovich, the movie reflects his detachment from reality, resulting in a narrative that leaves audiences bored, confused, and perhaps jealous. It's primarily a curio for those interested in seeing Dorothy Stratten, who was tragically murdered post-filming. Patti Hansen, a model who later married Keith Richards, delivers a far more significant and compelling performance than Stratten, whose role feels tacked on and irrelevant to the convoluted plot. Ultimately, the film is an irritating snore fest, relatable only to a rarefied few, filled with insider jokes that alienate most viewers.",
    "It was nostalgic and enjoyable to see some of my favorite stars from 30 years ago, including John Ritter, Ben Gazarra, and Audrey Hepburn, who all looked quite wonderful. However, they were not given substantial characters or compelling lines to work with. I neither understood nor cared what the characters were supposed to be doing.\n\nSome of the supporting female roles were well-acted. Patty Henson and Colleen Camp were competent and confident in their small sidekick parts, showcasing their talent. It's unfortunate they didn't go on to star in more prominent films. Dorothy Stratten, sadly, didn't get much opportunity to demonstrate her acting in what was her only significant film role.\n\nThe film does have some fans, and I approached it with an open mind as a big Peter Bogdanovich admirer. I enjoyed his recent film \"Cat's Meow\" and all his early works from \"Targets\" to \"Nickelodeon.\" Therefore, it was quite surprising that I struggled to stay awake while watching this one.\n\nIronically, this movie centers on a detective agency where detectives and clients develop romantic relationships. Five years later, Bogdanovich's ex-girlfriend, Cybill Shepherd, starred in the hit television series \"Moonlighting,\" which borrowed this plot idea. The primary difference is that the series thrived on witty dialogue, whereas this film relied on slapstick and sporadic screwball lines.\n\nBottom line: It’s no \"Paper Moon,\" and a very pale version of \"What's Up, Doc.\"",
    "Those praising this movie must be thinking of another film. I expected it to be bad, but the script (or lack thereof) renders it pointless. While the actors and crew are competent, they can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. Ben G fans should watch any of his other movies; Dorothy S fans should watch \"Galaxina\"; Peter B fans should stick to \"Last Picture Show\" and \"Target.\" For cheap laughs, read Peter B's terrible book, \"Killing of the Unicorn.\"",
    "Under no circumstances should models and Playboy bunnies be cast in films. Bob Fosse's \"Star 80,\" which delves into the tragic life of Dorothy Stratten, whom Peter Bogdanovich was so enamored with that he later married her sister after Dorothy's murder, is infinitely more compelling than Stratten herself ever was on screen. Patty Hansen lacks any credibility as an actress. My anticipation of witnessing a lost masterpiece akin to Orson Welles' work was dashed, as what I encountered instead was Audrey Hepburn donning jeans and sporting a dreadful \"poodlesque\" hairstyle—an utterly disappointing experience. Unlike \"Paper Moon\" and \"The Last Picture Show,\" which I can rewatch countless times, this film was an ordeal to endure even once. Allegedly, its release was hindered by the controversy surrounding Ms. Stratten's sordid demise; however, the true reason was undoubtedly its poor quality.",
    "It's not the cast. You won't find a better group of actors anywhere. It's not the setting either. The director is head over heels in love with New York City, and by the end of the film, you'll be too! Even Woody Allen couldn't top what Bogdonovich has done here. If you're looking to fall in love or find love, Manhattan's the place to be. Nope, the problem with the movie is the script. There isn't one. The actors fall in love at first sight, and words aren't needed. In the director's experience in Hollywood, that's just how things go on set. It feels real to him and his peers but is pure fantasy for most of us. So, in the end, the movie feels hollow, shallow, and doesn't really say anything.",
    "Today, I found the VHS of \"They All Laughed\" on sale at a rental store. Despite it being an old and heavily used tape, the cover attracted me with names like Peter Bogdanovich, Audrey Hepburn, John Ritter, and especially Dorothy Stratten. The price was very low, so I decided to buy it. After checking IMDb, which rated it 6.0, and seeing it received four stars in the \"Mick Martin & Marsha Porter Video & DVD Guide 2003\", I decided to watch it right away. However, I found the movie boring and overrated. The characters were poorly developed, making it hard to understand their roles. The plot, which revolves around private detectives falling in love with the women they are tailing, failed to amuse me. The coincidences in a city as large as New York felt absurd, and Ben Gazarra's portrayal of a seductive man was unconvincing. The main attractions were Dorothy Stratten, whose tragic story is well-documented, the stunning Patti Hansen, the timeless beauty of Audrey Hepburn, and the song \"Amigo\" by Roberto Carlos, who, despite my personal preferences, is hugely popular in Brazil. I will keep the movie in my collection only for these elements, particularly Dorothy Stratten. My rating is four out of ten.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"Muito Riso e Muita Alegria\" (\"Many Laughs and Lots of Happiness\")",
    "This film is truly terrible. John Ritter is clumsy, 75% of the actors sound like they're reading from cue cards, the editing is poor, and the sound mixing is awful, making dialogue hard to hear over background noise. The plot goes nowhere. Surprisingly, Dorothy Stratten isn't the worst actress; at least three others are worse. Patti Hansen delivers her lines with the enthusiasm of Ben Stein, making me wonder if she's dead inside. Even Bogdanovich's kids are awful, with the oldest clearly reading from a cue card. This movie is seriously bad, which explains why Bogdanovich couldn't secure another project for four years. Please don't watch it. If it's on TV, cancel your cable. If a friend suggests it, reconsider your friendship. If your spouse wants to watch it, find a new soulmate. I'd rather gouge my eyes out with lawn darts than endure this garbage again. In one word: sucktastic.",
    "I bought this video because I was interested in Dorothy Stratten. Despite having a great cast, there were too many subplots to keep my attention. The dialogue was stiff and confusing, and the story jumped around too much to be believable. I was disappointed, especially considering this was one of Audrey Hepburn's final films. I prefer John Ritter in slapstick roles; his performance here was just too pathetic.",
    "I plan to make a movie next weekend. Oh, I forgot I'm working... but I'll find a way to fit it in. It seems like the creators of this film managed to squeeze it into their schedule. I hope they have regular jobs because this film was terrible! It looks like a home movie, and I doubt more than $100 was spent on it! Complete garbage! How does this kind of stuff get released?!",

Made on what appears to be a shoestring budget of around $20, TZC is an utterly dreadful horror film featuring dreadful actors who can't act and gore that is more nauseating than scary. It is baffling how such a movie even gets made. Simply put, avoid TZC like a contagious disease.<br /><br />Final thoughts: Amusingly, this movie was produced by a company named Brain Damage Films. Their brains must have genuinely been damaged to create such a terrible movie.<br /><br />My rating: 1 out of 10 (If I had my way, this movie would receive a rating of negative infinity)",
    "If the team behind \"Zombie Chronicles\" ever sees this, here are a few tips:\n\n1. In movies with \"Twist Endings,\" avoid showing close-ups of every death during the opening credits. It spoils the surprises.\n2. Despite your limited budget (and bravo for what you achieved with it), please invest in actors who can convincingly walk, talk, and gesture simultaneously. Joe Haggerty, this means you.\n3. When setting part of your movie in the past, ensure you have the appropriate props and costumes to reflect the time period accurately.\n4. Twist endings should be unexpected. While we don't want nonsensical twists, giving away the \"reveal\" as soon as a character is introduced ruins the suspense.\n\nKudos for the effort, but honestly, I'd prefer you hadn't made it. Only die-hard zombie enthusiasts might enjoy this.",
    "First watched on 8/3/2003 - 2 out of 10 (Dir-Brad Sykes): This 3D movie attempts to captivate with its depiction of flesh-eating zombies in a series of intertwined stories, but sadly it falls flat. While the 3D effects aim to add a new dimension to the familiar sight of zombies feasting on human flesh, this gimmick has been overused and lacks the depth that true zombie classics possess. It’s not the flesh-eating that carries a great zombie film; it’s the compelling, underlying story that truly engages the audience. \n\nUnfortunately, this movie fails to deliver on that front, presenting a tedious three-part narrative that feels like a dull, slow-paced imitation of Twilight Zone episodes. The predictable plot twists and lackluster storytelling result in a viewing experience that leaves you bored rather than thrilled. The final segment, revisiting the initial plot of a reporter investigating a supposed ghost town, delivers more of the same repetitive, unengaging content.\n\nIf you’re a fan of the zombie genre, it's better to revisit the timeless classics that masterfully combine gripping stories with moments of visceral horror. Skip this lackluster 3D effort and seek out films that offer a more rewarding and memorable experience.",
    "There are many attractive women in this movie, but there's no nudity in it, which is disappointing.\n\nOne part of the movie is set in 1971, yet the characters are driving a Kia Sportage, which doesn't match the time period. That’s a big continuity error.\n\nThis movie was released in 3D, but the effect was terrible. It just looked like blurry double vision. I didn't have this problem with this company's other 3D movies, \"Hunting Season\" and \"Camp Blood.\" Although the 3D in those films wasn't great, at least there was some 3D effect.\n\nOverall, the movie is really bad.\n\nHowever, the actress who played the daughter of the ear-eating woman was very attractive. I'd like to see more of her in films. She reminded me of a young Janet Margolin.",
    "En route to a small, remote town that intriguingly appears close to a freeway, a female reporter encounters a peculiar hitchhiker who offers to guide her to her destination. The hitchhiker shares two gruesome stories tied to the area: in the first, an adulterous couple plots to kill the woman's husband, only to face a far worse fate when they are attacked by a zombie; in the second, a group of campers has their vacation abruptly cut short by an undead outlaw angered when his grave is desecrated.\n\n\"The Zombie Chronicles\" is an attempt by writer Garrett Clancy and director Brad Sykes to create a zombie-themed anthology. It's a nice idea, but with just two stories, it falls short. This low-budget gore flick fails in several aspects: the acting is poor (particularly Joe Haggerty as the storyteller Ebenezer Jackson, who gives one of the strangest performances I've seen), the locations are uninspired, the script is dull, there's a sex scene with no nudity, and the ending is simply unbelievable.\n\nOn a positive note, some of Sykes' creative camerawork is effective, though the gimmicky technique used as characters run through the woods is overplayed. Joe Castro's budget-friendly gore effects are enthusiastic, featuring an ear being bitten off, eyeballs being plucked out, a face being removed, brains being squished, and a messy decapitation. These aspects make the film somewhat bearable, but be warned: \"The Zombie Chronicles\" is no easy watch, even for seasoned viewers of z-grade trash.\n\nI initially gave \"The Zombie Chronicles\" a 2/10 but am generously raising my rating to 3, considering I didn't watch it in 3D (though I suspect an extra dimension wouldn't have made much difference).",
    "I don't want to be a downer, but Brad Sykes has made at least two of the most boring and cliché-ridden movies I've ever seen - this one and Camp Blood. \n\nThe acting is horrendous, the quality is poor, and everything about this film practically begs the question, \"Seriously, could you make something better yourself?\" Maybe it's a challenge for all of us to flood YouTube with our own zombie-themed nonsense?\n\nI bought this for £1, but remember, you can't put a price on 71 minutes of your life. Do yourself a favor and skip this dud, even if it’s in the bargain bin.",
    "My girlfriend once brought over The Zombie Chronicles for us to watch as a joke. Little did we know the joke was on her for spending £1 on it. While watching, I began thinking of things I would rather do than watch The Zombie Chronicles. These included:\n\n1) Drinking bleach\n2) Rubbing sand in my eyes\n3) Writing a letter to Brad Sykes and Garrett Clancy\n4) Re-enacting the American Civil War\n5) Doing tax returns\n6) Taking a GCSE Maths exam\n7) Having sex with an old lady\n\nGarrett Clancy, also known as Sgt. Ben Draper, wrote this? The guy couldn't even dig a hole properly. The best thing he did was kick down a door, which was the highlight of the film. This is the worst film I have ever seen, and I’ve seen White Noise: The Light. Never has a film had so many mistakes. My girlfriend left it here, so now I live with the shame of owning this piece of garbage.\n\nBreaking news: Owen Wilson watched this film and tried to kill himself. Fact.\n\nDO NOT WATCH.",
    "Amateur, no-budget films can be surprisingly good; however, this is not one of them.\n\nAh, another Brad Sykes atrocity. The acting is hideous, except for Emmy Smith who shows some promise. The camera \"direction\" needs serious reworking. And no more \"hold the camera and run\" gimmicks either; it just doesn't work. The special effects are unimaginative; there's a problem when the effect can be identified in real time. If you're going to rip off an ear, please don't let us see the actor's real ear beneath the blood. The scenery is bland and boring (same as Mr. Sykes' other ventures), and the music is a cross between cheap motel porn and really bad guitar-driven metal (see the scenery comment).\n\nDid I mention the lack of any real plot or character development? Apparently, the scriptwriter didn't.\n\nWhoever is funding this guy, please stop. I've seen some of his other \"home movies\" (which I will not plug), and they are just as bad. Normally, a \"director\" will grow and learn from his previous efforts; not this guy. It's one thing to be an amateur filmmaker, but anyone can be a hack.\n\nDefinitely not even a popcorn film; of course, chewing on popcorn kernels would be less painful than this effort.\n\nAward: The worst ever military push-ups in a film.",
    "It's not the best film I've ever seen, but I've watched it twice! The storyline was pretty terrible, and during the first part, I questioned what I was even watching. However, it was so bad that I ended up loving it for the cheap laughs.\n\nJebidia deserves an Oscar for his role, though he fell short when he stopped his funny name-calling halfway through.\n\nOverall, the film was pretty pathetic, but if you're looking for cheap laughs and see it at a discount store, go ahead and buy it.",
    "Some films you buy for a pound can turn out to be surprisingly good. For example, 23rd Century Films released dozens of obscure Italian and American movies that were excellent. However, while Hardgore did release some noteworthy Fulci films, most of their output is lackluster, like The Zombie Chronicles.\n\nThe only positive thing I can say about this film is that it's not as annoying as The Stink of Flesh. Beyond that, it’s a very clumsy anthology film with the technical skill equivalent to a Lego house built by a snail.\n\nAs has been pointed out elsewhere, you really have to be concerned about a film that includes previews of its action in the credit sequence, so by the time you see the actual zombie attacks, it's all old news.\n\nFans of bad movies might enjoy spotting the 18,000 continuity mistakes and the atrocious acting (especially from the hitchhiker, whose poor performance did make me laugh a bit). Kudos to Hardgore for embracing the spirit of things by releasing such a poor-quality print—it felt like watching a worn-out home video of a camping trip.\n\nAwful, awful stuff. We've all made films like this when we've first gotten our hands on a camera, but common sense usually keeps them hidden away in our cupboards. Avoid this one.",
    "I got this movie as a gift, and just from the DVD cover, I had a feeling it was going to be terrible. After avoiding it for over a year, I finally sat down to watch it, and it was utterly dreadful.\n\nI nearly gave up on finishing it, but I felt it would be unfair to review it without seeing the entire movie.\n\nBelieve me when I say, \"this movie is awful.\" I'm amazed that some wannabe filmmaker was able to secure funding to make such a pathetic film. It likely cost no more than $20,000 to produce, requiring only a cheap camcorder or a phone camera, about 15 people with no acting talent, and a script that seemed to be written by a couple of drunken individuals.\n\nIn the first part of this horrendous film, a reporter named Tara Woodley hits a supposedly drunk man with her car on her way to report on a haunted town. Remarkably, he is completely unharmed. They go to what is supposed to be an abandoned house, but it is conveniently almost fully furnished, and a bottle of liquor just happens to be on the doorstep for the drunk man. But all is not as it seems.\n\nThen, the supposed drunk man starts telling ghost and zombie stories to Tara.\n\nThe first of these ridiculous stories is arguably the worst ever.\n\nIn his tale, Sgt. Ben Draper allows one of his soldiers, Private Wilson, to die from total exhaustion after making him do sit-ups and then dig a grave. When the soldier collapses, Draper buries him in a shallow grave.\n\nHowever, Sgt. Draper gets a big surprise when his wife or girlfriend, who knows about the event, along with her lover, kills Draper to avenge Private Wilson. Next to the soldier's grave, Private Wilson rises from the grave as a zombie and kills them in revenge for himself.\n\nThe twist ending was incredibly lame.\n\nEven if you're a fan of B horror movies, do yourself a favor and skip this one.",
    "I've not seen many low-budget films, but I must confess, this one might be the worst. The lead character, an elderly man, spoke as if he had undergone a lobotomy, struggling to articulate more than one word every five seconds - a five-year-old could have performed better. The plot was abysmal, and the army guy exaggerated his role to the point of absurdity. I watched it purely for the unintended comedy, hoping it was just a prelude to the real movie. It's astonishing it was available under the two-night rental at Blockbuster and not a \"take it for free\" offer. There was one actor who was somewhat decent besides the woman, though. The only semi-acceptable aspect linked to the budget was the makeup. However, they managed to spoil it by revealing all the key scenes during the opening music sequence. Simply dreadful.",
    "Oh wait, I can! This movie is not for the typical film snob, unless you want a refresher on cinematic terms like \"continuity editing\" and \"geographic match.\" I couldn't tell where I was in this movie. One moment they're in the present, and the next they're supposedly in the '70s, driving a modern SUV while wearing what looked like '80s-style clothing. I think. I couldn't focus long enough because the acting was just horrible. I believe it only garnered attention because it's available in 3D, which I didn't watch. If you're a b-movie enthusiast, and by b-movie I mean BAD movie, then this film is for you. Its home-movie, nonsensical style will keep you laughing for as long as you can stay awake. However, if you prefer the works of Godard and Antonioni, just skip this one.",
    "You have to admire Brad Sykes, even if you're not inclined to. He continuously produces low-budget horror films despite lukewarm receptions. Despite the half-hearted praise that begrudgingly surrounds his Camp Blood series, Sykes persists, always adding a neat idea, quirky character, or some interesting element. Lacking the funds to elevate his films beyond a basic level, he relies on audiences to appreciate them for what they are and envision what they could be. Joe Haggerty delivers a spirited and hilarious performance as Ebenezer Jackson, and it's a testament to Sykes' talent that he can recognize the potential of such an eccentric portrayal within his films. Expect to see his work at a multiplex near you—in a parallel universe.",
    "**The Zombie Chronicles**\n\n**Aspect ratio:** 1.33:1 (Nu-View 3-D)\n\n**Sound format:** Mono\n\nPicture this: A young reporter named Emmy Smith is on the hunt for a literal ghost town in the middle of nowhere. Along the way, she picks up a rough-around-the-edges hitchhiker, Joseph Haggerty. He spins two spooky tales about flesh-eating zombies that supposedly haunt the area.\n\nNow, if you're thinking this sounds like the setup for a thrilling zombie flick, brace yourself. Haggerty's performance is unfortunately pretty cringe-worthy, which is a major downside right from the get-go. And those two spooky stories? They're actually pretty dull, made worse by the not-so-great acting and lackluster direction from Brad Sykes, the guy who brought us Camp Blood (1999).\n\nThis movie isn't bad in a fun way, like some of Ed Wood's cult classics. Instead, Sykes' homemade style falls flat, making the whole thing more of a bore than a thrill. Most viewers will probably feel frustrated and let down by this unimaginative, poorly put-together film. And the 3-D aspect? Totally wasted here.",
    "A woman seeking directions to a mysterious town is treated to two eerie zombie tales by the local oddball. But little does she know, fate has its own grim surprises... \n\n\"The Zombie Chronicles\" isn't just bad—it's disastrously, mind-numbingly abysmal. Imagine a film so atrocious, I fast forwarded through most of its tedious, cringeworthy content—and, believe me, there was a lot to skip. Clocking in at a mere 69 minutes, it still manages to cram in an unbearable amount of filler. Picture a skinhead continuously doing push-ups, lifeless romantic scenes between awkward teens (they rhyme, tee hee), and acting so horrendous, you'll question humanity's sense of talent.\n\nThe title “zombies”? Mere afterthoughts. You'll glimpse more undead antics in the opening credits than in the entire film! Yet, given how laughably awful the bulging eyes and brain-eating scenes are among other 'delights,' maybe that's a mercy.\n\nTo add to the misery, the film looks like it was shot on an ancient mobile phone destined for YouTube. Expect jerky camera work, scratched film, and flickering lights. I had to double-check when I saw it was made in 2001—it feels like a dreadful relic from 1971. Even the characters’ wardrobe and hairstyles scream outdated by about 30 years.\n\nThink I’m exaggerating? Try enduring the film yourself; I bet you won't last past the first sighting of the blue-colored freaks before you run for the hills. The fact that this disasterpiece was ever released is a cosmic joke. Honestly, using the DVD as a coaster would bring you far more joy than subjecting any player to this laughable horror attempt. Your DVD player might even flee, leaving you in VHS purgatory. You've been warned... 0/10.\n\nP.S. Seriously, what kind of 18-rated horror keeps the woman in a giant sports bra during the \"obligatory\" sex scene? This disaster can't even get that part right...",
    "Honestly, I can't believe I spent $5 on this movie. As a huge zombie enthusiast, I figured it couldn't be that bad because, after all, it featured zombies. Boy, was I mistaken! While the movie had a few noteworthy moments—like the scene where the guy's head gets ripped off—that was about the only highlight. Overall, I think it would be more pleasant to endure a highly painful scenario than to sit through this movie again. It might have been more entertaining if there had been some nudity, but I had to watch the trailers for other movies produced by this company to see that. Buyer beware... unless you enjoy suffering.",
    "I rented this film around three years ago, and it still lingers in my memory as the most terrible movie I've ever watched. I don’t think I even finished it. It’s worse than a homemade video by a high schooler. I recall a flashback to the 1970s, and in that scene, a man was wearing a polo shirt and Oakley sunglasses, and driving a modern SUV, something like a Toyota Rav-4 (I can’t quite remember). I can't fathom how they could claim that was the 70s. He might have had a cell phone too, I’m not sure. It was utterly dreadful. I returned it to the video store and questioned why they even stocked the movie, and if I could get that wasted hour of my life back. To this day, it remains the worst film I have ever seen, and I’ve watched some really bad ones.",
    "**Spoilers Ahead**\n\nI had high hopes for \"Love's Abiding Joy,\" especially since I've been eagerly waiting for it to re-air on Hallmark. While I'm a big fan of the first three \"Love\" movies, this one really missed the mark for me. \n\nInstead of the inspiring and touching story I was expecting, the movie turned out to be overwhelmingly sad and depressing. The lack of continuity and poor editing didn't help either, with too many scenes feeling out of place. The premature death of baby Kathy felt jarring, and Clark's appearance seemed oddly forced and disconnected from the rest of the story. The cast also seemed disengaged, lacking the emotional depth that made the previous films so gripping. There was hardly any chemistry or interaction between Missie and Willie, which was disappointing.\n\nI wish the screenwriters had stayed truer to Janette Oke's original novels. Vital plot points from the book, like the mine and the two boys or Clark’s injury, were completely overlooked. Missie and Willie's reactions to Kathy's death deserved more screen time and depth, rather than being briefly touched upon.\n\nAfter four films, \"Love's Abiding Joy\" has become my least favorite. Looking ahead, I hope the next installments stick closer to the source material. If Clark's character returns, I hope he gets a more substantial role that's more engaging. It would also be great to see more of Scottie, Cookie, and maybe even Marty. Who knows what the scriptwriters have in store, but I remain cautiously optimistic.",
    "I have watched all four movies in this series, and each one deviates further from the books. This one is the worst yet. The main issue is that it doesn't follow the book it's named after at all! The directors and producers should have given it a different title. The only similarity to the book is the names of some of the characters (Willie, Missie, Henry, Clark, Scottie, and Cookie). The children’s names, ages, and genders are incorrect. The entire storyline does not exist in the book.\n\nI believe this is a great disservice to Janette Oke, her books, and her fans to produce a movie with her title that is so inaccurate. The music is too loud and the actors are unconvincing, lacking in emotion.\n\nIf you want a good family movie, this could work as it is wholesome. However, don’t watch it if you’re expecting a condensed version of the book. I hope this will be the final movie in the series, though I doubt it. If more movies are made, I wish Michael Landon, Jr., and others would adhere more closely to the original plot and storylines. The books are outstanding and would make excellent movies if followed closely!",
    "I was really excited for this movie. It's a great family flick, but honestly, if Michael Landon Jr.'s team had done a better job with the editing, it would have been way better. There were just too many scenes that didn't make sense. I really hope they make another movie in the series because they're all great. But if they do, I seriously hope they fix the editing. This one was all over the place with no clear focus, which is a shame because the other movies were awesome. I love the story of Willie and Missy; they're such great role models. And let's face it, everyone loves a good love story.",
    "I've read all the Love Come Softly books and understand that movies can't capture every detail, but they usually stick to the main plot. However, I was very disappointed with this film. The only similarity between the movie and the book is that Missy's father visits (though in the book, both parents visit). The rest of the story was so distorted and implausible that I couldn't enjoy it, even without having read the book. It was overly sad and, while I know pioneer life was tough, the entire movie felt depressing. My rating is solely for maintaining the family-oriented aspect that makes these films appealing.",
    "As a Southern Baptist, it saddens me to give a below-average rating to a Christian movie, especially since there are so few of them and I don't want to discourage filmmakers in this under-explored genre. However, I must be honest: \"Love's Abiding Joy\" is a low-budget, low-key film that is self-consciously Christian. The plot is predictable, the acting is mediocre (to put it kindly), and the editing is poor. While it might have fared better as a TV movie, as a feature film, it falls short. Keep at it, though. I'm sure you have a great movie about real Christians in you somewhere. Maybe look to G.K. Chesterton or C.S. Lewis for some inspiration?",
    "As a child, I thought the weapon the murderer used was cool, but I was also quite naive. Even then, I found the movie's plot to be dull and uninteresting whenever the killer wasn't using his light knife to kill people. What surprises me is the strong cast in the film. I wonder what script they read before agreeing to participate because the movie is undoubtedly boring and seems to exist just to showcase a light saber on a small scale. At times, the plot is incomprehensible, and the ending is completely chaotic. The entire film revolves around aliens and that single weapon. The story involves two kids and a man having an alien encounter, flashing forward several years to a supposed return of the aliens. There are dead animals to investigate, and for some reason, the man acquires the aliens' weapon and goes on a minor killing spree. Honestly, you have to question the purpose of this film. If you're going to feature a killer, there should be good death scenes; if you're showcasing alien encounters, show more than a strange light vortex; and if you're using light sabers, you might as well call yourself Star Wars.",
    "Jill Dunne (Mitzi Kapture) is an attractive, stressed woman, burdened by her smart-mouthed teenage daughter, Liv (Martha MacIsaac), and her petty, two-timing husband, Sean (Rick Roberts), both of whom are insufferably self-centered and obnoxious.\n\nMarketed as a thriller about a family stalked by a crazed killer during a relentless storm, the storm only appears in the last five minutes and is far from threatening. The stalking also doesn't intensify until the film's end.\n\nMost of the movie focuses on Jill arguing with her unbearable daughter, Liv, who has taken up with Zack, a boy of questionable character. They are often seen making out, much to Jill's frustration. Meanwhile, Sean continuously complains and criticizes Jill.\n\nThe story kicks off with Jill discovering a hotel charge on their credit card, leading her to suspect Sean. She visits the hotel and meets the sympathetic owner, Richard Grant (Nick Mancuso). When Richard spots Sean there again, he tips off Jill, who witnesses Sean with another woman but does nothing about it.\n\nJill later reconnects with Richard, and they grow close. Just as things heat up, Jill pulls back. Subsequently, Jill confronts Sean about his cheating, leading to a confrontation where Sean blames Jill for his infidelity. Jill confesses her near-infidelity to Sean, who, unsurprisingly, blames her for that too.\n\nThe dysfunctional family heads out on a camping trip, filled with more whining and arguing, particularly from the spoiled daughter.\n\nBy the end, I was rooting for the stalker to get everyone except Jill.\n\n3 stars",
    "This movie was terrible. Honestly, it felt like a total waste of time. The acting was awful, and the plot made no sense. Basically, these people get \"terrorized\" by a so-called \"crazed killer\" but don't even try to fight back. They go on a camping trip with a raft but no gear, and end up at a campsite that's already set up with food, clothes, and even the daughter's headphones. When their boat goes missing, they freak out about being stuck in the woods, but then the daughter's boyfriend just shows up out of nowhere. They never think about just hiking out like he did. Seriously, this movie is a joke. Don't let your girlfriend convince you to watch it.",
    "Lifetime failed again. The plot was senseless, and the acting, especially by the teenagers, was terrible. This clichéd story has been done countless times. The previews promised a good thriller, but this movie was a letdown. Unless you have absolutely nothing else to do, avoid it at all costs. It was a waste of two hours. Frankly, scraping my face against a brick wall for two hours and soaking it in peroxide would have been more entertaining.",
    "I must admit that I am quite surprised by the high ratings this movie has received. In my view, the plot was rather nonsensical. The concept of the mother experiencing \"visions\" upon touching certain objects or people, and the continuation of a vision when she touches the same object twice, seemed exceedingly implausible. Additionally, I found DeeDee Pfeiffer's performance to be rather lacking, as her portrayal was quite grating. \n\nOn a positive note, the actress who played Lori delivered a commendable performance, and the supporting cast did well with the material provided to them. \n\nAlthough I typically enjoy content from LMN and maintain an open mind regarding various films, this particular movie struck me as having an absurd plot and exaggerated acting, which ultimately did not appeal to me.",
    "The original book was set in the 1950s, but for the TV series, it was changed to the 1930s style, as that is more appealing to viewers. Ironically, the tube train near the end was a 1950s train painted to look like a 1930s train, showing that even the Underground can play along with this aesthetic. The plot centered around the Jarrow March felt weak, although the 1950s version had students beginning to think about the world around them, making them contemplate the marchers' poverty is somewhat similar. The subplot about Japp having to cater for himself also felt weak, but it seemed like filler to extend the runtime. This story could have made a decent half-hour show, or they could have faithfully adapted the book for a longer and better episode. It's clear that this episode suffered from prioritizing style over content.",
    "The intrusive mouse and unwarranted lullaby were particularly jarring and irrelevant to the narrative. Such elements are reminiscent of amateur endeavors from my first year in film school, which is quite disheartening. Furthermore, the story appeared to languish without purpose, as numerous unrelated components were haphazardly included. This gives the impression that the creative team either lacked a coherent direction or the project could have benefited from a more concise runtime — a change that would have been advantageous rather than detrimental. Having recently viewed all the episodes up to this point over the past week, I must assert that this was undoubtedly the weakest installment. I advise others not to commence their viewing experience with this episode.",
    "I saw this film on opening weekend in Australia, excited by the strong cast of Heath Ledger, Joel Edgerton, Orlando Bloom, Naomi Watts, and Geoffrey Rush. I expected to see the definitive story of Ned Kelly. Unfortunately, despite an excellent performance by Heath Ledger in the lead role, the plot was very thin and did not inspire me to read \"Our Sunshine.\" \n\nThere were some positive aspects: Joel Edgerton's strong supporting performance, assured direction by Gregor Jordan (who showcased his talent in \"Buffalo Soldiers\"), and production design that captured the harshness of the Australian bush as it might have appeared to early 19th-century Irish immigrants. \n\nHowever, I feel that this film missed an opportunity to truly tell the story of an Australian folk hero (or was he?), possibly because it tried too hard to cater to Hollywood and sell well in the US. \n\nAt least the filmmakers didn't agree to remove the beards just to please Universal. \n\nI guess I'll have to stick with Peter Carey's excellent \"Secret History of the Kelly Gang.\" 4/10",
    "I attended the premiere in Melbourne.\n\nThe film is shallow, two-dimensional, and unengaging, which is surprising given the subject matter – it felt boring. The actors did a decent job, but they had little to work with due to the uninspired and lackluster script. For those concerned that Ned Kelly’s story might be overly intellectualized, rest assured, this version lacks any literary depth, presenting the tale superficially with stereotypical characters. However, it also fails as a casual, entertaining film; its pacing is uneven, and the execution is poor, making it unsatisfactory even as a basic action movie.\n\nI highly doubt that Gregor Jordan could genuinely believe that this was the best possible adaptation of the material.\n\nNed Kelly is a captivating figure, as is the national reaction to him. Whether seen as a folk hero, a class warrior, a psychopath, or a combination of these, he has been a significant part of Australian mythology for over 120 years. Unfortunately, once again, his story has been poorly represented on the big screen.\n\nSuch is life.",
    "Ned Kelly (Ledger), the notorious Australian outlaw and legendary figure, is often compared to a blend of Robin Hood and Billy the Kid. Australians cherish the tale of how he defied the English aristocracy, rallying the lower classes and leaving a lasting impact on the nation. However, this film conveniently overlooks that about 70% of those lower classes were immigrant criminals. Additionally, several so-called \"facts\" in the movie seem quite questionable upon reflection. \n\nIt should have been immediately apparent during the opening credits, which claimed the film was based on the book \"Our Sunshine,\" that this wouldn't be a historical epic but rather a romanticized adaptation of one of the many dubious Ned Kelly legends. Unfortunately, the result is nothing more than an exaggerated Hallmark channel-style \"real life historical drama\" wannabe. The narrative drags on alarmingly, evoking memories of Costner's lackluster \"Wyatt Earp.\" Essentially, nothing significant transpires in the film, and the journey to that nothingness feels interminable. This might have been more tolerable with strong performances (since the direction is certainly not praiseworthy), but unless the viewer is interested in exploring atrocious Irish accents, disappointment awaits.\n\nAdding to the dissatisfaction, the film devolves into a series of inane games: \"Who has the worst beard?\", \"Spot the obvious backstabber!\" (hint: they're all inexplicably redheaded), and \"Nature in Australia...including lions.\" Nature shots are gratuitously inserted, possibly in an attempt to appear artistic, stretching the runtime unnecessarily. Once all the native species have been showcased, a circus troupe conveniently appears, featuring a camel and a lion. The lion, inexplicably, is used in a fight scene designed to evoke more sympathy for the animal than for the slain humans.\n\nIn the end, this is a dry, unfeeling piece of historical fluff better suited for TV. The film lacks any redeeming qualities; even the usually outstanding Rush seems embarrassed to be involved. When a character remarks about having only two bullets left for him and his companion, it made me wish I had a gun to erase all memories of this film from my mind.",
    "They aimed for a fantasy blend of Man From Snowy River and Butch Cassidy, with a touch of romance featuring Ned and Joe with wealthy men's wives. There's a mix of Ned Kelly myths and facts, leaving room for artistic creativity. Unlike ancient legends, Kelly's story is relatively recent. I mistakenly thought the film would seriously portray Kelly's story like Peter Carey's novel. Instead, it fell short, and Mick Jagger's 1970 version might be closer to reality and better overall. Glad renting the DVD cost only two bucks. I'll give it 3/10, mainly for the nice Australian bush shots.",
    "This film is undoubtedly the worst piece of garbage I've seen in a while.\n\nHeath Ledger, considered a heartthrob, appeared deformed. Knowing he and Naomi Watts are a real-life couple would have saved me two excruciating hours wondering what she saw in him.\n\nOrlando Bloom as a heartthrob? With his scraggly beard and deer-in-the-headlights expression, I strongly disagree.\n\nRachel Griffiths delivered her usual fabulous performance, but Geoffrey Rush seemed eager to leave the set.\n\nShould I feel sorry for bank robbers and murderers? This film is a poor imitation of Butch Cassidy, which was genuinely entertaining. This production was trite, cliché-ridden, and boring. We only stayed because we hoped it would improve. It didn't.\n\nThe last 10-15 minutes were unintentionally hilarious. Heath and his gang, holed up in a frontier hotel, caused women and children to suffer. Though not inherently funny, their exit in armor reminded us of the Black Knight from Monty Python and the Holy Grail. We waited for them to say, \"I'll bite yer leg off!\" We and several other audience members were howling with laughter. Upon leaving, everyone agreed it was a waste of time.\n\nEven though I didn't pay cash to watch this disaster (sneak preview), it wasn't free. It cost me two hours of my life that I'll never get back.",
    "Were the term not devoid of geographical and semantic significance, one might aptly classify \"Ned Kelly\" as an \"Australian Western.\" For the inhabitants of Australasia, Ned Kelly stands as a folk hero, a bandit with a stature comparable to that of Robin Hood, Jesse James, Bonnie and Clyde, and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. As a progeny of Irish immigrants, Kelly turned into a fugitive and outlaw subsequent to a dubious accusation of shooting an Australian law officer—a transgression for which his innocent mother was unjustly incarcerated. In retribution for this maltreatment by the government, Kelly, alongside his brother Dan and two cohorts, embarked on a spree of notorious bank robberies. This defiance resonated deeply with many in the countryside, who perceived them as champions of justice in a milieu where Irish immigrants frequently endured contempt and discrimination at the hands of the ruling class.\n\nPerhaps due to our prior confrontations with the \"gentleman bandit\" archetype, \"Ned Kelly\" emanates a pervasive sense of familiarity and lacks originality, adhering slavishly to genre stereotypes and clichés en route to the anticipated climax. Ned epitomizes the archetypal, benevolent lawbreaker who resorts to lethal force only under duress and with profound remorse. He is also attuned to the plights of common folk, as evidenced by his act of returning a valuable watch to a bank robbery victim after one of his associates impetuously pilfered it—an act emblematic of the selective liberality that endears him to the masses. This selective benevolence earns him the clandestine admiration of those who revel in defying the establishment and the prevailing order. Geoffrey Rush personifies the archetypal, beleaguered law enforcer, personally invested in vanquishing the audacious upstart who persistently flouts authority. The narrative even indulges in the predictable trope of a lady held up during a robbery who, enamored by the romanticism and audacity of the criminal life, retreats to another room for an amorous encounter with one of the robbers. The film abounds with clichéd scenes such as this.\n\nHeath Ledger fails to enrapture in the titular role, offering scant depth to render his character either compelling or engaging. Compounding this deficiency is the imposition of a monotonous voice-over narration, which accentuates the sanctimoniousness and pretentiousness of both character and film.\n\nWhile \"Ned Kelly\" may serve a marginal didactic function as a chapter in Australian history, as a piece of entertainment, it is merely a redundant narrative delivered in different accents.",
    "This movie was so unbearably bad that I could hardly believe I was watching it. The directing, editing, production, and script all felt like they were done by junior high school students with little knowledge of filmmaking. There was no coherent narrative flow. Major emotional moments and climaxes, such as an early scene between Heath Ledger and Naomi Watts, and certain character relationships, appeared out of nowhere without proper setup, unlike what you'd expect in a well-crafted film. The characters were poorly developed, making it hard for us to connect with them. Surprisingly, the acting wasn't entirely bad, but the terrible writing overshadowed the relatively convincing performances. The film came across like a particularly bad TV western/epic, detracting from the fascinating true story it aimed to tell. I've read reviews claiming the film is important to Australians because of its subject matter. While Ned Kelly is certainly an important Australian historical figure, that doesn't make the movie good. A significant subject doesn't justify poor quality, as illustrated by \"Pearl Harbor,\" which, despite depicting an important event, was still a bad movie. Overall, this film is a complete failure, although Heath Ledger and Orlando Bloom are pleasant to look at.",
    "This movie didn't get a theatrical release in our area, so I was quick to rent it as soon as the DVD was available. In hindsight, I should have heeded the critics' advice and skipped it.\n\nEven though the cast was impressive, the movie turned out to be quite a letdown. It's clear why it was released straight to video.\n\nI had high hopes with actors like Bloom, Ledger, and Rush, all of whom have been fantastic in their previous works.\n\nHowever, the film was sluggish and failed to engage me. I couldn't connect with the characters and found myself tempted to fast-forward just to reach the conclusion.\n\nI can't recommend this film, not even for the sake of its attractive cast. It won't even meet those modest expectations.",
    "I was really excited to watch this movie, but it ended up being a letdown. I felt like the storytelling was pretty clunky and didn't draw me in as much as I had hoped. Heath Ledger and Orlando Bloom did a great job with their roles and added some charm to their characters, but overall, the movie felt forced and mechanical.\n\nThe start could have been way more engaging. Imagine if it kicked off with an intense shootout, then took us back to explain how everything led up to that moment. Instead, each scene felt predictable and cliché, kind of like watching a bad TV soap opera.\n\nHonestly, I was expecting much more from this film. The only silver lining is that it's slightly better than the Mick Jagger version, but not by a lot.",
    "\"Ned Kelly's story is significant to Australians, but this movie is terrible. It feels American, and though Ned was Australian, he has an Irish accent. It's the worst film I've seen in a while.\"",
    "From the outset, the film's political theme is overt and heavy-handed, rendering the plot entirely predictable. Good screenwriting, as any reputable textbook will advise, involves layering characters, incorporating character arcs, and adhering to a three-act structure—all elements conspicuously absent in this film. The portrayal of the police is one-dimensional, depicting them as shallow, incompetent, and cowardly antagonists. The filmmakers appear oblivious to the notion that police officers might be honorable citizens who view their service as a means to contribute positively to society.\n\nThe narrative offers no opportunity for viewers to independently assess whether Ned Kelly is a hero or a villain. The film begins with his arrest for horse theft, yet it provides no clarity on his guilt or innocence. We see him entering a jail, but only discover much later through dialogue that he has been incarcerated for three years.\n\nThe film features numerous shots of Ned staring solemnly into the camera, which, combined with the lack of engaging storytelling, makes it arduous to watch. This modern directorial approach has significantly diminished my interest in viewing similar films in the future.",
    "I was immediately drawn to this film due to the compelling narrative and the leading actor, prompting me to watch it. Directed by Gregor Jordan (Buffalo Soldiers), the film follows Ned Kelly (Heath Ledger), who, after being framed by the police with Superintendent Francis Hare (Geoffrey Rush) at the helm, is forced to evade capture. He forms a gang to fight back and clear his and his family's names. Although I did not give the film my undivided attention, this encapsulates the primary storyline. The cast includes Orlando Bloom as Joseph Byrne, Naomi Watts as Julia Cook, Laurence Kinlan as Dan Kelly, Philip Barantini as Steve Hart, Joel Edgerton as Aaron Sherritt, Kiri Paramore as Constable Fitzpatrick, Kerry Condon as Kate Kelly, Emily Browning as Grace Kelly, and Rachel Griffiths as Susan Scott. Heath Ledger delivers a solid performance, and the film features visually captivating sequences, particularly during a gun battle towards the conclusion. However, I cannot attest to fully enjoying the film due to my lack of complete attentiveness.",
    "I don't fully understand the rating I gave The Amati Girls. In hindsight, being kind enough to rate it 4 out of 10 was generous. What might have been a wonderful story with a relatively decent cast turned into a complete farce for me. The movie is riddled with clichés, the women's hair styles are dreadful, and most of the scenes feel unrealistic or fake. There's no genuine passion in this film; instead, it's filled with actors overacting to an unbearable degree. It's not funny enough to be a comedy and too fake-sad to be touching, making it simply not good in my opinion. I'm baffled how something like this ended up on my TV in Switzerland. Perhaps it lost something in translation? Who knows. It's definitely one of the strangest movies I've ever seen, and not in a good way. Sorry.",
    "This film was truly abysmal. The conclusion was utterly deplorable, and the narrative was conspicuously absent. The sole redeeming aspect of the production was the commendable acting by Robert DuVall and James Earl Jones, whose performances were nothing short of sublime. Regrettably, the film failed to honor their exceptional talents. Had the screenplay incorporated even a moderately engaging story, the film might have been worth viewing. Instead, the remarkable performances of DuVall and Jones were squandered on an egregiously poor storyline—or lack thereof.\n\nThroughout the duration of the film, I found myself anticipating an event that would somehow coalesce into a coherent plot, transforming mere dialogue into a substantive narrative. This anticipation proved futile as the dialogue consisted of unremarkable exchanges reflective of the period, offering nothing special in terms of character development. The only noteworthy element was Robert DuVall’s portrayal of a rambling, senile, inebriated old man.\n\nThe film’s climax offered no resolution of merit, leaving me in a state of disbelief; I had endured two hours in the hope of encountering a moment of intrigue or significance, only to be confronted with the rolling credits, signaling the end of a plotless and meaningless experience. The revelation that I had squandered two hours on what can scarcely be termed a movie was disheartening. The entirety of the narrative spanned merely a single day—the life (and death) of some Southerners on a plantation. One must question the narrative potential encompassed within a solitary day, Training Day notwithstanding.\n\nDespite the uniformly excellent acting performances of the cast, their talents were egregiously wasted on a profoundly disappointing film—if, indeed, it can be dignified with the term \"film.\"",
    "Oh man, this was the worst movie I've seen in ages. The acting was fine, but there was literally no plot. Seriously, no plot at all! Just a bunch of people jabbering about random stuff, and that's the whole movie. Ugh. Robert Duvall's character is all over the place, just asking the same questions repeatedly and getting the same answers. I'm pretty sure this film's rating is as high as a six because people feel like they should like it. Great acting from well-known and respected actors, but the movie itself is a complete mess. Actually, calling it a mess is too nice because at least a mess suggests something happened, and in this movie, NOTHING HAPPENS!",
    "\"S.W.I.N.G!\" holds historical significance as one of the few remaining Black-produced and acted films from the 1930s. Many similar films have deteriorated beyond viewability, but this one is relatively well-preserved. It offers a fascinating glimpse of the talented Black performers from the period following the Cotton Club's heyday—a largely forgotten era today.\n\nWhile the film is historically important and features some stellar performances, it is, unfortunately, a mess. The main plot mirrors those of Hollywood musicals from the same era, including a prima donna bent on sabotaging the show and an unexpected newcomer who saves the day. However, the writing is atrocious and occasionally trashy, projecting demeaning stereotypes of Black America. Before the plot fully develops, viewers endure scenes featuring a no-account bum living off his hardworking wife, a popular stereotype at the time. When he's caught with another woman—who wildly overacts— the ensuing fight resembles a WWE Smackdown scene, complete with threats of violence. Later, when the prima donna misbehaves, her husband punches her, and everyone applauds—a low point aimed at the lowest common denominator and poorly executed with some of the worst acting.\n\nDespite its numerous flaws in production, direction, and writing, the film is worth watching for its excellent singing and tap dancing, and for a glimpse into a forgotten facet of Black culture. Just be prepared for some truly terrible acting—you’ve been warned!",
    "Get ready to witness a unique twist of irony in \"The Sunshine Boys\"! Despite its title, this Neil Simon comedy delightfully subverts expectations with its unexpected lack of sunshine. Simon, whose brilliance shines through even without credit for the script adaptation from his play, humorously explores the quirks of old age. Walter Matthau's performance as a seasoned vaudeville performer reconnecting with his former comedy partner, played by the legendary George Burns, is a rollercoaster of laughs and surprises. Burns, who snagged a Supporting Oscar for his role, adds charm and wit as he joins the fray about thirty minutes in, setting the stage for comedic fireworks!\n\nThe film's hilarious chaos is directed by none other than Herbert Ross, who amps up the laugh factor despite the challenges of working with Simon's screenplay. The antics pile up in uproarious scenes, like Matthau's character auditioning for a TV commercial at a mechanic's garage, showcasing his talent for comedic delivery. Matthau brings such gusto to the role, making it impossible to watch without a grin! Although the character's exaggerated antics are a bit over-the-top, they contribute to the film's wild, unfettered energy. \n\n\"The Sunshine Boys\" may not burst with color, but it offers a spirited journey, setting up zany gags and delivering on the promise of relentless comedy. Sure, the film ambles at its own quirky pace, but that's part of its undeniable charm! Buckle up for a ride full of hilarity and memorable performances, guaranteed to keep you entertained from start to finish. **1/2 from ****!",
    "I absolutely adore Goldie Hawn and was thrilled to find another one of her films! So, when I spotted Protocol for just $5.50 at Walmart, I couldn’t resist snapping it up. While the film had its moments of fun, it just didn't quite take off like I hoped. Some scenes dragged a bit, like the excessively long bar party that didn't seem to add much.\n\nAnd then, there's the preachy scene at the end which, personally, left a sour note. It felt a bit out of place, and I'm not fond of comedies trying to deliver a moral lesson, especially in such a heavy-handed way.\n\nUltimately though, I'm happy to add another Goldie Hawn movie to my collection, even if it wasn’t quite the bargain I hoped it would be!",
    "\"Protocol\" is an entertaining film that showcases the delightful and charming Goldie Hawn, supported by a strong cast of supporting actors. The plot follows a quirky cocktail waitress who unexpectedly becomes a hero after saving an Arab dignitary's life. While the storyline loses some momentum midway through, Goldie's endearing performance keeps things enjoyable. It's definitely worth watching if you're a fan of Goldie Hawn.",
    "An executive producer in a movie is typically the individual responsible for securing the financial backing necessary to bring the film to fruition. In many films featuring Sean Connery, you’ll often see that he not only stars but also serves as the executive producer. This dual role indicates that Connery himself raised the funds, showcasing his significant influence in Hollywood. However, it's important to note that many movies starring Sean Connery were made purely because he managed to secure the financing. When the credits reveal that the executive producer and the lead actor are the same person, it often suggests that the film is primarily a vehicle for the star, with the story or screenplay potentially lacking in quality.\n\nFor instance, take the movie PROTOCOL, which chronicles the adventures of Sunny Davis, an eccentric cocktail waitress who becomes a top diplomat after saving a visiting dignitary. Despite the implausibility of the plot, the story progresses to even more far-fetched scenarios. Starring Goldie Hawn, who also served as the film's executive producer, PROTOCOL exemplifies the notion that when a film is driven by its star's influence, the script may fall short.",
    "The premise is implausible and fails to evoke much humor or engagement. However, Hawn's renowned charm manages to barely sustain the film. Goldie Hawn stands out as an actress who has achieved so much despite often working with subpar material.",
    "There are only two movies I would rate 1/10: this one and \"The Man Who Fell to Earth.\" I saw Protocol in a theater in the early '80s when I was in high school, and the script was an insult to anyone's (even a high school student's) intelligence. It completely lost me with the \"hilarious\" gag of someone getting shot in the butt. Goldie Hawn is supposed to be charming but comes off as vapid and moronic. The film also includes offensive Arab stereotypes and ends with Goldie winning everyone over by spouting populist nonsense. The acting was terrible, including Goldie Hawn's. I couldn't bear to watch another movie with her until she redeemed herself, in my opinion, in Everyone Says I Love You. This is the kind of movie you make if you want to put no effort into the screenplay. The worst.",
    "The only memorable aspect of this film was the scene featuring Goldie Hawn in her revealing French-cut bikini panties as she struggled playfully with a dozen other women attempting to remove her skimpy cotton top, all while giggling and teasing. This evocative moment, reminiscent of Nina Hartley's sensuality, stood out in the movie that came out when I was fourteen and left a lasting impression on me. I had tucked this scene away in the recesses of my mind until I recently saw it on television, where it was unfortunately censored. This reminded me of what an incredibly attractive woman Goldie Hawn was in the '80s, and I can only imagine the exciting life Kurt Russell must have had with her.",
    "I was thrilled to find El Mar, a Catalan-language film, at my art-house video store. However, my excitement waned after watching it.\n\nThe film is well-made and beautifully shot, with a convincingly acted but violently shocking opening sequence. The somewhat improbable burial scene in the town square is a minor detail. Initially, it feels like a non-magical Pan's Labyrinth set during the Spanish Civil War.\n\nFast-forward, the three children from the opening are now adults. Francisca is a nun at a tuberculosis sanatorium, and Manuel and Ramallo are patients. Coincidences happen, I suppose.\n\nThe main issue is the characters' bizarre and incoherent motivations and dialogue, especially compared to well-crafted films by directors like Almodovar. The movie spirals into excessive horror and gore, earning its \"potboiler\" label. Imagine a 40-year-old poster screaming: SEE FORBIDDEN LOVE!! RAPE!! MURDER!! MUTILATION!! FANATICISM!! ANIMAL CRUELTY!! BETRAYAL!!\n\nThe film needed more flashbacks to make the characters and relationships believable. Without them, it feels like a depressing mix of \"Brother Sun, Sister Moon\" and \"Pulp Fiction.\" If that's your thing, go ahead. I'll opt for something less grim.\n\nOn the language front, the Mallorquí dialect is indeed different from Barcelona's Catalan. Surprisingly, even Barcelonans reportedly needed subtitles to understand it.",
    "I was initially eager to watch a Catalonian film featured in Berlin's competition. However, following the screening, I felt utterly let down and angry. The movie was overloaded with gratuitous violence, stretched out for far too long, and juggled too many themes without purpose. Although the Spanish Civil War, much like any conflict, was horrific, this film's exploration of it, revenge, homosexual relationships, and Spain's skepticism towards Catholicism felt contrived. What Villaronga attempted to present as a pseudo-tragedy may be considered one of the worst in cinematic history. It’s disheartening to see Angela Molina involved in such a project. I strongly advise against watching this film under any circumstances.",
    "This film was a major letdown. The relentless cruelty and violence were very disturbing, with some scenes being unnecessarily ugly and mean-spirited. The main characters were difficult to identify or sympathize with, and the lead protagonist was particularly unlikeable. The exaggerated theatrics created a suffocating atmosphere, and the film offered little to no insight into the Spanish Civil War. Having visited Spain, I can confirm that this portrayal is far from realistic. Furthermore, the use of same-sex attraction as a \"horror\" element was offensive and poorly executed, despite the DVD being marketed to attract gay viewers. The actors appeared uncomfortable in their roles, seemingly trying to distance themselves from this chaotic production. If you have a taste for watching children and pets brutally killed, this film might especially appeal to you.",
    "This three-part horror film centers around a man in a boarded-up house, fervently warning viewers not to venture outside, presenting three tales as cautionary examples.\n\nThe first story features a young couple who, after a car accident, encounter two deranged individuals. Despite leading to predictable twists, the segment is engaging, fast-paced (about 15 minutes), violent, well-acted, and executed proficiently. It is enjoyable, even if foreseeable.\n\nThe second story follows a man fleeing after stealing a large sum of money. When his car breaks down, he is attacked by a dog and seeks refuge in a nearby clinic. This segment is notably slow-paced, overly long at 30 minutes, and marred by obvious plot developments. Nevertheless, it showcases good acting.\n\nThe third tale barely qualifies as horror, focusing on a beautiful, lonely woman in search of Mr. Right. It is visually appealing with stunning set designs and an erotic atmosphere, including a well-crafted sex scene. However, it remains predictable and lacks any true scares.\n\nThe film concludes on a disappointingly foolish note. Overall, the standout is the first segment, which is worth watching, but the rest of the film can be skipped.",
    "This road movie tries to come off as trendy and modern with its editing style and unusual camera angles, but it ends up being cheesy and dull, causing nothing but drowsiness.\n\nThe cast is underutilized, and the writing is both stupid and pretentious. The only redeeming aspects are the excellent soundtrack by Lalo Schifrin and the unique and interesting opening sequence.\n\nAvoid this film if you can; the negative reviews are well-deserved. It's truly awful. However, it might hold some charm as a movie you watch when you have nothing else to do, perhaps on a stormy day when you're completely bored.",
    "This film boasts some stunning shots, capturing the landscapes with an exquisite light that makes the cinematography its standout feature. \n\nHowever, it feels more like a made-for-TV movie. While the numerous plot twists keep it engaging, the absence of subtitles for key Spanish dialogues will leave non-Spanish speakers a bit lost.\n\nI received this movie as a Christmas gift because it's a family tradition to explore films starring actors we admire. Matthew McConaughey, who was brilliant in \"A Time to Kill\" and \"The Newton Boys,\" piqued my interest, prompting me to dive deeper into his filmography.\n\nDespite the DVD's marketing, which branded this a McConaughey film, his screen time is minimal and underwhelming. Die-hard fans might be disappointed, as his role feels more like an extra, lacking the charisma we've come to expect from him.\n\nOn the bright side, Patrick McGaw shines in his role. He's not only visually appealing but brings a sense of kindness and care to his character that’s reminiscent of a rom-com hero.\n\nFor a true showcase of McConaughey's talent, I'd recommend \"A Time to Kill,\" \"The Newton Boys,\" \"Frailty,\" \"How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days,\" \"Edtv,\" and \"Amistad.\" Steer clear of \"Larger Than Life\" and \"Angels in the Outfield\" unless you're entertaining kids, as these don't truly represent his abilities, though they are amusing for children.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Scorpion Spring\" isn't a bad film, but it doesn't quite steal the spotlight either.",
    "I have been searching for this film for an extended period due to its rarity, as it is one of the infamous \"video nasties.\" At the close of last year, I finally unearthed it on DVD. It is an exceptionally low-budget production. The narrative unfolds among Amazonian jungle tribes who live in constant dread of a demonic presence. Laura Crawford, a model working in South America, is abducted by a group of ruffians and taken deep into the jungle. There, she is held captive by a ludicrous native who self-identifies as \"The Devil.\" She endures a series of deplorable hardships until her captors are satisfied. Villagers chain maidens and the so-called devil grotesquely demonstrates the consumption of human flesh. Peter Weston, the \"devil hunter,\" ventures into the jungle with the mission to rescue her.",
    "As I near the end of my Video Nasties list, this gem appeared. Its premise involves a fashion model kidnapped and taken into the jungle by a ragtag group for ransom. A rescuer, equipped with a helicopter and pilot, is given money to negotiate, with a reward if he returns both the girl and the cash.\n\nThe pilot’s acting is abysmal, but they all are. Dubbing makes it unbearable. The jungle hides a cannibal cult whose “god” is a naked man with poor makeup and ping-pong ball eyes. His constant growling on the soundtrack drove me to mute the scenes.\n\nThe film is filled with almost constant nudity, likely its main reason for being banned. There's one gore scene, but it's not enough for fans. Jess Franco goes beyond the usual exploitation with explicit close-ups of both female and male genitals.\n\nI can't recommend this trash to anyone. It's not even entertainingly bad—just padded garbage. Only die-hard fans should bother, and even then, save it for last to avoid thinking this represents the entire list.",
    "Not sure if I'm addressing those who called this a video nasty or the director, but \"Devil Hunter\" is a bizarre 'horror' movie. \n\nThe plot loosely combines elements of \"Cannibal Ferox\" and \"Cut and Run.\" A woman is kidnapped in the 'jungle' by a 'tribe' of 'savages,' though the jungle looks like a Mexican park and the tribe resembles hippies in cheap Halloween costumes. The so-called savages are a diverse mix including white, Asian, black, and Hispanic individuals, as if Franco cast anyone who looked slightly ethnic.\n\nFurthermore, the film has minimal gore, no real scares, and excessive unnecessary nudity. It's not enjoyable. While I can usually find something to appreciate in sleazy Italian or Euro-trash films, this one fell way short.\n\n2 out of 10.",
    "This controversial video was originally banned in Britain but was finally permitted last November without any edits.\n\nThe film stars Ursula Buchfellner, Playboy's Playmate of the Month for October 1979. The beginning alternates between scenes of Buchfellner and misty jungle visuals, which seems pointless. Focusing on the bathtub scene would have been far more effective.\n\nIn the plot, Laura (played by Buchfellner) is kidnapped and held for ransom in the jungle. Peter (portrayed by Al Cliver, known from The Beyond and Zombie) is dispatched to locate her and the ransom. Naturally, one of the kidnappers (Antonio de Cabo) finds a way to occupy his time, while another (Werner Pochath) constantly complains.\n\nWhen the ransom exchange goes awry, Laura flees into the jungle. The question then becomes whether Peter can save her before the cannibals find her. Yes, there are cannibals in this jungle, which is why the video was labeled a \"nasty\"! Peter, along with his partner (Antonio Mayans from Angel of Death), discovers Muriel Montossé on the kidnappers' boat, where she is scantily clad. Peter leaves his partner and ventures alone to rescue Laura, now captured. They end up having sex, oblivious to the imminent danger.\n\nExpect scenes of blood, decapitation, guts, ample nudity, captivating writhing by a cannibal priestess (Aline Mess), and the memorable line, \"They tore her heart out,\" which turns out to be quite amusing when you watch it. Also, look out for an intense battle between Peter and a naked adversary (Burt Altman).",
    "Among Jess Franco’s three works listed on the controversial Official DPP Video Nasty list—namely Devil Hunter, Bloody Moon, and Women Behind Bars—this particular film is arguably the least notorious, primarily due to its sheer dullness. Set against the backdrop of an uninspiring jungle, it scratches the surface of horror with clumsy gore, a gratuitous rape scene, and excessive nudity that barely keep it afloat.\n\nGorgeous blonde Ursula Buchfellner takes the spotlight as movie star Laura Crawford, who finds herself kidnapped by a gang of ruthless criminals and whisked off to a remote tropical island. The island is inhabited by a savage tribe that worships the 'devil god' lurking in the jungle—a menacing figure devoted to devouring the hearts of nubile female sacrifices.\n\nTasked by Laura’s agent with delivering a $6 million ransom, brave mercenary Peter Weston, played by Al Cliver, and his Vietnam vet pilot buddy navigate to the island, only to face treachery when the kidnappers attempt a double-cross. Amid the chaos, Laura manages to escape into the jungle but unfortunately falls into the hands of the island’s natives, who promptly offer her to their fearsome deity.\n\nFranco directs this laughable escapade with his signature lackluster approach, infusing it with all his notorious clichés: poorly executed gore, murky cinematography, unsteady zooms, gratuitous crotch shots, blurry imagery, cringe-worthy sound effects, and clumsy editing. The end result is a woeful mess that is excruciating to endure from start to finish. (I had to spread it out over multiple sittings.) Even the frequent views of the stunning Buchfellner in her full natural splendor aren't tempting enough to make me revisit this dire film anytime soon.",
    "How can you recognize a dreadful horror movie? When it has you laughing hysterically, naturally! The plot has been extensively reviewed by others, so I'll focus on the sheer comedic elements.<br /><br />\n\nSome reviews place the setting in South America, others in Africa; personally, I thought it was somewhere on an obscure island in the Pacific. The exact location remains a mystery. The cannibal tribe is an eclectic mix of a few Black women, some Black men, and a drummer who eerily resembles a young Frank Zappa. The Devil God is depicted as a large Black man suffering from an intense case of pink eye.<br /><br />\n\nOne of the most \"bizarre\" scenes in the movie features \"Pablito\" discovering his partner hanging from a tree, drenched in what seems like an orange substance—presumably blood. He screams for an inordinately long time (which I found hilarious), and then his partner's head falls to the ground. \"Pablito\" gives it a slight kick, seemingly for the fun of it, and astonishingly, the eyes still move...<br /><br />\n\nBut any \"creepiness\" dissipates when you realize the eye movement is just another sign of the film’s poor quality...<br /><br />\n\nI haven't laughed this much in ages. I highly recommend this movie for a lazy Sunday afternoon with friends. Grab some beers and enjoy the absurdity! However, if you're after genuine horror or gore, this film isn't worth your time.",
    "An actress filming in Africa gets kidnapped and taken deep into the jungle, where she's held for ransom. Desperate to rescue her, the producer hires someone to bring her back. To make matters worse, the jungle is inhabited by cannibals who worship a grotesque \"god\" with a penchant for consuming naked women.\n\nThis film is a gruesome and trashy spectacle, filled with extensive nudity and graphic violence, including against unclothed individuals. It's an exploitation movie meant to appeal to our darkest instincts. However, despite the bloodshed, explicit scenes, and the hideous creature, the film is terribly dull. The pacing is erratic, making it hard to watch. Multiple plot threads appear disconnected, even though they all converge into a single story. Most frustrating is the lack of dialogue, with minimal lines that revolve around cruelty or a character's defiance insisting, \"I'll do what I want.\" The movie is so silent and uninteresting that if it weren't for the victims' frequent screams, I'd recommend it as a sleep aid.\n\nAvoid this movie unless you're looking for a way to fall asleep or are an aficionado of Euro-cannibal films.\n\n(Note: VideoAsia recently released this as part of their Terror Tales series. The print is oddly letter-boxed, likely sourced from a Japanese version with censoring, and lacks opening titles.)",
    "If you've been waiting to see Al Cliver wrestle a naked, 7ft tall black man into a full nelson, your film is here! Laura Crawford (Ursula Buchfellner) is kidnapped by a group demanding a $6 million ransom delivered to their island hideout. Unexpectedly, rugged Vietnam vet Peter Weston (Cliver) is hired by a film producer to rescue her. They also didn't anticipate a local tribe that sacrifices young women to their monster cannibal god with bug eyes.\n\nSimilar to CANNIBALS, this film is more entertaining, thanks to a hilarious dub track and a goofy monster with bulging eyes (Franco confirms they were split ping pong balls in the disc's interview). Franco assembles a strong EuroCult supporting cast including Gisela Hahn (CONTAMINATION) and Werner Pochath (whose death scene is baffling, showing a close-up of someone not him pretending to be him). The film includes plenty of nudity and gore (of the Tempra paint variety). The highlight is the world's slowest fistfight between Cliver and Antonio de Cabo in the waves. Unfortunately, Jess stretches this one out to a painful 1 hour and 40 minutes when it should have been 80 minutes tops.\n\nThe Severin DVD mostly looks good but has some odd ghosting during dark scenes. Also, one long section of dialog is in Spanish without subtitles (subs are only available for the French track). Franco provides a nice 16-minute interview about the film, speaking more kindly about Buchfellner than his CANNIBALS star Sabrina Siani.",
    "\"Devil Hunter\" gained notoriety for being on the DPP 'Video Nasty' list, but it didn't deserve the ban. While the plot about a kidnapped actress and a hunter in the Amazon jungle offers a decent base, the movie lacks engaging scenes and drags for eighty-five minutes. Director Jess Franco has talent, as shown in his other works, but this film is not one of his best. If not for the 'Video Nasty' list, many, including myself, would not have watched it. Unless you're aiming to see every film on that list, there's no reason to bother with this one.",
    "This film felt excessively long, despite being just 75 minutes. The challenge with jungle horror movies is that they often include too many scenes of characters walking through various landscapes (such as jungles, rocky cliffs, or near bodies of water) to extend the running time. However, the movie is worth watching for its amusing and unclothed native zombie, characterized by large, bulging, bloody eyes and accompanied by a heavily reverberated soundtrack of heavy breathing. Eurotrash enthusiasts will find ample entertainment in the poor English dubbing, gratuitous female nudity, and the comically exaggerated makeup on the monster and native extras. Though it's a zombie/cannibal film, the gore was relatively mild, possibly because I didn't see an uncensored version.",
    "This is a poorly made, low-budget movie with terrible acting and a stupid plot. A mystic man who eats women? Ridiculous! If you have nothing better to do, like sleeping, go ahead and watch it.",
    "This is the worst TMNT franchise entry. Even as a kid, I thought it was bad despite liking the original cartoon. A memorable scene has a mafia ape explaining rhetorical questions, which is terrible. While many fans disliked the inclusion of a female turtle, it didn't bother me; she was so forgettable I had to be reminded of her. Overall, the show is miserably forgettable, with the theme song being the only decent part, serving as a guilty pleasure.",
    "This portrayal is the greatest disservice to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles ever. Fortunately, Venus is not part of the official TMNT canon. The introduction of a female turtle undermines the poignant story of four unique male mutants who lack the prospect of having a family, emphasizing their irreplaceable bond. The crossover with the Power Rangers was a disastrous mistake; the voices were off, and the characters behaved inconsistently. A better approach would have included improved designs, animatronics, and no Venus.\n\nAvoid this at all costs—it's cringe-worthy material. The lip synchronization was slow and unnatural, and Shredder was completely disrespected. The main villain, some Dragonlord character, was laughably bad. The turtles were cluttered with unnecessary accessories, like the strange band around Raph's thigh, and had poorly designed, sculpted plastrons.\n\nIf the turtles had their original look, stayed true to their characters, excluded Venus, eliminated the juvenile sound effects, and had a better-written script, this could have been a successful venture.",
    "I have disliked the idea of a female turtle since 1987. The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (TMNT) have always been four brothers, trained by their teacher Splinter, battling their enemies. Each brother is named after a great artist: Leonardo, Michelangelo, Raphael, and Donatello. Introducing Venus, a female turtle, seems pointless and adds nothing significant to the story. I believe the original TMNT series from 1987 was superior. While adding new enemies in each installment keeps the story exciting, introducing a female turtle feels unnecessary and weak. We hope to see more of the TMNT series with the same characters we knew and loved from 1987, without the addition of a female turtle.",
    "This film is terrible. You don’t need to read any further if you are thinking about watching it – just don't (unless you want a lesson in how not to make a movie).\n\nThe acting is awful and feels very amateurish. I was surprised to see that they actually got Michael Madsen, but even he didn't do well.\n\nThe plot is terrible. If anyone says it’s original or good, they probably haven’t seen a decent movie before. Even compared to other Hollywood action movies, this one is really bad.\n\nDon't watch it! Go for a jog instead – at least you won’t regret it.",
    "Absolutely dreadful movie. Enough said.\n\nI can't believe I have to elaborate on this. The film was atrocious. It's frustrating having to waste time on this, but I feel obligated to warn others. Steer clear of this film. The acting is abysmal, and the writing is downright idiotic. Every aspect of it is terrible. The only redeeming quality might have been Deniz Akkaya, but even that was marred by a gratuitous and unnecessary rape scene. The movie is a poorly executed and utterly unbelievable mess of nonsense.\n\nAnd another thing, IMDb's rule requiring a minimum of 10 lines of text for reviews is infuriating. First, I endure this garbage film. Then, in an effort to help others, I sign up with IMDb only to find that I need to write a full-blown essay to convey how bad it is. Completely ridiculous.",
    "Assuming this won't be relegated to a straight-to-video release, I highly recommend avoiding this title at all costs – unless you're tired of quality, well-executed films. I watched this last night at AFI Dallas and walked out with 20 minutes left simply because I no longer cared about the plot (not out of disrespect to the director... that would be awkward). When you can catch a continuity error just 5 minutes into the movie—a shot-out, shattered window before any shots are fired, and then the window breaks with the first shot—you know things are headed downhill. Unfortunately, this blunder is just a preview of what's to come.\n\nSpare you the details, but the movie is sub-par in every aspect. Even Michael Madsen's performance was disappointing, which says something when you're only expecting half-hearted acting from him. And the rape scene... My goodness! The line \"Shut up and take it\" should never be used in a rape scene. EVER.\n\n3/10",
    "Sometimes, a movie is so overwhelmingly bad that it can actually lower your spirits. You start to wonder why our standards for entertainment have fallen so low. Do filmmakers really expect us to sit through an endless barrage of clichés and still be entertained?\n\nHollywood often makes a gun the central focus, driving the plot and conflict. It’s the same tired routine: A character needs a gun, gets a gun, can’t do something because of the gun, puts the gun down first, and then panic ensues because someone else has a gun. The character waves the gun around menacingly for 90 minutes, leading to a predictable climax marked by the sound of police sirens.\n\nFor this overused formula to work, a film has to be exceptionally clever and well-executed. Unfortunately, this movie is neither. It lacks life and personality and will drain these from you as well. It will make you feel worse about the world we live in. Who needs that? Honestly, this might be the worst film I've ever seen. Everyone involved in creating this soul-crushing disaster should be ashamed for contributing to such a disservice.",
    "Congratulations to whoever approved this. Edward Furlong, you're not as great as you think. You can't just grab any low-budget, amateur project with the sole aim of making money.\n\nThe filming quality is terrible. Honestly, anyone with a camera could achieve the same result, if not better.\n\nAs for the acting, let's just say you won't find top-notch actors at the supermarket. The good ones usually have a degree or at least some significant experience! The director, Jon Keeyes, you really need to find a new purpose in life because directing is not your forte. Your directing is poor, the angles are confusing (and not in a good way), the lines sound like they're being read off toilet paper, and the music comes in at all the wrong times and fades out for no reason. Also, avoid writing – making movies requires a certain artistry and skill, which, frankly, you lack.\n\nInstead of trying to create a badass shootout movie, this project should have been scrapped from the beginning. Perhaps try working at a coffee shop instead; it would reduce your stress and save moviegoers both their money and a disappointing night.\n\nVote: 1/10 (my first one)",
    "I rented this DVD without any prior knowledge. I was initially skeptical seeing Michael Madsen in a film I'd never heard of, but since it was free, I decided to give it a try.\n\nIn hindsight, Mr. Blonde would probably prefer to forget his involvement in such a regrettable film.\n\nIt turns out that a bad script and dialogues can't be saved, even by good actors. Add to that a slew of amateur performers trying to play native English speakers but failing to deliver lines that should have never made it to the screen. The dialogue is astonishingly unconvincing. The music is terrible and completely mismatched, giving the whole production a feel of a poorly executed school play.\n\nI suggest watching it only to appreciate other, better movies. This is the reason I gave it a 3, rather than the 1 it truly deserves.",
    "I saw a DVD at a friend’s house and assumed it was a Turkish action movie with minor Hollywood actors. Intrigued, I decided to watch it later. It was tough to bear. When the credits rolled, I thought, \"We Turks really suck at Hollywood-style filmmaking.\" But then I realized it wasn’t Turkish; it was American, directed and produced by Americans.\n\nThat made me wonder: How did they get actors like Michael Madsen, Edward Furlong, or Arnold Vosloo to participate? Probably with money. And where did they get such money? By using the cheapest equipment and crew available. If the budget was still tight, they likely wrote and directed it themselves.\n\nSo, despite what others might say, this isn't a bad movie. It made me think and even meditate, which many films fail to do. It leaves you in disbelief and makes you wonder again.",
    "What was with all the Turkish actors? No offense, but their involvement seemed pointless. The film completely squandered their talent. There was no script to challenge their acting skills, requiring almost nothing from them. I bought this film to see Michael Madsen, one of my favorite actors, but sadly, this film was yet another misfire for him. The script was terrible with nothing substantial for the characters to engage with, making them all two-dimensional. Madsen attempted to portray a tough guy, but the poor script and weak direction restricted him from adding depth or interest to his character.\n\nThe gunfight at the beginning of the film was equally disappointing. The sound effects were bizarre, more like paintball gun noises during a skirmish than actual gunfire. Even video games have better sound effects. And then there was this really annoying guy at the start, part of the robbery gang, whining in a nasal American voice with lines like \"Let's get the F#$k out of here\" and \"What are we going to do, man?\" He sounded like a girl. On the upside, it was funny enough to make me laugh for a few seconds. Whoo Hoo! What a dumb film. Poor Madsen, but he'll bounce back.",
    "This film was a major letdown. Initially, I skimmed the plot summary, and it seemed decent enough, so I decided to give it a try. However, the acting was abysmal. The actors appeared uncomfortable in front of the camera, making everything look incredibly fake. I feel particularly sorry for Edward Furlong, especially since Terminator 2 was my favorite movie a few years ago, and I've watched it at least 20 times.\n\nThe plot was equally disappointing; I suspect the writers were exhausted when penning the script. \n\nOn the bright side, it's the kind of bad movie that's almost entertaining because it’s so dreadful. You find yourself watching just to see how much worse it can get, providing you with plenty of incredulous stories to share later about how awful it was.\n\nIn a way, I recommend everyone watch this, if only to better appreciate other, more genuine films.",
    "I'm a huge fan of Arnold Vosloo! Seeing him finally take the spotlight in a recent movie, rather than just playing a bit part, filled me with excitement.\n\nTrue, my background in film appreciation means I noticed a few things: the film's setting in an abandoned part of town felt too quiet without the usual traffic and curious onlookers.\n\nWhile the acting overall had its flaws, Arnold Vosloo's brilliance was undeniable. I chalk up the shortcomings to poor direction and an unimpressive supporting cast.\n\nArnold Vosloo absolutely made the film worth watching. Without him, I'd have dismissed it as just another mediocre movie.\n\nThe rape scene was disturbingly brutal and felt unnecessary, but the escape scenes at the end were well-acted, despite the lackluster shoot-out sound effects. There were some continuity errors, but those are forgivable in a film of this caliber.\n\nAll in all, I enjoyed the movie because Arnold Vosloo truly shined!\n\nJackie",
    "This art film was made either in 1969 or 1972 (the National Film Preservation Foundation says 1969, but IMDb says 1972). Regardless of the exact year, it definitely has that late 60s-early 70s vibe, with the distinctive camera work and pop art styles you'd expect from that era.\n\nThe movie is basically three simple images that get distorted with various quirky camera tricks. There's music playing in the background, but no dialogue or story. It's clearly meant to be some kind of performance art. Like most performance art, it's intriguing at first but gets old pretty fast. To be blunt, it's quite boring and probably only interesting to the filmmakers themselves, their family and friends, and maybe a few people who think they're too cool for mainstream tastes.",
    "Nine minutes of mesmerizing, pulsating, and intricately symmetric abstract images create a mind-bending experience that borders on the surreal. At the beginning, a full-frame eye captivates your attention, and later, silhouetted birds against vibrant backdrops add to the visual intrigue. While it wasn't my cup of tea, there's no denying its intensity—it felt about 8½ minutes too long for my taste.",
    "\"Loaded\" is a film that features a highly attractive cast, which arguably stands as its most appealing aspect. This alone might make it worth watching for some viewers.\n\nThe movie narrates the journey of Tristan Price (played by Jesse Metcalfe), an aspiring young man from a well-off family, poised to begin law school. Despite the facade of perfection, his family life is fraught with high expectations and limited affection. His father exerts a tight grip on his activities, permitting him to leave the house primarily for educational purposes. This overprotectiveness stems from a past family trauma, hinted at through flashbacks and fully unveiled only at the movie's conclusion. Feeling stifled, Tristan seizes the first opportunity to break free when his friends take him to a strip club to celebrate his graduation. The night escalates to a beach house party where Tristan meets Sebastian Cole (Corey Large), who introduces him to the world of drug dealing.\n\nDespite its technical competence, the film is marred by a weak script and a lackluster storyline. The director's use of various camera effects, such as slow-motion, fast-motion, freeze-frames, and echoes, tends to feel misplaced and distracting. While these techniques are typically employed to depict a character's altered state due to drug use, their random and sporadic application in this film appears to be a misguided attempt at stylistic flair.\n\nThe performances are generally commendable, even though the cast comprises relatively unknown actors. Corey Large, in particular, delivers a notable portrayal of the main antagonist. It is likely that some of these actors will progress to more prominent roles in the future.\n\nFrom an aesthetic standpoint, the film scores high. The actresses are exceptionally attractive and nearly divert attention from the film's otherwise tedious content. Although the male characters' attractiveness is implied, further opinions would be needed for a comprehensive assessment.\n\nIn sum, \"Loaded\" fails to deliver a compelling cinematic experience. It does not merit a purchase, rental, or even a free viewing, as the effort to sit through it outweighs the sparse enjoyment it offers.",
    "This is it. This is the one. This is the worst movie ever made. It surpasses all others in its awfulness. I've never seen anything worse. Just retire the trophy and give it to these filmmakers—there's simply no comparison.\n\nEven three days after watching this (for reasons I still don't understand), I cannot believe how incredibly horrible this movie is. It's so terrible that it doesn't even resemble a movie or a story and should never have been brought into existence.\n\nThis film made me question whether humanity is truly meant to do good. It left me feeling disgusted with our progress as a species. This kind of movie actually harms our society. We should be ashamed. Our global responsibility as creators of art is to prevent such gross distortions of our reality for our own good. It's an embarrassment. I can't fathom how the actors, writers, or the director can sleep at night knowing they contributed to making \"Loaded.\" I don't understand what kind of people enjoy watching these types of films.\n\nThat being said, I enjoy a good \"bad\" movie. I love \"Shark Attack 3\" and \"Bad Taste\" because they're hilariously bad. I recommend them to all my friends because they're amusingly awful.\n\nBut this... this crosses the line into a different realm of bad. It's awkward bad. It's the kind of bad where you can predict every line, action, death, and sequence well in advance—often only five minutes into the film.\n\nEvery cheesy editing \"effect\" is used repeatedly to a nauseating degree. I never want to see the \"shaky\" camera \"drug buzz rush\" effect, jump cuts, swerve cuts, or any other fancy cut ever again. It's monotonously boring, repetitive, and tortures the audience.\n\nThe most DISTURBING thing about this movie is that a considerable amount of money seems to have been invested in this garbage. If I ever see the director, I will demand he go home and reconsider his life choices, or I'll do it for him.\n\nIf we ever needed a new form of inhumane torture for war prisoners, just keep showing them this movie in a padded cell repeatedly. Trust me, they might start devising more elaborate ways to escape after the 72nd viewing.\n\nThese movies are the most vile aspects of our society. Please. Stop. NOW.",
    "Sometimes, after watching a film, you wish you could get a refund for the time you wasted. This was one of those moments. I almost quit with only 15 minutes left and now, I wish I had.\n\nThe main character’s transformation from a disciplined, controlled life to one of total irresponsibility happens absurdly fast.\n\nFrom a graduation party to the predictable ending, Tristan Price (Jesse Metcalfe), a man of privilege and refinement, lets himself be led astray by a seductive woman, violence, and mind-altering substances. While it’s understandable he’d be tempted by the alluring April (Nathalie Kelley), his quick descent into drugs, violence, and loyalty to someone he just met is baffling.\n\nHonestly, aside from the chance to admire Nathalie Kelley and Monica Keena, this film offers nothing worthwhile. Save your money and your time... do something else instead.",
    "Weak plot, predictable violence, and only semi-interesting characters. It feels like the writer, who also stars, was fictionalizing his own mistakes and added incredible fantasies of drugs and murder to make it \"hot.\" The rap and house soundtrack is predictable, the family conflicts are poorly acted and stereotypical, and overall, the movie is terribly boring. Even the title is unoriginal; IMDb lists five movies with the same name released in 2007-2008. I watched it on Showtime, which listed the synopsis for a different movie. I was halfway through before realizing there was no undercover cop. Even though it's another stereotype, it would have made it more interesting.",
    "All I could think about while watching this movie was how mediocre it was. People often mention that its strength lies in its realistic depiction of drug effects and the downward spiral individuals can experience. However, the film's techniques were overused, making them unconvincing and irrelevant to the overall story.\n\nThe plot was dull, unimaginative, unbelievable, and confusing. Most reviews of this film echo the same sentiment.\n\nAlthough some of the actors and actresses are attractive, good looks can't save a film with such boring action. The action scenes were sparse and uninspiring: just a few punches here and there, and a final shootout at the end. Nothing special.\n\nAs others have noted, “bad” movies can be enjoyable because of their flaws. This film, however, is just empty and unremarkable.\n\nIf you need an educational movie to deter drug use, I highly recommend other films that tackle this topic more effectively, such as \"Requiem For A Dream,\" \"Trainspotting,\" \"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,\" and \"Candy.\" For a lighter take, try \"Go\" or \"Half Baked.\"\n\nLastly, the one potentially memorable line in this movie, delivered by Vinnie Jones, was taken from \"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.\" It's disappointing to see a piece of that great film tarnished by this one.\n\nOverall, save your money and time by NOT watching this movie.",
    "According to Corey Large's IMDb information, there is a movie titled \"Reload\" in production (as of June 2008) in which he plays a character named Sebastian Cole.\n\nFirstly, how does such a poorly received movie get a sequel? Secondly, didn’t Sebastian Cole die at the end of \"Loaded\"?\n\nI watched \"Loaded\" in the early hours while struggling with insomnia, so I was drifting in and out during the film. I probably missed some plot points, but overall, it seemed quite weak. In my opinion, Large's performance was one of the stronger aspects of the movie. I'm also surprised at the comments about the beautiful girls, as I found the actress playing Brooke to be pretty, but not exceptional.",
    "This film had a lot of potential and a relatively interesting plot, but it was seriously let down by the actors, director, and editors.\n\nI feel bad for the writers, as it could have been good. The acting is wooden, and very few of the characters are believable.\n\nThe editor clearly wanted to showcase new techniques, resulting in numerous quick, flashy edits in almost every scene. These were presumably meant to be symbolic but ended up merely being annoying.\n\nI wanted to like this film and hoped for a satisfying resolution to the plot's imbalance, but unfortunately, it left me feeling like I had wasted my time and that the filmmakers had wasted their money.",
    "This film is one of the most poorly executed I've ever seen. It attempts to mimic virtually every type of thriller, but ultimately makes a mess of them all.\n\nThere isn’t a single redeeming line or character to be found. The plot, if it exists, appears to be an afterthought, and the acting is so subpar that it’s best left unmentioned. I genuinely cannot comprehend how such a poorly made film gets produced and released. Does no one at any stage of production think, 'This is truly terrible,' and decide to halt the project?\n\nIt's movies like this that drive people to consider illegal downloads. The trailer is misleading, presenting a completely different film. At least when you download it, you haven't wasted your time or money. Do yourself a favor and skip this one; it’s truly painful to watch.",
    "Acting: 6/10 – Some good performances, but generally not great.\nDirection: 4/10 – Poor decisions throughout the film.\nWriting: 2/10 – The story is nonsensical with many flaws.\nOverall: 4/10 – Not worth your time.\n\nThe characters are overly exaggerated and unrealistic. The plot contains inexplicable elements that detract from the story. The film's overuse of special effects and stylistic choices, such as slow motion, camera shakes, and fast forwards, becomes tiresome after 30 minutes. Additionally, the excessive use of music, nearly equal to the dialogue in the first hour, disrupts the flow.",
    "This movie didn't quite hit the mark for me, but I appreciate that there are worse films out there. In the Gangster/Drug scene genre, it's tough to pull off a convincing storyline. Unfortunately, this film struggles in that area. Sebastian's motives, for example, feel a bit far-fetched and cliché. \n\nA believable set of character relationships is also important, and this movie falls short there too. While Tristan's separation from his family is interesting, the reasons behind it are a bit unclear. It raises some fascinating questions about rebellious behavior in upper-class families, but doesn't explore them as much as it could have. \n\nThere was potential for a solid socially critical drama, but the movie focuses more on flashy production techniques and special effects. This leaves little room for the characters to reflect and for the story to develop naturally. \n\nThe film tries to be a drama that doesn't glorify substance abuse and violence, which is commendable. However, it ends up feeling more like an average action movie with a decent cast. Vinnie Jones does a good job in his usual role, and the editing is pretty decent too.\n\nOverall, I just can't recommend it. 1 star for Vinnie and 2 stars for the editing.",
    "From the beginning of the movie, it feels like the director is trying to convey something. Instead of letting the story shape the style of the film, he seems to have chosen a particular style first and then crafted a story to fit it. Unfortunately, he has failed miserably in this approach. I suppose he was aiming to create a stylish movie. In any case, I believe this film is a complete waste of time and effort. To give the director some credit, he is knowledgeable about the medium he is working with; I have seen worse movies than this. At least he manages to maintain continuity throughout the film, and the actors deliver decent performances.",
    "I skimmed through the movie just enough to grasp the plot, but to be honest, I found it quite boring and, at times, confusing. The main reason I watched it was to see CHACE CRAWFORD, who is undeniably attractive, although his hair looked a bit odd in this film. Still, he was hot.\n\nDespite CHACE’s undeniable appeal, it wasn’t enough to redeem the movie for me. The plot wasn’t terrible, but the excessive cussing in nearly every sentence was off-putting. Is it really that hard to express anger without constantly using the F-word? The frequent cussing and the flashy, shaky camera work gave me a headache.\n\nOverall, although the plot was passable, I found the film tedious and overly dramatic. That’s why I only watched the scenes with CHACE in them. LOL! Anyway, I wouldn't recommend renting it unless you're a die-hard fan of one of the cast members, like I was. Oh, and the cast was definitely attractive. The girls were HOT, but CHACE IS THE BEST!!",
    "In this imaginative horror film, Vincent Price stars as a crazed magician who discovers that his unique skills have been sold off to someone else. In a bid to get revenge on those who wronged him, he devises an elaborate plan that ultimately backfires.\n\nAlthough Price's performance is slightly below his usual brilliance, he remains the primary reason to watch this suspenseful tale. The supporting cast features Patrick O'Neal, Mary Murphy, Eva Gabor, and Jay Novello.",
    "Had I not read Pat Barker's 'Union Street' before seeing the film adaptation, I might have enjoyed it. Sadly, that wasn't the case. While the film was well-made and aligned with my tastes, it failed miserably as an adaptation.\n\nThe novel's harrowing depiction of life in a northern England working-class area was deeply moving, gripping me with its raw portrayal of the women's lives. It was an emotional rollercoaster of tears, repulsion, shock, anger, sympathy, and misery. Despite its bleakness, I couldn't put it down.\n\nThe film, however, was a letdown. Hollywood glossed over Barker's stark realism with a sugary layer of hope and romance. While it featured inspiring music and excellent performances, it didn't do justice to 'Union Street'.\n\nKey characters were condensed into a single role played by Jane Fonda, and many important stories were sidelined. I understand the challenges of adapting such sensitive, horrific content for a broad audience and the impracticality of a film with multiple main characters. However, the essence of the novel was lost. The darkness, the rain, the broken windows, and the stench of poverty were replaced with sunshine, pretty houses, and a whimsical score by John Williams.\n\nIf you enjoyed the film's optimistic take on 'reality', prepare yourself for a much grimmer experience with the book—think 'Schindler's List', but without the hopeful ending.",
    "I saw a brief review that mentioned \"great acting,\" but I strongly disagree. In my opinion, these are two talented actors delivering terrible performances with absolutely no chemistry. They are working for a renowned director who, unfortunately, has produced his worst effort to date. Robert De Niro's portrayal is bafflingly contradictory, while Jane Fonda's performance is erratic, likely due to the poorly written character she has to work with. The film's pacing is painfully slow, and despite its goal of being an uplifting story about overcoming illiteracy, watching it is nothing short of a downer. I rate it 1 out of 10, easily one of the worst high-budget films I've ever seen.",
    "Robert DeNiro portrays an incredibly intelligent yet illiterate character in an unremarkable film. The movie squanders outstanding talent to a frustrating degree. The script and dialogue are implausible, and Jane Fonda's role is an unamusing caricature of herself. The film drags on, is poorly shot, and comes off as excessively preachy while relying heavily on common clichés. Though Swoosie Kurtz shines in a supporting role, it hardly redeems the film.<br /><br />Additionally, the new IMDB rule requiring ten lines per review is irritating. When a film is this lacking in value, it doesn’t necessitate ten lines to inform others to steer clear. Save your time and skip this movie.",
    "This is the story of a man with unusual feelings for a pig. It begins with an opening scene that brilliantly showcases absurd comedy. A formal orchestra audience is transformed into a chaotic, violent mob by the bizarre chants of its singers. Unfortunately, the film remains absurd throughout, lacking a coherent narrative, which eventually becomes too off-putting. Even audiences from that era are likely to be turned off. The cryptic dialogue makes Shakespeare seem easy for a third grader. However, on a technical level, it exceeds expectations with impressive cinematography by future great Vilmos Zsigmond. Brief appearances by future stars Sally Kirkland and Frederic Forrest can also be seen.",
    "Oh, Bait. How much do I hate you? Let me list the ways. \n1. You try to be funny, but you're just corny and not enjoyable; every joke is predictable and doesn't make me laugh. Instead, I feel like throwing up.\n2. You try to be dramatic, but you're not believable; the woman overacts terribly, and the \"bad guy\" looks like Bill Gates and is about as scary as Bill Gates. Imagine Bill Gates trying to scare someone with a gun. It doesn't work. Jamie Foxx's dramatic scenes are ridiculous and make me want to throw up.\n3. You try to be action-packed but are dull and dragging. When the action heats up, the camera is shaky like in The Blair Witch Project, making me nauseous and wanting to throw up.\n4. You try to be a good movie, but you failed, FAILED, FAILED! I'd rather walk barefoot through the Sahara with no water, sunscreen, and only Meryl Streep for company than watch another minute of this movie with overacting and a badly written story.\n\nJust promise me I'll never have to watch a movie this bad again.",
    "The movie, despite its promising premise, falls flat. Although I'm a Takashi Miike fan, I consider this work, along with DOA 2 and 3, to be among his lesser achievements. Some viewers seem to give it a pass solely because it's a Miike film, but for many of us, the kid's endless screaming, slow pace, and lackluster acting are major drawbacks.\n\nFans of Miike might watch it out of curiosity, but they'll find it lacks originality and depth, reminiscent of \"The Neverending Story.\" It's Miike's first co-written film, but his signature style is mostly absent, aside from a few familiar shots.\n\nDespite its potential, the film fails to deliver. If you're new to Miike, start with his acclaimed works like Gozu, Ichi the Killer, and Audition, then explore Blue's Harp, Fudoh, Rainy Dog, and Bird People in China.",
    "The lackluster direction leaves a competent cast stranded in an attractive yet uninspired adaptation, wherein the dialogue appears recited rather than genuine. The underfunded appearances of the ghosts fail to evoke any sense of awe or enchantment. Edward Woodward, portraying the Ghost of Christmas Present, teeters on stilts and seems to imitate Bernard Cribbins. As Scrooge, George C. Scott exhibits excessive wryness and never fully convinces, diminishing the impact of his performance. The scenes depicting his past carry as much weight as if he were apathetically flipping through a family album. The rest of the cast appears to put in minimal effort, with the exception of Frank Finlay, who tends to overact dramatically.",
    "I was very eager to watch this film after finally having read the book earlier this week. My 13-year-old son was also looking forward to it. We rented the movie and settled in to enjoy a classic holiday story brought to life on screen.\n\nHowever, I was quite disappointed. The film diverged from the book more times than I could forgive. While George C. Scott is an excellent actor, in this film, he seemed fully immersed in his character only about 20% of the time; the rest of his performance was rather flat.\n\nI understand that this film was made in 1984, largely before the advent of CGI effects. Nevertheless, it appeared to be of very B-movie quality, particularly during the encounter with Jacob Marley.\n\nThe most significant disappointment was the omission of one of the story's most moving parts: the scene where the Spirit of Christmas Present takes Scrooge on a whirlwind tour of the world, showing people in the bleakest of circumstances still experiencing the light and love of Christmastime.\n\nOn a positive note, Mr. Scott did an admirable job portraying the \"reformed\" Scrooge at the end, which was a refreshing depiction.\n\nI do wish that Bob Cratchit had been portrayed as more ragged and downtrodden. As for Tiny Tim... let's just say I was not impressed with the child actor's performance.",
    "Having seen three other versions of the same film, I must say this one is by far the weakest for me. Scott's rather dull and leaden performance is the primary reason. His emotions are so bland throughout that it makes it difficult to engage with the film. Alistair Sim portrayed the role infinitely better. At Scrooge's meanest, Scott's dialogue lacks conviction, and his transformation is equally unconvincing. None of the actors in this film match those from the Alistair Sim version. Even the musical version (and frankly the Muppets' take on this) are better executed. Very disappointing.",
    "I watched this movie in my English class and was surprised by how bad it was. George C. Scott was great as Scrooge, but the rest of the cast was terrible. The acting was often laughably bad, and the repeated line, \"Merry Christmas to everyone!\" was annoying. \n\nThe movie, based on a Charles Dickens story about a rich guy who thinks Christmas is humbug, involves him being visited by three ghosts who persuade him to celebrate Christmas. \n\nI can't understand why this poorly-written movie is so well-rated. Instead of this, I recommend the Bill Murray comedy Scrooged, which was actually funny.",
    "When will the pain stop? I never want to see another version of A Christmas Carol again. They keep making movies with the same story, each trying to outdo the others but failing miserably because it’s simply not a good story. It’s moralistic, old-fashioned, and conservatively optimistic. It’s as if people never learn. The countless versions of this film prove that we don’t.",
    "Last night at 9:30 PM, my friends and I were at a camping trailer, eagerly waiting to catch the new South Park episode. However, in my country, it doesn't air until 10:30 PM. To pass the time, we decided to watch Father of the Pride, which was currently on.\n\nI've only seen two episodes of Father of the Pride. My first impression wasn't great; I found it not only unfunny but also pointlessly crude. I even thought to myself, \"I have a football game early tomorrow, so I really should stop wasting time on these cartoons.\" Nevertheless, I tried to give Father of the Pride another chance last night. To me, it seems like a poor imitation of The Simpsons, just with lions instead of yellow-skinned human characters.\n\nAdditionally, I'm puzzled by its TV-14 rating. The Simpsons seems far more vulgar to me, and the only notable rudeness in Father of the Pride is a few unfunny homosexual jokes. The Simpsons is also significantly more violent, especially in the Halloween specials, and cruder in its humor. Interestingly, I learned that the creator of Father of the Pride also directed Shrek 2. I have to say, Shrek 2 was much better, and it seems like the creator was too focused on family themes in this series. That said, Father of the Pride did manage to make me smile or even laugh out loud a few times.\n\nOverall, I don't have strong feelings about Father of the Pride. I don't hate it, but I don't particularly like it either. Compared to The Simpsons, it falls short. \n\n3.5/10",
    "This film is a futuristic adaptation of Jules Verne's \"Mysterious Island\" but is riddled with flaws. The sound editing is poorly executed, with on-set dialogue overlapping voices recorded in a booth. It's an amateur film with actors from Boston, shot in New Hampshire, which may resonate strongly with New England residents. Throughout the movie, you can hear the director giving directions to the actors, making it feel unprofessional.\n\nThe character dynamics are unusual: one character communicates telepathically, while a blue alien character speaks with a deep voice but reverts to the actor's normal voice when yawning or fighting. The special effects, by Brett Piper, are imaginative but the animation is notably jerky, reminiscent of Karl Zeman's work in \"Journey to the Beginning of Time\" (1955). Despite a good musical score, the film’s overall quality pales in comparison to classics like \"Equinox\" or \"Planet of the Dinosaurs.\"\n\n\"Mysterious Planet\" was made on a shoestring budget as a home movie, which may be inspiring for aspiring filmmakers despite its numerous imperfections.",
    "Beyond a shadow of a doubt, \"Mysterious Planet\" stands as one of the worst movies ever made. Nevertheless, it holds a special place in my heart due to its rudimentary special effects and astonishingly poor soundtrack within the first 15 minutes, creating a concoction that is inadvertently hilarious.\n\nThe opening scene set in 'space' is as perplexing as cinematography can get, with bottles of washing-up liquid hurtling past amidst muffled dialogue. Before you can question your own sanity, the credits roll and the disjointed action begins to unfold.\n\nIn addition to a dual-headed plasticine giant snail that menaces our protagonists, the film offers the unique experience of hearing both the original actors' voices and their dubbed counterparts simultaneously. This bizarre detail adds to its unintentional charm.\n\nRegrettably for aficionados of such idiosyncratic cinema, I've only come across a single copy of this film, making it exceedingly unlikely that others will have the opportunity to view it. It is possible that I possess the only existing copy.",

    "William Russ takes center stage in this made-for-TV movie, stepping into a rollercoaster of a journey. After leaving his family behind, he reappears to settle his debts, all while trying to keep his distance from them. Enter the charismatic Peter Falk, beloved for his role as Columbo, who pops up in various roles to convince Russ to return home.\n\nThe film boasts an average storyline, but it shines a bit brighter thanks to Peter Falk’s seasoned presence. While William Russ may not be a household name, his acting does the job.\n\nThat said, the predictability of the plot made it feel like a cheese-fest. I could literally predict the lines in the last 20 minutes. A good movie should keep you on your toes, not let you write the script in your head.\n\nIn summary, this film doesn’t hit the mark. If we’re handing out grades, it earns a \"D.\"",
    "\"Finding John Christmas\" is a film best forgotten, marred by a nonsensical plot, poor dialogue, and disjointed scenes. The acting is lackluster, with no exception even for Peter Falk. Valerie Bertinelli delivers a performance devoid of depth or emotion, as do her co-stars William Russ (Hank) and David Cubitt (Noah). Jennifer Pisana's portrayal of Noah's daughter Soccoro is almost unbearable, both in acting and singing. However, it's hard to blame the actors given the subpar script by Michael J. Murray, which is juvenile at best.\n\nEach year, I eagerly peruse the TV guides, hoping to see classic Christmas and holiday films like \"Miracle on 34th Street,\" Ernst Lubitsch's delightful \"The Shop Around the Corner,\" and the 1951 version of \"Scrooge.\" There are also Frank Capra's classics like \"It's a Wonderful Life\" and \"Meet John Doe.\" Even more contemporary films like \"Home Alone\" and \"Home for the Holidays\" featuring Holly Hunter and a stellar performance by Robert Downey Jr. are worth revisiting.\n\nMy advice to you is to spend your time searching for these timeless films rather than watching \"Finding John Christmas.\" Merry Christmas!",
    "I usually don't comment on good films, but I can't stay silent about a bad one. Vivah, directed by Sooraj Badjatya, is a prime example of a bad movie. It seems Badjatya, after the success of Hum Aapke Hain Kaun, thought he could profit from making cheesy wedding videos. Vivah is overwhelmingly cheesy, outdoing even the Johars and Chopras.\n\nThroughout the movie, there isn't a single redeeming quality. Aloknath plays a stereotypical father's role, Shahid Kapoor looks unfit, and Amrita Rao's performance is disastrous. The sets are ugly, the costumes are bad, the storyline is hackneyed, and the actors are trying too hard. The background music is cacophonous, and the soundtracks are cheap.\n\nSpoiler alert: as with all of Badjatya's movies, despite a catastrophic event, the film ends on a happy note.",
    "I wouldn’t label this movie as bad, but it certainly falls short of being good. My expectations were high, especially after watching \"Hum Aapke Hain Kaun,\" which I found to be substantially better. This film feels outdated. Throughout the movie, I anticipated plot twists, yet what I received was a storyline where a girl gets burned and wins her aunt's love.\n\nDespite being engaged, the characters seek permission for every minor action, and their excessive shyness remains even after numerous meetings. I anticipated the aunt to be more ruthless, but her primary role was to complain incessantly.\n\nWe have children too, but we do not constantly watch them with tearing eyes. This movie portrays an idealistic dream: a happy family, a single cruel woman, kind in-laws, and a man deeply in love. In \"Hum Aapke Hain Kaun,\" Anupam Kher played the underprivileged bride’s father, and here the roles are reversed. Somehow, I also expected Mohnish Behl to appear in this film. Overall, watching this movie felt like a waste of time. I rate it 2/10.",
    "An adult take on a Cinderella story for those who love to dream. The romance is incredibly unrealistic, full of fluttery, lovey-dovey, perfect moments. It's the classic Cinderella plot all the way through, with Shahid Kapoor being the sole highlight for me. If you’re seeking a whimsical romance with a twist, this is the film for you. However, if you’re grounded in reality, I’d advise against spending three hours on this. Wake up, people!\n\nOut of the five friends who watched the film with me, four wouldn’t recommend it. We had a lot of fun criticizing many of the unrealistic scenes. Maybe I’m missing something, but I just can’t fathom how a movie like this could surpass a classic like HDDCS!",
    "Despite being absolutely captivated by Mr. Brosnan's exceptional performance as a cad in \"The Tailor of Panama\"—a film I would give a perfect score for its casting, acting, script, story, editing, pace, music, and emotional impact—I approached this new film with high expectations. Unfortunately, it fell far short. It felt more like a script reading than a fully realized movie, with vulgarity seemingly included just for shock value, and lacking the richness and satisfaction that characterized \"The Tailor of Panama.\" The shortcomings can be attributed to both the screenwriting and directing. I spent the entire film waiting for a standout moment, but it never arrived. There were no laughs, no tears, though one line of dialogue did manage to make me smile. Was it worth the $7 ticket? Not at all.",
    "I almost walked out, but I had already paid, and my equally upset friend wanted to stick it out. After the charm and excitement of \"A New Hope\" and \"The Empire Strikes Back,\" I looked forward to \"Return of the Jedi\" with high hopes. But from the first scene, I was deeply disappointed and angry at George Lucas. He should have been ashamed, but this movie showed he had no shame at all. Episode I would confirm it further -- just mentioning Jar Jar Binks proves the point.\n\nRight from the start at Jabba's palace, this movie felt like a long commercial for as many toy figures as Lucas could fit in – the pig-like guards, the sidekick with the head-tails, Jabba's pet, the dancers, the monsters, and more. Then there were the cute, marketable Ewoks and the various Rebel aliens. Each one got just enough screen time to make kids want the toys. The way Lucas targeted kids for profit was sickening.\n\nLucas didn't even come up with a new plot – he just reused the Death Star from \"A New Hope\" and added cheap sentiment. It felt like a huge insult to his fans. It seemed like Lucas took pleasure in creating terrible content because he knew fans would still come, and kids would beg their parents for the toys, making him richer.\n\nThere might have been a few good moments in this disappointment. I think Harrison Ford did his best to stay afloat. But any small bright spots were buried under the overwhelming commercialism that Lucas embraced just for profit.",
    "Despite a talented cast, this routine tale of a secretary murdered by her married lover falls flat. The story raises more questions than it answers, offering only the prosecution's perspective. Aimed at those who revel in tales of male villainy, it portrays an innocent woman ensnared in an affair with a high-profile attorney. Would the tragic events have unfolded if she hadn't been involved with a married man? You won't miss much by stepping away during this predictable narrative.",
    "This film was disjointed, incoherent, and felt overly forced. It also presented a deeply negative and mean-spirited depiction of women. I rented it under the impression that it was a comedy (a significant stretch), and because the cover suggested Andie McDowell was delivering an exceptional performance. She wasn’t. As a woman watching with two male friends, we spent an hour afterwards discussing just how poor the film was.\n\nWARNING: PLOT SUMMARY BELOW! RAMPANT SPOILERS!\n\nThe movie begins with a cliché plot about an older woman involved with a younger man, much to the dismay of her two jealous, single girlfriends. They prefer she marry a dull man their own age who has feelings for her. Nevertheless, she is so happy with her energetic younger partner that you root for them to make it. Eventually, she decides to marry him. However, her manipulative girlfriend, with help from the indecisive one, devises a plan to make her believe the young man is unfaithful. The plan succeeds, leading to a fight, and he tragically dies when he runs out and is hit by a truck (hence, the film’s title). By this point, two-thirds into the movie, our protagonist, who is a headmistress overseeing a school for girls, is revealed to be pregnant – apparently having neglected birth control.\n\nShe breaks ties with her girlfriends due to their lack of support and, feeling alone and desperate, decides to marry the boring man. Incidentally, he is a minister, whom she had previously asked to officiate her wedding to the young man (charming, right?). Now, she proposes to the minister, who inexplicably has no objections to this sudden change. At the altar, her girlfriends intervene and take her home, barely admitting their major role in her true love’s demise. She has the baby, and in the final scene, they leave the infant in a crib inside her house while they lounge on the porch, drinking, smoking, and acting self-satisfied. It really is that bad. I haven’t even mentioned the convoluted subplot involving a cancer scare and the melodramatic, unnecessary lesbian scene.",
    "This film feels like a desperate cash grab, riding on the coattails of Sex and the City and Four Weddings and a Funeral. They might have done better at the box office if they'd named it Sex at a Funeral.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the movie flounders and can't find its footing. The characters spout unnaturally sharp dialogue, but their actions are far from believable. Scenes string together with arbitrary nonsense just to push along a flimsy plot, making the whole thing feel exhaustingly fake.<br /><br />Andie MacDowell gives her all, truly pouring her heart into her performance. However, Imelda Staunton effortlessly steals the spotlight as a police detective (isn't there usually a height requirement?). Staunton is impeccable in every scene. If only we could say the same for the writer-director.<br /><br />If Notting Hill's phoniness irritated you, steer clear of this one. It's faux pas on a platter.",
    "This film is easily among the worst I've ever seen. Picture this: Kate shows up, Jed is surrounded by a group of guys, and they all start clapping. It's painfully cliché, straight out of Hollywood's playbook. Then there's a laughable scene where Kate strokes the pavement as if she's examining its texture—completely baffling. \n\nAndie's acting is abysmal; I couldn't connect with her or feel any genuine chemistry. On the flip side, the two other female characters were stellar and completely outshone Andie. The movie teeters on the edge of campiness, and while I typically enjoy that genre, I just couldn't get into this one. The film is riddled with implausible scenarios, and Andie's lackluster performance only drags it down further. And oh, don't get me started on her appearance. It's like Lancome applied her makeup with a putty knife—she looks glamorous in commercials, but it just doesn't translate on screen.",
    "The movie starts off poorly, with three women behaving like immature adolescents, giggling with their gin, smoking endless cigarettes, and awarding a caramel chocolate treat to whoever tells the best story about men. It takes a turn for the worse when Andie's character, the headmistress of an English school, falls in love with a young organ player who was once her student at the age of 14. Her malicious girlfriend ruins their relationship. After that, the plot devolves into an unwatchable mess: Andie's character forgives her friend, has the organ player's child, and the three women return to their routine of drinking gin and smoking cigarettes. In a futile attempt at character development, Andie's character throws the caramel chocolates into the street. How disappointing.",
    "This film was a disappointment. Andie MacDowell's performance was lacking; her acting was so stiff that it made a rocking horse seem expressive. Her role in \"Four Weddings and a Funeral\" was similarly agonizing. The movie also perpetuates a cliched image of England, filled with picturesque cottages and village greens. The school in the film, for instance, looks unrealistically magical—more like Hogwarts than any real school. The quaint police station seemed like a set from \"Heartbeat,\" a saccharine British series from the '60s.\n\nThe film struggled to decide whether it wanted to be a comedy or a serious look into the complexities of women's friendships. If it had committed to being a comedy, perhaps the graveyard sex scenes and the absurd wedding disruption might have worked—just barely. Unfortunately, these scenes clashed with the tragic elements in the second half. It also seemed unrealistic that Kate would ever forgive Molly for her atrocious behavior.\n\nLastly, it's puzzling why talented actresses like Imelda Staunton and Anna Chancellor participated in this project. MacDowell would be better suited for commercial work, such as promoting skincare products.",
    "I watched this on IFC yesterday and can't believe the positive reviews. Am I the only one who found the \"ladies\" completely unbelievable? Kate tells Jed she could get fired because she's supposed to be a pillar of the community, then sleeps with him. Then they suddenly decide they're in love? She's so devastated over his death that she doesn't go to his funeral or tell his family the \"good news.\" Also, how did an American become the headmistress of a very proper British school? Janine should have been kicked off the force for her abuse of power, but nothing happens. She ends up with a con she brought in for questioning. And let's not even get started on Molly.\n\nAs for the guilt Janine and Molly feel over Jed, it's his own fault he got run over. Where's the guilt over Gerald, who gets puked on? I wish I could do the same to the people who made this \"movie.\"",
    "I initially thought it was a movie set in New York—wrong! It's actually set in the quaint British countryside.\n\nI assumed it was a comedy—wrong again! It's a drama. Well, at least until the last third, when the story becomes utterly \"abracadabrantesque,\" a term used during a French presidential mandate to describe something close to nonsense, even if the intentions aim to evoke sincere feelings.\n\nSo, what’s worth noting? Perhaps the dynamic duo of actresses. Yes, I recognize there are three friends, but the redheaded policewoman seemed almost invisible to me. The tall doctor impresses with her toughness, and McDowell delivers her usual fine acting—delicate, soft, and nearly mute. This gentleness intrigues me because it's a recurring theme with other fine artists and directors too. In McDowell's case, she consistently plays a character defined by her emotions and values, living endless different stories. I still struggle to distinguish between the artist and their work.\n\nAnother positive aspect of this film is its feminine touch and the varied perspectives it offers. Each woman has her own way of living, even though they are all single. It's enlightening to see how a single reality can be perceived in so many diverse ways.\n\nIn the end, the movie is fairly enjoyable, but the conclusion diminishes the desire for a rewatch.",
    "Was this supposed to be a comedy or a serious drama? The movie begins with light-hearted banter among three women, then shifts to conflict when one meets a man. That's fine. There are some funny moments. Fine. But when the plot gets darker, I started to wonder if I misunderstood the beginning. It keeps going like this until it tries to return to the light-hearted tone at the end. By then, it's too late. It's hard to believe the women would still be talking to each other, and the ending is unconvincing. This is a clear example of how not to make movies. It's surprising the producers thought it would work, and the box office failure proved it. I hadn't heard of this film until this weekend, four years after its release.",
    "Andie McDowell shines as a beautiful woman in her 40s who, after a late start in serious relationships, finds herself involved with a much younger man. This newfound romance causes a rift with her two longtime best friends.\n\nBelieving the young man to be a gigolo or gold-digger, the friends are determined to end the \"silly relationship.\" They go to great lengths to \"help\" their friend, whom they see as being manipulated by this supposed gigolo.\n\nThe resulting situations are utterly ridiculous and unrealistic. Such far-fetched scenes undermine what could have been a sweet love story. Instead, viewers are likely to find themselves shaking their heads in disbelief because such events simply don't happen. \n\nWithout spoiling the ending, I advise viewers not to set high expectations for this film, as many, including myself, will likely be disappointed. On a scale of 1 to 10, I would rate this movie a weak 4. There is much better material out there, and this one isn’t worth your time.",
    "SPOILER: The young lover, Jed, is kicked out by the spinster, Kate (Andie McDowell), because she mistakenly believes Jed is having an affair with one of her two gossipy friends. Kate thought she caught them red-handed. She throws Jed's shoes out the door. Jed hesitantly leaves, sits in the middle of the road to put his shoes on, and then gets hit by a truck and dies (\"Crushed,\" one meaning of the title).\n\n\"And then he gets run over by a truck.\" Can you believe a screenwriter actually included this plot twist? Up to that point, it’s a comedy aiming for a lighthearted feel but falls flat. Everyone except Jed is just irritating. Then Jed gets killed, everyone mourns, and by the end, the women learn to love and support each other instead of tearing each other down. I rate it 2 \"ugh\"s.",
    "The most disappointing thing about \"Crush\" isn't the subpar acting or the almost non-existent plot. It's not even the mediocre camerawork.\n\nNo, what really gets to you are the few moments of brilliance that give you hope there might be more.\n\nUnfortunately, these moments are too few and far between. If you enjoy violin music and melodramatic scenes of women over 40 crying, hugging, and discussing babies and marriage, then you might find it worthwhile.\n\nHowever, these elements didn't appeal to me, making my experience quite unpleasant. The occasional clever joke can't make up for the rest.\n\nOverall, I'd rate it 4/10. It's guilty of wasting my time.",
    "It’s not a 'woman film' but a film for a general audience. It's one of the worst films ever created by a male director about women. Director Adam McKay clearly lacks understanding of women. The film demonstrates poor taste, reminiscent of American Pie's humor with a crude and nonsensical storyline and poorly developed characters. Vulgar fantasies are brought to life on screen, resulting in an insulting and definitely unfunny movie. I am perplexed as to why three talented actresses agreed to participate in it.",
    "As a single woman over 40, I found this film extremely insulting and demeaning to women in my age group, as well as to women of all ages. It was a pathetic attempt by a man to write and direct a \"chick flick,\" and it failed miserably. Andy McDowell, who isn't a strong actress to begin with, had no chance due to the nonexistent plot. There was no character development, no reason to feel sympathy or empathy towards any of the characters, and no effort to make the film realistic or believable. Additionally, the cliché of an attractive straight woman suddenly deciding to explore lesbianism was utterly ridiculous.\n\nI not only want my money back for the DVD rental but also wish I could get back those 112 minutes of my life. What a ripoff.",
    "I was initially thrilled by the premise of this film—the intricate friendship of three women disrupted when one falls for a younger man. Intriguing, right?\n\nWell, not so much. Unfortunately, the women are exaggerated caricatures, depicted as unsupportive and constantly scheming against each other. Despite my admiration for Anna Chancellor and Imelda Staunton, even their talent couldn't salvage a script that awkwardly blends slapstick and screwball comedy. This approach falls flat, especially in the claustrophobic setting of a small town.\n\nFor characters meant to be intelligent, they spend an inordinate amount of time lamenting the absence of men, sex, and passion in their lives. Given a better script and more genuine tension, the film could have been so much more. Instead, the half-baked lesbian subplot goes nowhere, and the portrayal of the women as heavy smokers and drinkers, even in implausible situations like during a baby scene, strains credulity. It's frustrating to see characters in their forties depicted so unrealistically—\"Screw the baby, gimme a cigarette!\" Really?\n\nAll in all, this movie is a disappointing waste of potential. I'd give it a 4 out of 10.",
    "\"The Crush\" is a pretty enjoyable rom-com about a group of 40-something friends, kind of like a British version of \"Sex and the City\" for the first two-thirds. \n\nI really liked the twist with the young hunk's character—though we don't get much backstory or see enough of Kenny Doughty (who's definitely worth more screen time).\n\nThere's a big focus on the young man/older woman dynamic, way more than we've seen with older guy/younger girl in movies like \"Sabrina\" (I don't like either version) or even the real-life couples like Douglas/Zeta-Jones or Dion and her mentor.\n\nAndie MacDowell plays an ex-pat, surrounded by familiar faces from British dramas and comedies, like the sharp-tongued Anna Chancellor.\n\nThe plot gets kinda wild towards the end, and everything wraps up in a deus ex machina style. It wasn't until the credits rolled that I figured out what felt off. Just like \"Sex and the City,\" the writer/director is a guy—in this case, Scot John McKay in his debut. I suspect he originally wanted to write about three gay men dealing with coming out and their relationships at work (the characters are a school principal, a cop, and a doctor). That would've been a more interesting film, to be honest. The movie's working title was \"The Sad F*cker's Club,\" which would have made its similarities with \"Broken Hearts Club\" even more obvious.\n\n(originally written 4/6/2002)",
    "This movie had the potential to be enjoyable if it had delved into more intriguing aspects rather than just the superficial elements of a lesbian relationship. If the intention was merely to depict that, the plot is rather predictable. Additionally, the two lead actresses bear a striking resemblance to the Russian musical duo t.A.T.u., which does not seem to be a coincidence. This lack of originality implies that the filmmakers relied on an already popular group to attract attention.\n\nThe supporting cast appears to lack clear purpose within the story. Although many of them are well-known in Romania, some are not even professional actors, such as Mihaela Rădulescu. In summary, the film seems to be a combination of a \"girl band\" concept akin to t.A.T.u., actors seeking publicity, a nonexistent plot, and gratuitous use of offensive language meant to shock the audience. The result is a disappointing film titled \"Love Sick.\" It's unfortunate because the initial concept had promise. Additionally, refraining from commenting on the title is challenging due to its lack of fittingness.",
    "***LIGHT SPOILER ALERT*** The storyline is intriguing, and those familiar with the novel might anticipate a profound and intense film that explores intriguing and underrepresented human connections.\n\nWhile the script and direction make an effort to achieve this, the lead actors unfortunately fall short. Maria's performance is notably lackluster, devoid of emotion, and her most intense scenes come off as almost laughable. She appears to be uneasy in front of the camera, although she does deliver one genuinely moving scene towards the end when her character is dumped by her girlfriend.\n\nIoana's performance fares even worse; she appears tense and unnatural throughout. Maria at least has some semblance of attitude, albeit artificially exaggerated, which lends her character some credibility. However, Ioana's character lacks depth and backstory. There's no explanation of her origins, how she became involved in the lesbian relationship, or how the relationship developed. We get only sporadic glimpses of her parents, and their relationship appears to just 'exist' without any beginning - merely content and conclusion. Similar to Maria, Ioana has only one truly touching scene, where she breaks up with Maria's character, Kiki.\n\nTudor, alongside the commendable performance of the landlady, is the only actor who displays notable talent. He embodies his character well, only faltering once or twice, such as during the meal scene with his parents, where his performance is unnecessarily overt.\n\nWhile I appreciate the story and Tudor Chirila's satisfactory performance, as well as the landlady's convincing acting and Puya's stylish delivery of his brief lines, these positives are insufficient to salvage the film. It's unfortunate, as the setting had immense potential and Romanian cinema could have benefitted from a film tackling this theme.\n\nIronically, the incestuous relationship between the brother and sister seems more credible than the poorly developed and emotionally hollow lesbian relationship between Maria and Ioana. Regrettably, I feel my money was wasted on a ticket when I would have been better off watching it at home.",
    "This movie exploits controversial themes like incest and lesbianism just to attract attention. The dialogues are dreadful, and the \"sex scenes\" lack any sensuality. The acting and dialogue are more appropriate for high-school productions, despite the adult subject matter. It is a gutless and shallow film that could have been significantly improved with a coherent story and more drama. The excessive use of inner monologues cheapens it further. Overall, it's an embarrassment for Romanian cinema and mature viewers. Limited resources are no excuse for a flop like this. And please, cast real actors instead of recycling musicians like Tudor Chirila, who clearly can't act!",
    "I found myself less enchanted by \"Love Sick\" than I initially anticipated. The film delves into the complex sexual relationships between Alex, Kiki, and Sandu, capturing a love triangle steeped in intensity, frustration, and jealousy. In the end, Alex comes to the realization that their intertwined lives do not have a future, leading to a sad conclusion.\n\nDirector Tudor Giurgiu attended a screening at AMC theater on Sunday, August 10, 2006, at 12:00 PM, sharing his vision with the audience. He explained that the film aimed to portray the intricate nature of Romanian sexual relationships.\n\nFrom my perspective, complicated sexual relationships are not unique to Romania; they exist everywhere. The storyline involving Alex, Kiki, and Kiki's brother Sandu seemed like an ordinary neighborhood tale to me.\n\nThere are two main reasons why the film did not resonate with me. Firstly, the film did not adequately explain how Alex and Kiki's love began. It felt abrupt and unconvincing, as if they fell in love merely because Alex moved into Kiki's building. It requires too much imagination to piece together the fragmented story. Secondly, there were no intimate scenes between Alex and Kiki, which left me wanting more insight into their relationship. However, the film did have some redeeming moments. The ear-piercing scene was particularly poignant, as it symbolized Alex's willingness to endure pain for Kiki's love. Additionally, the scene where they lie on a soccer field and express their love was sincere and passionate, offering a glimpse into the depth of their feelings.",
    "I didn't enjoy \"Love Sick\" as much as I expected. The film explores the intense, frustrating, and jealous sexual relationships between Alex, Kik, and Sandu, culminating in Alex's realization that their relationship has no future, leading to a sad ending.\n\nDirector Tudor Giurgiu attended a screening at AMC Theatre on 08/10/06 and explained that the film aims to depict the complexities of Romanian sexual relationships.\n\nI found the portrayal of sexual life to be universally complicated and unremarkable. The relationships between Alex, Kik, and Sandu felt like a typical neighborhood story.\n\nThe film fell short for two main reasons: it didn't convincingly show how Alex and Kik's relationship began, and it lacked a key scene depicting their sexual intimacy, which I anticipated. Despite these flaws, the ear-piercing scene and the heartfelt conversation on the soccer field were noteworthy and added depth to their love story.",
    "Given the significant and seemingly effective promotional campaign for this movie, I anticipated it would live up to the hype. However, it disappoints from the very start. The opening scene, where the two brothers share a supposedly \"sensual\" moment in bed, sets the tone for a rapid decline. There is nothing engaging or thought-provoking in the entire plot. The acting is generally poor, with only a few minor exceptions, and feels highly contrived.\n\nWhile incest and lesbianism could be intriguing themes, the script fails to explore either with any real depth. If the filmmakers claim they were aiming for subtlety, it would be laughable unless they equate subtlety with superficiality. Viewers hoping for any compelling scenes will be let down, a factor that might have partially redeemed the movie but ultimately doesn't.\n\nFor those curious enough to watch, you'll find yourself wasting approximately 90 minutes of your life, just as I did. Many more criticisms could be shared, but I'll leave it to you to experience the disappointment firsthand.",
    "Indeed, it had the potential to be a good movie. Featuring a love biangle—apologies for the creative liberty, as it is not quite a triangle—it presents an interesting story that, regrettably, is poorly told. The cinematography fluctuates between awkward and acceptable, giving the impression of a crowded and short-sighted visual presentation. The audio, as is often the case with Romanian films, requires more meticulous attention. Additionally, the lighting and color filters are sometimes inappropriately selected. The soundtrack is brief and fails to support the narrative effectively. Regarding the acting, it is unfortunate to note that the landlady's performance is the most commendable. The remaining cast members deliver immature performances that fail to engage the audience convincingly. The acting is overly poetic when a realistic approach is needed and vice versa. This film, ostensibly intended for an adult audience, is conveyed as if by children. Only consider watching if exceedingly curious.",
    "Stan Lathan's \"Beat Street\" presents a more authentic and layered portrayal than \"Breakdance,\" but it remains rather unremarkable. This film also profits from the 'breakdancing' trend; however, it offers some entertainment through its plot, which follows three young friends and a younger brother growing up in Queens, New York. Each character showcases a unique talent: one is a hustler, another a DJ, a third an artist creating 'burners,' and the youngest, Lee, is a talented hip-hop dancer.\n\nDespite this, Lathan struggles to engage the audience with the story, and the young cast members also have difficulty connecting with their characters. Consequently, the film relies heavily on its energetic music and impressive dance sequences to maintain interest.\n\nThe choreography is precise and vibrant in both club and street settings, but this is not enough to elevate \"Beat Street\" significantly. Ultimately, the film falls short, especially towards the end, despite briefly hinting at the potential to become more engaging.\n\nReviewed on Sunday, August 25, 1996 - Video.",
    "This film attempts to depict a group of high school teenagers heavily involved in the hip-hop culture, including break dancing, graffiti, and aspiring to become DJs at the Roxy nightclub. However, the drama is painfully obvious and lacks any subtlety, leaving me so disinterested I could hardly remember the details. Even fans of the music genre agree that the acting is dismal, and the film's attempt at drama falls flat. \n\nWe're meant to perceive these teenagers as likable and endearing, but instead, they come off as dull and uninspiring. Ramon, in particular, was a character I found especially irritating. His graffiti on subway trains is portrayed as admirable, which I find perplexing since it constitutes defacing public property. Additionally, these supposedly \"great\" kids illegally tap into the city's electricity to host a dance party in an abandoned building. We're expected to see these lawbreakers as charming and fun, but I couldn't find them anything but irresponsible.\n\nEven if I could overlook these issues, the music was a major problem for me. I have a strong aversion to hip-hop, and the songs in the movie were mediocre at best. They were incessantly playing, to the point where I started fast-forwarding through many of the endless musical numbers. Without the music, the film would probably be a mere 30 minutes long. \n\nThere are a few creative scenes, like a subway dance fight, a genuinely funny Santa number, and the climactic show at the Roxy. If you're a hip-hop enthusiast, this might be your kind of movie. However, if you're seeking quality drama, look elsewhere. Additionally, how this movie received a PG rating is beyond me, given the substantial amount of swearing throughout.",
    "Wild Style and Style Wars represent original Hip Hop, whereas Beat Street, despite featuring many early Hip Hop artists, lacks authenticity. It's overproduced and influenced by Hollywood. Instead, seek out the first two movies for a gritty portrayal of life in the ghetto.\n\nAlthough Beat Street's rating is low, its positive reviews stem from the music and dancing, despite poor story, acting, dialogue, and direction. Personally, I enjoy the dancing but dislike the movie's electro beats, which I felt marked the decline of Hip Hop until new artists emerged around '86.\n\nIn contrast, Wild Style's music remains great and authentic, despite a minimal story. Opinions vary, but for me, Beat Street fails except for the break dancing and some music, so I rate it 4 out of 10.",
    "I found myself unable to tolerate watching \"Happy Days\" once Chachi joined the cast, so I was immediately concerned when the most notable scene in this film featured Scott Baio—a skateboard chase, no less. Jodie Foster, in her first mature role, delivers her character with her customary professionalism, but this still does not redeem the film from being an insipid waste of time. The two hours I invested in watching it are hours I shall never recover. The film is devoid of noteworthy characters, features an implausible storyline, suffers from questionable editing, and exhibits horrendous cinematography. Most critically, it failed to engage me at any level. The narrative, concerning California teenagers in the 1970s, depicts these young people living in despair and their parents portrayed as fools. I would strongly advise against wasting your time on this inferior cinematic endeavor.",
    "Awful movie with random Ramones cameos. It’s your typical cheesy 70s/80s comedy about the cool kids taking over the school with some silly scheme. The plot’s about a girl who loves the Ramones and a school trying to fight its strict administration. Seriously, skip this one and watch something like Wild Zero with Guitar Wolf if you’re looking for an entertaining B movie. The acting, writing, and plot are all terrible. The only reason the Ramones are involved is probably because they needed money. This movie sucks.",
    "Get ready for a wild ride with this movie—a 90-minute Ramones concert punctuated by bouts of pure absurdity and mind-numbing tedium. Seriously, what kind of high school is this?\n\nIf you're not a die-hard Ramones fan, heed my warning: DO NOT, and I repeat, DO NOT waste your time like I did. This film is completely unwatchable from beginning to end. It deserves the title \"Ramone Fever,\" because everyone seems obsessed with them in this flick. Don’t expect a plot—there’s none to be found. When it comes to teen comedies, this one is scraping the absolute bottom of the barrel.",
    "I awarded this film two stars solely due to Dominic Monaghan's commendable effort in his acting. Unfortunately, the remainder of the film exhibits an extreme lack of professionalism. The direction of this film was executed very poorly. The director should seriously reconsider her career choices and perhaps dedicate time to watching a few films to improve her skills. Despite Dominic Monaghan's esteemed reputation as an actor, his involvement in a film of this quality detracts from his credibility. The individual portraying Jack's best friend demonstrated a lack of suitability for appearing on screen. Although I did not have high expectations for such a modest production, a greater investment of time and effort into developing the characters and their environment was necessary. I strongly advise against spending your time or money on this film, as it will undoubtedly leave you disappointed.",
    "I eagerly seized the opportunity to watch this film unedited and without interruptions, recalling the acclaim it had received. However, whenever the movie seemed poised to become truly terrifying, it retreated and diverted its focus. The persistent sound of dripping water throughout the house, the ominous black rain, prophetic dreams, and wrong turns through raw sewage were all abandoned before they could culminate in a genuine fright.\n\nWhat a disappointment it turned out to be. Chamberlain's nearly expressionless face conveyed little more than confused disbelief, a sentiment I found myself sharing as the film progressed. What could have been eerie Aboriginal chanting and instrumental background music instead became a cacophony seemingly intended to force terror upon the audience. Concepts such as modern individuals embodying ancient gods, the Aboriginal belief that red-haired white men were the first priests, and many other intriguing ideas were presented more like a mundane checklist than an invitation to explore another dimension (the Dream Time).\n\n[SPOILER] In the final scene, the director's intent was unclear. Is there a big wave? So what? How big is it? A tsunami? Sure, that's devastating but not apocalyptic. Is it the end of the world, from a wave? The last wave? It would have to be an extraordinarily massive wave. Why? Was the world portrayed as such a terrible place? It didn't seem that awful in this film. In fact, I doubted the wave even happened since the shadow cast on Burton’s face by the wave disappeared. Was it only Burton's personal apocalypse? That happens every day to people who experience a mental breakdown. It held no interest if it was solely his plight.\n\nThe most chilling scene, and the one that best showcases Weir's potential, occurs in Charlie's apartment where Burton confronts the old man for frightening his wife. Charlie repeatedly asks, \"Who are you?\" and the question becomes increasingly unsettling. Regrettably, the rest of the film fails to follow this promising lead.",
    "Get ready for a thrilling ride! The perfect murder plot unravels in spectacular fashion when a wife (played by the brilliant Mary Ellen Trainor, who was once married to acclaimed director Robert Zemeckis, who directs this episode) takes out her husband with a poker. Just as she's about to move the body, an unexpected visitor arrives – an escaped lunatic dressed as Santa Claus (portrayed by the wickedly grotesque Larry Drake). \n\nIn a heart-pounding race against time, the wife must fend off this deranged Santa while figuring out how to conceal her husband's corpse. She seizes an opportunity to frame the killer by using an ax, nearly losing her head several times in the process! The twisted Santa locks her in a closet and goes after her daughter, igniting an electrifying struggle as she desperately tries to break free and save her child.\n\nThis episode of TALES FROM THE CRYPT delivers non-stop suspense, blending the classic \"Santa kills\" trope with a familiar tale of marital betrayal. Mary Ellen Trainor’s riveting performance anchors a plot that's a pulse-quickening ride, even if it treads some well-worn paths. Though it may not be the most groundbreaking story, its sheer intensity makes it a standout moment of dark, gleeful terror!",
    "That's not the sound of bees; it's the effect induced by watching this extremely long, extremely boring, badly acted movie. How I ever made it through all 3 1/2 hours without falling asleep, I'll never know. The plot is simple: three thoroughly unlikable morons talk about sex for 3 1/2 hours. And you thought Rohmer was deadly? This is even worse, if that's possible. I must really be a masochist to watch this entire movie without turning it off or losing my sanity.",
    "Iberia is nice to watch on TV, but why see it on the big screen? It features a lot of dance and music. If you're a fan of classical music or modern dance, it might be the perfect movie for you. Otherwise, an hour and a half can feel too long. For skillful dancing on the big screen, Bollywood movies are a better choice as they excel at combining breathtaking dancing with lengthy films. Director Carlos Saura has a wealth of experience in filming dance, and it shows at times. However, for a movie that's an hour and a half long, it should be consistently engaging. While there are many forms of art, not all are larger than life, and this film doesn't quite reach that level.",
    "I am astonished that reviewers enjoyed this movie. The plot is convoluted and difficult to follow. The characters lack depth and are unconvincing. Michael Bowen spends most of the film observing other characters and repeatedly misinterpreting their actions. None of the characters possess any likable qualities or unique traits. This work lacks edginess, imagination, irony, and cleverness. Its tedious nature makes it unsurprising that it did not receive a theatrical release. The fact that \"This Network\" airs it only lowers the quality of that channel. I highly recommend switching to a rerun of \"Garden Smart\" on PBS, or even watching an informative show, if you come across this movie late at night. If you find it on daytime television, consider taking a long walk instead. Even if you walk in smog, it will be more enjoyable than enduring this chaotic mess. Life is too short to waste on a movie this long and unengaging.",
    "This is a terrible movie with a bad script, poor direction, and a nonsensical ending. The performances are mostly bad, except for Clancy Brown, who is sadly underused, and Michael Pollard. Watching this movie felt like torture--you endure it only to balance out your bad movie experiences and hope for a good one later.\n\nThe movie shows a father and son who don't look related at all. The male lead's character is poorly written and lacks charisma. The plot is predictable, and the actions of the female lead and her cop brother make no sense. A major action by her at the end doesn’t make sense in the story.",
    "Once regarded as a skilled director, Burt Kennedy's latest effort is an unmitigated disaster that fails on almost every level. This film isn't just cheap—it epitomizes cheapness, with battle scenes shamelessly recycled from the far superior 1955 classic \"The Last Command.\" Shockingly, these 32-year-old snippets look more modern than anything newly filmed for this production. The scant action scenes Kennedy manages to shoot are chaotic and poorly executed, much like the rest of this disjointed mess. The film exudes the amateurish vibe of a low-budget student project, and it trudges along with the sluggish pace of thick molasses.\n\nThe acting here ranges from outrageously overdone to virtually lifeless, with only Raul Julia managing to rise above the mediocrity pervading his co-stars' performances. Historical inaccuracies abound, adding yet another layer of frustration. And if you thought it couldn't get worse, the lengthy runtime will make you wish for a swift conclusion—three excruciating hours instead of a more mercifully brief bore-fest.\n\nFor a gripping and well-crafted story of the Alamo, turn to John Wayne's 1960 version or the very film this one cannibalizes. It's incomprehensible how it took six producers to generate something so profoundly flawed. Spare yourself the pain—skip this one.",
    "This James Arness western might've aimed high, but it spectacularly missed the mark as the worst Alamo film ever! The storyline? A disaster, riddled with inaccuracies and outright fabrications. Continuity? Completely abandoned. Did anyone notice the cannon sequence? The Mexicans absurdly fire cannons clogged with mud and ramrods. Seriously? And let's not forget Brian Keith's outlandish hat—what was the costumer thinking? Or were they even there?",
    "This movie misses the mark on multiple levels. Instead of delivering a credible portrayal of the Alamo, it falls into the trap of perpetuating myths rather than presenting historical truths. The production quality is subpar, making it seem like a last-resort job opportunity for actors who might otherwise be relegated to game shows.\n\nThe most glaring issue is the casting. Knowing the ages and personalities of the real Alamo figures, the choice of older TV actors destroys any semblance of authenticity. As a native Texan familiar with both the mythology and the history, I can appreciate a well-made rendition from either angle—though I lean toward historical accuracy. Unfortunately, this film fails to offer even a moment of enjoyment.\n\nIn comparison, John Wayne's and Fess Parker's versions, though not without their faults, at least brought the story to life. This iteration, however, is a dull and disappointing mess. Do yourself a favor and skip it.",
    "Despite its slow pace and occasional inaccuracies, this account of the famed and heroic siege of the Alamo during the Texas fight for independence from Mexico remains captivating. James Arness stars as the rugged Jim Bowie, with Brian Keith as the legendary Davy Crockett, and Alec Baldwin as the determined Col. Travis. Raul Julia masterfully portrays General Santa Anna. This made-for-TV project also features David Ogden Stiers, Kathleen York, and Jim Metzler, all supported by Peter Bernstein's stirring original music.",
    "The Alamo: Thirteen Days to Glory is a total letdown. The acting is painfully bad, the patriotism feels over the top, and the historical inaccuracies would drive any historian crazy. While there are a few decent scenes, they’re not enough to hold your attention through the overly lengthy runtime. Rating: * out of **********.",
    "Norman Maclean's story is a masterpiece, while Redford's adaptation falls flat. He adds uninspired scenes of the Maclean brothers going over a waterfall and double-dating in a shabby bar, which are not present in the original story. Brad Pitt's attempt to portray the charismatic Paul Maclean, a virtuoso outdoorsman, comes off as either laughable or disheartening, depending on your attachment to the original narrative. Some fly casting scenes are visually stunning. Additionally, Tom Skerritt as the father and Craig Sheffer as Norman are robust and manly, reflecting traditional expectations of men. Unfortunately, none of the women leave a memorable impression in the film, which is a pity, since Maclean adored the women in his story and expressed this sentiment in a clear, even poetic manner.",
    "The film's only redeeming quality is its stunning scenery. Otherwise, it was an excruciatingly long and tedious experience. The minister's credibility should have been questioned the moment his son, Paul, abandoned everything he preached. As someone supposedly from a Presbyterian background, it's jarring how frequently the characters blaspheme. Paul (Brad Pitt) should have been swept away by the river at the very start, sparing us his insufferable, self-centered story. The narrative of Norm becoming a teacher and Paul a compulsive gambler whom Norm fails to save is painfully dull. The most intriguing scene, where Paul stands up against the prejudiced whites for his Native American girlfriend, had potential but was sorely underdeveloped. Instead, we're left with a lethargic tale of two minister's sons: Norm, who pursues a lackluster relationship, and Paul, who wastes time concocting silly stories and tying flies. I’d prefer to watch an actual fishing show over enduring this film ever again.",
    "... It's not advisable to live in Montana, particularly not at the end of the 19th century.\n\n\"A River Runs Through It\" is certainly a well-crafted movie from a cinematic standpoint, showcasing breathtaking landscapes and strong performances by Robert Redford.\n\nHowever, the story is weak, if it can even be called a story.\n\nI felt sorry for the narrator/author, who comes across as dry and narrow-minded, much like his father, a preacher. He is propelled by circumstances rather than taking charge of his own life, watching helplessly as his brother, also trapped in the confines of their small town, loses his way. The author never truly understands his brother's motivations, but at least he realizes that he himself lacks any sense of humor or fun. For him, life revolves around fly-fishing, an activity he pursues even into old age, adhering to his father's approach.\n\nThe ending is unsurprising and predictable from the outset.\n\nDefinitely not a must-see (3/10).",
    "I believe a good film usually has an engaging plot. Unfortunately, this particular film seemed to be missing one, and I think it could have been more effective with a stronger storyline. It didn't help that it felt like it dragged on forever; I found myself eagerly waiting for it to end. Interestingly, it was only 123 minutes long, but it felt much longer to me. In addition to the lack of plot, the film also didn't have much notable conflict. \n\nIt's certainly not the worst movie I've seen, but it used to hold that spot for me until I watched \"The Fast And The Furious\". So, don't get the impression that my review comes from someone who just wants non-stop action. In fact, I generally don't enjoy most action films out today; this movie just felt like it was at the opposite end of the spectrum where not much happens. \n\nOn the bright side, the scenery and costumes were quite nice!",
    "This film boasts stunning visuals, but sadly lacks a cohesive storyline. For a plot to exist, there needs to be conflict, and this movie has none. It dedicates two hours to showcasing beautiful scenes without incorporating any significant action. While it aims for an artistic approach, it misses the essential elements of good storytelling.\n\nHowever, if you're a fan of Montana's landscapes and enjoy fly fishing, you'll appreciate the movie's aesthetic. Just be aware that it doesn't offer much in terms of narrative.",
    "This movie boasts stunning scenery but lacks a plot. Without conflict, it spends two hours painting a beautiful picture without any real activity. It tries to be artistic but neglects storytelling fundamentals. If you love Montana scenery and fly fishing, you'll find some value—just don't expect a story. There isn't one.",
    "I gave this movie a 1, which is the rating I reserve for films that make me either walk out or fall asleep. In this case, I fell asleep 10 minutes before it ended, feeling extremely bored and completely uninterested in what happened next.",
    "Mann captures the essence of the Alberta Rocky Mountains exquisitely through his photography, while Jimmy Stewart and Walter Brennan deliver consistently delightful performances.\n\nHowever, Hollywood's portrayal leaves much to be desired. The depiction of a Mountie advising the citizens of Dawson City, Yukon, to elect a marshal and take the law into their own hands, followed by gunfighters clashing in the streets for control, is highly inaccurate. \n\nSuch events never transpired on the Canadian side of the border during the Klondike gold rush. It appears that Mr. Mann and his team have conflated Dawson City with Deadwood, thereby confusing the Canadian North with the American Wild West.\n\nCanadian viewers should be prepared for an experience akin to the campy entertainment of \"Reefer Madness,\" either finding humor in the absurdity of the plot or shaking their heads in disbelief.",
    "This action Western, set in the scenic Northwest and starring James Stewart, features great scenery, costumes, and adventure. Stewart plays a wealthy cattleman up against a crooked government.\n\nHowever, Stewart's character is a stereotypical Hollywood cynic with few redeeming qualities, though he shows kindness to his partners, lending him some credibility. His otherwise piggish behavior makes it hard to care for him. \n\nNonetheless, the minor characters, including Walter Brennan, Royal Dano, and Harry Morgan, are quite enjoyable and make the film worth watching.",
    "This is the worst movie sequel ever. It's nonsensical, with the killer still murdering for fun—this time targeting people making a movie about the first film. It's utterly foolish.\n\nAvoid watching it if you value your time. You'll be left questioning the director's decisions. It fails to blend horror, action, and crime as the original did.\n\nDon't let children or teenagers watch it. It has a negative impact on viewers.",
    "Ah, Channel 5 of local Mexican TV! Every day, at 2:00 a.m., they air classic Horror movies from the 70's to early 2000's. Yesterday, they showed \"Return To Cabin By The Lake.\" I have to admit, I wasn't too thrilled after watching it.\n\nThe original \"Cabin By The Lake\" was a charmingly popular low-budget film and was quite well-received. However, this sequel didn't quite hit the mark. It lacks the unintentional humor of the original and seems like it's trying too hard to mimic it. The plot, unfortunately, doesn't make much sense.\n\nAt times, the movie comes across more like a soap opera with its over-the-top dialogues, cinematography, and direction.\n\nMy advice: you might want to skip this one. It's a film that probably won't be enjoyed by most, not even by fans of quirky, mediocre filmmaking.\n\nJust a heads up!",
    "Absurd follow-up strains believability immensely as the nefarious psychopath Stanley Kaldwell makes a comeback, this time infiltrating the film adaptation of his novel on garden drownings by impersonating a second unit director he assassinated.\n\nThe film mockingly skewers Hollywood with a cheeky script targeting domineering directors who engage in affairs with their actresses (..seeking career advancement) and detest any form of competition for the limelight. Brian Krause, who I found dreadful, hams it up so much that the satire feels overly exaggerated, plays the boisterous and moody director who resents his second unit director and screenplay writer, Alison (..played by Dahlia Salem), for seemingly taking over the production. Andrew Moxham is Paul Parsons, sibling to a victim from the first installment. The film's dark humor this time explores the notion of a serial killer directing a movie and milks this concept for all it's worth. Nelson effortlessly slides back into his maniacal role, with Stanley as cunning as ever, manipulating a film production and murdering anyone in his way to maintain total dominance over his project, until Alison uncovers his true identity. Alison is a driven writer eager to delve into Stanley's psyche to understand his motives, why he committed murder, and what led him down his sinister path. The irony of Alison working closely with the actual killer is central to the dark comedic aspect of this thriller. Predictably, a face-off between Alison and Stanley ensues, culminating in an utterly implausible and far-fetched resolution regarding the killer's destiny (..a tough pill to swallow). Unlike the first movie, which was sleekly polished, director Po-Chih Leong employs unnecessary techniques (..such as bizarre camera angles, slow-motion in sepia, and several scenes shot on video) that annoy rather than impress. This sequel, in my opinion, missed the mark compared to the original, with much of the humor being less effective and more blatant.",
    "\"Return to Cabin by the Lake was quite disappointing. The movie must have had a very low budget since part of it appears to be filmed with a simple video camera. This results in scenes that awkwardly mix movie-quality shots with those of amateur video, creating a very odd blend. They really should have avoided the 'home video' effect somehow.\n\nHowever, if you've seen the original Cabin by the Lake, it’s worth watching to compare and spot the differences. But if you haven't seen the original, this sequel might come across as too cheesy and could discourage you from ever giving the first one a chance.\"",
    "Considering this movie was made-for-TV, I'm not going to criticize it as harshly as I would a feature film. The script is below average, but it manages to be mildly humorous at times, whether intentionally or not. The acting is mostly exaggerated, which is common in many lower-budget movies.\n\nThe aspect of this movie that I truly disliked was that 90-95% of it is shot on film, but occasionally there will be 5-10 seconds where the footage is shot on video. This is noticeable because the video has less contrast, the colors are less vivid, and the footage runs at 30 frames per second instead of film's 24 frames per second. I suspect that these scenes were shot later due to budget constraints, which is disorienting and detracts from the film's overall quality.\n\nOverall, I've seen worse movies, but I can't say I enjoyed this one, and I wouldn't recommend anyone to watch it.",
    "Thinking of watching this movie? Think again. I rarely share my thoughts on what I watch, but this disaster compelled me to speak out. Not only was it a colossal waste of my time, but dissecting its flaws could take a lifetime—and frankly, it’s not worth it. Simply put, avoid this movie at all costs. It’s a black hole of wasted hours you’ll never get back. And those glowing reviews? Either the authors are completely clueless or on the studio’s payroll. Trust me, you'll regret every second spent on this train wreck!",
    "I watched this on the Sci-Fi channel, right after the first movie. For some reason, it kept me interested, though I’m not sure why.\n\n---SPOILERS--- The way the guy got involved in the movie was cheesy. In the first movie, he had a \"reason\" to kill people, but in this sequel, many of the killings made no sense. Stanley killed the director and captured the co-writer because of creative differences, but why try to kill the cast? No cast, no movie. He wanted it to \"look real when they died\"? If it’s a high-budget movie, use special effects. Like in the first one, the captured girl escapes, Stanley gets messed up, and disappears. Wow (sarcastic). This movie had potential, but the saddest part is, I would watch \"Cabin by the Lake 3,\" only because I like Judd Nelson. He's the best part of this sequel.",
    "I watched \"Cabin by the Lake\" this afternoon on USA, and for a made-for-TV movie, it was surprisingly engaging enough to make me curious about the sequel. So, I tuned in this evening, only to be sorely disappointed. While I didn't have high expectations, I was completely bewildered by the use of digital video (DV). The film could have been halfway decent if it weren't for those jarring digital shots that appeared out of nowhere. I anticipated some plot connection to these shots, but they seemed utterly pointless.\n\n(SPOILER ALERT!!) The open ending of the first \"Cabin by the Lake\" was acceptable, but the sequel's open ending was downright absurd. I can only imagine that the \"Return of Return to Cabin by the Lake\" would be watchable if it were the only option available, competing solely against late-night infomercials at 4 AM.",
    "A decent sequel, but it lacks the impact of the original. Judd Nelson plays a murderous screenwriter who adopts new identities to direct his novel, \"CABIN BY THE LAKE.\" Though there are still ruthless killings, the movie feels overly tongue-in-cheek and the humor falls flat. The film has a rushed quality, and Nelson's performance is often overdone. Ironically, it's about a script being rewritten before filming, which should have happened to this one.",
    "\"Return to Cabin by the Lake\" falls far short of its predecessor. Featuring only one returning main character, Stanley, this sequel isn't worth the two hours it demands. As a dedicated fan of the original film, which boasted a compelling storyline and strong performances, I find this follow-up sorely disappointing. It's reminiscent of the subpar sequels to \"Urban Legends\" and \"Blair Witch\" but suffers from even worse acting. The performances here are so poor that they pale in comparison to soap operas, eliciting more laughter than engagement. I strongly advise against watching this movie; it will only tarnish your memories of the first.",
    "I was really expecting Hedy Burress to return for part 2, especially since she managed to escape her watery fate in the first film. But it looks like that's not happening. Honestly, they should have given her a dramatic exit like in Friday The 13th Part 2—you know, something memorable.<br /><br />Just like Scream 3 and Urban Legend 2, this sequel tried the whole \"movie within a movie\" angle, and it was a complete disaster.<br /><br />This film was utter garbage. Seriously, that movie within a movie gimmick was terrible.<br /><br />Avoid this one at all costs!",
    "Viewers who are raving about every aspect of this film, including its opening credits, might lead you to think it's some kind of cinematic masterpiece. But believe me, folks, this is one of the most cringe-worthy films out there. If you're not laughing at it within the first five minutes, I’d say you've lost your sense of humor.\n\nDavid Niven stars as an RAF pilot full of bravado, who bizarrely decides to chat about love with a young, impressionable female air traffic controller while he's plummeting to what seems like a fiery death. (How romantic…) By a twist of fate, he survives and ends up on a beach right when the same air traffic controller happens to be bicycling by. (They instantly connect.)\n\nLooking beyond the strange homoerotic undertones (which are so exaggerated they should probably be called supertexts, including a naked boy playing flute on the beach and a flamboyant celestial messenger with overly-thick makeup), the most puzzling part of this movie is how it awkwardly uses national and racial stereotypes to try and make a point about the universal power of love. Spoiler alert: men in uniform like women in skirts and heels, who reciprocate, and apparently shedding a few tears can elevate a film to a ten-star rating on IMDb…\n\nIn terms of production quality, the continuity and editing are cringe-worthy, while the lighting might be even worse, though the terrible script hardly leaves you time to notice. The film plays around with Technicolor effects (heaven is depicted in black and white), foreshadowing (so laughable that my usually appreciative movie companion cheered and laughed when a doc’s motorcycle finally crashed), and freeze-motion scenes (particularly hilarious as the female lead struggles to stay still, undoubtedly amusing the off-camera crew).\n\nThe best scenes are the early beach shots, but it's a steep decline from there. The moving staircase (resembling an escalator) is no match for the iconic Odessa Steps, to put it mildly. I'd advise against feeling obligated to watch this feeble attempt at filmmaking. The movie is so bad that it’s amusing, and that’s probably the highest praise I can give it."
