    "Futures contracts are a member of a larger class of financial assets called derivatives. Derivatives are called such because their payoffs depend on the price of other assets (financial or real). Other kinds of derivatives are call options, put options. Fixed income assets that mimic the behavior of derivatives are callable bonds, puttable bonds etc.  A futures contract is a contract that specifies the following: Just like with any other contract, there are two parties involved. One party commits to delivering the underlying asset to the other party on expiration date in exchange for the futures price. The other party commits to paying the futures price in exchange for the asset. There is no price that any of the two parties pay upfront to engage in the contract. The language used is so that the agent committing to receiving the delivery of the underlying asset is said to have bought the contract. The agent that commits to make the delivery is said to have sold the contract.  So answer your question, buying on June 1 a futures contract at the futures price of $100, with a maturity date on August 1 means you commit to paying $100 for the underlying asset on August 1. You don't have to pay anything upfront. Futures price is simply what the contract prescribes the underlying asset will exchange hands for.",

    "\"At any given moment, one can tally the numbers used for NAV. It's math, and little more. The Market Cap, which as you understand is a result of share value. Share value (stock price) is what the market will pay today for the shares. It's not only based on NAV today, but on future expectations. And expectations aren't the same for each of us. Which is why there are always sellers for the buyers of a stock, and vice-versa.  From your question, we agree that NAV can be measured, it's the result of adding up things that are all known. (For now, let's ignore things such as \"\"goodwill.\"\") Rarely is a stock price simply equal to the NAV divided by the number of shares. Often, it's quite higher. The simplest way to look at it is that the stock price not only reflects the NAV, but investors' expectations looking into the future.  If you look for two companies with identical NAV per share but quite different share prices, you'll see that the companies differ in that one might be a high growth company, the other, a solid one but with a market that's not in such a growth mode.\"",
    "Chinese suppliers can quote their price in CNY rather than USD (as has been typical), and thus avoid the exchange risk from US dollar volatility- the CNY has been generally appreciating so committing to receive payments in US dollars when their costs are in CNY means they are typically on the losing end of the equation and they have to pad their prices a bit.  Canadian importers will have to buy RMB (typically with CAD) to pay for their orders and Canadian exporters can take payment in RMB if they wish, or set prices in CAD. By avoiding the US dollar middleman the transactions are made less risky and incur less costs. Japan did this many decades ago (they, too, used to price their products in USD).  This is important in transactions of large amounts, not so much for the tiny amounts associated with tourism. Two-way annual trade between China and Canada is in excess of $70bn.  Of course Forex trading may greatly exceed the actual amounts required for trade- the world Forex market is at least an order of magnitude greater than size of real international trade.

    "\"I read the post.  I read what **they said** about it.   Yet, that part makes **no sense**.  They keep talking about \"\"only avilable to members of the Florida Bar\"\" but stop and think about how that doesn't make sense.  Are they in a *florida* court or in a *federal* court?  Or an IP/administrative setting?    Some things they wrote suggests they're in a *federal* court.  But others things suggest they're in an administrative court related to IP.  For example, they talk about needing an attorney who can represent them in the Trademark/IP courts.  That sounds like patent prosecution - but that's typically just about getting the patent/IP stuff in the first place - and not so much after-the-fact stuff.  But then again, I'm not at all familiar with the area so I could be way off base.  The problem is: I shouldn't have to be speculating so much because their story sucked.  But patent litigation (for infringement for example) as far as I was aware, occurs in traditional district courts and so far as I am aware you don't need a special trademark/ip exam to sue on it.  By contrast, patent *prosecution*, which is getting a patent through the offices, requires that the attorney take the USPTO exam - to become a 'patent' attorney.  [link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USPTO_registration_examination).  Federal courts, if that's where they are, typically use PACER ECF/CM (case management web portal).

    "My super fund and I would say many other funds give you one free switch of strategies per year.  Some suggest you should change from high growth option to a more balance option once you are say about 10 to 15 years from retirement, and then change to a more capital guaranteed option a few years from retirement. This is a more passive approach and has benefits as well as disadvantages. The benefit is that there is not much work involved, you just change your investment option based on your life stage, 2 to 3 times during your lifetime. This allows you to take more risk when you are young to aim for higher returns, take a balanced approach with moderate risk and returns during the middle part of your working life, and take less risk with lower returns (above inflation) during the latter part of your working life. A possible disadvantage of this strategy is you may be in the higher risk/ higher growth option during a market correction and then change to a more balanced option just when the market starts to pick up again. So your funds will be hit with large losses whilst the market is in retreat and just when things look to be getting better you change to a more balanced portfolio and miss out on the big gains. A second more active approach would be to track the market and change investment option as the market changes. One approach which shouldn't take much time is to track the index such as the ASX200 (if you investment option is mainly invested in the Australian stock market) with a 200 day Simple Moving Average (SMA). The concept is that if the index crosses above the 200 day SMA the market is bullish and if it crosses below it is bearish. See the chart below:  This strategy will work well when the market is trending up or down but not very well when the market is going sideways, as you will be changing from aggressive to balanced and back too often. Possibly a more appropriate option would be a combination of the two. Use the first passive approach to change investment option from aggressive to balanced to capital guaranteed with your life stages, however use the second active approach to time the change. For example, if you were say in your late 40s now and were looking to change from aggressive to balanced in the near future, you could wait until the ASX200 crosses below the 200 day SMA before making the change. This way you could capture the majority of the uptrend (which could go on for years) before changing from the high growth/aggressive option to the balanced option. If you where after more control over your superannuation assets another option open to you is to start a SMSF, however I would recommend having at least $300K to $400K in assets before starting a SMSF, or else the annual costs would be too high as a percentage of your total super assets.",

    "First, to answer the question.  The benefit of a 401k is that you don't have to pay income tax on the money contributed nor do you pay capital gains tax on the money that accumulates.  You get that with the restriction that you can't willy nilly remove and contribute money to the account (and you are taxed on withdrawals, more severely if you do it before you are 65).  Similar sorts of restrictions apply to all retirement accounts which give tax benefits.  Now, for the 7000 not providing benefit.  Assuming a very modest 4% growth, over 40 years 7000 becomes 34,671. Not something to sneeze at (inflation, risk reward, blah, blah, blah, it is less than it looks, but 4% is really pretty low, the stock market averages anywhere from 7-&gt;10% and IIRC the bond market is somewhere around 5%).  Now, certainly, to avoid bankruptcy you should withdraw.  However, if it is possible, you will be best served by keeping the money in your 401k account.

    "The details of the 401(k) are critical to the decision. A high cost (the expenses charged within the) 401(k) - I would deposit only to the match, and I'd be sure to get the entire match offered. In which case, that $3000 might be good to have available if you start out with a tight budget.  Low cost 401(k) w/match - a no-brainer, deposit what you can afford.

    "\"Based on the conversations in the comments, I believe a pragmatic solution would be the best immediate course of action, while still working on the long term addiction issues. The first step is to get your husband to agree to give you all of his credit cards and let you manage the money for a set period of time, say 3 months, to see how it goes. (In my experience people are more likely to agree to being uncomfortable for a finite period of time, rather than indefinitely.) Step 2 is to provide him a means for making purchases on his own, but with a limited budget. Here are some examples: Perhaps a combination of the above options would work best. Another thing to consider is to set up alerts with your bank so that you are notified of certain purchases (or all) that are made by your husband. This varies by bank, but nowadays most will allow you to receive text/email immediately when the purchase happens, and can be set to certain amounts or categories. There is a definite psychological difference between, \"\"If I buy this, my spouse will find out at the end of the month and berate me.\"\" and \"\"If I buy this, my spouse is going to run in here in 30 seconds and berate me.\"\" The latter might actually be a deterrent on its own, and you may likely have the opportunity to undo the purchase if you wish to. As a side note, it's important to realize that the above suggestions are still allowing for some limited amount of enabling and temptation to occur. If the addiction is such that it is hazardous to one's health (for example drugs or alcohol addiction), then I don't believe this would be the best course of action. These suggestions are based on my impression that the biggest concern at the moment is financial, and I believe these ideas help to mitigate that. Good luck.\"",

    "So does a post-dated check have any valid use in a business or   personal transaction? Does it provide any financial or legal   protections at all? Yes, most definitely. You're writing a future date on the check, not past, to ensure that the check will not be deposited before that day. Keep in mind that this may change from place to place, since not every country has the same rules. In the US, for example, such trick would not work since the check may be presented any time and is not a limited obligation. However, in some other countries banks will not pay a check presented before the date written on it. While in the US the date on the check is the date on which it was (supposedly) written and as such is meaningless for obligation purposes, in many other countries the date on the check is the date on which the payment to be made, thus constitutes the start of the commitment and payment will not be made before that date. For example, in Canada: If you write a post-dated cheque, under the clearing rules of the   Canadian Payments Association (CPA), your cheque should not be cashed   before the date that is written on it. If the post-dated cheque is cashed early, you can ask your financial   institution to put the money back into your account up to the day   before the cheque should have been cashed.",

I'd have to log in to their site to find the cost of a \"\"bid\"\" for packages, but you can multiply the cost of a single \"\"bid\"\" by 2,118, add another £21.18, and you'll know what all \"\"bidders\"\" trying to receive this item paid - I'll bet the total is substantially more than £249.  People taking part in these scams obviously convince themselves that they are the \"\"clever\"\" ones who will get an item cheaply. Apart from the possibility that a single \"\"bidder\"\" can easily make more bids than the value of the item, if you think you are more clever than everyone else, you are kidding yourself. (If you think you are indeed more clever than everyone else, go ahead and donate your money to these companies).  The \"\"packages\"\" are most likely designed to give you the false impression that you get some value for money. Years ago when I checked a single bid was £1, but in bigger packages the bids would cost say 50 pence. They also want many bidders to make sure the number of bids will be high (although there is nothing other than the website's honesty that prevents them from automatically adding bids if an item would otherwise sell too cheap).  Just to clarify: These are not auction sites. In an auction, the highest bidder pays the price they bid, usually plus some commission (on eBay, the commission is paid by the seller), and gets the goods, while everyone else keeps their money. In this \"\"auction\"\", every bid costs money, and by increasing the bid by one penny each time they make sure there are usually thousands of bids. (They also offer the products at a \"\"reduced\"\" price if you don't \"\"win\"\" the auction; the reduced price is substantially higher than buying from the manufacturer or any reputable retailer directly).\"",

This supports the link between THC concentration and neurocognitive dysfunction. Residual effects, however, continued in subjects who no longer felt the drug's effect.

    "For the US government, they've just credited Person B with a Million USD and haven't gained anything (afterall, those digits are intangible and don't really have a value, IMO). Two flaws in this reasoning: The US government didn't do anything. The receiving bank credited the recipient. If the digits are intangible, such that they haven't gained anything, they haven't lost anything either. In practice, the role of governments in the transfer is purely supervisory. The sending bank debits the sender's account and the receiving bank credits the recipient's account. Every intermediary makes some money on this transaction because the cost to the sender exceeds the credit to the recipient. The sending bank typically receives a credit to their account at a correspondent bank. The receiving bank typically receives a debit from their account at a correspondent bank. If a bank sends lots of money, eventually its account at its correspondent will run dry. If a bank receives lots of money, eventually its account at its correspondent will have too much money. This is resolved with domestic payments, sometimes handled by governmental or quasi-governmental agencies. In the US, banks have an account with the federal reserve and adjust balances there. The international component is handled by the correspondent bank(s). They also internally will credit and debit. If they get an imbalance between two currencies they can't easily correct, they will have to sell one currency to buy the other. Fortunately, worldwide currency exchange is extremely efficient.",

    "\"I used to work for one of the three ratings agencies. Awhile ago. First: There are lots of different ratings. The bulk of ratings are for corporate debt and public finance. So senior debentures (fixed income) and General Obligations e.g. tax-free muni bonds, respectively. Ratings agencies are NOT paid by the investment banks, they are paid by the corporations  or city/ state that is issuing debt. The investment banks are the syndicate that pulls the transaction together and brings it to market.  For mortgage-backed securities, collateralized debt CDO-CLO's, all of which are fancy structured securitizations, well, that is a different matter! Those  transactions are the ones where there is an inappropriately close tie between the investment bankers and ratings agencies. And those were the ratings that blew out and caused problems.  Ratings agencies continued to do a decent job with what WAS their traditional business, corporate and municipal bond ratings, as far as I know.   What khajja said was 100% correct: S&amp;P's fees were paid by investors, the people who were purchasing the bonds, until about 50 years ago. Around the same time that McGraw-Hill purchased S&amp;P, in 1966, they departed from that model, and started charging the bond issuers for ratings. I don't know if that decision was driven by McGraw-Hill or not, though.  One more thing: Not all credit ratings agencies are paid by the issuers. One of the 10 NRSRO's (a designation given by the S.E.C.) is Egan-Jones. Their revenue comes from the investors, bond purchasers, not the companies issuing bonds, unlike the S&amp;P/ Fitch/ Moody's \"\"business model\"\". So there is an alternative, which I consider hopeful and reason not to totally despair.  EDIT: What xcrunna19 mentions is also totally accurate. The part about Nouriel Roubini (who is a professor at N.Y.U. or Columbia or such and a sensible though slightly high strung sort) is consistent with my impression. As for whether it would require government action to implement the changes advocated by Roubini, yes, I guess it would, but I don't know if the government would do that. It would be better if the credit ratings agencies would find their own way to a different, less conflicted payment-incentive model.  Keep in mind too that many of the provisions of Dodd-Frank have removed the existing regulatory requirements for credit ratings on bonds and other securities. This is the scary part though: There isn't anything to replace the credit ratings agencies, not at the moment, as far as I can tell! Eventually the government is supposed to come up with an alternative, but that hasn't happened yet. Which is better: Not requiring ratings at all, or the past situation of sometimes inflated ratings, which imparted a false sense of confidence? I don't know.\"",

    "I believe this argument is most often used when considering which debts to pay back first, or when there are other options available such as investment options, building up an emergency fund, or saving for a large purchase.  In that case, it's simply justifying making minimum payments and paying more over the life of the loan in exchange for larger liquidity in the present. Unfortunately, when it comes to choosing between which debts to pay (e.g. My mom pays more than the minimum on her car because she can't deduct auto loan interest, despite her mortgage carrying a higher interest rate), it's only beneficial if the tax savings offsets the interest savings difference. The formula for that is: tax bracket > (1 - (target loan interest rate / mortgage interest rate)) That said, most people don't think in the long term, either by natural shortsightedness, or by necessity (need to have an emergency fund).",

It's what yahoo told me, but other sources are saying that the beta of KORS is more like -0.01 or close to 0. Yes?   edit 2: Using -0.01 beta, I get a rdWACC of 2.2%. Now this seems more plausible.

You can claim it is all you want, but until you prove its faulty its not. And you yet to prove its actually faulty.   It's a sweeping generalization.

    "\"The question asked in your last paragraph (what's the downside) is answered simply; if you take out a loan and close the cards, that's a ding on your score because your leverage ratio on this portion of your credit jumps to 100% or more, and because you'll be reducing the average age of your lines of credit (one line of credit a few days old versus five lines of credit several years old each). If you take out the loan and don't close the accounts, it's one more line of credit, increasing your total credit, lowering your leverage, but making institutions more reluctant to give you any more credit until they see what you'll do with what you have. In either case, assuming you can get the loan at less than the average rate of the cards (that's actually not a guarantee; a lot of lenders will want APRs in the 20s or 30s even for a title loan or other collateralized loan), then your cost of capital will also go down. That gives you more of a gap of discretionary income that you can better use to \"\"snowball\"\" all this debt as you are planning. Another thing to keep in mind is that the minimum payment changes as the balance does. The minimum payment covers monthly interest at least, and therefore varies based on your interest rate (usually variable) and your balance (which will hopefully be decreasing). A constant payment over the current minimum, much like a more traditional amortization, would be preferable.\"",

When options are issued, they usually do have an expiration date by which you need to exercise if you want to buy the shares. There may be other conditions attached. For instance, whether the plan is about stocks or options, often there is a vesting schedule that determines when you become eligible to buy or exercise. When you buy the shares, they may be registered directly in your name (you might get a fancy certificate), or they may be deposited in an account in your name.

    "When you want to short a stock, you are trying to sell shares (that you are borrowing from your broker), therefore you need buyers for the shares you are selling.  The ask prices represent people who are trying to sell shares, and the bid prices represent people who are trying to buy shares. Using your example, you could put in a limit order to short (sell) 1000 shares at $3.01, meaning that your order would become the ask price at $3.01.  There is an ask price ahead of you for 500 shares at $3.00.  So people would have to buy those 500 shares at $3.00 before anyone could buy your 1000 shares at $3.01. But it's possible that your order to sell 1000 shares at $3.01 never gets filled, if the buyers don't buy all the shares ahead of you.  The price could drop to $1.00 without hitting $3.01 and you will have missed out on the trade. If you really wanted to short 1000 shares, you could use a market order.  Let's say there's a bid for 750 shares at $2.50, and another bid for 250 shares at $2.49.  If you entered a market order to sell 1000 shares, your order would get filled at the best bid prices, so first you would sell 750 shares at $2.50 and then you would sell 250 shares at $2.49. I was just using your example to explain things.  In reality there won't be such a wide spread between the bid and ask prices.  A stock might have a bid price of $10.50 and an ask price of $10.51, so there would only be a 1 cent difference between putting in a limit order to sell 1000 shares at $10.51 and just using a market order to sell 1000 shares and getting them filled at $10.50. Also, your example probably wouldn't work in real life, because brokers typically don't allow people to short stocks that are trading under $5 per share. As for your question about how often you are unable to make a short sale, it can sometimes happen with stocks that are heavily shorted and your broker may not be able to find any more shares to borrow. Also remember that you can only short stocks with a margin account, you cannot short stocks with a cash account.",
    "Disputing the remark seems unlikely to move your score, since it is just that -- a remark.  It's hard to say whether the scoring models can/do read the remarks and incorporate them (somehow) into the scoring metric itself.

In other words, is it showing as an open collection or some other status which would indicate the creditor still has a pending claim?  If so, disputing it might have some effect, although nobody would be able to tell you for certain or even how much your score might be affected. If, as you say, that account should have been part of the bankruptcy package then getting that corrected could be important enough to achieve what you're looking for.

The outstanding principal is the amount left or remaining balance. A program like GnuCash or Quicken makes doing the payment schedule, and applying payments relatively easy to handle.  Spreadsheets will require you to have 36 lines (3 years x 12 months) of payment and recalculation detail, but that shouldn't be too much work.

Once you have your emergency fund started, budget at least enough toward your 401k to capture any matching offered by your employer. Then use the snowball plan to pay off your debts.  (From what your post says, this does not apply to you, but you may have some small credit card debts taht were not discussed).  Earmark the 'extra' for the smallest debt first.  When that debt is paid, the 'extra' grows by the minimum payment of the smallest.  Thus the snowball grows as you pay off debts. Once the debts are gone, reward yourself, within reason (and without going into debt). Now shift your extra into fully funding your retirement savings.  Consult a financial advisor to help you plan how to distribute your retirement savings across the available retirement savings types.  They can explain why it's good to have some of your retirement savings funded from after tax income.  They can help you find the balance between pre- and post-tax funded accounts.   Eventually, you may come to the point where you're putting the max allowed into your tax advantaged retirement accounts.  At your age, this is a significant achievement.

As a frequent traveller, I recommend that you build some flexibility into your plans, especially during the winter. It is not always possible, but try not to need to be somewhere the day of or the day after your flight.  Try to book flights early in the day, as they are less likely to be delayed by problems in flights before them, and you have more options for rebooking.

    "\"From what I've heard in the past, debt can be differentiated between secured debt and unsecured debt.   Secured debt is a debt for which something stands good such as a mortgage on your house.  You have a debt, but that debt is covered by the value of an asset and if you needed to free yourself of the debt, then you could by selling that asset.   This is what is known as \"\"good\"\" debt.   Unsecured debt is debt that is incurred where the only thing that is available to pay it back is your income.  An example of this is credit card debt where you purchase something that couldn't be sold again to pay off the debt.   This is know as \"\"bad\"\" debt. You have to be careful about thinking that house debt is always \"\"good\"\" debt because the house stands good for it though.  The problem with that is that the house could go down in value and then suddenly your \"\"good\"\" debt is \"\"bad\"\" debt (or no longer secured).  Cars are very risky this way because they go down in value.  It is really easy to get a car loan where before long you are upside down.    This is the problem with the term \"\"good\"\" debt. The label makes it sound like it is a good idea to have that debt, and the risk associated with having the debt is trivialized and allows yourself to feel good about your financial plan.  Perhaps this is why so many houses are in foreclosure right now, people believed the \"\"good\"\" debt myth and thought that it was ok to borrow MORE than the home was worth to get into a house.  Thus they turned a secured debt into an unsecured debt and put their residence at risk by levels of debt they couldn't afford. Other advice I've heard and tend to agree with, is that you should only borrow for a house, an education and maybe a car (danger on that last one), being careful to buy a modest house, car etc that is well within your means to repay.   So if you do have to borrow for a car, go for basic transportation instead of the $40,000 BMW.  Keep you house payment less than 1/4th of your take home pay. Pay off the school loans as quickly as possible. Regardless of the label, \"\"good\"\" \"\"bad\"\" \"\"unsecured\"\" \"\"secured\"\", I think that less debt is better than more debt.   There is definitely such a thing as too much \"\"good\"\" debt!\"",
    "I am not a lawyer, but the big thing to consider would be how you would split the money should either of you decide you want to close the account (or, at least her/his portion of the account).  I suspect you'd also need to determine how to split the capital gains/losses for tax purposes.  I can't really see any benefit to a joint account, unless you needed her money to qualify for some of the lower cost funds, and even then the difference in cost would be fairly low, much lower than the cost of having to potentially hire a lawyer to sort out all the questions.",
    "\"Not knowing anything about your situation or what makes it so complex, I would have to agree with the other commenters.  If your accountant screws up your business goes under, but at least your personal finances are safe from that and you'll recover (unless all your wealth is tied up in your business).

Have you set up online bill pay with your bank, so that you can automatically pay all the bills when they arrive?

Again, I don't know your exact situation, but hopefully some of these suggestions help.  Once I started automating my savings and a lot of my bill paying, it gave me a lot of peace of mind.\"",

That being said, there are scenarios like what Peter K. mentioned in his comment, where you're purchasing the building and business outright, but the land it sits on is actually being leased from a separate land-owner.  You may also be seeing the business itself being offered as freehold or leasehold. In this case, you may be purchasing the business of the pub from a pub company, but the building the pub resides in is leased from a property owner.

If that were the case, then, well, I doubt the management would think the UK branch is operating on a healthy basis.  Also, the point the article is trying to make is the losses are *not* just from expansion into the market. No, Starbucks in the UK is healthy and profitable, and the debt costs are inflated by bringing in debt from abroad; debt that has nothing to do with the operating and expansion costs made in the UK, and yet it lowers their tax rate.  This moving around of debt is a scheme only suitable for large multinationals, and I think it's very fair to ask if your tax system should allow such practices.

    "Yes, it's a risk. To put it in perspective, If we look at the data for S&P returns since 1871, we get a CAGR of 10.72%. But, that comes with a SDev (Standard deviation) of 18.67%. This results in 53 of the 146 years returning less than 4%.  Now if we repeat the exercise over rolling 8 year periods, the CAGR drops to 9.22%, but the SDev drops to 5.74%. This results in just 31 of the 139 periods returning less than 4%. On the flip side, 26 periods had an 8 year return of over 15% CAGR.  From the anti-DS article you linked, I see that you like a good analogy. For me, the returns of the S&P over the long term are like going to Vegas, and finding that after you run the math of their craps (dice rolling game) you find the expected return is 10%. You can still lose on a given roll. But over a series of a larger number of rolls, you're far ahead.  To D Stanley - I agree that returns are not quite normal, but they are not so far off. Of the 139 rolling returns, we'd expect about 68% or 95 results to be 1 SDev away. We get 88 returns +/-1SDev. 2 SDevs? We'd expect only 5% to lie outside this range, and in fact, I only get one result on the low side and 4 on the high side, 5 results vs the 7 total we'd expect.

Since it's the same asset, its value should not vary across exchanges once you compensate for exchange rates, right?

Your second question concerns the -19% return calculated for the second quarter.  You seem to think this return is \"\"way-off\"\".  Not really.

Therefore, if I started with $100,000, added $10,000 in cash to the account, and ended up with $100,000 in my account, then my return would be a negative value since I lost the $10,000 that I deposited in the account.

    "\"Yes, your tax bracket is 25%.  However, that doesn't mean that your take home pay will be 75% of your salary.  There is much more that goes into figuring out what your take home pay will be. First, you have payroll taxes.  This is often listed on your pay stub as \"\"FICA.\"\"  The Social Security portion of this tax is 6.2% on the first $118,500 of your pay and the Medicare portion is another 1.45% on the first $200,000.  (Your employer also has to pay additional tax that does not appear on your stub.)  So 7.65% of your salary gets removed off the top. In addition to the federal income taxes that get withheld, you may also have state income taxes that get withheld.  The amount varies with each state. Also, the 25% tax bracket does not mean that your tax is 25% of your entire salary.  You step through the tax brackets as your income goes up.  So part of your salary is taxed at 10%, part at 15%, and the remainder is at 25%. The amount of federal income tax that is withheld from your paycheck is really a rough estimate of how much tax you actually owe.  There are lots of things that can reduce your tax liability (personal exemptions, deductions, credits) or increase your tax (investment income, penalties).

    "\"It's not usually apparent to the average consumer, but there's actually two stages to collecting a payment, and two ways to undo it.  The particular combination that occurs may lead to long refund times, on top of any human delays (like Ben Miller's answer addresses). When you pay with a credit card, it is typically only authorized - the issuing bank says \"\"I'm setting this money aside for this transaction\"\", but no money actually changes hands.  You'll typically see this on your statement as a \"\"pending\"\" charge.  Only later, in a process called \"\"settlement\"\", does your bank actually send money to the merchant's bank.  Typically, this process starts the same day that the authorization happens (at close of business), but it may take a few days to complete.  In the case of an ecommerce transaction, the merchant may not be allowed to start it until they ship whatever you ordered. On the flip side, a given transaction can be voided off or money can be sent back to your card.  In the first case, the transaction will just disappear altogether; in the second, it may disappear or you may see both the payment and the refund on your statement.  Voids can be as fast as an authorization, but once a transaction has started settlement, it can't be voided any more.  Sending money back (a \"\"refund\"\") goes through the same settlement process as above, and can take just as long.

    "\"While I agree that highly processed foods, including plant based meat substitutes, are probably not the best things we could be eating, damning them with scare words like \"\"chemicals\"\" is unhelpful and certainly doesn't account for the bigger picture.  All food is made of chemicals- water is a chemical, broccoli is full of various chemicals.  Looking at the specific nutritional profile of meat alternatives most of them fall somewhere between marginally better and no worse than meat based foods.  Getting protein from leafy greens, whole grains, nuts, and legumes would probably be better, but meat alternatives still make it easier for people to adopt plant based diets, and see them as viable, which is likely to have a positive health impact, or again at least be no worse than an omnivorous diet.  You also discount the non-health related reasons that people choose these options.  Many people may be choosing meat alternatives because of concerns over animal welfare or the environment.  Other people may simply like the taste- many options are different enough from meat to not be comparable from a taste standpoint, and many plant based meat alternatives are much better tasting than similar frozen convenience foods made from animals.\"",

    "My perspective is from the US. Many employers offer 401(k)s and you can always contribute to an IRA for either tax deferred or tax free investment growth. If you're company offers a 401(k) match you should always contribute the maximum amount they max or you're leaving money on the table.    Companies can't always support pensions and it isn't the best idea to rely on one entirely for retirement unless your pension is from the federal government.   Even states such as Illinois are going through extreme financial difficulties due to pension funding issues. It's only going to get worse and if you think pension benefit accrual isn't going to be cut eventually you'll have another thing coming. I'd be worried if I was a state employee in the middle of my career with no retirement savings outside of my pension.   Ranting: Employees pushed hard for some pretty absurd commitments and public officials let the public down by giving in. It seems a little crazy to me that someone can work for the state until they're in their 50's and then earn 70% of their 6 figure salary for the rest of their life. Something needs to be done but I'd be surprised if anyone has the political will to make tough choices now before thee options get much much worse and these states are forced to make a decision.",
    "If the IRA is costing you $100 a year, you should almost certainly transfer it to a cheaper provider, regardless of whether you're going to withdraw anything.  You can transfer the IRA to another provider that doesn't charge you the fees.  Or you can convert it to Roth and combine it with your existing Roth.  Either way, you will keep all the money, and save $100 per year in the future. If you want to take money out of your retirement accounts, you should take it out of your Roth IRA, because you can withdraw contributions (i.e., up to the amount you contributed) from the Roth without tax or penalty. Whether you should withdraw anything from your retirement accounts is a different question.  If you're already maxing out your Roth IRA, and you have sufficient retirement savings, you could just instead plow that $5500 into your student loans.  (If you can afford it, of course, it'd be better to just pay the $7500 from your income and still contribute to the retirement accounts.)

    "If the check is written as a check to BigCo, it is less clear how Jack can compensate himself for the equity sale. It is as if the equity was owned by the corporation, not by Jack. This is correct.  If the check is written to BigCo, then it is BigCo issuing new shares.  Jack doesn't compensate himself for the equity sale, as he didn't sell anything.  The company traded shares for money which it uses for expansion.  In the long term, the capital gain from expansion may exceed the value of a $200,000 no-interest loan to the company.   If the value of the company before investing $250,000 is $1 million, then the value after investing is $1.25 million.  So $250,000 is 20% of the value of the company.  BigCo should not give the buyer 25% of BigCo but only 20% in that example.  If it does give 25%, the buyer is getting a $312,500 stake for only $250,000.   With the other example, Jack sells 25% of the company for $250,000 from his personal shares.  This doesn't change the assessed value of the company, just Jack's stake.  Jack then loans the company $200,000.  This also doesn't change the assessed value of the company (at least in theory).  It gains $200,000 but has an offsetting debt of $200,000.  In net, that's no change.  Assets and liabilities balance the same.   So if you know that the assessed value of the company is $1 million and that the buyer is paying $250,000 for a 25% stake at that same valuation, then you know that the check is being written to Jack.  If the check is written to BigCo, then one or more of those numbers is incorrect.   The buyer could be getting a 20% stake.  The new value of the company after the investment is $1.25 million.   Or paying $333,333.33.  The new value of the company after the investment is $1,333,333.33.   Or BigCo could only be worth $750,000 before the investment.  The new value of the company after the investment is $1 million.   Or Jack is getting screwed, selling $312,500 in stock (25%) for only $250,000.  Jack's shares drop from being worth $1 million to only $937,500.  The value of the company is $1.25 million.   Or some combination of smaller changes that balances.",

    "Usually that is the case that when fixed rates are lower than the variable rates, it is an indication that the banks feel the next movement in rates could be down. You also need to look at the fixed rates for different periods, for example 1 year fixed compared to 3 year fixed and 5 year fixed rates. If you find the 3 and 5 year fixed rates are higher than the 1 year fixed rates this could be an indication that the banks feel rates will fall in the short term but the falls won't last long and will continue to rise after a year or so. If the 3 year fixed rates are also low in comparison, then the banks may feel that the economy is heading for a longer term down trend. The banks won't want to lose out, so will change their fixed rates on their perception of where they feel the economy is headed. Since your post in May 2011, the standard variable rate has since dropped twice (in November and December) to be at 7.30%. You will also find that fixed rates have also been dropped further by the banks, indicating additional future cuts in the variable rates. Regards, Victor",

    "If your uncle is looking to maintain life insurance coverage for specific shorter period of time he may want to look into hybrid life insurance. If you buy a hybrid universal life policy, the premium and death benefit can be guaranteed to last until any age. Since, most permanent policies focus on cash value accumulation it is hard for most people to find cheap whole life or affordable universal life. Consumers only looking for a longer duration have a more flexible choice with a new hybrid product that combines elements of both term life coverage and universal life. Hybrid universal  policies are much cheaper then other permanent coverage such as whole life coverage because they do not emphasize cash value accumulation. However, the premiums and death benefits can still be guaranteed to a specific age (i.e. 85, 90, 95, 100). So, premiums can be scaled to coordinate with your desired budget and the face amount required for your family. Typical universal life and whole life insurance contracts only allow for lifetime coverage. However, hybrid universal life offers a much smaller premium because the coverage can be dialed into a specific age. If the policyholder does live beyond the originally selected age, the death benefit will simply begin getting smaller, while the original premium will  continue to remain the same.",
    "20% is almost certainly too high. I agree with 2%, as a very rough rule. It will vary significantly depending on the industry. I generally calculate an average of the previous 2-3 years working capital, and deduct that from cash. Working capital is Current Assets less Current Liabilities. Current Assets is comprised of cash, prepaid expenses, and significantly, accounts receivable. This means that CA is likely to be much higher than just cash, which leaves more excess cash after liabilities are deducted. Which reduces EV, which makes the EV/EBITDA ratio look even more pricey, as Dimitri noted. But a balance sheet is just a snapshot of the final day of the quarter.

    "The answer to this question is related to another question: How would I invest in Uber? Given that Uber is a privately-held company, the average investor cannot directly buy stock.  However, there are some indirect methods that you can use to invest in Uber, and as a result, it is also possible to indirectly short Uber. One method is to invest in (or short) companies that invest in Uber.  Alphabet/Google (GOOG) owns some, as well as Microsoft (MSFT), Toyota (ADR), and other companies.  Theoretically, you could short these companies, as a hit to Uber would be bad for those companies. Another method would be to look at Uber's competitors.  Think about what companies would do well if Uber went under.  Lyft, perhaps, although it is so similar to Uber that if one has trouble, the other may as well.  Perhaps instead you might invest in a traditional taxi company, or a company that provides services to taxi companies, such as Medallion Financial Corporation (MFIN). Keep in mind that either investing or shorting any of these is not really the same as investing/shorting Uber.  It provides you some exposure in Uber, but your investment is also affected by many other things that have nothing to do with Uber.

The party committing to receive the underlying asset is said to have \"bought\" the contract, while the party committing to deliver the asset is said to have \"sold\" the contract.\n\nTo illustrate, purchasing a futures contract on June 1 with a futures price of $100 and a maturity date of August 1 means that you are committing to pay $100 for the underlying asset on August 1.

To illustrate, let's consider a scenario where you're exchanging 100 units of US Dollars to British Pounds, with a current conversion rate of 1 USD = 0.82 GBP. To accurately calculate the exchange rate, you must factor in the 3% deduction, which reduces the actual currency rate to 97%.

    "Calculating a company's Net Asset Value (NAV) is a straightforward mathematical exercise. However, the Market Capitalization, which is derived from the share value, is a different story. Share value, or stock price, reflects what investors are willing to pay for a share today, and it's influenced by their expectations for the company's future performance. These expectations vary from person to person, which is why there are always buyers and sellers in the market.\n\nWhile NAV can be precisely measured by adding up known values, the stock price rarely equals the NAV divided by the number of shares. In fact, it's often significantly higher. This is because the stock price not only reflects the company's current NAV but also investors' future expectations.\n\nTo illustrate this point, consider two companies with identical NAV per share but different share prices. The difference lies in their growth prospects. One company may be a high-growth business, while the other is a stable company operating in a slower-growing market.",

For example, you might switch from a high-growth option to a more balanced option around 10-15 years from retirement, and then to a capital-guaranteed option a few years before retiring. This passive approach has its benefits and drawbacks.\n\nOn the plus side, it's relatively low-maintenance, requiring only 2-3 changes during your lifetime. This allows you to take on more risk when you're young to aim for higher returns, adopt a balanced approach during your working life, and reduce risk as you near retirement. However, a potential disadvantage is that you may be in a high-risk option during a market correction, only to switch to a more balanced option just as the market starts to recover, missing out on potential gains.\n\nA more active approach is to track the market and adjust your investment option accordingly. One simple strategy is to follow the ASX200 index with a 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). When the index crosses above the SMA, it's a bullish signal, and when it crosses below, it's bearish. While this approach works well in trending markets, it can be less effective in sideways markets, where you may end up switching options too frequently.\n\nA potentially more effective approach is to combine the two strategies. Use the passive approach to adjust your investment option based on your life stage, but time your changes using the active approach. For example, if you're in your late 40s and planning to switch from an aggressive to a balanced option, you could wait until the ASX200 crosses below the 200-day SMA before making the change. This way, you can capture the majority of the uptrend before switching to a more conservative option.\n\nIf you want more control over your superannuation assets, you could consider starting a Self-Managed Super Fund (SMSF). However, I recommend having at least $300,000 to $400,000 in assets before doing so, as the annual costs can be prohibitively high otherwise.",
    "Newsflash: investors aren't always off the hook! If they're a partner in the company, they're just as responsible for the debts as anyone else. But, if they're just a capital investor with no say in the business, then yeah, you can't sue them. But let's be real, my contract wouldn't be with them anyway!\n\nAnd, think about it, if the company you work for goes belly up, you can sue them, but what are you really going to get? Nothing, right? Unless... the registered owners of the company are held liable for its debts, which is totally possible if it's a corporation! Or, you can get them to sign on as a guarantor for your back pay. Don't even think about saying \"Nobody will ever agree to that!\" Because, if your service is valuable enough, THEY ABSOLUTELY WILL! I've done it before, and I've gotten a personal liability guarantee from a company owner. So, don't sell yourself short!",
    "You're suggesting that normal ups and downs in the market impact individual stock prices because they're often valued based on the overall market's performance. Additionally, what types of investments are considered completely safe, or 'risk-free', in this context?",
    "When markets are turbulent and investors seek safety, they often turn to US government bonds. This is true even in the face of a potential US credit rating downgrade, as there are limited alternatives for those seeking a safe haven. The reason for this lies in the fact that most AAA-rated governments have strong credit ratings due to their limited borrowing needs and relatively small economies compared to the US. As a result, their bonds are scarce and lack liquidity, making US government bonds the most attractive option for risk-averse investors.",
    "It's nonsense to think that making baby care products more expensive will significantly impact the total number of children born.

The question is, how many more will suffer before the government is forced to confront the consequences of its actions?",
    "When considering the global hotspots for Islamic finance, I had a hunch that the Middle East might not be the only player in the game. In Europe, Frankfurt and London are obvious contenders, but what about Asia? Hong Kong stands out as a prime location, given its strategic position as a hub for integrating different financial systems and its proximity to Southeast Asia. As a Special Administrative Region of China, Hong Kong offers direct access to the Chinese market without being bound by the same restrictions as Shanghai under the \"One Country, Two Systems\" framework. This unique advantage could propel Hong Kong to become a major hub for Islamic finance in the future. But will Singapore, already a significant player in the region, overshadow Hong Kong's ambitions?",
    "Can you write off business losses on your taxes? The answer is yes, but only if your business isn't considered a 'passive activity' or a 'hobby' in the eyes of the IRS. So, what's the difference? A passive activity is one that generates income without requiring your direct involvement, such as earning royalties or renting out a property. On the other hand, a hobby is an activity that doesn't turn a profit, and the IRS has a strict definition of what constitutes a hobby. If your business doesn't consistently generate a profit over time - specifically, if it doesn't show a profit in at least 3 out of the last 5 years - the IRS may view it as a hobby. And if that's the case, your loss deductions will be limited to the amount of income generated by the hobby, plus a 2% threshold of your adjusted gross income (AGI). So, it's essential to understand these distinctions to ensure you're taking advantage of the tax benefits available to you.",

    "The only plausible reason to opt for Treasury Bonds over a savings account would be if you're worried about losing control of your funds. While Treasury Bonds are generally considered a safe investment and are sometimes preferred over cash, they also have a patriotic appeal, supporting national growth. Many investors don't scrutinize the bond rates and simply invest for the sake of it, which can drive yields down. However, I would still choose a savings account over a negative interest rate any day. It appears I'm not alone in this sentiment, as various reports suggest that these bonds are a poor investment choice.",
    "Operating in multiple markets can be complex due to various factors. For instance, distribution costs in New York are extremely high. Additionally, different states have distinct generation mixes, fuel access, regulatory costs, taxes, and availability of green energy, which can impact business operations. Furthermore, some states have different restructuring models, such as Texas being fully restructured, while New York's partial restructuring has led to market issues.\n\nFor business customers, I recommend the following:\n\n1. Conduct energy audits and review processes to optimize energy usage and minimize peak demand.\n2. Avoid signing exclusivity agreements with brokers. Instead, shop around for prices and ensure transparency on the broker's commission per kWh/therm.\n3. Analyze your usage history, including demand, over the past 12 months and compare it to your utility tariff. Take steps to avoid demand charges and ensure you're not incorrectly classified.\n\nI'm happy to share more insights if you're interested.",
    "To address the question, let's first highlight the benefits of a 401k. By contributing to a 401k, you avoid paying income tax on the contributed amount and capital gains tax on the accumulated funds. However, this benefit comes with certain restrictions, such as limited withdrawals and penalties for early withdrawals before the age of 65.\n\nNow, regarding the $7,000 in question, assuming a modest 4% growth rate over 40 years, it can grow to $34,671. While this amount may be affected by inflation and other factors, it's still a significant sum. In fact, the stock market typically averages between 7-10% growth, and the bond market averages around 5%.\n\nWhile it's essential to avoid bankruptcy, if possible, it's generally best to keep the money in your 401k account. Early withdrawals can result in significant penalties and lost earning opportunities. As /u/BeatArmy99 has pointed out, the numbers show that early withdrawals can lead to substantial losses. Therefore, it's crucial to carefully consider your decision and avoid cashing out the entire amount if possible.",
    "The truth from the source itself - and no, he's not alt-right, despite being mislabeled by political interests from all sides.\n\nLet's look at some updates and flash news:\n\n1. Google preaches about diversity and women's equality, but its actions tell a different story. For instance, co-founder Sergei Brin divorced his high-achieving wife after cheating on her with a junior staffer. Guess who left the company after the scandal was exposed?\n\n2. There are rumors that Eric Schmidt, another Google executive, has a penchant for partying excessively. It's interesting that Google's leadership has chosen to remain silent on this issue.\n\nThe irony is that Google is facing a class-action lawsuit for discriminating against women (https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/aug/08/google-women-discrimination-class-action-lawsuit). It's clear that they're not practicing what they preach.\n\nWhile the alt-right may be unpleasant and often come across as ignorant, at least they don't reek of the same level of hypocrisy as their left-wing counterparts, who claim to stand for values they don't actually uphold.",

If your 401(k) comes with high costs, don't worry - just contribute enough to maximize the match and snag that free money! Having an extra $3000 in your pocket can be a lifesaver when you're starting out on a tight budget.\n\nBut if you're lucky enough to have a low-cost 401(k) with a match, it's a no-brainer - contribute as much as you can afford! And if you have a Roth 401(k) with a match, the same rules apply, with the added bonus of using Roth when you're just starting out and in a lower tax bracket. Why not have both and maximize your savings?\n\nHere's the best part: depositing into a Roth 401(k) is risk-free! You can withdraw your deposit at any time without penalty or tax. And remember, there are two separate steps to consider: depositing your earnings into a tax-sheltered account, and then choosing how to invest. Take your time, and don't worry about dividend timing - in a tax-deferred account like an IRA or 401(k), dividends aren't taxed, so it's a non-issue!",

    "Based on the discussions in the comments, I recommend a pragmatic approach as the most effective immediate course of action, while concurrently addressing the underlying long-term addiction issues. The initial step would be to obtain your husband's agreement to relinquish control of his credit cards to you for a specified period, such as three months, to assess the efficacy of this arrangement. (In my experience, individuals are more likely to consent to temporary discomfort rather than indefinite restrictions.) The second step would be to provide your husband with a means of making independent purchases, albeit with a limited budget. Some possible options could include:\n\n* A prepaid debit card with a set amount\n* A credit card with a low credit limit\n* A joint account with restricted access\n\nA combination of these options may prove to be the most effective solution. Additionally, it would be prudent to set up alerts with your bank to notify you of specific purchases (or all transactions) made by your husband. This feature is commonly offered by most banks, allowing for real-time notifications via text or email, and can be customized to trigger alerts for transactions above a certain amount or within specific categories. There is a significant psychological distinction between the prospect of being discovered at the end of the month and immediate notification, which may serve as a deterrent in itself. Furthermore, this setup may provide an opportunity to intervene and potentially reverse the purchase.\n\nIt is essential to acknowledge that these suggestions still permit some degree of enabling and temptation. If the addiction poses a significant risk to one's health (e.g., drug or alcohol addiction), I do not believe this approach would be the most suitable course of action. These recommendations are based on the assumption that the primary concern at present is financial, and I believe they can help mitigate this issue. I wish you the best of luck in addressing this challenging situation.",

In the US, for instance, the date on the check is not a binding obligation, and the check can be presented at any time. \n\nIn contrast, many other countries consider the date on the check as the start of the payment commitment, and banks will not process the payment before that date. For example, in Canada, the Canadian Payments Association's clearing rules dictate that a post-dated cheque should not be cashed before the specified date. If the cheque is cashed early, you can request that your financial institution return the funds to your account up to the day before the cheque was supposed to be cashed.",
    "I strongly advise you to exercise caution when evaluating the value of so-called \"penny auction\" websites. Take, for example, MadBid.com, a British site with UK prices that operates similarly with US prices. They claim that an iPod Touch 64GB was sold for £21.18, despite its direct price from Apple being £249. This means there were 2,118 \"bids\" placed. To calculate the total cost, you'd need to know the cost of a single \"bid\" package, but a rough estimate would be to multiply the cost of a single \"bid\" by 2,118 and add £21.18. I suspect the total would be substantially more than £249.\n\nIt's surprising that people participating in these schemes convince themselves they're the \"clever\" ones who will snag a deal. However, it's essential to recognize that a single bidder can easily place more bids than the item's value, and if you think you're more clever than everyone else, you're likely deceiving yourself.\n\nThe \"packages\" offered are likely designed to create a false sense of value. In the past, I've seen single bids cost £1, while larger packages offered bids at a discounted rate, such as 50p. The sites also encourage multiple bidders to drive up the number of bids, although there's no guarantee they won't automatically add bids to ensure a minimum price.\n\nTo clarify, these are not traditional auction sites. In a genuine auction, the highest bidder pays their bid price plus commission and receives the item, while others retain their money. In contrast, these \"auctions\" charge for every bid, and by incrementing the bid by a penny each time, they guarantee thousands of bids. Additionally, they offer products at a \"reduced\" price if you don't \"win\" the auction, which is often still higher than buying directly from the manufacturer or a reputable retailer.",

(For more information on natural gas prices, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_gas_prices.) It's essential to do your research, as fixed-price contracts can vary significantly from company to company (you can compare options at http://www.energyshop.com/).

The exorbitant home prices in San Francisco are a result of rampant speculation and poor government oversight, not a lack of tax incentives. With a population density one-tenth that of Tokyo, yet prices rivaling those of the Japanese capital, it's clear that local policymakers have failed to address the housing shortage. If a community wants to invest in more local services, that's their prerogative, but they shouldn't expect others to foot the bill.

    "Beware of the siren's song of 'high returns, low risk'! If someone promises you a deal that sounds too good to be true, it's likely because it is. Either they're clueless or cunning, and neither option is good for you. Think about it: if a genius investor stumbled upon a high-return, low-risk opportunity, they wouldn't waste their time peddling it to you. They'd repackage it as a 'stable, low-return' investment and sell it to unsuspecting buyers, raking in the profits. So, when someone dangles this carrot in front of you, remember: they're either lying through their teeth (scam alert!) or blissfully ignorant (not much better!). Don't fall for the trap – stay savvy and keep your guard up!",

    "Imagine the US government suddenly depositing a cool million bucks into Person B's account. It's as if they've conjured up a fortune out of thin air, but in reality, they haven't gained a single penny. There are two major flaws in this thinking: firstly, it wasn't the US government that did the crediting, but rather the receiving bank. And secondly, if those digital dollars are just intangible numbers without real value, then the government hasn't lost anything either.\n\nIn reality, governments play a behind-the-scenes role, overseeing the transfer process. Here's how it works: the sending bank deducts the amount from the sender's account, while the receiving bank adds it to the recipient's account. Every middleman involved in the transaction takes a cut, because the sender pays more than the recipient receives. The sending bank gets credited by a correspondent bank, while the receiving bank gets debited. If a bank sends or receives a massive amount of cash, its correspondent bank account will eventually become depleted or overflowing.\n\nTo balance the books, banks use domestic payment systems, sometimes managed by government agencies. In the US, banks have accounts with the Federal Reserve, which they use to adjust their balances. The international side of things is handled by correspondent banks, which also credit and debit their own accounts. If they end up with a currency imbalance they can't fix, they'll need to sell one currency to buy another. Luckily, global currency exchange is incredibly efficient, making it all possible.",

    "When you buy a publication, you pay for the entire thing, not just the pages you read. This is a common pricing model, and it's not unfair. Similarly, package deals like cable TV, where you get many channels you may not want, are also a standard pricing model, not a rip-off.",

    "A warrant is similar to a call option, which gives the holder the right to purchase a stock at a specified price. The key difference is that when a warrant is exercised, the issuing company issues new shares to fulfill the warrant, which dilutes the ownership stake of existing shareholders.\n\nIn this specific case, for every 9,000 shares you own, you will receive 3,000 shares and 3,000 warrants. Each warrant grants you the right to purchase an additional share at a maximum price of SEK 0.27 between April 2, 2018, and April 30, 2018. The subscription price of SEK 0.27 per unit means that you can buy one unit, consisting of one share and one warrant, for SEK 0.27. This allows you to purchase an additional share at the specified price, effectively giving you the opportunity to increase your stake in the company.",
    "To be honest, I'm a bit uneasy about letting my credit account auto-draft from my checking account, even if they're with the same institution.

That way, I have a clearer picture of my money's movement and can avoid any potential overdraft surprises. It's all about maintaining financial flexibility and peace of mind!",
    "Let's shake things up! Here's the rewritten content with a boost of energy:\n\n\"That being said, I've got to call foul on the idea that a bunch of countries still clinging to their royal and noble classes are somehow progressive. Newsflash: they're just figureheads, nothing more! And don't even get me started on the economy - it's all about the almighty dollar in a commodity-driven market. You're really going to take Norway's unique situation and assume it applies to all the Nordic countries? Not every country is swimming in oil, you know! This just goes to show how skewed your perception of these countries really is!\"",
    "I have prior experience working for one of the three major credit rating agencies. To clarify, there are various types of ratings, with the majority focused on corporate debt and public finance, specifically senior debentures and General Obligations (e.g., tax-free municipal bonds). It's essential to note that credit rating agencies are not paid by investment banks, but rather by the corporations or municipalities issuing debt. Investment banks act as syndicates, bringing transactions to market.\n\nHowever, the situation is different for mortgage-backed securities, collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), and collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), which are complex structured securitizations. In these cases, there is an overly close relationship between investment bankers and rating agencies, leading to problematic ratings.\n\nIn contrast, rating agencies have continued to perform reasonably well in their traditional business of corporate and municipal bond ratings. It's worth noting that, until around 50 years ago, S&P's fees were paid by investors purchasing bonds. After McGraw-Hill acquired S&P in 1966, the agency began charging bond issuers for ratings.\n\nNot all credit rating agencies operate on this model, though. Egan-Jones, one of the 10 Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations (NRSROs) designated by the SEC, generates revenue from investors, not bond issuers. This alternative approach offers hope for a less conflicted payment-incentive model.\n\nRegarding Nouriel Roubini's advocacy for change, it's true that government action would be required to implement his proposed reforms. However, it's uncertain whether the government would take such action. Ideally, credit rating agencies would adopt a less conflicted payment model on their own.\n\nIt's also important to recognize that the Dodd-Frank Act has removed regulatory requirements for credit ratings on bonds and securities. Currently, there is no alternative to credit rating agencies, which is a concern. The government is expected to develop an alternative, but this has yet to happen. The question remains: is it better to have no ratings at all or to have potentially inflated ratings that can create a false sense of confidence?",

    "Let's get real - businesses aren't in the charity game. They're built to turn a profit, not win popularity contests. And that means making tough decisions to stay lean and mean. I'm all about maximizing efficiency, which is why I think it's genius to have my team sleep at the office. No more wasted hours commuting, and we can get more done in less time. Unfortunately, those pesky government regulators at the Department of Labor don't see it that way, and we're stuck in a lawsuit limbo. Ugh, can't they just let us job creators do our thing?\n\nAnd speaking of efficiency, let's talk about Tim Hortons. Canadians have been losing faith in the brand long before Burger King and 3G came into the picture.

    "When it comes to tackling debt, a common dilemma arises: should you prioritize paying off high-interest loans or focus on building liquidity for the present? This age-old debate often surfaces when considering which debts to pay back first, or when weighing alternative options like investing, building an emergency fund, or saving for a big-ticket purchase.\n\nIn reality, making minimum payments and stretching out the loan term can be a strategic move, as it frees up more cash for immediate needs. However, when deciding which debts to prioritize, the math gets more nuanced. Take, for instance, the scenario where you're choosing between paying off a car loan or a mortgage. If you can't deduct the auto loan interest, it might make sense to focus on the car loan, even if the mortgage has a higher interest rate.\n\nThe key is to crunch the numbers: does the tax savings outweigh the interest savings difference? The formula to keep in mind is: tax bracket > (1 - (target loan interest rate / mortgage interest rate)). Unfortunately, many of us struggle to think long-term, whether due to natural shortsightedness or the pressing need for an emergency fund. By recognizing these biases and doing the math, you can make more informed decisions about your debt strategy.",

    "It's challenging to find a country that has existed for more than 20 minutes without some form of taxation.

    "I think the issue with my calculation is the return on equity leveraged figure (reL). Using the formula reL = rf + (ßL)(rm - rf) with a beta of -0.58 for KORS, I get -0.0048 as my reL. However, I'm questioning whether I'm using the correct beta. Should I be using a different figure? \n\nAdditionally, when calculating the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), my E/(D+E) is approximately 1.0 because KORS's market value of equity is $7 billion, while its market value of debt is only $147 million. \n\nAfter further research, I believe my initial beta of -0.58 is incorrect. Other sources suggest the beta of KORS is around -0.01 or close to 0. I found that negative betas are rare, except for gold, so I think Yahoo's figure is incorrect. Using the -0.01 beta, I get a more plausible WACC of 2.2%.",

You can easily verify this information through a simple Google search. I've provided links to several articles and studies that support this claim.\n\nRegarding the Nature article, I understand that you may have concerns about its validity.

These studies provide valuable insights into the relationship between education and income.\n\nI appreciate your point about Trump's performance in the election, and I agree that there is a correlation between income and education. However, I'd like to clarify that the relationship is more complex than a simple inverse proportionality.

    "The million-dollar question you asked in your last paragraph - what's the downside? - has a straightforward answer. When you take out a loan and close your credit cards, your credit score takes a hit. Why? Your leverage ratio skyrockets to 100% or more, and you're reducing the average age of your credit lines. On the other hand, if you take out the loan and keep your accounts open, you're adding another line of credit to the mix. This increases your total credit, lowers your leverage, but makes lenders more cautious about giving you more credit until they see how you manage your debt.\n\nHere's the silver lining: if you can snag a loan with an interest rate lower than your credit cards (no easy feat, by the way - some lenders will want APRs in the 20s or 30s!), your cost of capital will decrease. This gives you more breathing room in your budget to tackle your debt with a \"snowball\" approach. And don't forget: your minimum payment will fluctuate as your balance changes. To really make progress, consider making a consistent payment above the minimum, just like with a traditional loan. This will help you chip away at your debt and regain control of your finances.",

    "Debunking the myth: beating the market is not a pipe dream! While many people do succeed in outperforming the market, others fall short of earning the market rate of return. The secret to achieving the former lies in taking calculated risks, which, yes, also increase the likelihood of the latter. The amount of time and effort you put in can tip the scales, but generally, risk and potential reward go hand in hand. The truth is, you can't prove that something doesn't exist, just like you can't prove the non-existence of unicorns. But, let's be real, searching for a mythical creature is unlikely to yield results, especially when many others have tried before us. The evidence just isn't compelling enough.

    "All paper-based investment instruments are secure; if they were to become unreliable, it would indicate a far more profound crisis affecting our society as a whole, rendering concerns about individual retirement accounts relatively insignificant.

    "So, when you want to short a stock, you're essentially trying to sell shares that you're borrowing from your broker. To do that, you need to find buyers for those shares. Think of it like this: the ask prices are from people who want to sell shares, while the bid prices are from people who want to buy shares.\n\nLet's use your example to illustrate this. Say you want to short 1000 shares at $3.01. You'd put in a limit order to sell at that price, which would become the new ask price. But here's the thing: there's already an ask price of $3.00 for 500 shares ahead of you. So, buyers would need to snap up those 500 shares before they could even consider buying your 1000 shares at $3.01. And if they don't, your order might not get filled, even if the price drops to $1.00.\n\nIf you really want to short those 1000 shares, you could use a market order instead. Let's say there are bids for 750 shares at $2.50 and 250 shares at $2.49. Your market order would get filled at the best available prices, so you'd sell 750 shares at $2.50 and then 250 shares at $2.49.\n\nIn reality, the gap between bid and ask prices is usually much smaller. For instance, a stock might have a bid price of $10.50 and an ask price of $10.51, so it wouldn't make a huge difference whether you used a limit order or a market order.\n\nBy the way, your example wouldn't actually work in real life because most brokers don't allow shorting stocks that trade for under $5 per share.\n\nAs for your question about how often you can't make a short sale, it can happen with heavily shorted stocks if your broker can't find any more shares to borrow. And remember, you can only short stocks with a margin account, not a cash account.",
    "It is unlikely that disputing the remark will have a significant impact on your score, as it is merely a comment. The extent to which scoring models consider remarks and incorporate them into the scoring metric is unclear. However, disputing the revolving account that should be reported as closed is a distinct matter. The key question in this case is the current status of the account. Specifically, is it listed as an open collection or does it indicate that the creditor still has a pending claim? If so, disputing the account may have some effect, although the exact impact on your score cannot be predicted with certainty. If, as you suggest, the account should have been included in the bankruptcy package, correcting this error could be crucial in achieving your desired outcome. You may wish to attempt to dispute the account and observe the results. Even if the effect is minimal, it is essential to ensure that your credit report accurately reflects your financial situation.",
    "Unlock the Secret to a Tax-Free Retirement: Weigh Your IRA Options!\n\nAre you torn between a Traditional IRA and a Roth IRA? The choice is yours, but let's break down the benefits of each. With a Roth IRA, you contribute after-tax dollars, but the payoff is huge: tax-free withdrawals in retirement! On the other hand, a Traditional IRA offers tax-deductible contributions, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.\n\nSo, which one is right for you? If you can swing it, a Roth IRA is often the preferred choice. But that's not all - you may also be able to contribute to your employer's 401k plan, if offered. And, of course, you can always stash away retirement savings in a regular account. The key is to start planning now and make the most of your retirement savings options!",
    "Based on the 2017 tax rates, here's how your income will be taxed:\n\n* If you have a taxable income of $120,000, every dollar above that will be taxed at 25% until you reach $153,000.\n* After $153,000, your income will be taxed at 28%.\n* To forecast your taxes, calculate your tax liability based on your day job income, then add your 1099 income on top of that.",
    "Need to figure out a payment plan for a combined debt? If you know the total amount owed ($5,000 + $7,500 = $12,500 in this example), you can create a payment schedule using that amount and the interest rate. You can do this using a spreadsheet like Excel or Google Sheets, or online tools.\n\nNext, apply your monthly payments ($100) to the schedule. If your payment doesn't cover the monthly amount, you'll need to add the remaining interest to the balance. If you pay more than the minimum, you'll pay down the principal amount.\n\nThe remaining balance is the outstanding principal. You can use software like GnuCash or Quicken to make it easier to manage your payments and schedule. If you prefer spreadsheets, you'll need to set up 36 lines to track your payments over 3 years.\n\nWhen you're ready to pay off the debt, be sure to include any accrued interest to be fair to the lender. You can even add a full month's interest to the final payment to cover any remaining interest owed.",
    "Many employers view the excuse 'there weren't any jobs' as a euphemism for 'you weren't good enough for a job.' While it's true that there may be more workers than jobs available, employers often expect to attract top talent at a bargain price. Why settle for someone who is unemployed (and therefore perceived as less desirable) when you can poach fresh talent from a competitor, dealing a blow to their business and a boost to your own? This is the reality of today's labor market.\n\nIn American society, the prevailing 'bootstrap mentality' dictates that unemployment is the fault of the individual, not the system. Unfortunately, this recession has not done much to change this widely held misconception.",

    "Think of your money as a valuable treasure, hidden away in a chest. When you lend it to someone, you're not just giving them access to your treasure, you're also giving up the chance to use it yourself. And, of course, there's always a risk that the borrower might not be able to return your treasure, leaving you empty-handed.\n\nIt's the same with gold - if you were to lend someone your gold bars, you'd expect them to show their appreciation with some extra gold dust, right? Well, it works similarly with money. When you deposit your cash into a bank, you're essentially lending it to the bank, which then lends it to others. This way, the bank can pay you interest on your account, as a thank you for trusting them with your treasure. It's a win-win!",
    "To achieve financial stability and independence, follow these steps:\n\n1. Set up budget categories and allocate your income accordingly.\n2. Pay your bills and expenses, and make minimum payments on your debts.\n3. Identify the remaining amount as your \"extra\" money.\n4. Prioritize your financial goals in the following order:\n\t* Build an emergency fund to cover 3-6 months of living expenses.\n\t* Contribute enough to your 401k to maximize employer matching.\n\t* Use the debt snowball method to pay off your debts, starting with the smallest one first.\n\t* Once debts are cleared, reward yourself moderately and without going into debt.\n5. Shift your focus to fully funding your retirement savings, consulting a financial advisor to determine the best distribution across available accounts.\n6. Eventually, aim to contribute the maximum allowed to your tax-advantaged retirement accounts.\n7. Any remaining funds can be used for wealth building or personal goals.\n\nNote that the first two steps are one-time tasks, while the others can be worked on simultaneously. The fourth step is optional and should only be considered once the first three are complete.\n\nYou may also want to explore the concept of FIRE (Financially Independent, Retire Early), which involves saving enough to live off passive income.

While it's understandable to be frustrated, let's focus on finding a resolution that works for both parties. \n\nConsidering the circumstances, Keshlam's option 1.5 is a fair compromise. We can demand the full rent payment but be open to settling for half as a one-time courtesy. This way, both parties learn a valuable lesson and move forward. \n\nHowever, if this pattern continues or we notice a history of questionable behavior from this tenant, it may be necessary to explore legal options for eviction. It's essential to maintain a professional and respectful demeanor, even in challenging situations. \n\nLet's keep in mind that college students can be creative, and it's possible we may encounter similar issues in the future.

    "So, you're looking for travel insurance, huh? I've never seen it offered as a credit card perk, but hey, maybe it's out there somewhere. You can always buy it separately, but it's up to you to decide if it's worth the extra cash. Honestly, I think it's only worth it for super pricey trips, like a fancy cruise that costs an arm and a leg. The more you travel, the less it makes sense, since eventually the cost of one canceled trip will be less than what you've paid for insurance on all the other trips that went smoothly.\n\nAs a frequent flyer myself, I've learned to build some flexibility into my plans, especially during winter. Try not to schedule anything super important for the day of or day after your flight, if you can help it. And book those early morning flights - they're less likely to be delayed, and you'll have more options if something goes wrong. Delays due to weather or mechanical issues are pretty common, and with packed flights, it can be tough to get rebooked quickly.\n\nOh, and one more thing: be nice to the gate agents and airline staff! They're not thrilled about delays either (flight crews want to get home too!), and they can't control the weather or mechanical issues. Being rude won't get you anywhere, and it'll make them less likely to help you out. Be assertive, but throw in a smile and a kind word - it goes a long way!",

    "Debt can be categorized into two types: secured and unsecured. Secured debt is backed by an asset, such as a mortgage on a house, which can be sold to pay off the debt if needed. This type of debt is often referred to as \"good\" debt. On the other hand, unsecured debt, like credit card debt, relies solely on income to pay it back and lacks a tangible asset to fall back on. This is considered \"bad\" debt.\n\nHowever, it's essential to be cautious when considering secured debt as \"good.\" The value of the asset backing the debt can fluctuate, turning a secured debt into an unsecured one. For instance, cars depreciate quickly, making it easy to end up \"upside down\" on a car loan.\n\nThe term \"good\" debt can be misleading, as it implies that taking on debt is a good idea and downplays the associated risks. This misconception may have contributed to the high number of foreclosures, as people borrowed more than their homes were worth, effectively turning a secured debt into an unsecured one.\n\nA more prudent approach is to only borrow for essential purchases like a house, education, and possibly a car, but with caution. It's crucial to prioritize modest purchases that fit within your means to repay. For example, opt for basic transportation instead of a luxury vehicle, and keep your house payment below 25% of your take-home pay. Additionally, focus on paying off school loans as quickly as possible.\n\nUltimately, regardless of the label, it's clear that less debt is better than more debt. Even \"good\" debt can become a burden if taken on excessively.",

How will you divide capital gains and losses for tax purposes?\n\nUnless you need to combine your funds to qualify for lower-cost investment options, a joint account may not be beneficial.

    "In the literal sense, the terms 'freehold' and 'leasehold' convey their expected meanings. Freehold refers to outright ownership, whereas leasehold denotes a rental arrangement. However, it is essential to note that there are scenarios, such as the one mentioned by Peter K. in his comment, where the building and business are purchased outright, but the underlying land is leased from a separate landowner. Additionally, the business itself may be offered as either freehold or leasehold. In this context, the purchase of a pub business from a pub company may not include ownership of the physical building, which is instead leased from a property owner. The 'pub' in this instance refers to the business plan, décor, and partnerships, excluding the physical structure. It is highly recommended that you consider engaging the services of an Estate Agent to assist in your search.

    "It's misleading to suggest that Starbucks' losses in the UK are solely due to expansion costs. If that were the case, management wouldn't be patting themselves on the back for a job well done. The truth is, the UK branch is thriving and profitable, but its debt costs are artificially inflated by importing debt from abroad - debt that has zero to do with operating or expanding in the UK. This clever accounting trick allows them to slash their tax rate, but it's a luxury only giant multinationals can afford. Meanwhile, the small coffee shop down the street or local chains with just a few stores can't exploit these loopholes, leaving them to foot a much larger tax bill. It's time to ask: is it fair for our tax system to enable such practices?",
    "Embracing the Risk: A Historical Perspective on S&P Returns\n\nWhen it comes to investing in the S&P, there's no denying it comes with some level of risk. But, let's put things into perspective. Since 1871, the S&P has delivered an impressive 10.72% compound annual growth rate (CAGR). Yes, that's accompanied by a standard deviation of 18.67%, which means there have been 53 years out of 146 where returns dipped below 4%. \n\nHowever, when we zoom in on rolling 8-year periods, the CAGR drops to 9.22%, but the standard deviation shrinks to 5.74%. This means only 31 out of 139 periods saw returns below 4%. On the flip side, a staggering 26 periods boasted an 8-year return of over 15% CAGR!\n\nTo illustrate this point, I like to think of the S&P's long-term returns like a game of craps in Vegas. Sure, you might lose on a single roll, but over a series of rolls, the math is on your side. In this case, the expected return is a juicy 10%!\n\nRegarding the normality of returns, I agree they're not a perfect fit, but they're not far off either. When we look at the 139 rolling returns, we'd expect about 95 results to fall within 1 standard deviation. In reality, we get 88 returns within that range. And when we move to 2 standard deviations, we'd expect only 5% of results to lie outside that range. Surprisingly, we get only 1 result on the low side and 4 on the high side, making the actual results slightly more profitable than the normal bell curve would suggest.",
    "Can I buy VUSA on one exchange and sell it on another if my brokerage account allows trading on both exchanges? Or is it restricted to the original exchange where I purchased it? This flexibility varies depending on the broker, country, and security. I checked with Selftrade, and they don't permit trading VUSA across different exchanges. I can only buy and sell in the same currency on the same exchange.\n\nThe VUSA ETF is listed in GBP on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) and in EUR on the Amsterdam Exchange (AEX), with an Irish ISIN. While some brokers may allow inter-listed stock trading between certain exchanges, such as US and Canadian exchanges, it's not a universal rule.\n\nSince VUSA represents the same asset, its value should be consistent across exchanges once exchange rates are factored in. If there were discrepancies, arbitrage opportunities would arise, and market forces would quickly eliminate them.\n\nAssuming no currency risk, what other factors should I consider when choosing an exchange to trade on? Key considerations include:\n\n* Liquidity\n* Time differences (e.g., trading hours in Japan)\n* Tax implications across multiple continents\n* Investor protection laws in different countries\n* Finding a broker that offers access to desired markets or dealing with multiple brokers\n* Regulatory complexities",

    "During Graham's investment career, which spanned the era of the gold standard, gold and currency were equivalent. Graham's investment advice focused exclusively on bonds and stocks, with the latter limited to informed speculation. His passing occurred shortly after the gold standard was abolished in 1971. Although gold is still viewed by some investors, such as endowments, as a store of value or a means of diversifying risk, investing in currencies or commodities is not consistent with Graham's principles. A fundamental challenge in applying Graham's approach to currencies or commodities is estimating their intrinsic value reliably, which is necessary to achieve a margin of safety by comparing it to market value. Statements like 'gold is clearly underpriced in today's market' lack substance. In contrast, Graham's 'net net' approach, which values stocks based on their tangible assets minus liabilities, is a quantitative analysis of audited financial data, providing a genuine margin of safety.",
    "Get ready for a showdown! Many partnership agreements come equipped with a 'shotgun clause' - a take-it-or-leave-it proposition where one partner sets a price, and the other must either buy in or sell out. It's a bold move, to say the least. If you're confident the other partner can't run the show without you, you might make a lowball offer, knowing they'll have to swallow the deal.\n\nIn this scenario, your partner has thrown down the gauntlet, asking for a hefty $X to bow out. Failing that, they're willing to keep their half of the company and send their wife to take the reins. Now, if they can still contribute to the big picture and she can handle the daily grind, maybe it's worth keeping things as they are. But don't feel pressured to overpay just because they're making a demand.\n\nWithout a partnership agreement, things can get messy. So, here's a clever tactic: pretend there's a shotgun clause in place. Turn the tables and ask your partner if they're willing to buy you out for $X, with their wife at the helm. Chances are, they'll quickly reveal their true hand, admitting the company isn't worth that much and their wife can't run it solo. And just like that, you'll be in the midst of a real negotiation!",

You're misunderstanding the issue - I'm talking about exit taxes, not regular income or property taxes.",
    "Making a capital investment in your company does not trigger a taxable event. However, if you're the owner and choose to lend money to the business instead, it only makes sense if you want to receive interest payments from the company (for instance, if you have partners who aren't contributing financially). In this case, the interest earned would be considered taxable income to you (reported on a 1099-INT form) and the company could deduct it as an expense. On the other hand, making a capital contribution is a simpler approach, and you can later withdraw funds from the company without incurring taxes. Note that while neither scenario results in taxation, you won't be able to collect interest on your investment.",
    "The TWRR calculation can handle negative values. For instance, TWRR = (1 + 0.10) x (1 + (-0.191) ) x (1 + 0.29) ^ (1/3) = 1.047, which represents a 4.7% return. \n\nRegarding your concern about the -19% return in the second quarter, it's essential to understand that TWRR takes into account cash additions or withdrawals from the account. To illustrate, if you start with $100,000, add $10,000, and end up with $110,000, the return would be 0% since the balance increase is solely due to the deposited cash. Conversely, if you start with $100,000, add $10,000, and end up with $100,000, the return would be negative, as you've lost the deposited amount. \n\nIn the second quarter, you started with $15,000, deposited $4,000, and ended with $15,750. Essentially, you lost most of the deposited $4,000, resulting in a significant loss, which is reflected in the -19% return.",
    "Think you're taking home 75% of your salary because you're in the 25% tax bracket? Think again! There are several factors that affect your take-home pay. For starters, payroll taxes, also known as FICA, deduct 7.65% from your salary, comprising 6.2% for Social Security (capped at $118,500) and 1.45% for Medicare (capped at $200,000). Additionally, state income taxes vary by location and are also withheld from your paycheck. The 25% tax bracket is misleading, as you don't pay 25% on your entire salary. Instead, you progress through tax brackets, with parts of your income taxed at 10%, 15%, and 25%. The federal income tax withheld from your paycheck is only an estimate, and your actual tax liability may be affected by personal exemptions, deductions, credits, investment income, and penalties. When you file your tax return, you'll calculate your actual tax owed and either receive a refund or need to pay more.",

    "When determining the maximum amount of credit to grant, Bank A solely considers the credit limit at Bank B. In principle, it may be possible to persuade them to increase the limit on their card if you cancel the other card. However, given your current debt situation, a balance transfer prior to cancellation is not feasible. Therefore, Bank A must first increase the limit. To justify this increase, they will carefully evaluate your income, credit utilization history, credit score, and account tenure with them. I must emphasize that your plan for utilizing the increased debt is fraught with risk and lacks a solid foundation. Nevertheless, if you possess a sufficient income to set aside $3,000 monthly, you may be a viable candidate for a higher credit limit.",

    "Cautionary Tales of Profit Over Quality: A Lesson in Business Blunders\n\nMeet Schlitz Brewing Company, a former Fortune 500 powerhouse that sacrificed its reputation for short-term gains. In the 1970s, Schlitz's management made a series of disastrous decisions to boost profit margins, including altering their fermentation process, substituting corn syrup for malt, and using hop pellets instead of fresh hops. The result? A beer that, under certain conditions, resembled \"snot\" in consistency. The consequences were devastating: short-term profits soared, but long-term customers abandoned the brand in droves.\n\nBut Schlitz isn't the only example of a company prioritizing profits over quality. Here are three modern cautionary tales from the 2012 Fortune 500 list:\n\n* Morgan Stanley, the investment giant responsible for contributing to the global economic crash, sold financial products to customers while secretly betting against them.\n* Bank of America, which doubled interest rates on loyal customers and now charges exorbitant fees for even the most basic services, including speaking to a teller.\n* General Motors, which has compromised on quality by building cars with cheap, plastic interiors.\n\nThese examples serve as stark reminders that prioritizing profits over quality can have disastrous consequences for businesses and customers alike.

    "**Embracing Your Internship Experience**\n\nAs a past intern, I've learned a thing or two about making the most of your summer internship. Here are some tips to help you thrive:\n\n**Dress for Success (But Not Too Much)**\n\n* Leave the attaché case at home - you won't need it.\n* Unless specified, ditch the suit and tie. Observe your team's dress code and blend in.\n* Be mindful of your attire, but don't overdo it. You want to make a good impression, not stand out for the wrong reasons.\n\n**Find Your Rhythm**\n\n* Pay attention to your team's schedule and try to mirror their hours. Typically, 9-6 is a good range, but adjust according to your workload.\n* Don't be the first to leave at 5:00 pm, but also don't feel obligated to stay until 8 pm. Find a balance that works for you and your team.\n\n**Ask, Learn, and Grow**\n\n* Don't be afraid to ask questions - it's encouraged! Just be mindful of your colleagues' time and prioritize your queries.\n* Be respectful and open to feedback. It's a learning experience, after all!\n\n**Network and Socialize**\n\n* Attend events with your fellow interns and be social. It's a great way to build connections and have fun.\n* Enjoy networking events, but remember to keep things professional. You want to make a good impression, not a bad one.\n\n**Stay Focused and Relaxed**\n\n* Try not to get too stressed out. It's just an internship, and it's not life or death.\n* Unless you really mess up, you'll likely receive an offer letter at the end of the summer. So, take a deep breath and enjoy the ride!\n* And, if you can, try to stay off Reddit during work hours.\n\n**Most Importantly...**\n\n* Have fun! This is a unique opportunity to learn, grow, and make connections. Make the most of it!",

    "What's the deal with this stat? Someone claims the working age population grew by 13.4 million people between Oct 2008 and July 2014. Let me break it down. The working age population includes anyone 16 and older living in the US who's not in prison, a nursing home, or the military. And here's the thing - there's no upper age limit, so it includes people who are retired. Most people retire by 65, and only about 1 in 5 people 65 and older are still working. So, how much did the population of people aged 16-64 really grow during that time? Only by 5.8 million.",
    "I understand that you may be confusing the NYC ban with the statewide ban, which are two separate entities. It's essential to recognize the distinction between a city and a state. \n\nRegarding the effectiveness of the ban, I'd like to share an interesting article that contradicts your claim: https://www.google.com/amp/reason.com/blog/2017/01/02/despite-ban-new-york-city-had-more-airbn/amp. \n\nEven if we were to assume that NYC's fines and policing successfully deterred people from listing their properties, it's crucial to consider the bigger picture. With millions of listings across tens of thousands of cities where short-term rentals are illegal, it's clear that a single city's regulations wouldn't have a significant impact on the overall market. Your argument is not supported by evidence and is outweighed by the numerous examples that prove otherwise.",

    "Conveniently omitted is the glaring reality that this marks Argentina's eighth default, a staggering testament to the incompetence of its policymakers. Rather than refusing to pay anyone, Argentina could have negotiated a deal with NML to settle the principal and interest (or a reasonable compromise) by simply waiting until December, when a restrictive bond clause expires. This clause, which prohibits Argentina from favoring certain creditors over others, would have provided a clear opportunity for a resolution. The blame doesn't rest solely with Argentina, but it's inexcusable that this kind of financial recklessness doesn't plague other Latin American countries with such alarming regularity.",
    "Imagine a retail revolution where brick-and-mortar stores transform into vibrant showrooms, offering customers a sensory adventure that online shopping can't match. Instead of rows of inventory, stores will become interactive hubs where customers can touch, feel, and experience products before having them delivered to their doorstep the same day or next. With local warehouses handling inventory, stores can shrink in size but grow in excitement, hosting events and activities that create lifelong memories. The buzzword is 'experiential,' and it's the key to survival. Think mini rock climbing walls, virtual tennis courts, and immersive simulations that draw in customers of all ages. Without these thrilling experiences, retail will wither away, a fate that befell Sports Authority, which failed to differentiate itself from the competition. The future of retail is about creating unforgettable experiences that leave customers eager to return.",
    "I may not have personally experienced the infamous 'grad student poor' lifestyle (I juggled night classes with a full-time job), but I'd aim to stash away 10-20% of my income each month - that's $150-$300. Of course, this depends on your current savings situation. If your piggy bank is looking a little bare, consider bumping up your savings rate to 30-40%! And if you can swing it, make a beeline for a more affordable pad ASAP. Your rent is likely your biggest expense, so finding a place that costs less than $900 a month can score you instant savings without sacrificing your quality of life.",
    "In my opinion, debit cards don't necessarily hurt banks. While they don't lend money, they generate significant revenue from the commissions charged to retailers for each transaction, with minimal risk involved. However, a proposed congressional cap on these commissions could reduce debit cards to a mere service for account holders, rather than a profit source for banks.\n\nOn the other hand, I disagree that debit cards are unequivocally beneficial for individuals. They may be more convenient than checks, but they offer less protection than credit cards. I've previously argued that debit cards have limitations, and many in the community agree.\n\nThe real issue lies with the credit system, which is fundamentally flawed. It rewards those in debt by providing them with more opportunities to accumulate further debt, while those with no debt history struggle to access credit when needed. The system fails to assess the risk of individuals with no debt, making it difficult for them to secure credit. To me, the credit scoring system seems designed to generate profits, backed by governments.\n\nIt's essential to distinguish between credit cards and credit scores. If we replace 'card' with 'score' in the question, then the issue becomes clear. This is particularly relevant in the US, although I'm not familiar with how creditors assess risk in other countries.",

    "Think collecting a payment is a straightforward process? Think again! There are actually two stages involved, and two ways to reverse it. And, believe it or not, the specific combination of these stages can lead to frustratingly long refund times - on top of any human delays that might occur.\n\nWhen you whip out your credit card to make a purchase, it's not like the money instantly disappears from your account. Nope! The issuing bank simply sets the funds aside, saying, \"Hey, I've got this amount reserved for this transaction.\" You'll see this as a \"pending\" charge on your statement. It's only later, during a process called \"settlement,\" that your bank actually transfers the cash to the merchant's bank. This usually happens on the same day, but it can take a few days to wrap up. And, if you're shopping online, the merchant might not be able to start the settlement process until they've shipped your goodies.\n\nNow, what if you need to undo the transaction? Well, there are two ways to do that. You can either void the transaction, making it disappear like magic, or you can get a refund, which might show up on your statement as both the original payment and the refund. Voids can happen lightning-fast, just like authorizations, but once the settlement process starts, it's too late to void the transaction. And, guess what? Refunds go through the same settlement process, which means they can take just as long.\n\nSo, to answer your question, that SMS you received? That's just the authorization stage, where no money has actually changed hands yet. And, sorry to say, you won't see that refund money until several days after someone initiates the refund process. There's no \"reverse authorize\" button to give you or your bank a heads-up, unfortunately!",

    "It's essential to understand that eight hard inquiries over a two-year period do not significantly impact a credit score of 750. The crucial factor to consider is your credit utilization ratio. Ideally, you should be using less than 30% of your available credit limits, with less than 15% being even more desirable and 10% being optimal.\n\nIt's a common misconception that you need to wait a specific period after applying for a mortgage or credit card to increase your chances of approval for subsequent applications. However, it's vital to be mindful of the number of hard inquiries within a reporting period. In your case, eight inquiries spread over two years is a relatively modest number.\n\nTwo critical questions remain: Firstly, what is your current credit utilization ratio? And secondly, are there any negative factors in your credit history, such as delinquent payments, bankruptcies, or low credit limits? These factors, including your age and income, can significantly influence the amount institutions are willing to lend you. It's essential to recognize that some of these factors can create catch-22 situations, such as low credit limits due to a young age and limited credit history. Nevertheless, understanding these factors is crucial in determining your creditworthiness.",
    "\"The Great Food Debate: Let's Get Real About Chemicals and Choices\"\n\nWhen it comes to highly processed foods, including plant-based meat substitutes, it's easy to get caught up in the scare tactics. But let's take a step back and look at the bigger picture. The truth is, all food is made up of chemicals - yes, even water and broccoli! So, instead of demonizing certain foods, let's focus on their nutritional profiles.\n\nThe reality is, most meat alternatives fall somewhere in between being marginally better and no worse than their meat-based counterparts. Of course, getting protein from whole, nutrient-dense foods like leafy greens, whole grains, nuts, and legumes is ideal. But let's not discount the role that meat alternatives play in making plant-based diets more accessible and appealing to the masses. This shift in eating habits can have a significant positive impact on our health, and at the very least, it's not worse than an omnivorous diet.\n\nBut there's more to the story than just health benefits. Many people choose meat alternatives because of their concerns about animal welfare and the environment. Others simply enjoy the taste, which can be vastly different from traditional meat options. And let's be real, some plant-based meat alternatives are a far cry from the frozen convenience foods made from animals.\n\nSo, instead of vilifying certain foods, let's focus on promoting a balanced and informed approach to eating. By acknowledging the complexities of our food choices, we can make more thoughtful decisions that benefit not just our health, but the planet and its creatures as well.",

    "From a US perspective, it's great that many employers offer 401(k) plans, and individuals can also contribute to an IRA for tax-advantaged savings. If your company offers a 401(k) match, be sure to take full advantage of it by contributing enough to maximize the match - it's essentially free money! While pensions can be a valuable benefit, it's essential to have a diversified retirement strategy, especially considering the financial challenges some states are facing. Illinois, for example, is struggling with pension funding issues, and it's crucial to be prepared for potential changes to pension benefits. As a state employee, it's wise to supplement your pension with additional retirement savings to ensure a secure financial future. Looking ahead, it's clear that pension reform is needed to ensure sustainability. By making informed choices now, we can work towards a more stable retirement system for everyone.",
    "Consider transferring your IRA to a lower-cost provider, even if you don't plan to withdraw from it, to avoid the $100 annual fee. You have two options: move it to a fee-free provider or convert it to a Roth IRA and combine it with your existing Roth account. Either way, you'll retain the funds and save $100 per year. If you need to access your retirement savings, prioritize withdrawing from your Roth IRA, as you can take out contributions tax-free and penalty-free. However, before making a withdrawal, consider whether you should be using that money to pay off student loans instead. If you're already maxing out your Roth IRA and have sufficient retirement savings, you could redirect the $5,500 towards your loans. Ideally, if possible, use your income to pay the $7,500 and continue contributing to your retirement accounts. There's no need to tap into retirement funds to pay off loans when you can use your current income instead.",

While it is true that the standard deviations of annualized returns do decrease over time, this is misleading because the asset value itself fluctuates significantly over time. As a result, the standard deviations of the total return actually increase, indicating greater uncertainty and risk. Therefore, it is a flawed assumption to believe that having a longer time horizon allows you to take on more risk.",

    "When a check is written directly to BigCo, it becomes unclear how Jack can compensate himself for the sale of his equity stake. This is because it appears as though the equity belongs to the corporation, not Jack himself. This interpretation is accurate. In this scenario, BigCo is issuing new shares, and Jack is not receiving compensation for the equity sale because he didn't actually sell anything. Instead, the company is trading shares for capital, which it will use to fuel expansion. Over time, the capital gains generated from this expansion may exceed the value of a $200,000 interest-free loan to the company.\n\nTo illustrate this, let's consider an example. If BigCo's value before the $250,000 investment is $1 million, its value after the investment would be $1.25 million. This means that the $250,000 investment represents 20% of the company's total value. In this case, BigCo should not grant the buyer a 25% stake in the company, but rather a 20% stake. If BigCo were to give the buyer a 25% stake, the buyer would be receiving a $312,500 stake in the company for only $250,000, which would be an unfair deal.\n\nIn contrast, if Jack sells 25% of the company from his personal shares, this transaction does not affect the company's overall valuation. Jack's stake in the company is simply reduced, while the company's value remains the same. If Jack then loans the company $200,000, this transaction also does not impact the company's valuation, as the $200,000 asset is offset by the $200,000 liability. The company's assets and liabilities remain balanced.\n\nIf you know that the company's valuation is $1 million and the buyer is paying $250,000 for a 25% stake at that valuation, then it is clear that the check is being written to Jack personally. However, if the check is written to BigCo, then one or more of these numbers must be incorrect. The buyer may be receiving a 20% stake, the company's new valuation may be $1.25 million, or the buyer may be paying $333,333.33 for the stake. Alternatively, BigCo's pre-investment valuation may be $750,000, or Jack may be selling $312,500 worth of stock for only $250,000, resulting in a loss of value for his shares. There are various possible scenarios that could balance out the numbers.",

    "Crack the Code: What Fixed Rates Reveal About the Future of Interest Rates\n\nWhen fixed rates dip below variable rates, it's often a telltale sign that banks are betting on a rate drop in the near future. But that's not the only clue to decipher. Take a closer look at fixed rates across different terms - 1 year, 3 year, and 5 year - to uncover the banks' true expectations.\n\nIf 3 and 5 year fixed rates are higher than their 1 year counterparts, it may indicate that banks think rates will plummet in the short term, but only temporarily. They're anticipating a rebound in the not-too-distant future. On the other hand, if 3 year fixed rates are also surprisingly low, it could be a sign that banks are bracing for a prolonged economic downturn.\n\nBanks are always trying to stay one step ahead, adjusting their fixed rates based on their forecast of the economy's trajectory. Since May 2011, we've seen the standard variable rate drop not once, but twice - in November and December - to a current rate of 7.30%. And what's more, fixed rates have also taken a tumble, hinting at even more variable rate cuts on the horizon.\n\nStay ahead of the curve and keep a close eye on those fixed rates - they might just hold the secret to predicting the next move in interest rates.\n\nBest, Victor",

    "**Understanding Your Loan**\n\nWhen you take out a loan, the initial amount you borrow is called the principal. However, you also need to consider the interest that builds up over time. In this case, the interest that accrues before you start making payments is added to the principal, making the total amount you need to pay back even higher.\n\nLet's break it down: if you borrowed $5,500 and interest of $436 accrued, your new principal balance would be $5,936. To pay off this amount over 10 years at an interest rate of 6.8%, your monthly payment would be $68.31. Over the course of 10 years, you'll make 120 payments, totaling $8,197.40.",

    "A 20% deduction is likely an overkill. A more realistic benchmark is 2%, but this can fluctuate wildly depending on the industry landscape. To get a more accurate picture, I recommend calculating the average working capital over the past 2-3 years and subtracting that from the cash reserves. Working capital is the difference between current assets - including cash, prepaid expenses, and accounts receivable - and current liabilities. This means current assets will often far surpass cash alone, leaving a larger surplus after liabilities are accounted for. This, in turn, shrinks the enterprise value, making the EV/EBITDA ratio appear even more expensive, as Dimitri pointed out. However, it's essential to remember that a balance sheet is just a snapshot in time, susceptible to seasonal fluctuations. To smooth out these distortions, average the results over several periods. After crunching the numbers for a few companies, compare the outcome to revenue. Does it hover around the 2% mark?",

    "Break Free from the Cycle of Economic Hardship: It's Time for a Change\n\nAre you tired of living paycheck to paycheck, working multiple jobs just to make ends meet? The harsh reality is that economic hardship can be just as suffocating as economic slavery. But it's time to shatter the myth that hard work alone is enough to guarantee a better life.\n\nWhile exceptional individuals may be able to climb out of the hole, what about those who are working tirelessly, pouring their hearts and souls into two full-time jobs, yet still struggling to afford the basics? It's time to recognize that their efforts deserve more than just a pat on the back.\n\nI'm not advocating for a blanket $15 minimum wage, but I firmly believe that legislation should prioritize the well-being of those who are putting in the long hours. Imagine a world where working 60-85 hours a week guarantees a decent standard of living: a modest roof over your head, nutritious food on the table, access to quality healthcare, and a chance to save for the future.\n\nLet's be realistic – minimum wage jobs are often filled by young people starting out or older individuals with limited skills. Rather than imposing a one-size-fits-all solution, we should focus on targeted legislation that supports those who need it most. High school and college students won't be working 60-85 hours a week, so let's reserve subsidies for those who are truly struggling to make ends meet.\n\nIt's time to break free from the cycle of economic hardship and create a system that rewards hard work with a dignified life.

    "Unlock the Secret to Investing in Uber: A Dynamic Approach!\n\nEver wondered how to tap into the lucrative world of Uber investing? As a privately-held company, direct stock purchases are off-limits to the average investor. But fear not! We've got the inside scoop on indirect methods to invest in Uber and even short it.\n\nOne clever strategy is to invest in (or short) companies that have a stake in Uber's success. Think Alphabet/Google (GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Toyota (ADR), and other power players. If Uber takes a hit, these companies will feel the ripple effect, making them a viable target for shorting.\n\nAnother approach is to identify Uber's competitors and potential beneficiaries of its downfall. Lyft might seem like an obvious choice, but its similarities to Uber make it a risky bet. Instead, consider traditional taxi companies or service providers like Medallion Financial Corporation (MFIN). These investments offer exposure to Uber's performance, but be aware that they're influenced by a multitude of factors beyond Uber's control.\n\nFor a deeper dive, check out Investopedia's insightful article, \"Ways to Invest in Uber before It Goes Public.\" And a word of caution: while these strategies can be intriguing, they're not without risk. Proceed with caution and do your due diligence before making any investment decisions."
