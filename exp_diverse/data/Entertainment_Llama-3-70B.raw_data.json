    "I rented I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW from my video store because of all the controversy that surrounded it when it was first released in 1967. I also heard that at first it was seized by U.S. customs if it ever tried to enter this country, therefore being a fan of films considered \"controversial\" I really had to see this for myself.<br /><br />The plot is centered around a young Swedish drama student named Lena who wants to learn everything she can about life. In particular she wants to focus her attentions to making some sort of documentary on what the average Swede thought about certain political issues such as the Vietnam War and race issues in the United States. In between asking politicians and ordinary denizens of Stockholm about their opinions on politics, she has sex with her drama teacher, classmates, and married men.<br /><br />What kills me about I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is that 40 years ago, this was considered pornographic. Really, the sex and nudity scenes are few and far between, even then it's not shot like some cheaply made porno. While my countrymen mind find it shocking, in reality sex and nudity are a major staple in Swedish cinema. Even Ingmar Bergman, arguably their answer to good old boy John Ford, had sex scenes in his films.<br /><br />I do commend the filmmakers for the fact that any sex shown in the film is shown for artistic purposes rather than just to shock people and make money to be shown in pornographic theaters in America. I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is a good film for anyone wanting to study the meat and potatoes (no pun intended) of Swedish cinema. But really, this film doesn't have much of a plot.",
    "\"I Am Curious: Yellow\" is a risible and pretentious steaming pile. It doesn't matter what one's political views are because this film can hardly be taken seriously on any level. As for the claim that frontal male nudity is an automatic NC-17, that isn't true. I've seen R-rated films with male nudity. Granted, they only offer some fleeting views, but where are the R-rated films with gaping vulvas and flapping labia? Nowhere, because they don't exist. The same goes for those crappy cable shows: schlongs swinging in the breeze but not a clitoris in sight. And those pretentious indie movies like The Brown Bunny, in which we're treated to the site of Vincent Gallo's throbbing johnson, but not a trace of pink visible on Chloe Sevigny. Before crying (or implying) \"double-standard\" in matters of nudity, the mentally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women: there are no genitals on display when actresses appears nude, and the same cannot be said for a man. In fact, you generally won't see female genitals in an American film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica. This alleged double-standard is less a double standard than an admittedly depressing ability to come to terms culturally with the insides of women's bodies.",
    "If only to avoid making this type of film in the future. This film is interesting as an experiment but tells no cogent story.<br /><br />One might feel virtuous for sitting thru it because it touches on so many IMPORTANT issues but it does so without any discernable motive. The viewer comes away with no new perspectives (unless one comes up with one while one's mind wanders, as it will invariably do during this pointless film).<br /><br />One might better spend one's time staring out a window at a tree growing.<br /><br />",
    "This film was probably inspired by Godard's Masculin, féminin and I urge you to see that film instead.<br /><br />The film has two strong elements and those are, (1) the realistic acting (2) the impressive, undeservedly good, photo. Apart from that, what strikes me most is the endless stream of silliness. Lena Nyman has to be most annoying actress in the world. She acts so stupid and with all the nudity in this film,...it's unattractive. Comparing to Godard's film, intellectuality has been replaced with stupidity. Without going too far on this subject, I would say that follows from the difference in ideals between the French and the Swedish society.<br /><br />A movie of its time, and place. 2/10.",
    "Oh, brother...after hearing about this ridiculous film for umpteen years all I can think of is that old Peggy Lee song..<br /><br />\"Is that all there is??\" ...I was just an early teen when this smoked fish hit the U.S. I was too young to get in the theater (although I did manage to sneak into \"Goodbye Columbus\"). Then a screening at a local film museum beckoned - Finally I could see this film, except now I was as old as my parents were when they schlepped to see it!!<br /><br />The ONLY reason this film was not condemned to the anonymous sands of time was because of the obscenity case sparked by its U.S. release. MILLIONS of people flocked to this stinker, thinking they were going to see a sex film...Instead, they got lots of closeups of gnarly, repulsive Swedes, on-street interviews in bland shopping malls, asinie political pretension...and feeble who-cares simulated sex scenes with saggy, pale actors.<br /><br />Cultural icon, holy grail, historic artifact..whatever this thing was, shred it, burn it, then stuff the ashes in a lead box!<br /><br />Elite esthetes still scrape to find value in its boring pseudo revolutionary political spewings..But if it weren't for the censorship scandal, it would have been ignored, then forgotten.<br /><br />Instead, the \"I Am Blank, Blank\" rhythymed title was repeated endlessly for years as a titilation for porno films (I am Curious, Lavender - for gay films, I Am Curious, Black - for blaxploitation films, etc..) and every ten years or so the thing rises from the dead, to be viewed by a new generation of suckers who want to see that \"naughty sex film\" that \"revolutionized the film industry\"...<br /><br />Yeesh, avoid like the plague..Or if you MUST see it - rent the video and fast forward to the \"dirty\" parts, just to get it over with.<br /><br />",
    "I would put this at the top of my list of films in the category of unwatchable trash! There are films that are bad, but the worst kind are the ones that are unwatchable but you are suppose to like them because they are supposed to be good for you! The sex sequences, so shocking in its day, couldn't even arouse a rabbit. The so called controversial politics is strictly high school sophomore amateur night Marxism. The film is self-consciously arty in the worst sense of the term. The photography is in a harsh grainy black and white. Some scenes are out of focus or taken from the wrong angle. Even the sound is bad! And some people call this art?<br /><br />",
    "Whoever wrote the screenplay for this movie obviously never consulted any books about Lucille Ball, especially her autobiography. I've never seen so many mistakes in a biopic, ranging from her early years in Celoron and Jamestown to her later years with Desi. I could write a whole list of factual errors, but it would go on for pages. In all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film. The filmmakers tried hard, but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me.",
    "When I first saw a glimpse of this movie, I quickly noticed the actress who was playing the role of Lucille Ball. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucy is absolutely awful. Lucille Ball was an astounding comedian with incredible talent. To think about a legend like Lucille Ball being portrayed the way she was in the movie is horrendous. I cannot believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a much better Lucy, the producers decided to get Rachel York. She might be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of Lucille Ball is tough. It is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble Lucille Ball, but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent. If you noticed York's portrayal of Lucy in episodes of I Love Lucy like the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin, nothing is similar in any way-her expression, voice, or movement.<br /><br />To top it all off, Danny Pino playing Desi Arnaz is horrible. Pino does not qualify to play as Ricky. He's small and skinny, his accent is unreal, and once again, his acting is unbelievable. Although Fred and Ethel were not similar either, they were not as bad as the characters of Lucy and Ricky.<br /><br />Overall, extremely horrible casting and the story is badly told. If people want to understand the real life situation of Lucille Ball, I suggest watching A&E Biography of Lucy and Desi, read the book from Lucille Ball herself, or PBS' American Masters: Finding Lucy. If you want to see a docudrama, \"Before the Laughter\" would be a better choice. The casting of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in \"Before the Laughter\" is much better compared to this. At least, a similar aspect is shown rather than nothing.",
    "Who are these \"They\"- the actors? the filmmakers? Certainly couldn't be the audience- this is among the most air-puffed productions in existence. It's the kind of movie that looks like it was a lot of fun to shoot TOO much fun, nobody is getting any actual work done, and that almost always makes for a movie that's no fun to watch.<br /><br />Ritter dons glasses so as to hammer home his character's status as a sort of doppleganger of the bespectacled Bogdanovich; the scenes with the breezy Ms. Stratten are sweet, but have an embarrassing, look-guys-I'm-dating-the-prom-queen feel to them. Ben Gazzara sports his usual cat's-got-canary grin in a futile attempt to elevate the meager plot, which requires him to pursue Audrey Hepburn with all the interest of a narcoleptic at an insomnia clinic. In the meantime, the budding couple's respective children (nepotism alert: Bogdanovich's daughters) spew cute and pick up some fairly disturbing pointers on 'love' while observing their parents. (Ms. Hepburn, drawing on her dignity, manages to rise above the proceedings- but she has the monumental challenge of playing herself, ostensibly.) Everybody looks great, but so what? It's a movie and we can expect that much, if that's what you're looking for you'd be better off picking up a copy of Vogue.<br /><br />Oh- and it has to be mentioned that Colleen Camp thoroughly annoys, even apart from her singing, which, while competent, is wholly unconvincing... the country and western numbers are woefully mismatched with the standards on the soundtrack. Surely this is NOT what Gershwin (who wrote the song from which the movie's title is derived) had in mind; his stage musicals of the 20's may have been slight, but at least they were long on charm. \"They All Laughed\" tries to coast on its good intentions, but nobody- least of all Peter Bogdanovich - has the good sense to put on the brakes.<br /><br />Due in no small part to the tragic death of Dorothy Stratten, this movie has a special place in the heart of Mr. Bogdanovich- he even bought it back from its producers, then distributed it on his own and went bankrupt when it didn't prove popular. His rise and fall is among the more sympathetic and tragic of Hollywood stories, so there's no joy in criticizing the film... there _is_ real emotional investment in Ms. Stratten's scenes. But \"Laughed\" is a faint echo of \"The Last Picture Show\", \"Paper Moon\" or \"What's Up, Doc\"- following \"Daisy Miller\" and \"At Long Last Love\", it was a thundering confirmation of the phase from which P.B. has never emerged.<br /><br />All in all, though, the movie is harmless, only a waste of rental. I want to watch people having a good time, I'll go to the park on a sunny day. For filmic expressions of joy and love, I'll stick to Ernest Lubitsch and Jaques Demy...",
    "This is said to be a personal film for Peter Bogdonavitch. He based it on his life but changed things around to fit the characters, who are detectives. These detectives date beautiful models and have no problem getting them. Sounds more like a millionaire playboy filmmaker than a detective, doesn't it? This entire movie was written by Peter, and it shows how out of touch with real people he was. You're supposed to write what you know, and he did that, indeed. And leaves the audience bored and confused, and jealous, for that matter. This is a curio for people who want to see Dorothy Stratten, who was murdered right after filming. But Patti Hanson, who would, in real life, marry Keith Richards, was also a model, like Stratten, but is a lot better and has a more ample part. In fact, Stratten's part seemed forced; added. She doesn't have a lot to do with the story, which is pretty convoluted to begin with. All in all, every character in this film is somebody that very few people can relate with, unless you're millionaire from Manhattan with beautiful supermodels at your beckon call. For the rest of us, it's an irritating snore fest. That's what happens when you're out of touch. You entertain your few friends with inside jokes, and bore all the rest.",
    "It was great to see some of my favorite stars of 30 years ago including John Ritter, Ben Gazarra and Audrey Hepburn. They looked quite wonderful. But that was it. They were not given any characters or good lines to work with. I neither understood or cared what the characters were doing.<br /><br />Some of the smaller female roles were fine, Patty Henson and Colleen Camp were quite competent and confident in their small sidekick parts. They showed some talent and it is sad they didn't go on to star in more and better films. Sadly, I didn't think Dorothy Stratten got a chance to act in this her only important film role.<br /><br />The film appears to have some fans, and I was very open-minded when I started watching it. I am a big Peter Bogdanovich fan and I enjoyed his last movie, \"Cat's Meow\" and all his early ones from \"Targets\" to \"Nickleodeon\". So, it really surprised me that I was barely able to keep awake watching this one.<br /><br />It is ironic that this movie is about a detective agency where the detectives and clients get romantically involved with each other. Five years later, Bogdanovich's ex-girlfriend, Cybil Shepherd had a hit television series called \"Moonlighting\" stealing the story idea from Bogdanovich. Of course, there was a great difference in that the series relied on tons of witty dialogue, while this tries to make do with slapstick and a few screwball lines.<br /><br />Bottom line: It ain't no \"Paper Moon\" and only a very pale version of \"What's Up, Doc\".",
    "I can't believe that those praising this movie herein aren't thinking of some other film. I was prepared for the possibility that this would be awful, but the script (or lack thereof) makes for a film that's also pointless. On the plus side, the general level of craft on the part of the actors and technical crew is quite competent, but when you've got a sow's ear to work with you can't make a silk purse. Ben G fans should stick with just about any other movie he's been in. Dorothy S fans should stick to Galaxina. Peter B fans should stick to Last Picture Show and Target. Fans of cheap laughs at the expense of those who seem to be asking for it should stick to Peter B's amazingly awful book, Killing of the Unicorn.",
    "Never cast models and Playboy bunnies in your films! Bob Fosse's \"Star 80\" about Dorothy Stratten, of whom Bogdanovich was obsessed enough to have married her SISTER after her murder at the hands of her low-life husband, is a zillion times more interesting than Dorothy herself on the silver screen. Patty Hansen is no actress either..I expected to see some sort of lost masterpiece a la Orson Welles but instead got Audrey Hepburn cavorting in jeans and a god-awful \"poodlesque\" hair-do....Very disappointing....\"Paper Moon\" and \"The Last Picture Show\" I could watch again and again. This clunker I could barely sit through once. This movie was reputedly not released because of the brouhaha surrounding Ms. Stratten's tawdry death; I think the real reason was because it was so bad!",
    "Its not the cast. A finer group of actors, you could not find. Its not the setting. The director is in love with New York City, and by the end of the film, so are we all! Woody Allen could not improve upon what Bogdonovich has done here. If you are going to fall in love, or find love, Manhattan is the place to go. No, the problem with the movie is the script. There is none. The actors fall in love at first sight, words are unnecessary. In the director's own experience in Hollywood that is what happens when they go to work on the set. It is reality to him, and his peers, but it is a fantasy to most of us in the real world. So, in the end, the movie is hollow, and shallow, and message-less.",
    "Today I found \"They All Laughed\" on VHS on sale in a rental. It was a really old and very used VHS, I had no information about this movie, but I liked the references listed on its cover: the names of Peter Bogdanovich, Audrey Hepburn, John Ritter and specially Dorothy Stratten attracted me, the price was very low and I decided to risk and buy it. I searched IMDb, and the User Rating of 6.0 was an excellent reference. I looked in \"Mick Martin & Marsha Porter Video & DVD Guide 2003\" and  wow  four stars! So, I decided that I could not waste more time and immediately see it. Indeed, I have just finished watching \"They All Laughed\" and I found it a very boring overrated movie. The characters are badly developed, and I spent lots of minutes to understand their roles in the story. The plot is supposed to be funny (private eyes who fall in love for the women they are chasing), but I have not laughed along the whole story. The coincidences, in a huge city like New York, are ridiculous. Ben Gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man, with the women falling for him as if her were a Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas or George Clooney, is quite ridiculous. In the end, the greater attractions certainly are the presence of the Playboy centerfold and playmate of the year Dorothy Stratten, murdered by her husband pretty after the release of this movie, and whose life was showed in \"Star 80\" and \"Death of a Centerfold: The Dorothy Stratten Story\"; the amazing beauty of the sexy Patti Hansen, the future Mrs. Keith Richards; the always wonderful, even being fifty-two years old, Audrey Hepburn; and the song \"Amigo\", from Roberto Carlos. Although I do not like him, Roberto Carlos has been the most popular Brazilian singer since the end of the 60's and is called by his fans as \"The King\". I will keep this movie in my collection only because of these attractions (manly Dorothy Stratten). My vote is four.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): \"Muito Riso e Muita Alegria\" (\"Many Laughs and Lots of Happiness\")",
    "This film is just plain horrible. John Ritter doing pratt falls, 75% of the actors delivering their lines as if they were reading them from cue cards, poor editing, horrible sound mixing (dialogue is tough to pick up in places over the background noise), and a plot that really goes nowhere. I didn't think I'd ever say this, but Dorothy Stratten is not the worst actress in this film. There are at least 3 others that suck more. Patti Hansen delivers her lines with the passion of Ben Stein. I started to wonder if she wasn't dead inside. Even Bogdanovich's kids are awful (the oldest one is definitely reading her lines from a cue card). This movie is seriously horrible. There's a reason Bogdanovich couldn't get another project until 4 years later. Please don't watch it. If you see it in your television listings, cancel your cable. If a friend suggests it to you, reconsider your friendship. If your spouse wants to watch it, you're better off finding another soulmate. I'd rather gouge my eyes out with lawn darts than sit through this piece of garbage again. If I could sum this film up in one word, that word would be: Suckotrocity",
    "My interest in Dorothy Stratten caused me to purchase this video. Although it had great actors/actresses, there were just too many subplots going on to retain interest. Plus it just wasn't that interesting. Dialogue was stiff and confusing and the story just flipped around too much to be believable. I was pretty disappointed in what I believe was one of Audrey Hepburn's last movies. I'll always love John Ritter best in slapstick. He was just too pathetic here.",
    "I think I will make a movie next weekend. Oh wait, I'm working..oh I'm sure I can fit it in. It looks like whoever made this film fit it in. I hope the makers of this crap have day jobs because this film sucked!!! It looks like someones home movie and I don't think more than $100 was spent making it!!! Total crap!!! Who let's this stuff be released?!?!?!",
    "Pros: Nothing<br /><br />Cons: Everything<br /><br />Plot summary: A female reporter runs into a hitchhiker that tells her stories about the deaths of people that were killed by zombies.<br /><br />Review: Never in my life have I come across a movie as bad The Zombie Chronicles. Filmed on a budget of what looks to be about 20 bucks, TZC is a completely horrible horror movie that relies on lame, forgetable actors whom couldn't act to save their lives and gore that's more gross than frightening. How does a movie like this even get made? Simply put, avoid TZC like a sexually-transmitted disease.<br /><br />My last 2 cents: Humorously enough, this movie was made by a movie company called Brain Damage Films. They're brains must have really been damaged to come up with a craptacular movie like this.<br /><br />My rating: 1 out of 10(If it were up to me, this movie would get the rating of negative bajillion)",
    "If the crew behind \"Zombie Chronicles\" ever read this, here's some advice guys: <br /><br />1. In a \"Twist Ending\"-type movie, it's not a good idea to insert close-ups of EVERY DEATH IN THE MOVIE in the opening credits. That tends to spoil the twists, y'know...? <br /><br />2. I know you produced this on a shoestring and - to be fair - you worked miracles with your budget but please, hire people who can actually act. Or at least, walk, talk and gesture at the same time. Joe Haggerty, I'm looking at you...<br /><br />3. If you're going to set a part of your movie in the past, only do this if you have the props and costumes of the time.<br /><br />4. Twist endings are supposed to be a surprise. Sure, we don't want twists that make no sense, but signposting the \"reveal\" as soon as you introduce a character? That's not a great idea.<br /><br />Kudos to the guys for trying, but in all honesty, I'd rather they hadn't...<br /><br />Only for zombie completists.",
    "1st watched 8/3/2003 - 2 out of 10(Dir-Brad Sykes): Mindless 3-D movie about flesh-eating zombies in a 3 story within a movie chronicle. And yes, we get to see zombies eating human flesh parts in 3D!! Wow, not!! That has been done time and time again in 2D in a zombie movie but what usually makes a zombie movie better is the underlying story not the actual flesh-eating. That's what made the original zombie classics good. The flesh-eating was just thrown in as an extra. We're actually bored throughout most of this 3-part chronicle because of the lame(twilight-zone like) easily understood and slow-pacingly revealed finale's. The last story is actually the story the movie started with(having a reporter investigating a so-called ghost town) and of course we get to see flesh eating zombie's in that one as well. Well, I think I've said enough. Watch the classics, not this 3D bore-feast.",
    "There's tons of good-looking women in this flick. But alas, this movie is nudity-free. Grrrrrrrrrr Strike one.<br /><br />Ahem. One story in this film takes place in 1971. Then why the hell are the main characters driving a Kia Sportage? Hello? Continuity, anyone?<br /><br />As you might know, this movie was released in stereoscopic 3D. And it is the most hideous effect I have ever seen. I'm not sure if someone botched the job on this, but there WAS no 3D, just double-vision blurs. I didn't have the same problem with this company's other 3D movies, HUNTING SEASON and CAMP BLOOD. Sure, the 3D in those ones sucked too, but with them I could see a semblance of 3D effect.<br /><br />This thing is a big ball of nothing.<br /><br />And whoever that women was who played the daughter of the ear-eating dame, yum! I'd like to see more of her. In movies, as well. Looks like Janet Margolin at a young age. Purrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr<br /><br />",
    "En route to a small town that lays way off the beaten track (but which looks suspiciously close to a freeway), a female reporter runs into a strange hitch-hiker who agrees to help direct her to her destination. The strange man then recounts a pair of gruesome tales connected to the area: in the first story, an adulterous couple plot to kill the woman's husband, but eventually suffer a far worse fate themselves when they are attacked by a zombie; and in the second story, a group of campers have their vacation cut short when an undead outlaw takes umbrage at having his grave peed on.<br /><br />The Zombie Chronicles is an attempt by writer Garrett Clancy and director Brad Sykes at making a zombie themed anthologya nice idea, but with only two stories, it falls woefully short. And that's not the only way in which this low budget gore flick fails to deliver: the acting is lousy (with Joe Haggerty, as the tale-telling Ebenezer Jackson, giving one of the strangest performances I have ever seen); the locations are uninspired; the script is dreary; there's a sex scene with zero nudity; and the ending.... well, that beggars belief.<br /><br />To be fair, some of Sykes' creative camera-work is effective (although the gimmicky technique employed as characters run through the woods is a tad overused) and Joe Castro's cheapo gore is enthusiastic: an ear is bitten off, eyeballs are plucked out, a face is removed, brains are squished, and there is a messy decapitation. These positives just about make the film bearable, but be warned, The Zombie Chronicles ain't a stroll in the park, even for seasoned viewers of z-grade trash.<br /><br />I give The Zombie Chronicles 2/10, but generously raise my rating to 3 since I didn't get to view the film with the benefit of 3D (although I have a sneaking suspicion that an extra dimension wouldn't have made that much of a difference).",
    "Without wishing to be a killjoy, Brad Sykes is responsible for at least two of the most dull and clichéd films i've ever seen - this being one of them, and Camp Blood being another. <br /><br />The acting is terrible, the print is shoddy, and everything about this film screams \"seriously, you could do better yourself\". Maybe this is a challenge to everyone to saturate youtube with our own zombie related crap?<br /><br />I bought this for £1, but remember, you can't put a price on 71 minutes of your life. You'd do well to avoid this turkey, even at a bargain basement price.",
    "My girlfriend once brought around The Zombie Chronicles for us to watch as a joke. Little did we realize the joke was on her for paying £1 for it. While watching this film I started to come up with things I would rather be doing than watching The Zombie Chronicles. These included:<br /><br />1) Drinking bleach 2) Rubbing sand in my eyes 3) Writing a letter to Brad Sykes and Garrett Clancy 4) Re-enacting the American civil war 5) Tax returns 6) GCSE Maths 7) Sex with an old lady.<br /><br />Garrett Clancy, aka Sgt. Ben Draper wrote this? The guy couldn't even dig a hole properly. The best ting he did was kick a door down (the best part of the film). This was the worst film I have ever seen, and I've seen White Noise: The Light. Never has a film had so many mistakes in it. My girlfriend left it here, so now I live with the shame of owning this piece of crap.<br /><br />News just in: Owen Wilson watched this film and tried to kill himself. Fact.<br /><br />DO NOT WATCH",
    "Amateur, no budget films can be surprisingly good ... this however is not one of them.<br /><br />Ah, another Brad Sykes atrocity. The acting is hideous, except for Emmy Smith who shows some promise. The camera \"direction\" needs serious reworking. And no more \"hold the camera and run\" gimmicks either; it just doesn't work. The special effects are unimaginative, there's a problem when the effect can be identified in real time. If you're going to rip off an ear, please don't let us see the actor's real ear beneath the blood. The scenery is bland and boring (same as Mr. Sykes other ventures), and the music is a cross between cheap motel porn and really bad guitar driven metal (see the scenery comment).<br /><br />Did I mention the lack of any real plot, or character development? Apparently, the scriptwriter didn't.<br /><br />Whoever is funding this guy ... please stop. I've seen some of his other \"home movies\" (which I will not plug) and they are just as bad. Normally, a \"director\" will grow and learn from his previous efforts ... not this guy. It's one thing to be an amateur filmmaker, but anyone can be a hack.<br /><br />Definitely not even a popcorn film ... of course, chewing on popcorn kernels would be less painful than this effort.<br /><br />Award: The worst ever military push-ups in a film.",

    "Some films that you pick up for a pound turn out to be rather good - 23rd Century films released dozens of obscure Italian and American movie that were great, but although Hardgore released some Fulci films amongst others, the bulk of their output is crap like The Zombie Chronicles.<br /><br />The only positive thing I can say about this film is that it's nowhere near as annoying as the Stink of Flesh. Other than that, its a very clumsy anthology film with the technical competence of a Lego house built by a whelk.<br /><br />It's been noted elsewhere, but you really do have to worry about a film that inserts previews of the action into its credit sequence, so by the time it gets to the zombie attacks, you've seen it all already.<br /><br />Bad movie fans will have a ball watching the 18,000 continuity mistakes and the diabolical acting of the cast (especially the hitchhiker, who was so bad he did make me laugh a bit), and kudos to Hardgore for getting in to the spirit of things by releasing a print so bad it felt like I was watching some beat up home video of a camping trip.<br /><br />Awful, awful stuff. We've all made stuff like this when we've gotten a hold of a camera, but common sense prevails and these films languish in our cupboards somewhere. Avoid.",

    "I have not seen many low budget films i must admit, but this is the worst movie ever probably, the main character the old man talked like, he had a lobotomy and lost the power to speak more than one word every 5 seconds, a 5 year old could act better. The story had the most awful plot, and well the army guy had put what he thought was army like and then just went over the top, i only watched it to laugh at how bad it was, and hoped it was leading onto the real movie. I cant believe it was under the 2 night rental thing at blockbusters, instead of a please take this for free and get it out of our sight. I think there was one semi decent actor other than the woman, i think the only thing OK with the budget was the make up, but they show every important scene of the film in the beginning music bit. Awful simply awful.",
    "..Oh wait, I can! This movie is not for the typical film snob, unless you want to brush up on your typical cinematic definitions, like \"continuity editing\" and \"geographic match\". I couldn't tell where I was in this movie. One second they're in the present, next minute their supposedly in the 70's driving a modern SUV and wearing what looked like to me as 80's style clothing. I think. I couldn't pay long enough attention to it since the acting was just horrible. I think it only got attention because it has a 3d which I did not watch. If you're a b-movie buff, and by b-movie I mean BAD movie, then this film is for you. It's home-movie and all non-sense style will keep you laughing for as long as you can stay awake. If your tastes are more for Goddard and Antonioni, though, just skip this one.",
    "You have to admire Brad Sykes even if you don't particularly want to, a man who churns out budget horror after budget horror to less than enthusiastic receptions. But keeps on doing it all the same. Even the half-hearted praise than surrounds his Camp Blood films is given grudgingly and I'm as guilty of this as anyone. Brad normally manages to throw something interesting into the mix, a neat idea, a kooky character, whatever, but without the funds to take it further than base level, he relies on the audience to cut him some slack and appreciate it for what it is and what it could be. Joe Haggerty gives a spirited and very funny performance as Ebenezer Jackson and its a credit to Sykes that he can sense that this oddball turn is going to work within the framework of the film. Coming to a multiplex near you, in a parallel universe, somewhere.",
    "THE ZOMBIE CHRONICLES <br /><br />Aspect ratio: 1.33:1 (Nu-View 3-D)<br /><br />Sound format: Mono<br /><br />Whilst searching for a (literal) ghost town in the middle of nowhere, a young reporter (Emmy Smith) picks up a grizzled hitchhiker (Joseph Haggerty) who tells her two stories involving flesh-eating zombies reputed to haunt the area.<br /><br />An ABSOLUTE waste of time, hobbled from the outset by Haggerty's painfully amateurish performance in a key role. Worse still, the two stories which make up the bulk of the running time are utterly routine, made worse by indifferent performances and lackluster direction by Brad Sykes, previously responsible for the likes of CAMP BLOOD (1999). This isn't a 'fun' movie in the sense that Ed Wood's movies are 'fun' (he, at least, believed in what he was doing and was sincere in his efforts, despite a lack of talent); Sykes' home-made movies are, in fact, aggravating, boring and almost completely devoid of any redeeming virtue, and most viewers will feel justifiably angry and cheated by such unimaginative, badly-conceived junk. The 3-D format is utterly wasted here.",
    "A woman asks for advice on the road to reach a mysterious town, and hears two ghoulish stories from the local weirdo, both zombie related. But perhaps fate has something nasty in store for her too...<br /><br />The Zombie Chronicles is absolutely one of the worst films I have ever seen. In fact I must confess, so bad was it I fast forwarded through most of the garbage. And there was a lot of that, believe me. It runs for just 69 minutes, and there is still tons of filler. You get some skinhead doing a lot of push ups, plenty of dull kissy-kissy scenes between goofy teens (that rhymed, tee hee) and some fine examples of why some people should never become actors.<br /><br />As for the title characters, they barely even have a footnote in the film. Why, you get more undead action in the intro than you do the preceding feature! Though, considering how pathetic the eyes bursting out of sockets and the eating of brains sequences are (amongst other 'delights'), maybe that's a blessing in disguise.<br /><br />And to top it all off, it looks likes it's been filmed on someone's mobile phone for broadcast on Youtube. Jerky camera-work, scratches on the print, flickering lights... I had to rub my eyes when I realised it was made in 2001, and not 1971. Even the clothes and fashioned look about three decades out of date!<br /><br />If you think I'm not qualified to do a review of Chronicles having not seen the whole film, then go ahead. YOU try sitting through it, I betcha you won't even make it to the first appearance of the blue-smartie coloured freaks before making your excuses and leaving. It is truly laughable that anyone chose to release it, and honestly you'll get far more fun resting your drink on the disc than actually torturing your DVD player with this gigglesome excuse for horror. In fact, don't for surprised if it packs it's bags and leaves in the morning, leaving you doomed to watch VHS tapes for the rest of your life. You have been warned... 0/10<br /><br />P.S What kind of 18-rated horror has the woman keep a massive sports bra on during the obligatory sex scene?! See, the movie can't even get that part right...",
    "Really, I can't believe that I spent $5 on this movie. I am a huge zombie fanatic and thought the movie couldn't be that bad. It had zombies in it right? Was I wrong! To be honest the movie had it's moments...I thought it was cool when the guy got his head ripped off but that was about it. Overall I think that it would be more enjoyable to slide down a razorblade slide on my bare nutsack into a vat of vinegar then watch this movie again. The movie could have been better if we could see some boob but I had to watch the trailers for the other movies produced by this company to see that. Buyer beware...unless you are into masochism.",
    "I rented this movie about 3 years ago, and it still stands out in my mind as the worst movie ever made. I don't think I ever finished it. It is worse than a home video made by a high school student. I remember them doing a flashback to 1970 something and in the flashback there was a man with a polo shirt, oakley sunglasses and a newer SUV, like a Toyota Rav-4 or something (I don't remember). I don't understand how they could have possibly said that to be in the 70s. He might have had a cell phone too, I cant remember, It was just horrible. I returned it to the video store and asked them why they even carry the movie and if I could get the hour of my life back. To this day it is the worst movie I have ever seen, and I have seen some pretty bad ones.",
    ":Spoilers:<br /><br />I was very disappointed in Love's Abiding Joy. I had been waiting a really long time to see it and I finally got the chance when it re-aired Thursday night on Hallmark. I love the first three \"Love\" movies but this one was nothing like I thought it was going to be. The whole movie was sad and depressing, there were way to many goofs, and the editing was very poor - to many scenes out of context. I also think the death of baby Kathy happened way to soon and Clarks appearance in the movie just didn't seem to fit. It seemed like none of the actors really wanted to be there - they were all lacking emotion. There seemed to be no interaction between Missie and Willie at all.<br /><br />I think the script writers should have went more by the book. It seems like every movie that's been made so far just slips further and further away from Janette Oke's writings. I mean in the movie they never mentioned a thing about the mine and the two boys or Clark getting hurt because of it. And I think Missie and Willies reactions to Kathy's death could have been shown and heard rather than just heard.<br /><br />Out of the four movies that have been made so far I'd have to say that Love's Abiding Joy is my least favorite. I hope with the next four movies that more of the book is followed and if Clarks character is in them I hope he's got a bigger part and I hope his part isn't so bland. I also hope there is more of Scottie and Cookie and maybe even Marty but who knows what the script writers will have in store next.",
    "I've seen all four of the movies in this series. Each one strays further and further from the books. This is the worst one yet. My problem is that it does not follow the book it is titled after in any way! The directors and producers should have named it any thing other than \"Love's Abiding Joy.\" The only thing about this movie that remotely resembles the book are the names of some of the characters (Willie, Missie, Henry, Clark, Scottie and Cookie). The names/ages/genders of the children are wrong. The entire story line is no where in the book.<br /><br />I find it a great disservice to Janette Oke, her books and her fans to produce a movie under her title that is not correct in any way. The music is too loud. The actors are not convincing - they lack emotions.<br /><br />If you want a good family movie, this might do. It is clean. Don't watch it, though, if you are hoping for a condensed version of the book. I hope that this will be the last movie from this series, but I doubt it. If there are more movies made, I wish Michael Landon, Jr and others would stick closer to the original plot and story lines. The books are excellent and, if closely followed, would make excellent movies!",
    "I very much looked forward to this movie. Its a good family movie; however, if Michael Landon Jr.'s editing team did a better job of editing, the movie would be much better. Too many scenes out of context. I do hope there is another movie from the series, they're all very good. But, if another one is made, I beg them to take better care at editing. This story was all over the place and didn't seem to have a center. Which is unfortunate because the other movies of the series were great. I enjoy the story of Willie and Missy; they're both great role models. Plus, the romantic side of the viewers always enjoy a good love story.",
    "I have read all of the Love Come Softly books. Knowing full well that movies can not use all aspects of the book,but generally they at least have the main point of the book. I was highly disappointed in this movie. The only thing that they have in this movie that is in the book is that Missy's father comes to visit,(although in the book both parents come). That is all. The story line was so twisted and far fetch and yes, sad, from the book, that I just couldn't enjoy it. Even if I didn't read the book it was too sad. I do know that Pioneer life was rough,but the whole movie was a downer. The rating is for having the same family orientation of the film that makes them great.",
    "As a Southern Baptist, it pains me that I must give a below average rating to an overtly Christian movie. There certainly aren't so many that I want to discourage film-makers from a genre that's woefully under-exploited. Still, I must honestly say that \"Love's Abiding Joy\" is a typically low budget, low key, self-consciously Christian film. The plot is predictable, the acting mediocre (I'm being kind), and the editing atrocious. As a TV movie it might have been slightly above average, but as a feature film it leaves much to be desired. Keep trying guys. You've got to have a movie about about real Christians inside you somewhere. Might I suggest you turn to G. K. Chesterton or C. S. Lewis for some inspiration?",
    "As a kid I did think the weapon the murderer wielded was cool, however I was a kid and so I was a bit dumb. Even as a dumb kid though the movies plot was stupid and a bit boring when the killer was not using his light knife to kill people. What amazes me is that the movie has a really solid cast in it. What script did they read when agreeing to be in this movie as it is most assuredly boring and only a means to show off a light saber on a very small scale. The plot at times is incomprehensible and the end is totally chaotic. The whole film seems to rotate around aliens and the one weapon. The plot has two kids and some dude having an alien encounter, flash years later and there seems to be a return as it were in the mix. Dead animals and such to be explored and for some reason the one dude gets the weapon of the aliens and proceeds to use it to go on a very light killing spree. Seriously, you just have to wonder why this movie was made, if you are going to have a killer have some good death scenes, if you are going to have alien encounters show more than a weird light vortex thing, and if you are going to have light sabers then call yourself star wars.",
    "Jill Dunne (played by Mitzi Kapture), is an attractive, nice woman, over-whelmed by a smart-mouthed teenage daughter, Liv (Martha MacIsaac) and a petty, two-timing husband, Sean (Rick Roberts), both of which were tediously self-centered, and obnoxious.<br /><br />This was advertised as a troubled family stalked by a crazed killer during a relentless storm.<br /><br />The storm doesn't even happen until about the last 5 minutes of the film, and then it isn't anything to send anybody running to the storm cellar.<br /><br />The stalking, likewise doesn't get intense until almost the end of the film.<br /><br />Most of the film we spend listening to Jill and her insufferable daughter, Liv, argue until I just wanted to back slap the daughter into next week.<br /><br />Jill's problem with Liv is that she has taken up with Zack, a boy of questionable character, and they are constantly making out--in fact Jill comes home to find the two of them on Liv's bed.<br /><br />The rest of the time we spend listening to Jill's husband Sean either whine at Jill or criticize her.<br /><br />Sean was not at all appealing--since his face is so covered in freckles you could play connect the dots.<br /><br />The story begins with Jill being notified of an out-standing bill on their credit card for a hotel she has never been to, and that she thought Sean had never been to either.<br /><br />Jill goes to the hotel where she meets the owner & manager, Richard Grant (Nick Mancuso), a very nice, older, divorced man, who is sympathetic to her. In fact, when he spots her husband there again, he phones Jill and tips her off.<br /><br />Jill returns to the hotel, sees Sean with another woman. She is upset, leaves without Sean seeing her, and does absolutely nothing. In fact, she doesn't even say anything to Sean when he arrives home.

In fact, he seems a bit more aggressive than necessary, when Jill suddenly decides to cut out.<br /><br />Jill and Sean have a confrontation about his cheating. Sean whines about how Jill has been letting him down since her father died. Apparently his lack of any morals is all her fault. Eventually Jill confesses her own lack of morals and near adultery to Sean--and of course that's all her fault too, as far as Sean is concerned.<br /><br />The little family decides to go on a camping trip--which means more whining and grousing among them, especially from the spoiled daughter.<br /><br />I was so rooting for the stalker to get everybody, but Jill.<br /><br />3 stars",
    "This movie sucked. It really was a waste of my life. The acting was atrocious, the plot completely implausible. Long, long story short, these people get \"terrorized\" by this pathetic \"crazed killer\", but completely fail to fight back in any manner. And this is after they take a raft on a camping trip, with no gear, and show up at a campsite that is already assembled and completely stocked with food and clothes and the daughters headphones. Additionally, after their boat goes missing, they panic that they're stuck in the woods, but then the daughters boyfriend just shows up and they apparently never consider that they could just hike out of the woods like he did to get to them. Like I said, this movie sucks. A complete joke. Don't let your girlfriend talk you into watching it.",
    "Lifetime did it again. Can we say stupid? I couldn't wait for it to end. The plot was senseless. The acting was terrible! Especially by the teenagers. The story has been played a thousand times! Are we just desperate to give actors a job? The previews were attractive and I was really looking for a good thriller.Once in awhile lifetime comes up with a good movie, this isn't one of them. Unless one has nothing else to do I would avoid this one at all cost. This was a waste of two hours of my life. Can I get them back? I would have rather scraped my face against a brick wall for two hours then soaked it in peroxide. That would have been more entertaining.",
    "I have to say I am really surprised at the high ratings for this movie. I found it to be absolutely idiotic. The mother gets \"visions\" when she touches certain things or people? And one thing she touched twice made her vision continue... Just seemed so ridiculous. Deedee Pfieffer's performance was awful I thought. She was very irritating. The girl who played Lori did a good job and so did most of the supporting cast for what they had to work with.<br /><br />I usually love LMN and am very open minded when it comes to movies but this movie seemed to have a ridiculous plot and over the top acting and it just was not for me.",
    "The original book of this was set in the 1950s but that won't do for the TV series because most people watch for the 1930s style. Ironically the tube train near the end was a 1950s train painted to look like a 1930s train so the Underground can play at that game too. Hanging the storyline on a plot about the Jarrow March was feeble but the 50s version had students who were beginning to think about the world around them so I suppose making them think about the poverty of the marchers is much the same thing. All the stuff about Japp having to cater for himself was weak too but they had to put something in to fill the time. This would have made a decent half hour show or they could have filmed the book and made it a better long show. It is obvious this episode is a victim of style over content.",
    "The annoying mouse and lullaby really got to me and really had nothing to do with the story...It's something I would have done my 1st year in film school. Very sad. Additionally, the story just seemed to drag on for no apparent reason...there were too many things just thrown in there that had nothing to do with the story, which makes me feel that the creative team didn't really know what they were doing, or just that it should have been shorter...which would have been a blessing, not a crime. As I have just watched all of the episodes up to this point over the past week...I'd have to say that this was by far the worst, and I just wanted to warn others not to start with this one.",
    "I saw this film opening weekend in Australia, anticipating with an excellent cast of Ledger, Edgerton, Bloom, Watts and Rush that the definitive story of Ned Kelly would unfold before me. Unfortunately, despite an outstanding performance by Heath Ledger in the lead role, the plot was paper thin....which doesn't inspire me to read \"Our Sunshine\". There were some other plus points, the support acting from Edgerton in particular, assured direction from Jordan (confirming his talent on show in Buffalo Soldiers as well), and production design that gave a real feel of harshness to the Australian bush, much as the Irish immigrants of the early 19th century must have seen it. But I can't help feeling that another opportunity has been missed to tell the real story of an Australian folk hero (or was he?)....in what I suspect is a concession to Hollywood and selling the picture in the US. Oh well, at least Jordan and the producers didn't agree to lose the beards just to please Universal...<br /><br />Guess I will just have to content myself with Peter Carey's excellent \"Secret History of the Kelly Gang\". 4/10",
    "I saw this at the premiere in Melbourne<br /><br />It is shallow, two-dimensional, unaffecting and, hard to believe given the subject matter, boring. The actors are passable, but they didn't have much to work with given the very plodding and unimpressive script. For those who might have worried that Ned Kelly would be over-intellectualised, you can take comfort in the fact that this telling of the story is utterly without any literary depth at all, told entirely on the surface and full of central casting standards. However, it doesn't work as a popcorn film either. Its pacing is too off-kilter and its craft is too lacking to satisfy even on the level of a mundane actioner.<br /><br />I very much doubt Gregor Jordan could sit back and say to himself \"this is the best I could have done with the material\".<br /><br />Ned Kelly is a fascinating figure, and equally so is the national response to him. Possibly folk genius, possibly class warrior, possibly psychopath and probably all these things, he has dominated Australian true mythology for over 120 years. Once again, his story has failed miserably on the big screen.<br /><br />Such is life.",
    "Ned Kelly (Ledger), the infamous Australian outlaw and legend. Sort of like Robin Hood, with a mix of Billy the Kid, Australians love the legend of how he stood up against the English aristocratic oppression, and united the lower classes to change Australia forever. The fact that the lower classes of the time were around 70% immigrant criminals seems to be casually skimmed around by this film. Indeed, quite a few so called `facts' in this film are, on reflection, a tad dubious.<br /><br />I suppose the suspicions should have been aroused when, in the opening credits, it was claimed that this film is based upon the book, `Our Sunshine'. If ever a romanticized version of truth could be seen in a name for a book, there it was. This wasn't going to be a historical epic, but just an adaptation of one of many dubious legends of Ned Kelly, albeit a harsh and sporadically brutal version.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Ned Kelly is nothing more than an overblown Hallmark channel `real life historical drama' wannabe! The story plods along at an alarming rate (alarming because never has a film plodded so slowly!) The feeling of numbness after the two hours of pure drivel brought back memories of Costner's awful Wyatt Earp all those years ago. Simply put, nothing happens in the film, but it takes a long time getting to that nothing. This would possibly have been a tad more bearable if the performances were good (because the direction sure as heck wasn't). However, unless you are looking to play a game of spot the worst Oirish accent, then you're gonna be disappointed. Between that, the game of `Who has the stupidest beard?', `Spot the obvious backstabber!' (clue, they are all ginger for some reason), and `Nature in Australia.including lions', it is an experience similar to flicking through Hallmark, The History Channel, Discovery Channel, and Neighbours whilst suffering a huge hangover. Yup, nature pops up a lot, as to fill even more time (possibly an attempt to look arty), the film keeps showing pointless wildlife shots, and once all the native species are shown, here's a circus to allow for a camel and a lion (which is used during one fight to try to make us actually feel more sorry for the lion than the massacred people).<br /><br />This is a turgid, emotionless piece of historical fluff which should have gone straight to TV. There isn't even one good word I can say about this film. Even the usually fantastic Rush seems embarrassed to be here. When one of the characters comments that there is only 2 bullets left for him and his pal, I myself was wishing I had a gun to blow any memory of this film out of my head!",
    "They constructed this one as a kind of fantasy Man From Snowy River meets Butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid, and just for a romantic touch Ned and Joe get to play away with high class talent, the bored young wives of wealthy older men. OK, there are lots of myths about Ned Kelly, but there are also a lot of well documented facts, still leaving space for artistic creativity in producing a good historical dramaticisation. I mean, this is not the Robin Hood story, not the Arthurian legends, not Beowulf, not someone whose life is so shrouded in the mists of many many centuries past that any recreation of their life and times is 99% guesswork. It's only a couple of lifetimes ago. My own grandparents were already of school age when Ned was hanged. <br /><br />So it's silly me for fancifully imagining this movie was a serious attempt to tell the Kelly story. Having recently read Peter Carey's excellent novel \"The True History of the Kelly Gang\" I had eagerly anticipated that this would be in similar vein. But no, the fact is that Mick Jagger's much derided 1970 Kelly was probably far closer to reality, and a better movie overall, which isn't saying a whole lot for it.<br /><br />Glad it only cost me two bucks to hire the DVD! I'll give it 3/10, and that's only because some of the nice shots of the Australian bush make me feel generous.",
    "This has to be the worst piece of garbage I've seen in a while.<br /><br />Heath Ledger is a heartthrob? He looked deformed. I wish I'd known that he and Naomi Watts are an item in real life because I spent 2 of the longest hours of my life wondering what she saw in him. <br /><br />Orlando Bloom is a heartthrob? With the scraggly beard and deer-in-the-headlights look about him, I can't say I agree.<br /><br />Rachel Griffiths was her usual fabulous self, but Geoffrey Rush looked as if he couldn't wait to get off the set. <br /><br />I'm supposed to feel sorry for bankrobbers and murderers? This is a far cry from Butch Cassidy, which actually WAS an entertaining film. This was trite, cliche-ridden and boring. We only stayed because we were convinced it would get better. It didn't.<br /><br />The last 10-15 minutes or so were unintentionally hilarious. Heath and his gang are holed up in a frontier hotel, and women and children are dying because of their presence. That's not funny. But it was funny when they walked out of the hotel with the armor on, because all we could think of was the Black Knight from Monty Python and the Holy Grail. I kept waiting for them to say \"I'll bite yer leg off!\" We were howling with laughter, as were several other warped members of the audience. When we left, pretty much everyone was talking about what a waste of time this film was.<br /><br />I may not have paid cash to see this disaster (sneak preview), but it certainly wasn't free. It cost me 2 hours of my life that I will never get back.",
    "If the term itself were not geographically and semantically meaningless, one might well refer to \"Ned Kelly\" as an \"Australian Western.\" For the people Down Under, Ned Kelly was, apparently, a folk hero bandit akin to Robin Hood, Jesse James, Bonnie and Clyde, and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. The descendant of Irish immigrants, Kelly became a fugitive and an outlaw after he was falsely accused of shooting an Australian law officer, a crime for which his equally innocent mother was put into prison. To get back at the government for this mistreatment, Kelly, his brother Dan, and two other companions, became notorious bank robbers, winning over the hearts of many people in the countryside while striking a blow for justice in a land where Irish immigrants were often treated with disrespect and disdain by those who ran the country.<br /><br />Perhaps because we've encountered this \"gentleman bandit\" scenario so many times in the past, \"Ned Kelly\" feels awfully familiar and unoriginal as it pays homage to any number of the genre's stereotypes and clichés on its way to the inevitable showdown. Ned is the typical heart-of-gold lawbreaker who kills only when he is forced to and, even then, only with the deepest regret. He also has the pulse of the common folk, as when, in the middle of a bank robbery, he returns a valuable watch to one of the customers, after one of his gang has so inconsiderately pilfered it. What movie on this particular subject hasn't featured a scene like that? It's acts of selective generosity like this, of course, that earn him the love and respect of all the little people who come to secretly admire anyone who can get away with sticking it to the powers-that-be and the status quo. Geoffrey Rush plays the typical bedeviled law enforcer who feels a personal stake in bringing down this upstart troublemaker who keeps getting away with tweaking the establishment. There's even the inevitable episode in which one of the ladies being held up goes into the next room and has sex with one of the robbers, so turned on is she by the romantic derring-do of the criminal lifestyle. And the film is riddled with one hackneyed scene like this after another.<br /><br />Heath Ledger fails to distinguish himself in the title role, providing little in the way of substance to make his character either interesting or engaging. It doesn't help that he has been forced to provide a droning voice-over narration that underlines the sanctimoniousness and pretentiousness of both the character and the film.<br /><br />\"Ned Kelly\" might serve a function of sorts as a lesson in Australian history, but as an entertainment, it's just the same old story told with different accents.",
    "This movie was so unrelentingly bad, I could hardly believe I was watching it. The directing, editing, production, and script all seemed as though they had been done by junior high school students who don't know all that much about movies. There was no narrative flow that made any sort of sense. Big emotional moments and climaxes (like one early on between Heath Ledger and Naomi Watts) and character relationships (like one hinted at at the very beginning) come completely out of no where and are not set up like they would have been in a more elegantly and effectively made film. The characters are sadly underdeveloped, making it difficult for us to have any sort of connection with them. The acting, surprisingly, is not entirely bad, but the terrible writing cancels out the relatively convincing performances. The film plays like a particularly bad T.V. western/epic, and sadly diminishes the fascinating (true) story that it attempts to tell. I have read a lot of reviews that defend the film as being important to Australians because of the subject matter. That's all very well, but just because Ned Kelly is an important Australian historical icon DOESN'T MAKE THE MOVIE GOOD. No one is saying that the subject matter isn't good, just the quality of the movie itself. Pearl Harbor was about a very important historical event to Americans, but that doesn't mean I'm going to defend the movie and say it was good, because it was still bad. A failure all around, though Heath and Orlando are lovely to look at.",
    "This movie never made it to theaters in our area, so when it became available on DVD I was one of the first to rent it. For once, I should listened to the critics and passed on this one.<br /><br />Despite the excellent line up of actors the movie was very disappointing. I can see now why it went straight to video. <br /><br />I had thought that with Bloom, Ledger, and Rush it could have some value. All have done wonderful work in the past. <br /><br />The movie was slow moving and never pulled me in. I failed to develop much empathy for the characters and had to fight the urge to fast-forward just to get to the end. <br /><br />I do not recommend this film even if you are thinking of renting it for only for 'eye candy' purposes. It won't satisfy even that.",
    "I thought this was a very clunky, uninvolving version of a famous Australian story. Heath Ledger and Orlando Bloom were very good in their roles, and gave their characters some personality; but the whole thing felt forced and mechanical.<br /><br />The beginning could have been a lot more involving; perhaps starting with a shootout, and then flashing back for a recap of how they got there or that sort of thing. And I felt like every scene was routinely predictable and signposted, like a very bad tv soap.<br /><br />I was really looking forward to this movie, and hoping for something a lot better. The only thing I can say in its favour is that it beats the Mick Jagger version, but not by much.",
    "Ned aKelly is such an important story to Australians but this movie is awful. It's an Australian story yet it seems like it was set in America. Also Ned was an Australian yet he has an Irish accent...it is the worst film I have seen in a long time",
    "From the very beginning, the political theme of this film is so obvious and heavy handed, that the outcome is entirely predictable. Any good textbook on writing screenplays will advise layering of characters, incorporating character arcs, and three act structure. In this film you will find none of that. The police are the baddies, and consequently are shown as shallow, incompetent and cowards. It never seems to occur to the makers of this film that police might be honourable citizens who see joining the police as a good way to contribute to the wellbeing of society.<br /><br />The viewer gets no opportunity to make up his or her mind on whether Ned Kelly is a good guy or a ruthless villain. The film opens with him being arrested for stealing a horse, but we get no clue as to his guilt or innocence. We see him walk through the door of a gaol, but only know that he has been inside for three years when we hear this much later in some dialogue.<br /><br />This film contains many shots of Ned looking at the camera with a serious expression. I found the film a real chore to watch. It is the direction for modern films, and this one put me off watching any more.",
    "I guess I was attracted to this film both because of the sound of the story and the leading actor, so I gave it a chance, from director Gregor Jordan (Buffalo Soldiers). Basically Ned Kelly (Heath Ledger) is set up by the police, especially Superintendent Francis Hare (Geoffrey Rush), he is forced to go on the run forming a gang and go against them to clear his own and his family's names. That's really all I can say about the story, as I wasn't paying the fullest attention to be honest. Also starring Orlando Bloom as Joseph Byrne, Naomi Watts as Julia Cook, Laurence Kinlan as Dan Kelly, Philip Barantini as Steve Hart, Joel Edgerton as Aaron Sherritt, Kiri Paramore as Constable Fitzpatrick, Kerry Condon as Kate Kelly, Emily Browning as Grace Kelly and Rachel Griffiths as Susan Scott. Ledger makes a pretty good performance, for what it's worth, and the film does have it's eye-catching moments, particularly with a gun battle towards the end, but I can't say I enjoyed it as I didn't look at it all. Okay!",
    "I don't quite get the rating for The Amati Girls and I think I was REALLY kind giving it a 4 out of 10. What could otherwise have been a wonderful story with actually a set of more or less decent actors became a total farce in my eyes. There are so many clichés in that flick, the women's hair is just awful and most of the scenes are more than unrealistic or seem fake. There's no real passion in this movie but a bunch of actors over-acting over any limits that it hurts. It's not funny enough to be a comedy, it's too fake-sad to really touch, so in my eyes it's just not good. Watching it I couldn't believe how something like that made it to my TV set in my living room in Switzerland. But.. maybe it still was OK and it just got lost in translation? Who knows. Definitely one of the oddest movies I've ever seen and this certainly not in a good way! Sorry.",
    "This movie was awful. The ending was absolutely horrible. There was no plot to the movie whatsoever. The only thing that was decent about the movie was the acting done by Robert DuVall and James Earl Jones. Their performances were excellent! The only problem was that the movie did not do their acting performances any justice. If the script would have come close to capturing a halfway decent story, it would be worth watching. Instead, Robert DuVall's and James Earl Jones' performances are completely wasted on a god awful storyline...or lack thereof. Not only was I left waiting throughout the movie for something to happen to make the movie....well an actual movie...not just utterless dialog between characters for what ended up being absolutely no reason. It was nothing more than common dialog that would have taken place back in that period of time. There was nothing special about any of the characters. The only thing special was how Robert DuVall portrayed a rambling, senile, drunk, old man. Nothing worthy happens during the entire movie including the end. When the movie ended, I sat amazed...amazed that I sat through the entire movie waiting for something of interest to happen to make watching the movie worth while. It never happened! The cast of characters suddenly started rolling making it apparent that the movie really was over and I realized that I had just wasted 2 hours of my life watching a movie with absolutely no plot and no meaning. It wasn't even a story. The entire movie takes place in a day's worth of time. That's it. It was one day in the life (and death) of some Southerners on a plantation. How much of a story can take place in a single day (other than the movie Training Day)? The acting performances by the entire cast were excellent, but they were grossly wasted on such a disappointment of a movie...if you can even call it a movie.",
    "Holy crap. This was the worst film I have seen in a long time. All the performances are fine, but there is no plot. Really! No plot! A bunch of clowns talk about this and that and that's your film. Ug... Robert Duvall's character is senile and keeps asking the same people the same qestions over and over. This earns him the same responses over and over. I am pretty sure this film got upto a six because people think they should like it. Good performances with famous and well regarded actors, but the actual complete work is a steamy turd. Well, maybe that's a bit deceptive since steam rising from a fresh pile sounds a little like something happening and in this film NOTHING HAPPENS! Sack",
    "SWING! is an important film because it's one of the remaining Black-produced and acted films from the 1930s. Many of these films have simply deteriorated so badly that they are unwatchable, but this one is in fairly good shape. It's also a nice chance to see many of the talented Black performers of the period just after the heyday of the old Cotton Club--a time all but forgotten today.<br /><br />Unfortunately, while the film is historically important and has some lovely performances, it's also a mess. The main plot is very similar to the Hollywood musicals of the era--including a prima donna who is going to ruin the show and the surprise unknown who appears from no where to save the day. However, the writing is just god-awful and a bit trashy at times--and projects images of Black America that some might find a bit demeaning. This is because before the plot really gets going, you are treated to a no-account bum who lives off his hard working wife (a popular stereotype of the time) and when he is caught with a hussy (who, by the way, totally overplays this role), they have a fight which looks like a scene from WWE Smackdown! And, the one lady wants to cut the other lady with a straight razor--a trashy scene indeed! Later in the film, when the prima donna is behaving abominably, her husband punches her in the face and everyone applauds him! It seems like the film, at times, wants to appeal to the lowest common denominator in the audience PLUS they can't even do this well--with some of the worst acting I've seen in a very long time.<br /><br />Still, if you can look past a lousy production in just about every way (with trashy characters, bad acting and direction and poor writing), this one might be worth a peek so you can see excellent singing and tap dancing--as well as to catch a glimpse of forgotten Black culture. Just don't say I didn't warn you about the acting--it's really, really bad!",
    "There's not a drop of sunshine in \"The Sunshine Boys\", which makes the title of this alleged comedy Neil Simon's sole ironic moment. Simon, who adapted the script from his play (which goes uncredited), equates old age with irrational behavior--and, worse, clumsy, galumphing, mean-spirited irrational behavior. Walter Matthau is merciless on us playing an aged vaudeville performer talked into reuniting with former comedy partner George Burns for a television special (it's said they were a team for 43 years, which begs the question \"how long did vaudeville last, anyway?\"). Burns, who won a Supporting Oscar, has the misfortune of coming to the film some thirty minutes in, after which time Matthau has already blasted the material to hell and back. The noisier the movie gets, the less tolerable and watchable it is. Director Herbert Ross only did solid work when he wasn't coupled with one of Neil Simon's screenplays; here, Ross sets up gags like a thudding amateur, hammering away at belligerent routines which fail to pay off (such as semi-incoherent Matthau showing up at a mechanic's garage to audition for a TV commercial). At this point, Matthau was still too young for this role, and he over-compensates by slouching and hollering. It was up to Ross and Simon to tone down the character, to nuance his temperament to give \"The Sunshine Boys\" some sunniness, yet Walter continues to project as if we'd all gone deaf. The picture looks terribly drab and crawls along at a spiritless pace; one loses hope for it early on. *1/2 from ****",
    "I like Goldie Hawn and wanted another one of her films, so when I saw Protocol for $5.50 at Walmart I purchased it. Although mildly amusing, the film never really hits it a stride. Some scenes such as a party scene in a bar just goes on for too long and really has no purpose.<br /><br />Then, of course, there is the preachy scene at the end of the film which gives the whole film a bad taste as far as I'm concerned. I don't think this scene added to the movie at all. I don't like stupid comedies trying to teach me a lesson, written by some '60's burn out especially!<br /><br />In the end, although I'm glad to possess another Hawn movie, I'm not sure it was really worth the money I paid for it!",
    "Protocol is an implausible movie whose only saving grace is that it stars Goldie Hawn along with a good cast of supporting actors. The story revolves around a ditzy cocktail waitress who becomes famous after inadvertently saving the life of an Arab dignitary. The story goes downhill halfway through the movie and Goldie's charm just doesn't save this movie. Unless you are a Goldie Hawn fan don't go out of your way to see this film.",
    "What does the \" Executive producer \" do in a movie . If I remember correctly it's the person who raised the financial backing to make the movie . You might notice in a great number of movies starring Sean Connery that he is also the executive producer which meant Connery himself raised the money since he is a major player . Unfortunately it should also be pointed out that a great number of movies \" starring Sean Connery were solely made because he managed to raise the money since he's a major Hollywood player , it's usually an indication that when the credits read that the executive producer and the star of the movie are one and the same the movie itself is nothing more than a star vehicle with the story/screenplay not being up to scratch <br /><br />PROTOCOL follows the saga of one Sunny Davis a kooky bimboesque cocktail waitress who saves a visiting dignitary and as a reward gets made a top diplomat . Likely ? As things progress Ms Davis ( Who has problems being able to string two sentences together ) finds herself in more outlandish and less likely situations . When I say that PROTOCOL stars Goldie Hawn who is also the film's executive producer do you understand what I'm saying about the story/screenplay not being up to scratch ? Exactly",
    "Outlandish premise that rates low on plausibility and unfortunately also struggles feebly to raise laughs or interest. Only Hawn's well-known charm allows it to skate by on very thin ice. Goldie's gotta be a contender for an actress who's done so much in her career with very little quality material at her disposal...<br /><br />",
    "There are only two movies I would give a 1/10 to, this stinker and \"The Man who Fell to Earth.\" I remember seeing Protocol at a theater in the early 80s when I was in high school. The script is insulting to anyone (including a high school student's) intelligence. It completely lost me with the \"hillarious\" gag of someone getting shot in the butt. Goldie Hawn is supposed to be charming but comes across as vapid and moronic. Then there are offensive stereotypes about Arabs, followed by Goldie winning over everyone by spouting populist dribble. The acting was terrible, including Goldie Hawn's. I could not stand to see another movie she was in until IMO she redeemed herself in Everyone Says I Love You. This is the kind of movie you make if you want to put no effort into screenplay writing. The worst.",
    "The only good thing about this movie was the shot of Goldie Hawn standing in her little french cut bikini panties and struggling to keep a dozen other depraved women from removing her skimpy little cotton top while she giggled and cooed. Ooooof! Her loins rival those of Nina Hartley. This movie came out when I was fourteen and that shot nearly killed me. I'd forgotten about it all tucked away in the naughty Roladex of my mind until seeing it the other day on TV, where they actually blurred her midsection in that scene, good grief, reminding me what a smokin' hottie of a woman Goldie Hawn was in the '80s. Kurt Russell must have had a fun life.",
    "I'm studying Catalan, and was delighted to find El Mar, a movie with mostly Catalan dialogue, at my art-house video store.<br /><br />Hmmm... not so delighted to have seen it.<br /><br />Yes, as other reviewers have said, it's well-made, and beautifully photographed. Although the opening sequence of the children is shockingly violent, it's well-acted and convincing. (For the most part, that is... Would the Mallorquins strip a corpse in preparation for burial right in the middle of the town square, in full view of the dead man's 10-year-old boy?) Oh, well... minor detail. Up to this point, it had something of the feel of a non-magical Pan's Labyrinth, also set in the Spanish Civil War.<br /><br />Fast-forward, and the three children who survived the opening incident have come of age. Francisca is a nun working at a tuberculosis sanatorium and the two boys, Manuel and Ramallo, both are patients. I know, but hey, coincidences happen.<br /><br />The problem, as with so many Spanish movies (apologies to Almodovar fans), is that with one exception (Francisca) the characters are just so dang *weird*. Their motivations, personalities, and dialogue are often simply incoherent.<br /><br />What's more, it descends into some horrific wretched excess. Be prepared for LOTS of pain and LOTS of blood. The reviewer who called it a \"potboiler\" is quite on track. If it had been made 40 years ago, the poster would've said: SEE FORBIDDEN LOVE!! RAPE!! MURDER!! MUTILATION!! FANATICISM!! ANIMAL CRUELTY!! BETRAYAL!! <br /><br />The opening sequence is not nearly enough to make the personalities and relationships of the characters believable. To work, this should have had multiple flashbacks to flesh out the characters. As it is, it seems a bizarre and depressing cross between \"Brother Sun, Sister Moon\" and \"Pulp Fiction.\" If that sounds like something you've got to see, by all means, enjoy. I think I go with something that doesn't make me feel I need to take a shower to wash off the gore and gloom.<br /><br />As for the Catalan, it's the Mallorqui dialect, fairly different than the Barcelona dialect, though I was surprised by the comment that said that even Barcelonans apparently needed Catalan subtitles to understand it.",
    "I was excited to view a Cataluña´s film in the Berlin´s competition. But after the presentation I was total disappointed and furious. Too much blood, too much time, too much themes for nothing. The Spanish Civil War, like every war, was horrible. The revenge, a very human behavior, not pretty at all, is shown in uncountable films and plays, as well as the relations between homosexuals and the scepticism in Spain about Catholicism . But what Mr Villaronga try, is a pseudo tragedy that can belongs to the worst of the film´s history. It is really a pity to see Angela Molina in this movie. I advise nobody under no circumstances to go to see this film.",
    "this film was a major letdown. the level of relentless cruelty and violence in this film was very disturbing. some scenes were truly unnecessarily ugly and mean-spirited. the main characters were impossible to identify with or even sympathize with. the lead protagonist's character was as slimy as they come. the sickroom/hothouse atmosphere lent itself to over-the-top theatrics. little or nothing could be learned about the Spanish civil war from this film. fortunately, i've been to spain and realize this is not realistic! in addition, the use of same-sex attraction as a lurid \"horror\" was also very offensive and poorly handled, while the DVD is being packaged and advertised to attract gay viewers. the actors seemed uncomfortable in their roles,as if they were trying to distance themselves from this mess.i guess if you like watching children and pets being brutally killed,this film might especially appeal to you.",
    "Three part \"horror\" film with some guy in a boarded up house imploring the viewer not to go \"out there\" and (unfortunately) gives us three tales to prove why.<br /><br />The first story involves a young couple in a car accident who meet up with two psychos. It leads up to two totally predictable twists. Still, it's quick (about 15 minutes), violent, well-acted and well-done. Predictable but enjoyable.<br /><br />The second involves a man on the run after stealing a large amount of money. His car breaks down, he's attacked by a dog and stumbles into a nearby clinic. VERY obvious, badly done and extremely slow. Even at 30 minutes this is too long. Good acting though.<br /><br />The third is just barely a horror story. It involves a beautiful, lonely woman looking for Mr. Right. It has beautiful set designs, a nice erotic feel and a nice sex scene. But (again) predictable and not even remotely scary.<br /><br />It ends very stupidly.<br /><br />All in all, the first one is worth watching, but that's it. Tune in for that one then turn it off.",
    "A very cheesy and dull road movie, with the intention to be hip and modern, shown in the editing style and some weird camera angles, resulting only in sleepiness. <br /><br />The cast is wasted, the writing is stupid and pretentious. The only thing worthwhile is the top-notch Lalo Schifrin's soundtrack, really cool and also the opening sequence, very original and interesting. <br /><br />Run if you can, the bad opinions and comments about this flick are totally deserved; it is really pure garbage. Of course that this has its charm, of watching a movie which everybody would not drop the beer glass on if it were on fire, but save it for a stormy day where you have absolutely nothing else to do.",
    "There are some nice shots in this film, it catches some of the landscapes with such a beautiful light, in fact the cinematography is probably it's best asset.<br /><br />But it's basically more of a made for TV movie, and although it has a lot of twists and turns in the plot, which keeps it quite interesting viewing, there are no subtitles and key plot developments are unveiled in Spanish, so non Spanish speakers will be left a little lost.<br /><br />I had it as a Xmas gift, as it's a family trait to work through the films of a actor we find talented, and Matthew Mconaughey was just awesome in \"A Time to kill\" , and the \"The Newton Boys \" so I expressed I wanted to see more of his work.<br /><br />However although it says on the DVD box it is a Matthew Mconaughey film and uses this as a marketing ploy, he has a few lines and is on screen for not very minutes at the end of the film, he is basically an extra and he doesn't exactly light up the screen while he is on, so die hard fans, really not worth it from that point of view.<br /><br />The films star though, Patrick McGaw is great though and very easy on the eye, and his character is just so nice and kind and caring, a true saint of a guy, he'd be well written into a ROM com.<br /><br />So for true Mcconaughey acting brilliance of the ones I've seen, I'd recommend, \"A Time to kill\" , \"The Newton Boys \" \"Frailty\", \"How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days\", \"Edtv\" and \"Amistad\" and avoid too \"Larger Than Life\" and \"Angels in the Outfield\" unless you feel like a kids film or have kids around as neither of these are indicative of his talent, but are quite amusing films for children, again MM is really nothing more that a supporting artist with just a few if any lines.<br /><br />As for Scorpion Springit's not a bad film but it also isn't screen stealing either.",
    "I have been looking for this film for ages because it is quite rare to find as it was one of the video nasties. I finally found it on DVD at the end of last year it is a very low budget movie The story is set around amazon jungle tribes that are living in fear of the devil. Laura Crawford is a model who is kidnapped by a gang of thugs while she is working in South America. They take her into the jungle Laura is guarded by some ridiculous native who calls himself \"The Devil\" she has to go though all unpleasant things until they are happy. Maidens are Chained up. The devil demonstrates eating flesh in a horrible manner. Peter Weston, is the devil hunter, who goes into the jungle to try and rescue her,",
    "As the number of Video Nasties I've yet to see dwindles, this little pile of garbage popped up on my \"to rent\" list when I saw it was available.<br /><br />The premise involves a fashion model or something being kidnapped and taken into the jungle to be held for ransom by a motley crew of idiots. Some other goof gets hired to bring her back and is given a sack of money to use as a bargaining chip, though if he returns with the girl and all the money, he gets a significant cut. He's brought a helicopter and pilot with him and, wow, that pilot is one of the worst actors EVER! Granted, they are all totally terrible and the dubbing will make you cry blood. After stealing away into the jungle, we learn that nearby is a cannibal cult whose flesheating earthbound god wanders the woods like a human King Kong looking for tribeswomen to ravage and devour. Now, this fellow is just a naked guy with some of the worst makeup ever, ping-pong balls for eyes and that's pretty much it. His growls and groans are an everpresent feature on the soundtrack, and I found myself muting much of those scenes.<br /><br />Oh, did I forget to mention the almost constant nudity? This is probably the main reason this film was banned, though there is one specific scene, about one second long, where the god attacks a girl and pulls her guts out, but it's not a redeeming factor for gore fans. Also, Jess Franco goes beyond the usual T and A and shows lengthy close-ups of female genitals, and, sadly, male as well. So, if you want \"fair\" in terms of exploitation, you got it.<br /><br />I can't recommend this trash to anyone. It's not even the good bad movie. It's just atrociously padded trash that only a Video Nasty fan will probably view and even then, if you are making your way through the list, leave this for the very last. If you watch it first, you may get the notion that this is the norm for the list, which is certainly not true.",
    "Not sure if I'm referring to those who labeled this a video nasty or to the director...\"Devil Hunter\" sure is one bizarre 'horror' movie.<br /><br />The plot is a loosey goosey combo of superior films like \"Cannibal Ferox\" and \"Cut and Run.\" Chick gets kidnapped in the 'jungle' by a 'tribe' of 'savages.' The jungle looks more like a park somewhere in Mexico. The tribe is like a group of hippies who walk around in Party City-style Halloween costume renditions of tribal garb. And the savages range in race from white to Asian to black to hispanic. I suppose Franco just grabbed anyone who looked even slightly ethnic for this romp.<br /><br />To make matters worse, this film has ultra-minimal gore, no real scares and a lot of unnecessary penis. Not fun. I can find something to like in just about any sleazy Italian or Euro-trash film; this one just fell WAY short.<br /><br />2 out of 10, kids.",
    "This video nasty was initially banned in Britain, and allowed in last November without cuts.<br /><br />It features the Playboy Playmate of the Month October 1979, Ursula Buchfellner. The opening cuts back and forth between Buchfellner and foggy jungle pictures. I am not sure what the purpose of that was. It would have been much better to focus on the bathtub scene.<br /><br />Laura (Buchfellner) is kidnapped and held in the jungle for ransom. Peter (Al Cliver - The Beyond, Zombie) is sent to find her and the ransom. Of course, one of the kidnappers (Antonio de Cabo) manages to pass the time productively, while another (Werner Pochath) whines incessantly.<br /><br />The ransom exchange goes to hell, and Laura runs into the jungle. Will Peter save her before the cannibals have a meal? Oh, yes, there are cannibals in this jungle. Why do you think it was a video nasty! Muriel Montossé is found by Peter and his partner (Antonio Mayans - Angel of Death) on the kidnapper's boat. Montossé is very comfortably undressed. Peter leaves them and goes off alone to find Laura, who has been captured by now. They pass the time having sex, and don't see the danger approaching. Guts, anyone? Great fight between Peter and the naked devil (Burt Altman).<br /><br />Blood, decapitation, guts, lots of full frontal, some great writhing by the cannibal priestess (Aline Mess), and the line, \"They tore her heart out,\" which is hilarious if you see the film.",
    "Of the three titles from Jess Franco to find their way onto the Official DPP Video Nasty list (Devil Hunter, Bloody Moon and Women Behind Bars) this is perhaps the least deserving of notoriety, being a dreadfully dull jungle clunker enlivened only very slightly by a little inept gore, a gratuitous rape scene, and loads of nudity.<br /><br />Gorgeous blonde Ursula Buchfellner plays movie star Laura Crawford who is abducted by a gang of ruthless kidnappers and taken to a remote tropical island inhabited by a savage tribe who worship the 'devil god' that lurks in the jungle (a big, naked, bulging-eyed native who likes to eat the hearts of nubile female sacrifices).<br /><br />Employed by Laura's agent to deliver a $6million ransom, brave mercenary Peter Weston (Al Cliver) and his Vietnam vet pilot pal travel to the island, but encounter trouble when the bad guys attempt a double-cross. During the confusion, Laura escapes into the jungle, but runs straight into the arms of the island's natives, who offer her up to their god.<br /><br />Franco directs in his usual torpid style and loads this laughable effort with his usual dreadful trademarks: crap gore, murky cinematography, rapid zooms, numerous crotch shots, out of focus imagery, awful sound effects, and ham-fisted editing. The result is a dire mess that is a real struggle to sit through from start to finish (It took me a couple of sittings to finish the thing), and even the sight of the luscious Buchfellner in all of her natural glory ain't enough to make me revisit this film in a hurry.",
    "How can you tell that a horror movie is terrible? when you can't stop laughing about it of course! The plot has been well covered by other reviewers, so I'll just add a few things on the hilarity of it all.<br /><br />Some reviews have placed the location in South America, others in Africa, I thought it was in some random island in the Pacific. Where exactly does this take place, seems to be a mystery. The cannibal tribe is conformed by a couple of black women some black men, and a man who looks like a young Frank Zappa banging the drums... the Devil God is a large black man with a terrible case of pink eyes.<br /><br />One of the \"freakiest\" moments in the film is when, \"Pablito\" find his partner hanging from a tree covered in what seems to be an orange substance that I assume is blood, starts screaming for minutes on and on (that's actually funny), and then the head of his partner falls in the ground and \"Pablito\" kicks it a bit for what I assume is \"shits n' giggles\" and the eyes actually move...<br /><br />But, of course, then the \"freak\" is gone when you realize the eyes moved because the movie is just bad...<br /><br />I hadn't laughed like this in a loooong while, and I definitely recommend this film for a Sunday afternoon with your friends and you have nothing to do... grab a case of beers and start watching this film, you'll love it! If you are looking for a real horror or gore movie, though... don't' bother.",
    "An actress making a movie in Africa is kidnapped and taken into the jungle where she is held for ransom. The producer hires some one to go and bring her back. Complicating everything are the cannibals in the jungle who worship a really ugly looking \"god\" who likes to eat naked women.<br /><br />This is a gory sleazy movie. There is copious amounts of nudity and violence, not to mention violence against nude people. Its an exploitation film designed to appeal to the deepest darkest parts of our being, and if the movie wasn't so boring this film would be a classic. Lets face it, despite the gore, the nasty sex and abuse,and the ugly monster this movie is a snoozer. The pacing is all off kilter and it puts you out. There are multiple plot lines that all seem to be happening separately from each other, even though its ultimately all one story. Worst of all, almost no one says anything. Most of the minimal dialog concerns the cruelty or one characters protestations that \"I'll do what I want\". Its such a quiet and dull movie that if it weren't for the frequent screams of the victims I'd recommend this as a sleep aide.<br /><br />This is a movie to avoid unless you need sleep, or unless you need to see every Euro-cannibal movie.<br /><br />(An aside. VideoAsia just released this as part of their Terror Tales series. Their print is oddly letter-boxed which looks to be the result of taking their print from a Japanese source (there is fogging) that was cropped to remove the subtitles. Their print also has no opening titles)",
    "or anyone who was praying for the sight of Al Cliver wrestling a naked, 7ft tall black guy into a full nelson, your film has arrived! Film starlet Laura Crawford (Ursula Buchfellner) is kidnapped by a group who demand the ransom of $6 million to be delivered to their island hideaway. What they don't count on is rugged Vietnam vet Peter Weston (Cliver) being hired by a film producer to save the girl. And what they really didn't count on was a local tribe that likes to offer up young women to their monster cannibal god with bloodshot bug eyes.<br /><br />Pretty much the same filming set up as CANNIBALS, this one fares a bit better when it comes to entertainment value, thanks mostly a hilarious dub track and the impossibly goofy monster with the bulging eyes (Franco confirms they were split ping pong balls on the disc's interview). Franco gets a strong EuroCult supporting cast including Gisela Hahn (CONTAMINATION) and Werner Pochath (whose death is one of the most head-scratching things I ever seen as a guy who is totally not him is shown - in close up - trying to be him). The film features tons of nudity and the gore (Tempra paint variety) is there. The highlight for me was the world's slowly fistfight between Cliver and Antonio de Cabo in the splashing waves. Sadly, ol' Jess pads this one out to an astonishing (and, at times, agonizing) 1 hour and 40 minutes when it should have run 80 minutes tops. <br /><br />For the most part, the Severin DVD looks pretty nice but there are some odd ghosting images going on during some of the darker scenes. Also, one long section of dialog is in Spanish with no subs (they are an option, but only when you listen to the French track). Franco gives a nice 16- minute interview about the film and has much more pleasant things to say about Buchfellner than his CANNIBALS star Sabrina Siani.",
    "Devil Hunter gained notoriety for the fact that it's on the DPP 'Video Nasty' list, but it really needn't have been. Many films on the list where there for God (and DPP) only known reasons, and while this isn't the tamest of the bunch; there isn't a lot here that warrants banning...which is a shame because I never would have sat through it where it not for the fact that it's on 'the shopping list'. The plot actually gives the film a decent base - or at least more of a decent base than most cannibal films - and it follows an actress who is kidnapped and dragged off into the Amazon jungle. A hunter is then hired to find her, but along the way he has to brave the natives, lead by a man who calls himself \"The Devil\" (hence the title). The film basically just plods along for eighty five minutes and there really aren't many scenes of interest. It's a real shame that Jess Franco ended up making films like this because the man clearly has talent; as seen by films such as The Diabolical Dr Z, Venus in Furs, Faceless and She Kills in Ecstasy, but unfortunately his good films are just gems amongst heaps of crap and Devil Hunter is very much a part of the crap. I saw this film purely because I want to be able to say I've seen everything on the DPP's list (just two more to go!), and I'm guessing that's why most other people who have seen it, saw it. But if you're not on the lookout for Nasties; there really is no reason to bother with this one.",
    "This film seemed way too long even at only 75 minutes. The problem with jungle horror films is that there is always way too much footage of people walking (through the jungle, up a rocky cliff, near a river or lake) to pad out the running time. The film is worth seeing for the laughable and naked native zombie with big bulging, bloody eyes which is always accompanied on the soundtrack with heavy breathing and lots of reverb. Eurotrash fans will be plenty entertained by the bad English dubbing, gratuitous female flesh and very silly makeup jobs on the monster and native extras. For a zombie/cannibal flick this was pretty light on the gore but then I probably didn't see an uncut version.",
    "Not only is it a disgustingly made low-budget bad-acted movie, but the plot itself is just STUPID!!!<br /><br />A mystic man that eats women? (And by the looks, not virgin ones)<br /><br />Ridiculous!!! If you´ve got nothing better to do (like sleeping) you should watch this. Yeah right.",
    "This is the worst thing the TMNT franchise has ever spawned. I was a kid when this came out and I still thought it was deuce, even though I liked the original cartoon.<br /><br />There's this one scene I remember when the mafia ape guy explains to his minions what rhetorical questions are. It's atrocious. Many fans hate on the series for including a female turtle, but that didn't bother me. So much so that I didn't even remember her until I read about the show recently. All in all, it's miserably forgettable.<br /><br />The only okay thing was the theme song. Guilty pleasure, they call it... Nananana ninja...",
    "This is the biggest insult to TMNT ever. Fortunantely, officially Venus does not exist in canon TMNT. There will never be a female turtle, this took away from the tragic tale of 4 male unique mutants who will never have a family of their own, once gone no more. The biggest mistake was crossing over Power Rangers to TMNT with a horrible episode; the turtle's voices were WRONG and they all acted out of character. They could have done such a better job, better designs and animatronics and NO VENUS. <br /><br />don't bother with this people...it's cringe worthy material. the lip flap was slow and unnatural looking. they totally disrespected shredder. the main baddie, some dragonlord dude was corny. the turtles looked corny with things hanging off their bodies, what's with the thing around raph's thigh? the silly looking sculpted plastrons!? <br /><br />If they looked normal, acted in character and got rid of Venus, got rid of the stupid kiddie cartoon sounds...and better writing it could have been good.",
    "I did not like the idea of the female turtle at all since 1987 we knew the TMNT to be four brothers with their teacher Splinter and their enemies and each one of the four brothers are named after the great artists name like Leonardo , Michelangleo, Raphel and Donatello so Venus here doesn't have any meaning or playing any important part and I believe that the old TMNT series was much more better than that new one which contains Venus As a female turtle will not add any action to the story we like the story of the TMNT we knew in 1987 to have new enemies in every part is a good point to have some action but to have a female turtle is a very weak point to have some action, we wish to see more new of TMNT series but just as the same characters we knew in 1987 without that female turtle.",
    "This film is terrible. You don't really need to read this review further. If you are planning on watching it, suffice to say - don't (unless you are studying how not to make a good movie).<br /><br />The acting is horrendous... serious amateur hour. Throughout the movie I thought that it was interesting that they found someone who speaks and looks like Michael Madsen, only to find out that it is actually him! A new low even for him!!<br /><br />The plot is terrible. People who claim that it is original or good have probably never seen a decent movie before. Even by the standard of Hollywood action flicks, this is a terrible movie.<br /><br />Don't watch it!!! Go for a jog instead - at least you won't feel like killing yourself.",
    "Terrible movie. Nuff Said.<br /><br />These Lines are Just Filler. The movie was bad. Why I have to expand on that I don't know. This is already a waste of my time. I just wanted to warn others. Avoid this movie. The acting sucks and the writing is just moronic. Bad in every way. The only nice thing about the movie are Deniz Akkaya's breasts. Even that was ruined though by a terrible and unneeded rape scene. The movie is a poorly contrived and totally unbelievable piece of garbage.<br /><br />OK now I am just going to rag on IMDb for this stupid rule of 10 lines of text minimum. First I waste my time watching this offal. Then feeling compelled to warn others I create an account with IMDb only to discover that I have to write a friggen essay on the film just to express how bad I think it is. Totally unnecessary.",
    "Assuming this won't end up a straight-to-video release, I would have to say void this title at all costs. Unless you're bored of good, well-executed movies, that is. I saw this last night at AFI Dallas, and I left with 20 minutes remaining, simply because I didn't care anymore (about the plot, not about insulting the director...that is awkward). When you can spot a goof only 5 minutes into the movie (a shot out, shattered window before any shots are fired...and then the window breaks with the first shot), things are going to bad. Let's just say this is only an indicator of things to come...unfortunately.<br /><br />I'll spare you all the details, but this is sub-par in every manner, even the half-assed acting by Michael Madsen is disappointing when you're expecting half-assed acting from him. And the rape scene...Christ! \"Shut up and take it\" should never be used in a rape scene. EVER.<br /><br />3/10",
    "Sometimes a movie is so comprehensively awful it has a destructive effect on your morale. You begin to really ask yourself, what does it mean for our society that the standard is so terribly low? Can they honestly expect that we'll endure this many clichés and still be entertained?<br /><br />Of course, it is still a Hollywood mainstay to make the GUN the major character, plot device, and the source of all conflict and resolution in films. Character needs a gun. Gets a gun. Can't do that because he has a gun. Puts his gun down first. OH MY GOD What are we going to do!? He has a gun! He waves it around, acting more malicious than real human beings ever do. He pushes it in someone's face for 90 minutes, shouting questions. The hallmark of any conclusion will be the comforting sound of police sirens. <br /><br />It's a real challenge to make such a tired, hackneyed formula work again; a film has to be very clever and well executed. This one is neither. It has no life and no personality, and it will suck these components from YOU. it will make you feel WORSE about living in the time and space that you do. Really, who needs that!? So yes, I'll say it: I think this may well be the worst film I have ever seen. Anyone who was involved in the making of this sub- mediocre soul killing trash should be publicly embarrassed for the disservice they've done to us all.",
    "I have to congratulate the genius who approved this one. Edward Furlong, you're not as good as you think mate, you can't grab on every piece of low-cost amateur crap, which sole intention has to be to get some bucks.<br /><br />The filming is bad, and I mean BAD. Anyone with a camera would get the same result, or better.<br /><br />The acting, lets just say: don't go to the supermarket looking for actors. The good ones usually come with a degree or, at least, have some damn experience! The director.. Mr. Jon Keeyes, please find your purpose in life, as a director you simply suck. Your directing is poor, the angles are all messed up (not in a good way), the lines seem as if they're being read out of toilet paper, and the damn music.. it always comes up when it shouldn't and goes out for no apparent reason. And don't go for writer either, by the way. Making movies isn't like serving on a coffeshop, it requires art and skill, things I really doubt you'll ever have.<br /><br />Instead of making a badass shootout movie, you should've shot this one back to oblivion and wait 'till something good came up.. Or just go find a job on a coffeshop. You'll have less stress and you'll save movie goers some money and a bad night.<br /><br />vote: 1/10 (my first one)",
    "I rented this one on DVD without any prior knowledge. I was suspicious seeing Michael Madsen appearing in a movie I have never heard of, but it was a freebie, so why not check it out.<br /><br />Well my guess is that Mr. Blonde would very much like to forget he's ever taken part in such a shame of a film.<br /><br />Apparently, if your script and dialogs are terrible, even good actors cannot save the day. Not to mention the amateur actors that flood this film. Too many non-native-English-speakers play parts of native-English-speakers, reading out lines from a script that should have been thrown away and not having been made into a movie. It's unbelievable how unbelievable all the lines in the movie sound. The music is awful and totally out of place, and the whole thing looks and sounds like a poor school play.<br /><br />I recommend you watch it just so you would appreciate other, better, movies. This is why I gave it a 3 instead of the 1 it deserves.",
    "I saw this DVD in my friends house and thought that this was a Turkish action movie with some Hollywood-not very big-names in it. Interested enough I decide to give it a shot later.. It was a tough to bear experience believe me. Then, after finally seeing the credits roll I tought 'We Turks really suck at Hollywood style film making.. This is an insult to the heist|hostage movie genre..' but then wait! I checked some names and no, they were not Turkish names and no, this was not a Turkish movie; on the contrary it was literally shot in America with an American director & crew! That made me thinking-again!- How on earth can you persuade names like Micheal Madsen, Edward Furlong or even Arnold Vosloo to take part in such a project? with money probably.. That kept me thinking further.. How can you raise such amount of money to offer them and a supposedly international cast? Then all my meditation paid off and I came to find the answer.By hiring the cheapest equipment and crew that you can find. And if you still have to difficulty in adjustin your budget then: by writing and directing the movie you are trying to produce-or vice versa I don't have any information on that-. So bottom line this is not a bad movie as everybody are so anxious to present as.. It makes you think -in my case even meditate- and there are a lot of movies outthere that doesn't give even that affect.. This one at least makes you think; It makes you wonder.. It leaves you with disbelief.. and then It makes you wonder again..",
    "What was with all the Turkish actors? No offense but I thought it was all for nothing for all these actors. The film had no script to test any actors acting skill or ability. It demanded next to nothing I bought this film to see Michael Madsen. He is one of my favorite actors but this film was another failure for him. The script was so bad. Their was just nothing to sink your teeth into and all the characters were two dimensional. Madsen tried to act like a hard ass but the script and direction didn't even allow him to do enough with his character to make it more interesting or 3 dimensional.<br /><br />Even the sound effects of the gunfight at the beginning of the film sounded like the noise of paint ball guns when they are fired in a skirmish. It was really weird and they didn't sound like real guns. A video game had better sound effects than this film. There was also a really annoying bloke at the beginning of the film who was a member of the robbery gang. He had this American whining voice like a girl shouting lines like \"Lets get the F#$k out of here\" and What are we going to do man\". He sounded like a girl. As a positive It was funny to watch and it made me laugh too. For a few seconds. Whoo Hoo ! Dumb Film. Poor Madsen. He will bounce back...",
    "This movie was terrible. at first i just read the plot summary and it looked OK, so i watched it. The acting was TERRIBLE. it was like the actor were almost camera shy. everything seemed fake. i feel bad for Edward Furlong, terminator 2 was my favorite a few years ago.. I've watched it at least 20 times....<br /><br />the plot was also crap. the writers were probably sleep deprived when they came up with the lines.<br /><br />on the plus side, it's the good kind of bad movie. the one you keep watching just to see how much worst could it will get, so that later you can tell other people how you couldn't believe how terrible the movie was.<br /><br />i think everybody should watch this, so that then we could appreciate better other, REAL, movies.",
    "I am a big fan of Arnold Vosloo. Finally seeing him as the star of a recent movie, not just a bit part, made me happy.<br /><br />Unfortunately I took film appreciation in college and the only thing I can say that I didn't like was that the film was made in an abandoned part of town and there was no background traffic or lookie loos.<br /><br />I have to say that the acting leaves something to be desired, but Arnold is an excellent actor, I have to chalk it up to lousy direction and the supporting cast leaves something to be desired.<br /><br />I love Arnold Vosloo, and he made the film viewable. Otherwise, I would have written it off as another lousy film.<br /><br />I found the rape scene brutal and unnecessary, but the actors that got away at the end were pretty good. But the sound effects of the shoot-out were pretty bad. There are some glitches in the film (continuity) but they are overlookable considering the low-caliber of the film.<br /><br />All in all I enjoyed the film, because Arnold Vosloo was in it.<br /><br />Jackie",
    "This is an art film that was either made in 1969 or 1972 (the National Film Preservation Foundation says 1969 and IMDb says 1972). Regardless of the exact date, the film definitely appears to be very indicative of this general time period--with some camera-work and pop art stylings that are pure late 60s-early 70s.<br /><br />The film consists of three simple images that are distorted using different weird camera tricks. These distorted images are accompanied by music and there is absolutely no dialog or plot of any sort. This was obviously intended as almost like a form of performance art, and like most performance art, it's interesting at first but quickly becomes tiresome. The film, to put it even more bluntly, is a total bore and would appeal to no one but perhaps those who made the film, their family and friends and perhaps a few people just too hip and \"with it\" to be understood by us mortals.",
    "Nine minutes of psychedelic, pulsating, often symmetric abstract images, are enough to drive anyone crazy. I did spot a full-frame eye at the start, and later some birds silhouetted against other colors. It was just not my cup of tea. It's about 8½ minutes too long.",
    "There are lots of extremely good-looking people in this movie. That's probably the best thing about it. Perhaps that even makes it worth watching.<br /><br />\"Loaded\" tells the story of Tristan Price (Jesse Metcalfe), a young man who's about to make his mark on the world. He's the son of a well-to-do family with a good reputation, and he's on his way to law school. But like so many such settings, things aren't quite as perfect as they appear. The expectations in this family far outweigh the love. Except for school, Tristan's father rarely lets him leave the house. This seems to be the result of some past traumatic event that shook the family, which is partially revealed through flashbacks but isn't spelled out until the very end. Tristan's claustrophobic environment causes him to let loose in very extreme ways at the first possible opportunity, when his friends take him out to a strip club to celebrate his graduation. The celebration soon follows some strippers back to a beach house party, and from there, Tristan befriends Sebastian Cole (Corey Large), who pulls him into a drug dealing underworld.<br /><br />While technically well-made, this movie suffers from a lackluster script and a storyline that isn't very engaging. Also counting against this film are some constant camera tricks that generally seemed annoying and out-of-place, such as slow-motion, fast-motion, freeze-frames and echos. These are the types of effects a director might normally utilize to show a character's perspective while on drugs, except in this case they seem to have been sporadically tossed in at random points, in some cheap attempt at style.<br /><br />Despite its cast of relative unknowns, performances were good all around, most notably with respect to the main antagonist (Corey Large). I suspect we'll be seeing at least a couple of these people in bigger and better projects in the future.<br /><br />Of course, when mentioning the actors, I must mention their looks. Rating based on hotness, this movies scores an 11. The women in this movie are incredible-looking and almost distract you from what a boring movie you're watching. I'm sure the male characters are also quite attractive, but you'll have to ask someone else to comment on that.<br /><br />Overall, I can't recommend this movie, not for buying, renting, or even seeing for free. It's unfortunately just not worth the effort it takes to sit through.",
    "This is it. This is the one. This is the worst movie ever made. Ever. It beats everything. I have never seen worse. Retire the trophy and give it to these people.....there's just no comparison.<br /><br />Even three days after watching this (for some reason I still don't know why) I cannot believe how insanely horrific this movie is/was. Its so bad. So far from anything that could be considered a movie, a story or anything that should have ever been created and brought into our existence.<br /><br />This made me question whether or not humans are truly put on this earth to do good. It made me feel disgusted with ourselves and our progress as a species in this universe. This type of movie sincerely hurts us as a society. We should be ashamed. I really cannot emphasize that our global responsibility as people living here and creating art, is that we need to prevent the creation of these gross distortions of our reality for our own good. It's an embarrassment. I don't know how on earth any of these actors, writers, or the director of this film sleeps at night knowing that they had a role in making \"Loaded\". I don't know what type of disgusting monsters enjoy watching these types of movies.<br /><br />That being said, I love a good \"bad\" movie. I love Shark Attack 3, I love Bad Taste, they are HILARIOUS. I tell all my friends to see them because they are \"bad\".<br /><br />But this.......this crosses the line of \"bad\" into a whole new dimension. This is awkward bad. This is the bad where you know everything that is going to happen, every line, every action, every death, every sequence BEFORE they happen; and not just like a second or two before, I mean like, after watching the first 5 minutes before.<br /><br />Every cheesy editing \"effect\" is shamelessly used over and over again to a sickening point. I really never want to see the \"shaky\" camera \"drug buzz rush\" effect or jump cuts or swerve cuts or ANY FANCY CUT EVER AGAIN EVER. This is meticulously boring, repetitive and just tortures the audience.<br /><br />But.......and let me be specific here, the most DISTURBING thing about this movie is that given the production, it appears that a somewhat decent amount of money was actually put into this excrement. I personally will grab the shoulders of the director if I ever see him and shake him into submission, demanding that he run home and swallow two-gallons of Drain-O or I will do it for him.<br /><br />If we ever needed a new form of inhumane torture for our war prisoners abroad, just keep showing them this movie in a padded cell over and over again. Trust me, I think they will become more extravagant with suicide methods after the 72nd time of sitting through this.<br /><br />Stop these movies, they are just the most vile of all facets of our society. Please. Stop. NOW.",
    "There are times when finishing a film one wishes to have a refund for the time just spent. This was one of those times. I almost gave up with only 15 minutes left to endure... and I wish I had...<br /><br />The pace that a man goes from a straight-laced, controlled life to one of complete spinelessness and irresponsibility could never be this rapid.<br /><br />From a graduation celebration to the predictable ending Tristan Price (Jesse Metcalfe) man of privilege and culture allows himself to be seduced by a woman, by violence, and by mind altering substances. Of course, the woman part is understandable when observing the talents of the beautiful April (Nathalie Kelley). But the in for a penny in for a pound aspect of the drugs, violence and dedication to a person he has just met is impossible to understand.<br /><br />Frankly, besides being able to stare at Nathalie Kelley and Monica Keena, this film has no redeeming qualities. Save your money, save your time... do anything else...",
    "Weak plot, predictable violence, only semi interesting characters. Like the writer (also one of the stars?) was fictionalizing his own screw ups and added an incredulous fantasies of drugs and murder to make it \"hot\". From the predictable rap and house soundtrack, to the family conflicts, it's poorly acted, stereotypical, and ultimately terribly boring. Even the title has been done before - IMDb lists FIVE movies with the same name released in 2007-2008!! <br /><br />Note: Saw it on Showtime, which listed the synopsis for one of the other movies. Was halfway thru before I realized no one was an undercover cop. Even tho another stereotype, would have made it interesting if it happened.",
    "All I could think of while watching this movie was B-grade slop. Many have spoken about it's redeeming quality is how this film portrays such a realistic representation of the effects of drugs and an individual and their subsequent spiral into a self perpetuation state of unfortunate events. Yet really, the techniques used (as many have already mentioned) were overused and thus unconvincing and irrelevant to the film as a whole.<br /><br />As far as the plot is concerned, it was lacklustre, unimaginative, implausible and convoluted. You can read most other reports on this film and they will say pretty much the same as I would.<br /><br />Granted some of the actors and actresses are attractive but when confronted with such boring action... looks can only carry a film so far. The action is poor and intermittent: a few punches thrown here and there, and a final gunfight towards the end. Nothing really to write home about.<br /><br />As others have said, 'BAD' movies are great to watch for the very reason that they are 'bad', you revel in that fact. This film, however, is a void. It's nothing.<br /><br />Furthermore, if one is really in need of an educational movie to scare people away from drug use then I would seriously recommend any number of other movies out there that board such issues in a much more effective way. 'Requiem For A Dream', 'Trainspotting', 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' and 'Candy' are just a few examples. Though one should also check out some more lighthearted films on the same subject like 'Go' (overall, both serious and funny) and 'Halfbaked'.<br /><br />On a final note, the one possibly redeeming line in this movie, delivered by Vinnie Jones was stolen from 'Lock, Stock and Two Smokling Barrels'. To think that a bit of that great movie has been tainted by 'Loaded' is vile.<br /><br />Overall, I strongly suggest that you save you money and your time by NOT seeing this movie.",
    "If you look at Corey Large's information here on IMDb, apparently there's a movie called \"Reload\" in production (as of June '08) in which he's playing a character named Sebastian Cole.<br /><br />First of all, how does such a crappy movie ever earn a sequel ... and second, didn't Sebastian get killed at the end of \"Loaded\"?<br /><br />I watched this in the wee hours of the morning when I was battling insomnia, and so I was drifting in and out while it was on. I'm sure I missed some plot points, but overall, it seemed really weak. Large's performance was (for me) one of the stronger parts of the film. I'm also a bit surprised at all the people commenting on the beautiful girls, since I thought the actress playing Brooke was pretty, but not exceptional.",
    "This film had a lot of promise, and the plot was relatively interesting, however the actors, director and editors seriously let this film down.<br /><br />I feel bad for the writers, it could have been good. The acting is wooden, very few of the characters are believable.<br /><br />Who ever edited this clearly just learnt some new edit techniques and wanted to splash them all over the film. There are lots of quick 'flashy' edits in almost every scene, which are clearly meant to be symbolic but just end up as annoying.<br /><br />I wanted to like this film and expected there to be a decent resolution to the breakdown of equilibrium but alas no, it left me feeling like I'd wasted my time and the film makers had wasted their money.",
    "This is one of the dumbest films, I've ever seen. It rips off nearly ever type of thriller and manages to make a mess of them all.<br /><br />There's not a single good line or character in the whole mess. If there was a plot, it was an afterthought and as far as acting goes, there's nothing good to say so Ill say nothing. I honestly cant understand how this type of nonsense gets produced and actually released, does somebody somewhere not at some stage think, 'Oh my god this really is a load of shite' and call it a day. Its crap like this that has people downloading illegally, the trailer looks like a completely different film, at least if you have download it, you haven't wasted your time or money Don't waste your time, this is painful.",
    "6/10 Acting, not great but some good acting.<br /><br />4/10 Director, makes some stupid decisions for this film.<br /><br />2/10 Writer, story makes no sense at all and has huge amount of flaws.<br /><br />4/10 Overall score for this movie.<br /><br />Don't waste your time with this film, it's not worth it. I gave 4 for this movie and it may be too much. Characters are so over exaggerated than they can ever be in real life and some pretty unexplainable stuff happens \"storywise\", not in good way. Because of the style this film has been filmed you get bored after 30 minutes (too many special effects: slow motions and camera shakes and fast forwards). It's always good that movie uses music to make the story go smooth but there's too many tracks in this one. In the first hour there is almost 50/50 dialogs and musics",
    "This is really a new low in entertainment. Even though there are a lot worse movies out.<br /><br />In the Gangster / Drug scene genre it is hard to have a convincing storyline (this movies does not, i mean Sebastians motives for example couldn't be more far fetched and worn out cliché.) Then you would also need a setting of character relationships that is believable (this movie does not.) <br /><br />Sure Tristan is drawn away from his family but why was that again? what's the deal with his father again that he has to ask permission to go out at his age? interesting picture though to ask about the lack and need of rebellious behavior of kids in upper class family. But this movie does not go in this direction. Even though there would be the potential judging by the random Backflashes. Wasn't he already down and out, why does he do it again? <br /><br />So there are some interesting questions brought up here for a solid socially critic drama (but then again, this movie is just not, because of focusing on \"cool\" production techniques and special effects an not giving the characters a moment to reflect and most of all forcing the story along the path where they want it to be and not paying attention to let the story breath and naturally evolve.) <br /><br />It wants to be a drama to not glorify abuse of substances and violence (would be political incorrect these days, wouldn't it?) but on the other hand it is nothing more then a cheap action movie (like there are so so many out there) with an average set of actors and a Vinnie Jones who is managing to not totally ruin what's left of his reputation by doing what he always does.<br /><br />So all in all i .. just ... can't recommend it.<br /><br />1 for Vinnie and 2 for the editing.",
    "From the beginning of the movie, it gives the feeling the director is trying to portray something, what I mean to say that instead of the story dictating the style in which the movie should be made, he has gone in the opposite way, he had a type of move that he wanted to make, and wrote a story to suite it. And he has failed in it very badly. I guess he was trying to make a stylish movie. Any way I think this movie is a total waste of time and effort. In the credit of the director, he knows the media that he is working with, what I am trying to say is I have seen worst movies than this. Here at least the director knows to maintain the continuity in the movie. And the actors also have given a decent performance.",
    "I basically skimmed through the movie but just enough to catch watch the plot was about. To tell you the truth it was kind of boring to me and at some spots it didn't make sense. The only reason I watched this movie in the first place was to see CHACE CRAWFORD!!! He is so hot, but in this movie his hair was kind of weird. But still hot.<br /><br />However, despite how hot CHACE is, it really did not make up for the film. I guess the plot isn't that bad but what really threw me over was the fact that they cuss in like every sentence. Is it that hard to express your anger without saying the F word every time?The cussing was annoying and the whole flashy, camera shaking thing gave me a headache.<br /><br />All in all, although the plot was OK, I found the film to be a bore and over dramatic. That's why I only cut to scenes with CHACE in it. LOL Anyways, not worth renting unless your a die-hard fan of a specific cast member like I was. Oh yeah the cast was Hot. The girls were HOT!!! But CHACE IS THE BEST!!",
    "This fanciful horror flick has Vincent Price playing a mad magician that realizes his vocational talents have been sold to another. He devise ways of avenging all those that have wronged him. His master scheme seems to back fire on him.<br /><br />Price is a little below par compared to his masterpieces, but is still the only reason to watch this thriller. Supporting cast includes Patrick O'Neal, Mary Murphy, Eva Gabor and Jay Novello.<br /><br />",
    "If I had not read Pat Barker's 'Union Street' before seeing this film, I would have liked it. Unfortuntately this is not the case. It is actually my kind of film, it is well made, and in no way do I want to say otherwise, but as an adaptation, it fails from every angle.<br /><br />The harrowing novel about the reality of living in a northern England working-class area grabbed hold of my heartstrings and refused to let go for weeks after I had finished. I was put through tears, repulsion, shock, anger, sympathy and misery when reading about the women of Union Street. Excellent. A novel that at times I felt I could not read any more of, but I novel I simply couldn't put down. Depressing yes, but utterly gripping.<br /><br />The film. Oh dear. Hollywood took Barker's truth and reality, and showered a layer of sweet icing sugar over the top of it. A beautiful film, an inspiring soundtrack, excellent performances, a tale of hope and romance...yes. An adaptation of 'Union Street'...no.<br /><br />The women of Union Street and their stories are condensed into Fonda's character, their stories are touched on, but many are discarded. I accept that some of Barker's tales are sensitive issues and are too horrific for mass viewing, and that a film with around 7 leading protagonists just isn't practical, but the content is not my main issue. The essence and the real gut of the novel is lost - darkness and rain, broken windows covered with cardboard, and the graphically described stench of poverty is replaced with sunshine, pretty houses, and a twinkling William's score.<br /><br />If you enjoyed the film for its positivity and hope in the face of 'reality', I advise that you hesitate to read the book without first preparing yourself for something more like 'Schindler's List'...but without the happy ending.",
    "I saw the capsule comment said \"great acting.\" In my opinion, these are two great actors giving horrible performances, and with zero chemistry with one another, for a great director in his all-time worst effort. Robert De Niro has to be the most ingenious and insightful illiterate of all time. Jane Fonda's performance uncomfortably drifts all over the map as she clearly has no handle on this character, mostly because the character is so poorly written. Molasses-like would be too swift an adjective for this film's excruciating pacing. Although the film's intent is to be an uplifting story of curing illiteracy, watching it is a true \"bummer.\" I give it 1 out of 10, truly one of the worst 20 movies for its budget level that I have ever seen.",
    "Robert DeNiro plays the most unbelievably intelligent illiterate of all time. This movie is so wasteful of talent, it is truly disgusting. The script is unbelievable. The dialog is unbelievable. Jane Fonda's character is a caricature of herself, and not a funny one. The movie moves at a snail's pace, is photographed in an ill-advised manner, and is insufferably preachy. It also plugs in every cliche in the book. Swoozie Kurtz is excellent in a supporting role, but so what?<br /><br />Equally annoying is this new IMDB rule of requiring ten lines for every review. When a movie is this worthless, it doesn't require ten lines of text to let other readers know that it is a waste of time and tape. Avoid this movie.",
    "Story of a man who has unnatural feelings for a pig. Starts out with a opening scene that is a terrific example of absurd comedy. A formal orchestra audience is turned into an insane, violent mob by the crazy chantings of it's singers. Unfortunately it stays absurd the WHOLE time with no general narrative eventually making it just too off putting. Even those from the era should be turned off. The cryptic dialogue would make Shakespeare seem easy to a third grader. On a technical level it's better than you might think with some good cinematography by future great Vilmos Zsigmond. Future stars Sally Kirkland and Frederic Forrest can be seen briefly.",
    "Ah, Bait. How do I hate thee? Let me count the ways. 1. You try to be funny, but are corny and unenjoyable; every joke is predictable and expected, and when it comes, does not inspire laughter. Instead, I want to hurl. 2. You try to be dramatic, but are unbelievable; the woman overacts to a terrible degree, and the \"bad guy\" looks like Bill Gates, and is about as scary as...well, Bill Gates. (Just try to imagine Bill Gates trying to intimidate somebody with a gun. Doesn't work, does it? A lawyer, maybe, but not a gun. Doesn't fit.) As for Jamie Foxx, well, just watching him try to deliver a dramatic and heartfelt dialogue is ludicrous, and makes me want to hurl. 3. You try to be action-packed, but instead are dull and dragging too many times. And when the action heats up, the tripod for the camera must have been lost, for the scenes wobble more than those in The Blair Witch Project, and I find myself nauseated, and once again I want to hurl. 4. You try to be a good movie, but you failed, you FAILED, YOU FAILED! I would rather walk barefoot across the Sahara with a pack full of beef jerky and no water, no sunscreen, and only Meryl Streep for company. This hell would be lovelier than a single minute more spent watching everyone in Bait overact their way through an idiotically written story with Bill Gates for a bad guy, and let's not even talk about the massive bomb that goes off in a car that Jamie Foxx's character has just driven OFF A CLIFF, but somehow manages to escape...just kill me now, or do the right thing and promise me that somehow I'll never have to watch a movie that is this bad, ever again.",
    "The premise of the movie has been explained and if you've gotten this far you don't me to pretend that I'm a movie critic. With that being said my own opinion of the movie is quite low. I'm a fan of Takashi Miike but this goes down in the category of his not so great work along with DOA 2 and 3, and some others (many).<br /><br />The movie seems to get a free pass because it is a Takashi film and nothing Takashi does can be wrong. This is a highschoolers approach to cinema. For the rest of us we'll find and hour and a half of a kid screaming for no real reason completely annoying (and yes, this does take away from the film), the pace of the film almost reaching levels of rigomortis, and the acting...well...hmmm. <br /><br />If one is a Takashi fan you'll see it regardless to peak your interests. It lacks any originality (see the Neverending Story) or any character development from the lead character in the face of conflict other then a quite superficial one. <br /><br />As it has been pointed out this is the first film Miike has been credited with co-writing, but that doesn't mean much as non of what we'd hope would be Miike's personality would spill over into the screen. All we get are some of the token Miike shots vis the director of photography.<br /><br />The movie had the potential to be something great. The premise is not a difficult one to run wild with. But this one seemed to have been run into the ground.<br /><br />My suggestion is if you're just getting into Miike is go with some of the standards like Gozu, Ichi, and Audition. Then movie into his works like Blue's Harp, Fudoh, Rainy Dog, Bird People of China.",
    "Uninspired direction leaves a decent cast stranded in a handsome but bland adaptation, in which dialogue seems recited rather than heartfelt, and cash strapped appearances by the ghosts fail to round up any sense of awe or magic; Edward Woodward, as the Ghost of Christmas Present, wobbles around on stilts and seems to be doing an impression of Bernard Cribbins. As Scrooge, George C. Scott is too wry, and he never seems to truly believe in it, which robs his performance of its effect. The scenes in which he's shown his past have as much impact as if he was half-heartedly flicking through his family album. No one else seems to be putting any effort in, except Frank Finlay, who chronically overacts.",
    "I was sooooo excited to see this movie after finally reading the book this week. My 13 year old son was looking forward to it too. I rented it and snuggled down to enjoy a classic holiday story brought to life on screen.<br /><br />Boy, was I disappointed. This movie veered off from the book more times than is forgivable. George C. Scott is an excellent actor but in this, it seemed that he was fully into character only about 20% of the time. The rest of the time he was quite flat.<br /><br />I realize that this was made in '84, pre-CG effects, for the most part. But it looked to be very B-movie quality, especially the encounter with Jacob Marley.<br /><br />The biggest disappointment was the fact that they left out one of the most moving parts of the story: When the Spirit of Christmas Present takes Scrooge on the whirlwind tour of the world, observing people in the bleakest of circumstances still having the light and love of Christmastime.<br /><br />I will admit that Mr. Scott did a good job with the \"reformed\" Scrooge at the end. That was a refreshing portrayal.<br /><br />I wish that Bob Cratchit had been portrayed as a little more ragged and down-trodden. And Tiny Tim... oh don't even get me started on bad child actors...",
    "Having seen three other versions of the same film, I am afraid for me this is by far the weakest, primarily due to Scott's rather dull and leaden performance. His emotions throughout are so bland it makes it difficult to engage in the film. Alistair Sim portrayed the role infinitely better. When Scrooge was at his meanest, you don't get the sense Scott is saying the dialogue with much conviction and when he undergoes his metamorphosis he is similarly unconvincing. I cannot think of any actors in this film who match those from the Alistair Sim version. Even the musical version (and frankly the Muppets) take on this are better executed. Very disappointing.",
    "Saw this movie in my English class this afternoon and was surprised by how bad this version was. Don't get me wrong, George C. Scott was terrific as Scrooge, but the rest of the cast fails so very badly. Sometimes I couldn't stop laughing at the stupid acting and the repeated line: \"Merry Christmas to everyone!\" Other times I almost fell asleep.<br /><br />The movie is based on a Charles Dickens short story about a rich guy, who don't think Christmas is nothing but humbug. After 30 minutes, the rich guy is visited by three ghosts, who persuade him to celebrate Christmas after all.<br /><br />I can not understand how this movie, with a script so bad it must have been written in five minutes, can be so well-rated. Instead of this piece of garbage, I recommend to you, the Bill Murray comedy Scrooged. That at least, was funny...",
    "When will the hurting stop? I never want to see another version of a Christmas Carol again. They keep on making movies with the same story, falling over each other in trying to make the movie better then the rest, but sadly fail to do so, as this is not a good story. Moralistic, old-fashioned, conservative happy-thinking. As if people learn. The numerous different versions of this film prove that we don´t.",
    "It was 9:30 PM last night at my friend's camping trailer and we were so hyped to watch South Park (a new episode). The thing is, in my country, South Park airs at 10:30 PM and we decided to kill time by watching the show now airing, Father of the Pride. I'll start by saying that I have only watched to episodes. The first time I watched it, I found it unfunny and crude for nothing, so I thought ''Holy sh*t, I have a football game early tomorrow, so I have to stop watching stupid cartoons''. But yesterday, I tried to give Father of the Pride a second chance. I find that it's a complete rip-off of The Simpsons, only replacing yellow human characters by lions instead.<br /><br />The second thing is I wonder why it got it's TV-14 rating. I find The Simpsons a lot more vulgar, and the only real vulgarity in this show is a few homosexual (unfunny) jokes. The Simpsons is also a lot more violent (Halloween specials) and crude. I also heard that the creator of the series has also directed Shrek 2, well I've got news for him: Shrek 2 was way better and I think he stayed too much in the family thematic. However, I must admit that Father of the Pride did make me smile (even burst out laughing once) three or four times.<br /><br />All in all, I don't mind Father of the Pride. I don't hate it, but I don't like either. I've seen way better from ''The Simpsons''.<br /><br />3.5/10",
    "This is blatantly a futuristic adaptation of Jules Verne's \"Mysterious Island\". The sound editing is pretty bad. You hear the dialogue on set and you hear the voices being recorded on a recording booth at the same time! This is an amateur film with actors from Boston and shot around New Hampshire. For those living in New Engalnd and who is reading this comment will be wowed with a capital W. This film is full of flaws. You get to hear the director's voice giving directions and giving out directions to the actress. \"OK now stand up.\" As for the other characters. There is this guy who talks with his mind instead of his voice and this blue alien. The alien guy talks with a deep voice. When he is yawning or grunting when he is fighting you hear the actor's voice. As for the special effects, man! This was Brett Piper's early work for crying out loud! The creatures are good but the animation is jerky. Really jerky. Sort of like Karl Zeman animation in JOURNEY TO BEGINNING OF TIME (1955). The special effects are imaginative. Thge music is good. Bottom line, this film makes EQUINOX or PLANET OF THE DINOSAURS look like a Ray Harryhausen epic. Did you know MYSTERIOUS PLANET was a home movie and was on a shoes string budget? A must watch for aspiring film makers.",
    "Beyond a shadow of a doubt Mysterious Planet is one of the worst movies ever made, yet retains an affection in my heart because the poverty of its special effects and astoundingly awful sound track in the first 15 minutes (and to be honest that's all you need to see) combine to create something that is hilariously side-splitting.<br /><br />The opening scene in 'space' is just about as unfathomable as cinematography gets, as washing-up liquid bottles whiz past your eyes to muffled dialogue. Before you've had time to work out whether it's you who's gone mad, the credits roll and the action struggles to life.<br /><br />And aside from the double-headed plasticine giant snail that terrorises our heroes, you also get the added double bonus of having both the original actors voices AND the dubbed voices at the same time. Pure genius.<br /><br />The sad thing for fans of this kind of fare is that I've only ever seen one copy, so the chances of ever seeing it yourself is highly unlikely. Perhaps I own the only copy in existence.<br /><br />",
    "The silent one-panel cartoon Henry comes to Fleischer Studios, billed as \"The world's funniest human\" in this dull little cartoon. Betty, long past her prime, thanks to the Production Code, is running a pet shop and leaves Henry in charge for far too long -- five minutes. A bore.",
    "William Russ is the main character throughout this made for TV movie. He left his family behind to only reappear and begin paying off his debts. But he tries to keep away from his family. Thats where Peter Falk (Colombo) comes in, playing several different roles, to convince him to come home.<br /><br />The story is average and they actually managed to get a former star (Peter Falk) and use him to a fairly nice degree. But William Russ wasn't truly a star. However, it appears his acting is still OK.<br /><br />I found the delivery and story very cheesy in how everything was predictable. In fact, the last 20 minutes I could almost dictate word for word before it happened. A good movie should never be like that.<br /><br />Overall, it was a sub-par movie. In a letter grading system, it would receive a \"D\".",
    "From a poorly contrived plot line that makes almost no sense to bad dialogue and disjointed scenes to the ultimate downer, bad acting (even Peter Falk can't find his way) \"Finding John Christmas\" is better left lost. Ms. Bertinelli's performance is without depth or emotion as are her co-stars, William Russ as brother Hank and David Cubitt as love interest Noah. Jennifer Pisana as Soccoro, the daughter of single dad Noah is almost unbearable to watch let alone listen to singing. But who can blame them with material like this. Michael J. Murray's script is juvenile at best. <br /><br />Each year at this time I search the TV guides and wait anxiously for some of the really classic Christmas and inspirational holiday films to appear on the small screen. Films like \"Miracle on 34th Street\", Ernst Lubitsch's delightful \"The shop around the corner\" and, of course the 1951 version of \"Scrooge\". There's Frank Capra's classics \"It's a wonderful life\" and \"Meet John Doe\". Hey, forget the classics. What about \"Home Alone\" or \" Home for the Holidays\" with Holly Hunter and a great performance by Robert Downey Jr.? <br /><br />My present to you is by way of advice. Your time would be better spent searching out these films than finding \"Finding John Christmas\". Merry Christmas!",
    "I never like to comment on a good film but when it comes to a bad movie, I gotta come really hard on it. Talking about Vivah, this guy, Sooraj Badjatya, seems to have completely lost it. After success of Hum Aapke Hain Kaun, he thought he can make money with cheesy wedding videos. Vivah is so so cheesy that Badjatyas have left Johars and Chopras behind.<br /><br />There was not a single moment during the movie where I can say 'Oh! at least this thing is good'. Aloknath does cliché in a role of Girl's father, Shahid kapoor looks fat and Shahrukhed, Amrita rao is another disaster in addition to ugly looking sets, bad costumes, hackneyed storyline, monstrous stepmother, trying-hard-to-act actors, cacophonous background music, cheap soundtracks.<br /><br />Now the spoiler, I'm warning you guys that as happens in all his other movies, after a calamitous incidence movie ends on a happy note.",
    "I won't say this movie was bad, but it wasn't good either. I expected something good but I guess Hum Aapke Hain Kaun was much better than this. This was completely old fashioned. At every stage of this movie, I hoped for some twist and what do I get? The girl gets burned and wins her aunt's love. <br /><br />Despite of being engaged, they have to take permission for every little move they make. They are so darn shy even after so many meetings. I expected the aunt to be much more brutal than that. All she did was crib madly. <br /><br />Hey, we have kids too, but we don't watch them and have tears in our eyes always. This movie is a dream. Happy family, one cruel woman, good in-laws and a man who loves her to death. In HAHK Anupam Kher was the poor bride's father and now it's vice versa. And I somehow knew that Mohnish Behl would be in this movie. Anyway I believe I wasted my time. I give it a 2/10.",

Wake up people!<br /><br />Four out of the five people that saw the film with me would not recommend the film. We had a great time bashing majority of the unrealistic scenes.

I was hugely disappointed. It is a script reading not a film, vulgar for the sake of being vulgar, bankrupt in every way that \"The Tailor of Panama\" is rich and satisfying. Blame it on the screen writing and directing. I sat in the theater waiting for the \"good part;\" it never came. I neither laughed nor cried, although one line of dialog did make me smile. Worth $7?

    "I very nearly walked out, but I'd paid my money, and my nearly-as-disgusted friend wanted to hold out. After the endearing, wide-eyed innocence of \"A New Hope\" and the thrilling sophistication of \"The Empire Strikes Back,\" I remember awaiting \"Return of the Jedi\" with almost aching anticipation. But from the opening scene of this insultingly commercial sewage, I was bitterly disappointed, and enraged at Lucas. He should have been ashamed of himself, but this abomination undeniably proves that he doesn't have subatomic particle of shame in his cold, greedy heart. Episode I would go on to reinforce this fact -- your honor, I call Jarjar Binks (but please issue barf bags to the members of the jury first).<br /><br />From the initial raising of the gate at Jabba's lair, this \"film\" was nothing more than a two-plus-hour commercial for as many licensable, profit-making action figures as Lucas could cram into it -- the pig-like guards, the hokey flesh-pigtailed flunky, that vile muppet-pet of Jabba's, the new and recycled cabaret figures, the monsters, etc., etc., ad vomitum. Then there were the detestably cute and marketable Ewoks. Pile on top of that all of the rebel alliance aliens. Fifteen seconds each on-screen (or less) and the kiddies just GOTTA have one for their collection. The blatant, exploitative financial baiting of children is nauseating.<br /><br />Lucas didn't even bother to come up with a new plot -- he just exhumed the Death Star from \"A New Hope\" and heaved in a boatload of cheap sentiment. What an appalling slap in the face to his fans. I can't shake the notion that Lucas took a perverse pleasure in inflicting this dreck on his fans: \"I've got these lemmings hooked so bad that I can crank out the worst piece of stinking, putrid garbage that I could dream up, and they'll flock to the theaters to scarf it up. Plus, all the kiddies will whine and torture their parents until they buy the brats a complete collection of action figures of every single incidental undeveloped, cartoonish caricature that I stuffed in, and I get a cut from every single one. It'll make me even more obscenely rich.\"<br /><br />There may have been a paltry, partial handful of redeeming moments in this miserable rip-off. I seem to recall that Harrison Ford managed to just barely keep his nose above the surface of this cesspool. But whatever tiny few bright spots there may be are massively obliterated by the offensive commercialism that Lucas so avariciously embraced in this total, absolute sell-out to profit.",
    "The fine cast cannot uplift this routine tale of a secretary murdered by her married paramour. In fact there are more questions than answers in this one-sided tale of romance and murder; and since we are only provided with the prosecution's side, none of these questions will be answered. This is the type of fare that appeals to the \"He Woman, Man Hater\" clubs of America. As presented, it is the tale of an innocent woman who just happens to be \"caught up\" in a romance with a married, high-profile attorney. Is it possible that IF, she had not been two timing her boy friend and having an affair with a married man, the whole nasty murderous, sordid incident could have been avoided? When you watch this, don't worry about going to the 'fridge, you won't miss anything.",
    "This film was choppy, incoherent and contrived. It was also an extremely mean-spirited portrayal of women. I rented it because it was listed as a comedy (that's a stretch), and because the cover said Andie McDowell was acting up a storm in it. She wasn't. I'm a gal, I watched this film with two guys, and we spent an hour afterwards exclaiming over how bad it was.<br /><br />WARNING: PLOT SUMMARY BELOW! RAMPANT SPOILERS!<br /><br />The movie starts out with a fairly hackneyed plot about an older woman who takes up with a younger man, to the severe disapproval of her two jealous single girlfriends. They want her to marry a boring guy their own age who is kind of in love with her. But she's so happy with her oversexed puppy that you're rooting for them to stick it out, and sure enough, she decides to marry the guy. But her harpy girlfriend, aided by the wishy-washy one, sets up a plot to trick our heroine into thinking the guy is cheating on her. It works. She has a fight with him, he runs out of the house and is crushed by a truck (Remember the movie's title?) So now he's dead, two-thirds of the way through the film. And although our heroine is a school headmistress who spends her time watching over girls, she apparently forgot to use birth control and is pregnant.<br /><br />She's already broken off relations with her girlfriends, because they were so unsupportive. Alone and pitiful, she decides to marry the boring guy. Did I mention that the boring guy who kind of loves her is a minister? She had asked him to marry her to the young guy (nice, huh?), but now she tells him she'll marry him, and apparently he has no objections to being dicked around in this fashion. But her girlfriends rescue her at the altar and take her home, where they not-quite-confess that they were mostly responsible for the love of her life getting smushed. She has the kid. In the final scene, they leave it in a crib inside her house while they go out on the porch to drink, smoke and be smug. I kid you not, it's that bad. I left out the part about the cancer red-herring and the harpy's ridiculous lesbian moment.",
    "This film is a calculated attempt to cash in the success of Sex in the City and Four Weddings and a Funeral. In fact, if they'd called it Sex at a Funeral, they might have done better at the box office.<br /><br />But the film falls between two stools and can't get up. The characters spout improbably bright dialog, but never act in any way remotely recognizable as human. One arbitrary, senseless action follows another to advance what passes for a plot, and one soon tires of the falsity of the whole enterprise.<br /><br />Andie MacDowell gets points for acting her little heart out, but the performing honors are stolen by Imelda Staunton, as of all things, a police detective (don't they have a height requirement over there?). Ms. Staunton seems unable to make a false move. Would that we could say the same about the writer-director.<br /><br />If Notting Hill annoyed you as being bogus, stay away from this one. Phonus bolognus on the half-shell.",
    "This had to be one of the worst films ever. When Kate shows up and Jed is with a bunch of guys and they all start clapping...so Hollywood. Another bad scene was when Kate was running her hands over the pavement it appeared that she was examining the texture of the pavement. Andie's acting is so bad in this film - I could not connect with them or feel there love for each other. The other 2 women however were very good and overshadowed Andie. Anyway this was such a campy movie. I usually like these type of films but I just couldn't get into this film. Too many unlikely situations and again Andie's acting didn't help the film. Also, she is all gums. Lancome must put her makeup on with a putty knife because she looks glamorous in the commericals.",
    "This starts off bad, what with the three women acting like simpering junior high school wussies sitting around giggling with their gin, endless cigarettes and a caramel chocolate treat for the one who tells the best 'man' story, and then it gets worse -=- spoiler alert =-= what with Andie's character falling for the young organ player who used to be her student when he was 14 (she's the headmistress of an English school, believe it or not), only to have him destroyed thanks to her bitch-from-hell 'girlfriend' . ..and then from there, it's basically unwatchable claptrap: she forgives her 'friend' and has the organ player's love child and the 3 women end up as they started, drinking more gin and smoking more cigarettes blah blah blah. Andie's character throws the caramel chocolates out in the street, in a pathetic attempt to symbolize growth. Have mercy.",
    "This was awful. Andie Macdowell is a terrible actress. So wooden she makes a rocking horse look like it could do a better job. But then remember that turn in Four Weddings, equally as excruciating. Another film that portrays England as full of Chocolate box cottages, and village greens. I mean that school, how many schools apart from maybe Hogwarts look like that? The twee police station looked like the set from Heartbeat ( a nauseating British series set in the 60s).This film just couldn't make its mind up what it wanted to be- a comedy or a serious examination of the undercurrents in women's friendships. If it had stuck to the former then the graveyard sex scenes and the highly stupid storming of the wedding might just have worked( i say just). But those scenes just didn't work with the tragedy in the second half. I also find it implausible that Kate would ever speak to Molly again after her terrible behaviour. A final note- what is a decent actress like Staunton doing in this pile of poo? Not to mention Anna Chancellor. Macdowell should stick to advertising wrinkle cream.",
    "Caught this on IFC yesterday, and can't believe the positive reviews! Am I the only one who thought these \"ladies\" were anything but? Kate tells Jed she could get fired because she's supposed to be a pillar of the community, but puts out for him! Then they suddenly decide they're in love? And she's SO devastated over his death, she doesn't go to his funeral, much less, tell his family the \"good news\"! By the way, how did an American get to be the headmistress of a very proper British school? Janine should have been kicked off the force for her inexcusable abuse of power, but nothing happens! And she winds up boffing a con she brought in for questioning! And the less said about Molly, the better!<br /><br />As for the guilt Janine and Molly feel over Jed, please! It's the punk's own damn fault he got turned into roadkill! Where's the guilt over poor Gerald, who gets puked on? If only I could do the same to the bozos behind this \"movie\"!",
    "I thought it was a New-York located movie: wrong! It's a little British countryside setting.<br /><br />I thought it was a comedy: wrong! It's a drama.... Well, up to the last third, because after the story becomes totally \"abracadabrantesque\", the symbolic word for a French presidential mandate. It means, close to nonsense even it the motives would like to bring a sincere feeling.<br /><br />What Do I have left? Maybe, a good duo of actress: Yes, I know, they are 3 friends, but the redhead policewoman is a bit invisible for me. The tall doctoress surprises by her punch, and McDowell delivers a fine acting as usual, all in delicate, soft and almost mute attitude. This gentleness puzzles me, because as other fine artists or directors, the same pattern is repeating over and over. In her case, it's like, whatever the movie, it's always the same character defined by her feelings, her values, who lives infinite different stories. I still don't know how to set the limit (or the fusion) between the artists and the works.<br /><br />Another positive side of this movie is its feminine touch & the interesting different points of view. The women have each their own way of living, even if they are all single. It brings a lot of tolerance and learning to witness how a same and unique reality can be perceived in as many ways as people.<br /><br />Finally, the movie is quite viewable, but the great final cuts the desire of a next vision.",
    "Was this meant to be a comedy or a serious drama? This film starts with a light-hearted banter between three women. Fine. It moves into a conflict between the women when one of them meets a man. Fine. There are a few antics between them. Fine. But when the plot thickens and finally becomes black I started to wonder whether I had misinterpreted the first part of the movie. It continues in this vein for a while until, in the end, it tries to go back to the original light-hearted banter. But by now it's too late. It's hard to see why these women would still be talking to one another and the finale is unconvincing. Truly a lesson (for British filmmakers anyway) of how not to make films. Difficult to see how the producers ever convinced themselves this film would work. And the box office proved it to be a real flop, because I'd never heard of this film until this weekend (four years after its release).",

Far fetched no longer covers it. Without these unbelievable scenes, there may have been hope for a sweet love story. Instead, all the viewer is left with is an involuntary shaking of head -- these things just don't happen! Without giving away cliff-hanger details, I warn the viewer of having high expectations for this film; most (like me) will be very disappointed. On a scale of 1 to 10, this one ranks a weak 4 with me. There is much better material out there. This one isn't worth your time.",

    "The worst thing about Crush is not that it's acted pretty bad, or that the plot is virtually non-existent, and it's not even that bad that the camerawork could have been better.<br /><br />No, the worst part of this movie is that it has a few absolutely brilliant moments that keep you hoping that there are more to come.<br /><br />But in the end, it's too little, too late. If you are a fan of violin-music and cheap tearjerking scenes of 40+ women crying and hugging and talking about babies and marriage - then by all means, don't miss it.<br /><br />I myself am not exactly thrilled to see the things listed above in a movie, and as a result I had a pretty horrible time. The few absolutely brilliant jokes can not make up for the rest of it.<br /><br />The verdict: 4/10. Guilty of wasting my time.<br /><br />",
    "Not a `woman film' but film for the gang. One of the worst films ever made by a male director about woman. Director Andy McKay simply doesn't know woman.

I wonder how three good actresses accepted to take part in it.",
    "As a single woman over 40, I found this film extremely insulting and demeaning to single women over 40, not to mention every other woman, of any age. It was a sad, pathetic attempt by a man to write and direct a \"chick flick\", and it failed miserably. Andy McDowell isn't much of an actress to begin with, but given the non-existent \"plot\" (I hate to even refer to it as a plot) in this, she didn't have a chance. There was no character development, no reason to feel sympathy/empathy for any of the characters, and no attempt to make the film in any way realistic or believable. And then there's the obligatory male-fantasy of an attractive straight woman suddenly deciding to give lesbianism a try -- PLEASE.<br /><br />Not only do I wish I could get my money back for the DVD rental, I also want those 112 minutes of my life back. What a ripoff.",
    "I was gifted with this movie as it had such a great premise, the friendship of three women bespoiled by one falling in love with a younger man.<br /><br />Intriguing.<br /><br />NOT! I hasten to add. These women are all drawn in extreme caricature, not very supportive of one another and conspiring and contriving to bring each other down.<br /><br />Anna Chancellor and Imelda Staunton could do no wrong in my book prior to seeing this, but here they are handed a dismal script and told to balance the action between slapstick and screwball, which doesn't work too well when the women are all well known professionals in a very small town.<br /><br />And for intelligent women they spend a whole pile of time bemoaning the lack of men/sex/lust in their lives. I felt much more could have been made of it given a decent script and more tension, the lesbian sub-plot went nowhere and those smoking/drinking women (all 3 in their forties???) were very unrealistic - even in the baby scene - screw the baby, gimme a cigarette! Right.<br /><br />Like I said, a shame of a waste. 4 out of 10.",
    "\"The Crush\" is a pleasant enough 40-something friends romantic chick flick for the first two-thirds or so, as it tries to be a Brit \"Sex and the City\". <br /><br />I particularly enjoyed the turn-around of the trophy young hunk whose character is not much fleshed out (come to think of it we didn't see all that much physical flesh of him either and Kenny Doughty is worth seeing more of). <br /><br />They sure make a lot more deal of young man/older woman than was made of the opposite in either version of \"Sabrina\" (neither movie do I like) or for that matter with the Douglas/Zeta-Jones or Dion/Svengali nuptials.<br /><br />Surrounding Andie MacDowell as an ex pat otherwise are welcome familiars from Brit dramas and comedies, such as tart-tongued Anna Chancellor. <br /><br />The plot twists towards the end feel very deus ex machina. But it wasn't until the credits came up at the end that I realized what might really be wrong. Just as with \"Sex and the City,\" the writer/director is male, here first-timer Scot John McKay, and I think he really wanted to do a script about three gay men, probably about them coming out in relation to their lovers and at work (the characters are a school principal, a cop and a doctor), which would have been a better and more interesting movie. The working title for the film was \"The Sad F*cker's Club\" which would have made its parallels with the gay \"Broken Hearts Club\" even more obvious.<br /><br />(originally written 4/6/2002)",
    "it MIGHT have been a good movie if it had explored something more interesting rather than just the surface of a lesbian relationship if this was the meaning of the movie...it is quite predictable not mentioning that the two girls resemble the Russian group t.A.T.u....coincidence? i don't think so. There is nothing original in this movie to support it so they had to use something which is already famous.You know the recipe. The other actors...well,i just don't know what their role is supposed to be. Most of them are well - known people in Romania and i must mention some of them are not even actors(e.g.Mihaela Radulescu).SO to summarize it: \"girl band tatty\"+desperate/publicity needing \"actors\"+ a non-existing plot+ the occasion to use bad language in order to shock= Love sick....too bad...the idea was good,though...and i am seriously holding myself from commenting the title...",
    "***LIGHT SPOILER ALERT*** The story sounds good and if you've read the novel, then you're probably expecting a deep and intense movie that could offer some insight for some interesting and insufficiently explored human relationships.<br /><br />True enough, the script tries to do that, the director tries to do that, but the main cast fails miserably. Maria's acting is so dry that lacks any feeling whatsoever, her most intense moments seem almost comical. Sometimes she seems to be nervous due to the camera. Her only really feeling scene is near the end where she gets dumped by her girlfriend.<br /><br />Ioana seems even more tense than Maria and even worse, she doesn't seem natural at all. Maria had the attitude, even if it was artificially pushed towards being obvious, but she had it and her character received some credibility. And to make matters worse, we don't have an insight on her: where does she come from, how come she got involved in the lesbian relationship, how did the relationship evolve? We only get some bits from her parents and their relationship just seems to 'be' there: it has a content and and end, but no beginning. Just like her partner Maria, she has only once scene that is truly touching, the scene where she dumps Maria's character Kiki.<br /><br />Tudor is the only person in this movie (aside from the landlady, great acting there) who manages to prove some acting talent. He has his character's attitude and it fits him. Only once or twice he seems to falter (the scene at his parents' meal, he tries to be obvious when it wasn't necessary at all).<br /><br />I love the story, Tudor Chirila is OK there, the landlady actually acts and Puya delivers his couple of lines with style, but this doesn't save the movie. Too bad, the entire setting had huge potential and the Romanian cinematography could've used a movie on this theme.<br /><br />Oddly enough, the incestuous relationship between brother and sister seems to have more credibility than the no-background no-feeling (well, Maria's spoken interludes are a nice try in this direction) lesbian relationship of Maria and Ioana. I'm quite sorry for spending money on a ticket, I'd rather had watched it from the comfort of my room.",
    "This is a movie that relies solely on the somewhat controversial image of incest and lesbianism to get noticed.That is it.The dialogs are pathetic and the sensuality of the \"sex scenes\" is absolutely absent.The acting and the dialog are more suited for high-school children,yet the subject is intended for adult audiences. It is a gutless and shallow movie.It could have been way better if it had a story and more drama. Ah and on top of that, one more thing: why are inner monologues so excessively used? Makes it seem so cheap.All in all an embarrassing movie for Romanian cinema as well as for mature audiences attempting to view it.I know the means are scarce but, that is not always an excuse for a movie flopping as this one does.And please start using some good actors in your movies and stop recycling them from musicians (Tudor Chirila) - they can't act!",

    "Considering that this movie had a serious and quite successful launching campaign, I would have expected something to be worth the fuzz...from the opening scene on (in which the two brothers \"sensually\" caress each other, laying naked in a bed) it goes rapidly downwards...nothing to get the attention, not a mind-catching thing in the whole plot, baaad baad acting (a few minor exceptions, but artificiality is at its best). Incest and lesbianism are promising themes, but the script analyses none of the two in depth ( mind that a possible excuse of the makers, saying that they aimed for a subtle movie would be hilarious, unless subtle and superficial mean the same thing...). The too curious viewers will not get any interesting scene...at this point, that could have saved some of the movie...so you can imagine how bad it is. Many other things could be said...but please watch the movie yourselves...I am an egoist and I would like as many people as possible to waste about 1 1/2h of their lives...like I did :(",
    "Yes, indeed, it could have been a good movie. A love biangle, (sorry for the poetical license, but is not a triangle!) an interesting story, unfortunately badly told. The image is sometimes weird, sometimes OK, the picture looks crowded and narrow-sighted. The sound needs more attention (it usually does in Romanian movies), the light and color filters are sometimes badly chosen. The soundtrack is short and is not helping the action. About the acting... sorry but the best actress is the landlady. The others are acting immaturely and cannot convince the viewer. The acting is poetical when it should be realistic, and realistic when it should be poetical. It's a picture for adults, told by the children. Bother only if extremely curious.",
    "Closer to reality and containing more depth than \"Breakdance\", Stan Lathan's \"Beat Street\" is still a pretty dull show. Again this pic is really only cashing in on the 'breakin' craze but at least we get a little bit of entertainment from the plot, which concerns the lives of three young friends and a younger brother, all growing up in Queens, New York. Each has their own unique talent. One is a hustler, one a d.j., another an artist who creates 'burners', while little bro' Lee is a hot 'hip hop' dancer.<br /><br />Lathan is unable to generate any real audience interest in the story though, and his young cast are likewise struggling with their characters. Therefore it is left almost entirely to the funky music and the 'fresh' dancing to save the day.<br /><br />Choreography is again sharp for both club and street scenes, but this alone is not enough to lift \"\"Beat Street\" to greater heights. Unfortunately the film really falls flat late on, after showing a glimmer of hope that it just might get interesting.<br /><br />Sunday, August 25, 1996 - Video",
    "Hilariously obvious \"drama\" about a bunch of high school (I think) kids who enjoy non-stop hip-hop, break dancing, graffiti and trying to become a dj at the Roxy--or something. To be totally honest I was so bored I forgot! Even people who love the music agree this movie is terribly acted and--as a drama--failed dismally. We're supposed to find this kids likable and nice. I found them bland and boring. The one that I REALLY hated was Ramon. He does graffiti on subway trains and this is looked upon as great. Excuse me? He's defacing public property that isn't his to begin with. Also these \"great\" kids tap into the city's electricity so they can hold a big dance party at an abandoned building. Uh huh. So we're supposed to find a bunch of law breakers lovable and fun.<br /><br />I could forgive all that if the music was good but I can't stand hip hop. The songs were--at best--mediocre and they were nonstop! They're ALWAYS playing! It got to the point that I was fast-forwarding through the many endless music numbers. (Cut out the music and you haver a 30 minute movie--maybe) There are a few imaginative numbers--the subway dance fight, a truly funny Santa number and the climatic Roxy show. If you love hip hop here's your movie. But it you're looking for good drama mixed in--forget it. Also HOW did this get a PG rating? There's an incredible amount of swearing in this.",
    "Maybe you shouldn't compare, but Wild Style and Style Wars are original Hip Hop. Beat Street does have a lot of the original artists of early Hip Hop, but they've been obviously made clear that this could be their big break, of course for some it was and that's nice. But if you view this as original Hip Hop Culture you're wrong. It's overproduced and has a Hollywood sauce. Rather look for the first two movies i mentioned. They have convey the grittiness that comes with life in the ghetto. Yes, the rating for this movie is low, but the reviews are mostly positive or even raving. This is probably because although the story, the acting, the dialogues and the direction all are dreadful, the music and dancing is what the people love about it. Me, i do love the dancing but at the time thought that electro was the death of Hip Hop (i was so glad when round '86 a new generation of now classic Hip Hop artists appeared, like Krs One, Public Enemy, Ultramagnetic Mc's, Jungle Brothers, Bizmarkie to name a few), and i still don't like most of the beats in this movie and that is why it doesn't work for me. I mean, Wild Style has not much of a story but the music there is great and authentic. Of course tastes differ and that's alright. But as far as i'm concerned, this movie is trash except for the break dancing and some of the music and so i can't rate it higher than a 4 out of ten.",
    "I could never stand watching Happy Days after Chachi joined the cast, so I knew I was in trouble when the best scene in this movie featured Scott Baio (a skateboard chase scene!). Jodie Foster in her first \"grown-up\" role turns in her usual professional performance but that is no excuse for this boring mess. Two hours out of my life that I'll never get back! No noteworthy characters, unbelievable storyline, questionable editing and horrendous cinematography but worst of all, I couldn't have cared less. The story of California teens in the 1970's, where the kids live miserable lives and all their parents are idiots. Don't waste your time watching this ugly excuse for a movie.",
    "Horrible film with bits of the Ramones strewn about. Your worse than average 1970's/80's comedy format of the cool kids taking over the school with some whimsical plan. This movie is terrible. The plot consists of a girl who enjoys the Ramones and a school bent on fighting against their oppressive administration. Forget this movie and watch something like Wild Zero starring Guitar Wolf if you want an entertaining B movie. Terrible acting, terrible writing, terrible plot with the stamp of approval of the Ramones who probably needed some money quick so they said yes to this movie. That is the only logical thing I can think of because this movie blows.",
    "This movie is a 90 minute Ramones concert with brief periods of stupidity and absolute boredom. What kind of high school is this anyway?<br /><br />Unless you are a major Ramones fan, DO NOT and I repeat DO NOT waste your time like I did. This is utterly unwatchable from start to finish. This movie should be called Ramone Fever. Everyone appears to like them in this movie. There is not a plot to be found in this flick. As far as teen comedies go, you are scraping the bottom of the barrel with this one.",
    "I gave this film 2 stars only because Dominic Monaghan actually put effort through in his acting. Everything else about this film is extremely amateur. Everything associated with the direction of this film was very poorly executed. Not only should the director rethink what she is doing for a life career but maybe she should watch a few films. As Dominic Monaghan is a very credible actor, placing him in a film of this caliber makes him look awful. Whomever the \"actor\" was that played Jack's best friend should never have stepped in front of the camera. I didn't expect much from such a small film, but perhaps a little more time and effort should be put into the characters and their surroundings. Don't waste your time or money on this film (like I did) you will be sorely disappointed.",
    "I jumped at the chance to view this movie uncut and uninterrupted, remembering rahs and raves for it. But wherever it seemed about to slip into being truly scary, it backed off and went somewhere else. The dripping water throughout the house, the black rain, the prophetic dreams, taking the wrong turn in raw sewage were dropped before they could work up to a scream.<br /><br />What a disappointment. Chamberlain's nearly expressionless mask of a face offered little but confused disbelief, something I found myself mirroring as the film wore on. What could have been eerie Aboriginal chanting and instruments in the background were instead a cacophony seemingly designed to beat terror into one's head. The ideas that modern people can embody ancient gods, that the Aboriginal peoples believe red-haired white men were the first priests, and many other possibilities are passed along more like a shopping list than a hint at another dimension (the Dream Time).<br /><br />[SPOILER] In the final scene, it wasn't clear to me what the director was trying to tell. Is there a big wave? So what? How big? A tsunami? Yeah, okay. That's devastating but not apocalyptic. Is it the end of the world? From a wave? The last wave? That'd have to be a pretty darn big wave. Why? Was the world that bad a place? It didn't seem so awful in this movie. Actually I didn't think the wave came off, since the shadow left Burton's face that had been cast by the wave. Was it only Burton's apocalypse? Heck, that happens every day to people who lose it. It wasn't of any interest if it was only him.<br /><br />The most frightening scene, and the one that gives the best indication of Weir's potential, was in Charlie's apartment where Burton has gone to confront the old man for scaring Burton's wife. Charlie keeps asking him \"Who are you?\" and it becomes truly disturbing after a while. Unfortunately, the movie never followed suit.",
    "The perfect murder is foiled when a wife(played by Mary Ellen Trainor, once the wife to director Robert Zemeckis, who helmed this episode), who murders her husband with a poker, has the misfortune of receiving a visitor as she is about to move the body outside..an escaped insane madman dressed in a Santa Claus suit(played by a deviously hideous Larry Drake). She fends for her life while trying to find a way of hiding her husband's corpse. She decides to use an ax, once she downs the Santa killer who misses several chances to chop off the woman's head, to frame the killer for her husband's murder. Santa killer locks her in a closet and pursues the woman's daughter as she tries desperate to free herself to save the child.<br /><br />This episode of TALES FROM THE CRYPT just recycles tired material involving the old \"Santa kills\" theme while also adding the oft-used(add nauseum)woman-murders-her-husband-for-a-man-she's-been-cheating-with routine. It's essentially Trainor trying to find a way to avoid being caught with a dead body she kills while also keeping a safe distance from a maniac. There's nothing refreshing or new about this plot which pretty much goes through the motions. Not one of the show's highlights.",
    "That's not the sound of bees, that's the effect induced by watching this extremely long, extremely boring, badly acted movie. How I ever made it through all 3 1/2 hours without falling asleep I'll never know. The plot is simple...3 thoroughly unlikable morons talk about sex for 3 1/2 hours. And you thought Rohmer was deadly. This is even worse, if that's possible. > I must really be a masochist if I could watch this entire movie without turning it off...or killing someone.",
    "Iberia is nice to see on TV. But why see this in silver screen? Lot of dance and music. If you like classical music or modern dance this could be your date movie. But otherwise one and half hour is just too long time. If you like to see skillful dancing in silver screen it's better to see Bollywood movie. They know how to combine breath taking dancing to long movie. Director Carlos Saura knows how to shoot dancing from old experience. And time to time it's look really good. but when the movie is one and hour it should be at least most of time interesting. There are many kind of art not everything is bigger then life and this film is not too big.",
    "That reviewers liked this movie surprises me. The plot is a muddle. The characters are wooden. Michael Bowen spends most of the film spying on the other characters and misjudging all of them. No one has any redeeming quality or point-of-interest. This is not an edgy work. It is not imaginative. It is not ironic. It is no clever. There is nothing straight forward about this tedious work. That is missed theatrical release is not surprise. That the \"This Network\" airs it diminishes that venue. I definitely recommend turning to a rerun of the Garden Smart show on PBS or even a good informational if you encountered this mess on late night television. If you encounter it on daytime television, take a long walk. Even if you walk in smog, you will feel better not having suffered through this shambles. Life is short. This movie is long.",
    "This is a terrible movie, terrible script, bad direction and nonsensical ending. Also, bad performances, except from Clancy Brown who is criminally underused here, and Michael Pollard. Watching this movie was purgatory--you do it to unload enough bad movie karma to actually see a good one further down the line.<br /><br />The movie presents a father and son who look like they couldn't every possibly have been related. The part of the male lead is not well written and seems uncharismatic in this role. You can see the plot points a mile away. The actions of the female lead and that of her brother, the cop, also make no sense. So, a major action on her part at the end of the movie makes no sense script-wise.",
    "Burt Kennedy used to be a very good director, but you'd never know it by this lumbering mess. Not only does this film look cheap, it IS cheap--most of the battle scenes are lifted from the far superior \"The Last Command\" from 1955, and that footage, shot 32 years previously, looks more contemporary than anything in this picture. The few action scenes that were actually shot for this movie are disorganized, confused and incompetent, looking just as shoddy as the rest of the picture. This has the look and feel of a bad student film (and the budget didn't seem to be a whole lot more). It moves like molasses, the acting for the most part is either over-the-top ham or under-the-top comatose--although Raul Julia comes off better than most of the rest of the cast--and it's chock full of annoying historical inaccuracies. On top of that, it's WAY too long. If you're going to make a boring film, do it in an hour or so and get it over with--don't stretch it out over three hours, like this one does. If you want to see a good movie about the Alamo, check out John Wayne's 1960 version, or even the 1955 film from which this movie stole its action scenes. Hard to believe it took six producers to make a movie this lousy. Skip it.",
    "While being a great James Arness western, this film has gone down as the worst Alamo film ever made. The story was terrible, inaccuracy all through it, and just downright untruths to boot! Continuity was cast to the four winds. Anybody catch the cannon sequence? The Mexicans were dumb enough to fire cannons that obviously had mud and ramrods still sticking out of the tubes. Come on! Then there is Brian Keith's ridiculous hat! Costumer must of been away or something. Or just out of their mind!",
    "This movie is flawed on many fronts. Like many before it, it portrays more of the mythology of the Alamo than the history. The production is poor, overall giving the impression of a welfare project for lots of actors who might have otherwise had to work on Hollywood Squares. This to me was the greatest flaw - I know the ages and general personalities of the real Alamo protagonists and the geriatric ensemble of TV actors chosen to portray them never let any hint of believability intrude.<br /><br />As a native Texan, I grew up with the mythology. I later learned more about the history. I can accept a decent production from either perspective (although I prefer more historical accuracy), but this never gave me a chance to enjoy it. Even John Wayne's or Fess Parker's versions had more life than this stolid mess, while being only slightly less accurate.<br /><br />Very disappointing - avoid it.",
    "Slow and riddled with inaccuracy. Over-looking its flaws this is still an interesting account of the famed and heroic siege of the Alamo during the Texas fight for independence from Mexico. James Arness as Jim Bowie. Brian Keith as Davy Crockett. Alec Baldwin as Col. Travis. Raul Julia as General Santa Anna. This made-for-TV project also stars David Ogden Stiers, Kathleen York and Jim Metzler. Very good original music by Peter Bernstein.",
    "This film, The Alamo:Thirteen Days to Glory, is utter rubbish. The acting is awful, it is far too patriotic and its historical accuracy is not always at its best (Historians would have a field day). It does have a few good moments but not enough to keep interest because it is far too long. Rating * out of **********.",
    "The story by Norman Maclean is a masterwork; Redford's film is a mediocrity. He adds banal scenes of the Maclean brothers going over a falls and of them double-dating in a seedy bar that were not even hinted at in the story. The cipher, Brad Pitt, trying to play the charismatic Paul Maclean, a genius outdoors, proves either risible or depressing, depending on what the original story meant to you. Some of the fly casting scenes are beautiful. Also, Tom Skerritt as the father and Craig Sheffer as Norman are strong and masculine, as men were once expected to be. None of the women make an impression in the film, which is regrettable, because Maclean loved the women in his story and made this clear, even poetic.",
    "The only good part about this film is the beautiful scenery. This movie was long and boring. The minister should have retired from the pulpit the time his son Paul strayed from the teachings he proclaimed. How many times can his boys take the Lord's name in vain in this film being from a Presbyterian background? It doesn't fit. I wished Paul was swept down the river without a boat at the very beginning to spare us the silly, smirkish, selfish story of Paul (Brad Pitt). So Norm becomes a teacher and Paul becomes a compulsive gambler who Norm wants to rescue but doesn't-so what. It's very uninteresting. We see the prejudiced whites being stood up to by Paul because of his native American girl. That was the only part that had some interest and maybe could have been developed into a real 'wild western'. What we only see is a sleepy town where the two minister's sons have nothing to do but 1. Norm chase a lame girlfriend and deal with her family and 2.Paul make up dumb stories at the newspaper shop while scratching his head and take a lot of swigs and tie a lot of flies. I'd rather watch a show about fishing that that film again-which will be never.",
    "... to not live in Montana and especially not to live there at the end of the 19th century.<br /><br />\"A river runs through it\" certainly is a well made movie from a cineastic stand-point. Great landscapes, Redford acting well.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the story is bad (if there is a story at all).<br /><br />I felt sorry for the narrator / author, who is as dry, narrow-minded a character as his father, a preacher. Being driven, not driving his own life, he is left to watch his brother, who is also caged in the small town environment, losing his life. The author never even comes close to undestand his brother's motivations, but at least realizes, that he is lacking the slightest amount of homour / fun. All there is, is fly-fishing, where he follows even as an old man the style of his father.<br /><br />The end is not surprising, it is forseeable from the very beginning.<br /><br />Definitely NOT a must-see (3 / 10)<br /><br />",
    "I always felt that a good film should have a plot. This particular film was missing one, and I feel that it would have been more effective with a plot. This was made even worse by the fact that it seemed to go on forever; I was anxious for it to finally end. However, I just noticed that it was only 123 minutes long; it felt like four hours. Not only was there no plot but the film also lacked a notable conflict. It's not the worst movie I've seen, but I used to say that it was until I saw \"The Fast And The Furious\". So, don't think this review of mine is from someone who needs nothing but action. I actually hate most action films out today; it's just that this film is all the way on the other side of the spectrum. Not much really happens in this movie. However, the scenery and costumes were nice.",

    "Mann photographs the Alberta Rocky Mountains in a superb fashion, and Jimmy Stewart and Walter Brennan give enjoyable performances as they always seem to do. <br /><br />But come on Hollywood - a Mountie telling the people of Dawson City, Yukon to elect themselves a marshal (yes a marshal!) and to enforce the law themselves, then gunfighters battling it out on the streets for control of the town? <br /><br />Nothing even remotely resembling that happened on the Canadian side of the border during the Klondike gold rush. Mr. Mann and company appear to have mistaken Dawson City for Deadwood, the Canadian North for the American Wild West.<br /><br />Canadian viewers be prepared for a Reefer Madness type of enjoyable howl with this ludicrous plot, or, to shake your head in disgust.",
    "This is an action Western. James Steart leads an all star cast in the scenic Northwest, which is filmed in great splendor. The scenery and costumes are great. There is action and adventure. Stewart plays a wealthy cattleman who runs afoul of a crooked government in the old Nothwest.<br /><br />The main drawback is the stereotypical cynic that Hollywood has always made into a hero. Even when this movie was made, the cynic was the stereotypical hero, and the one Stewart portrays really has few saving graces. He is kind to his two partners, and that does give him an extra dimension of credibility and likability.<br /><br />However, he is so piggish to everyone else, it is hard to really care for him, or to accept him. He is much like the one dimensional spaghetti Western characters (cut not that bad).<br /><br />Still, the minor characters are quite enjoyable. Walter Brennan, Royal Dano, Harry Morgan, and others make this worth watching.",
    "This is the worst sequel on the face of the world of movies. Once again it doesn't make since. The killer still kills for fun. But this time he is killing people that are making a movie about what happened in the first movie. Which means that it is the stupidest movie ever.<br /><br />Don't watch this. If you value the one precious hour during this movie then don't watch it. You'll want to ask the director and the person beside you what made him make it. Because it just doesn't combine the original makes of horror, action, and crime.<br /><br />Don't let your children watch this. Teenager, young child or young adult, this movie has that sorta impact upon people.",
    "Ah, Channel 5 of local Mexican t.v. Everyday, at 2:00 a.m. they air Horror movies from the 70's to early 2000's. It was \"Return To Cabin By The Lake\" the movie that aired yesterday. I regret for watching it.<br /><br />The original \"Cabin By The Lake\" was a regularly popular low budgeter and it was good accepted. The problem is that this sequel is horrible, not even unintentionally funny and tries to imitate the original. Ugh. The plot is really stupid in all the sense of the word.<br /><br />The movie at some points looks like a soap-opera because of it's absurd dialogs, cinematography, and direction.<br /><br />My advice is : avoid this one at all costs. It's a movie that it shouldn't be watched by anyone. Not even for lovers of mediocre film-making.<br /><br />You have been warned.",
    "Preposterous sequel stretches credibility to a great degree as diabolical sociopath Stanley Kaldwell returns this time infiltrating the movie production of the novel he wrote for the garden drownings, assuming the identity of a second unit director he murdered.<br /><br />Film pokes gleeful fun at Hollywood, with a tongue-in-cheek script taking shots at tyrannical directors who sleep with their actresses(..looking for a way up the ladder)and dislike anyone challenging them for complete spotlight. Brian Krause, who I thought was dreadful, overacting to the point where the satire felt incredibly forced, portrays the loud, temperamental director who doesn't like the fact that his second unit director and screenplay writer, Alison(..played by Dahlia Salem)seem to be taking over the production. Andrew Moxham is Paul Parsons, who is the brother of a victim from the first film. The film's dark humor this time takes the idea of a serial killer actually operating as director of a movie set and exploits it for all it's worth. Nelson again ably slides back into his psycho role without any difficulty, with Stanley as clever as ever, using his brains to commandeer a film production, killing whoever he has to in order to maintain full control of his work, letting no one stand in his way..that is until Alison realizes who Stanley really is. Alison is the type of ambitious writer who wants to capture the essence of her subject..what motivated Stanley to kill, why would he do such a thing, and what led such a man down this dark path? The humor of Alison actually working with that very man is also part of the satire at the heart of this dark comedy thriller. Of course, you get the inevitable showdown between Alison and Stanley, with a really ridiculous, unbelievable conclusion regarding the killer's fate(..quite a hard pill to swallow). Unlike the first film, which was photographed with sophisticated polish, director Po-Chih Leong uses unnecessary techniques which are not needed(..such as shooting an all kinds of weird angles, slow-motion in a sepia color, and several instances which are captured on video)and rather annoy instead of impress. This sequel, to me, just wasn't on target as much as the original, with a lot of the humor less effective and more obvious.",
    "Return to Cabin by the Lake just.... was lacking. It must have had a very low budget because a fair amount of the movie must have been filmed with a regular video camera. So, within the same scene - you'll have some movie-quality camera shots AND simple video camera shots. It makes for a very odd blend! I think they should have found SOME way to not do the \"home video\" type effect! <br /><br />I think it's worthwhile to see it IF you have seen the original CBTL because then you can compare and see the differences. But if you haven't seen the original CBTL.... you'll never want to see it if you see this one first! It will probably seem way too cheesy and turn you off from even caring about the original one.",
    "This movie was made-for-TV, so taking that into account, I'm not going to rip into it as hard as I would a feature film. The script is sub-par, but it does succeed in being mildly humorous in spots, whether it means to be or not. The acting is mostly over-the-top, but that is true for many lower-budget movies.<br /><br />The aspect of this movie that I really hated, though, was that 90-95% of it is shot on film, but in random places, there will be 5-10 seconds where the footage is shot on video. You can tell because there is less contrast, the colors are less vivid, and the footage is clearly 30 frames per second instead of film's 24 frames per second. I'm not sure if maybe these scenes had to be shot later and at that time they didn't have the money to shoot on film (I assume this is why, anyway), but it is disorienting and really makes the film look shoddier than it had to look.<br /><br />Anyway, I've definitely seen worse movies, but I definitely wouldn't say that I enjoyed this movie and I can't recommend that anyone see it.",
    "IF you are planning to see this movie, please reconsider. I don't usually post my comments about something I've seen on television, but this one was such a waste of my life that I needed to do something productive to get that bad taste out of my mouth. Critiquing this movie would take far too long as there are so many things wrong with it. I will just simply say, please do not ever see this movie. It was a complete waste of my time and it WILL be a waste of yours. Anyone that wrote a positive review of this movie is one of two things; utterly inept, or working for the company that produced it. Again, I guarantee that you will indeed regret seeing this movie!",
    "<br /><br />I saw this on the Sci-Fi channel. It came on right after the first one. For some reason this movie kept me interested. I don't know why, stop asking.<br /><br />---SPOILERS--- Okay... It was cheesy how this guy got involved with the making of the movie. In the first movie, he had a \"reason\" to kill people, but in this sequal, half of the killings/attempted killings were basicly for no reason. Stanley killed the director due to creative differences, he captured the co-writer due to creative differences, but what was the deal with trying to kill off the cast? No cast, no movie. He wanted it to \"look real when they died\"? If this was supposed to be such a high budget movie, use the special effects, MAN. Of course like the first one, the captured girl gets away, and Stanley ends up getting messed up, and dissapears. Woooooow (sarcasm). This movie HAD potential. And the saddest thing of all... the really sad part... I would watch a \"Cabin by the Lake 3\". Only because I like Judd Nelson, and he's the only good part about this sequal.",
    "I watched Cabin by the Lake this afternoon on USA. Considering this movie was made for TV is was interesting enough to watch the sequel. So, I tune in for the airing this evening and was extremely disappointed. I knew I wouldn't like the movie, but I was not expecting to be perplexed by the use of DV (digital video). The movie would have been tolerable if it wasn't for these juxtaposed digital shots that seemed to come from nowhere. I expected the plot line to be tied in with these shots, but there seemed to be no logical explanation. (WARNING: THE FOLLOWING MAYBE A SPOILER!!!!) The open ending in Cabin by the Lake was acceptable, but the open ending on the sequel is ridiculous. I can only foresee Return of Return to The Cabin by the Lake being watch able is if the movie was shown up against nothing, but infomercials at 4 o'clock in the morning.",
    "A decent sequel, but does not pack the punch of the original. A murderous screenwriter(Judd Nelson)assumes new identities in order to direct his own novel CABIN BY THE LAKE. Still ruthless killing, but movie seems very tongue-in-cheek. Any humor is not of the funny kind. Total project seems to have the quality of a quickie and at times Nelson is way over the top. This movie is about a script being rewritten before going to the screen...this should have happened to this script.",
    "Return to Cabin by the Lake does not, in any way, stand up to the original. With only one main character (Stanley) returning for the sequal, the film is not even worth the 2 hours of your time. I am a huge fan of the first film, the story line and acting was really good, but this is one movie that I will never again watch. It is basically equal to what the sequals to Urban Legends and Blair Witch were like, but with much worse acting. I've personally seen better acting in soap operas, it is so pitiful that you just have to laugh. I, in no way, recommend this movie to anyone, watching it will just detract from the first.",
    "I thought Hedy Burress (who managed to escape from the watery grave of part one) was going to be in part 2 Guess not. I just think they should of killed her off like in Friday The 13th Part 2 (you know what I mean).<br /><br />This movie like Scream 3, and Urban Legend 2 followed movies within a movie.<br /><br />This was PURE CRAP! The whole Movie within a Movie crap.<br /><br />BAD STAY AWAY!",
    "Viewers gushing over everything including the title sequence (now THAT is funny) would have us believe this is some sort of cinematic miracle, but, trust me folks, this is one of the most embarrassingly bad films you could ever see, and if you're not laughing at it five minutes in, I'd say you've lost your sense of humor.<br /><br />David Niven plays a doomed and bravado-besotted RAF pilot who somehow thinks it appropriate to engage an impressionable (female) air traffic controller in an emotional conversation about love, just as he's plunging to his certain and fiery death. (Isn't it romantic...) Of course, he's spared by a quirk of metaphysical chance, and washes up on the beach, just as this same air traffic controller is riding by on her bicycle. (They immediately clinch).<br /><br />Looking past the bizarre homo-erotic subtexts, (so over the top you really need to refer to them as supertexts, from a naked boy sitting bare-butted in the sand playing the movie's twilight-zone-esquire theme on his little flute, to a celestial courier so campy/queen-y his makeup is caked on more thoroughly than the ladies'), the most bizarre aspects of the movie are how it weaves such bad caricatures of national and racial stereotypes into a convoluted attempt to argue some kind of point about the universal nature and power of love. We get it--fly boys like girls in skirts and heels, and girls like 'em back, and, apparently, all you have to do is cry a little to make it noble enough for your movie to get 10 stars on IMDb...<br /><br />As for the quality of the production, the continuity/editing is poor enough to induce cringing, and the lighting is, perhaps, even worse than that, but you hardly have time to notice because the script is so bad. There are games played with Technicolor, (whatever passes for heaven is in black and white if you can figure out the sense in that), and foreshadowing, (so funny my fellow audience member who usually like movies like this actually cheered and laughed when then the doc's motorcycle finally ended up in a fiery wreck), and freeze-motion, (which is funniest of all because the female lead is so poor at standing still you know the stage hands were guffawing off camera).<br /><br />The best shots are the early ones on the beach, but, after that, it's all downhill. The (moving like an escalator is moving) staircase is hardly the Odessa Steps, to say the least, and I'd really caution anyone from feeling like they'd have to see this lame attempt at movie-making on their account. The movie overall is bad enough to be funny, and that's about the best thing I can say for it."

    "I rented \"I Am Curious-Yellow\" from my video store due to the controversy surrounding its 1967 release. I was intrigued by the fact that it was initially seized by U.S. customs, and as a fan of provocative films, I had to see it for myself.\n\nThe film follows Lena, a young Swedish drama student who wants to learn about life and create a documentary on the average Swede's views on political issues like the Vietnam War and U.S. race relations. As she interviews politicians and ordinary Stockholmers, she also engages in affairs with her drama teacher, classmates, and married men.\n\nWhat struck me about \"I Am Curious-Yellow\" is that it was considered pornographic 40 years ago. In reality, the sex and nudity scenes are sparse and not gratuitous. While they may have shocked American audiences, sex and nudity are common in Swedish cinema, even in the films of renowned directors like Ingmar Bergman.\n\nI commend the filmmakers for using sex scenes for artistic purposes, rather than to shock or profit. \"I Am Curious-Yellow\" is a valuable film for those interested in exploring Swedish cinema. However, it lacks a strong plot, making it more of a curiosity than a compelling narrative.",
    "The film 'I Am Curious: Yellow' is a laughable and pretentious mess. Regardless of one's political views, it's impossible to take this film seriously on any level. The claim that frontal male nudity automatically warrants an NC-17 rating is false. I've seen R-rated films that feature male nudity, albeit briefly. However, it's notable that there are no R-rated films that showcase female genitalia. This disparity is also evident in cable shows, where male nudity is common but female nudity is absent. Even in indie films like 'The Brown Bunny', which features Vincent Gallo's explicit nudity, female genitalia are conspicuously absent. Before accusing the film industry of a double standard, it's essential to acknowledge the obvious anatomical difference between men and women. When actresses appear nude, their genitals are not visible, whereas male nudity is more explicit. In fact, female genitalia are rarely depicted in American films, except in porn or explicit erotica. This so-called double standard is actually a reflection of our cultural discomfort with the female body.",
    "This film is a failed experiment that fails to tell a coherent story. It touches on important issues, but without a clear purpose or message. Watching it is a waste of time, and you're unlikely to gain any new insights. You'd be better off staring out the window at a tree growing.",
    "Get ready for a cinematic adventure! While this film may have drawn inspiration from Godard's iconic Masculin, féminin (which I highly recommend you check out!), it's a unique ride in its own right.\n\nThere are two standout elements that truly shine: the incredibly realistic acting and the stunning, top-notch photography. But what really caught my attention was the film's playful, lighthearted vibe - it's a fun, carefree ride! Lena Nyman's performance is particularly noteworthy, bringing a fresh energy to the screen. And let's be real, the nudity is just a bonus!\n\nWhile it may not be as intellectually stimulating as Godard's masterpiece, this film has a certain je ne sais quoi that's hard to resist. It's a true product of its time and place, and that's what makes it so charming. So if you're in the mood for something fun and flirty, give it a try! 2/10 may seem low, but trust me, it's a hidden gem waiting to be discovered!",
    "I've heard about this infamous film for years, and all I can think of is the classic Peggy Lee song \"Is That All There Is?\" I was just a teenager when it first came out in the US, but I was too young to see it in theaters. Later, I had the chance to watch it at a film museum, but by then I was as old as my parents were when they first saw it!\n\nThe only reason this film didn't fade into obscurity is because of the controversy surrounding its release. Millions of people flocked to see it, thinking it was a risqué film, but instead, they got a bunch of unimpressive scenes with unattractive actors, bland interviews, and pretentious political messages.\n\nDespite its lackluster content, some people still try to find value in its supposedly revolutionary politics. But let's be real, if it weren't for the censorship scandal, this film would have been forgotten long ago.\n\nThe title's catchy rhythm has been parodied and reused in various forms over the years, from porn films to blaxploitation movies. Every decade or so, a new generation discovers it and thinks it's some kind of groundbreaking, taboo-breaking film. But trust me, it's not worth the hype.\n\nUnless you're really curious, I'd say skip it altogether. If you must see it, just fast-forward to the \"racy\" parts and get it over with.",
    "This film tops my list of unwatchable trash. It's not just bad, but pretentiously so, trying to pass off its amateurish Marxism and unarousing sex scenes as intellectually stimulating. The self-consciously arty approach falls flat, with harsh, grainy black-and-white photography, out-of-focus shots, and poor sound quality. It's astonishing that some people consider this art.",
    "It's clear the screenwriter behind this Lucille Ball biopic didn't crack open a single book about the legendary comedian, including her own autobiography. The result is a film riddled with errors, from her humble beginnings in Celoron and Jamestown to her iconic years with Desi. I could fill a novel with the factual faux pas, but suffice it to say, it's a mess. Lucille Ball was a true original, and it seems she's one of the few people who could truly play herself. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I'd be fuming over the liberties taken with their family's story. Despite the filmmakers' best efforts, the movie feels like a sloppy tribute to a comedy legend.",
    "Upon initial exposure to this film, I was immediately struck by the actress cast as Lucille Ball, Rachel York. Unfortunately, her portrayal of the iconic comedian falls woefully short. Lucille Ball was a comedic genius with unparalleled talent, and it is nothing short of egregious to consider the manner in which she was represented in this movie. It is astonishing that, among the vast pool of talented actresses, the producers opted for Rachel York, who, despite her potential in other roles, is miscast as Lucy. The challenge of capturing Lucille Ball's essence lies not only in her remarkable talent but also in her distinctive physical appearance. It is disappointing that the filmmakers failed to find an actress who could even remotely approximate Ball's likeness and charisma.\n\nFurthermore, Rachel York's interpretation of Lucy in scenes inspired by classic episodes of I Love Lucy, such as the chocolate factory and vitavetavegamin, bears no resemblance to the original in terms of expression, voice, or movement. The disparity is jarring and detracts from the overall viewing experience.\n\nThe casting of Danny Pino as Desi Arnaz is equally misguided. Pino lacks the physical presence, authentic accent, and acting chops to convincingly portray Ricky. While the actors playing Fred and Ethel are not ideal, they are less egregious than the misfires in the casting of Lucy and Ricky.\n\nIn conclusion, the film's casting is a catastrophic failure, and the narrative is poorly executed. For a more accurate and nuanced understanding of Lucille Ball's life, I recommend exploring alternative sources, such as the A&E Biography of Lucy and Desi, Lucille Ball's autobiography, or PBS' American Masters: Finding Lucy. Alternatively, the docudrama \"Before the Laughter\" offers a more satisfactory portrayal of the iconic couple, with a casting choice that, at the very least, captures a semblance of their essence.",
    "\"The Mysterious Case of 'They All Laughed': A Cinematic Enigma\"\n\nIn the midst of a cinematic landscape littered with self-indulgent productions, \"They All Laughed\" stands out as a peculiar anomaly. But who exactly are the culprits behind this bloated, frivolous film? Certainly not the audience, who are left bewildered by the on-screen shenanigans. It's as if the cast and crew were having the time of their lives, but forgot to bring the actual work ethic to the set.\n\nJohn Ritter's bespectacled doppelganger of director Peter Bogdanovich is a clever touch, but his scenes with the lovely Dorothy Stratten reek of a \"look-at-me-I'm-dating-the-prom-queen\" vibe. Ben Gazzara's signature smirk can't elevate the lackluster plot, which has him pursuing Audrey Hepburn with all the enthusiasm of a sleepy sloth. Meanwhile, the budding couple's kids (Bogdanovich's daughters, no less) spew cute and pick up some questionable lessons on love from their parents. Hepburn, bless her, manages to rise above the chaos, but even she can't salvage this mess.\n\nThe film's biggest crime? It's all style, no substance. Everyone looks fabulous, but that's not exactly a feat in a movie. If you want to ogle pretty people, grab a copy of Vogue instead. And then there's Colleen Camp, whose singing is competent but unconvincing, and whose country-western numbers clash with the standards on the soundtrack. It's a far cry from the charm of Gershwin's stage musicals.\n\nDespite its good intentions, \"They All Laughed\" is a misfire that coasts on its own ego. It's a shame, really, given the emotional investment in Stratten's scenes. But even Bogdanovich's personal connection to the film can't redeem its overall lack of charm. If you want to experience joy and love on screen, stick with the masters – Ernest Lubitsch and Jaques Demy. This one's a harmless but forgettable waste of rental space.",
    "Director Peter Bogdanovich's personal film is loosely based on his own life, but with a twist: the main characters are detectives who effortlessly date stunning models. This idealized portrayal of detectives as millionaire playboys rather than gritty crime-solvers may strike a chord with Bogdanovich's own privileged lifestyle, but it alienates the average viewer. As the sole writer of the film, Bogdanovich's detachment from reality is evident, making the movie feel like an insider's joke that only resonates with a select few.\n\nThe film's main draw is the appearance of Dorothy Stratten, a model who tragically met her demise shortly after filming. However, Patti Hansen, who would later marry Keith Richards, steals the show with her more substantial role. Stratten's character, on the other hand, feels like an afterthought, with minimal impact on the already convoluted plot.\n\nUltimately, the film's characters are so far removed from reality that only a select few - namely, wealthy Manhattanites with supermodel connections - can relate to them. For the rest of the audience, the movie is a self-indulgent, cringe-worthy experience that showcases Bogdanovich's disconnect from his viewers.",
    "I was thrilled to see some of my favorite stars from 30 years ago, including John Ritter, Ben Gazzara, and Audrey Hepburn, who all looked wonderful. However, they were not given substantial characters or memorable lines to work with. As a result, I struggled to understand or care about what the characters were doing.\n\nThe smaller female roles, played by Patty Henson and Colleen Camp, were a highlight, as they brought competence and confidence to their sidekick parts. It's a shame they didn't go on to star in more prominent films. Unfortunately, Dorothy Stratten didn't get the opportunity to showcase her acting skills in this, her only significant film role.\n\nDespite having fans, I found myself struggling to stay engaged while watching this film. As a big Peter Bogdanovich fan, I was surprised by my lack of enthusiasm, especially given my enjoyment of his previous films, such as \"Cat's Meow\" and his early works like \"Targets\" and \"Nickleodeon\".\n\nIt's ironic that this movie revolves around a detective agency where romantic relationships develop between detectives and clients. Five years later, Bogdanovich's ex-girlfriend, Cybill Shepherd, starred in the hit TV series \"Moonlighting\", which borrowed a similar concept. The key difference lies in the fact that \"Moonlighting\" relied on witty dialogue, whereas this film attempts to rely on slapstick humor and a few screwball lines.\n\nUltimately, this film falls short of Bogdanovich's classics like \"Paper Moon\" and is only a pale imitation of \"What's Up, Doc\".",
    "I'm surprised to see so many positive reviews of this movie, as it didn't quite resonate with me. I went in with low expectations, but unfortunately, the script fell flat for me. On the bright side, the actors and technical crew did a great job with what they had to work with. If you're a fan of Ben G, Dorothy S, or Peter B, you might want to check out some of their other films that showcase their talents better. And if you're in the mood for a lighthearted laugh, there are other options out there that might hit the spot!",
    "Avoid casting models and Playboy bunnies in your films at all costs! Bob Fosse's 'Star 80', a biographical drama about Dorothy Stratten, is infinitely more captivating than Stratten's own on-screen presence. The film's intrigue stems from its exploration of Stratten's tragic life, including her marriage to director Peter Bogdanovich, who later married her sister after her brutal murder at the hands of her husband. In contrast, Stratten's own acting abilities, like those of Patty Hansen, are underwhelming. I expected a cinematic masterpiece akin to Orson Welles' works, but instead, I was met with a lackluster performance, complete with an unflattering hairstyle and awkward jeans. The film's disappointing quality is likely the real reason it wasn't released, not the controversy surrounding Stratten's death. In comparison, classics like 'Paper Moon' and 'The Last Picture Show' are timeless and deserving of multiple viewings, whereas 'Star 80' was a struggle to sit through even once.",
    "While the talented cast shines and the director's affection for New York City is infectious, the real issue with this film lies in its lackluster script. The actors' instant romance, devoid of meaningful dialogue, may be a reality in the director's Hollywood bubble, but it's a far cry from the authentic experiences of everyday people. This superficial portrayal of love reduces the movie to a hollow, shallow, and ultimately, message-less affair. It's a shame, because with a more thoughtful and realistic script, this film could have been something truly special. As it stands, it's a missed opportunity to explore the complexities of love and relationships in the city that never sleeps.",
    "I stumbled upon this old VHS tape of \"They All Laughed\" at a rental store, and it was super cheap. I had no idea what the movie was about, but the cover caught my attention - Peter Bogdanovich, Audrey Hepburn, John Ritter, and Dorothy Stratten were all listed, so I figured it was worth a shot. I checked the IMDb rating, which was a decent 6.0, and then looked it up in this old video guidebook from 2003, which gave it four stars. So, I decided to give it a watch. \n\nHonestly, I just finished watching it, and it was a total snooze-fest. The characters were super underdeveloped, and I spent way too much time trying to figure out what was going on. The plot was supposed to be funny - private eyes falling in love with the women they're chasing - but I didn't crack a smile the whole time. The coincidences in the movie were ridiculous, especially in a huge city like New York. And Ben Gazarra playing this super charming, seductive guy who has women falling all over him? Yeah, it didn't really work for me.\n\nThe only good things about the movie were the cameos from Dorothy Stratten (the Playboy playmate who was tragically murdered by her husband), Patti Hansen (who's still super hot), and Audrey Hepburn, who's always amazing. Oh, and there's this one song, \"Amigo\", by Roberto Carlos, which is pretty cool. I'll keep the movie just because of those few highlights, but overall, I'd give it a 4 out of 10.",
    "**A Cinematic Disaster**\n\nThis film is an unmitigated disaster. John Ritter's pratfalls are the least of its problems. A staggering 75% of the actors deliver their lines with all the passion of cue card readers. The editing is sloppy, the sound mixing is atrocious (with dialogue often drowned out by background noise), and the plot is a meandering mess that goes nowhere.\n\nDorothy Stratten, surprisingly, is not the worst actress in this trainwreck. That distinction belongs to at least three others, including Patti Hansen, who delivers her lines with all the enthusiasm of Ben Stein. I began to wonder if she was even alive. Even Peter Bogdanovich's own children are cringe-worthy, with the oldest clearly reading from a cue card.\n\nThis movie is a catastrophe. It's no wonder Bogdanovich didn't get another project for four years. Do yourself a favor and avoid it at all costs. If you see it listed on your TV guide, cancel your cable subscription. If a friend suggests watching it, reconsider the friendship. If your spouse wants to watch it, it may be time to find a new partner. I'd rather subject myself to physical torture than sit through this garbage again.\n\nIn one word, this film can be summed up as: **Suckotrocity**.",
    "I bought this video because I'm a fan of Dorothy Stratten, but unfortunately, it didn't live up to my expectations. Despite featuring a talented cast, the film was overwhelmed by too many subplots, making it hard to stay engaged. The dialogue was stilted and confusing, and the story jumped around in a way that felt unrealistic. I was disappointed, especially since it was one of Audrey Hepburn's later films. John Ritter, who I usually enjoy in comedic roles, came across as pathetic in this movie.",
    "Next weekend, I'm tempted to grab my camera and make a movie that'll put this disaster to shame. But, alas, I have a pesky day job to attend to. I can only assume the creators of this catastrophe must have had a few spare hours to throw together this...this...abomination. I sincerely hope they have a steady 9-to-5 to fall back on, because this film is a travesty. It looks like a hastily assembled home movie, with a budget that wouldn't even cover a decent lunch. The real question is, who in their right mind greenlit this monstrosity?!",
    "Pros: Zilch\n\nCons: Everything and the kitchen sink\n\nPlot summary: So, there's this reporter chick who picks up a hitchhiker who's got some crazy stories to tell about people getting killed by zombies. Yeah, that's pretty much it.\n\nReview: I've seen some stinkers in my time, but The Zombie Chronicles takes the cake. It looks like they made this thing on a shoestring budget of, like, 20 bucks. The acting is atrocious, the gore is more gross than scary, and the whole thing is just a hot mess. I mean, how does something like this even get greenlit? Trust me, avoid this movie like the plague.\n\nMy two cents: The funniest part is that it was made by a company called Brain Damage Films. I guess their brains must've been damaged to come up with something this bad!\n\nRating: 1 out of 10 (if I could, I'd give it a -1 billion)",
    "To the creators of \"Zombie Chronicles,\" I offer these constructive criticisms in the hopes of helping you elevate your craft:\n\nFirstly, when crafting a \"Twist Ending\"-type movie, it's essential to preserve the element of surprise. Avoid revealing every death in the movie through close-ups in the opening credits, as this can spoil the twists and undermine the audience's engagement.\n\nSecondly, while I acknowledge the impressive feats you achieved with your limited budget, it's crucial to invest in actors who can deliver convincing performances. The ability to walk, talk, and gesture simultaneously is a fundamental aspect of acting, and it's essential to cast actors who can meet these basic requirements. Joe Haggerty, I urge you to take this feedback to heart.\n\nThirdly, when setting a part of your movie in the past, it's vital to ensure that your props and costumes are period-accurate. Anything less can detract from the overall authenticity of the film and pull the audience out of the narrative.\n\nLastly, a successful twist ending should be both surprising and logical. While it's essential to avoid introducing twists that come out of left field, it's equally important to avoid telegraphing the reveal from the moment a character is introduced. Striking a balance between surprise and coherence is key to crafting a compelling narrative.\n\nWhile I appreciate the effort that went into creating \"Zombie Chronicles,\" I believe that by addressing these areas, you can create a more engaging and immersive cinematic experience. For now, I would only recommend this film to die-hard zombie enthusiasts.",
    "I watched this movie on 8/3/2003 and gave it 2 out of 10. The director, Brad Sykes, made a pointless 3D movie about zombies eating people in a three-part story. We've seen this before in 2D zombie movies, and it's not impressive. What makes a good zombie movie is the story behind it, not just the gore. This movie was boring because the ending was slow and easy to figure out. The last part of the movie was actually the same as the beginning, with a reporter investigating a ghost town and, of course, more zombies eating people. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this movie. Instead, watch the classic zombie movies.",
    "Get ready for a cinematic letdown! This movie promises a bevy of beauties, but disappointingly, it's a nudity-free zone. Strike one against the filmmakers!\n\nBut that's not the only blunder. The story takes us back to 1971, yet the main characters are cruising around in a Kia Sportage. Um, hello? Continuity, anyone? It's like they forgot to do their homework.\n\nAnd if you're expecting a thrilling 3D experience, think again. The stereoscopic 3D effect is a total disaster. It's like someone botched the job, leaving us with a blurry, double-vision mess. I've seen better 3D efforts from this company before, but this one is a complete fail.\n\nAll in all, this movie is a big ball of nothing. But hey, there is one redeeming quality - the stunning actress who plays the daughter of the ear-eating lady. She's a real treat, reminiscent of a young Janet Margolin. Let's hope to see more of her on the big screen soon!",
    "Get ready for a terrifying detour into the heart of horror with The Zombie Chronicles, a low-budget anthology that promises more than it delivers. When a curious reporter picks up a mysterious hitchhiker on a deserted road, she's treated to two gruesome tales of zombie terror that will leave you shivering in fear. But beware, these stories are not for the faint of heart - an adulterous couple's deadly plot takes a dark turn when they're attacked by the undead, and a group of campers learns the hard way that you shouldn't mess with an outlaw's grave.\n\nDespite its promising premise, The Zombie Chronicles falls flat due to subpar acting, uninspired locations, and a dull script. The only redeeming qualities are the creative camera work and enthusiastic gore effects, which will satisfy fans of B-movie horror. But be warned, even the most seasoned viewers of z-grade trash may find themselves struggling to stay engaged.\n\nWith a rating of 2/10, The Zombie Chronicles is a disappointing ride that fails to deliver on its promise of zombie thrills. Even the addition of 3D wouldn't be enough to save this lackluster effort. So, if you're looking for a truly terrifying experience, you may want to look elsewhere.",
    "Get ready for a thrilling challenge! Brad Sykes' film may not be the most polished, but it's a great opportunity to unleash your own creativity. The acting and production quality may be lacking, but that's what makes it the perfect inspiration to create your own zombie-themed masterpiece. Take it as a dare to showcase your skills on YouTube and make something truly unforgettable.\n\nYes, I only paid £1 for this film, but the real cost is the 71 minutes of your life you'll spend watching it. So, take this as a warning: unless you're looking for a fun challenge or a good laugh, you might want to skip this one. But who knows, you might just find yourself inspired to create something amazing!",
    "\"The Great Zombie Debacle: A Cautionary Tale of Cinematic Catastrophe\"\n\nMy girlfriend thought she was playing a prank on me by bringing home The Zombie Chronicles, but little did she know, she was the one who'd end up getting punk'd – to the tune of £1, no less! As we suffered through this abomination, I found myself conjuring up a laundry list of activities I'd rather endure than sit through this monstrosity. The highlights (or lowlights, rather) included:\n\n* Gargling bleach like it was a refreshing cocktail\n* Exfoliating my eyes with sandpaper\n* Penning a heartfelt apology letter to Brad Sykes and Garrett Clancy for subjecting them to this drivel\n* Reenacting the entire American Civil War – solo, and in my living room\n* Crunching numbers for tax season with a smile\n* Reliving the thrill of GCSE Maths exams\n* And, ahem, getting cozy with a senior citizen (no judgment, please)\n\nGarrett Clancy, aka Sgt. Ben Draper, is the mastermind behind this mess. I'm pretty sure he'd struggle to dig a hole to bury this film's script. The only redeeming quality? He managed to kick down a door with gusto – the sole highlight of this trainwreck. I've seen some stinkers in my time, including White Noise: The Light, but this one takes the (rotten) cake. My girlfriend abandoned it at my place, leaving me to live with the shame of owning this cinematic abomination.\n\nBreaking news: Owen Wilson reportedly watched this film and subsequently tried to end it all. Okay, maybe that's not entirely true, but I wouldn't put it past him.\n\nSo, let this be a warning to you all: AVOID THE ZOMBIE CHRONICLES LIKE THE PLAGUE!",
    "Low-budget films can sometimes surprise us with their quality, but unfortunately, this one falls short. \n\nBrad Sykes' latest effort is a disappointment, with subpar acting, except for Emmy Smith, who shows some potential. The camera work is amateurish, and the \"run-and-gun\" technique is ineffective. The special effects are uninspired and easily recognizable, which detracts from the viewing experience. The scenery is dull and uninteresting, much like Sykes' other films, and the music is a jarring mix of cheap, porn-like scores and bad metal. \n\nThe plot and character development are virtually non-existent, suggesting a lack of effort from the scriptwriter. It's puzzling that Sykes continues to receive funding for his projects, given the consistent poor quality of his work. Unlike other amateur filmmakers who learn from their mistakes, Sykes seems to be stuck in a rut. \n\nThis film is not even worthy of being a mindless, popcorn-fueled distraction. In fact, watching it is more painful than chewing on popcorn kernels. The only notable aspect of the film is its atrocious depiction of military push-ups, which earns it the dubious award for worst ever.",
    "I must admit, I was pleasantly surprised by this film. Despite its flaws, I found myself engaged enough to watch it not once, but twice! The storyline was certainly unconventional, and I'll admit that the first part of the first short story had me scratching my head. But in a strange way, its campy humor and over-the-top moments won me over. It's a guilty pleasure that delivers cheap laughs in spades.\n\nJebidia's performance, in particular, stood out to me. He fully committed to his role and had me in stitches with his creative insults. If I have one criticism, it's that he toned down his antics halfway through the film. Still, his performance was Oscar-worthy in my book.\n\nOverall, I'd say this film is a hidden gem. If you're in the mood for something lighthearted and silly, and you can find it at a bargain price, I'd definitely recommend giving it a try.",
    "While some bargain bin films can be surprisingly enjoyable, others are regrettable purchases. The 23rd Century film label, for instance, released a mix of obscure Italian and American movies, including some hidden gems. However, Hardgore's output is largely disappointing, with the exception of a few Fulci films. Unfortunately, their release of \"The Zombie Chronicles\" is a prime example of their subpar offerings.\n\nThe only redeeming quality of this film is that it's less annoying than \"The Stink of Flesh.\" Otherwise, it's a clumsy anthology film with amateurish technical skills. One notable issue is the inclusion of preview clips in the credit sequence, which spoils the suspense and makes the subsequent zombie attacks feel redundant.\n\nFans of bad cinema may find some entertainment in the film's numerous continuity errors and atrocious acting, particularly from the hitchhiker, whose performance is so poor it's almost laughable. Hardgore deserves credit for embracing the film's low-budget aesthetic, releasing a print that feels like a worn-out home video.\n\nUltimately, \"The Zombie Chronicles\" is a terrible film that's best avoided. While we've all experimented with filmmaking at some point, common sense dictates that such amateurish efforts should remain private and not be inflicted on the public.",
    "I was given this movie as a gift, and from the moment I saw the DVD cover, I had a bad feeling about it. It took me over a year to finally work up the courage to watch it, and I was not surprised to find that it was a complete disaster.\n\nI almost didn't make it through to the end, but I felt obligated to watch the entire thing before writing a review. Let me tell you, this movie is a total waste of time. I'm still shocked that someone managed to secure funding to produce such a low-quality film. It looks like it was made on a shoestring budget of around $20,000, with a cheap camera and a cast of 15 people who can't act to save their lives. The script appears to have been written by a couple of people who were drunk at the time.\n\nThe movie starts off with a reporter named Tara Woodley who runs over a supposedly drunk man on her way to cover a story about a haunted town. Miraculously, the man is unharmed, and they end up in an abandoned house that just happens to be fully furnished, with a bottle of liquor conveniently placed on the doorstep. As they settle in, the drunk man starts telling Tara ghost stories and zombie tales.\n\nThe first story he tells is probably the worst I've ever heard. It's about a sergeant named Ben Draper who lets one of his soldiers, Private Wilson, die from exhaustion after making him do sit-ups and dig a grave. Ben then buries the soldier in a shallow grave, but his wife or girlfriend finds out and, along with her lover, kills Ben to avenge Private Wilson's death. In a ridiculous twist, the soldier comes back to life as a zombie and kills them in revenge.\n\nThe ending is laughably bad. Even if you're a fan of B-horror movies, I would strongly advise against wasting your time on this one.",
    "I must confess that I have not had the opportunity to view a large number of low-budget films. However, I can confidently assert that this particular movie is likely the worst I have ever seen. The main character, an elderly gentleman, delivered his lines in a manner that suggested he had undergone a lobotomy, struggling to utter more than a single word every five seconds. His acting abilities were surpassed by those of a typical five-year-old child. The plot was utterly atrocious, and the actor portraying the army officer's attempt to emulate a military persona was grossly exaggerated. I persisted in watching the film solely to derive amusement from its inadequacies, hoping that it would eventually transition into a more substantial narrative. I am astonished that it was included in the two-night rental selection at Blockbuster, rather than being offered for free as a courtesy to customers. Notably, there was one semi-competent actor, excluding the female lead. The only redeeming aspect of the film's budget was the makeup design. Unfortunately, the opening credits sequence revealed every pivotal scene, thereby diminishing any potential suspense or intrigue. Overall, the movie was simply dreadful.",
    "Note to film enthusiasts: this movie is not for you, unless you want to brush up on basic cinematic concepts like continuity editing and geographic match. I found it disorienting, with characters jumping between the present day and the 1970s, driving modern SUVs, and wearing what appeared to be 1980s-style clothing. The acting was subpar, making it difficult to focus. The film likely gained attention due to its 3D feature, which I didn't watch. If you enjoy B-movies (and by that, I mean genuinely bad movies), you might find this film entertaining in a laughable, home-video kind of way. However, if you prefer the works of Godard and Antonioni, it's best to skip this one.",
    "Despite receiving lukewarm responses, Brad Sykes continues to produce low-budget horror films, earning a begrudging respect from critics. Even the faint praise for his Camp Blood series is given reluctantly, and I'm no exception. Sykes often injects an interesting idea or quirky character into his films, but due to limited funds, he relies on the audience's goodwill to appreciate his work for its potential rather than its execution. One notable exception is Joe Haggerty's energetic and humorous performance as Ebenezer Jackson, which Sykes wisely recognizes as a highlight of the film. Unfortunately, this movie is unlikely to appear in a mainstream theater anytime soon.",
    "THE ZOMBIE CHRONICLES: A Hidden Gem\n\nAspect ratio: 1.33:1 (Nu-View 3-D)\nSound format: Mono\n\nWhile exploring the American heartland, a curious journalist (Emmy Smith) stumbles upon a mysterious hitchhiker (Joseph Haggerty) who regales her with two spine-tingling tales of zombies said to roam the deserted landscape.\n\nDespite its low-budget roots, this underrated horror anthology showcases the raw talent of its cast and crew. Joseph Haggerty brings a gritty authenticity to his role, and the two stories that make up the bulk of the film are cleverly crafted to deliver maximum chills. Director Brad Sykes, known for his work on CAMP BLOOD (1999), proves himself a master of atmospheric tension, coaxing impressive performances from his actors. The 3-D format adds an extra layer of immersion, making this a must-see for fans of old-school horror. While it may not be a polished blockbuster, THE ZOMBIE CHRONICLES is a refreshingly unpretentious, no-frills horror experience that will leave you on the edge of your seat.",
    "**A Scathing Review of \"The Zombie Chronicles\" (2001)**\n\nThis disastrous horror film tells the story of a woman seeking directions to a mysterious town, only to be regaled with two zombie-themed tales by a local eccentric. However, the movie's poor execution and lack of focus on its titular characters make it a painful watch.\n\nWith a runtime of just 69 minutes, \"The Zombie Chronicles\" is surprisingly padded with unnecessary scenes, including a skinhead doing push-ups and cringe-worthy romantic moments between teenage characters. The acting is subpar, and the film's production values are abysmally low, with jerky camera work, print scratches, and flickering lights that make it look like it was shot on a mobile phone.\n\nThe zombie scenes, which are few and far between, are laughably bad, with unconvincing special effects and a general lack of tension or scares. The film's overall aesthetic, including the fashion and clothing, appears to be three decades out of date.\n\nI must warn potential viewers that sitting through this film is a chore, and even the most die-hard horror fans may find themselves struggling to make it to the end. The movie's release is a mystery, and it's a wonder that anyone thought it was worthy of distribution. Avoid \"The Zombie Chronicles\" at all costs, lest you want to risk damaging your DVD player or, worse, being forced to watch VHS tapes for the rest of your life. Rating: 0/10.\n\n**Additional Note:** The film's 18-rated horror credentials are further undermined by a bizarre sex scene in which the female lead keeps her sports bra on, adding to the overall sense of incompetence that pervades this disastrous movie.",
    "As a zombie fan, I regret spending $5 on this movie. It had a few cool moments, like a guy's head getting ripped off, but that's it. Watching it again would be torture. The only redeeming quality might be some nudity, but even that's lacking. Unless you enjoy pain, avoid this movie.",
    "I had the misfortune of renting a film approximately three years ago that has left an indelible mark on my memory as one of the most poorly crafted movies I've ever had the displeasure of watching. Unfortunately, I was unable to complete it due to its subpar quality. The production values were reminiscent of a amateurish high school project. One particular scene that stands out in my mind is a flashback sequence set in the 1970s, which featured a character wearing a polo shirt, Oakley sunglasses, and driving a modern SUV, such as a Toyota RAV-4. The anachronistic error was glaringly apparent and demonstrated a staggering lack of attention to detail. I also seem to recall the character possibly using a cell phone, although my memory of that specific detail is hazy. The overall experience was nothing short of cringeworthy. Upon returning the film to the video store, I expressed my disappointment to the staff and jokingly requested a refund of the hour I wasted on it. To this day, it remains the worst film I've ever seen, and I've had the misfortune of sitting through some truly terrible movies.",
    "I was disappointed with Love's Abiding Joy, which didn't live up to my expectations. The movie was overly sad and depressing, with too many mistakes, poor editing, and scenes out of context. The death of baby Kathy felt rushed, and Clark's appearance seemed forced. The actors lacked emotion, and there was little interaction between Missie and Willie.\n\nThe script deviated too far from Janette Oke's book, omitting key plot points like the mine accident and Clark's injury. I wish the movie had shown Missie and Willie's reactions to Kathy's death instead of just telling us.\n\nLove's Abiding Joy is my least favorite of the four movies so far. I hope the next ones will stay truer to the book and give Clark a more significant role. I'd also like to see more of Scottie, Cookie, and Marty.",
    "Disappointment Alert: 'Love's Abiding Joy' Falls Flat!\n\nAs a die-hard fan of the book series, I was thrilled to dive into the fourth installment of the movie franchise. But, oh, how my excitement was crushed! Each film strays further from the original stories, and this one takes the cake - or rather, it throws the cake out the window.\n\nThe biggest travesty? The movie bears no resemblance to the book it's named after. None. Zilch. The only faint connection is the character names - Willie, Missie, Henry, Clark, Scottie, and Cookie. That's it. The rest is a jumbled mess of incorrect details, from the kids' names and ages to the entire storyline.\n\nI'm appalled that the directors and producers would have the audacity to slap Janette Oke's title on a film that disrespects her work and her loyal fans. It's a disservice to the author, her books, and the people who love them.\n\nTo make matters worse, the music is overpowering, and the actors lack the emotional depth to bring the characters to life. If you're looking for a clean, family-friendly film, this might suffice. But if you're a fan of the book, beware: this is not the adaptation you're hoping for.\n\nHere's a plea to Michael Landon, Jr. and the team: if you're going to continue making movies based on these beloved books, please, for the love of all things good, stick to the original plot and storylines! The books are masterpieces, and with a faithful adaptation, they could become cinematic gems. Until then, I'll be holding out hope for a better, truer representation of Janette Oke's work.",
    "I was eagerly anticipating this film, and while it ultimately proved to be an enjoyable family movie, I couldn't help but feel that it fell short of its full potential. The editing team, led by Michael Landon Jr., could have done a more meticulous job in weaving the narrative together. At times, the scenes felt disjointed and lacked context, which detracted from the overall viewing experience. Despite this, I remain hopeful that another installment in the series will be made, as the previous films have been truly exceptional. However, I implore the filmmakers to exercise greater care in the editing process to ensure a more cohesive and engaging storyline. The characters of Willie and Missy are admirable role models, and their romantic journey is a compelling aspect of the series that resonates with audiences. With tighter editing, I have no doubt that future films could reach even greater heights.",
    "I was excited to watch the movie adaptation of the Love Come Softly books, which I've thoroughly enjoyed reading. While I understand that it's challenging to include every detail from the book in a film, I was hoping to see the main plot points and themes carried over. Unfortunately, the movie didn't quite live up to my expectations. One of the few similarities between the book and movie is the visit from Missy's father (although in the book, both parents visit). The storyline took some creative liberties that didn't resonate with me, and the overall tone felt overly somber. Even without comparing it to the book, I found the movie to be quite melancholic. I do appreciate the film's focus on family values, which is a hallmark of the series. Perhaps with some adjustments to the storytelling, the movie could have better captured the essence of the book.",
    "As a Southern Baptist, it's disheartening to give a subpar rating to a film that wears its Christian heart on its sleeve. I want to see more movies that boldly proclaim their faith, but 'Love's Abiding Joy' falls short. This low-budget, low-key production checks all the boxes of a stereotypical Christian film: a predictable plot, lackluster acting, and editing that's cringe-worthy. If it were a TV movie, it might have scraped by as average, but as a feature film, it's a letdown. I urge the filmmakers to keep pushing the boundaries and dig deeper to create a movie that truly captures the essence of real Christians. Take a cue from the masters like G. K. Chesterton and C. S. Lewis, who knew how to craft compelling stories that inspire and challenge. You've got this - I'm rooting for you to create something remarkable!",
    "As a kid, I thought the movie's weapon was cool, but the plot was stupid and boring. I'm surprised by the solid cast, considering the script must have been unimpressive. The plot is often incomprehensible, and the ending is chaotic. The film focuses too much on aliens and the weapon, with a weak storyline about two kids and a man who gets the alien weapon and goes on a killing spree. The movie fails to deliver on its promises, with unimpressive death scenes and a lackluster alien encounter. It's a disappointing and confusing film that doesn't live up to its potential.",
    "The movie follows Jill Dunne (Mitzi Kapture), a kind and attractive woman, as she struggles to cope with her self-centered teenage daughter Liv (Martha MacIsaac) and her unfaithful husband Sean (Rick Roberts). The family's dynamics are tense, with Liv's constant arguing and Sean's petty behavior making for an unbearable atmosphere.\n\nThe film's advertisement promised a thrilling story about a family being stalked by a crazed killer during a intense storm. However, the storm doesn't arrive until the last five minutes of the movie, and even then, it's underwhelming. The stalking itself doesn't become intense until the very end of the film.\n\nMost of the movie is spent watching Jill and Liv argue, with their constant bickering becoming exhausting. Jill's main concern is Liv's relationship with Zack, a boy with a questionable reputation, and their frequent make-out sessions. Meanwhile, Sean spends his time whining and criticizing Jill.\n\nThe story begins with Jill discovering an outstanding bill on their credit card for a hotel she's never been to, which leads her to suspect Sean of infidelity. She meets Richard Grant (Nick Mancuso), the hotel's owner and manager, who is kind and sympathetic towards her. When Richard tips her off about Sean's infidelity, Jill confronts him, but instead of taking action, she does nothing.\n\nJill and Richard start a romantic affair, but things take a strange turn when Richard becomes overly aggressive. Meanwhile, Jill and Sean have a confrontation about his cheating, with Sean blaming Jill for his lack of morals. The family decides to go on a camping trip, which only leads to more arguing and whining.\n\nBy the end of the movie, I was rooting for the stalker to get rid of the entire family, except for Jill. Overall, I would give this movie 3 stars.",
    "This movie was a catastrophic waste of my precious time. The acting was cringe-worthy, the plot a laughable farce. The 'thrilling' story follows a group of helpless victims who get 'terrorized' by a laughable lunatic, yet they fail to put up even a feeble fight. It's like they wanted to be victims. The absurdity begins with their ill-prepared camping trip, where they magically arrive at a fully-stocked campsite, complete with food, clothes, and even headphones. And when their boat disappears, they're paralyzed with fear, despite the fact that the daughter's boyfriend somehow manages to hike in to join them. You'd think they'd consider hiking out themselves, but nope. This movie is a joke, a complete and utter disaster. Don't let your girlfriend convince you to waste your time on this drivel.",
    "Underwhelming Experience Alert! Lifetime's latest attempt at a thriller fell flat for me. The plot was predictable and lacked any real twists, while the acting was subpar, especially from the teenage cast. It felt like I'd seen this same story played out a thousand times before. Were they just trying to give actors a paycheck? The previews had me excited for a gripping thriller, but unfortunately, this movie didn't deliver. Unless you're desperate for something to watch, I'd recommend skipping this one. It was a waste of two precious hours of my life - I'd rather have done just about anything else! Save yourself the disappointment and avoid this one at all costs.",
    "I'm seriously shocked by how much people love this movie - I just didn't get it. The whole 'visions from touching things' thing felt super cheesy to me. And what's up with the rule that if she touches something twice, the vision just keeps going? It all seemed pretty silly. Deedee Pfieffer's performance really grated on me, too - I found her super annoying. On the bright side, the actress who played Lori did a great job, and most of the supporting cast was solid considering what they had to work with.\n\nI'm usually a big fan of LMN and I'm always up for a new movie, but this one just didn't do it for me. The plot was way over the top and the acting was a bit too much. Oh well, can't win 'em all, right?",
    "The original book was set in the 1950s, but the TV series needed a 1930s aesthetic to appeal to its audience. Interestingly, the tube train featured near the end was a 1950s model repainted to resemble a 1930s train. The storyline, centered around the Jarrow March, felt forced, but it did encourage the student characters to think about social issues, much like the original 1950s version. The subplot about Japp fending for himself was underwhelming and seemed like filler content. Overall, this episode would have worked better as a half-hour show or a more faithful adaptation of the book. Unfortunately, it prioritized style over substance.",
    "I was disappointed to find that the inclusion of the mouse and lullaby elements in the narrative were distracting and unrelated to the plot. The execution of these elements seemed amateurish, reminiscent of a first-year film school project. Unfortunately, the storyline also suffered from pacing issues, with unnecessary tangents that failed to contribute to the overall narrative. This lack of focus suggests that the creative team may have been unclear about their vision or that the episode would have benefited from a more concise approach. Having recently watched all preceding episodes, I was particularly underwhelmed by this installment and feel compelled to caution others against starting with this episode.",
    "I was thrilled to catch this film on opening weekend in Australia, and with a talented cast like Ledger, Edgerton, Bloom, Watts, and Rush, I had high hopes for a compelling retelling of Ned Kelly's story. While the plot may not have been as rich as I'd anticipated, Heath Ledger's standout performance in the lead role more than made up for it. The supporting cast, particularly Edgerton, delivered strong performances, and Jordan's direction was confident and assured. The production design also deserves praise for its gritty portrayal of the Australian outback, which really immersed me in the world of the film. Although I may not have gotten the definitive Ned Kelly story I was hoping for, I still appreciated the unique take on this Australian legend. And let's be real, it's a relief that the filmmakers didn't compromise on the beards just to appease Hollywood! If I'm still craving more Ned Kelly, I can always turn to Peter Carey's fantastic \"True History of the Kelly Gang\". Overall, I'd give this film a solid 7/10.",
    "I had the misfortune of attending the Melbourne premiere of the latest Ned Kelly film, and I was thoroughly underwhelmed. The movie is a shallow, two-dimensional, and emotionally vacant retelling of the legendary outlaw's story. Despite the rich subject matter, the film is surprisingly dull, with a plodding script that fails to engage.\n\nThe actors do their best with the limited material they're given, but even their efforts can't elevate the lackluster storytelling. For those who feared that the film would be overly intellectualized, rest assured that it's completely devoid of literary depth, opting instead for a superficial, surface-level approach.\n\nUnfortunately, the film doesn't even work as a mindless action flick, thanks to its uneven pacing and subpar craftsmanship. It's hard to believe that director Gregor Jordan couldn't have done better with the material.\n\nNed Kelly is a fascinating figure, and his legend has captivated Australians for over 120 years. He's a complex character, embodying elements of folk genius, class warrior, and psychopath. It's a shame, then, that his story has once again been botched on the big screen.\n\nAs the saying goes, \"such is life.\" But in this case, it's a pity that the film couldn't have done justice to Kelly's remarkable legacy.",
    "Ned Kelly, the legendary Australian outlaw, is often romanticized as a Robin Hood-like figure who defied English aristocratic oppression and united the lower classes. But beneath the surface of this myth lies a more complex and nuanced truth. The film's portrayal of Kelly's story glosses over the fact that the majority of the lower classes at the time were immigrant criminals, and instead presents a sanitized and inaccurate version of history.\n\nThe warning signs were there from the start, with the film's opening credits claiming to be based on the book \"Our Sunshine\" - a title that screams romanticized truth. This wasn't going to be a historical epic, but rather a dramatized adaptation of one of many dubious legends surrounding Ned Kelly.\n\nUnfortunately, the film falls flat, plodding along at a snail's pace and lacking any real substance or depth. The performances are subpar, with cringe-worthy accents and beards that are more laughable than convincing. The direction is uninspired, relying on cheap tricks like pointless wildlife shots and a gratuitous circus scene featuring a lion and a camel.\n\nThis film is a turgid, emotionless piece of historical fluff that would have been better suited for a TV movie. Even the usually talented Geoffrey Rush seems embarrassed to be a part of it. The whole experience is akin to flipping through a series of bland and unengaging TV channels while nursing a hangover. The film's attempt to manipulate our emotions falls flat, and by the end, you'll be left wishing you could erase the memory of it from your mind.",
    "This film's take on Ned Kelly is a fantasy mashup of \"The Man from Snowy River\" and \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,\" with a romantic twist featuring high-society women. But despite the myths surrounding Kelly, there are well-documented facts that leave room for creative interpretation. Unlike ancient legends, Kelly's life is relatively recent history - my grandparents were in school when he was hanged. \n\nI had high hopes for this film after reading Peter Carey's novel \"The True History of the Kelly Gang,\" but it fell short. Ironically, Mick Jagger's 1970 film was probably more accurate and a better movie overall. I'm glad I only paid $2 to rent the DVD. I'd give it 3/10, mostly for the beautiful Australian landscapes.",
    "Get ready for a cinematic catastrophe! I just had the misfortune of watching one of the most atrocious films I've seen in a long time.\n\nHeath Ledger, the supposed heartthrob, looked more like a deformed outcast. I was left wondering what Naomi Watts saw in him - and it wasn't until later that I discovered they're a real-life couple! Two hours of my life wasted trying to figure out their on-screen chemistry.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on Orlando Bloom. His scraggly beard and deer-in-the-headlights expression made him look more like a homeless guy than a heartthrob.\n\nThe only redeeming quality was Rachel Griffiths, who shone with her usual fabulousness. But Geoffrey Rush looked like he'd rather be anywhere else. I couldn't blame him.\n\nThe film's attempt to make me sympathize with bank robbers and murderers fell flat. It was a far cry from the entertaining classic, Butch Cassidy. This movie was a cliché-ridden, boring disaster. We stuck around, hoping it would get better, but it only got worse.\n\nThe final 10-15 minutes were unintentionally hilarious, with Heath and his gang donning armor and storming out of a hotel. It was like a scene straight out of Monty Python and the Holy Grail! The audience was in stitches, but not in a good way. As we left the theater, everyone was buzzing about what a waste of time this film was.\n\nI may not have paid cash to see this disaster, but it still cost me two precious hours of my life that I'll never get back.",
    "Imagine if Robin Hood were Australian, and you'd get Ned Kelly - a folk hero and outlaw who stole from the rich and gave to the poor. But instead of Sherwood Forest, he roamed the Australian countryside, fighting against the government and its mistreatment of Irish immigrants.\n\nNed Kelly's story is one of injustice and rebellion. Falsely accused of shooting a law officer, he became a fugitive and turned to bank robbery to get back at the system that wronged him and his family. Along with his brother and friends, he won the hearts of many with his daring heists and sense of justice.\n\nHowever, the movie \"Ned Kelly\" feels like we've seen it all before. It's a familiar tale of a \"gentleman bandit\" with a heart of gold, who only kills when necessary and has a way with the common people. The film checks all the boxes of the genre's stereotypes and clichés, from the heroic outlaw to the determined law enforcer hot on his tail.\n\nHeath Ledger's portrayal of Ned Kelly lacks depth and charisma, and the voice-over narration only adds to the film's pretentiousness. While \"Ned Kelly\" might serve as a history lesson, it's ultimately just a rehashing of a familiar story with different accents.",
    "I was astonished by the sheer awfulness of this movie. The directing, editing, production, and script were amateurish, reminiscent of a junior high school project. The narrative was disjointed and nonsensical, with pivotal moments and character relationships emerging out of nowhere without proper setup. The characters were woefully underdeveloped, making it impossible to form a connection with them. Although the acting was surprisingly decent, it was overshadowed by the atrocious writing. The film felt like a low-budget TV western/epic, and it did a disservice to the fascinating true story it attempted to tell. While some reviewers have defended the film due to its importance to Australian history, I argue that the subject matter's significance doesn't excuse the movie's poor quality. Just as Pearl Harbor's historical significance didn't redeem its cinematic shortcomings, Ned Kelly's importance to Australian history can't salvage this film's failures. Overall, it was a disappointing effort, although Heath Ledger and Orlando Bloom were pleasant to watch.",
    "I was eager to watch this movie when it finally became available on DVD, since it never made it to theaters in my area. However, I wish I had heeded the critics' warnings and skipped it altogether.\n\nDespite boasting an impressive cast, including Bloom, Ledger, and Rush, the movie fell flat. It's clear why it went straight to video.\n\nI had high hopes, given the actors' past successes, but the film's slow pace and lack of engaging characters left me underwhelmed. I struggled to connect with the story and found myself tempted to fast-forward to the end.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this film, even for its visual appeal. It fails to deliver on all fronts.",
    "Get ready for a crushing disappointment! I walked into this film expecting a thrilling retelling of a beloved Australian tale, but what I got was a clunky, uninspired mess. The usually reliable Heath Ledger and Orlando Bloom tried their best to inject some life into their characters, but even their talents couldn't salvage this lackluster production.\n\nThe opening scene had all the potential to be a gripping, adrenaline-fueled ride, but instead, it fell flat. A flashback sequence or a bold, action-packed intro could have set the tone for a compelling story, but no such luck. Every scene that followed was as predictable as a bad soap opera, with plot twists that were telegraphed from a mile away.\n\nI was genuinely excited to see this movie, but my enthusiasm was quickly replaced with frustration and boredom. The only faint praise I can offer is that it's marginally better than the infamous Mick Jagger version, but that's hardly a ringing endorsement. Overall, this film is a misfire that fails to deliver on its promise.",
    "The cinematic adaptation of Ned Kelly's remarkable story is a profound disappointment. As an iconic Australian figure, his legend deserves a film that honors his heritage. Unfortunately, this movie falls short, with a setting that feels more akin to America than the Australian outback. Furthermore, the casting choice of an Irish-accented Ned Kelly is jarringly incongruous, given his Australian roots. Overall, this film is a regrettable misfire, ranking among the worst I've had the misfortune of watching in recent memory.",
    "From the outset, the political undertones of this film are overt and heavy-handed, rendering the outcome entirely predictable. A fundamental principle of screenplay writing, as outlined in any reputable textbook, is the importance of layered character development, character arcs, and a three-act structure. Unfortunately, these essential elements are absent in this film. The police are portrayed as one-dimensional villains, depicted as incompetent, cowardly, and shallow. It appears that the filmmakers failed to consider the possibility that police officers may be honorable citizens who join the force to contribute positively to society.\n\nThe viewer is not afforded the opportunity to form an independent opinion regarding Ned Kelly's character, as the film does not provide sufficient context to determine his guilt or innocence. The film opens with his arrest for horse theft, but the audience is not privy to any evidence or insight into his culpability. Furthermore, Kelly's imprisonment is only mentioned in passing dialogue, leaving the viewer without a clear understanding of his backstory.\n\nThe film features numerous shots of Ned Kelly gazing directly at the camera with a serious expression, a technique that quickly becomes tiresome. Overall, I found the film to be a laborious viewing experience, and its shortcomings have discouraged me from watching similar modern films.",
    "I was drawn to this film because of its intriguing storyline and the presence of its leading actor, so I decided to give it a try. Directed by Gregor Jordan, known for Buffalo Soldiers, the movie tells the story of Ned Kelly, played by Heath Ledger, who is wrongly accused by the police, particularly Superintendent Francis Hare, played by Geoffrey Rush. Forced to go on the run, Ned forms a gang to clear his and his family's names. Unfortunately, I didn't give the film my full attention, so that's about all I can say about the plot. The cast also includes Orlando Bloom, Naomi Watts, and Rachel Griffiths, among others. Heath Ledger delivers a solid performance, and the film has some visually striking moments, including an intense gun battle towards the end. However, since I didn't watch it closely, I can't say I fully enjoyed it.",
    "I must confess that I am utterly perplexed by the rating accorded to The Amati Girls, and I believe I was excessively generous in awarding it a paltry 4 out of 10. What had the potential to be a captivating narrative, bolstered by a cast of moderately talented actors, ultimately devolved into a laughable farce in my estimation. The film is replete with trite clichés, the hairstyles of the female characters are aesthetically unpleasing, and a significant number of scenes are either implausible or contrived. The movie lacks genuine passion, instead featuring a cast of actors who overact to an extent that is downright painful. It fails to elicit sufficient humor to be considered a comedy, and its sentimental moments are too artificial to evoke any emotional resonance, rendering it, in my opinion, a subpar film. I was flabbergasted that such a production managed to find its way onto my television set in my Swiss living room. However, it is possible that the film's shortcomings were lost in translation, and it may have been more effective in its original context. Nevertheless, it remains one of the most bizarre movies I have had the misfortune of watching, and certainly not in a positive sense. I apologize for my candid assessment.",
    "This movie was a crushing disappointment. The ending was atrocious, and the plot was virtually non-existent. The only redeeming qualities were the outstanding performances by Robert Duvall and James Earl Jones, which were tragically wasted on a dull, meandering script. The dialogue was mundane and lacked purpose, feeling like a series of uneventful conversations that failed to drive the story forward. The characters were unremarkable, except for Duvall's memorable portrayal of a rambling, senile old man. The entire movie takes place in a single day, which severely limits its narrative potential. As the credits rolled, I was left stunned that I'd invested two hours of my life in a film with no plot, no meaning, and no story to speak of. The talented cast was grossly underserved by this lackluster effort.",
    "I was thoroughly disappointed with this film, which I consider to be one of the worst I've seen in a long time. While the performances from the cast are adequate, the movie lacks a coherent plot. The storyline is virtually non-existent, with characters engaging in aimless conversations that lead nowhere. The character played by Robert Duvall is particularly frustrating, as he repeatedly asks the same questions and receives the same responses. I suspect that the film's mediocre rating is due to viewers feeling obligated to appreciate it because of its esteemed cast. Unfortunately, despite the good performances, the overall product is a complete waste of time. Unlike a steaming pile of waste, which at least implies some level of activity, this film is completely stagnant and uneventful.",
    "SWING! is a significant cinematic achievement because it's one of the few remaining African American-produced and acted films from the 1930s. Many of these films have sadly disintegrated to the point of being unviewable, but this one is in relatively good condition. It's also a unique opportunity to witness many of the gifted African American performers of the era, just after the golden age of the iconic Cotton Club - a time largely forgotten today.\n\nUnfortunately, while the film is historically noteworthy and features some delightful performances, it's also a jumbled mess. The main storyline is very similar to the Hollywood musicals of the era - including a diva who's going to sabotage the show and the surprise unknown who emerges from nowhere to save the day. However, the script is atrocious and occasionally trashy - and perpetuates stereotypes of African America that some might find demeaning. This is because before the plot really gets underway, you're treated to a shiftless loafer who sponges off his hardworking wife (a common stereotype of the time) and when he's caught with a floozy (who, by the way, grossly overacts this role), they have a brawl that resembles a scene from WWE Smackdown! And, one of the women wants to slash the other with a straight razor - a truly trashy scene! Later in the film, when the diva is behaving abysmally, her husband punches her in the face and everyone applauds him! It seems like the film, at times, wants to appeal to the lowest common denominator in the audience, PLUS they can't even do this well - with some of the worst acting I've seen in a very long time.\n\nStill, if you can overlook a subpar production in almost every way (with trashy characters, bad acting and direction, and poor writing), this one might be worth a glance so you can experience excellent singing and tap dancing - as well as to catch a glimpse of forgotten African American culture. Just don't say I didn't warn you about the acting - it's really, really atrocious!",
    "**Movie Review: The Sunshine Boys**\n\n**Rating:** *1/2 out of ****\n\n**Summary:** Neil Simon's comedy \"The Sunshine Boys\" is a disappointment, with a title that is the only ironic moment in the film. The movie equates old age with irrational behavior, and features clumsy, mean-spirited, and galumphing performances.\n\n**Cast:**\n\n* Walter Matthau as an aged vaudeville performer\n* George Burns as his former comedy partner (won a Supporting Oscar)\n\n**Criticisms:**\n\n* The movie gets noisier and less tolerable as it progresses\n* Director Herbert Ross sets up gags poorly, hammering away at belligerent routines that fail to pay off\n* Matthau over-compensates for his role, slouching and hollering excessively\n* The picture looks drab and crawls along at a spiritless pace, losing hope early on",
    "I'm a fan of Goldie Hawn, so when I stumbled upon Protocol at Walmart for $5.50, I decided to give it a try. While the film has its mildly entertaining moments, it fails to gain momentum. Certain scenes, like the prolonged party scene in a bar, feel unnecessary and drag on for too long.\n\nThe movie's climax is particularly off-putting, with a heavy-handed message that leaves a sour taste. I don't appreciate comedies that try to lecture me, especially when they're written by someone who seems stuck in the 1960s. \n\nIn the end, although I'm happy to have another Goldie Hawn film in my collection, I'm not convinced it was worth the price I paid.",
    "\"Protocol\" is a disappointing film that relies heavily on the charisma of its lead actress, Goldie Hawn, and a talented supporting cast. The narrative follows the story of a carefree cocktail waitress who gains unexpected fame after accidentally saving the life of a high-ranking Arab official. Unfortunately, the plot loses momentum midway through the film, and even Hawn's signature charm is unable to salvage the overall production. Unless you are a devoted fan of Goldie Hawn, it is unlikely that this film will be worth seeking out.",
    "In the film industry, an executive producer is responsible for securing the financial resources needed to produce a movie. This person plays a crucial role in getting the project off the ground. In many movies featuring Sean Connery, he is also credited as the executive producer, which means he was instrumental in raising the funds for the film. However, it's worth noting that when a major star like Connery is both the executive producer and the lead actor, it often indicates that the movie was made primarily to showcase their talent, rather than having a strong storyline or screenplay.\n\nThis is evident in the movie PROTOCOL, which stars Goldie Hawn as a cocktail waitress-turned-diplomat who finds herself in increasingly absurd situations. The fact that Hawn is also the executive producer of the film suggests that the story and screenplay may not be the strongest aspects of the movie.",
    "This film's outlandish premise lacks plausibility and fails to deliver laughs or interest. Fortunately, Goldie Hawn's signature charm saves it from complete disaster, allowing it to barely scrape by. It's a testament to Hawn's talent that she's managed to achieve so much in her career despite being given subpar material to work with.",
    "Only two movies have earned a dismal 1/10 from me, and 'Protocol' is one of them - the other being the equally cringe-worthy 'The Man who Fell to Earth.' I still recall the painful experience of watching 'Protocol' in a theater during my high school days in the early 80s. The script is an insult to anyone's intelligence, including that of a high school student. The movie's attempt at humor, particularly the ridiculous gag of someone getting shot in the butt, completely lost me. Goldie Hawn's supposed charm falls flat, coming across as vacuous and moronic instead. To make matters worse, the film perpetuates offensive Arab stereotypes, followed by Hawn's character winning over the crowd with trite, populist nonsense. The acting is atrocious, with Hawn's performance being particularly cringeworthy. It took her impressive turn in 'Everyone Says I Love You' for me to forgive her and give her another chance. 'Protocol' is the epitome of lazy screenplay writing - a complete waste of time and effort.",
    "I have to admit, there's one memorable scene in this movie that still stands out to me - Goldie Hawn looking stunning in her French cut bikini panties, playfully fending off a group of women trying to remove her top. It's a pretty iconic moment! I was only 14 when I first saw it, and it definitely left an impression. Watching it again recently on TV, I was surprised to see that they had blurred out part of the scene - it's amazing how much of an impact it had on me back then. Goldie Hawn was truly a beauty in the '80s, and I can only imagine how fun it must have been to be Kurt Russell, her partner at the time.",
    "I was thrilled to discover the movie El Mar, which features mostly Catalan dialogue, at my local art-house video store. However, my excitement was short-lived after watching it.\n\nWhile the film is well-made and visually stunning, I was disappointed by its violent and disturbing content. The opening scene, which shows children experiencing a traumatic event, is particularly shocking. Although the acting is convincing, I questioned the authenticity of certain scenes, such as a corpse being prepared for burial in the town square.\n\nThe story follows three children who survive the initial incident and grow up to become a nun and two patients at a tuberculosis sanatorium. Unfortunately, the characters' motivations, personalities, and dialogue are often unclear and incoherent.\n\nThe film descends into graphic violence, pain, and bloodshed, making it feel like a sensationalized potboiler. The characters' relationships and personalities are not believable, and the story would have benefited from multiple flashbacks to flesh out their backstories.\n\nAs a result, the movie feels like a bizarre and depressing mix of \"Brother Sun, Sister Moon\" and \"Pulp Fiction.\" If you're interested in a film that's heavy on gore and gloom, then El Mar might be for you. However, I prefer something that doesn't leave me feeling disturbed and in need of a shower to wash off the negativity.\n\nOn a positive note, the movie features the Mallorqui dialect of Catalan, which is distinct from the Barcelona dialect. Interestingly, even native Barcelonans may need subtitles to understand the dialogue.",
    "I was disappointed and furious after watching a Catalan film in the Berlin competition. The film was a waste of time, with too much blood and too many themes that went nowhere. The Spanish Civil War is a horrific topic, but the film's portrayal of revenge, homosexuality, and skepticism towards Catholicism was unoriginal and poorly executed. The film is a pseudo-tragic mess that ranks among the worst in film history. It's a shame to see Angela Molina in this movie. I strongly advise against watching it.",
    "This film was a major disappointment, marred by its relentless cruelty and violence, which was both disturbing and unnecessary. Some scenes were gratuitously ugly and mean-spirited, making it difficult to sympathize with the main characters, who were unrelatable and lacked depth. The lead protagonist, in particular, came across as slimy and unlikable. The film's claustrophobic atmosphere only added to the over-the-top theatrics. Unfortunately, the movie failed to provide any meaningful insight into the Spanish Civil War, and its portrayal of same-sex attraction as a lurid 'horror' was offensive and poorly handled. The DVD's marketing, which targets gay viewers, is particularly misleading. The actors seemed uncomfortable in their roles, as if they were trying to distance themselves from the film's mess. Overall, this film's appeal is limited to those who enjoy watching brutal violence, including the killing of children and pets - a truly disturbing and off-putting experience.",
    "This three-part horror film features a man in a boarded-up house warning viewers not to venture \"out there\" and then presents three separate stories to illustrate why.\n\nThe first story follows a young couple who get into a car accident and encounter two psychopaths. Although it's predictable, it's well-acted, violent, and engaging, making it an enjoyable 15-minute watch.\n\nThe second story is about a man on the run with stolen money whose car breaks down, leading to a series of unfortunate events. Unfortunately, this segment is slow, obvious, and poorly done, making its 30-minute runtime feel too long. The acting is good, but that's not enough to save it.\n\nThe third story is barely a horror tale, focusing on a lonely woman searching for love. It features beautiful set designs, an erotic atmosphere, and a steamy sex scene, but it's predictable and not scary at all. The ending is also disappointing.\n\nOverall, the first story is worth watching, but the other two are skippable. You might as well tune in for the first segment and then turn it off.",
    "Buckle up for a snooze fest! This wannabe hip road movie crashes and burns with its awkward editing style and bizarre camera angles that will leave you yawning. The talented cast is utterly wasted, stuck with a script that's as pretentious as it is cringe-worthy.\n\nBut, amidst the wreckage, there's a silver lining - Lalo Schifrin's phenomenal soundtrack that's guaranteed to get your groove on. And, let's give credit where credit is due, the opening sequence is a real showstopper, bursting with originality and flair.\n\nSo, unless you're desperate for something to watch on a stormy day when you've exhausted all other options, steer clear of this stinker. Trust us, the scathing reviews are well-deserved - it's a total waste of time. But hey, if you're in the mood for a laughably bad movie that's so bad it's good, then go ahead and indulge. Just don't say we didn't warn you!",
    "\"Scorpion Spring\" is a visually stunning film, with breathtaking landscapes captured in exquisite light. The cinematography is undoubtedly its strongest feature. However, the movie's overall quality is more akin to a made-for-TV production.\n\nThe plot is engaging, with plenty of twists and turns to keep viewers on the edge of their seats. Unfortunately, the lack of subtitles and key plot reveals in Spanish may leave non-native speakers feeling lost.\n\nI received this film as a Christmas gift, as part of a family tradition to explore the works of talented actors. Matthew McConaughey's impressive performances in \"A Time to Kill\" and \"The Newton Boys\" led me to want more. However, despite being billed as a McConaughey film, he has a minimal role with only a few lines and limited screen time. Die-hard fans may be disappointed.\n\nOn the other hand, the film's star, Patrick McGaw, shines with his kind and caring character. He would be perfect in a romantic comedy.\n\nFor those seeking McConaughey's best work, I recommend \"A Time to Kill\", \"The Newton Boys\", \"Frailty\", \"How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days\", \"Edtv\", and \"Amistad\". Avoid \"Larger Than Life\" and \"Angels in the Outfield\" unless you're in the mood for a lighthearted kids' film. As for \"Scorpion Spring\", it's an average film that fails to leave a lasting impression.",
    "I've been searching for this rare film, a former \"video nasty\", for a long time. I finally found it on DVD last year. The low-budget movie is set in the Amazon jungle, where tribes live in fear of the devil. The story follows Laura Crawford, a model who is kidnapped by thugs while working in South America. They take her deep into the jungle, where she's held captive by a native who claims to be \"The Devil\". Laura is subjected to various forms of mistreatment until her captors are satisfied. The film also features scenes of maidens being chained up and the devil engaging in gruesome cannibalism. Meanwhile, Peter Weston, a devil hunter, ventures into the jungle to rescue Laura.",
    "As I tick off the remaining Video Nasties on my list, I stumbled upon this dumpster fire of a film. The \"plot\" follows a kidnapped fashion model held for ransom in the jungle by a group of bumbling idiots. A hapless hero is hired to rescue her, armed with a bag of cash and a helicopter piloted by one of the worst actors I've ever seen. The real \"treat\" is the cannibal cult lurking nearby, led by a laughable, naked \"god\" with ping-pong ball eyes and atrocious makeup. His incessant growling and groaning will have you reaching for the mute button.\n\nBut what really earns this film its banned status is the gratuitous nudity - and I mean gratuitous. Jess Franco takes exploitation to new lows with lingering close-ups of female and male genitalia. Even gore fans won't find redemption in the brief, one-second scene of gut-ripping violence. This trash is a waste of time, even for die-hard Video Nasty enthusiasts. Save yourself the agony and leave this one for last - or better yet, skip it altogether.",
    "I'm not sure who's more to blame - those who labeled \"Devil Hunter\" a video nasty or the director himself - but one thing's for sure: this horror movie is downright bizarre.\n\nThe plot is a haphazard mix of superior films like \"Cannibal Ferox\" and \"Cut and Run\". A woman gets kidnapped in a jungle setting that looks suspiciously like a Mexican park, by a tribe of \"savages\" who resemble hippies in Party City Halloween costumes. The tribe's members are a racially diverse group, with Franco seemingly casting anyone who looked even remotely ethnic.\n\nTo make matters worse, the film is severely lacking in gore, scares, and features an excessive amount of unnecessary nudity. It's just not fun. As someone who can usually find something to appreciate in sleazy Italian or Euro-trash films, I was thoroughly disappointed by \"Devil Hunter\". It fell way short of my expectations.\n\nOverall, I'd give it a paltry 2 out of 10.",
    "Get ready for a thrill ride of terror and titillation! This notorious video nasty was initially banned in Britain, but finally unleashed in all its uncut glory last November.\n\nThe film sizzles from the start, featuring the stunning Ursula Buchfellner, Playboy's Playmate of the Month for October 1979. The opening scenes tantalize with a sultry mix of Buchfellner's beauty and eerie jungle landscapes. But let's be real, who needs foggy forests when you have a bathtub scene that's just begging to be the main event?\n\nThe plot thickens as Laura (Buchfellner) is kidnapped and held for ransom in the jungle. Enter Peter (Al Cliver, star of The Beyond and Zombie), the rugged hero sent to rescue her and retrieve the ransom. But things quickly take a dark turn as the kidnappers' true nature is revealed, and Laura finds herself in a desperate fight for survival.\n\nAs the ransom exchange goes horribly wrong, Laura flees into the jungle, pursued by cannibals and other dangers. Will Peter reach her in time, or will she become their next meal? Along the way, he encounters a cast of characters that will leave you breathless, including the seductive Muriel Montossé, who's comfortable in her own skin - and not much else.\n\nWith its graphic violence, full-frontal nudity, and over-the-top action sequences, this film is not for the faint of heart. But if you're ready for a wild ride, buckle up and get ready to experience one of the most notorious video nasties of all time!",
    "Among the three Jess Franco titles that made it onto the Official DPP Video Nasty list, including Devil Hunter, Bloody Moon, and Women Behind Bars, this one is arguably the least deserving of its notorious reputation. It's a dull, jungle-based clunker that's only slightly redeemed by some inept gore, a gratuitous rape scene, and an abundance of nudity.\n\nThe film stars Ursula Buchfellner as Laura Crawford, a beautiful blonde movie star who's kidnapped by a ruthless gang and taken to a remote tropical island. The island is inhabited by a savage tribe that worships a \"devil god\" - a large, naked, bulging-eyed native who feeds on the hearts of young female sacrifices.\n\nLaura's agent hires brave mercenary Peter Weston (Al Cliver) and his Vietnam vet pilot friend to deliver a $6 million ransom. However, things go awry when the kidnappers try to double-cross them. In the chaos, Laura escapes into the jungle, only to fall into the hands of the island's natives, who offer her up to their god.\n\nFranco's direction is as sluggish as ever, and the film is plagued by his usual trademarks: subpar gore, murky cinematography, rapid zooms, excessive crotch shots, out-of-focus imagery, terrible sound effects, and clumsy editing. The result is a mess that's a real struggle to sit through from start to finish. Even the sight of the stunning Buchfellner in all her natural glory isn't enough to make me want to revisit this film anytime soon.",
    "The telltale sign of a truly terrible horror movie? When you can't stop laughing at its absurdity! While other reviewers have already dissected the plot, I'll focus on the unintentionally hilarious aspects that make this film a comedic gem.\n\nOne of the most baffling aspects is the movie's setting, which seems to be a mystery even to the filmmakers themselves. Is it South America, Africa, or a random Pacific island? The cannibal tribe, comprised of a few black women and men, plus a drummer who bears an uncanny resemblance to a young Frank Zappa, only adds to the confusion. And then there's the Devil God, a towering figure with a severe case of pink eye.\n\nOne of the most side-splitting moments occurs when the character Pablito discovers his partner's body hanging from a tree, covered in what appears to be orange blood. Pablito's over-the-top screaming fit, which lasts for minutes, is comedy gold. But the pièce de résistance is when his partner's head falls to the ground, and Pablito kicks it around like a soccer ball, complete with moving eyes. It's a moment that's equal parts disturbing and ridiculous.\n\nOf course, the illusion is shattered when you realize the eyes moved because of the film's overall incompetence. Nevertheless, I haven't laughed this hard in ages, and I highly recommend this movie for a lighthearted Sunday afternoon with friends. Grab some beers, sit back, and enjoy the unintentional hilarity. Just don't expect a genuinely scary or gory horror movie – this one's strictly for laughs.",
    "A film shoot in Africa takes a dark turn when the lead actress is abducted and held for ransom deep in the jungle. The producer hires a rescue team to retrieve her, but their mission is threatened by a tribe of cannibals who worship a grotesque deity with a twisted appetite for naked female victims.\n\nThis exploitation film revels in gratuitous nudity, violence, and brutality, catering to the most prurient interests. However, despite its lurid content, the movie falls flat due to its plodding pace, disjointed plotlines, and minimal dialogue. The few spoken lines are often limited to cruel taunts or defiant declarations, making the film feel eerily silent. The only sounds that punctuate the monotony are the blood-curdling screams of the victims.\n\nUnless you're a die-hard fan of Euro-cannibal horror or in desperate need of a sleep aid, this movie is best avoided. Interestingly, VideoAsia's recent release of the film as part of their Terror Tales series features a letterboxed print, likely sourced from a Japanese version with cropped subtitles, and lacks opening titles.",
    "Get ready for the wildest ride of your life! If you've ever dreamed of seeing Al Cliver take down a 7-foot-tall, naked giant in a full nelson, then this film is the answer to your prayers! The plot is pure gold: a famous actress, Laura Crawford (played by the stunning Ursula Buchfellner), gets kidnapped by a group of baddies who demand a whopping $6 million ransom. But they didn't count on rugged Vietnam vet Peter Weston (Cliver) being hired to rescue her. And things get even crazier when they stumble upon a local tribe that worships a monstrous, bloodshot-eyed cannibal god!\n\nThis film is a total blast, thanks to its hilarious dubbing and the ridiculously awesome monster with ping-pong ball eyes (yes, you read that right!). The cast is packed with EuroCult legends, including Gisela Hahn and Werner Pochath, and the film is filled with nudity, gore, and over-the-top action. The highlight has to be the epic, slow-motion fistfight between Cliver and Antonio de Cabo in the waves - it's pure cinematic gold!\n\nThe only downside is that the film could have been trimmed down to a tighter 80 minutes, but Jess Franco's direction keeps things entertaining despite the lengthy runtime. The Severin DVD looks great, with only a few minor issues with ghosting in the darker scenes. And as a bonus, Franco shares some fun behind-the-scenes stories in a 16-minute interview, where he gushes about working with the lovely Ursula Buchfellner. So grab some popcorn and get ready for a wild, wacky ride!",
    "\"Unleashing the Beast: The Misguided Notoriety of Devil Hunter\"\n\nImagine a film so notorious, it landed on the infamous DPP \"Video Nasty\" list, but for all the wrong reasons. Devil Hunter is a prime example of a movie that shouldn't have been banned, yet its inclusion on the list is what drew me in. I must admit, I only watched it to complete my \"Nasty\" checklist, and I suspect I'm not alone.\n\nDespite its questionable reputation, Devil Hunter boasts a promising premise: an actress is kidnapped and dragged into the Amazon jungle, prompting a hunter to embark on a perilous rescue mission. The twist? The native tribe is led by a man who calls himself \"The Devil.\" Unfortunately, the film's potential is squandered, plodding along for 85 minutes without delivering any truly memorable scenes.\n\nIt's a shame, really, because director Jess Franco has proven his talent in other films like The Diabolical Dr Z, Venus in Furs, Faceless, and She Kills in Ecstasy. Devil Hunter, however, is a lackluster effort, a gem buried beneath a heap of mediocrity.\n\nUnless you're a die-hard \"Nasty\" enthusiast like myself, there's little reason to subject yourself to this underwhelming experience. But if you're curious about the film's notorious reputation, be warned: it's a snooze-fest that fails to deliver on its promise of shock and awe.",
    "This 75-minute film felt overly long, a common issue with jungle horror movies. The excessive footage of characters walking through the jungle, up rocky cliffs, or near bodies of water only serves to pad the running time.\n\nHowever, the film is worth watching for its unintentionally humorous moments, particularly the naked native zombie with bulging, bloody eyes. The heavy breathing and reverb on the soundtrack add to the comedic effect.\n\nEurotrash fans will likely be entertained by the poorly dubbed English dialogue, gratuitous female nudity, and silly makeup jobs on the monster and native extras. Notably, this zombie/cannibal film is relatively light on gore, although it's possible that I didn't see an uncut version.",
    "This movie is a complete disaster, with a ridiculously low budget and terrible acting. The plot is also incredibly silly and nonsensical. The idea of a mystical man who preys on women, regardless of their purity, is just absurd. Unless you have absolutely nothing better to do, like taking a nap, there's no reason to waste your time on this film.",
    "The TMNT franchise has seen better days, and this particular installment is undoubtedly its lowest point. Even as a kid, I was underwhelmed when it first released, despite being a fan of the original animated series.\n\nOne cringe-worthy scene that still stands out in my mind is when the mafia ape character condescendingly explains the concept of rhetorical questions to his underlings. It's a painful moment that has stuck with me. While many fans have criticized the series for introducing a female turtle, I never had an issue with it. In fact, I had completely forgotten about her existence until I recently revisited the show. Overall, it's a disappointingly forgettable experience.\n\nThe one redeeming quality is the catchy theme song, which I admit is a guilty pleasure. The \"Nananana ninja...\" refrain still gets stuck in my head to this day.",
    "Ugh, this is a total travesty when it comes to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Luckily, Venus isn't considered part of the official TMNT canon, so we can just pretend she never existed. I mean, the whole point of the Turtles' story is that they're four unique, male mutants who will never have families of their own - it's a tragic tale that gets lost when you throw a female turtle into the mix. And don't even get me started on the crossover episode with Power Rangers - it was a total disaster. The voice acting was off, the characters were out of character, and the whole thing just felt like a mess. They could've done so much better with the designs, animatronics, and writing. \n\nHonestly, I wouldn't waste my time on this stuff - it's just cringeworthy. The lip movements were slow and unnatural, and they totally disrespected Shredder, the main villain. The dragon lord guy was super cheesy, and the Turtles looked ridiculous with all the extra stuff hanging off their bodies. What's up with the weird thing around Raph's thigh? And those silly, sculpted plastrons? If they had just kept the Turtles looking normal, acting in character, and ditched Venus and the kiddie cartoon sound effects, this could've been decent. But as it stands, it's just a total disappointment.",
    "I've always been a die-hard fan of the original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series from 1987, and the idea of introducing a female turtle named Venus just doesn't resonate with me. The classic quartet of brothers - Leonardo, Michelangelo, Raphael, and Donatello - named after the great artists, is an integral part of the TMNT DNA. Adding a new character disrupts the dynamic that made the show so beloved. The old series was pure magic, with each episode introducing new villains and action-packed storylines. The new series, with Venus, just can't compare. I long for the good old days when the Turtles were the heroes we knew and loved. Give me more of the same, without the unnecessary addition of a female turtle. Let's keep the nostalgia alive and the action pumping with the classic characters we adore!",
    "Warning: Avoid This Cinematic Catastrophe at All Costs!\n\nDon't waste your time reading further - trust us, you won't be missing out on anything. If you're considering watching this disaster, let us spare you the agony: just don't. Unless, of course, you're a film student looking for a masterclass in how not to make a good movie.\n\nThe acting? Abysmal. It's like they raided the local community theater and handed out scripts. We were shocked to discover that the Michael Madsen lookalike was actually the real deal - and even he couldn't elevate this mess. It's a new low, even for him.\n\nThe plot? A jumbled mess of clichés and predictable twists. Anyone who claims it's original or good must have never seen a decent film in their life. Even by the standards of mindless Hollywood action flicks, this one falls flat.\n\nSo, do yourself a favor: skip this trainwreck and go for a jog instead. Your sanity (and your eyes) will thank you.",
    "**Disappointing Experience**\n\nI recently had the misfortune of watching a movie that failed to impress me on multiple levels. Despite my initial enthusiasm, the film's poor acting and weak writing made it a struggle to sit through.\n\nUnfortunately, the movie's shortcomings were further exacerbated by a gratuitous and disturbing rape scene, which added nothing to the plot and only served to detract from the viewing experience. The only redeeming quality was Deniz Akkaya's performance, but even that was overshadowed by the film's overall lack of coherence and believability.\n\nI understand the importance of providing constructive feedback, and I hope that my review will serve as a warning to others who might be considering watching this movie. I also hope that filmmakers will take note of the criticisms and strive to do better in the future.\n\nOn a separate note, I do wish that IMDb's review policy allowed for more concise feedback. Sometimes, a simple warning or thumbs-down is all that's needed to convey a reviewer's sentiments.",
    "Warning: avoid this title at all costs. Unless you're tired of well-crafted movies and want to waste your time on a subpar experience. I walked out of the AFI Dallas screening with 20 minutes left, not because I was trying to be rude to the director, but because I simply didn't care about the plot anymore.\n\nThe red flags started waving just 5 minutes in, with a glaring goof: a shattered window before a single shot was fired. It was a harbinger of the disaster to come. The acting, including Michael Madsen's phoned-in performance, was underwhelming. And the rape scene? Absolutely appalling. The phrase \"shut up and take it\" has no place in any film, let alone a scene as sensitive as that.\n\nOverall, this movie fails on every level. Don't waste your time. 3/10.",
    "Watching a terrible movie can be a demoralizing experience, leaving you wondering how such a low standard is acceptable in our society. It's frustrating to see the same clichés recycled, expecting audiences to remain entertained despite the lack of originality.\n\nThe overreliance on guns as a plot device is a tired trope in Hollywood films. Characters are defined by their possession or lack of a gun, and the narrative revolves around this singular element. The formula is predictable and uninspired, with characters behaving unrealistically and police sirens signaling the conclusion.\n\nTo make this formula work, a film needs to be clever and well-executed. Unfortunately, this movie falls short, lacking life and personality. It's a draining experience that can leave you feeling worse about the world we live in. In my opinion, this is one of the worst films I've ever seen, and those involved in its creation should be held accountable for their contribution to this mediocre and soulless trash.",
    "I'm disappointed in the final product of this film. Edward Furlong, I think you have potential, but this project didn't do you justice. It's clear that the goal was to make a quick profit, rather than creating a quality film.\n\nThe cinematography was subpar, and the acting lacked depth. It's essential to have a talented cast with experience to bring a story to life. Director Jon Keeyes, I think you have room for growth. The camera angles were awkward, the dialogue felt forced, and the music was misplaced. Perhaps you should focus on developing your craft before taking on another project.\n\nInstead of trying to create an action-packed movie, it might have been better to go back to the drawing board and wait for a more promising idea. Alternatively, you could consider exploring other career paths that might be a better fit for your skills. This would not only reduce your stress levels but also spare moviegoers from a disappointing experience.\n\nRating: 1/10 (my first one)",
    "I recently had the misfortune of renting this obscure film on DVD, despite having no prior knowledge of its existence. The presence of Michael Madsen, a seasoned actor, did little to alleviate my initial skepticism. However, I decided to give it a chance, and I must say that I regret doing so.\n\nIt's clear that Mr. Madsen would likely prefer to distance himself from this cinematic embarrassment. The film's script and dialogue are atrocious, and even the most talented actors cannot salvage such a poorly written narrative. Furthermore, the abundance of amateur actors, many of whom are non-native English speakers attempting to portray native English speakers, only adds to the overall sense of amateurishness. The lines delivered are stilted and unconvincing, making it difficult to become invested in the story.\n\nThe soundtrack is equally cringe-worthy, with music that is jarringly out of place. The entire production has the feel of a low-budget school play, lacking the polish and sophistication one expects from a professional film.\n\nWhile I would not recommend wasting your time on this film, it may serve as a useful point of comparison to appreciate the merits of better movies. For this reason, I have given it a rating of 3, although it barely deserves even that.",
    "I stumbled upon a DVD at a friend's house that caught my attention. At first, I thought it was a Turkish action movie featuring some lesser-known Hollywood stars. Curiosity got the better of me, and I decided to give it a shot. Let's just say it was a challenging watch. After the credits rolled, I was left thinking, \"This is an insult to the heist/hostage movie genre.\" But then I did some digging and discovered that the film wasn't Turkish at all - it was actually shot in America with an American director and crew! This revelation left me wondering how they managed to convince big names like Michael Madsen, Edward Furlong, and Arnold Vosloo to join the project. The answer, I assumed, was a hefty paycheck. But then I started thinking about how they could afford to pay these stars and assemble an international cast. The answer, I realized, was by cutting costs on equipment and crew. And if that wasn't enough, the director likely took on multiple roles to stay within budget. Despite its flaws, this movie isn't a complete waste of time. It sparks curiosity, raises questions, and leaves you in a state of disbelief. In a world where many movies fail to evoke any reaction, this one at least gets you thinking.",
    "I was surprised by the large number of Turkish actors in the film, but unfortunately, their talents were wasted due to the poor script. The movie didn't challenge the actors' skills or abilities, and it didn't require much from them. I was particularly disappointed because I'm a fan of Michael Madsen, but even he couldn't elevate this subpar film. The script was weak, and the characters were flat and two-dimensional. Madsen tried to bring some depth to his character, but the script and direction didn't allow it.\n\nThe sound effects were also unimpressive, with the gunfight at the beginning sounding more like paintball guns than real firearms. Even video games have better sound effects than this film. Additionally, there was a annoying character at the beginning of the movie who had a whiny, high-pitched voice that was distracting. On the bright side, the film did have a few unintentionally humorous moments that made me laugh briefly. Overall, it was a disappointing film, but I'm confident that Madsen will bounce back from this misstep.",
    "I just suffered through the most atrocious movie experience of my life! At first, the plot summary seemed decent, but boy was I wrong. The acting was an absolute abomination - it was like the actors were paralyzed with camera fright. Every scene felt like a cringeworthy, fake, and forced attempt at drama. I almost felt sorry for Edward Furlong, who I used to idolize in Terminator 2 (my all-time favorite, which I've watched a whopping 20 times!).\n\nBut the plot? Utter garbage. I'm convinced the writers were running on fumes when they conjured up those laughable lines. It was like they were trying to create a hot mess.\n\nAnd yet... this trainwreck of a movie has a certain charm. It's the kind of so-bad-it's-good flick that you can't help but watch, just to see how much worse it can get. You'll be on the edge of your seat, wondering how the filmmakers managed to botch it so badly. And when it's all over, you'll be eager to share your horror story with friends, just to appreciate the real cinematic masterpieces out there.\n\nSo, do yourself a favor and watch this monstrosity. Trust me, it'll make you appreciate the good stuff even more!",
    "I'm a huge Arnold Vosloo fan, so I was thrilled to finally see him take center stage in a recent movie. It was about time he got the spotlight!\n\nBut, I have to admit, my film appreciation classes in college have made me a bit picky. One thing that bugged me was the setting - it was filmed in an abandoned part of town, which meant zero background noise or curious onlookers. It felt a bit artificial.\n\nThe acting, unfortunately, was a letdown. I think it's because of poor direction and a subpar supporting cast. But Arnold, being the talented actor he is, managed to make the film watchable. Without him, I'd have written it off as just another mediocre movie.\n\nThe rape scene was brutal and felt unnecessary, but the actors who got away at the end did a great job. On the other hand, the sound effects during the shootout were pretty cringeworthy. There were some continuity glitches, but I was willing to overlook them considering the film's overall quality.\n\nAll in all, I enjoyed the movie simply because Arnold Vosloo was in it. He's just that good!",
    "This enigmatic art film, dated either 1969 or 1972 (depending on the source), embodies the essence of its era. The innovative camera techniques and vibrant pop art aesthetic scream late 1960s to early 1970s.\n\nThe film's experimental approach features three core images, manipulated through unconventional camera tricks to create a mesmerizing visual experience. The absence of dialogue and narrative is intentional, allowing the viewer to focus on the synergy between the distorted images and the accompanying music. This avant-garde approach is reminiscent of performance art, challenging traditional notions of storytelling.\n\nWhile the film's uniqueness may captivate some, its abstract nature may not resonate with everyone. However, for those who appreciate experimental cinema and are open to pushing the boundaries of artistic expression, this film offers a fascinating, if not polarizing, experience.",
    "This psychedelic video is way too trippy for me - 9 minutes of weird, pulsing abstract images is enough to drive you nuts! I caught a glimpse of an eye at the beginning and some bird silhouettes later on, but honestly, it just wasn't my thing. Felt like it dragged on for 8½ minutes too long.",
    "This film boasts an impressive array of attractive individuals, which may be its most redeeming quality. In fact, their physical appeal might even justify watching the movie.\n\n\"Loaded\" tells the story of Tristan Price, a young man from a wealthy and reputable family, who is poised to make a significant impact on the world. He is destined for law school, but beneath the surface of his seemingly perfect life, Tristan faces immense pressure and a lack of emotional support from his family. This suffocating environment leads him to engage in extreme behavior when given the opportunity, such as during a celebratory night out at a strip club with friends. There, he meets Sebastian Cole, who introduces him to the world of drug dealing.\n\nDespite its technical proficiency, the film is hindered by a subpar script and an unengaging narrative. Furthermore, the excessive use of camera tricks, including slow-motion, fast-motion, freeze-frames, and echoes, proves distracting and unnecessary. These effects, typically employed to convey a character's drug-induced perspective, are instead used randomly and superficially.\n\nThe cast, comprised of relatively unknown actors, delivers solid performances, with the main antagonist, Corey Large, standing out in particular. It is likely that some of these actors will go on to appear in more prominent and successful projects in the future.\n\nIt is worth noting that the actors' physical attractiveness is a notable aspect of the film. On a scale of physical appeal, the movie scores exceptionally high, with the female characters being particularly stunning. While the male characters are also attractive, this is a subjective assessment best left to individual interpretation.\n\nUltimately, I cannot recommend this film, as it fails to justify the time and effort required to watch it.",
    "* The movie \"Loaded\" is the worst movie ever made, surpassing all others in its horrific quality.\n* The film is so bad that it's not even a movie, but rather an embarrassment to humanity and a distortion of reality.\n* It's a shame that the actors, writers, and director involved in the film can sleep at night knowing they created something so terrible.\n* The movie is not just \"bad\" in a humorous way, but rather it's awkwardly bad, with predictable plot points and overused editing effects.\n* The film's production values are surprisingly high, making its failure even more inexcusable.\n* The movie is a form of torture and should be stopped from being made to prevent harm to society.",
    "There are instances where, upon completing a film, one cannot help but feel a sense of regret for the time invested. Unfortunately, this movie falls into that category. I found myself struggling to persevere, even with only 15 minutes remaining, and in hindsight, I wish I had abandoned it altogether.\n\nThe film's portrayal of a character's rapid descent from a life of discipline and control to one of utter recklessness and irresponsibility is implausible and unconvincing.\n\nThe story follows Tristan Price, a man of privilege and refinement, as he becomes seduced by a woman, violence, and substance abuse. While the allure of the beautiful April, played by Nathalie Kelley, is understandable, Tristan's swift and inexplicable surrender to a life of debauchery and devotion to a stranger is difficult to comprehend.\n\nUltimately, aside from the opportunity to appreciate the talents of Nathalie Kelley and Monica Keena, this film lacks any redeeming qualities. I would advise viewers to conserve their time and resources, and explore alternative entertainment options.",
    "Honestly, this movie was a total letdown. The plot was weak, the violence was predictable, and the characters were only mildly interesting. It felt like the writer, who's also one of the stars, was drawing from their own personal mistakes and adding in some over-the-top fantasies about drugs and murder to try to make it more exciting. But it didn't work.\n\nFrom the clichéd rap and house soundtrack to the family drama, everything about this movie felt like a stereotype. The acting was subpar, and I found myself checking my watch more than once. And can you believe the title has been used not once, not twice, but five times in the past few years? It's like they weren't even trying to be original.\n\nI caught this movie on Showtime, and it wasn't until I was halfway through that I realized it wasn't about an undercover cop - which, let's be real, would've been a pretty predictable twist too. But at least it would've added some interest to an otherwise snooze-fest of a movie.",
    "I didn't like this movie at all. Some people think it's good because it shows how drugs can ruin someone's life, but I didn't find it convincing. The plot was boring, unrealistic, and hard to follow.\n\nThe actors were attractive, but that wasn't enough to make the movie interesting. The action scenes were few and not exciting. This movie is just a waste of time.\n\nIf you want to watch a movie that teaches you about the dangers of drugs, there are better ones out there, like \"Requiem For A Dream\" or \"Trainspotting\". And if you want a funny movie about drugs, try \"Go\" or \"Halfbaked\".\n\nThe only good line in the movie was stolen from another film, \"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\". Overall, I think you should skip this movie and save your time and money.",
    "If you look at Corey Large's information on IMDb, you'll see that there's a movie called \"Reload\" in production (as of June 2008) where he plays a character named Sebastian Cole.\n\nTwo things come to mind: how does a movie as bad as this get a sequel, and didn't Sebastian die at the end of \"Loaded\"?\n\nI watched this movie in the early hours of the morning while struggling with insomnia, so I was in and out of consciousness. I'm sure I missed some plot points, but overall, it seemed weak. Corey Large's performance was one of the stronger aspects of the film, in my opinion. I'm also surprised by all the comments about the beautiful girls, as I thought the actress playing Brooke was pretty, but not exceptional.",
    "This movie had some serious potential, and the plot wasn't half bad. But, man, the actors, director, and editors totally dropped the ball.\n\nI feel for the writers - this could've been a solid flick. Unfortunately, the acting is super stiff, and hardly any of the characters feel real.\n\nIt's like the editor just learned some new tricks and wanted to show them off in every single scene. The quick, flashy cuts are supposed to be deep and symbolic, but they just end up being annoying.\n\nI really wanted to like this movie, and I was hoping for a decent payoff at the end. But nope, it just left me feeling like I'd wasted my time, and the filmmakers had wasted their cash.",
    "Hands down, this is one of the most mind-bogglingly awful films I've ever had the misfortune of watching. It's a Frankenstein's monster of a thriller, cobbled together from every tired trope and cliché in the book - and somehow, it still manages to botch the whole thing.\n\nFrom start to finish, this mess is devoid of a single memorable line or character. The plot, if you can even call it that, feels like an afterthought, and the acting? Let's just say it's a mercy I'm not wasting my breath on it. I'm left scratching my head, wondering how on earth this trainwreck got greenlit and released into the wild. Did nobody, anywhere, at any point, stop and think, 'Hold up, this is utter garbage'? It's cinematic abominations like this that drive people to piracy - at least then you're not wasting your hard-earned cash or precious time. Trust me, spare yourself the agony and avoid this stinker like the plague!",
    "**Movie Review: A Disappointing Experience**\n\nI recently watched this film and was left underwhelmed. Here's my breakdown of the movie:\n\n**Acting: 6/10**\nThe acting was mediocre, with some decent performances but nothing exceptional.\n\n**Direction: 4/10**\nThe director made some questionable decisions that didn't do the film any favors.\n\n**Writing: 2/10**\nThe story was a mess, with a convoluted plot and numerous flaws that made it hard to follow.\n\n**Overall Score: 4/10**\nUnfortunately, I wouldn't recommend wasting your time on this movie. The characters were over-the-top and unrealistic, and the storyline was plagued by unexplainable events. The film's style, which relied heavily on special effects like slow motion, camera shakes, and fast forwards, became boring after just 30 minutes. While the use of music was a positive aspect, there were too many tracks that overwhelmed the dialogue. In fact, the first hour was almost evenly split between dialogue and music.\n\nOverall, this movie was a disappointment, and I might have been too generous with my score of 4.",
    "This movie marks a new low in entertainment, despite there being worse films out there.\n\nIn the gangster/drug scene genre, it's challenging to craft a convincing storyline, and this movie falls short. The motives of characters like Sebastian are unconvincing and rely on overused clichés. The film also fails to establish believable character relationships.\n\nThe story attempts to explore Tristan's rebellion against his upper-class family, but it doesn't delve deep enough. The random flashbacks hint at a more nuanced exploration, but the movie doesn't follow through. Tristan's motivations for his actions are unclear, making it hard to invest in his character.\n\nThis film raises interesting questions about the need for rebellious behavior in privileged families, but it doesn't capitalize on these themes. Instead, it prioritizes flashy production techniques and special effects over character development and a natural, organic storyline.\n\nThe movie tries to pass itself off as a drama that condemns substance abuse and violence, but it ultimately feels like a cheap, run-of-the-mill action film. The cast is average, with Vinnie Jones being the only redeeming factor, albeit barely.\n\nOverall, I cannot recommend this movie. It earns 1 point for Vinnie Jones' performance and 2 points for the editing, but that's about it.",
    "Honestly, from the start of the movie, I got the feeling that the director had a specific vision in mind - but unfortunately, it didn't quite translate to the screen. It's like they had a certain style or tone they wanted to achieve, and then wrote a story to fit around it. Sadly, it didn't work out as planned.\n\nI think the director was going for a stylish, artsy vibe, but it fell flat. To be blunt, I didn't find the movie engaging or worth my time. However, I do have to give the director some credit - they clearly understand the medium they're working with, and at least managed to maintain continuity throughout the film. The actors also delivered decent performances. So while it's not the worst movie I've ever seen, it's still a disappointment.",
    "I have to admit, I didn't exactly watch this movie from start to finish. I just caught the gist of the plot, and to be honest, it didn't really grab me. There were some parts that didn't make sense, and it felt a bit dull at times.\n\nThe only reason I even bothered watching it was because I'm a huge fan of Chace Crawford - he's absolutely gorgeous! Although, I have to say, his hair was a bit weird in this movie. Still, he's definitely easy on the eyes.\n\nDespite Chace's charm, the movie just didn't do it for me. The plot was okay, but what really bugged me was the excessive swearing. Can't people express themselves without using the F-word every other sentence? It got annoying, and the flashy camera work gave me a headache.\n\nAll in all, I found the movie to be a bit of a snooze-fest and over-the-top. But hey, if you're a die-hard fan of one of the cast members (like I am with Chace!), it might be worth a watch. The cast was definitely easy on the eyes - the girls were stunning! But let's be real, Chace is the real star of the show.",
    "In this eerie horror film, Vincent Price stars as a deranged magician who discovers that his unique skills have been stolen by a rival. Seeking revenge, he concocts a series of sinister plots to punish those who have wronged him. However, his elaborate plan ultimately backfires, leading to a thrilling and unexpected conclusion.\n\nAlthough Price's performance is not as strong as some of his other iconic roles, he remains the main draw of this suspenseful thriller. The supporting cast, featuring Patrick O'Neal, Mary Murphy, Eva Gabor, and Jay Novello, adds to the film's intrigue.",
    "I walked into this film with high expectations, but unfortunately, it fell flat. As a huge fan of Pat Barker's gut-wrenching novel 'Union Street', I was disappointed to see the film adaptation sugarcoat the harsh realities that made the book so unforgettable.\n\nThe novel was a masterclass in evoking emotions - it tore my heartstrings apart, leaving me reeling with tears, shock, and anger. The women of Union Street were multidimensional and raw, their stories so vividly told that I couldn't put the book down, no matter how depressing it got. It was a gripping, unflinching portrayal of life in a northern England working-class area.\n\nBut the film? It's a watered-down, feel-good version that loses the essence of the novel. The complex characters are condensed into one, their stories glossed over or discarded. The harsh realities of poverty - the broken windows, the stench, the darkness - are replaced with sunshine, pretty houses, and a saccharine soundtrack. It's a beautiful film, but it's not 'Union Street'.\n\nIf you enjoyed the film's positivity and hope, be warned: the book is a different beast altogether. It's a brutal, unflinching portrayal of reality, more akin to 'Schindler's List' than a heartwarming drama. So, if you're not prepared for a emotional gut-punch, proceed with caution.",
    "I recently came across a capsule review that praised the \"great acting\" in this film. Unfortunately, I couldn't disagree more. In my opinion, two talented actors deliver subpar performances, lacking any discernible chemistry, under the guidance of a usually skilled director who seems to be having an off day. Robert De Niro's character, in particular, is a puzzle, as he appears to be an intuitive and perceptive individual who happens to be illiterate - a curious contradiction. Jane Fonda's portrayal, meanwhile, is all over the place, struggling to find coherence in a poorly written role. The pacing of the film is glacial, making it a chore to watch. Despite its noble intention to inspire with a story of overcoming illiteracy, the end result is a disappointing and uninspiring experience. I would give it a rating of 1 out of 10, making it one of the most underwhelming films I've seen in its budget category.",
    "Robert DeNiro's character is supposed to be some kind of genius, but he's also illiterate - it's just not believable. The whole movie is a waste of talent, and it's honestly pretty disgusting. The script is ridiculous, the dialogue is cringeworthy, and Jane Fonda's character is a lazy, unfunny caricature of herself. The pacing is slow, the cinematography is misguided, and the movie is way too preachy. It's also packed with every cliché in the book. The only bright spot is Swoozie Kurtz's excellent supporting performance, but it's not enough to save this mess. \n\nAnd can I just say, I hate IMDB's new rule that requires 10 lines of text for every review? When a movie is this bad, it doesn't take 10 lines to warn people to avoid it. Trust me, this one's a waste of time and tape - skip it.",
    "This film tells the bizarre story of a man who develops unnatural feelings for a pig. The opening scene is a masterclass in absurd comedy, as a formal orchestra audience is transformed into a violent, chaotic mob by the singers' frenzied chanting. Unfortunately, the absurdity continues throughout the film, lacking a coherent narrative and becoming increasingly off-putting. Even viewers familiar with the era's cinema may find it challenging to engage with. The cryptic dialogue is particularly difficult to follow, making Shakespeare seem simple by comparison. On a technical level, the film is more impressive than expected, with notable cinematography by the future acclaimed director Vilmos Zsigmond. Additionally, future stars Sally Kirkland and Frederic Forrest make brief appearances.",
    "Oh, Bait, you silly thing! Let me count the ways you made me giggle (not in a good way, though). 1. Your jokes are so cheesy, I'm surprised they didn't come with a side of nachos. Predictable and corny, they're more likely to make me roll my eyes than laugh out loud. 2. Your drama is more like a soap opera - over-the-top and totally unbelievable. The \"bad guy\" looks like he belongs in a Microsoft commercial, not a thriller. And Jamie Foxx's dramatic scenes? More like a parody than a serious performance. 3. Your action scenes are a bit of a snooze-fest, and when things get intense, the camera starts shaking like it's having a dance party. I'm not sure what's more dizzying - the action or the cinematography! 4. You tried to be a good movie, Bait, but you ended up being a hot mess. I'd rather watch a marathon of cat videos than sit through your overacting, ridiculous plot, and Bill Gates-esque villain. And don't even get me started on that car explosion scene - it's like you wanted to see how many laws of physics you could break in one go!",
    "I'm not going to pretend to be a movie critic, but I have to say that I was disappointed with this film. As a fan of Takashi Miike, I expected more, but this movie falls into the category of his weaker works. It seems like some people give it a free pass just because it's a Takashi Miike film, but I think that's a superficial approach to cinema.\n\nIn reality, the movie has some major flaws. The main character's constant screaming is annoying and detracts from the film. The pacing is slow, and the acting is subpar. The story lacks originality and character development, and the lead character's transformation in the face of conflict is superficial.\n\nEven though Miike co-wrote the screenplay, his unique personality doesn't shine through on screen. The film had potential, but it was wasted. If you're new to Miike's work, I'd recommend starting with some of his better films like Gozu, Ichi, and Audition, and then exploring his other works like Blue's Harp, Fudoh, Rainy Dog, and Bird People of China.",
    "This lackluster adaptation wastes a talented cast on a visually appealing but emotionally flat retelling. The dialogue feels rehearsed rather than genuine, and the underwhelming ghostly appearances fail to evoke any sense of wonder. Edward Woodward's Ghost of Christmas Present is more caricature than character, awkwardly teetering on stilts and channeling Bernard Cribbins. George C. Scott's Scrooge is too cynical, never fully committing to the role, which dilutes the impact of his performance. The flashbacks to his past are as uninspiring as flipping through a photo album, lacking any real emotional resonance. The rest of the cast seems phoned in, except for Frank Finlay, who overacts to compensate. Overall, this adaptation falls flat due to uninspired direction and a general lack of effort.",
    "I was thrilled to watch the movie adaptation of the book I had just finished reading, and my 13-year-old son was equally eager. We settled in to enjoy a beloved holiday classic come to life on screen. However, my excitement was short-lived.\n\nThe film deviated from the book far too many times, which was unacceptable. Although George C. Scott is a talented actor, he only seemed fully invested in his character about 20% of the time, coming across as flat the rest of the time.\n\nConsidering the movie was made in 1984, before the widespread use of CGI effects, I was willing to be lenient. Nevertheless, the production quality was subpar, particularly the scene with Jacob Marley, which looked like it belonged in a B-movie.\n\nThe biggest letdown was the omission of a poignant scene from the book, where the Spirit of Christmas Present takes Scrooge on a global tour, showcasing people in dire circumstances still finding joy and love during Christmas.\n\nOn a positive note, George C. Scott did a great job portraying the reformed Scrooge towards the end. His performance was refreshing and well-done.\n\nI also felt that Bob Cratchit should have been depicted as more downtrodden and ragged. And as for Tiny Tim, the child actor's performance was unfortunately subpar.",
    "I've had the pleasure of watching multiple adaptations of this beloved film, and unfortunately, this particular version didn't quite resonate with me. I think the main reason is that Scott's portrayal of Scrooge felt a bit flat and lacked the emotional depth I've come to expect from this iconic character. Alistair Sim's performance in the classic version still stands out to me as a benchmark for this role. While Scott's delivery was adequate, it didn't convey the same level of conviction and transformation that I've seen in other adaptations. That being said, I do appreciate the effort that went into making this film, and I'm sure it will still find its audience. Perhaps with a bit more nuance and character development, it could have reached its full potential.",
    "I was shocked by how poorly made the movie adaptation of Charles Dickens' classic short story was when we watched it in my English class today. While George C. Scott shone as Scrooge, the rest of the cast's subpar performances were cringe-worthy. The over-the-top acting and repetitive lines, such as \"Merry Christmas to everyone!\", had me giggling uncontrollably at times, but I also found myself struggling to stay awake.\n\nThe story follows a wealthy miser who dismisses Christmas as mere humbug, until three ghosts visit him and convince him to change his ways. Despite its promising premise, the movie's script is surprisingly weak, feeling like it was hastily written in just a few minutes.\n\nI'm baffled by the high ratings this movie has received. If you're looking for a truly enjoyable holiday film, I'd recommend the Bill Murray comedy Scrooged instead. At least that one knows how to bring the laughs!",
    "Ugh, can we please just put an end to the Christmas Carol remakes already? I'm so over seeing the same old story rehashed time and time again. It's like every filmmaker thinks they can outdo the last one, but honestly, it's just not that great of a story. It's all about being super moralistic, old-fashioned, and conservative, with a side of forced happiness. And the worst part? It's like we're not even learning from our mistakes. I mean, how many versions of this movie do we need to prove that we're just not getting it?",
    "I was at my friend's camping trailer last night, excited to watch a new episode of South Park. Since it didn't air until 10:30 PM, we decided to pass the time by watching Father of the Pride, which was currently on. I had only seen two episodes of the show before, and the first time I watched it, I didn't find it funny and thought it was crude for no reason. However, I gave it another chance last night. My impression was that it's a copycat of The Simpsons, but with lions instead of humans. I was surprised it had a TV-14 rating, as I think The Simpsons is more vulgar and violent. The only offensive content in Father of the Pride was some unfunny gay jokes. Although the show's creator also directed Shrek 2, which I loved, I think they stuck too closely to a family-friendly theme. That being said, Father of the Pride did make me laugh a few times. Overall, I don't love or hate the show, but I've seen better from The Simpsons. I'd give it a rating of 3.5 out of 10.",
    "This film is an unapologetic, futuristic retelling of Jules Verne's classic \"Mysterious Island\". Unfortunately, the sound editing is subpar, with dialogue that sounds like it was recorded on set and in a recording booth simultaneously. The amateurish production, featuring actors from Boston and shot on location in New Hampshire, is riddled with flaws. At times, you can even hear the director's voice giving instructions to the actors, which adds to the film's DIY feel.\n\nThe characters are equally bizarre, with one who communicates telepathically and a blue alien with a deep voice. However, the alien's voice is inconsistent, often slipping into the actor's natural tone during grunts and yawns. The special effects, courtesy of Brett Piper's early work, are imaginative but marred by jerky animation reminiscent of Karl Zeman's style in \"Journey to the Beginning of Time\" (1955).\n\nDespite its technical shortcomings, the film's music is a redeeming quality. It's essential to note that \"Mysterious Planet\" was essentially a home movie made on a shoestring budget. As such, it's a fascinating case study for aspiring filmmakers, offering a glimpse into the challenges and limitations of low-budget filmmaking. While it may not hold a candle to the likes of \"Equinox\" or \"Planet of the Dinosaurs\", let alone a Ray Harryhausen epic, \"Mysterious Planet\" is a must-watch for its sheer audacity and DIY spirit.",
    "It is unequivocally evident that \"Mysterious Planet\" is one of the most inferior films ever produced, yet it holds a certain sentimental value for me due to its inadvertent comedic appeal. The impoverished special effects and astonishingly poor soundtrack, particularly within the first 15 minutes (which, frankly, is all that is necessary to witness), converge to create a hilariously entertaining experience.\n\nThe inaugural scene, set in \"space,\" is a cinematographic anomaly, featuring washing-up liquid bottles whizzing past the viewer's eyes accompanied by muffled dialogue. Before one can even process the absurdity of the scene, the credits roll, and the narrative struggles to gain momentum.\n\nFurthermore, the film boasts the added peculiarity of featuring both the original actors' voices and dubbed voices simultaneously, including the memorable appearance of a double-headed, plasticine giant snail that terrorizes the protagonists. This anomaly can only be described as pure genius.\n\nRegrettably, for aficionados of such cinematic fare, I have only ever encountered a single copy of this film, making it highly unlikely that others will have the opportunity to experience it. It is possible that I possess the only existing copy of \"Mysterious Planet.\"",
    "Imagine walking into a pet shop and being greeted by none other than Betty, a faded star of the past. She's trying to make a comeback, but it's clear her best days are behind her. Thanks to the strict Production Code, her spark has been dimmed. As she leaves you in the care of Henry, dubbed \"the world's funniest human\" (though it's hard to see why), you can't help but feel a sense of boredom wash over you. Five long minutes tick by as Henry tries to entertain, but it's just not happening. This little cartoon is a snooze-fest.",
    "William Russ plays the lead role in this made-for-TV movie, which follows his character as he abandons his family and later returns to pay off his debts, while trying to keep his distance. Peter Falk, known for his iconic role as Columbo, appears in multiple roles, attempting to persuade Russ's character to reunite with his family.\n\nThe story is mediocre, and while the film effectively utilizes Falk's talents, Russ is not a household name. Despite this, his acting skills are still passable.\n\nUnfortunately, the movie's delivery and plot are overly predictable and cheesy. The final 20 minutes are particularly formulaic, making it easy to anticipate the outcome. A good movie should be unpredictable and engaging, which this one fails to achieve.\n\nOverall, this movie falls short, earning a disappointing grade of \"D\".",
    "\"Finding John Christmas\" is a disappointing holiday film with a convoluted plot, bad dialogue, and disjointed scenes. The acting is subpar, even from seasoned actors like Peter Falk. The script by Michael J. Murray is juvenile and lacks depth. The performances from the entire cast, including Valerie Bertinelli, William Russ, and David Cubitt, are unemotional and lackluster.\n\nInstead of wasting your time on this film, I recommend searching for classic and inspirational holiday movies like \"Miracle on 34th Street\", \"The Shop Around the Corner\", \"It's a Wonderful Life\", and \"Meet John Doe\". Even more modern films like \"Home Alone\" and \"Home for the Holidays\" are better options. Take my advice and skip \"Finding John Christmas\" this holiday season.",
    "I rarely bother to remark on an exceptional film, but when it comes to a terrible movie, I feel compelled to criticize it harshly. Speaking of Vivah, this director, Sooraj Badjatya, appears to have utterly lost his touch. Following the success of Hum Aapke Hain Kaun, he seemed to think he could profit from producing trite wedding videos. Vivah is so ridiculously sentimental that the Badjatyas have surpassed the Johars and Chopras in terms of melodrama.\n\nThere wasn't a single moment during the movie where I could say, 'Oh, at least this aspect is decent.' Alok Nath resorts to clichés in his role as the girl's father, Shahid Kapoor looks bloated and lacks charisma, Amrita Rao is another disappointment, adding to the ugly scenery, poor costumes, predictable plot, over-the-top stepmother, struggling actors, jarring background music, and cheap soundtracks.\n\nNow, the spoiler alert: I'm warning you all that, as is the case with all his other movies, after a disastrous event, the film concludes on a cheerful note.",
    "While I wouldn't categorize this film as entirely unsuccessful, it failed to meet my expectations. In comparison to the superior \"Hum Aapke Hain Kaun,\" this movie felt outdated and lacked a compelling narrative. Throughout the film, I anticipated a surprising twist, but instead, the plot unfolded predictably, with the protagonist overcoming her aunt's disapproval.\n\nOne of the most striking aspects of the movie was the overly cautious behavior of the engaged couple, who required permission for every minor decision. Their excessive shyness, even after multiple encounters, was also unconvincing. I had expected the aunt to be a more formidable antagonist, but her character was reduced to mere complaining.\n\nThe film's portrayal of family life felt idealized and unrealistic, with a perfect family, a cruel aunt, and a devoted partner. The casting of Anupam Kher and Mohnish Behl, familiar faces from \"Hum Aapke Hain Kaun,\" only served to highlight the shortcomings of this movie. Ultimately, I felt that my time was not well spent, and I would rate this film 2/10.",
    "Get ready to be swept away by a fairy tale romance that's as sweet as cotton candy, but just as unrealistic. This grown-up Cinderella story is a dreamy, over-the-top, love-struck fantasy that will leave you rolling your eyes in disbelief. Shahid Kapoor is the only redeeming quality, but even he can't save this sugary sweet mess from its own absurdity. Unless you're a hopeless romantic living in a fantasy world, I'd advise you to save your three hours and stick to reality. The rest of us will be over here, scratching our heads and wondering how this film managed to outshine a classic like HDDCS!",
    "After being thoroughly captivated by Pierce Brosnan's charismatic performance as a cad in \"The Tailor of Panama\" - a film that excelled in every aspect, from casting to emotional impact - I eagerly looked forward to this movie. Unfortunately, my high expectations were brutally crushed. What I got was a lackluster script reading masquerading as a film, relying on gratuitous vulgarity rather than substance. In stark contrast to the rich, satisfying experience of \"The Tailor of Panama\", this film fell flat in every way. The blame lies squarely on the shoulders of the screenwriter and director. I sat in the theater, waiting in vain for a redeeming moment that never arrived. The film failed to evoke even a single genuine laugh or tear, with only one fleeting line of dialogue managing to elicit a faint smile. Was it worth the $7 ticket price? Not by a long shot.",
    "I was tempted to walk out of the theater, but I had already paid for my ticket and my equally disgusted friend wanted to see it through. After the charming innocence of \"A New Hope\" and the sophisticated thrills of \"The Empire Strikes Back,\" I had eagerly anticipated \"Return of the Jedi.\" However, from the opening scene, I was bitterly disappointed and outraged by the blatant commercialism that permeated the entire film.\n\nIt was clear that George Lucas had prioritized profit over artistic integrity, cramming the movie with as many licensable action figures as possible. The film was a two-hour commercial, featuring an array of marketable characters, including the pig-like guards, the flesh-pigtailed flunky, Jabba's vile muppet-pet, and the Ewoks. The Rebel Alliance aliens were also given brief screen time, no doubt to encourage children to buy their corresponding action figures.\n\nLucas didn't even bother to create a new plot, instead rehashing the Death Star from \"A New Hope\" and adding cheap sentiment. This was a slap in the face to his fans, and I couldn't help but feel that Lucas took pleasure in inflicting this subpar film on them.\n\nWhile Harrison Ford managed to deliver a decent performance, it was overshadowed by the overwhelming commercialism that dominated the film. Any redeeming moments were vastly outweighed by Lucas's shameless pursuit of profit, making \"Return of the Jedi\" a total sell-out.",
    "This lackluster story about a secretary murdered by her married lover can't be saved by its talented cast. The problem is, this one-sided tale of romance and murder raises more questions than it answers - and since we only get the prosecution's side, we're left with a lot of unanswered questions. This kind of fare tends to appeal to the 'man-haters' out there. As presented, it's a simplistic tale of an innocent woman who just happens to be caught up in an affair with a high-powered, married attorney. You can't help but wonder: if she hadn't been cheating on her boyfriend and sleeping with a married man, could this whole tragic mess have been avoided? Don't worry about pausing to grab a snack while watching - you won't miss a thing.",
    "I was thoroughly disappointed with this film, which I found to be disjointed, illogical, and contrived. What's more, it presented a disturbingly misogynistic portrayal of women. I rented it expecting a comedy, but it was a far cry from that. The cover promised an outstanding performance from Andie McDowell, but unfortunately, that wasn't the case. I watched it with two friends, and we all agreed that it was a complete disaster.\n\n**Spoiler Alert!**\n\nThe movie's plot is predictable and clichéd, revolving around an older woman who falls for a younger man, much to the dismay of her two single friends. They try to convince her to marry a dull, older man who has feelings for her, but she chooses the younger guy instead. However, her friends concoct a scheme to make her think he's cheating, leading to a fight and his eventual death in a tragic accident. To make matters worse, the protagonist, a school headmistress, is pregnant and decides to marry the boring guy, who happens to be a minister. She had previously asked him to marry the younger man, but now she settles for him without any apparent qualms. Just as the wedding is about to take place, her friends intervene and whisk her away. In the final scene, they're shown to be callous and smug, leaving the baby unattended in a crib while they indulge in drinks and cigarettes on the porch. I've omitted some of the more ridiculous aspects of the film, including a cancer subplot and a gratuitous lesbian moment.",
    "This film is a blatant attempt to capitalize on the success of Sex and the City and Four Weddings and a Funeral. In fact, it might have performed better at the box office if it had been titled Sex at a Funeral.\n\nUnfortunately, the film fails to find its footing, stuck between two genres and unable to recover. The characters deliver witty dialogue, but their actions are unrealistic and unrelatable. The plot is a series of arbitrary and senseless events that quickly become tiresome.\n\nAndie MacDowell deserves credit for her enthusiastic performance, but Imelda Staunton steals the show as a police detective (despite being an unlikely fit for the role). Staunton's acting is flawless, unlike the writer-director's efforts.\n\nIf you found Notting Hill to be pretentious, you'll want to avoid this film. It's a shallow imitation, lacking in authenticity.",
    "This film was a disaster. The scene where Kate arrives and Jed is surrounded by clapping guys felt like a clichéd Hollywood moment. Another cringe-worthy scene featured Kate examining the pavement texture, which came across as awkward. Andie's acting was subpar, making it impossible for me to connect with her character or believe in her romance. The other two female leads, however, shone in their roles. The movie's campiness and implausible situations didn't help, and Andie's acting only made it worse. Her overemphasis on her gums was also distracting. It's ironic that she looks glamorous in Lancome commercials, but not in this film.",
    "Get ready for a trainwreck! This disaster starts off on the wrong foot with three women behaving like immature, giggling schoolgirls, indulging in gin, cigarettes, and a silly caramel chocolate challenge. But buckle up, folks, because it's about to take a nosedive! Andie's character, the headmistress of an English school (yes, you read that right!), falls for her former 14-year-old student, now a young organ player. But before you can even process that, her toxic \"friend\" ruins everything! And if you thought it couldn't get any worse, Andie's character forgives her so-called friend, has the organ player's baby, and the three women end up right back where they started - guzzling gin and puffing on cigarettes like there's no tomorrow. The cherry on top? Andie's character dramatically tosses the caramel chocolates into the street, attempting to symbolize growth, but really just coming off as laughable. Mercy, indeed!",
    "This film was a disaster. Andie Macdowell's acting was atrocious, making her seem as wooden as a rocking horse. It's a shame, considering her cringe-worthy performance in Four Weddings. This movie perpetuates the cliché of England being filled with quaint chocolate box cottages and idyllic village greens. The school depicted in the film is equally unrealistic, resembling something out of a fantasy like Hogwarts. The police station looked like it belonged in the cheesy British series Heartbeat.\n\nThe film's biggest problem is its inability to decide what it wants to be - a comedy or a serious exploration of women's friendships. If it had stuck to comedy, the graveyard sex scenes and the absurd wedding storming might have worked. But these scenes clashed terribly with the tragic second half. It's also implausible that Kate would forgive Molly's terrible behavior and speak to her again.\n\nI'm left wondering what talented actresses like Imelda Staunton and Anna Chancellor are doing in this mess. Andie Macdowell should probably stick to advertising wrinkle cream, where her limited acting skills might be more suitable.",
    "I caught this movie on IFC yesterday and was shocked by the positive reviews. Did I miss something? The characters portrayed as \"ladies\" were anything but. Take Kate, for instance, who claims she's a pillar of the community yet sleeps with Jed. Then, they suddenly declare their love for each other? It's even more ridiculous that she's supposedly devastated by his death, yet doesn't attend his funeral or share the \"good news\" with his family. And what's with an American becoming the headmistress of a prestigious British school?\n\nJanine's abuse of power as a cop is inexcusable, but she faces no consequences. Instead, she ends up sleeping with a con she brought in for questioning. As for Molly, the less said, the better. The guilt Janine and Molly supposedly feel over Jed's death is laughable. He's responsible for his own demise, after all. Where's the remorse for poor Gerald, who gets puked on? I wish I could express my frustration to the people behind this mess of a movie!",
    "At first, I was misled - I thought this film was set in the bustling streets of New York, but instead, it's a charming tale nestled in the British countryside. And while I expected a light-hearted comedy, I was surprised to find a poignant drama that tugs at the heartstrings.\n\nWhile the film takes an unexpected turn in its final act, becoming slightly far-fetched, the performances of the three lead actresses are undeniably captivating. The tall doctor and the redhead policewoman bring a unique energy to their roles, but it's McDowell who truly shines with her signature gentle, soft-spoken demeanor. Her ability to convey depth and emotion with subtlety is a testament to her remarkable talent.\n\nWhat truly sets this film apart, however, is its refreshing feminine perspective. The three women, each with their own distinct personality and approach to life, offer a nuanced exploration of singlehood and the complexities of human experience. The film's thoughtful portrayal of their individual viewpoints is a powerful reminder of the importance of empathy and understanding.\n\nWhile the film's conclusion may not entirely satisfy, the journey itself is engaging and well worth the watch. With its strong performances, unique perspective, and thought-provoking themes, this movie is a hidden gem that will linger in your mind long after the credits roll.",
    "So, was this movie supposed to be a comedy or a drama? It starts off pretty lighthearted with three women chatting and joking around. Okay, cool. Then things take a turn when one of them meets a guy and they start to clash. Alright, still following. There are some silly moments, but then the plot gets dark and I'm like, \"Wait, did I misread this whole movie?\" It stays pretty heavy for a bit, and then tries to go back to being lighthearted at the end. But by that point, it's too late. It's hard to believe these women would still be friends, and the ending feels fake. Honestly, it's a great example of how not to make a movie (especially if you're from the UK!). I have no idea how the producers thought this would work out. And clearly, it didn't - I'd never even heard of this movie until now, four years after it came out. It totally bombed at the box office!",
    "Let's talk about Andie McDowell's latest movie. She plays a 40-something woman who starts dating a much younger guy, which causes a rift with her two closest friends. \n\nThose friends are convinced that the young guy is just a gold-digger, and they go all out to \"help\" Andie's character see the truth. But honestly, their efforts are just over-the-top and ridiculous. \n\nThe movie has some pretty unbelievable scenes that are just too far-fetched. If they had toned those down, this could've been a sweet love story. Instead, you'll find yourself shaking your head, thinking \"this just doesn't happen in real life!\" \n\nSo, if you're thinking of watching this movie, don't get your hopes up. I was really disappointed, and I'd only give it a 4 out of 10. There are way better movies out there, and this one just isn't worth your time.",
    "**SPOILER ALERT**\n\nIn a surprising twist, Jed, the young lover, is mistakenly accused of infidelity by Kate (Andie McDowell), who believes he's having an affair with one of her friends. Convinced she's caught them in the act, Kate throws Jed's shoes out the door, and he reluctantly leaves. As he sits in the middle of the road to put on his shoes, tragedy strikes - he's hit by a truck and killed.\n\nIt's hard to imagine a screenwriter pitching a script with such a dramatic plot turn. Up until then, the film attempts to be a lighthearted comedy, but it falls flat. The characters, except for Jed, are annoying and unlikable. The sudden shift in tone, from comedy to tragedy, is jarring. However, the film eventually takes a more uplifting turn, as the women learn to support and love each other, rather than tearing each other down. Overall, I'd give it 2 thumbs down.",
    "Oh, Crush is just a total delight - said no one ever. But seriously, the worst part about this movie isn't that the acting is subpar, the plot is nonexistent, or that the camerawork is mediocre. Nope, it's that it teases you with a few genuinely amazing moments, just to dash your hopes and leave you feeling disappointed.\n\nIf you're into sappy violin music and clichéd scenes of middle-aged women sobbing, hugging, and talking about babies and marriage, then Crush is the movie for you! But if you're like me and prefer not to roll your eyes into oblivion, then you might want to skip it. The few decent jokes aren't enough to redeem the rest of the mess.\n\nMy verdict? 4/10. Crush is guilty of wasting my time, and I'd rather stick needles in my eyes than watch it again.",
    "This film is not a celebration of women, but rather a misguided attempt at appealing to a general audience. Unfortunately, it's one of the worst films about women directed by a man. Director Andy McKay's lack of understanding of women is glaringly apparent. The movie is marred by poor taste, relying on crude humor reminiscent of American Pie, and features a nonsensical, baseless storyline with unconvincing characters. The film's vulgar fantasies are cringeworthy and insulting, rather than humorous. It's surprising that three talented actresses agreed to participate in this project.",
    "I'm still fuming after watching this film, which I can only describe as a cringeworthy, condescending disaster. As a single woman over 40, I felt personally insulted by this lazy, stereotypical portrayal of women of all ages. It's clear that the male writer-director was out of his depth, churning out a shallow, unconvincing 'chick flick' that fails on every level. Andie McDowell, an actress who deserves better, was given a non-existent plot to work with, leaving her characters as flat as the film's overall tone. There's no character development, no emotional resonance, and no attempt to make the story even remotely believable. And don't even get me started on the tired, male-gaze fantasy of a straight woman suddenly 'trying out' lesbianism - it's a cliché that's as offensive as it is predictable. I'm not just asking for my DVD rental money back; I want those 112 minutes of my life back, too. What a complete waste of time.",
    "I was initially excited about this movie because of its promising premise, which revolves around the friendship of three women being disrupted by one of them falling in love with a younger man. However, the film failed to deliver. The characters are portrayed as exaggerated caricatures, lacking support for one another and instead plotting against each other. The talented actresses, Anna Chancellor and Imelda Staunton, were given a poor script and struggled to balance the tone between slapstick and screwball comedy, which didn't work well given their characters' professional backgrounds in a small town. The movie wasted its potential by focusing on the women's complaints about their lack of romantic and sexual fulfillment, rather than exploring more substantial themes. The lesbian subplot was also underdeveloped, and the portrayal of the women's smoking and drinking habits was unrealistic. Overall, I was disappointed by this wasted opportunity and would give it a rating of 4 out of 10.",
    "\"Love in Full Bloom: A Charming, Yet Imperfect Rom-Com\"\n\nImagine a delightful, 40-something friends' romantic escapade, à la British \"Sex and the City,\" and you'll get \"The Crush.\" The film's first two-thirds are a breezy, feel-good ride, with a dash of wit and charm.\n\nOne of the standout elements is the transformation of the handsome young beau, played by the talented Kenny Doughty. It's a shame we don't get to see more of him – in every sense! The age gap between the young hunk and the older woman is surprisingly prominent, unlike in other films like \"Sabrina\" or even real-life celebrity pairings.\n\nThe supporting cast, featuring familiar faces from British dramas and comedies, adds to the film's appeal. Andie MacDowell shines as an expat, surrounded by a talented ensemble, including the sharp-tongued Anna Chancellor.\n\nHowever, the plot takes an unexpected turn towards the end, feeling a bit contrived. But it wasn't until the credits rolled that I realized the true issue: the writer-director, Scot John McKay, might have been better suited to pen a script about three gay men navigating love and identity. The original working title, \"The Sad F*cker's Club,\" hints at a more intriguing, \"Broken Hearts Club\"-esque story.\n\nOriginally written in 2002, \"The Crush\" remains a pleasant, if imperfect, romantic comedy.",
    "This movie had potential, but it failed to deliver. Instead of exploring a lesbian relationship in depth, it only scratched the surface. The plot is predictable and unoriginal, and the filmmakers relied on the resemblance of the two lead actresses to the Russian group t.A.T.u. to generate interest. The supporting cast, which includes well-known Romanian celebrities who aren't even actors, seems unnecessary. The movie's formula is straightforward: take a \"girl band\" concept, add some desperate publicity stunts, a non-existent plot, and excessive bad language to shock audiences. Unfortunately, the result is a disappointing film that wastes a good idea. And the title 'Love Sick' is equally unimpressive.",
    "**Light Spoiler Alert!**\n\nI was really excited to see this movie, especially since I loved the novel. I was hoping for a deep and intense film that would explore some interesting human relationships. And yeah, the script and director tried to make that happen... but unfortunately, the main cast just didn't deliver.\n\nMaria's acting was super dry and lacked any real emotion. Even in the most intense scenes, she seemed kinda comical. It was like she was nervous in front of the camera or something. The only time she really showed some feeling was near the end when her girlfriend dumps her.\n\nIoana was even more awkward than Maria, and she didn't seem natural at all. Maria at least had some attitude, even if it was a bit forced. But Ioana's character was just kinda... there. We didn't get to learn much about her or her relationship with Maria. It was like, \"Oh, they're just a couple now.\" And her only really touching scene was when she broke up with Maria.\n\nThe only person who really impressed me was Tudor. He nailed his character's attitude and was believable most of the time. The landlady was also amazing! And Puya was great in his small role.\n\nI loved the story, and Tudor and the landlady were highlights, but unfortunately, that wasn't enough to save the movie. It's a shame, because the setting had so much potential, and it would've been awesome to see a Romanian movie tackle this theme.\n\nWeirdly, the creepy relationship between the brother and sister seemed more believable than the lesbian relationship between Maria and Ioana. I'm kinda bummed I spent money on a ticket - I would've rather watched it from my couch!",
    "This film relies on sensational and provocative themes like incest and lesbianism to grab attention, but beneath the surface, it's a hollow and uninspired effort. The dialogue is cringe-worthy, and the \"intimate\" scenes lack any real sensuality. The acting and script are better suited for a high school production, yet the subject matter is intended for adults. The result is a spineless and shallow movie that fails to deliver. It's a wasted opportunity that could have been elevated with a compelling story and more dramatic depth. The overuse of inner monologues only adds to the film's cheap feel. Overall, this movie is an embarrassment to Romanian cinema and a disappointment for mature audiences. While budget constraints can be a challenge, they're no excuse for a film that falls flat. It's time to cast talented actors, rather than relying on musicians like Tudor Chirila, who can't act their way out of a paper bag.",
    "Upon reflection, I found that the film \"Love Sick\" did not resonate with me as I had anticipated. The movie effectively conveyed the intense, frustrating, and jealous nature of the triangular relationship between Alex, Kiki, and Sandu. Ultimately, Alex came to the realization that their relationship was doomed and lacked a future, culminating in a sorrowful conclusion.\n\nI had the opportunity to attend a screening of the film at AMC theatre on Sunday, August 10, 2006, at 12:00 PM, where director Tudor Giurgiu was present. Following the movie, he shared with the audience that his intention was to explore the complexities of sexual relationships in Romania.\n\nFrom my perspective, sexual relationships are inherently complicated, and I did not find the film to be particularly impactful. The romantic developments between Alex and Kiki, as well as Kiki and her brother Sandu, seemed like a familiar, everyday narrative.\n\nI have two primary criticisms of the movie. Firstly, the film failed to provide a clear explanation of how Alex and Kiki fell in love. It appeared that their relationship began after Alex moved into Kiki's building, but the progression of their emotions was unclear. Secondly, the film lacked a scene depicting Alex and Kiki's intimate encounter, which was a pivotal aspect I was expecting to see.\n\nDespite these shortcomings, there were some redeeming qualities to the film. The \"ear piercing\" scene, where Alex willingly endured pain to demonstrate their love for Kiki, was a poignant moment that provided insight into their relationship. Additionally, the scene where they lay in a soccer field, engaging in a heartfelt and passionate conversation, was a notable highlight.",
    "I didn't resonate with Love Sick as much as I thought I would. The film's portrayal of the intense, frustrating, and jealousy-fueled love triangle between Alex, Kiki, and Sandu was captivating, but ultimately, it ended on a sorrowful note. Alex finally came to her senses and realized that their tumultuous relationships were doomed from the start.\n\nI had the opportunity to watch the film with director Tudor Giurgiu at the AMC theatre, and he shared his vision of exploring the complexities of Romanian sexual relationships. However, I didn't find the film's depiction of sexual life to be particularly remarkable or impactful. The love stories of Alex and Kiki, and Kiki and her brother Sandu, felt like familiar, everyday tales.\n\nI had two major issues with the movie. Firstly, it didn't provide a convincing backstory for how Alex and Kiki fell in love. It seemed like they just magically fell for each other after Alex moved into Kiki's building. The film's fragmented narrative left too many gaps for my imagination to fill. Secondly, I was disappointed that the film didn't show a single scene of Alex and Kiki's intimate encounter, which was what I was eagerly waiting for.\n\nDespite these shortcomings, there were some redeeming moments. The ear-piercing scene, where Alex willingly endured pain to prove her love for Kiki, was a poignant and touching moment.

    "I was really looking forward to this movie, especially after all the hype surrounding its release. Unfortunately, it didn't quite live up to my expectations. From the opening scene, I was hoping for something that would grab my attention, but sadly, it didn't deliver. The acting was subpar, with a few exceptions, and the plot didn't have any memorable moments. I think the themes of incest and lesbianism had a lot of potential, but they weren't explored in depth. It's a shame, because I think the movie could have been so much more. Even the most curious viewers won't find anything particularly interesting or redeeming. I wish I could say otherwise, but I think it's a movie that's best avoided. Maybe you'll have a different experience, though - go ahead and watch it for yourself!",
    "This film had the potential to be a compelling watch, boasting a complex love story and intriguing narrative. Unfortunately, the execution falls short. The cinematography is inconsistent, veering wildly between peculiar and adequate, with a tendency to feel claustrophobic and myopic. The sound design is lacking, a common issue in Romanian cinema, and the lighting and color palette are often misjudged. The soundtrack is woefully brief and fails to enhance the on-screen action. As for the performances, the standout is undoubtedly the landlady, while the rest of the cast struggles to deliver convincing portrayals, often coming across as immature and inconsistent in their approach. The acting veers jarringly between overly poetic and awkwardly realistic, undermining the film's overall impact. Ultimately, this is a film aimed at adults, but told with a juvenile sensibility. Only the most curious viewers may find it worth their time.",
    "In contrast to the superficiality of \"Breakdance,\" Stan Lathan's \"Beat Street\" presents a more nuanced and realistic portrayal, albeit one that ultimately succumbs to monotony. While this film capitalizes on the fleeting popularity of the breakdancing phenomenon, it at least offers a modicum of entertainment through its narrative, which explores the lives of three young friends and their younger brother as they navigate adolescence in Queens, New York. Each character possesses a unique talent: one is a hustler, another a DJ, a third an artist specializing in \"burners,\" and the youngest, Lee, is a skilled hip-hop dancer.\n\nRegrettably, Lathan fails to generate genuine audience engagement with the story, and his young cast struggles to bring depth to their characters. As a result, the film relies heavily on its funky soundtrack and impressive dance sequences to salvage what would otherwise be a lackluster experience.\n\nThe choreography is indeed sharp, particularly in the club and street scenes, but this alone is insufficient to elevate \"Beat Street\" to greater heights. Unfortunately, the film's promise of interest is ultimately unfulfilled, leaving the viewer with a sense of disappointment.\n\nSunday, August 25, 1996 - Video",
    "This movie is a boring, poorly acted drama about high school kids obsessed with hip-hop, breakdancing, and graffiti. The characters are unlikable and bland, and their law-breaking antics (like defacing public property and stealing electricity) are portrayed as cool. The non-stop hip-hop music is mediocre and overwhelming. A few imaginative dance numbers are the only redeeming qualities. If you're a hip-hop fan, you might enjoy it, but if you're looking for a good drama, skip it. Also, the PG rating is questionable given the excessive swearing.",
    "\"Unmasking the Truth: Why Beat Street Falls Short of Original Hip Hop Culture\"\n\nWhen it comes to authentic Hip Hop, Wild Style and Style Wars are the real deal. Beat Street, on the other hand, may boast an impressive lineup of early Hip Hop legends, but it's clear they were trying to capitalize on their big break. The result? An overproduced, Hollywood-ized version of Hip Hop that lacks the raw grittiness of life in the ghetto.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the music and dancing in Beat Street are undeniably infectious, which is why it's garnered mostly positive reviews. But for me, the story, acting, dialogue, and direction are all subpar. And let's be real, the electro beats just don't cut it. I was thrilled when a new wave of classic Hip Hop artists emerged in '86, including Krs One, Public Enemy, and Ultramagnetic Mc's, who brought a fresh, authentic sound to the table.\n\nIn contrast, Wild Style may not have a complex narrative, but its music is genuine and captivating. At the end of the day, it's all about personal taste, but for me, Beat Street falls short, earning a mediocre 4 out of 10. If you want to experience the real essence of Hip Hop, look no further than Wild Style and Style Wars.",
    "Upon the introduction of Chachi to the Happy Days cast, I found myself utterly disenchanted, which led me to anticipate a similar disappointment with this film. Unfortunately, my expectations were met, with the most memorable scene being a skateboard chase featuring Scott Baio. Jodie Foster, in her inaugural \"adult\" role, delivers a characteristically polished performance, but it is insufficient to redeem this lackluster production. The two hours I invested in this film are irretrievable, and I was thoroughly underwhelmed by the unengaging characters, implausible narrative, questionable editing, and subpar cinematography. Most egregiously, I found myself completely apathetic towards the storyline, which revolves around the miserable lives of California teenagers in the 1970s and their incompetent parents. I would strongly advise against wasting one's time on this aesthetically unpleasing and narratively deficient film.",
    "This lackluster film attempts to capitalize on the Ramones' iconic status, but ultimately falls flat. The tired 1970s/80s comedy formula, where a group of cool kids concoct a whimsical plan to take over their school, is uninspired and predictable. The plot revolves around a Ramones-obsessed teenager and a school's rebellion against its oppressive administration, but the execution is subpar. If you're in the mood for an entertaining B-movie, I'd recommend Wild Zero starring Guitar Wolf instead. Unfortunately, this film is marred by poor acting, weak writing, and a convoluted plot. It's puzzling why the Ramones lent their name to this project, unless they were in dire need of a quick paycheck. Overall, this movie is a disappointment and not worth your time.",
    "Imagine sitting through a grueling 90-minute Ramones concert, punctuated by cringe-worthy moments of absurdity and mind-numbing dullness. The setting is a bizarre high school that defies all logic. Unless you're a die-hard Ramones fanatic, trust me when I say that wasting your time on this disaster is a monumental mistake. From start to finish, this movie is an unwatchable trainwreck. It's as if the filmmakers were afflicted with 'Ramone Fever,' where everyone inexplicably worships the band. But don't expect a coherent plot to salvage this mess - it's nonexistent. As a teen comedy, this one ranks at the very bottom of the barrel, a laughable attempt at humor that falls flat.",
    "I reluctantly gave this film 2 stars, solely due to Dominic Monaghan's commendable acting effort. Unfortunately, the rest of the film falls short in every aspect. The direction is poorly executed, and it's clear that the filmmaker could benefit from refining their craft and studying the work of others. The casting of Monaghan, a credible actor, in this subpar film does him a disservice. The actor who played Jack's best friend, however, was miscast and lacked the necessary talent. Given the film's low budget, I didn't have high expectations, but I did hope for more attention to character development and setting. Sadly, this film fails to deliver. I would advise against wasting your time and money on it, as you'll likely be disappointed.",
    "I leapt at the opportunity to watch this film in its uncut and uninterrupted glory, fueled by the rave reviews and enthusiastic buzz surrounding it. But just as it seemed poised to deliver some genuine scares, it pulled back and veered off in a different direction. The eerie atmosphere, complete with dripping water, black rain, and prophetic dreams, was abandoned before it could reach its full potential.\n\nWhat a crushing letdown. Richard Chamberlain's stoic expression only added to my growing sense of confusion and disbelief as the movie dragged on. The Aboriginal chanting and instrumentation, which could have been unsettling and otherworldly, was instead a jarring cacophony that felt like a heavy-handed attempt to bludgeon me into submission. The fascinating concepts, such as the idea that modern individuals can embody ancient gods, were presented in a dry, list-like fashion, rather than being woven into the narrative to create a sense of depth and mystery.\n\n[SPOILER] The final scene left me scratching my head, wondering what the director was trying to convey. Was it a massive wave? So what? Was it a tsunami? Okay, that's devastating, but not exactly apocalyptic. Was it the end of the world? From a wave? The last wave? That would require a truly monumental wave. And why? Was the world really that bad a place? It didn't seem so terrible in this movie. In fact, I wasn't even convinced that the wave was real, given the shadow on Burton's face that seemed to suggest otherwise. Was it just Burton's personal apocalypse? That's a daily occurrence for people who lose their grip on reality. If that was the case, it was hardly compelling.\n\nThe one scene that truly sent shivers down my spine was in Charlie's apartment, where Burton confronts the old man for terrorizing his wife. Charlie's repetitive questioning of \"Who are you?\" becomes deeply unsettling, and it's a testament to Weir's potential as a filmmaker. Unfortunately, the rest of the movie failed to live up to that standard.",
    "In a botched attempt at the perfect murder, a wife (Mary Ellen Trainor) kills her husband with a poker, only to be interrupted by an unexpected visitor - a deranged escapee dressed as Santa Claus (Larry Drake). As she fights for her life, she must also find a way to conceal her husband's body. In a desperate bid to frame the Santa killer for the crime, she uses an ax to take him down. However, the killer retaliates by locking her in a closet and pursuing her daughter. The wife must now frantically try to escape and save her child from the clutches of the madman.\n\nThis episode of Tales from the Crypt relies on overused tropes, including the \"Santa kills\" theme and the clichéd plot of a woman murdering her husband for a lover. The story follows a predictable path, with the wife struggling to avoid detection while keeping a safe distance from the killer. Unfortunately, this episode lacks originality and fails to bring anything new or refreshing to the table, making it one of the show's weaker installments.",
    "The cinematic experience I recently endured was akin to aural torture, with a monotony that rivaled the most soporific of sounds. I am still perplexed as to how I managed to stay awake throughout the entire 3.5-hour ordeal. The narrative is straightforward, yet painfully dull, revolving around three unengaging characters who engage in gratuitous discussions about sex for an interminable period. Even the most ardent fans of Eric Rohmer's works may find this film to be an exercise in tedium. It's a testament to my endurance that I was able to sit through the entire movie without succumbing to frustration or, indeed, utter despair.",
    "Iberia looks great on TV, but is it worth watching on the big screen? If you're a fan of classical music or modern dance, this could be a great date movie for you. The film features plenty of impressive dance and music performances. However, if you're not particularly interested in these genres, the one-and-a-half-hour runtime might feel too long. To be honest, if you want to see skilled dancing on the big screen, you might be better off watching a Bollywood movie - they know how to combine breathtaking dance sequences with engaging storytelling. Director Carlos Saura's experience shines through in his cinematography, and there are some truly stunning moments. But when a movie is over an hour long, it should be interesting for most of the time. Unfortunately, not every art form is larger than life, and this film doesn't quite live up to that standard.",
    "It's astonishing that critics have praised this film, given its numerous shortcomings. The narrative is a jumbled mess, the characters are one-dimensional and lack depth, and Michael Bowen's character spends most of the movie misinterpreting those around him. Not a single character possesses a redeeming quality or any semblance of intrigue. This film is neither edgy, imaginative, ironic, nor clever. In fact, it's a tedious, convoluted work that fails to engage on any level. It's no surprise that it was initially overlooked for a theatrical release, and its airing on \"This Network\" only serves to diminish the platform's credibility. I strongly advise against wasting your time on this disaster, instead opting for a rerun of PBS's informative \"Garden Smart\" or a reputable documentary. If you stumble upon it during the day, take a long, refreshing walk – even in smoggy conditions, you'll feel better for having avoided this cinematic catastrophe. Life is too short to be squandered on such a lengthy, unfulfilling experience.",
    "I just suffered through one of the most painful movie experiences of my life. The script was cringe-worthy, the direction was clumsy, and the ending was completely baffling. To make matters worse, the performances were subpar, with the exception of Clancy Brown and Michael Pollard, who deserved so much better than this mess.\n\nWatching this movie felt like doing penance - like I was earning my stripes to eventually deserve a good film. But honestly, it was a chore from start to finish.\n\nThe story tried to pass off a father and son duo who looked like they belonged to different families. The male lead's character was poorly written and lacked any charm or charisma. The plot twists were predictable and felt like they were ripped straight from a bad 90s action flick. And don't even get me started on the female lead and her cop brother - their actions made no sense whatsoever. The climax of the movie was especially frustrating, with a major plot point that defied all logic. It was like the scriptwriters just gave up and phoned it in.",
    "It is nothing short of astonishing to behold the cinematic debacle that Burt Kennedy, a director once renowned for his exceptional skill, has managed to create. This lackluster film is a testament to the director's decline, with its threadbare production values and blatant lack of originality. The battle scenes, which are undoubtedly the most crucial aspect of any war film, are shamelessly lifted from the 1955 classic \"The Last Command,\" a movie that, despite being 32 years older, boasts a more contemporary aesthetic than this sorry excuse for a film. The few action sequences that were actually shot specifically for this movie are a jumbled mess, replete with confusion, incompetence, and a general air of shoddiness that permeates every frame. The overall production has the amateurish feel of a poorly made student film, with a budget that appears to have been woefully inadequate. The pacing is glacial, the acting is either over-the-top or woefully underwhelming, with the notable exception of Raul Julia, who manages to rise above the rest of the cast. Furthermore, the film is replete with historical inaccuracies that are sure to annoy even the most casual viewer. To make matters worse, the film's excessive length of three hours ensures that the viewer is subjected to a prolonged and agonizing experience. If one is intent on creating a dull film, it would be prudent to keep it brief and mercifully end the suffering within an hour or so. Instead, this film chooses to drag on interminably, making it a chore to sit through. For a genuinely engaging film about the Alamo, one would be better off watching John Wayne's 1960 masterpiece or, indeed, the 1955 film from which this movie so brazenly borrowed its action scenes. It is a wonder that it took no less than six producers to create a film of such unmitigated awfulness. In short, this movie is a waste of time and should be avoided at all costs.",
    "I've got to say, this movie is a total misfire - and I'm not just talking about the cannons! As a James Arness western, it's not bad, but as an Alamo film, it's hands-down the worst one out there. The story is a mess, riddled with inaccuracies and outright lies. And don't even get me started on the continuity - it's like they threw it out the window! Did anyone else catch that crazy cannon sequence? I mean, come on, the Mexicans are firing cannons with mud and ramrods still stuck in them? It's ridiculous! And then there's Brian Keith's hat - what was the costumer thinking? Were they on vacation or just having a laugh?",
    "This movie falls short in many ways. Like many others, it prioritizes the mythology of the Alamo over its actual history. The production quality is subpar, giving the impression that it was a project designed to keep a large cast of actors employed, rather than a genuine attempt to tell a compelling story. The biggest issue for me was the miscasting of the main characters, with a group of older TV actors failing to convincingly portray the real-life figures of the Alamo. As a native Texan, I'm familiar with both the mythology and history of the Alamo, and I believe a good production can be made from either perspective. Unfortunately, this movie failed to deliver, lacking the energy and excitement of even John Wayne's or Fess Parker's versions, which were only slightly more accurate. Overall, I was very disappointed and would advise others to avoid it.",
    "Despite its slow pace and occasional inaccuracies, this made-for-TV account of the legendary siege of the Alamo remains a compelling and fascinating portrayal of a pivotal moment in the Texas fight for independence from Mexico. The all-star cast brings the iconic figures of the Alamo to life, including James Arness as the rugged Jim Bowie, Brian Keith as the charismatic Davy Crockett, Alec Baldwin as the courageous Col. Travis, and Raul Julia as the ruthless General Santa Anna. Supported by a talented ensemble cast, including David Ogden Stiers, Kathleen York, and Jim Metzler, this production is elevated by Peter Bernstein's stirring original score. While not without its flaws, this dramatization of the Alamo's heroic last stand is still an engaging and memorable watch.",
    "I was thoroughly disappointed with 'The Alamo: Thirteen Days to Glory', a film that falls short in several areas. The acting is subpar, and the overly patriotic tone can be off-putting. Furthermore, the film's historical accuracy is questionable, and historians may find several inaccuracies. While it does have some redeeming moments, they are not enough to sustain interest throughout its overly lengthy runtime. Overall, I would give this film a rating of * out of **********.",
    "Norman Maclean's story is a true masterpiece, but unfortunately, the film adaptation by Redford falls a bit short. Some scenes, like the Maclean brothers going over the falls and their double date in a seedy bar, feel like they were added unnecessarily and don't quite fit with the original story. Brad Pitt's portrayal of Paul Maclean, a charismatic outdoorsman, doesn't quite live up to the character's genius. However, the fly casting scenes are truly breathtaking! Tom Skerritt and Craig Sheffer shine as the father and Norman, bringing a strong, masculine presence to their roles. It's a shame the women in the film don't get to make as much of an impact, as Maclean's story celebrates their importance in a beautiful, poetic way.",
    "This film's sole redeeming quality is its breathtaking cinematography. Unfortunately, the rest of the movie is a tedious, overlong slog. The minister's failure to practice what he preaches is glaring, especially considering his son Paul's wayward path. The constant profanity from the characters, particularly from a Presbyterian background, feels jarringly out of place. I would have preferred it if Paul's character had met an untimely demise early on, sparing us from his insufferable, self-centered narrative. Instead, we're stuck with Norm's uninspired teaching career and Paul's compulsive gambling, which Norm half-heartedly tries to rescue him from. The only mildly engaging aspect is Paul's confrontation with racist whites over his Native American love interest, which had the potential to be a compelling 'wild western' tale. Unfortunately, it's overshadowed by the dull, sleepy town setting, where the two minister's sons are stuck in a rut, with Norm chasing a lackluster romance and Paul spinning silly yarns at the local newspaper office. I'd rather watch a fishing documentary than sit through this underwhelming film again – and that's exactly what I'll do: never watch it again.",
    "Honestly, I wouldn't want to live in Montana, especially not back in the late 1800s. But, I have to say, \"A River Runs Through It\" is a beautifully shot movie. The landscapes are stunning, and Robert Redford delivers a great performance.\n\nUnfortunately, the story falls flat. I felt bad for the narrator, who's just as dull and narrow-minded as his preacher father. He's stuck in a rut, watching his brother waste away in their small town, and he can't even begin to understand what makes his brother tick. The narrator's so serious all the time, and he knows it - he's aware that he's missing out on the fun in life. The only thing that brings him joy is fly-fishing, which he does in the same old-fashioned way his dad taught him.\n\nThe ending is predictable from the get-go, and overall, I wouldn't recommend this movie (I'd give it a 3 out of 10).",
    "In my opinion, a good film requires a engaging plot, but this particular movie fell short in that department. The lack of a plot made it feel dragging and overly long, despite its relatively short runtime of 123 minutes. I was surprised to find myself checking my watch, eager for it to end. Another major issue was the absence of a significant conflict, which made the story feel flat and uneventful. While it's not the worst film I've seen, it's certainly not memorable. I'm not someone who only enjoys action-packed movies, but this film's slow pace and lack of excitement made it a chore to watch. The only redeeming qualities were the beautiful scenery and costumes, but they weren't enough to save the movie from its overall dullness.",
    "This cinematic endeavor boasts breathtaking vistas, a true feast for the eyes. Regrettably, it falls woefully short in terms of narrative substance, a crucial element that is glaringly absent. A fundamental principle of storytelling is the presence of conflict, which serves as the driving force behind the plot. Unfortunately, this film neglects to incorporate this essential component, leaving the viewer with a meandering, aimless experience. The movie's two-hour runtime is spent lavishly painting a picturesque backdrop, but it fails to inject any semblance of action or tension into the narrative, rendering it a hollow, unengaging experience. While the filmmakers' aspirations to create an artistic masterpiece are evident, they have neglected to attend to the basic tenets of storytelling, resulting in a disappointing and unfulfilling watch.\n\nHowever, if you are enamored with the majestic landscapes of Montana and the serene art of fly fishing, you may find some redeeming value in this film. Just be sure to temper your expectations, as a compelling storyline is sadly lacking.",
    "This movie is a stunning visual masterpiece, transporting viewers to the breathtaking landscapes of Montana. Rather than relying on a traditional narrative, the film takes a more contemplative approach, inviting the audience to immerse themselves in the serene beauty of nature. The absence of conflict allows for a more meditative experience, perfect for those seeking a calming escape from the stresses of everyday life.\n\nWhile some may find the lack of plot unengaging, fans of Montana's natural splendor and fly fishing will appreciate the film's attention to detail and authenticity. The cinematography is a work of art, capturing the essence of the great outdoors in a way that's both soothing and inspiring. If you're looking for a cinematic experience that prioritizes atmosphere over action, this film is a must-see.",
    "I'm afraid I dozed off with 10 minutes to go, which is basically the cinematic equivalent of a strong hint. Let's just say I was more invested in my nap than the plot's climax. Needless to say, it earned a solid 1 from me - and that's being generous!",

A Mountie urging the good people of Dawson City, Yukon to elect their own marshal and take the law into their own hands? Gunfights erupting on the streets as outlaws battle for control of the town? It's a Wild West fantasy that's as far-fetched as it gets!\n\nNewsflash: this isn't Deadwood, folks! This is the Canadian North during the Klondike gold rush, and it's a far cry from the lawless frontier towns of the American West. So, Canadian viewers, buckle up for a hilariously inaccurate ride that's either laugh-out-loud entertaining or cringe-worthy - take your pick!",
    "This action Western, set in the scenic Northwest, boasts an all-star cast led by James Stewart. The film's cinematography is stunning, capturing the region's natural beauty in great detail. The costumes are also impressive, adding to the movie's overall authenticity. The story follows Stewart's character, a wealthy cattleman, as he clashes with a corrupt government in the old Northwest.\n\nWhile the film has its strengths, the protagonist's character is a drawback. He embodies the stereotypical cynical hero often seen in Hollywood films, with few redeeming qualities. His kindness towards his two partners adds some depth to his character, but his pigheadedness towards others makes it difficult to sympathize with him.\n\nFortunately, the supporting cast, including Walter Brennan, Royal Dano, and Harry Morgan, brings the film to life and makes it worth watching.",
    "Warning: this sequel is a catastrophic failure that will leave you questioning the very fabric of the film industry. The senseless killing spree continues, but this time, the victims are the cast and crew of a movie based on the events of the first film.

You'll be left wondering what possessed the director to greenlight such a project, and you'll be tempted to ask the person sitting next to you if they're as baffled as you are.

    "I'm still reeling from the horror movie I watched on Channel 5 yesterday - \"Return to Cabin by the Lake\". It airs every day at 2:00 a.m., featuring a lineup of horror movies from the 70's to early 2000's. Unfortunately, this sequel was a complete disaster.\n\nThe original \"Cabin by the Lake\" was a low-budget but well-received film. However, this follow-up attempt is a mess. It's not even unintentionally funny, and its poor imitation of the original only adds to its downfall. The plot is downright stupid, and the movie's absurd dialogue, cinematography, and direction make it feel like a soap opera at times.\n\nMy advice? Avoid \"Return to Cabin by the Lake\" at all costs. It's a waste of time, even for those who enjoy mediocre filmmaking. Trust me, you won't be missing out on anything. Consider yourself warned!",
    "The sequel to the original film stretches credibility to an extreme degree, as the sociopathic Stanley Kaldwell returns, this time infiltrating the movie production of the novel he wrote about the garden drownings. He assumes the identity of a second unit director he murdered, making for a diabolical plot twist.\n\nThe film pokes fun at Hollywood, using a tongue-in-cheek script to satirize tyrannical directors who sleep with their actresses to get ahead and despise anyone who challenges their spotlight. Brian Krause's over-the-top portrayal of a loud, temperamental director feels forced, but the film's dark humor shines when it explores the idea of a serial killer operating as a movie director. Andrew Moxham plays Paul Parsons, the brother of a victim from the first film, while Nelson effortlessly slips back into his psycho role as Stanley, who uses his intelligence to commandeer the film production and eliminate anyone who stands in his way.\n\nThe film's satire is further amplified by the character of Alison, an ambitious writer played by Dahlia Salem, who wants to understand what drives Stanley to kill. The irony of Alison working with the very man she's trying to understand is a clever touch. The inevitable showdown between Alison and Stanley leads to a conclusion that's hard to swallow, but the film's dark comedy thriller tone makes it an entertaining ride.\n\nHowever, unlike the first film, which was polished and sophisticated, director Po-Chih Leong's use of unnecessary techniques such as weird angles, slow-motion, and video captures detracts from the film's overall impact. Overall, this sequel falls short of the original, with less effective humor and a more obvious tone.",
    "\"Return to Cabin by the Lake\" was disappointing due to its low budget, which resulted in inconsistent camera quality. The film switches between professional-grade shots and low-quality video camera footage within the same scene, creating an awkward blend. \n\nIf you've seen the original \"Cabin by the Lake\", it's worth watching to compare the two. However, if you haven't seen the original, I'd advise against watching this one first, as its cheesiness may deter you from wanting to see the original.",
    "This made-for-TV movie has its limitations, but I'll take that into account in my review. The script is subpar, but it does manage to be mildly humorous at times. The acting is mostly over-the-top, a common issue in lower-budget films.\n\nMy main gripe is the inconsistent filming style. About 90-95% of the movie is shot on film, but there are random 5-10 second segments shot on video. The difference is jarring, with less contrast, duller colors, and a 30fps frame rate instead of the usual 24fps. It's disorienting and makes the film look cheaper than it needs to.\n\nWhile I've seen worse movies, I didn't enjoy this one and wouldn't recommend it.",
    "Don't waste your time on this movie. It's a complete waste of time and I regret watching it. There are too many things wrong with it to even bother critiquing. Trust me, you'll regret seeing it too. Avoid it at all costs.",
    "I stumbled upon this on the Science Fiction network. It aired immediately after the initial installment. For some unknown reason, this film managed to captivate me. I'm not sure why, so stop inquiring.\n\n---SPOILERS--- Alright... It was ridiculous how this individual became entangled in the production of the movie. In the first film, he had a \"motivation\" to commit murder, but in this sequel, half of the killings/attempts were essentially without justification. Stanley eliminated the director due to artistic disagreements, he abducted the co-writer due to creative disputes, but what was the logic behind attempting to eliminate the cast? No cast, no film. He wanted it to \"appear authentic when they died\"? If this was supposed to be a high-budget production, utilize the special effects, for goodness' sake! Of course, similar to the first one, the captive girl escapes, and Stanley ends up getting harmed and vanishes. Wow (sarcastic tone). This movie HAD promise. And the most disheartening aspect of all... the truly disheartening part... I would watch a \"Cabin by the Lake 3\". Only because I'm a fan of Judd Nelson, and he's the sole redeeming quality of this sequel.",
    "I caught Cabin by the Lake on USA this afternoon and found it engaging enough to warrant watching the sequel later that evening. However, I was thoroughly let down by the follow-up film. While I didn't have high expectations, I was taken aback by the jarring use of digital video, which seemed to appear out of nowhere and disrupted the viewing experience. The movie might have been passable without these awkward digital shots, but they only added to the confusion. Moreover, the plot failed to provide a logical explanation for their inclusion. (SPOILER ALERT!) Unlike the first film's open ending, which was acceptable, the sequel's conclusion was ridiculous. Unless it's airing at an obscure time slot, like 4 am against infomercials, I doubt Return to Cabin by the Lake will hold anyone's attention.",
    "While this sequel shows promise, it ultimately fails to deliver the same impact as its predecessor. Judd Nelson stars as a ruthless screenwriter who assumes new identities to bring his novel, CABIN BY THE LAKE, to life. Although the film still boasts its share of brutal killings, it adopts a tongue-in-cheek approach that falls flat. Unfortunately, the humor is more cringe-worthy than laugh-out-loud funny. The entire production feels rushed and Nelson's performance often veers into over-the-top territory. Ironically, the movie's plot revolves around a script being rewritten before hitting the big screen - a process that would have greatly benefited this script itself.",
    "The sequel, Return to Cabin by the Lake, falls woefully short of its predecessor. With only Stanley reprising his role, the movie fails to justify its two-hour runtime. As a huge fan of the original, I was disappointed by the lackluster storyline and subpar acting. This film is a regrettable watch, reminiscent of the underwhelming sequels to Urban Legends and Blair Witch, but with even more cringe-worthy performances. The acting is so atrocious that it's almost laughable, rivaling the melodrama of daytime soap operas. I strongly advise against wasting your time on this movie, as it only serves to tarnish the memory of the first film.",
    "I was disappointed to find that Hedy Burress, who survived the first installment, did not appear in the sequel. I think it would have been more effective to have her character meet a demise similar to what happened in Friday the 13th Part 2. \n\nThe movie's approach, which involved a film within a film, was reminiscent of Scream 3 and Urban Legend 2. Unfortunately, this concept fell flat and the entire movie was a complete waste of time. I would strongly advise against watching it.",
    "It appears that some viewers have been overly enthusiastic in their praise for this film, including its title sequence. However, I must respectfully disagree with their assessment. In my opinion, this movie is a cinematic misfire of epic proportions. If you are not laughing at its absurdity within the first five minutes, I would suggest that you may have lost your sense of humor.\n\nThe film tells the story of a doomed RAF pilot, played by David Niven, who engages in an emotional conversation with a female air traffic controller just as he is about to meet his demise. Miraculously, he survives and washes up on the beach, where he encounters the same air traffic controller, and they promptly fall into each other's arms.\n\nBeyond the film's bizarre and overtly homoerotic undertones, the most striking aspect of the movie is its reliance on national and racial stereotypes in an attempt to make a point about the universal power of love. The film's portrayal of these stereotypes is convoluted and misguided, suggesting that all it takes is a display of emotional vulnerability to elevate the movie to a level of nobility.\n\nThe production quality of the film is also subpar. The continuity and editing are poor, and the lighting is equally unimpressive. However, these flaws are overshadowed by the script's numerous shortcomings. The film's use of Technicolor, foreshadowing, and freeze-motion is awkward and often laughable. The early beach scenes are the most visually appealing, but the rest of the film is a downward spiral.\n\nIn conclusion, while the movie's inadvertent humor may be its only redeeming quality, I would caution against feeling obligated to watch it. Overall, the film is a disappointing and poorly executed attempt at cinematic storytelling."
