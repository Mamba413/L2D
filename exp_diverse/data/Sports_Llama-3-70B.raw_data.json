    "While the Fennoscandian model of the 19th century is often credited with influencing modern ski bindings, it's fascinating to explore the diverse and innovative approaches to ski design that emerged simultaneously in other regions. In East Siberia, for instance, skiers used a unique thin board with a vertical four-hole binding, sometimes even adding a layer of fur for extra grip. Meanwhile, the Lapps developed a horizontal stem-hole binding that would later inspire the design of present-day cross-country skis. By recognizing the contributions of these lesser-known ski cultures, we can gain a deeper appreciation for the rich and varied history of skiing.",

    "In this game, players use their hands to control the ball, but they can only move it forward by passing or dribbling (bouncing the ball on the floor). Once a player stops dribbling, they cannot start again. Instead, they must pass the ball to a teammate or attempt a shot. If a player tries to run with the ball without dribbling, it's considered a \"travelling\" violation, resulting in the other team gaining possession. Additionally, both the ball and the player holding it must stay within the court boundaries during play. If a player steps out of bounds or touches the line with their foot while holding the ball, the opposing team will be awarded possession."
