    "Yeah, sorry for not writing for a whole there, but I've had a pretty busy weekend so far. I found out I have about 20 tests on Tuesday because my teachers are evil...but oh well. We had marching yesterday. It was cool. We stayed inside the whole time, and I got to play second part, so the music part will be really easy. I left early from marching at around 5:00, then went out to dinner with my friends (I made the plans before I knew about marching). So, dinner was fun. It was Kelly's birthday, so it was cool. Then we went to Kel's for a sleepover, and did bunches of neat stuff, and I went to sleep earlier than usual for a sleepover since I had to be at a Bar Mitzvah this morning. It was pretty neat. I have to do this project for CR, and we have to go to two different places of worship than our own. So, one is obviously a Jewish synagogue, and I think I'm going to go to a mosque for my other one, but who knows...so, this has been my only chance to write, and I actually have to go now, so I'll write more later...maybe.  *Ya di amore*",
    "Yeah, so today was ok, late arrival. I'm not in the mood to write much, so..I probably will end up writing a ton. I always end up doing that when I say I don't want to write much. Nothing interesting happened in any of my classes, and I only talked with a couple of good people including, \"You know who\"...except, you don't know who, \"You know who,\" is. Oh well, no one reads this thing anyway. I made it to the top of the rock climbing wall today. Kelly and I intend to conquer the whole wall. It'll be fun. Jazz was good fun as always...heh, and that's really it. Have a lovely evening everyone, and I am off to sleepyland. (I actually didn't write a lot. I'm shocked.)  *Ya di Amore*",
    "Thought- OK...so, I'm all for midgets and whatnot. I'm not all, \"down with midgets,\" but really, don't you think it'd be rude to say, \"Up with midgets?\"  ~Ya di amore~",
    "Yeah, so it's later. My parents found something constructive for me to do...clean. Grrr, why do parents always think of that constructive crap? It's really obnoxious. I'm sitting here enjoyig my time of peace, no homework, and listening to jazz...and all of a sudden, \"Hey catie, go clean.\" So, I say what I always say, \"Yeah sure, fine, I'll clean.\" (Of course I almost never do this,) except..the problem was, my mom came upstairs, and asked me all nicely and whatnot to clean with that momly voice that makes you feel really guilty. and so I trudge downstairs get the cleaning stuff, and clean the bathroom. Bleh! I can't stand cleaning. I think I should be a gold digger, and marry a rich guy so I can have a cleaning lady, and so I can hire a cook to make me peanut butter sandwiches all the time, and then when I get super duper fat, and this guy wants a divorce, it'll all be good, because I won't have signed a prenuptial agreement. So I'll still get half the assets. Now of course, I'll have to become a witch first in order to make a rich guy, or any guy for that matter marry me. But see...now you all know my plan, so I'll have to come up with a new plan. Oh well. Anyway, I really have nothing to write, but I'm not in the mood to talk to anyone, so I'm just writing. I wish I could go to the park. It's my favorite place in the world. I bring my mini disc thing-a-ma-bobber, and go on the swings, and think and swing at the same time. It really is a fantastic place to go when you need to be alone, and think about stuff...except when the little kids come, and they look at you like you're frankenstein because you're a big kid on a swing...so, they're all afraid to get onto that other swing. It drives them crazy, because I usually stay there for an hour or so. I love little kids. They make me laugh. :) Anyway, I've bored you enough, so I shall write more at some later time.  ~Ya di amore~",
    "Yeah, so this is just a place for me to vent about my, \"oh so horrible life in my bubble town.\" Sarcasm really is wasted online most of the time. I don't know why I bother with it. It either sounds like I'm a mean horrible person, or I'm serious. Oh well, anyway, today was surprisingly good for a Monday. I got a pretty good night of sleep last night, and actually did my homework. Went to school, sadly on the bus...but at least I got to sit alone. Why sit alone you ask? It's my only time to have, \"Alone time,\"  and I had my trumpet with me, so that kind of gets in the way. Anyway, I got to school, and of course said hello to everyone. Brandon was at least feeling a little better today which is good...except for the story that went along with it, which involved him, and ceramic (he, of course did not say that as politely.) Anyway, that was good. Carson came by to see me, and check on this alleged new mitten policy, and she wears mittens in school all the time, so of course she was upset. I made the rounds with her after that, saw cute Jake, a girl from Speech Team, and some other folks. The six minute bell didn't ring so I was a bit late getting to Wind Ensemble. Meh, it's ok. My trumpet section is crazy anyway. We were supposed to be doing sectionals, but that didn't exactly happen...we sort of got yelled at by A. I played my music theory composition (which was horrid)  but I'm glad I got it over with. Mrs. Kane yelled at us about our Lit Analysis papers...no F's but some D's...that'll be me. Anyway, rock climbing in gym today! Yay! It was super fun. I just want to do more of it. Ummm, then the rest of my day was even more uneventful than the first half, but I actually have no homework, so what am I supposed to do with my time? Something else productive? Psh. Yeah right. We didn't end up having combo, which of course...was excellent, because I can't solo...heh. We wont even go down that road, but anyway, then I came home, ate food, and here I am...being incredibly wasteful of my time, and writing this thing. I'll write more later...maybe...if anything actually happens. Anyway, I'm out for now.  ~Ya di amore~",
    ":o) Hey...it looks like Alex. You know, the nose taking up the whole face kind of thing!! Except the smiley is MUCH cuter!",
    "I'm baaack, well, sort of. I have a lesson soon, so I'm really not back for long, just looking for something to do to pass the time. Oh look! A penny! :) So, how was everyone's day? Makes ya think...well, makes me hink, (which is nearly impossible) of who actually answers back to the computer. I certainly do. Then again...I can be seen talking to Genevieve, my locker at school. You know what bugs me? No? Yes? Well, what bugs me (aside from the word, \"bugs,\") is parentheses. I use them all the time, but I don't know how to use them correctly. Grr, pooey. It's like the tootsie roll thing, except instead of, \"The world may never know,\" it's more like, \"Catie may never know because she's an idiot.\" OK...this will probably be a pretty abrupt change in subjects but someone just called me, and I completely forgot what I was writing about, and I don't want to take the effort to get back into the train of thought I was in before. Steve just called about chem stuff. He's such a cool kid, I love him. In a friend kind of way of course. :) He's also got the coolest hair. Chemistry...ah, I dislike it with a deep burning passon that eats away at the soul. No...not really, but..it is rather obnoxious. Well..we had the whole evening with humanities thing kast night. Yikes. It was...not great, lets just put it that way, and never bring it up again. Hmmm, this is odd. I have no homework for once, and I had a free afternoon. No jazz all week. This is both good and bad. I love jazz, and yet...it's nice to have free time. I wonder if anyone's noticed how completely random everything I've written on here is. Heh. More fun! You all know me...spontanious Catie. RAR! Ah, guess what? Guess...come on...I bet you aren't guessing...GUESS!!! Alright sorry, I'll just tell you. I went on high ropes yesterday, and made it across the swinging balance beam with Peter. Of course, Mr. Z finds something wrong in EVERYTHING we do, so...Peter and I didn't do it correctly. Evil. Hmmm...possibly I should go warm up for my trumpet lesson. Yes? No? Ah, that's super fun to say. I'm having so much fun writing random stuff thought. Oh well, more later maybe. You're all fantastic people if you've made it this far. Either that, or your just dumb and don't know that the little X in the upper right-hand corner gets you away from this madness.  *Ya di amore* :o)",
    "Wow, haven't written in a long time. Been pretty busy lately with Disney and then make-up work. Disney was a blast. Even the bus ride wasn't as bad as I expected it to be. it was actually kind of...well...fun. *Gasp* Yes well, I did enjoy myself at Disney, but it's nice to be home. I've created a theory about going on vacation with your friends. Don't. At least for more than two days. After about the second day, people started getting really sick of each other, and got very edgy. (Didn't help that the bus ride there was 31 hours.) Yes, well...I've finaly pretty much caught up with make-up work. Yay! I'm writing this feature story for journalism. I'm actually getting pretty into it. It's about Teenagers VS. Adults. It's pretty fun doing the research for it. Yes...but anyway....not talking about school anymore...it's evil. Our jazz band had a gig on Wednesday, and I got a ride, and was late getting there. I got there at the end of the last song...which is the song I had a soli in. Whoops...Oh well, it happens. Honestly, that's about all that's been going on, and now I'm off to the mall. I wish it would snow... *Ya Di Amore*",
    "Hehe, just finished dinner! Yum! I'm so happy right now. I don't even know why, I just...am! I'm talking to a bunch of my friends while writing this, which is always fun. Plus I'm doing homework, PLUS I'm watching Law & Order...how massively talented am I? Well, my day was pretty kick butt. Umm, no band OR music theory...very cool, so Kristen and I sat together and did homework and discussed Winter. Next period I hung out with Chris and Kelly for a bit (Alex too for a bit, since he was in Gym) and I left eventually. They started working on music, and...I just always end up feeling left out when they do, so, I try to stay away from those two together in general.Oh well, I went and sat alone in a practice room. Darn...no good stories for the newspaper to write about me. That was a great story, no matter how angry people are about the band comment. I wish people would have read the story actually, instead of reaching paragraph two and deciding it was terrible. Well, anyway, umm...EPVM was interesting. I'm getting nervous about my final. My brother said it was difficult...my brother with the perfect ACT AND SAT scores...arg. I just...wow, I'm so afraid of that test. I'm completely going to fail. Gym...oh jeez...two words  Commando Crawl  OWWWWWWWWWWWWWW  Good lord...that was one of the most painful...oh jeez...just thinking about it. Seriously, if you ever by some chance do that for high ropes...WEAR PANTS! Well, yes...wear pants normally, but don't wear shorts, make sure they are pants, because...it's quite painful if you don't. I made it through though, so it's all good! It just hurt...a lot.   Math, boring, shock shock.  Intervening thought: Why do I always write these while talking to Alex??  Lunch...was interesting. Just hung out with Kelly and Emily some, then Chris and Alex. It was cool...not much to it. Comparative Religion was boring...just, meh, presenting projects...and finally chem...boring, shock shock, and then, I came home, and did stuff, and that is the end of my day...therefore, I shall leave, and go kill alex...I mean...wait...you know NOTHING. You have no evidence...:)",
    "I got so many compliments on my hair! It was awesome, I got it cut, and layered last night, and I really really like it! It's shorter, but it's still really great! Right now I'm looking for new furniture for my room. I'm completely re-doing it, except for the floor. I like having a wood floor. Easier to clean if you spill something...which is inevitable with me. So, anyway. jusat waiting for dinner to be done, then all I have to do is study for my Science test. Arg...stupid science. Oh well, we have later arrival tomorrow! YES! I was hoping, and hoping, but I was upset because I wanted a late arrival day, and didn't think we had one, and then Bryan (with a y) was like, \"yeah, norkus you idiot!\" Ouch...oh well, how can one be sad when there's late arrival!?!?! Except, finals are next week, and I'm not ready at all. I should maybe actually study this time, considering I have not studied for finals yet since High School started....surprisingly though...I've done well. I don't get it. If I could just learn not to avoid homework, I'd be doing well. For most kids, it's the tests that make the problem, for me, it's the homework. Yay! Dinner...I'll write more later!..",
    "Avoiding homework...yet again, shock shock. plus i just painted my nails, and typing is something I can actually do without messing them up. I'll go back to homework in a bit. Umm, today was great! I saw *HIM* EEK! like four times. It was great...plus he actually NOTICED me, and spoke to me like...two out of the three times I talked to him. Exciting stuff.:) So, yes anyway, school wasn't bad. I went and sat with my best buds this morning instead of waiting outside the band room. It was fun. I miss seeing them as much as I do. Kathryn's doing well, she was just working on her paper, and of course Joanne and john were flirting. :) They make such a great couple. I get a little jealous at times though. I sort of wish I had someone like that. I'm still deciding who, and IF I want to ask someone to Winter. I would actually really like to go, but who to ask?? Certainly not *HIM* :) Couldn't do that. I figure I'll just go with a friend or something, and it'll all be good. OK...so, anyway, Kelly S. was cool as usual. She was complaining about stuff...as usual, but I love her to death just the same. Yeah, so...umm, went to band, Peter was gone, so...there wasn't AS much making fun of me as there usually is...oh darn. It was actually, ...scary as it is..., a bit unnerving. I actually got used to them all making fun of me every day, and it just wasn't balanced. Meh. Music theory was ok, but I'm still seriously thinking about dropping the class. I mean, I don't learn a lot, and I don't really enjoy the class too much. I could be doing more useful things with my time. Kelly..coyle that is got kind of angry with me about it. Oh well, I have to do what's best for me, and that may be what's best for me. EPVM...borring, as usual. We had a sub...so, whatever, nothing big. Gym..I went on high ropes!!! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!! I was sooooooooooooooooooooooooooo scared. You have no idea. It was terrible...except, fun! I was so scared when I first went up there, but Mehgan and I kicked booty! We got three done today. We could have gotten more if Allen hadn't been an idiot...arg. What a silly boy! He went up there just so he could come back down right away. That's the only reason he wanted to go up. So that wasted a good ten minutes. My watch fell off while I was up there and I totally flipped out! Eek! Kelly got pretty mad at Erica...I don't know...I hope no one's mad at me right now. I just really don't like when people are mad at me.   Math was...arg. I've finally learned the trick to his teaching though. He's actually a pretty darn good teacher if you can stay awake in his class. Eek, sorry, have to go...I'll write more when I get back from getting my hair cut :)",
    "Welp...haha, what a funny word, perhaps because it isn't a word? Yes, yes that is it. Well, anyway, I just finished my paper a bit ago, and now my mom is correcting it. Gulp! I've seriously forgotten how to write normally!!! Stupid Mrs. Kane, and her Journalistic style of writing! I can't write normally anymore, I really can't. I'm always like, \"Is that objective?\" Argh, so annoying! Well, I just vnted to Bryan with Y :) about jazz. I'm really trying to forgive Alstadt it just bothers me SO much. He never asked, never consulted me, didn't even TELL me for heavens sakes! I don't know, forgiving is the right thing to do though, so that's what I will do. This weekends been pretty cool actually. I'm feeling a lot better, and all I did this weekend was read...three books. Good books I might add. I also watched Pretty woman last night. Aww...it was so cute, almost makes me want to become a prostitute and look for love...except, not.  Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking. It is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil, but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails. -1 Corinthians 13:4-8  I love that...I do! It's so great, and so true. There was this other one I saw today...it's not exactly in the Bible, but I thought it was a GREAT quote nonetheless.  \"Be who you are and say what you feel, for those who mind don't matter and those who matter don't mind\"-Dr. Suess!  Again, so great and so true. Oh well, I really must go finish my conversation with Bryan with a Y, and then off to bed...ahh, sleep, I love you!! :) Ya di amore*",
    "Yeah, so avoiding homework right now and talking to Brandon. I'm really scared about this upcoming jazz competition. I know that we're not playing any songs that I really have to solo in, but still, there is Jumpin' at the Westside. I know I'm going to totally freak out...I just know it. Oh well. Anyway, I've been really sick for the past like...week. I'm getting sick of it..heh, sick of being sick. I first had a cold, then an ear infection...arg. Stupid sickness. Oh well...I'll come back and write more in a bit after I finish my paper. I'm determined to finish this thing.  Ya di amore...*",
    "RAR! OK, sorry, just love typing that! :) Well...just writing my music theory final...heh...last minute...rock on! Woo hoo! I had jazz today, I'm umm...doing better, I guess. When he pointed to me, I didn't like...bury my head and say, \"no, no, no! You can't make me!\" Oh well, s'all good. Umm, no finals today really. Lunch...went in at the end...then band (hardest final EVER) and then finally Comparative Religion...which, we didn't have a final in! yay! The rest of my day has been blah, so I'll write more later...maybe...if anything interesting happens. It wont though! :)",
    "OK, so I decided not to go. I talked to Chris about all that was bothering me, and it REALLY helped. Seriously, I love that kid to pieces. He's one of the best people to talk to when you're upset and need someone to listen to you complain. I really didn't want to tell him at first, but...he made me, and I'm glad he did. It felt good to get it out.I cried for the first time in a long time...perhaps since my Grandma's funeral...which was one of the things I was upset about. I just...really miss her a lot. I think I need to cry more...or get upset more, because, it just...hurts so much when it comes in big spurts, and...I don't know. I really want someone to like me for me...actually, I want someone to like me in general. I don't know what's so wrong with me...I really don't. I mean, sure...I'm certainly not good looking,but I'm not worse than some, and I try not to be a bad person, so...I don't understand it. Arg...I just...try so hard, and it feels like no one appreciates it, at all. Oh well, I'll be good tomorrow morning, it's just good for me to write, and talk to people I trust about this sort of thing, and it's not like anyone actually reads this thing anyway...so, heh. Anyway, off to bed. Goodnight.",
    "Once again...I'm upset about winter. Seriously, I keep telling myself to stop, because I'm being selfish, and I've got it better than like...99% of the population on this planet...and I'm complaining about a little dance, and it really is my own fault. I just should have asked someone. This is a real bummer. EVERYONE, and I do mean everyone has a date to this thing...RAR....must go...bye.",
    "Ok, tonight's entry is going to be pretty short. I'm really tired, and..I need a LOT of beauty sleep.  Today was a pretty ordinary day anyway. We had late arrival though, which was cool. Mr. Alstadt wont be here for the next two days...oh darn! I was looking forward to music theory SO much too! Well, yeah, anyway. Nothing interesting happened until I got called down to Mrs. Plumbers...DUN DUN DUN! I didn't do anything, just a mix up, so it's all good now! :)  Then, we had jazz, and I am going to kill Nathan. I wish he'd act more like a section leader, and Tom wont shut up. I think Steve ought to be section leader. He actually cares about sounding good. So...then i came home from jazz, had my lesson, and that was about it. I know this was completely boring, but people get mad if I don't write, then they yell at me, and...arg. So tedious. Oh well...I'm off to...errr, read, or something. then sleep.   Also, my great uncle Al died a few days ago. He was the coolest guy ever. :) So, if you could all say a prayer for his wife, and really close family, I'd appreciate it. :) Thanks everyone, have a nice evening.  XOXO",
    "I miss Heather. She was someone I could tell everything to. Wow do I miss her. :(",
    "Well, my day today was better than yesterday. It started out better though. I can usually tell what kind of day I'll have from the morning. I got my schedule changed today, and I straightened things out with Kathryn, so...she understands why now, which is good. I really didn't want her to be upset with me.   You ever feel like the whole world is against you, and hates you?? I hope not...it's not a great feeling. I feel like I have no real friends right now, no one that I can really turn to when times get rough, or when I'm upset. I miss Amanda, I miss Hillary, and I miss Kelly. I've just been so sad lately...and I'm not sure why. I guess I miss having a best friend, and...wow, I just really want a boyfriend. As pathetic as this all is, I do. I would think if I had a boyfriend, he'd be someone who listens to me, and...it's just not going to happen anytime soon. Yeah, I'm going to Winter now...but, now I realize it wasn't Winter that I wanted to go to...it was WHO I wanted to go with. I wanted to go with someone like I really liked...not a friend, and...it all just sucks right now. I kind of feel like crying, and...that's not me most of the time.   Yeah...so, feeling a little better, sorry...I was having an EXB moment. OOO, bad moment to have...very bad! Listening to some Dave Matthews...again, which is fun, so...yeah. Anyway...I have to go, people are actually IM'ing me. Drat. Maybe I'll write more later.  :I",
    "Well...ok...the Bucs won. Yay?? I'm not usually a big football fan, which is shocking considering everyone in my family loves football...and I'm in marching band. Man am I a weird kid. Well...anyway, we have a small problem now, I may be going to Winter...finally, like I wated, but...now Kelly's kind of out in the cold. :( We're thinking maybe she could go with Neil or something, since we all know Neil, and it'd be fun. We don't want to leave her out of this. I kind of wish that I could invite Kristen and Alex, and Taylor and her boyfriend, but...I'm not sure if Kathryn and Joanne would be cool with that. I'm just really confused right now. I can't believe we have school tomorrow. :( It feels like we don't...maybe because of the Superbowl, but...I don't know. I should probably just stop writing before I write something I don't mean to, which would force me to actually start looking at things with a different perspective. I still can't believe we actually placed yesterday...but, I really want to know how many bands there were....it's probably like marching. We got 5th...but...out of 5 bands. Whoops. Hehe. Except...that was last year, because this year...we rocked the kazba...and, I have no clue why I just said that. Wow...Catie, you're a weirdo. And now I'm talking to myself too...ok, sleep would be good now...yes...definitely...sleep...now...Good night all! Hope you have sweet dreams!!! :)",
    "Evereryone else is watching the superbowl,.so there's nothing else to do. I've been thinking about stuff. I said I wanted to go to Winter and everything...but, now that I am, I'm not sure if I really want to. Like, yeah...I asked him, but...I'm just going with him as a friend. I want to go with someone as more than a friend, someone I really do like. I mean...I love him as a friend, and I've known him for so long, but...I just wish I were going with someone I like as more than a friend. :( Oh well, it's still really nice just to be going. I wish it weren't so cold out, I need to go for a walk err, a bike ride or something! And just...think. I love people, I really do, but...I need my alone time. It was like poor Emily on the Disney trip. I just need to be alone! I'm actually getting sort of excited about Winter now. I'm talking to Joanne and Kristen, and they're excited for me...so...I'm getting excited too. I think it will be fun, especially with a group of people I like spending time with! Anyway...more later, I'm actually having conversations with people NOT watching the Superbowl! YAY!",
    "Wow...I can't believe it. I almost wish I could have seen more class AA bands. JSO didn't win any awards...which, completely shocked me. I mean...they are awesome. In the words of Alex, \"There must have been some seriously Godly bands if they beat JSO!\" But oh well...considering JSO isn't my band, we'll talk about Jazz Band...which places 3rd...probably out of 3 bands, but still. :) It was nice to place, and have JSO not...considering they're like...saintly, and...well...we suck. My soli went ok, not too bad. I guess I still have to play louder, and I didn't mess up any of the notes, messed up the timing a bit at 110, but..other than that, it was actually pretty good...I thought. Well, anyway...I'm not quite sure what's going on with Andy and Diane, but....it seems like Diane is happy, so...if she's happy, then I'm happy too. That's really all I wanted to write for right now. Haha, that amuses me. Write for right. OK...anyway, must be off to...I don't know...do something fun since there's no homework!!!! YES! :) Anyway, I'll write more later maybe.  :)",
    "Wow, I just...can't even write right now...I feel so terrible. All I have to say is that I'm an idiot.",
    "I couldn't sleep...I guess I get way too upset over stuff like this...but, I am REALLY upset. Supposedly Zach is in surgery, and Richa has internal bleeding...jeez. Why?? Supposedly there was also another accident in which a student died...it's all so depressing. I just want everyone to stay safe, and I really wish there was someone to talk to right now, but there isn't...everyone who would be online and who I could talk to is happily asleep. I seriously don't know whether to cry, or...what. I mean...I have cried...but, jeez, sometimes I wish I didn't care so much about people I don't know well. It wouldn't hurt as much if I only got upset over people I was really good friends with. It's just so unfair though. They're both so smart and nice...and....arg...just, why them??? Why the heck them....? I feel like I should tell the people I really care about how much I care about them, but...it's really hard for me to express my emotions like that. It makes me so sad though...so so so sad. I kind of wish I could go back to the days of elementary and junior high...at least people seemed safe there. No one ever got seriously hurt or died during either...  There's also that feeling like...I want to help somehow, but there's really nothing I can do. I mean...I'll pray, but somehow I feel that I should do something other than pray, something physical...I don't know anymore...maybe I just need to go clear my head....I was going to write about my day, but it doesn't really matter right now. I just hope they're ok...",
    "Why is it that bad things happen to good people?? I wish the quote, \"Good things happen to good people,\" was true, but it isn't always. Two really great people were in a car accident tonight, and they are in stable condition, but...still, it's terrible. They're upstanding people, and it shouldn't have happened to them. I hope they'll be ok, and I'll definitely be praying for them. They both contribute a lot to our school, and will continue to contribute a lot to the world when they leave High School. I guess I'm still trying to grasp onto the concept that bad things DO happen to good people...even if they're not just good people, but great people.   It also makes me incredibly grateful to have the life I have...to have a great family, have money, have shelter, have food, have friends, have...life. I just wish that it didn't take things like Kari's death...or Richa and Zach's accident to slap me in the face and make me realize it. I always get mad at people when I think they're being selfish or thinking too much about themselves, when I, myself, am probably being selfish.. But, I guess...as a friend just told me, \"It's times like these you have to have faith.\" I do. I mean, I say my prayers every night, but...a lot of times, I just say them to say them. I don't really think about who or what I'm praying for. I'll really think...and, I'll definitely be praying for Richa and Zach, and I hope other people can take the time to as well...",
    "i can't stop typing in this thing. I don't know why. My fingers wont stop. It's like they each have little individual minds of their own, except...I only type with two fingers. My two index fingers. I type pretty darn fast for that though. Lalalalalalala. Seriously, it is good to laugh a lot. Typing constantly is sort of keeping my mind off of truly thinking of the audition, and considering it all.   Hmmm. I'm talking with Brett, and Matthew. It's fun. I enjoy talking to both of them. I'm trying not to bring up the A audition though...   You know, I think I'd rather be known as prude and not be able to get guys, then a slut who can get guys. If I'm going to get herpes, I want to get it from someone I'm going to spend the rest of my life with.    Haha, sorry. I was just having a conversation about that with someone.  And I'm gone again...",
    "Sorry I sounded petty, and dumb and selfish.  I said haha a lot in that. Wow, it's good to laugh more. Hahahahahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahaha.  No seriously, am I always this loony?",

Haha. It made me happy. I think I'm going to make a list of things I don't like too but, I'll save that for my next really bad mood. I'm in a good mood now. The weather is actually semi-decent, and...hmmm, yeah! Oh well, I'm outta here for now. Peace. (I've always wanted to say that.)  XOXO :)",

    "Top Ten Reasons to Go Out With a Guy (These aren't in any real order.)  Intelligence Humor Kindness Good Morals Smells good :) Haha, had to be here. Good conversationalist. Fun to be around Being Hot. (Yeah, it's shallow, and it's not a necessity but, it is a plus.) Sensitivity. Yeah right, like this one's ever going to happen. Trustworthy.  Oh yeah! Just had a conversation with someone about this. Yeah, that'd be the perfect guy. Most definitely. Too bad none exist, or if they do, I'm just not noticing.  Anyway, my day was most excellent. I went to woodfield with my mom and shopped. Ah, it was so much fun. Hmmm, I think more people than I realize read this thing, so now I'm scared. I just put it on my profile for fun, except, now people know. They KNOW. Ahhh. Anyway, yeah.   Why do potentially good girlfriends pick terrible boyfriends, and vise versa? I've never understood it. Oy's so dumb. Almost as dumb as me but not quite.  So, I really have nothing to write, so...I think I'll stop now. Yep...stopping right.......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................now.",
    "Yeah, ummm, things are good. I made it. 5th chair, before Dan, haha, yes! I walked into band behind Dan, while Peter's saying, \"She beat you.\" Hahaha, the look on his face was the funniest thing I've EVER seen. It was so great. But yeah, I made it, and I'm happy about it, but...I'm still in a crappy mood. I want to go back to my old crazy self. I want to stop...being other people. I was having a conversation about this with a certain somone the other day, and he said he was doing that. Like...I take bits of other people's personality and make them me...It's so dumb. I need to be myself. I need to be crazy. I need to be fun. I need to not be shy. I need to be fun. I also need to be more trustworthy...but, that's a long way off. Maybe I am me. I'm really not sure. All I know is that I'm so incredibly confused about everything right now. I don't even feel like I care about the \"A\" audition. That's pathetic, I spent so much time worrying about it. I just feel like I care about nothing right now. I hate feeling that way.  Man, I'm just...not supposed to feel this way. I'm supposed to feel happy. Nothing's gone wrong, there's really nothing to complain about. I just...feel sad I guess.   Oh well, life goes on. I'm probably just having a bad day. Probably because it's cold out again. Argh, anyway, I'm off to go shopping with my mom at Oakbrook. Wow, I'm not even that excited about that. This is terrible. Oh well, I'm sure I'll have fun anyway.   I'll probably write more later. This is a writing kind of day...  XOXO",
    "Well, I'm really still not feeling bad for what I said. Jim mentioned it to me and thought I was talking about Dave K. Today. I was like, no no no no no! Haha. I actually thought Dave K. was mad at me today. It was weird...  Anyway, school was ok. Still didn't technically find out, but Mr. A. said I'm ok, and not to worry, so...I wont. Jazz was actually ok today, I was playing..and not THAT softly either! :) So, there's really not much to know about my day since it was boring and stuff.  I don't really feel like typing now actually. Nor later perhaps?   You know who it is, and if you don't, you're just not cool...  XOXO",
    "YES! I made Wind Ensemble, and I'm so happy...except, not really. I wish.  They didn't have the results posted today! Argh. I'm so mad. They said, \"We'll post them on Monday\" and then today they say, \"well, we're not quite done, we'll put them up tomorrow.\"  Argh.  Oh well, anyway. I must be off, just wanted to type about how frustrated I am that the results aren't out yet. :(",
    "Brilliant, absolutely brilliant!  Haha, I don't even know. I just had this huge urge to say that! Anyway, today's been better with thinking about the audition and stuff. I haven't thought about it as much, but yeah...dun dun dun.  Results come out tomorrow, but in the afternoon!!! Grrrrrrrrrr, that's so pooey. I just want to know for better, for worse.  Oh well, sucks to be me...except, not really. I like being me :)",
    "Wow, I was insane last night, and do you want to know why??? No, you already know why. I mentioned it 50 billion times last night. Ahhh...can't Monday come sooner??? PLEASE! Time is dragging by, and it's the weekend. Time on the weekend isn't supposed to drag by!  Well, I left for a while before finishing this to go read. I'm reading this book called Tangerine. I've read it like two times before, but, for some reason...I really like it. I don't know.  Anyway, there's nothing much else to write now. I don't think I'll end up doing anything today. My mom's leaving in a few hours for a business trip, so...yeah. Anyway, I think I'll go read more.",
    "Hm, haven't written in a while. Well, jazz cafe was last night. It was most excellent. I was really very surprised.. I wasn't expecting to have fun at all. I didn't even want to go. I danced all through JSO playing. It was super fun. Heh, anyway, I really have nothing more to say. I think I'm gonna go actually. I'll prolly write more later.   G'night you princes and princesses.  :)",
    "Wow, I am in such a better mood. I just talked to Christopher for like...2 hours. Man, I love that kid haha. He put me in the best mood. He's like my brother. It rocks like no other! :)  Goodnight you princes and princesses!  XOXO",
    "I just noticed...my entries have been getting more frequently sad. Because I've been more sad, or because I've actually been being honest with myself for once and admitting I'm upset?",
    "We go on...through the joy and through the tears. We go on...to discover new frontiers.....  I miss Disney Word so so much :(   I bet I'd be happy if I were there right now.",

    "Yeah, it's kinda like that...                 But not really. :)    Haha, sorry. I really had no purpose for writing that. I'm just sort of avoiding doing this government crossword puzzle. Man, it's taking for fricking ever!!! Holy cow. It's not even funny. This thing is impossible, and it's worth more than the test. Heh. YaY government? RAR! OK, anyway, I think my weekend on average was pretty decent. I really didn't do all that much. Just kinda hung out. I cleaned my room though!! Like...really cleaned, I washed my floor (since it's hardwood) and cleaned all my furniture and everything! It's amazing. Except, it's all weird, because everything's all neat, and everything's where it's supposed to be. It's confuzzling. Ah, I love making up words. So much fun. It turns out I didn't have a gig according to Brandon. He better be right, haha. Yeah, so, umm, I think I was supposed to do something with Kathryn today, but...I ended up going to lunch and stuff. Oopsies. I hope she isn't too mad. I talked to her on the phone for a while, and she seemed ok, but...kinda mad since she knows about Joanne, Diane, and me going out to lunch. Eeks. Oh well, we'll do something this upcoming weekend. Haha. Coffee smells good. Matthew and I are talking about coffee. I think I'm the only person who doesn't actually like the taste of it. I like the smell though, so good enough. Can you tell I'm rambling? I know I can. I'm procrastinating like no other. Oh well...back to the drudgeries of doing homework. :(  XOXO",
    "I think I upset Diane. I asked her a lot of questions about being vegetarian today. I didn't mean for them to upset her. I've just never known anyone who is vegetarian so, I sort of wanted to know about it. I was just curious, that's all. I hope I didn't upset her. I hope she's jjust having a cranky day or something. Haha, no..I don't hope she's having a cranky day. I hope she's having a great day, but...she seems to be kind of upset. I just hope it wasn't me.",
    "Sometimes I really wish people didn't read this, and other times, I do. People actually hear..or see what I have to say with this thing, but...that's not necessarily a good thing. Hmmm, I'm talking with Andrew. Haha, he thinks I'm a creepy kid. This is funny.  Anyway, umm, I think I might have a jazz gig, but I have no clue.Eeks. Oh well, they can't blame me when I knew nothing about it! AHHH!  So, I went out to lunch with Diane and Joanne today. It was a lot of fun. I felt kind of bad though, because Diane and I were talking about all this marching stuff, and Joanne doesn't know about it and stuff. Every time I'm with band people I do that, and I really don't mean to, because I feel like I'm making people feel so left out when I do that. It was fun though, reminiscing. I kind of miss freshman year, but 'eh. Not that much. I like sophomore year too. It's cool. Hehe, anyway. Must be off. Heh, seriously, if I hadn't gone crazy years ago, I probably would now...  XOXO",

    "You know, I was just thinking, Harry Potter needs an invisibility cloak to get around Hogwarts at night, but, even though I have white hair, I'm still invisible to most. Most of the time I feel like second best, or third. With the exceptions of a few people, like Kelly and Emily for example. Yeah, they're best friends, but they ALWAYS make me feel like I'm just as important to both of them as they are to each other. But, then there's some people who seem to always make me feel like I'm not good enough. Like, \"oh, I guess we'll call you after we make sure everyone else isn't busy.\" Argh. It's just not cool. I try to ignore it, but it's difficult. Oh well..just...a though.  XOXO",
    "I didn't think I'd be this upset over my brother leaving. :( I'm really upset about it. He just left, and...I don't know. I'm going to miss him a lot. It just makes me sad to think how little time I really have left to spend with my family. I'll be going off to college in two years, and then start my own life, and my own family from there on. I'm one of very few people who actually enjoys spending time with my family. I really get along with them. They get me away from the shallow selfishness of High School. They have actual intelligent conversation. I'm just...sad :(",
    "Hm, ok, so, there really isn't anything else to do. So, I decided, I'd just keep typing until either my mommy calls or gets home. I'm going out to dinner with my family tonight. It's my brother's last night here before he goes to Australia tomorrow. I think I'm actually going to miss him a lot. He's there for me a lot, and I can actually talk to him. It's kind of surprising. :( Oh well, at least I'll have my bathroom to myself, but that's not enough. I'd rather have my brother here I think. I don't know, I've just gotten so much closer to him in the last few months and stuff.   Anyway, back to non-depressing stuff. Oh wait, my day was sad. Haha, not totally actually, just my speech. It was so bad. I'm never practicing for a speech again. It messed me up. That, and bringing my whole outline up there with me. Oh well, I don't think I really wanna talk about it/write any more about it. Too painful to think of.  I wore a skirt. I like skirts, but I don't. It's weird. Anyway, my mom just called. She's on her way home from the airport, YaY! I'm off to....I don't know, get a life.  Byebye!",
    "Still can't get to it. the servers are too busy. I can sign in and stuff, but I can't put an entry in. Poo.",
    "Oh my gosh. Professor Semanic can eat flamingo poo! ARGH! I DID let him know I wasn't going to be there for jazz cafe with an e-mail, and he wasn't able to do it anyway! What the heck is that mans problem? He has a huge one. RAR! Sorry, just a little angry. I don't think he's fair or justified, and he's yelling at us for not having consistency in rehearsals and...heh, guess what? HE CANCELLED FOR THE NEXT TWO WEEKS! Wow that man makes me mad, but...yeah, oh well. I can't write in my real diary because I can't get to it. My real diary is online, but...it's locked and whatnot...so, yeah. I can't get to it, that makes me mad too. :( Oh well, I think I'll go try again.",
    "Oh yeah, that gig last night, did NOT do wonders for my self esteem. It loweered it. Stupid gig, we did horribly. RAR! Anyway, the gig tonight went well and all. It was kinda fun. Kelly drove me, and on the way home we stopped at McDonald's. It was so cool! So, we got some chow, and then rode home listening to the soundtrack to Now and Then. We sang really loudly and I danced. It was soooo fun!! I love Kelly S. I love Kelly C too! Kellys just rock my world basically!   Anyway, I swear, I really will stop writing in here.     Maybe?",
    "Yeah, so, today was pretty ordinary.  Hmmm, I don't even remember half of what I did today. I was so out of it. Haha, i wore my black hoodie with the hood up, and nobody could recognize me at first because they usually go by the hair. I also looked pretty stoned. Like, five people this morning told me I looked stoned. It was funny.   Oh, the juniors might have to take the ACT all over again. Man, that'd suck so much. Supposedly four ACT answer booklets were stolen. they had an assembly about it and everything. It's all pretty messed up.  Man, I hate group work so much in math. It's the most messed up thing in the world. GRRRR!   I completely lucked out on my government packet today. I don't really wanna explain how, but...I felt I needed to thank someone for letting me get 33/35 when I did the packet after the tes right before we graded it in ten minutes. Too much to explain, but it was excellent. Anyway, I think I'm sick of typing in this public area again, so...I think I'm going for the whole private diary again. I still type in there, but i also type in here. I think maybe I'll just type in there from now on, because two entries is too much for a lazy person like me.",
    "OK, so, I'm indecisive. I decided that I wouldn't stop writing in here, well...for now. I just decided to write in here today instead of my actual journal. Who knows why? My mind works in mysterious ways.  Anyway, school was ok today, nothing too special. I saw a lot of my friends, and had a good talk with Emily over lunch. I think Dave saw that one entry in here, because he's been a lot nicer to me in the past couple days, or at least since Jazz Cafe. Maybe he's just gone back to his old self. I really hope so. I missed the old Dave. He was so different from most guys. RAR, guys are pooey.   But, yeah, anyway, I didn't do much this past weekend. The only real thing I did was hang out with Chris, jim, and Alex. It was actually a lot of fun. Haha, Alex's mom fed us dinner. It was really good. Then we went to Chris's to watch Swimfan and the Matrix, which I hadn't seen. Wow, that's such an awesome movie. I usually don't like those types of movies, but I liked this one. It was so cool!   I have to go soon. We've got a gig at Ellsworth Elementary. It'll be fun. I wonder if we get to see the kids play. That'd be so cool. It'd do wonders for my self esteem.   Eeps, anyway, I'm outta here.   Actually, before that, I heard this really mean saying the other day that I thought was funny, but...argh, it was so mean. I feel terrible for laughing at it. They said, \"I'm outta here like the fat kid in dodgeball.\"  That's terrible, is it not? I still can't believe I laughed then, I feel so mean.  Anyway, I am out of here. I probably wont write again tonight considering the amount of homework I have.   Goodnight you princes and princesses! :)",
    "Well, I think I'm going to stop writing in here because I found a good site to write, where no one can see it, so...I'll actually write what I need to, and what I want to. I may start writing in here again at some point, but...'eh, I highly doubt it.",
    "It's weird. I hate eating in front of other people. I always feel so guilty. I don't know why. I eat so much at home. I should be like, half the size of mexico.",
    "Yeah, so...I spent the evening with Chris. It was fun. I think he thinks I'm really annoyed with him though, and I'm not at all. I'm jujst annoyed with most people right now, and I'm irritable. I can't wait for summer to come. I NEED summer. Hmmm. Oh well, haha, we went to chili's. It was interesting. I haven't been there in so long. I got this really big dessert. Haha, so good...but....too much. I think I'll go running tomorrow.   But, anyway...that's really all I want to say right now because I can't really type everything I need to in this journal.   Byebye.",
    "I beat the system. I'm supposed to be researching for a speech, and I couldn't get on here from the school computer at first, but I can now. YES! Ahahaha, I beat the system. I'm typing in here, and I'm not supposed to be during school. I'm a rebel!!!",
    "Well, since blogger is DUMB, my entry for today got deleted.   Stupid blogger.  Oh well, I really don't feel like typing it again so, I wont.  Maybe I'll write more later.  Bye.",
    "I'm not intelligent I'm not pretty I'm not funny I'm not a slut I don't like most people I'm not nice I'm too loud but too quiet I'm too untrusting I'm selfish  Please, if you think of anymore...let me know.",
    "Today, was good overall. Yes, very good.  :)  Turn the faucet off baby See we're floodin' the floor now What a shame  Drown the neighbors out baby Our little love tub's out the door No more rap, nor more dub The steam Is almost hidin' you away In our tub of love here I'll scrub all over you and you can scrub... All over me  Just move your leg a bit  And I'll move mine We'll get so clean Our love is lookin' fine  I'm shining now and so are you In our tub of love, life is new We're almost perfect now, me and you.  I really don't take those words in a sexual nature. They just make me think. Sure, they could be meant in a sexual way but, I didn't take them that way.  So, yeah. There's no one right now thankfully I think. I'm kind of glad I don't like anyone. I don't have to feel all awkward around people, and it's just so much more complicated when I do like someone.  I'm really avoiding my science lab. I wish I could have gone to Kohl's with Brandon. Oh well. I talked to Chris on the phone for a bit, and still avoided doing my lab.   I've been talking to Erica a lot the past few days. It's been nice. Anyway...must go actually do homework. :(  Poo.  Bye.",
    "OK, Chris isn't mad at me, but...I'm still sort of down. I don't know why. I truly don't. I'm sure there's some reason deep down inside and I just don't realize it, but...ARGH! It's super annoying.",
    "Dag nabbit. I think Chris is mad at me now because I'm an idiot and was short with him last night because I was in a bad mood. I wasn't mad at him, just...maf in general. Argh, oh well.",
    "Talked to Kathryn on the phone for a bit. I needed it. I'm glad she was home. :)  I think I'm going to call someone. I don't want to be alone tonight.",
    "I'm lonely. No one around to talk to, to hug, to just be with. Being with a big group of people wont help it. I'll still feel alone deep inside. It's hard to understand. I need just the right person to be with right now, and I don't even know who it is. I just, need to be with someone I can trust, someone I really care about. I  think I want to spend tonight with Joanne and Kathryn and Kelly and Mary Clare. I need people I can talk to, have real conversations with, cry around without feeling stupid. I need a shoulder, and yet...nothing is there. Just air.The air I need to live, the air I need to breathe, and yet...it's doing nothing for me right now. I'm still sad. People just distract me from it for a bit.",
    "I just took a shower. I love showers. They always make me feel so good.    Today is going to be a good day!! No matter what!",
    "You know....Diane really is an amazing person. She's terrific at cheering me up. So is Joanne. And that's all I've got to say about that.",
    "Well, I'm less angry now after having talked with a certain someone. Thanks a lot. You know who you are. I don't know. I think I just needed to talk to a specific type of person tonight. I'm glad I'm not so angry anymore though. I don't even know why. I don't get it. I mean, I was super angry, and just so dissapointed with the world, and so annoyed. I'm sure this will all be better tomorrow though.  Goodnight",
    "??????? - (1:31:56 AM): hell your like the best person i know  One of those people is doing a darn good job of cheering me up. Thank you.",
    "The only people I'd even want to talk to right now are my mom, Ryan, and Alex.",
    "I don't get why I'm so angry/annoyed with some people and perfectly ok with others.",
    "Darnit. I am so angry and dissapointed, and sad right now. It's not cool.",
    "You know who the coolest person in the world is? Someone who's so special they deserve an award? Ryan. Ryan Dewitt. Thanks Ryan. I love you!",
    "Oh yeah, I found out Peter doesn't hate me like no other. I'm glad. I don't like thinking that people hate me. Not a good feeling.",
    "The last few days have been ok. Just kind of chillin. I'm sick though, and I've been feeling like crap all week, so, I finally stayed home because I had no huge obligations. Thank goodness. I'm starting to feel better just from getting some actual sleep.  I had marching, \"tryouts\" both Wednesday and Thursday Yesterday was basics. It wasn't nearly as hard as I thought it was going to be, thank goodness. I'm actually kind of glad I stuck with marching, and promised my mom I'd do it. We watched the senior movie with the song, \"We Go On,\" in it. It's a song from my Freshman year show. It always makes me so sad.  Anyway, scariest conversation ever last night. I was talking to Chris, and he's like, \"What if I just told you how I really felt about you?\"  I started flipping out, because I couldn't tell if he was serious or not, because I couldn't hear his voice, and I was like, \"Ah, he's already had a crappy week, how the heck am I supposed to say this nicely.\"  And, someone asked me later that night, when we were talking about people we like, \"Why don't you just go out with Chris?\"   I don't think people get that we're just good friends and nothing more. I don't think I could ever go out with Chris. Ever. It'd be way too weird, and...ick. Just...no. No offense to him of course. I mean, he feels the same way, so....people, just...forget it. Chris and I don't like each other, and never will. Well, like as more than friends. I'm just sick of it.  I wish people could realize that just because I have guy friends, doesn't mean I like them, or want to go out with them. I had a conversation with Bryan about it. It's actually really easy to talk to Bryan. I'm glad he's my friend. And no, I don't like Bryan as more than a friend.  Enough said. You get my point. Byebye.",
    "I was reading a past entry of mine, and I said how I could never forgive him for what he did to her. I don't think it's my place to forgive in the first place. It's her's. I certainly don't think what he did is right, nor do I condone it, and certainly I would kick his scrawny butt if he ever did anything to hurt her again, but it's still not my place to forgive.  I doubt anyone's going to understand this entry at all, but I needed to write it for my own personal well-being.",
    "I put that conversation with Katharine in here because it makes me happy. It jut made me feel really special, and it will be good for me to look at when I feel sad. Who knows if she really meant it though? Maybe she does that with everyone. Oh well. I really don't know.  My head hurts, and my nose hurts, and my eyes hurt from rubbing them.  I just hurt!  Dumb colds. My mom gave me her cold she had for the past weekend, and I have an eye doctor appointment tomorrow. Those aren't good to have when your eyes are watering alll over the place! :(  Oh well, not much to say about today. It was pretty boring. I'm doing marching band down I think. Brandon got section leader, but...so did Peter. It's confusing. Brandon got section leader for marching, and Peter got it for music or something. It's all very confusing.I guess Brandon's highter in the chain of command though, which is good because Peter hates me like no other.  Ah, too much to do at once.  Nothing more iinteresting to say anyway.  Byebye! :)  Overall mood for the day: Happy",

It just...kind of hurts sometimes to have no one like you. No one care for you.   Everyone teases me. EVERYONE. I get kind of sick of it sometimes. I like it sometimes, because it is a lot of attention, but then there's those times when it really truly hurts. I hate when people make fun of me because I can't see well. You want to make fun of me for it? Then fix it! I know I can't see well. It wasn't exactly my choice, so...back OFF! Argh. Even when I tell people not to. They stop for a bit, then go right back to it. Tell me, why is it so easy to pick on me? Why? What is it about me that makes it so incredibly easy? I mean, I'm certainly not miss America, but I'm a pretty good person for the most part. I try to be nice, and honest, and have good morals, and people just keep shooting me down. Why try to be a good person when all people do is shoot you down? What's the point? I'll tell you something. There is none. I like being me, but it's hard sometimes to do the right thing when everyone still makes fun of you. I don't see people who do wrong things get shot down. It's cool now to go get drunk on a Friday night. It's cool to have STD's because you've had sex with however many people. It's cool to be mean, and heartless. Well, heh, cool people suck I guess.  I'm really just sick of it all. I respect very few people at my school. I can't wait for summer to come to be through with it. Then, the next year, I can go back and do it all over again. Dislike people all over again. Be upset over how people do wrong things CONSTANTLY all over again.   I want to stay in Michigan. I want to be away from it all. I want to not see almost everyone here. I know I wont respect the people there anymore, but, it'll take longer because I don't know them. I don't know that some of them actually have the potential to be good people. I don't know that some of them just do it to be popular.  For what? For four years of true misery? For four years of hating yourself but loving the attention? For four years of wasting your time on people you probably wont see again?  Some four years.",
    "Today's been kind of a bummer. I'm in a bummed out mood, and I really want to see him. I know I shouldn't like him, and maybe I don't really, but...man, it feels like I do. I'd like to do something with him outside of school. I think he'd be pretty fun to hang out with. Oh well. Tonight I'm going to see Bruce Almighty with Kathryn hopefully. It'll be a fun time. YaY! Everyone seems so busy, and my weekend seems SO boring. I'm not sure why, but...'eh. What I want is to see someone I can't, and that doesn't hwlp things.   Yesterday was a good day. School was pretty boring as usual, and then last night I went to One Acts with Kelly, Kathryn, and Joanne. It was really funny, and Mary Clare tugged her ear FIVE times to say hello to us up on stage. :) It was neato. During intermission we went down where a bunch of band people were, and there must have been somethin in the air, because we were all acting CRAZY! Wooo! Anyway, it was fun and...yeah, now I'm off to go to the movies with Kathryn! Woo hoo.  Byebye.",
    "I'm not sure what kind of mood I'm in. She said it was no big deal, but...I still think she's mad at me. She said not to worry about her, and...I guess I'll try. I just care about her, and never ever want to say anything that would make her upset. :( I need to think.",
    "Wow, so, yes. Yesterday was fun. i went the whole school day without talking. It was interesting. I get $20 though. YaY! But, yeah, I couldn't write down that I was in a bet with someone, or speak obviously, so...I had to get one person to guess. Luckily after that one person guessed it was easier, because I got him to tell some people, etc. It was fun. So, then I went home, couldn't find my dress for the concert and freaked out. Haha. I found it eventually, but...still. Um, I went to the concert, and it was fun. We didn't suck horribly shockingly. I was amazed. Concert band was ok. Kristen and I sat there and found six good things about them. 1.) Red bow ties, 2.) Recognizeable melody, 3.) Good beat, 4.) When they stood up, they made this arch type thing, tallest in the middle, and shortest going out, 5.) Mr. S! 6.)Hmmm, I do not remember. Oh well. We did come up with six.   So, it was fun overall, but, I was glad to get home and sleep. It was exciting. I actually slept the whole night without waking up once. I was so tired I guess.   Today was ok. Just a pretty normal day until marching. Well, actually...marching was pretty normal too, but...yeah. We just did washington post, like we do every parade, and then went outside and marched for a bit. Fun stuff, 'eh? Hmmm. Brandon drove me home, and here I am. Heh.  I feel terrible though. I have this joke with my friend. She's incredibly skinny, and it's this joke about her being fat, and complaining about it and whatnot, but...I didn't think before I put this joking away message on that said how I don't like when people who are skinny think they're fat, but...I really didn't think before I spoke, or...wrote I guess. So, of course someone who I really hadn't intended to hurt, or even direct that toward saw it, and...I think she got upset. I was looking at her away message, and she seemed kind of upset, so...I looked at her diary thing, and I saw. I just, feel so terrible I tried calling her but she's eating dinner. I really need to talk to her and straighten this out, because it wasn't ablout her. Argh. I REALLY need to be more careful of what I say. Heh, this gives me a good example for my speech on how people need to think before they say things though.    Yes, she got online. Phew!",
    "Well, I had a pretty busy day. Lots to write about, but I'm just so exhausted I can't right now. I Will write about it tomorrow. Wow, lots of, \"writes\" and, \"rights\" Wheee. Yeah ok, I'm too tired. Byebye.",
    "You know. Heh, kind of funny what this all makes me think. He's actually never ever had the right to do that. He's never earned it. He's had so much time, and nope, it's more important. It'd probably take him twice the time he's known me to earn the right.  I do realize no one has any idea what I'm talking about. I guess it's a good thing.",
    "Argh!!!!!! Get AWAY from me you jerk! Get away, get away, get away. I don't like you now. I don't want to speak to you right now. I don't want to speak to you for a VERY loooong time. I know I will in a few days, but for now, STAY THE HECK AWAY FROM ME! I'm not gong to say I hate you because I'll probably regret it later, but...I certainly feel like saying that. YUCK! GET AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!! I seriously just need to get that out. It's not all out yet. I'm still extremely mad, and extremely annoyed, and EXTREMELY upset.   Who are you to tell me that when you can't even control your OWN life? Who are you to tell me that when you are in absolutely no condition to? Who are you? Huh? I'll tell you who you are. A huge jerk. Yeah, you tell me this when you have the right to, and I'll listen. Tell me now, I'll come close to hurting you. BACK OFF!!!",
    "Well, today was an ok day.  Band was normal, except for being in the auditorium, which stinks because it's so warm under the lights in there. Music Theory, thank god he didn't talk. I couldn't have handled it today. Chem, we did a lab, blah blah blah, nothing interesting. Health, we went over the female reproductive system and whatnot. This girl Kat in my class is fearless. She asks questions noone would even THINK about asking. And she shared some...umm, interesting facts about herself that I didn't need to know. Let's just put it this way. before she left she said, \"Well, now that you all know my menstruel cycle.\" Eeks.  Speech was boring. We took a quiz dealy thing and such. I have to change my topic for persuasive because I can't get enough sources. Heh, my speech is Friday too. :(  Lunch was normal. Math we took a reallly hard quiz, and gov. was fun as always. Right before government though, like, in the hall on the way, I got into one of my quiet modes. I'm not unhappy or sad, or even angry, I just feel like being quiet. Everyone gets all scared when I go into my quiet mode though and always ask what's wrong twenty thousand times. Oh well.  I'm going to go make my dinner now, so...yes. Goodbye.",
    "Oooo, someone bet me that I couldn't be quiet for a whole day of school. I'm definitely taking the challenge. Definitely. Ahahahaha. It will be most excellent. Seriously. The only trouble with be explaining this to people.",
    "I feel like being quiet. It's always so funny when I feel like being quiet. People always ask me, \"What's wrong?\" \"Are you ok?\" Catie! What happened?\" Nothing. I'm perfectly fine, perfectly happy, and...perfectly quiet. It's ok to be quiet isn't it? People act like it's a sin. Dag nabbit, just let me be quiet. Hehe. Anywho, I'm off to go eat dinner/do something constructive...maybe?",
    "I'm going to smile like nothing's wrong, talk like everything's perfect, act like it's just a dream, and pretend its not hurting me...because one day it won't and everything will be ok.",
    "We come to love not by finding a perfect person, but by learning to see an imperfect person perfectly.",
    "Talking to Christy right now. It's actually really awesome. I miss her. I can trust her so much it's unbelievable. She's probably the single most trustworthy person to ever be in my life other than my mom.",
    "So, yeah, I didn't end up doing anything. Oh well, I guess it happens. I guess I just didn't want to spend my Saturday night alone. Argh. I wish I could drive. That would be really nice. Being able to drive would be a total escape for me. I could go places by myself and not bring anyone else, or have to get a ride from anyone else. It would be so super nice. *Sigh* I just want summer to come. I want to go to Michigan. I want to feel the sand beneath my feet, and the cool waves splash against my legs. :I want to walk alone along the beach at sunset. I just want to be by myself in a beautiful place. I think I'm going to go read now...  Bye...",
    "Haha, I changed it again. Wow, this is fun. Wheeee. OK, I think I'm definitely having WAY too much fun.",
    "I got a new template. It's an ok template, but I love the name of it. \"Aliens Stole My Wallet.\" Haha, I guess I'm easily amused.",
    "Life seems pretty good right now. I have a lot of homework, but other than that, life seems good. I think I'm going out later. YaY! I'm not spending my Saturday night alone.",
    "So, I went to Michaels to get my shirt for Chemistry and the whole Ty-Dyeing thng. I wanted to get a long sleeved one, but I couldn't find one. :( Oh well, such is life. I wonder what I'll do tonight...",
    "Diane-Orange Derek-Red Kelly-Red Matthew-Orange Kristen-Orange Joanne-Yellow Mary Clare-Sky blue Brett-Blue Emily-Yellow Dave-Sepia Bryan-Bright yellow Chris-Orange Brandon-Green Me-Brown  I wanted to remember what color everyone has said so far, so I'm writing them down.",
    "Haha. Wow, I was SUCH a loser as a child. It amazes me. I'm still a loser, but man....  Alphabetizing crayons. Wow. Psh.",
    "I'm glad I'm secure enough with myself to be able to stay at home on a Friday night without feeling bad.",
    "OK, so, I've come to the conclusion that if I were a crayon, I'd be brown. I feel bad for the brown crayon. Nobody likes the brown crayon except a few. No one really respects the brown crayon. They all need it at one point or another though, to draw a tree or brown hair, and they don't realize how useful the brown crayon is. Really, how many times have you really thought how much the brown crayon is used? And yet, no one likes it. The brown crayon will probably explode someday from so many rejections, and it will be terrible. All the little kids always go for the pretty colors. Blue, purple, pink, but it's not the appearence of the crayon so much. It's how useful it is. What it does. The brown crayon is helpful, and is always there even though all the kids reject it.   I get philisophical when I'm tired....or just very weird. :)",
    "Things have actually been going ok this week. The week is going by really fast thankfully, but I know next week will drag by SO MUCH! I don't really feel like typing anything right now, so...maybe I'll write more later. I have to go make my dinner anyway.",
    "I miss Victoria. I miss how she would always come when I called her. I miss how she'd do anything for me. I miss how she would sleep with me every night. I miss how she would only come for me, and how she only liked me. I miss how everyone would say, \"Catie, go get Victoria, you're the only one who can get her.\" I miss how she ALWAYS sensed when I was sad, from anywhere in the house and would come find me to cheer me up. I miss my cat. MY cat. She was truly mine, and she loved me. She loved me for what I am. She didn't want to change me. She didn't want to make me any different at all. She loved me for being me.   I don't miss that I found her lying on the floor dead. What a horrible way to lose something you love SO much. I really miss her. She'd be hear listening to me, crying with me, cuddling with me. I can't believe I'm letting myself think about it again. After I found her lying there, motionless, I wouldn't let myself think of it. I couldn't. :( Why am I doing this to myself? Crying wont make her come back. The one thing that truly loved me and was completely devoted to me.  Feels like I just fell face forward and a piece of that glass was wedged into my heart.",
    "I would love people to just answer this question honestly. What's wrong with me? Why can't I seem to get anyone to like me other than Matt? Really? I don't understand. I really don't. I think I'm a pretty decent person, but maybe I'm just fooling myself. Maybe I've been fooling myself all the time. I'm never going to find someone. Never. There's not even one person who's remotely interested in me. Everyone seems to find someone, and I get to hear all about it, and...heh. Wow. I love that people trust me, and tell me stuff but...I guess, it just hurts when I realize that no one's talking about me to someone. No one likes me, has ever liked me, or will ever like me.   Right now, the glass is not just half empty, it's empty and shattered.",
    "So, what to do, what to do. I don't know. I don't even know what I'm thinking. Life seems very confusing right now. Michigan. Michigan. Michgan. I just need to keep thinking of it, and I'll be happy. :)",
    "Haha. OK, so Angie and I made up a good analogy.  Abstinence is like Thanksgiving dinner. You don't eat anything all day because you know dinner will be really really good.  YaY for abstinence!",
    "My head says no but my heart says yes. I can't follow my heart though. It will end in pain and humiliation. I know it will.",
    "Even if I did like him, there's nothing I would ever do about it. Why am I such a chicken?",
    "They say this is the best time of your life, and I don't necessarily doubt it but there's some pretty crappy stuff that goes along with it.",
    "OK, so, I'm super tired, and super anxious to get back to reading my good book right now so, I'm remindng myself to write about this stuff later.  -My day -Cleaning out my locker/after school adventure -Tyler -Going to Finding Nemo -Kathryn's little outburst at the boys in the car  :)",
    "I still can't even fathom what he did to his first girlfriend.",
    "I'm actually surprised at how angry I am. I mean, I am....extremely angry. Angrier than words can express. Wasn't it enough to do that to one person? Now you want to ruin someone else?  Heh, another problem. I can't be around her if she's with him. I wouldn't be able to stand it. I'd want to kill something or someone.",
    "AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Darnit, thanks for ruining everything you jerk. Thanks a lot.",
    "I must say, it really makes me sick. Really really really. And she's being dragged into it. I think she's caving in and there's not a gosh darn thing I can do about it. Even if I were to tell her what a slime he is, and what he did to his old girlfriend, she wouldn't listen. She thrives on going against what people tell her. She would just probably go out with him faster or something. ARGH! Seriously, this all makes me sick. Incredibly sick.  He's going to hurt her like he hurt his last girlfriend. Man, that kids probably going to be an abusive husband someday, but the problem is, he seems ok normally, but he's so impulsive, and argh. Abusive relationship. He's going to hurt her. I can see it now, but she wants someone so much that she'll go for him. AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH. This is so bad, and it really really truly bothers me.   On a happier note, I talked to Joanne on the phone for a long time tonight. It was so nice. Ah, I love her! But, I just can't get this other thing out of my head. He's going to hurt her, and not just emotionally, but probably physically too. He's going to ruin her, crush her, strip her of her dignity. And in the end, I know I'll be right, but it wont feel good to say, \"I told you so.\" Whenever I'm so rarely right, it's bad if in the end it wont feel good to say that. Sure everyone deserves second chances, but he had so many with her. SO many. Argh.   I need to sleep.....",
    "Haha, I just realized I wrote \"my kelly's\" like they're mine! haha! Alllll mine!",
    "OK, I've decided. I'm not letting myself lose touch with my really good friends like my kelly's and Joanne and Kathryn, and Emily and stuff. No way no how. I'm just not going to let it happen. I'm determined! HMPH!",
    "OK, so, I've had a vision!!! I see the light! Ahhh!  OK, so when Kelly becomes rich and famous, and I go to one of her concerts, and then try to get backstage, the guards will yell at me and be like, \"GET AWAY YOU WHITE HAIRED NUTCASE!\" And I'll be like, \"But I know her!!!\" And they'll laugh in my face, and then Kelly will come up and say, \"Catie my love,\" and I'll laugh REALLY HARD into the guards faces. Ahahahahaha. It shall be fun.",
    "As pathetic as this song is musically, I still love it...  So we talked all night about the rest of our lives Where we're gonna be when we turn 25 I keep thinking times will never change Keep on thinking things will always be the same  When we leave this year we wont be comin' back No more hangin' out 'cause we're on a different track And if you got somethin' that you need to say You better say it right now 'cause you don't have another day  'Cause we're movin' on and we can't slow down These memories are playin' like a film without sound And I keep thinkin' of the night in June I didn't know much of love but it came too soon  And there was me and you And then we got real blue Stayed at home talkin' on the telephone We'd get so excited and we'd get so scared Laughing at ourselves thinkin' life's not fair  And this is how it feels As we go on We remember All the times  We had together And as our lives change Come whatever  We will still be friends forever  So if we get the big jobs and we make the big money When we look back now will our jokes still be funny Will we still remember everything we learned in school Still be tryin to break every single rule  Will little brainy bobby be the stock broker man Can anna find a job that wont interfere with her tan I keep, keep thinkin that it's not goodbye Keep on thinkin it's a time to fly  And this how it feels As we go on We remember All the times We had togetther And as our lives change Come whatever We will still be friends forever  Will we think about tomorrow like we think about now Can we survive it our there Can we make it somehow I guess the thought that this would never end And suddenly it's like we're women and men Will the past be a shadow that will follow us round Will these memeories fade when I leave this town I keep thinkin that it's not goodbye I keep on thinkin it's a time to fly  As we go on We remember All the times  We had together And as our lives change come whatever We will still be Friends forever",
    "Yeah, so, Im kind of sad. It was the seniors last day today, and I don't even really know any seniors, but it just makes me think how much closer I'm coming to being a senior and leaving and having to go off on my own, and not seeing my friends anymore. Then, of course, it reminds me of next year where not only do I lose my best friend, but other very close friends. I'll luckily still have awesome friends senior year, but...I'm still going to miss my friends leaving after next year. I think I'm most worried about Chris. I can talk to him so easily, and spend time with him alone without any pressure, and....I feel so comfortable around him. I'm worried that after he goes to college, I wont ever see him, nonetheless talk to him. This is why I truely despise getting a specific best friend. They leave at some point, or you grow apart, or something. It's the same thing that happened with Christy and Amanda, and....well, Kelly will always be my friend. No matter where we are. She is the one person I am positive I will keep in contact with after High School. I have complete faith in that. I've known her for so long, and she's just Kelly. I know we'll talk at least periodically to each other throughout the rest of our lives. I know I'll go to her wedding, and well, hopefully not her funeral. Everyone else, I'm not so sure. I hardly talk to Christy anymore, and Amanda, the only reason I really talk to her is because my mom's best friends with her mom. I still do love them, and would still take a bullet for each of them, but...I just don't talk to them as much. Then my other really close friends...Kelly C., I think our lives will go in completely different directions, and we'll grow apart. I'll be there for her when she becomes a famous clarinet player in the CSO, but I have a feeling after High School, we wont talk as much. Kathryn, I don't really know what will happen. I think we'll try to keep in contact, but just end up growing apart. Like, the calls will somehow end up being few and far between. Emily, oh...I don't know. If she actually does go to Europe, that's the end. Keeping in touch with someone on another continent is really difficult. I hope for her sake she does get to go though. Joanne's already going off to England, and who knows what will happen with that. And....just, wow. I need to stop thinking about this, and my other close friends. I haven't even really talked about any of my guy friends. I'm stopping myself now.  I hate this. I've had such a great blessed life. It's just hard for me to accept change at all.   Tell me that we belong together....  And I'll be your crying shoulder...  Drat. I've managed to truely bum myself out.   :( Things just seem so sad right now.",
    "What scares me most, is that I wouldn't be surprised if that happened....  Haha, I love talking when no one has any idea what I'm saying.",
    "I miss my cat. No, no, no, no, no, not now. I'm not thinking of her now. Nope, I'll start to cry. I've managed to push it to the back of my mind and force it to stay there, and that's what I'm going to keep doing.",
    "What do you do when the only person who likes you is the only person you truely dislike?  He's the only person I'll ever get to like me, and I can't even like him one bit. JEEZ! Figures.",

    "I've been writing more and more in here lately. I wonder why. *Sigh* I don't know what's up with me. I mean, I'm happy...but, I'm sad at the same time. I feel like I'm missing something.

    "I was looking at some of my very fisrt blog entries. Wow, I've really changed a lot. It sort of amazes me. Anyway, I found this somewhere in there, and I want to re-post it so that I keep remembering it.   Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking. It is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil, but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails. -1 Corinthians 13:4-8  :) I love it. I love the Bible. I love God!!! Sometimes, I think people think I'm some heathen atheistic person, and I'm completely not. It's completely the other way around. I just like to worship God in my own way, and my own way is a quiet way. I don't like to push my views on other people. People who try to push their views on others really bother me. I love God, and have complete faith in him. That's all I need to know. If other people don't believe that, nothing I say will change their minds. That's why I don't understand why so many wars are faught over God. Don't you realize you're doing what God doesn't want you to do?? You're killing, and  argh. Has this war over God ever been resolved?? No, because not everyone worships God in the same way or worships him at all. It bothers me so much. Let people believe what they want to believe.   Wow, ok...sorry, venting.",

    "AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!! I am SO stressed right now. So so so very stressed. I'm so sick of him. So sick of him. He does everything he possibly can to annoy me. It's like he trys to. It's like he wakes up in the morning and thinks of ways to make me mad.   I just went online and realized that there's no way I can have a conversation with anyone right now. It's stupid to even consider trying, it really is. I'm just going to say something I don't mean or something. Argh. I feel so low and terrble and...lonely. I know I have awesome friends, but I guess I just feel lonely right now. I guess it's normal. Everyone's allowed to feel lonely. Heh, I feel lonely, yet at the same time, I want to be left alone. I don't want to see anyone at school tomorrow. Maybe a few people, but not most. I want people to just leave me alone at school tomorrow. Not talk to me, not nag me, poke me, tease me. None of that. I want to see only a few people like my lunch gang, and them.   I wish I could see Amanda. Man, I miss her so much. I wish she hadn't moved to Texas. :( I wish I could see Heather too. If she's changed some of her ways, I want to see her a lot this summer. Argh. Is today over yet? Is tomorrow over yet? Heh, I'm not exactly following my quote, \"never let the sunset on tomorrow before the sun rises today.\"  I had a really strange dream the other night. I'm not sure if it was good or not. It was with someone I'm really close to. I don't know. It was weird. I guess i'm still analyzing it. Who knows? I just need to do this speech crap so that I can go read and sleep.

    "Yes! Finally! This wasn't working before for some odd reason, and it was making me mad. Man, I feel so sick. My tummy really really hurts. :( Stupud guys. Seriously, they NEVER have to deal with anything. Grrr.   So, today was an ok day. Only 4 more days of actual class. Wind Ensemble, I went to the writing center and actually worked on my speech outline. I was amazed, I actually did work. Then, music theory, gosh, I want to get away from that class SO SO SO much. Seriously. Yuck. Oh well. He just talked, and talked, and talked, and blah bah blah!!!!! Argh. It seriously didn't end. Chemistry was ok. We just got a ton of really confusing notes. Argh. Poo on Mr. K. Sometimes he's ok, but sometimes I just want to choke him. RAR! Ummm, Health was ok. Really boring and pointless. Busy work. Grr. We wrote stories with 15-25 words we found in the chapter. It was really very pointless. Speech was ok. I didn't have to give my speech. Someone else gave a speech on Plastic Surgery though so...yikes. Oh well. Umm, lunch was ok. Math was boring. I think I actually understood what we were doing though. Government, we just watched 12 Angry Men.  It was really a pretty boring day, and I think I'll go work on my speech now so I can go eat dinner and go read, and then go to sleep early. Wow, that would be nice. OK, Byebye.",
    "Goodmorning. I really hope today goes well and that I don't have to give my speech and that Mr. A isn't there. You kinow, something just occurred to me...if Alstadt were to ever by some chance read this, A.) I'd never have a chance of making WE again or B.)I'd feel terrible or actually...both! Yikes. Maybe I need to stop writing about Alstadt in here. I know I wont because he makes me mad a lot, but...maybe I can try to talk about him less. Anyway, I'm off to school. YaY? Byebye!",
    "OH MY GOSH OH MY GOSH OH MY GOSH! BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD IMAGES!!!  Ewwwww!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   I think I'm going to be ill...",
    "I'm really worried. I haven't talked to Alex lately. I don't want to lose him as a friend. He's such an awesome person. I don't ever want to stop talking to him.",
    "Haha, you know what phrase I've always liked? \"Shifty character.\" Haha, so funny. :)",
    "Hey, I finished my music theory composition! YES!!!! I finished one thing on my list! How awesome is that??? I never called *boy* I swear I was going to, but I couldn't work up the courage. OK, so, I wasn't going to. I can't do it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I talked to a cool kid on the phone anyway, so...it was overall an ok Sunday evening.",
    "Hmmm, you know, it's kind of funny. I never realized how little I mention my dad. I was talking to someone on the phone tonight, and they asked me where my dad was, like as if he were gone or something. Kind of funny. My dad's a cool guy. I really get along with him. I just get along with my family in general. they're cool. I mean, I don't talk to my dad about personal stuff like I do with my mom, but...I still talk to him. Anyway, I think I should go quickly get some research for my final speech and whatnot, then I'm off to bed, so tired! Byebye....",
    "Things to do:  -Finish music theory composition -Finish...or, start my final speech and do the outline for it -Go outside and play basketball for a little bit -Have a cookie...with milk. -Call *Boy* :) (Like this one will EVER happen) -Get over the fact that it's NOT SUMMER YET! -Buy new earings -Stop writing in blog to avoid homework and doing most of these things!!  I'll add more as I think of more later.   Man, thinking about everything though....life is really good.",
    "AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I loathe homework with the deep burning passion of a thousand fiery suns!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",
    "Man, I am SO avoiding homework. Grrrr. I don't want to do it soooo very much. I'm finishing my music theory thing and it bites. I loathe music theory with a burning passion. I shouldn't have taken it. I don't fit in. I suck at writing music, and I suck at music in general. Grrrr. Oh well. My patience is wearing thin with someone right now. It's getting harder and harder for me not to get angry with him for even little things. He's aggravating me so much, and he just...really knows how to make me mad. It's almost like he works on it or something. Oh well, I'm out of here like the fat kid in dodgeball. Poor fat kid. :(",
    "Yep, I've decided. Definitely. Funny how spending just an hour and a half with your girl friends can make things seem so SO clear. So, that is what I did this evening. I went to Kathryn's house. We just hung out and whatnot. It was a lot of fun. I love being with them. Kelly wasn't there, but oh well. Things were fun just the same. Then after that, I got to drive! YaY! It was fun. Anyway, I'm kind of tired, so...I'm going to bed now, I think, hopefully, if no one IM's me. If someone IM's me...it's all over. I'm so addicted to AIM. Oh well, such is life.",
    "OK, I can stop pretending to clean. Man, why am I so scared of bugs? I saw this little ant, it wasn't hurting anyone, but it was coming close to me and I started FLIPPING out. I grabbed some Fantastik, and sprayed the little thing to death. Well, now I feel incredibly bad, but bugs scare me SO SO SOO much. Anything with ore than 4 legs scares me. It's just not natural to have more than 4. Like...centipedes. *Shiver* I don't even want to think about this actually.   So, anyway, I think I'm going to Kathryn's tonight, yay! So, I should probably go eat dinner and get ready for that and whatnot.   :)  I'm quite content right now.",
    "I don't know why I'm so excited to go to Michigan, but I am. I can't wait. I was talking with Lauren last night, and we were talking about partying and stuff, and I really want to. I mean...REALLY want to. I just want to have some fun and let loose, but I promised myself I'd never drink and stuff. Stupid promises. I don't even know why I do, I just really want to have fun. I'm sure I can have fun without drinking anyway. Sometimes, I guess I just want to be included in it all. I wanted to go with Pat and his friends and my brother when they all invited me a few months ago. It would have been awesome, hanging out with older people, but I didn't because I knew they'd drink and get high and stuff. I know they'll all be doing it, but at least Conor doesn't drink, so maybe I'll hang out with him when they're all drinking and stuff. I asked Max if he could bring up some non-drinking/single/non-attracting Sara guy. Heh, he said that wasn't possible with the Sara part. Heh. Anyway, haha, I thought part of my conversation with Lauren was quite amusing so I'm puting it in here.   Lokiluna13 (11:24:21 PM): hey, I'm a ruel breaker all the way Lokiluna13 (11:24:29 PM): I do drugs all the time and drink baby bear 321 (11:25:37 PM): hahahaha baby bear 321 (11:25:44 PM): can i quote that? Lokiluna13 (11:25:56 PM): lol baby bear 321 (11:26:00 PM): thats soooo goin in my profile Lokiluna13 (11:26:08 PM): I do!! Lokiluna13 (11:26:12 PM): haha baby bear 321 (11:26:35 PM): lemme guess baby bear 321 (11:26:43 PM): u drink pop and u take advil?? Lokiluna13 (11:26:58 PM): yeah...but....both at once, and I'm telling you, you're NOT supposed to do that. Lokiluna13 (11:27:02 PM): It's dangerous!  Haha, it just makes me laugh, but anyway, we've got plans. Big plans. We're going to get the guys back this year. We just have to think of some really really good prank to use. Ahahaha. We will. We're also going to go pick up some yokels. It will be VERY amusing.   Eek, must go. Have to pretend I'm cleaning. I'll probably write more later.",
    "I told Chris there was one thing I was positive about with Ryan last night, but...I'm not so sure anymore....",
    "It's like a game with us. A neverending game and I'm so sick of it. Three years of games.",
    "I am so in love I am so in hate I just can't comprehend it, uh You get me so high You get me so low I can't show what I'm feelin' Never was the type To let someone like You get under my skin, no Tried like hell but you Didn't care for real You stepped on my feelings  See I love to love you boy And I love to hate you But I got to let you know I'ma have to let you go See I love to love you boy And I love to hate you But I got to let you know I'ma have to let you go  Love to feel the love Love to heal from pain Is there really a difference? Wonder who is right Wonder who is wrong I'm just feeling some tension, uh You can't compromise We can't coincide We should really be chillin' 'Cause I've wasted so much time Love is on the line I've made my decision Yeah  It's useless to try and work things out Don't need all of the stress You're not worth it I'm tired of all the ups and downs So goodbye, I'm leaving Made up my mind  See I love to love you boy And I love to hate you But I got to let you know I'ma have to let you go See I love to love you boy And I love to hate you But I got to let you know I'ma have to let you go  It's useless to try and work things out Don't need all of the stress You're not worth it I'm tired of all the ups and downs So goodbye, I'm leaving Made up my mind  See I love to love you boy And I love to hate you But I got to let you know I'ma have to let you go See I love to love you boy And I love to hate you But I got to let you know I'ma have to let you go",
    "Well, I finished my letter to Ryan, now to give it to him? Do I? Don't I? I really don't know.",
    "Boys are stupid, don't throw rocks at them, throw huge giant shards of glass!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Haha...wow...I'm looooony. looony loony!!!",
    "Whooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!! I'm crazy, loony, psycho. I've definitely reached the highlands. Man, they say you need drugs and alcohol to get a buzz, I say just stay up extremely late! WHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!  Hahahahahahaha. Goodnight, goodnight!",
    "I don't know anything at all and I'm somebody else It could take years to find you, it could years to find myself And I don't need to hear your answer I just need you to see That I think it's time to break down these walls that we throw  Am I still breathing have I lost that feeling Am I made of glass 'cause you see right through me I don't know who I am and you're the only one who sees that I can't ask these questions that cannot be answered today And even if everything goes wrong and we start to fall apart I will understand where you are, I will understand this by myself And I don't need to hear your answer I just need you to feel Like there are no boundaries at all  And how far have we come, too far to throw away the past Will you be there waiting for me I have to ask what we are, if I ask today it just won't last So I'll be here waiting for you  Will we ever feel this good again - Not today  Will we ever feel this real again - Not today  Will you ever be mine again - Not today  Will we ever feel this real again - Not today     Stupid world. People suck.",
    "I had a very good very...interesting day. I don't think I want to write about it in here though. I was going to but I think I've decided against it.",
    "Haha. One more person I found out about who reads this thing. Eek. I really really need to be careful what I write. I guess it really doesn't matter since this is sort of my diary, and since I don't write anything in here that's too personal anyway   Luckily though, I CAN write about Ryan, because he never reads this.  I'm worried about tomorrow. At first I was supposed to go to Great America with him all day, but...I decided not to since there were tons of people I know going there, and I didn't want to see people I knew all day long. So, then we decided we'd do something else like bowling or a movie or something, but...I'm having second thoughts. I think if I do see him, I'll start liking him...again. I realllly don't want that, because a relationship with us just doesn't work. I obviously broke up with him for a reason last time. Why bother puting myself through that again? It just hurt me and him, and it took a while to get our friendship back. But, I guess I'm not really being a friend to him if I don't want to see him. I know if I do, I'll end up going out with him at the end of the day, and yeah...I've thought about doing that, but...it's partly because I just want to be in a relationship with someone. Hmmm, oh well. Tonight was fun. I went to Peter's party. It was excellent...well, I guess. It was alright, but I didn't know anyone, and Chris and Brandon went to play video games. Luckily, Kelly was there, and Annie too. I'm glad I'm friends with those two. Hmmm, so I left the party kind of early and just hung out with Chris for a bit. It was cool.   That's really about it. I guess I'm just really worried about this thing tomorrow. I felt like I was being a jerk to Chris. I was listening to him, just...not all there. Sigh. I guess what wants to happen will happen. I shall see, I shall see.",
    "YaY! OK, so, my day...  I slept in since I had my lunch final, and I went in late and went to take my government final. I'm glad I didn't bother studying for it. I got a 97% on it. That rocks so much. I wasn't sure whether or not to study, so, I didn't. Sweet. So, after that, Kelly, Joanne, John, Kathryn, Mary Clare, and I all went out to lunch. We went to THREE, count 'em, THREE! restaurants. The first two were just too full, so we ended up going to Einsteins. I wanted to get a peanut butter and jelly bagel, but I thought that I should wait til I was with Diane haha.  Sometimes I feel like Diane doesn't like me very much, like...I annoy her for some reason, or she doesn't trust me for some reason. I feel like I should say sorry to her, but I don't think I did anything. I'd love to be better friends with her, but I don't think she wants to. Oh well, I'm not giving up yet. Anyway...after we went to Einsteins, we went paddle boating. It was so fun. Haha. It was a little chilly, but still tons and tons of fun. Oh, I wouldn't suggest ever trying to switch with someone in the backseat, especially when you have four people in your boat. Good times, good times. Hmmm, then we went to Starbucks, but I don't like coffee, so I just got a fruit drink thing. Yum yum yum. Then Kathryn's mommy picked us up, and drove us to joanne's. we just hung out for a while. We did Karaoke, haha. We also played spoons, except...we used forks. Yikes. It's really dangerous. I cut myself. :( But, Joanne gave me an Elmo band aid so it's all good. The Elmo bandaid completely made my day.   I'm pretty sure we managed to make Kathryn mad. I think she's hiding it because she didn't want to ruin our good time, but I am pretty sure something we did got her mad. Oh well. Tonight, I'm going to Peter's party thing. I wasn't sure I wanted to go but so many people are going, so I figure I should give it a shot. Maybe I'll have a blast. Eek, I hope. So, Chris is driving me there in like an hour or so, or something. Heh. Fun day. Tomorrow will be good too. I'm probably hanging out with Ryan the entire day.  :)   Yes, tomorrow will DEFINITELY be good. We decided not to go to Great America since so many people I know are going.   Anyway, I think I'm off to do something...errr, constructive?  HAHA NOT! And why not? Because there's NO SCHOOL! WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!",
    "Today was so dull and boring I don't even really want to write about it. Heh. Oh well, tomorrow will be fun at least.",
    "My day was excellent, superb, wonderful! I was really dreading it. Honestly, this was maybe my easiest day, but I was still dreading it. Why? Because of meany pooface Alstadt. He's such a jerk sometimes. I'm sorry, but he is. Anyway, I just sat around before school IN THE BAND ROOM! I couldn't believe it was open. Heh, funny. It was open and guess who wasn't there? Anyway, I went to go take my speech final, and it was easy and all. I got a B on it without studying at all. It's ok. I'll still get an A in the class. I could have gotten a 68% on it.Excellent. Anyway...I did that, then went to band. Since we took the band final on Friday, there was nothing to do. I KNEW if I stayed Id' have to sort commencement music since we had to let it all dry out yesterday. So, Kelly and I decided to be rebels! WOO HOO! We walked to burger king and got some food. It was awesome. We got kids meals, and we got the toys that went along with them! It rocked! So, then we walked back, and no one seemed to notice. :) Excellent. Alstadt took attendance, but...no big deal. They aren't going to come after me with two days of school left. Also, my parents wouldn't care anyway. So, then, unfortunately, we had to go to music theory. It wasn't as bad as I thought. I proved Alstadt wrong though! YES! He said I couldn't go from A major to C major and have it sound good. HA! Not like my composition was good, but it still sounded ok, and Mr. A was wrong!!! WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!  Anyway, that was pretty much it today. Oh yeah, with our kids meals, Kelly and I got these scratch and sniff thing. Oh my gosh, there was one with a foot, and it smelled SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO bad. Wow! Terrible.   Anyway, I'm done. I think I'll go...I don't know, do someonething constructive?",
    "So, kind of a depressing day.  I woke up at about 10, couldn't find my shoes, searched alll over the house and finally found them. So, I go take my shower thinking, \"lalala, everything is good. I found my shoes.\" OK, maybe not. I find out my dress had a rip in it!! GRRR, so, I had to have my mommy fix that really fast, and I actually got there on time. We actually had to have commencement outside. Luckily we got to go in after we finished playing though. The poor seniors didn't. I really am surprised they didn't have the ceremony inside. Oh well. So, our music got ruined, my hair/dress/feet all got SOAKED! ahhh. Oh well. So, after that I unexpectedly got a ride home from Chris, changed into some dry clothes, and then we went to Chipotle and met Brandon and Bryan there. It was a lot of fun. I actually got something there. I've never actually had food there. It's so yummy. Mmmmm. I definitely couldn't finish it all though. So, yeah, then we went to Coldstone. I got chocolate ice cream with gummy bears. Yum. So very good. Then Chris and I just drove around and talked for a bit, and then, I came home, and I started to study for math, but I just couldn't do it, so...I decided to write. Haha. Lala. So, that was my exciting day.   It's kind of funny when someone who's your friend thinks if they tell you something they're thinking, you're going to hate them or something, and then they tell you, and you don't at all. It wasn't what you were expecting, because you were expecting to actually be mad at them but you aren't at all. And it just makes you love them more because they're so honest and truthful, and they trust you so much. I feel really trustworthy right now, and that's all I have to say. I'm sure no one has any clue what I'm talking about. Sorry. Oh well, I don't think anyone reads this anyway, do they? Oh well, no more talk of this ever.  I must be off to study. HA, like that'll happen.",
    "Argh. Tonight so many things are hurting me. I feel like my heart has been ripped apart so many times tonight. Like, it was ripped apart, and started healing, then ripped apart again. It hurts so much.",
    "So yeah...I just love being the one not paired up with anyone. Feels fantastic. Really.   I'm a big fat liar.",
    "There's no way I'm letting this bring me down dag nabbit.",
    "I don't know man.  Things just really seem to suck right now. I went out to Pizza Hut tonight with my friends but it just wasn't as fun as I was hoping for. I'm just in such a bad mood, it's hard to have fun. I feel like I'm compltely wasting my summer. I don't know how or why, but...I do. I just feel so mad right now, and sad...  Who knows? Maybe it'll be better tomorrow. :(",
    "Hm, ok....so, everyone left for Germany which kind of stinks but I've been doing tons of stuff!! It's amazing! I'm still writing to Chris and Kelly, and whatnot, but I've been hanging out with all my other friends here. I actually went to the pool yesterday in the middle of the day, and didn't get burned! Well, this one part of my face did because I must have missed it with my sunscreen, but still! I was so happy, and it was fun! Then I went to Kathryn's with Joanne and Kathryn, and we just hung out. It's kind of weird just being with both of them. Oh well. Then, last night I had a sleepover at Joanne's, and it was fun. I actually got a lot of sleep surprisingly. Heh, except it wasn't really good sleep, because sleeping on a florr REALLY hurts. Hmmm, we watched the Princess Bride! I'd never seen it before! It's really really good! YaY! It was fun! Oh, and haha, Joanne really can't take not knowing something. It was so funny. Kathryn said something that we couldn't tell Joanne, and Joanne REALLY wanted to know. It was just humorous. She usually knows everything, and the one thing she didn't drove her crazy. Woo, fun times.  So, today I've just been busy cleaning and whatnot, and tonight I'm going out with Katharine, and Diane, and Steve maybe, and Jeff maybe. It will be most exciting hopefully! :)  I must get going. I've got quite a bit to do actaully.",
    "I really don't think it's ever going to happen. :(",
    "So, my day was pretty ok. I gave my Daddy his gifts and stuff and that was fun, and other than that I really didn't do much. I played the computer game Civilization. Oh my goodness, that game is ADDICTING! Wow. So, anyway, everyone's leaving tomorrow. :( I'm going to miss everyone. A few of my really really good friends are going, and it'll be hard without them here. I doubt they'll miss me at all. Oh well.   Oh yeah! I cleaned my bathroom today too. Blah. I hate cleaning my bathroom. I hate cleaning altogether actually. I hope I'm rich when I get older so I can hire someone else to do that, or I'll try to marry someone who likes to clean. Ha. Like that'll happen. I mean the marrying part, not the finding someone who will clean part. :)   Anyway, talking to kelly. I'm going to miss her. Her and Chris the most. :( I'll write more later....maybe.",
    "You know, it's funny. I seem to like him less and less every day. OK, it's not funny. It's terrible, but really. He makes me so angry, and so mad almost every time I talk to him. Argh. Some people really annoy me.",
    "So, I was looking at my very first blog entry which isn't even on this page, and I just thought...\"wow Catie, you were SUCH a dork.\" Yeah, that entry actually scares me. I wonder if in 7 months I'll think the same thing I did of my Novemeber 14th first entry into one of these. I'm kind of surprised I've actually kept up writing in this. I've never actually kept a real diary. I've always felt like I was just whining to paper. I don't know how this is different, it's just whining to a computer screen, but still....I've kept up with it. I wonder how much longer I'll keep uo with it. I don't intend on stopping writing anytime soon. Hmmm....interesting thoughts. 'Eh, I'm not in much of a reflective mood right now, so I think I'll go read and wait for a good storm to come! :)",
    "Hm, ok, so that was odd. It just started raining a bit, and then it got sunny again, and now cloudy. Weird. I wonder if storms will be coming through all day. I actually like storms as long as they aren't too...errr....deadly...yes, that's it. I usually like to read during storms, like, snuggle up with my blanket and all my stuffed animals and just read and listen to the rain and thunder. It's fun, but...I guess I have a weird definition of fun.   I can't believe they're all coming home Monday. I'm pretty excited, but time here has also gone by extremely fast. I've gotten to hang out with a lot of people, and meet new people, and have a blast. 13 days til Michigan too. Plus, I found out that we're almost positively going to Italy for Thanksgiving this year. I'm SO excited. I love Italy. I really do. It's one of my favorite places in the world. :) And if my mom gets the bonus she might be getting for this thing she's working on...too hard to explain...then we get to fly first class. :) That would be so awesome. First class on an overseas flight. I could actually sleep. Not that coach is all that uncomfortable for a 5'0\" person like myself, but still, that's so awesome. I'm really excited, and I can't wait to go. I think though, that if the marching band goes to the Macy's Day thing, I'll miss it, which would not be cool...but still. I love Rome.   Hmmm, everything's too quiet in my house. I'm going to go check it out. It makes me nervous when my house is quiet.",
    "I was having a chat with someone this evening, and they asked me if I cried a lot. It was kind of funny...seeing as I almost never cry. Only when it's something really important to me, or when I just bottle everything up, or when I just listen to a gorgeous song, and emotions come. Most of the time, that's when I cry. Music makes me feel emotions I didn't even know I had. It's amazing. Although I don't want to go into it as a career, I am extremely glad it's part of my life, and I love people who can make great music. I truly truly respect it. Ah, anyway, I'm off to sleep...seriously...",
    "Haha, wow...I'm having so much trouble typing tonight. My fingers are being clumsy for some reason. I have to type like every word twice. Grrrr.",
    "Blah, blah, blah!! I'm not tired, and I actually, for once in my life, don't feel like reading. I don't know why I'm not tired at night. I woke up at a resonable hour today. Hmmm, I think I need to stop writing in here like a loser and go talk to my friends. I was talking to like...5 friends, and all the conversations ended at the same time. Poo. haha. Katharine just told me I should go sleep. Yes, yes I should. Will I? Probably not unfortunately. I should really take my friend's advice. They give good advice. On sleeping at least.  I heard Chris and Mike and both Daves were drinking in Germany. It kind of upsets me. Not upsets...but dissapoints. I'm surprised. I mean, I heard they didn't just drink but got drunk. I was especially surprised about one of the Daves. I have talked to him about drinking before, and I asked him if he ever drank, and he was like, \"NO!\" I remember that so well, because it almost seemed as though I'd offended him with the question at the time. Like, \"How could you ask me that? Of course I don't drink you silly girl.\" Ah well, I guess it's their choice, not mine. They can do what they want, but I guess I lost some respect for Dave.  So, I'm off to go talk to cool people because....err...because they're cool. Wheee. I think I'll go to sleep feeling happy. :) Plus, I finished my book, which is nice. I'll need to find a new one though. Ah...I'm off....",
    "Hmmm...I'm debating on whether or not to do this. Probably not. I'm a chicken. A dumb chicken with it's head cut off. I always thought that story about that chicken who lived for like...15 hours after he had his head cut off was interesting...I think it's terrible that someone cut the chicken's head off, but...I still thought it was kind of interesting. I wonder what science is behind that.",
    "You know, I just realized something. I always worried about how people probably think I'm weird because I go to the park and swing on the swings and listen to my music when I need to think. Well, I don't care. Everyone has a place that they think in, and that just happens to be mine. I don't even know why. It just relaxes me. It helps me filter my thoughts.

That's not really my kind of movie. I didn't even really like the first one that much. So, I decided I didn't want to pay money for something I didn't really want to see all that much in the first place. Oh well, a night in with myself isn't bad. Wheee...",

I want to talk to one of them, and I can't without emailing them and waiting hours and hours for a response. *Sigh* Monday...come sooner!!!!!!!! :(  I'm just frustrated right now...obviously.",
    "Sooo, today I'm just going out with my family and whatnot. It'll be a good time. It always is. I also have to clean my room if I want to get my new furniture. My mom's good at coming up with bribes. Grrr. Ah well. I'm off.",
    "Wow. I have a darn good life. An extremely extremely good life, and I'm just so happy about it. It kind of scares me sometimes too though, like...I'm too lucky. Like, eventually my luck will run out and terrible things will happen. Ah, who knows? I guess all I can do is be thankful for what I have now, and pray that it continues.  Hmmm, moving on to goofy mode. Wow, I'm such a loser. I get so weird at night. I should look into this. It's got to be something about the brain late at night. :)   Oh...and gummy bears taste delectible at 2:22 in the morning.",
    "OK, so I didn't sleep. So what? Haha. It doesn't matter anymore. I'm not going to Joanne's again tomorrow. Haha, oh well. We WILL watch it sometime. I'm determined now. We've set the date for July 9th now lol. It'll happen...sooner or later. Probably later, but it will still happen.  Hmmm, so, I'm talking to this kid right now. He seems really cool actually. And that's all I'm saying. Yes, that's definitely all I'm saying. Haha. So, I'm going to go finish talking to people and go read or something since I'm not particularily tired.",
    "Heh. OK, as of right now, I've decided on neither. Both are out. Hehe. Wow, that leaves me right where I started at. Dag nabbit. This is pooey, and so is my computer, it doesn't like me much. But what does? :) Tra la la, I had my grilled cheese earlier. It was yummy, and tonight I'm having chicken parmigan. Hmmm, I wonder how you spell parmigan...  Oh well. I think I'm going to I don't know...go be a loser someplace than on my blogger website.",
    "Hmmm, so, I was supposed to go to Joanne's, but she couldn't since she's got to do a lot of work on her mom's closet still. That's ok with me actually. I'm not feeling great anyway. It's just one of those, \"blah\" days. I think I'll probably go make myself some grilled cheese, and just, read my book or watch tv. YaY! Mmmm.....grilled cheese. I'm so addicted to that stuff. I really am. I think I need to get on a better sleeping schedule, but even if I do, I'll go off it again in MI. So, I guess there really isn't much of a point, because I refuse to go to bed at 9 every night when I go. Tra la la. I'm in a weird mood. Quite a weird mood. Hmmm, I just flung my pony tail thing across the room...Wow, I'm so weird. There's nothing really to type about. I still havem't decided, although I did find something out that could be helpful. Eh, I think I should just forget everything and wait til college. YaY college. Maybe there will be mature guys there. I hope....Joanne's lucky, but it's funny. I don't know how they are going to be apart a whole year next year. Joanne really misses him and it's only a week that he's gone now.I have faith in them though. I think they're going to be one of those high school couples that makes it, and actually stays together. They're like, made for each other. I'm really happy for both of them. :) Anyway, I think I'm going to go make my grilled cheese now, and read or something. Hmmm, I never sign this thing anymore. Oh well.",
    "I've figured something out. Guys don't like girls like me. They like mysterious girls, or funny girls, or interesting girls, or even girls that seem innocent. Hmmmm. I don't think I want to change myself, but....grrr. It still makes me angry. 16 days...only 16 days. It'll be nice to get away from Naperville. Very nice. I can't wait to go on the jetski's, and go tubing, and.....just lie in the hammock and read. :) So relaxing. *Sigh* ARGH! July 11th, WHY WONT YOU COME SOONER??? Oh well. Such is life. Hehe. Anyway, off to sleep. Nighty night.",
    "Well, at least this thing finally works. I guess I can write a little about my night, but not too much since I want to get some sleep since I'm going to Joanne's at 1:00 tomorrow. Tonight was ok. I was supposed to go out with Erica, Brett, and this kid Roger, but it didn't end up happeneing so I just went to Joanne's instead. Heh. It was alright. We just watched the first Harry Potter movie, and Kathryn kind of ruined part of the fifth book for me. Sadly, I think se did it purposely. Like...the way she said it, and when she did it, it felt like she knew exactly what she was saying. Kelly and I obviously weren't too happy. Oh well. It was still ok. Everything with Diane is all good now! :) I'm so happy it is, because I just...I don't know, things were awkward for a bit I guess.  Man, everyone seems so aggravated and irritated lately. It's weird. It's like everyone needs a vacation from each other. Like everyone needs to get away. I don't know, it's just odd. Man, I wish my mommy were home. I need to talk to her about this decision I'm trying to make. I don't know. I kind of wish I had someone who I could talk to about this, but...there are very few people I trust, and even them, it's not easy to talk about people I like with...  I guess we'll see what happens. I'm thinking of making a list of why I like both, and then deciding, but that just seems so...I don't know. I feel like I should know. I feel like I should feel in my heart which one's right. I guess....  Who knows?  I think I just need sleep. I was absolutely looony five minutes ago haha. I guess I've gotten into serious conversation with the person I'm talking to so I've gotten more serious, but I love when I can be goofy. I love just feeling silly and not caring what other people think. Woooo.   Anyway, I think I'm just going to go to sleep soon, maybe read a few pages of my book. Not Harry Potter. Ahh....byebye! :)",
    "Argh.....I wrote a whole thing and blogger was dumb, and didn't publish it.",
    "Hmmmm. Well, I just don't know now...I talk to one, and think I've decided but then talk to the other. Argh. I don't like making choices.",
    "I miss my cat. :( I really miss her. I wish she were here. She's be right by my side too. I could tell her stuff.",
    "So, I just went out with my mom and stuff today. It was fun. I found the furniture set I think I want, but it doesn't have the bed I want! Grrr!  I love it other than that, so...I'm thinking I'll probably get that set, and get an unfinished bed and paint it a fun color, or finish it in the color of the other furniture. Sooo, I'm going out again soon and I'm trying to decide whether I want to actually dress in something nice. I think I might just stick with my comfy pants. I love them. :) They make me happy.   Hmmm, It's only been 12 days since summer started...wow. It seems like a LOT longer. It hasn't even been two weeks. Yay though!! I'm looking forward to Michigan SO SO much!!!!!!!!!!!! AHHHH! I seriously can't wait. Not only am I going to get to see people I don't get to see often, but I'm going to read Harry Potter too :) YaY!!! Hmmm, this is being dumb so...it's not posting it. Oh well, I'm sure it will eventually. Blogger is weird....",
    "Wow, I really hope she forgives me. I did have fun with her, and I just happened to be in a bad mood. I even asked her if we could go to Great America sometime this summer. I don't know. I feel so bad. I'm sorry diane. I'm really truly sorry. It wasn't you, it was my bad mood and I'm sorry I took it out on you. That's what I'm going to tell her. I think that she'll understand. I think she knows what it's like to have a bad few days. I hope she does at least.",
    "Ohhh great, now Diane thinks I'm mad at her because of Pizza Hut and whatnot... :( It wasn't that I didn't have fun at Pizza Hut, it's that I was just in such a bad mood beforehand...that, I just didn't even really let myself have a good time. Oh well. I'll call her later and apologize. I didn't mean to bring my bad mood down on her, and I really did appreciate that she invited me. That was probably the one good thing about that day. Oh well, I'll talk to her and apologize and hopefully she'll forgive me.",

    "Sorry for not writing for a while, but I've had a pretty busy weekend. I discovered I have around 20 tests on Tuesday because my teachers are cruel...but what can you do? We had marching practice yesterday. It was great because we stayed inside the whole time, and I got to play the second part, making the music portion quite easy.\n\nI left marching early around 5:00 and went out for dinner with my friends, as I had already made plans before knowing about the practice. Dinner was a blast because it was Kelly's birthday, which made it extra special. Afterward, we went to Kelly's place for a sleepover, did a lot of fun activities, and I ended up sleeping earlier than usual since I had to attend a Bar Mitzvah this morning. It was an interesting experience.\n\nFor a project in CR, we need to visit two different places of worship outside our own religion. One visit will be to a Jewish synagogue, and I’m considering a mosque for the other, but I haven't decided yet. This has been my only chance to write, and I actually have to go now, so I'll write more later...maybe.\n\n*Ya di amore*",
    "Today was alright, despite a late start. I'm not really in the mood to write much, but I might end up writing a lot anyway, as I usually do. There wasn't anything particularly exciting in my classes, and I only chatted with a few close friends, including someone I refer to as \"You know who.\" But actually, you don't know who that is. Not that it matters since no one reads this stuff. I managed to reach the top of the rock climbing wall today. Kelly and I plan to master the entire wall, which should be fun. Jazz was enjoyable as always. So, that's about it. Have a great evening, everyone, I'm heading to bed. (Surprisingly, I didn't write as much as I thought I would.) *Ya di Amore*",
    "Thought: Alright... I'm totally supportive of little people and everything. I'm not like, \"against little people,\" but honestly, wouldn't it be a bit rude to say, \"Hooray for little people?\" ~Ya di amore~",
    "So, it’s later in the day and guess what? My parents decided I needed a “constructive” activity. Yep, you guessed it—cleaning. Ugh, why do parents always think cleaning is the ultimate solution for boredom? It’s beyond annoying. There I was, basking in my peaceful, homework-free zone while soaking in some smooth jazz when suddenly, \"Hey Catie, go clean.\" Classic, right?\n\nLike always, I did my usual routine of saying, \"Yeah sure, fine, I'll clean.\" Spoiler alert: I almost never do. But this time, my mom came upstairs, asking all nicely with that mom-voice she uses to guilt-trip me. So, I begrudgingly trudged downstairs, grabbed the cleaning supplies, and cleaned the bathroom. Yuck! Cleaning is the absolute worst.\n\nHonestly, I feel like I should just marry a rich guy so I can hire a cleaning lady. Seriously, then I could have a cook who makes me my favorite peanut butter sandwiches all the time. Even if I get super duper fat and the guy wants a divorce, it'll be fine because I won’t have signed a prenuptial agreement. Half of the assets? Yes, please! But first, I’d need to master some witchcraft to make any rich guy—or any guy, really—want to marry me. But now you all know my cunning plan, so back to the drawing board, I guess.\n\nAnyway, I’m just scribbling away because I’m not in the mood to chat with anyone. I wish I could go to the park. It's my sanctuary. I take my mini disc player (yeah, old school) and just swing while thinking about life. It’s perfect for alone time, except those little kids who look at me like I'm Frankenstein because a big kid is hogging the swing. They get all antsy because I usually stay there for hours. Honestly, little kids are hilarious.\n\nWell, I’ve probably bored you enough for now. Catch you next time!\n\n~Ya di amore~",
    "Welcome to my corner of the world, where sarcasm struggles to convey the true irony of my so-called \"horrible life in bubble town.\" Online, it often gets lost in translation—either making me seem awful or deadly serious. \n\nHowever, today's Monday surprised me in a good way. After a decent night's sleep and actually completing my homework, I endured the bus ride to school. At least I got to sit alone, which is my rare, precious \"alone time.\" Plus, my trumpet demanded extra space.\n\nUpon arrival, I made my usual greetings. Brandon seemed better, though his story involving ceramics was less polite—let’s leave it at that. Carson checked on the new mitten policy that's got her riled up, and we saw a few friends, including cute Jake and some Speech Team members. The missing six-minute bell made me late for Wind Ensemble, but that's just part of the chaos with my trumpet section. We faced a scolding from A when sectionals turned into a free-for-all. I endured playing my dreadful music theory composition, relieved to get it over with. Mrs. Kane’s usual lit analysis paper critique spared us from F’s but not from D's—likely my fate.\n\nGym class brought a highlight with rock climbing, which was thrilling and left me wanting more. The rest of the day was uneventful. With no homework, I'm at a loss for productive activities—go figure. The canceled combo session was a relief given my aversion to soloing, a path we're not even going to explore here.\n\nNow, I'm home, wasting time writing this. More updates might follow if anything notable occurs. Until then, I'm signing off. ~Ya di amore~",
    "Wow, it resembles Alex quite a bit. You know, the one with the nose that seems to cover their entire face! However, the smiley is far more adorable!",
    "Guess who's back? Well, kinda. Just killing time before my lesson. Oh, look! A penny! :) So, how was everyone’s day? Ever wonder who actually responds to their computer? I talk to mine. Then again, I also chat with Genevieve, my locker at school. \n\nYou know what irks me? Besides the word \"irks\"? Parentheses! I use them all the time but never seem to get them right. Grr, pooey. It’s like the Tootsie Roll Pop thing: \"The world may never know,\" or in my case, \"Catie may never know because she's clueless.\"\n\nHold on, someone just called, and I totally forgot what I was writing about. Steve phoned about chemistry stuff. He’s such a cool guy, love him (in a friend kind of way). :) And his hair? The coolest. Chemistry, though? Ugh, I loathe it with a burning passion. Okay, maybe not that intense, but it's definitely annoying.\n\nLast night, we had the evening with humanities. Let's not even go there—it was pretty awful. \n\nWeirdly, no homework today and a free afternoon. No jazz practice this week, which is both awesome and a bummer. I love jazz, but free time is nice too. Has anyone noticed how random all this is? Heh, more fun for spontaneous Catie! RAR!\n\nGuess what? No, really, guess! Okay, fine, I'll tell you. I did high ropes yesterday and crossed the swinging balance beam with Peter. Naturally, Mr. Z found something wrong with it. But we did it! \n\nMaybe I should go warm up for my trumpet lesson. Yes? No? That's fun to say. I'm enjoying this random writing, though. Might drop more updates later. You’re fantastic if you made it this far. Or maybe just clueless about the little X in the corner that could have saved you from this madness. *Ya di amore* :o)",
    "Haven't written in a while due to a busy schedule with Disney and make-up work. Disney was fun, including the bus ride. Being home is nice, though. Learned it's best not to vacation with friends for more than two days as people get edgy. The bus ride was 31 hours. Finally caught up with make-up work. Writing a feature story for journalism on Teenagers VS. Adults, which I'm enjoying. Had a jazz band gig on Wednesday but missed my soli by arriving late. That's about it; off to the mall now. Wish it would snow.",
    "Haha, just finished dinner! Delicious! I'm feeling so happy right now, and I don't even know why, I just am! I'm chatting with my friends while writing this, which is always fun. Plus, I'm doing homework and watching Law & Order at the same time...how talented am I? Anyway, my day was pretty awesome. No band or music theory classes today, which was great. Kristen and I sat and did homework together and talked about Winter. During the next period, I hung out with Chris and Kelly for a bit (and Alex briefly when he was in Gym) before they started working on music. I tend to feel left out when they do that, so I went to a practice room by myself. Unfortunately, I don't have any good stories for the newspaper. It's a shame people didn't read past the second paragraph of my last story before deciding it was terrible. \n\nEPVM was interesting, and I'm getting nervous about my final. My brother, who got perfect ACT and SAT scores, said it was hard...I’m really scared of that test and feel like I'm going to fail. In Gym...oh my gosh...two words: Commando Crawl. Ouch. That was one of the most painful experiences ever. If you ever do that for high ropes, make sure to wear pants. Trust me, it’s so painful if you don’t. I made it through, though, so it's all good, even if it hurt a lot. \n\nMath was boring, as usual. Random thought: Why do I always write these while talking to Alex? Lunch was interesting; I hung out with Kelly, Emily, and then Chris and Alex. It was cool but nothing special. Comparative Religion was boring with project presentations, and chem was boring too, surprise surprise. Then I came home, did some stuff, and that's the end of my day. So, I shall leave now and...well, I’ll just go. You didn't hear anything from me.",
    "I got so many compliments on my hair! It was awesome. I got it cut and layered last night, and I really, really like it! It's shorter but still looks great!\n\nRight now, I'm looking for new furniture for my room. I'm completely redoing it, except for the floor because I like having a wood floor. It's easier to clean if you spill something, which happens a lot with me.\n\nSo anyway, just waiting for dinner to be done. Then, I have to study for my science test. Ugh, science... Oh well, we have a late arrival tomorrow! YES! I was hoping for one, and I was upset because I thought we didn't have it, but then Bryan (with a y) was like, \"yeah, Norkus, you idiot!\" Ouch... Oh well, it's hard to be sad with a late arrival!\n\nExcept finals are next week, and I'm not ready at all. I should probably actually study this time, considering I haven’t studied for finals since high school started. Surprisingly though, I've done well. I don't get it. If I could just learn not to avoid homework, I'd be doing great. For most kids, tests are the problem; for me, it's the homework.\n\nYay! Dinner is ready. I'll write more later!",
    "Avoiding homework yet again is becoming a bad habit. However, I just painted my nails, and typing is actually something I can do without messing them up. I promise I'll get back to homework soon. On a brighter note, today was fantastic! I saw *HIM* four times, and it was amazing. He even noticed and spoke to me twice out of the three times I approached him. It's exciting!\n\nSchool wasn't bad either. This morning, I chose to sit with my best friends instead of waiting outside the band room. I hadn't realized how much I missed spending time with them. Kathryn is doing well, busy working on her paper, and of course, Joanne and John were flirting. They make such a wonderful couple, and I do feel a bit envious at times. It would be nice to have someone like that in my life. I'm still deciding if I want to ask someone to the Winter dance. I would love to go, but I'm unsure who to ask. Definitely not *HIM*. Perhaps I'll just go with a friend, and everything will be fine.\n\nKelly S. was her usual cool self, even though she was complaining about stuff. I love her to death regardless. Band class was different today since Peter was absent, which meant less teasing. Surprisingly, it felt a bit unsettling; I guess I've grown accustomed to the daily banter. Music theory was alright, but I'm seriously considering dropping the class. I don't feel like I'm learning much or enjoying it, and my time could be better spent elsewhere. Kelly Coyle wasn't too happy about it, but I have to do what's best for me.\n\nEPVM was as boring as usual, especially with a substitute teacher. Gym, however, was thrilling! I went on the high ropes course and was terrified yet exhilarated. Mehgan and I did great, completing three courses today despite Allen's antics wasting some time. My watch falling off was a scare, but everything turned out fine. There was some tension with Kelly and Erica, but I hope no one's upset with me. I really dislike having people mad at me.\n\nMath was challenging, but I've finally figured out the key to understanding the teacher's methods. He's actually a good teacher if you can stay awake in his class. Anyway, I have to go now—time for a haircut! I'll write more later.",
    "Welp... haha, what a funny word, perhaps because it isn’t a real word! Anyway, I just finished my paper a bit ago, and now my mom is correcting it. Gulp! I feel like I’ve forgotten how to write normally thanks to Mrs. Kane's emphasis on journalistic style. It’s difficult for me to stop thinking, \"Is that objective?\" Argh, so annoying!\n\nI just vented to Bryan about jazz. I'm really trying to forgive Alstadt, but it still bothers me a lot that he never asked, consulted, or even told me! Still, forgiveness is the right thing to do, so that’s what I will strive for. \n\nThis weekend has actually been pretty cool. I'm feeling a lot better. I spent the whole weekend reading—three really good books. I also watched Pretty Woman last night. It was so cute that it almost makes me want to become a prostitute in search of love... but not really. \n\n“Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking. It is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil, but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails.” - 1 Corinthians 13:4-8. \n\nI love that passage; it’s so great and true. I also came across another fantastic quote today, though it’s not from the Bible. Dr. Seuss said, “Be who you are and say what you feel, for those who mind don't matter and those who matter don't mind.” Again, so great and so true.\n\nAnyway, I must go finish my conversation with Bryan and then off to bed. Ahh, sleep, I love you! :)",
    "I'm currently avoiding homework and chatting with Brandon. I'm really nervous about the upcoming jazz competition. Although I don't have any solo parts in the songs we're playing, \"Jumpin' at the Westside\" is still making me anxious. I just know I'm going to freak out. Anyway, I've been really unwell for the past week. First, it was a cold, then an ear infection—just one illness after another. I'm so tired of being sick. I'll come back and write more after I finish my paper. I'm determined to get it done. Talk to you later.",
    "RAR! (Sorry, just love typing that!) I'm currently working on my music theory final—last minute, of course. Rock on! Had jazz today and I’m doing better. When called upon, I didn’t panic or refuse to participate. No real finals today, just a tough band final and a Comparative Religion class without a final—yay! The rest of the day has been uneventful. I'll write more if anything interesting happens, but I doubt it!",
    "I decided not to go. I talked to Chris about what was bothering me, and it really helped. I love that kid; he's great to talk to when you're upset. I didn't want to tell him at first, but he made me, and I'm glad he did. It felt good to get it out. I cried for the first time in a long time, maybe since my Grandma's funeral. I miss her a lot. I think I need to cry or get upset more often because holding it in hurts more when it all comes out at once. I really want someone to like me for who I am. I don't understand why no one does. I'm not the best looking, but I'm not the worst, and I try to be a good person. It feels like no one appreciates my efforts. I'll be fine tomorrow. Writing and talking to people I trust helps, even if no one reads this. Anyway, off to bed. Goodnight.",
    "Once more, I'm feeling down about winter. Honestly, I need to remind myself to chill out because it's pretty selfish. When I think about it, I'm in a much better position than about 99% of the global population. I'm here whining about a dance, which is really on me. I should've just asked someone to go with me. This situation is such a letdown. It seems like literally everyone else has a date for this event. Gotta run...bye.",
    "Tonight's entry will be short since I'm really tired and need sleep. Today was pretty ordinary, though we had a fun late arrival. Mr. Alstadt won’t be here for the next two days, so no music theory. \n\nThe only notable event was being called to Mrs. Plumbers—but it was just a mix-up, so no worries. Jazz practice was frustrating with Nathan not acting like a section leader, and Tom being disruptive. Steve should be the section leader because he cares about our sound. \n\nAfter jazz, I had my lesson and that was it. I know this isn’t exciting, but people expect me to write daily. \n\nOn a sad note, my great uncle Al passed away recently. Please pray for his wife and close family. Thanks, everyone. Goodnight. XOXO",
    "I miss Heather. She was the one person I could confide in. I really feel her absence. :(",
    "Wow, what a difference a day makes! Today was way better than yesterday, and it started off on a high note. I can usually sense how my day will go just from the morning vibes. Big news: I got my schedule sorted out, and I finally cleared things up with Kathryn. She totally understands now, which is such a relief because I was so worried she’d be upset with me.\n\nEver felt like the whole world is ganging up on you? Trust me, it’s a pretty lousy feeling. Right now, I feel kind of alone without any close friends to lean on when things get tough or when I'm feeling down. I really miss Amanda, Hillary, and Kelly. Lately, I've just been feeling so down and I can't even pinpoint exactly why. Maybe it's the emptiness of not having a best friend or the longing for a boyfriend. As much as it seems pathetic, I do want someone who listens to me and cares. But finding that special someone feels like a distant dream right now.\n\nYeah, I’m heading to Winter, but I realize it’s not the season I wanted—it’s the person I wanted to share it with. I envisioned going with someone special, not just a friend, and that realization just sucks. It’s one of those times where I feel like crying, which is so unlike me.\n\nAnyway, today’s a bit better. Sorry for the rant, just had an EXB moment. Not great! But I’m trying to lift my spirits with some Dave Matthews. Love his music! So, yeah, I’ve got to sign off now because people are actually IM’ing me. Maybe I’ll jot down some more thoughts later. Catch you later!",
    "The Bucs won, yay! I'm not typically a big football fan, which is odd since my whole family loves it and I'm in the marching band. Anyway, we have a small problem: I'm finally going to Winter, but Kelly's left out. We're thinking she could go with Neil since we all know him. I wish I could invite Kristen, Alex, Taylor, and her boyfriend, but I'm not sure if Kathryn and Joanne would be okay with that. I'm confused right now. School starts tomorrow, and it doesn't feel like it, maybe because of the Superbowl. I still can't believe we placed yesterday, though I wonder how many bands there were. Last year we got 5th out of 5, but this year we did great. I should sleep now. Good night, everyone!",
    "Everyone else is watching the Super Bowl, so there's not much else to do. I've been thinking a lot. I said I wanted to go to Winter and all, but now that I am, I'm not sure if I really want to. I mean, I asked him, but we're just going as friends. I want to go with someone I truly like, more than just a friend. I love him as a friend and we've known each other for so long, but I wish I were going with someone I have deeper feelings for. Oh well, it's still nice to be going. I wish it weren't so cold out; I need to go for a walk, or maybe a bike ride, just to think. I really do love people, but I need my alone time. It was like poor Emily on the Disney trip—I just need to be alone sometimes!\n\nActually, I'm starting to get excited about Winter. I've been talking to Joanne and Kristen, and they’re excited for me too, which makes me feel the same way. I think it'll be fun, especially with a group of people I enjoy spending time with! Anyway, more later. I'm actually having conversations with people who aren't watching the Super Bowl! Yay!",
    "Wow, I can't believe it. I almost wish I could have seen more class AA bands. JSO didn't win any awards, which completely shocked me because they are awesome. As Alex said, \"There must have been some seriously Godly bands if they beat JSO!\" \n\nBut oh well, considering JSO isn't my band, let's talk about Jazz Band. We placed 3rd, probably out of three bands, but still. It was nice to place, especially since JSO didn't, even though they're amazing and we, well, aren't. My soli went okay—not too bad. I still need to play louder, and I didn't mess up any notes, just the timing a bit at measure 110. Overall, it was actually pretty good, I thought.\n\nAnyway, I'm not quite sure what's going on with Andy and Diane, but it seems like Diane is happy, and if she's happy, then I'm happy too. That's all I wanted to write for now. Haha, \"write for right\" amuses me. \n\nOkay, I must go do something fun since there's no homework! YES! I'll write more later, maybe. :)",

    "I had trouble sleeping because I'm extremely upset over what's happening. Zach is supposedly in surgery, and Richa has internal bleeding. It's devastating. There was also another accident in which a student died. I just want everyone to be safe, and I wish I had someone to talk to right now, but nobody is available online. I'm at a loss between crying and keeping it together. I mean, I have cried, but sometimes I wish I didn't care so much about people I barely know. It wouldn't hurt as much if only close friends affected me this deeply. It's so unfair because they're both such intelligent and kind individuals. Why them? I feel like expressing my care to important people in my life, but it's difficult for me to show my emotions. This whole situation makes me incredibly sad. I even wish I could go back to elementary or junior high days when everything seemed safer, and no one got seriously hurt or died. I also feel like I should do something to help, even though there's really nothing I can do. Praying doesn't seem enough; I feel the need to take some physical action. Maybe I just need to clear my head. I had planned to write about my day, but it seems trivial now. I just hope everything turns out okay for them.",
    "Why is it that bad things happen to good people? I desperately wish the mantra, \"Good things happen to good people,\" was always true. Unfortunately, reality often defies this hopeful notion. Tonight, two truly amazing individuals were involved in a car accident. Though they're in stable condition, it's heartbreaking. They are wonderful, principled people, and this shouldn't have happened to them. I'm fervently hoping for their swift recovery, and they are constantly in my prayers.\n\nRicha and Zach are invaluable to our school and have the potential to make significant contributions to the world beyond high school. I find myself grappling with the harsh truth: bad things do happen to exceptionally good people. This harsh reality urges me to reflect on my own blessings—my wonderful family, financial stability, shelter, food, friends, and life itself. It's a stark reminder of how precious life is, often brought to light by tragedies like Kari's death or Richa and Zach's accident.\n\nI have a tendency to judge others when I perceive them as selfish, yet I realize I might be guilty of the same. In moments of crisis, a friend reminded me, \"It's times like these you have to have faith.\" And that I do. I pray every night, but sometimes it feels more like a routine than a heartfelt appeal. Tonight, my prayers hold profound meaning as I think deeply of Richa and Zach, hoping others will also join me in praying for their recovery.",

    "Well, things are going well! I made it to 5th chair, ahead of Dan. I walked into band with Dan, and Peter teasingly said, \"She beat you!\" The expression on Dan's face was priceless—the funniest thing ever. It felt so good to make it, and I am really happy about it, though I have been in a bit of a funk. I miss my old, wild self and want to stop mimicking others. I was talking to someone about this recently, and he confessed to doing the same thing—adopting pieces of other people's personalities. It's silly. I need to rediscover my own personality—be fun, be me, not shy, and more trustworthy, though that will take time. Maybe I am being myself, but I can't be sure. I'm so incredibly confused right now. I don't even feel invested in the \"A\" audition anymore, which feels pathetic given the time I spent worrying about it. I feel disconnected from everything at the moment, which I absolutely hate. I should be happy; nothing is wrong, and there's really nothing to complain about. I just feel sad. Life goes on, though. Maybe I'm just having a bad day—probably because it's cold again. Anyway, I'm heading off to shop with my mom at Oakbrook — not even excited about that, which is terrible. Oh well, I'll probably write more later. Today feels like a writing day... XOXO",
    "Well, I still don’t feel bad about what I said. Jim brought it up and thought I was referring to Dave K. today. I was like, no way! Haha. I actually thought Dave K. was upset with me today. It was strange... Anyway, school was fine. I haven't officially found out yet, but Mr. A. said everything’s okay and not to worry, so I won’t. Jazz class was decent today; I was playing, and not too quietly either! :) So, there’s really not much to say about my day because it was pretty uneventful. I don’t feel like typing now or later, for that matter. You know who it is, and if you don’t, you’re just not cool... XOXO",

The suspense is killing me! Just had to vent my frustration to someone. Catch you later – fingers crossed for tomorrow! 😫",
    "Amazing, just amazing! Haha, I felt an overwhelming need to say that! Anyway, today has been better, thinking about the audition and all. I haven't dwelled on it as much, but yeah... dun dun dun. The results are coming out tomorrow, but in the afternoon! Grrrrr, that's so annoying. I just want to know, whether it's good or bad. Oh well, it's frustrating, but not really that bad. I enjoy being myself :)",

I'm reading this book called \"Tangerine.\" I've already read it a couple of times, but for some reason, I really enjoy it. I'm not quite sure why.\n\nAnyway, there's not much else to say.

It’s almost unsettling how tidy everything is now. \n\nI love inventing words; it's so entertaining. Fortunately, I didn’t have a gig this weekend, according to Brandon. Hopefully, he’s right! I was supposed to hang out with Kathryn today, but instead, I went to lunch with Joanne and Diane. Kathryn seemed okay on the phone, but I think she’s a bit upset about it. We’ll make plans for next weekend though. \n\nBy the way, coffee smells amazing, even though I don’t actually like drinking it. Matthew and I were chatting about coffee earlier. Am I rambling?

If it doesn't pan out, it's not my fault since I knew nothing about it.\n\nToday, I had lunch with Diane and Joanne, which was really enjoyable. However, I felt a bit guilty because Diane and I were talking about marching band stuff that Joanne doesn't know about, making her feel left out. This happens often when I'm with band folks, and I don't mean to exclude others. Despite that, it was fun reminiscing about freshman year, though I also enjoy sophomore year. Anyway, I need to go.

I anticipate that I will miss him greatly, as he has been a significant support to me and someone I can confide in, which has been quite surprising. While having the bathroom to myself will be a small consolation, it is not sufficient; I would much prefer to have my brother here. Over the past few months, we have grown much closer.\n\nTurning to less melancholic matters, today overall was rather somber. However, it was not entirely negative, just the experience of delivering my speech. The speech did not go well, and I have decided against practicing for speeches in the future, as it seemed to disturb my performance. Additionally, bringing my entire outline with me was a mistake. Nonetheless, I would rather not dwell on this topic any further, as it is quite painful to revisit.\n\nOn a lighter note, I wore a skirt today.

Kelly drove, and we made a pit stop at McDonald's on the way back. It was awesome! We grabbed some food and cruised home, jamming out to the Now and Then soundtrack. We belted out the lyrics and I even busted some moves. Total blast!! Kelly S. is amazing, and I adore Kelly C. too! Seriously, Kellys just make my life better!

    "Today was just another ordinary day, and honestly, I can barely remember half of what happened. I was so out of it. Haha, I wore my black hoodie with the hood up, and no one could recognize me at first since they usually identify me by my hair. I must have looked pretty out of it because like five people told me I looked stoned this morning. It was quite funny.\n\nThere's talk that the juniors might have to retake the ACT, which would be such a drag. Apparently, four answer booklets were stolen, so they held an assembly about it. The whole situation is pretty messed up.\n\nI really hate group work in math; it's the worst. Seriously, it's so frustrating. GRRRR! On the upside, I totally lucked out with my government packet today. I don't want to go into details, but I managed to score 33/35 even though I did the packet after the test, right before it was graded. It was a bit of a miracle, really.\n\nAnyway, I'm getting tired of typing in public spaces, so I think I'll switch back to my private diary. I still write in there, but occasionally I type here too. From now on, I might just stick to the diary because managing two entries is too much work for someone as lazy as me.",

I think Dave might have read an earlier entry in here, because he's been a lot nicer to me the past couple of days, at least since Jazz Cafe. Maybe he's just gone back to his old self, which I really hope is the case. I missed the old Dave; he was different from most guys. \n\nAnyway, I didn't do much this past weekend. The only notable thing was hanging out with Chris, Jim, and Alex, which was a lot of fun. Alex's mom made us dinner, and it was delicious. Then we went to Chris's place to watch \"Swimfan\" and \"The Matrix,\" which I hadn't seen before. \"The Matrix\" was awesome! I don't usually like those kinds of movies, but this one was really cool.\n\nI have to go soon because we've got a gig at Ellsworth Elementary. It should be fun, and I wonder if we'll get to see the kids play. That would be so cool and do wonders for my self-esteem.\n\nBefore I go, I heard a really mean saying the other day that I thought was funny at first, but then I felt terrible for laughing. Someone said, \"I'm outta here like the fat kid in dodgeball.\" It's terrible, isn't it?

    "After discussing my feelings with a particular individual, I find myself considerably less angry. I am very grateful for this conversation; you know who you are. It appears that speaking with someone who understands my situation was precisely what I required this evening. I am relieved that my anger has subsided, although I do not fully comprehend the reasons behind my earlier frustration. I was extremely upset, disappointed with the world, and quite annoyed. However, I am optimistic that things will improve by tomorrow. Goodnight.",
    "??????? - (1:31:56 AM): Hey, you’re absolutely amazing! You’re one of those incredible people who always knows how to lift my spirits. Thank you so much!",
    "I only want to talk to my mom, Ryan, and Alex right now.",
    "I don't understand why some people make me angry while others don't.",
    "Darn it. I am extremely angry, disappointed, and sad right now. It's quite disheartening.",
    "You know who's the absolute coolest person ever? Someone so amazing they deserve an award? Ryan. Ryan Dewitt. Thanks, Ryan! You're the best! Love ya!",
    "Guess what? I just discovered that Peter doesn't hate me after all! What a relief. It's such a weight off my shoulders because the thought of someone despising me is just the worst feeling ever.",
    "The past few days have been alright, just kind of relaxing. I've been sick all week, feeling terrible, so I finally decided to stay home since I didn't have any major commitments. Thank goodness for that. Getting some real sleep has helped me start to feel better. I had marching tryouts on Wednesday and Thursday, and yesterday we did the basics. It wasn't nearly as tough as I expected, thankfully. I'm actually glad I stuck with marching and promised my mom I would continue with it. We watched our senior movie that features the song \"We Go On,\" which brings back memories from my freshman year show and always makes me feel sad.\n\nLast night, I had a scary conversation with Chris. He asked me, \"What if I just told you how I really felt about you?\" I started panicking because I couldn't tell if he was serious, and I didn't know how to respond nicely since he'd already had a rough week. Later, someone asked me why I don't just go out with Chris. I don't think people understand that we're just good friends and nothing more. I could never date Chris; it would be too weird. No offense to him, but we both feel the same way.\n\nI'm tired of people assuming I want to date my guy friends. I discussed this with Bryan, and he's so easy to talk to. I'm grateful for his friendship, and no, I don't like him as more than a friend either. Enough said. You get my point. Goodbye.",
    "I stumbled upon an old journal entry today, reflecting on how I could never forgive him for what he did to her. But honestly, it's not my place to forgive—it's hers. I despise his actions and would definitely kick his scrawny butt if he ever hurt her again, but forgiveness isn't mine to give. This entry might be confusing to anyone else, but I needed to get it out for my own peace of mind.",
    "I included that conversation with Katharine here because it lifts my spirits. It made me feel very special, and it will be comforting to revisit when I'm feeling down. I'm not sure if she truly meant what she said or if she says that to everyone, but it made me happy regardless. Unfortunately, I have a cold, courtesy of my mom from last weekend, and now my head, nose, and eyes are all in pain. The timing couldn't be worse, since I have an eye doctor appointment tomorrow and my eyes are constantly watering. Today wasn't very eventful and was quite boring overall. I'm involved in marching band, and there's some confusion about leadership roles. Brandon became the section leader for marching, while Peter got the role for music. Despite the confusion, it's good that Brandon has a higher position because Peter really doesn't like me. There's so much going on at once, but nothing particularly interesting to share. Goodbye for now! :) Overall mood for the day: Happy.",

    "Wow! \"Bruce Almighty\" was quite the riot, and catching it with Kathryn made it even better. Our post-movie hangout at Overweis was great for chatting, though the conversation took a tough turn. It stings when you feel like nobody really gets or cares about you. Everyone teases me, and while sometimes it's harmless fun, other times it really cuts deep. Particularly, I despise the jabs about my vision; it's not like I chose this, right? If people think it's so amusing, they should try fixing it themselves! \n\nDespite my pleas, they might stop for a moment but always revert. Why am I such an easy target? Sure, I'm not Miss America, but I consider myself a pretty decent person — kind, honest, and with good morals. But instead of appreciation, I'm constantly torn down. Why strive to be good when all you get is grief? Honestly, there’s no point.\n\nI like who I am, but it’s exhausting to stay on the right path when the world insists on knocking you down. It seems like bad behavior is celebrated — getting drunk, promiscuity, and cruelty are in vogue. Well, if that’s the definition of cool, count me out. \n\nMy school environment is disheartening, and I find respect hard to come by. I'm eagerly awaiting summer for a break from it all, only to face the same cycle again next year. The endless parade of disappointment in people and their choices is draining. \n\nI crave an escape to Michigan, somewhere far from the negativity here. Even if I eventually see flaws in new faces, it will at least be a fresh start. It's baffling to see peers chase popularity for what? Four years of misery? Four years of self-loathing masked by forced attention? And for what—people you might never see again? What a waste.\n\nHere’s to hoping for something better.",
    "Today has been somewhat disappointing. I'm in a downcast mood, and I really want to see him. I know I shouldn't have feelings for him, and maybe I don't truly, but it feels like I do. I'd like to spend time with him outside of school. I imagine he'd be enjoyable to hang out with. Oh well. Tonight, I'm hopefully going to watch Bruce Almighty with Kathryn, which should be a fun time. Yay! Everyone seems so occupied, and my weekend feels incredibly dull. I'm not sure why, but... 'eh. I want to see someone I can't, and that doesn't help matters.\n\nYesterday was a good day. School was quite boring as usual, but last night I attended One Acts with Kelly, Kathryn, and Joanne. It was really funny, and Mary Clare tugged her ear five times to greet us from the stage. :) It was neat. During intermission, we joined a group of band people, and there must have been something in the air because we were all acting crazy! Wooo! Anyway, it was fun and... yeah, now I'm off to the movies with Kathryn! Woo hoo. Bye-bye.",
    "Absolutely! Here's a more enthusiastic version:\n\nShe said it was no big deal, but... I still think she's mad at me! She told me not to worry about her, so... I guess I'll try my best! I care about her so much and never, ever want to say anything that would make her upset. :) I need to put some thought into this!",
    "Yesterday was quite eventful. I managed to go the entire school day without speaking, as part of a bet, and ended up winning $20. It was challenging but interesting, especially since I couldn't write down why I was silent. Fortunately, one person guessed correctly, and after that, it became easier as he helped spread the word to others. \n\nAfter school, I had a bit of a panic when I couldn't find my dress for the concert, but eventually, I found it and attended the concert. Surprisingly, we performed quite well. During the concert band segment, Kristen and I noted six positive aspects: the red bow ties, recognizable melodies, a good beat, and their arrangement on stage where the tallest members stood in the center and shortest on the ends. We also appreciated Mr. S and another point which I can't recall now.\n\nOverall, it was a fun event, and I was happy to get home and rest. I slept soundly through the night, which was refreshing. Today was relatively normal, including the usual marching band practice where we performed \"Washington Post\" as we do for every parade, followed by some outdoor marching. Brandon drove me home afterward.\n\nHowever, I feel terrible about an incident with a joke. My friend, who is very thin, and I have this ongoing joke about her pretending to complain about being fat. I absentmindedly put up an away message saying I dislike it when skinny people think they're fat. Unfortunately, someone I didn't intend to hurt saw the message and seemed upset. I discovered this through her away message and diary entry.\n\nI tried to call her, but she was eating dinner. I really need to clarify that the message wasn't about her. This situation has taught me a valuable lesson about being careful with my words, which could serve as a good example for my upcoming speech on thinking before speaking. Thankfully, she came online later, and I had the chance to straighten things out.",
    "I had a really busy day with plenty to share, but I'm too worn out to write about it now. I'll put it all down tomorrow. It's funny how many times I used the words \"write\" and \"right.\" Anyway, I'm too tired, so goodbye for now.",
    "It's amusing to think about, but he's never had the right to do that. He's never earned it, even with all the time he's had. It would likely take him twice as long as he's known me to earn that right. I realize no one understands what I'm talking about, but that's probably for the best.",
    "Get away from me, you jerk! I don't like you and don't want to speak to you for a long time. For now, stay away from me. I'm very upset and angry. Who are you to tell me anything when you can't control your own life? You're a huge jerk. Back off!",
    "Today was an average day. Band practice went as usual, though it was held in the auditorium, which is unpleasantly warm due to the lights. Thankfully, our Music Theory instructor remained silent; I wasn't up for a lecture. In Chemistry, we conducted a lab, but nothing noteworthy happened. In Health class, we reviewed the female reproductive system. A classmate named Kat isn't afraid to ask bold questions that most wouldn't dare to voice. She also shared some personal information that I could have done without, leaving us with an awkward comment about her menstrual cycle before departing. Speech class was dull; we had a quiz and some activities. I need to choose a new topic for my persuasive speech due to a lack of sources, and my speech is on Friday. Lunch was unremarkable. We had a difficult quiz in Math, and Government class was its usual fun. Just before Government, I entered one of my quiet moods while walking through the hall. I'm not upset or angry, I just sometimes prefer silence, although it worries others and they repeatedly ask if I'm okay. Anyway, I'm off to make dinner now. Goodbye.",
    "Someone bet that I couldn’t stay silent for an entire school day. I’m absolutely going to take on this challenge. It’s going to be great. The only problem will be explaining this to everyone.",
    "I enjoy being quiet, but people always ask, \"What's wrong? Are you okay, Catie?\" I'm perfectly fine and happy, just quiet. Is that a problem? Sometimes it feels like it. Anyway, I'm off to have dinner or do something constructive.",

    "Chatting with Christy at the moment—it's truly amazing. I really miss her. My trust in her is incredible; she's probably the most trustworthy person in my life, aside from my mom.",
    "I didn't end up doing anything, but I guess that happens sometimes. I just didn't want to spend my Saturday night alone. I really wish I could drive; it would be such an escape for me. Being able to drive would mean I could go places by myself without needing anyone else's help. It would be incredibly liberating.\n\nI'm longing for summer to arrive. I want to go to Michigan, feel the sand beneath my feet, and let the cool waves splash against my legs. I dream of walking alone along the beach at sunset, just being by myself in a beautiful place.\n\nI think I'll go read now. Bye.",

    "I headed to Michaels to snag a shirt for our Chemistry tie-dye project. I was hoping for a long-sleeved one, but no luck! Guess it wasn't meant to be. Oh well, that's how it goes sometimes! Now, what fun adventure should I dive into tonight?",
    "This is a list of the colors people have mentioned so far:\n- Diane: Orange\n- Derek: Red\n- Kelly: Red\n- Matthew: Orange\n- Kristen: Orange\n- Joanne: Yellow\n- Mary Clare: Sky blue\n- Brett: Blue\n- Emily: Yellow\n- Dave: Sepia\n- Bryan: Bright yellow\n- Chris: Orange\n- Brandon: Green\n- Me: Brown\n\nI wanted to keep track of everyone's chosen colors, so I'm noting them here.",
    "Haha. It’s astonishing to think about just how much of a loser I was during my childhood. The memory really amazes me. While I still consider myself somewhat of a loser today, reminiscing about the days when I would alphabetize my crayons really takes the cake. Wow, just wow.",
    "I'm glad I can stay home on a Friday night without feeling bad.",
    "Alright, here’s my take on injecting some dynamism into your text:\n\nAlright, I've come to realize that if I were a crayon, I'd be brown. Let's talk about the brown crayon for a moment. It doesn't get the love it deserves. Hardly anyone appreciates it, except for a select few. Despite the lack of respect, everyone needs the brown crayon now and then—for drawing trees, brown hair, you name it. Yet, how often do we stop to consider how indispensable the brown crayon truly is?\n\nThink about it: we constantly overlook the brown crayon, but it’s crucial for so many creations. One day, all this neglect might just cause the brown crayon to explode from sheer rejection, and that would be a disaster. Kids are always drawn to the bright and flashy colors—blue, purple, pink. But it’s not about appearances. It’s about usefulness and what the crayon can do.\n\nThe brown crayon is a silent helper, always ready to step in, even though it gets pushed aside. Reflecting on this, I get a bit philosophical when I'm tired… or maybe just a little weird. :)",
    "This week has been going well and is passing quickly, unlike the slow pace I expect next week. I don't feel like typing now, so maybe I'll write more later. I need to make dinner anyway.",
    "I find myself longing for Victoria's presence. The way she would always come to me when I called, the manner in which she was willing to do anything for me, is something I deeply miss. Her nightly companionship, as she slept beside me, was a source of great comfort. I fondly remember how she would respond exclusively to me, how she had a special bond with me alone. Others would often say, \"Catie, go get Victoria, you're the only one who can,\" and it made me feel unique. Her innate ability to sense my sadness from anywhere in the house and her determination to find and console me were irreplaceable.\n\nI miss my cat. MY cat. She was wholly mine, and her affection for me was genuine and unconditional. She accepted me entirely, without any desire to change who I was. Her love was pure and unwavering.\n\nThe memory of discovering her lifeless on the floor is something that haunts me—I lost her in such a tragic manner. Her absence leaves a void that feels almost unbearable. If she were here now, she would listen to me, cry with me, and cuddle up to me, providing the comfort I desperately need.\n\nIt's hard to reconcile with the pain of thinking about that moment again, the moment I found her lying motionless. I've tried to avoid dwelling on it because the thought is too much to bear. Crying won't bring her back, though. The loss of something that loved me so completely feels as though a shard of glass has pierced my heart.",
    "I would genuinely appreciate it if people could answer this question honestly: What is wrong with me? Why does it seem like no one, except Matt, likes me? I truly don’t understand. I think I’m a decent person, but maybe I'm just fooling myself. Maybe I've been deluding myself all this time. It feels like I'm never going to find someone. No one seems even remotely interested in me. Everyone else finds someone and shares their happiness, but I get left out. I love that people trust me and confide in me, but it hurts when I realize that nobody talks about me to others. It feels like no one likes me, has ever liked me, or will ever like me. Right now, not only is the glass half empty; it feels completely empty and shattered.",
    "Hmm, what should I do? I'm so unsure and my thoughts are all over the place. Life feels so bewildering at the moment. Michigan. Michigan. Michigan. If I just keep focusing on that, I think I'll find some joy. :)",
    "Haha, so Angie and I came up with a fantastic analogy. Imagine abstinence is like Thanksgiving dinner. You skip all the snacks and meals throughout the day because you know the feast at the end is going to be absolutely amazing. Woohoo for abstinence!",

    "I still can't begin to comprehend what he did to his first girlfriend.",
    "I'm genuinely shocked at how furious I am. I mean, I'm extremely angry—beyond what words can describe. Wasn't it bad enough to hurt one person? Now you're trying to ruin someone else's life too? Another issue is that I can't be around her if she's with him. It would drive me insane. I'd feel an overwhelming urge to lash out.",
    "AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!! Darn it, thanks for ruining everything, you jerk. Thanks a lot.",
    "Nothing makes my blood boil more than this! It's absolutely infuriating. And she's getting dragged into this mess despite my efforts. I can see her crumbling, and there isn't a darn thing I can do about it! Even if I expose him for the slimeball he is, recount his despicable actions towards his ex-girlfriend, she won't budge. She thrives on defying advice, and knowing her, she'd probably run to him even faster just to prove a point. UGH! It's nauseating. Seriously, it's gut-wrenching.\n\nHe's going to break her heart just like he did with his last girlfriend. Mark my words, he's got the makings of an abusive partner. The scary part is, he can seem so normal, but he's impulsive and dangerous. An abusive relationship is on the horizon, I can just see it. But she craves companionship so much that she's willing to overlook all the red flags.\n\nAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!! This is an absolute disaster, and it's truly eating away at me. On a brighter note, I had a wonderful long chat with Joanne tonight. It was pure bliss. God, I love her! But it's hard to shake off this worry. He’s going to hurt her, and not just emotionally; he might even hurt her physically. He's going to destroy her, strip away her dignity, and I know I'll be right. But trust me, saying \"I told you so\" will bring no satisfaction. It never does, especially when the stakes are this high. Everyone deserves a second chance, but he's blown so many with her. SO MANY. It's just maddening.\n\nI really need to get some sleep...",
    "Haha, I just noticed I wrote \"my kelly's\" as if I own them! Haha! They're all mine!",
    "Alright, I've made up my mind. There's no way I'm going to lose connection with my close friends like Kelly, Joanne, Kathryn, and Emily. I refuse to let that happen. I'm committed to this! HMPH!",
    "I've had a vision! When Kelly becomes rich and famous, I'll attend one of her concerts and try to get backstage. The guards will yell, \"GET AWAY, YOU WHITE-HAIRED NUTCASE!\" I'll protest, \"But I know her!\" They'll laugh, but then Kelly will appear and say, \"Catie, my love.\" I'll laugh right in the guards' faces. It will be glorious!",
    "Despite the song's musical shortcomings, I still love it. We talked all night about our futures and where we'd be by 25, thinking things would never change. As we leave this year behind, we won't return. Hanging out is over since we're on different paths. If you have something to say, say it now because time is running out. We're moving on swiftly, with memories replaying like a silent film. I recall a night in June when love was new and overwhelming. \n\nWe spent hours talking on the phone, feeling both excited and scared, finding humor in life's unfairness. This is how it feels:\n\nAs we move on, we'll remember all our times together. Though our lives change, our friendship will endure. Whether we achieve big jobs and wealth, we'll reflect on our shared jokes, lessons from school, and rule-breaking. Will brainy Bobby become a stockbroker? Can Anna find a job that suits her? \n\nIt's not goodbye, but a new beginning. We wonder if we'll view tomorrow as we do today and if we'll succeed. We thought youth would last forever, but now we face adulthood. The past might linger, but we'll keep those memories. \n\nAs we go on, we'll remember all the times we had together. No matter what comes, we'll always be friends.",
    "I feel sad today because it was the seniors' last day. Although I don't know many seniors, their departure makes me realize how close I am to becoming a senior myself, which means leaving and not seeing my friends anymore. Next year, I will lose my best friend, Chris, and other close friends. I'm worried about Chris because I can talk to him easily and feel comfortable around him. I'm scared that after he goes to college, we might lose touch.\n\nHaving a specific best friend feels tough because they eventually leave or we grow apart. This has happened before with Christy and Amanda, although I know Kelly will always be my friend. We've known each other for so long, and I'm confident we'll stay in contact throughout our lives.\n\nI hardly talk to Christy anymore, and I only talk to Amanda because our moms are best friends. I still care about them, but we don't communicate much. As for other close friends, Kelly C. and I may grow apart as our lives take different directions, even though I'll support her career. I don't know what will happen with Kathryn; I think we'll try to stay in touch but eventually talk less. If Emily moves to Europe, staying in contact will be difficult. Joanne is already going to England, and our contact might also fade.\n\nI need to stop thinking about this because it’s making me sad. I've had a blessed life, but change is hard for me to accept. This realization has truly bummed me out. Things feel so sad right now.",
    "What concerns me the most is that I wouldn't be surprised if that happened. I find it amusing to speak when no one around me understands my meaning.",
    "I miss my cat. But nope, not right now. I can't think about her now or I'll just start crying. I've shoved those feelings way back in my mind, and that's where they're going to stay.",

It's as if something is missing, like there's something obvious that I'm failing to grasp. I'm just, I don't know...",
    "Time isn't really time at all. You can't leave without leaving a piece of your youth behind, and our lives are always changing — we'll never be the same. The more you change, the less you feel. But believe in me, believe that life can change and that you're not stuck. We're different tonight, and tonight is so bright.\n\nSometimes you might not be sure, but deep down you know you could be right if you just look inside yourself. The memories of your hometown never fade, and that's where you were born. Believe in me and in the urgency of now. Even if it feels like there's no more \"tonight,\" tonight is still so bright.\n\nWe'll cast away insincerity tonight, make things right, and truly feel everything. We'll find a way to embrace the night, savoring those indescribable moments. The impossible can become possible tonight. Just believe in me as I believe in you, tonight.",
    "I was just revisiting some of my very first blog entries, and wow, the transformation is incredible! It's truly amazing to see how much I've grown. Anyway, I stumbled upon this beautiful passage that I want to share again, just to keep it fresh in my heart:\n\n\"Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking. It is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil, but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails.\" - 1 Corinthians 13:4-8 😍\n\nI absolutely adore this! I love the Bible! I love God!!! Sometimes, people might think I'm not a believer, but it's the total opposite. I just prefer to worship in my own quiet, personal way. I don't like imposing my beliefs on others. It really bothers me when people try to force their views on someone else. My love and devotion to God are unwavering, and that's all that matters to me. Honestly, if others don't share the same belief, that's okay, because nothing I say will change their minds.\n\nIt baffles me why so many wars are fought over religion. Don't you see that this is exactly what God doesn't want? Killing in His name is so contradictory, and it frustrates me so much. Can't we just let everyone believe in what they want to believe? Why must there be conflict?\n\nPhew, sorry for the vent! Just had to get that out. 🙏🌟",
    "Absolutely! Here’s a more enthusiastic version:\n\nWow, you won't believe what Katharine just told me! She shared this *incredible* song that she and Diane are absolutely obsessed with. And guess what? I *love* it too!

    "AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!! I am exceedingly stressed at the moment, to the point of feeling overwhelmed. I find myself growing increasingly intolerant of him. It seems as though he goes out of his way to provoke me intentionally, as if he wakes up every morning with the intention of finding ways to infuriate me.\n\nI recently went online and concluded that engaging in a conversation with anyone right now would be futile. It’s imprudent to even consider such an attempt because I am likely to say something I do not mean. I am experiencing a profound sense of distress and loneliness. Despite having wonderful friends, I cannot escape this feeling of solitude. I acknowledge that feeling lonely is a normal part of the human experience. Paradoxically, though I feel lonely, I also desire solitude at this moment. I am not inclined to interact with many people at school tomorrow; I would prefer to be left alone, without being subjected to conversation, nagging, teasing, or any other forms of interaction. I only wish to see a select few individuals, such as my close friends at lunch.\n\nI miss Amanda profoundly and wish she had not moved to Texas. Similarly, I wish I could see Heather, as well. If she has undergone some positive changes, I would welcome the opportunity to spend a great deal of time with her this summer. It feels as though today and tomorrow cannot pass quickly enough.\n\nReflecting on my own advice, \"never let the sunset on tomorrow before the sun rises today,\" I recognize that I am not fully adhering to it. I had an unusual dream the other night involving someone I am very close to, and I am still trying to interpret its significance.\n\nAt present, I must focus on completing this speech assignment so that I can read and sleep. I am grappling with a deep sense of unease and uncertainty about what is wrong with me. I wish someone could provide me with some clarity.",
    "Sure thing. Here it is:\n\nAbsolutely. I have to retreat to my sanctuary. Solitude calls me. I must reconnect with my true self. I long to smile, to laugh heartily, and to envision impossibilities and fantasies. Regardless of their reality, I crave the dream. This is essential for my well-being. I need my own company, and nothing more.",
    "Uh oh, I'm in that mood. The one where everything and everyone annoys me. I'm getting offline, staying away from everyone, and just working on my speech. No way I'm talking to anyone tonight. Too dangerous. Way too dangerous. I hate when I get in these moods. It's probably because I'm already feeling crappy. OK, going to finish my speech.",
    "Yes! Finally! This wasn't working before for some strange reason, and it was driving me crazy. I feel awful. My stomach really hurts. :( Stupid guys. Seriously, they NEVER have to deal with anything. Grrr.\n\nSo, today was an okay day. Only 4 more days of actual class left. In Wind Ensemble, I went to the writing center and worked on my speech outline. I was amazed that I actually got some work done. Then, there was music theory. Gosh, I can't wait to get away from that class. Seriously, yuck. The teacher just kept talking and talking. It felt like it would never end.\n\nChemistry was okay. We got a ton of really confusing notes, though. Sometimes Mr. K is all right, but other times he just drives me nuts. Health was really boring and pointless, just a lot of busy work. We had to write stories using 15-25 words from the chapter, which felt very pointless.\n\nSpeech was okay. I didn't have to give my speech today. Someone else gave a speech on plastic surgery, which was... interesting. Lunch was okay, and math was boring, though I think I actually understood what we were doing. In Government, we just watched \"12 Angry Men.\"\n\nOverall, it was a pretty boring day. I think I'll work on my speech now so I can eat dinner, read a bit, and go to sleep early. That would be nice. OK, bye!",
    "Good morning! 🤞 I'm really hoping for a smooth day today—fingers crossed I don't have to give that speech and that Mr. A is a no-show. 😂 Just had a funny thought... if Alstadt ever somehow read this, A) I'd probably never make WE again, and B) I'd feel pretty awful—or maybe both! 😬 Yikes. Maybe it’s time to cut down on the Alstadt stories here. I mean, he does get on my nerves, but still. Anyway, off to school I go. Wish me luck! See ya! 🌟",
    "Oh no, this is awful! These images are really disturbing. I feel sick...",
    "I'm really anxious. I haven't had a chance to chat with Alex recently, and the thought of losing him as a friend is troubling. He's such an incredible person, and I can't bear the idea of our conversations ending.",
    "I've always found the phrase \"shifty character\" amusing.",
    "Hey, I finished my music theory composition! Yes! I finally completed something from my list! How awesome is that? I never called the boy I swore I would, but I couldn't work up the courage. Okay, so maybe I was never going to. I just can't do it. I talked to a cool kid on the phone anyway, so overall, it was an okay Sunday evening.",
    "It's interesting—I just realized how rarely I mention my dad. Tonight, someone on the phone asked where he was, almost implying he wasn't around anymore. But he's here, and he's a great guy. I get along well with him and my family overall. Although I don't share personal stuff with my dad like I do with my mom, we still talk. Anyway, I need to quickly gather some research for my final speech, then it's off to bed for me—I'm really tired. Take care!",
    "To-Do List:\n- Complete music theory composition\n- Start and finish the final speech, including the outline\n- Spend some time playing basketball outside\n- Enjoy a cookie with milk\n- Call *Boy* :) (Wishful thinking...)\n\nAlso:\n- Accept that it's not summer yet\n- Buy new earrings\n- Focus on tasks instead of procrastinating through blog writing\n\nMore tasks to come as I think of them.\n\nReflecting on everything... life is really good.",
    "I strongly dislike homework with an intense and burning passion.",
    "I'm really trying hard to avoid doing my homework right now. It's so frustrating, and I really don't want to do it at all. I'm stuck working on my music theory assignment and it's awful. I absolutely hate music theory with a passion. I regret taking the class because I just don't fit in. I'm terrible at writing music and not great at music overall. It's really annoying. On another note, my patience is running thin with someone at the moment. It's becoming increasingly difficult to keep my cool with him, even over small things. He's really getting on my nerves, and it seems like he knows exactly how to push my buttons. Anyway, I'm out of here like the last kid picked in dodgeball. Poor kid. :(",
    "Yes, I have made a decision. It is remarkable how spending merely an hour and a half with close friends can provide such clarity. This evening, I visited Kathryn's house, and we spent time together, engaging in various activities. It was an enjoyable experience, and I truly cherish their company. Although Kelly was not present, the evening was still quite delightful. Furthermore, I had the opportunity to drive, which I found enjoyable. Since I am feeling somewhat tired, I will retire for the night, provided that I am not interrupted by instant messages. I must admit, I have a tendency to get engrossed in conversations on AIM. Nevertheless, such is life.",
    "I can stop pretending to clean now. Why am I so scared of bugs? I saw an ant and freaked out. I sprayed it with Fantastik and now feel bad, but anything with more than four legs terrifies me. Anyway, I'm going to Kathryn's tonight, so I should eat dinner and get ready. I'm content right now.",
    "I'm not sure why I'm so excited to go to Michigan, but I am. I can't wait! Last night, I was talking with Lauren about partying, and I really want to let loose and have some fun. However, I promised myself I wouldn't drink. Sometimes I regret that promise, but I know I can still have fun without drinking. \n\nI guess I just want to feel included. A few months ago, Pat, his friends, and my brother invited me to hang out, but I didn't go because they would be drinking and getting high. Although I know they'll be doing that again, at least Conor doesn't drink, so maybe I'll spend time with him when the others start drinking.\n\nI asked Max if he could bring along a non-drinking guy who isn't interested in Sara. He jokingly said that wasn't possible! Part of my conversation with Lauren was amusing, so I wanted to include it here:\n\nLokiluna13 (11:24:21 PM): hey, I'm a rule breaker all the way\nLokiluna13 (11:24:29 PM): I do drugs all the time and drink\nbaby bear 321 (11:25:37 PM): hahahaha\nbaby bear 321 (11:25:44 PM): can i quote that?\nLokiluna13 (11:25:56 PM): lol\nbaby bear 321 (11:26:00 PM): thats sooo goin in my profile\nLokiluna13 (11:26:08 PM): I do!!\nLokiluna13 (11:26:12 PM): haha\nbaby bear 321 (11:26:35 PM): let me guess\nbaby bear 321 (11:26:43 PM): u drink pop and take advil??\nLokiluna13 (11:26:58 PM): yeah... but both at once, and I'm telling you, you're NOT supposed to do that.\nLokiluna13 (11:27:02 PM): It's dangerous!\n\nHaha, this conversation makes me laugh! Anyway, we have big plans to play a prank on the guys this year. We just need to come up with a really good one. We're also planning to pick up some locals, which will be very amusing.\n\nEek, I have to go now and pretend I'm cleaning. I'll probably write more later.",
    "I mentioned to Chris that I was absolutely certain about Ryan last night, but now...I'm not so sure anymore.",
    "It's like a never-ending game between us, and I'm so tired of it. Three years of playing these games.",

    "I finished my letter to Ryan. Should I give it to him? I'm uncertain.",
    "It's unkind to label anyone as stupid or to suggest throwing dangerous objects at them. Let's choose kindness and find better ways to express ourselves. Haha, sometimes my thoughts get a bit wild!",
    "Woohoo! I'm feeling wild and crazy! I've definitely hit a high point. People say you need drugs and alcohol to get a buzz, but I say just stay up really late! Wheee! Hahaha. Goodnight, everyone!",
    "I don't know who I am, and I've lost myself. It could take years to find you and to find myself. I don't need your answer; I need you to see that it's time to break down these walls between us. \n\nAm I still breathing? Have I lost that feeling? Am I made of glass because you see right through me? You're the only one who sees that I don't know who I am. I can't ask these questions because they can't be answered today. Even if everything falls apart, I'll understand your position on my own. \n\nI don't need your answer; I need you to feel that there are no boundaries between us. \n\nHave we come too far to throw away the past? Will you be waiting for me? I have to ask what we are, but if I ask today, it won't last. So I'll wait for you. \n\nWill we ever feel this good again? Not today. \nWill we ever feel this real again? Not today.\nWill you ever be mine again? Not today. \nWill we ever feel this real again? Not today.\n\nStupid world. People suck.",
    "I had an interesting day, but I've decided not to write about it here.",
    "Haha. I discovered yet another person who reads this thing. Yikes. I seriously need to watch what I write. Although, it doesn’t really matter since this is like my diary, and I don’t put anything super personal in here anyway. \n\nThankfully, I can write about Ryan because he never reads this. I'm concerned about tomorrow. Initially, I was supposed to spend the entire day at Great America with him, but I opted out because a lot of people I know will be there, and I don’t feel like bumping into acquaintances all day. \n\nThen, we planned to do something else, like bowling or catching a movie, but now I'm having second thoughts. If I see him, I think I might start liking him again. I really don’t want to go down that road because a relationship between us just doesn’t work. There was a reason I broke up with him before. Why put myself through that again? It only caused pain for both of us, and it took a while to rebuild our friendship. But I guess I’m not being a good friend if I avoid him. If I do see him, I know there’s a good chance we’ll end up back together by the end of the day. I’ve considered it, but partly because I want to be in a relationship with someone. \n\nAnyway, tonight was fun. I went to Peter’s party. It was decent... although I didn’t know many people, and Chris and Brandon were off playing video games. Luckily, Kelly and Annie were there, and I’m really glad to have them as friends. I ended up leaving the party a bit early and just hanging out with Chris for a while. It was nice.\n\nThat’s about it. I’m just really anxious about tomorrow. I felt like I was being inconsiderate to Chris, listening but not fully present. Sigh. I guess whatever is meant to happen will happen. We'll see, we'll see.",
    "My day was great! I slept in because I had my lunch final and went in later to take my government final. I'm glad I didn't study because I got a 97%. That was awesome.\n\nAfter the final, Kelly, Joanne, John, Kathryn, Mary Clare, and I went out to lunch. We tried three restaurants, but the first two were too full, so we ended up at Einstein's. I thought about getting a peanut butter and jelly bagel but decided to wait until I'm with Diane. Sometimes I feel like Diane doesn't like me or doesn't trust me. I want to be better friends with her, but it doesn’t seem like she wants the same. Oh well, I’m not giving up yet.\n\nAfter Einstein's, we went paddle boating, which was a lot of fun even though it was a bit chilly. One tip: don't try switching seats when you have four people in the boat. Later, we went to Starbucks, but since I don't like coffee, I got a fruit drink. Yum.\n\nKathryn's mom picked us up and drove us to Joanne's place. We hung out, did karaoke, and played spoons with forks, which was dangerous. I cut myself, but Joanne gave me an Elmo band-aid that made my day. I think we might have upset Kathryn, but she didn’t show it.\n\nTonight, I’m going to Peter's party. I wasn't sure about going, but since so many people are going, I decided to give it a try. Chris is driving me there in about an hour. \n\nTomorrow will be great, too. I'm hanging out with Ryan all day. We decided not to go to Great America since so many people we know are going. Anyway, I think I’ll just relax because there’s NO SCHOOL! Woohoo!",
    "Today was dull and boring; there's not much I even want to write about. Heh. Oh well, at least tomorrow will be fun.",
    "My day was excellent, superb, and wonderful! Initially, I was really dreading it. In fact, this was perhaps my easiest day, yet the anticipation was still unnerving. The reason? The presence of Mr. Alstadt, who can be rather unpleasant at times. Unfortunately, it is a truth I must state.\n\nI spent some time in the band room before school. Surprisingly, it was open, which amused me greatly. Remarkably, Mr. Alstadt was absent. \n\nSubsequently, I took my speech final, which I found to be quite manageable. Without any prior studying, I secured a B. This is satisfactory as I will still achieve an A in the class, even with a score as low as 68% on the final.\n\nFollowing that, I attended band class. Since we had already taken our final on Friday, there was nothing to occupy our time. I anticipated that staying would mean sorting commencement music, which needed to dry out after yesterday’s incident. Consequently, Kelly and I decided to venture out. We walked to Burger King for a meal, which was an enjoyable experience. We purchased kids meals and delighted in the accompanying toys. It was quite fun. Upon our return, it appeared that our absence had gone unnoticed. Mr. Alstadt took attendance, but it was of no consequence. With only two days of school left, there was little concern over any repercussions. Moreover, my parents would not mind.\n\nRegrettably, we then proceeded to music theory class. It was more tolerable than I had expected. I managed to prove Mr. Alstadt wrong, which was exhilarating! He claimed that transitioning from A major to C major would not sound pleasant. To my satisfaction, my composition, though perhaps not exceptional, sounded acceptable, thereby contradicting his assertion.\n\nIn conclusion, today was quite eventful. Additionally, Kelly and I received scratch-and-sniff stickers with our kids meals. One of the stickers, featuring a foot, emitted an exceptionally unpleasant odor. Nonetheless, this amusing discovery was a fitting end to the day. I believe I shall now engage in something more constructive.",
    "Today brought about a somewhat somber mood. I awoke at approximately 10 AM and initially couldn't locate my shoes, despite searching the entire house. Eventually, I did find them. I proceeded to take a shower, under the impression that everything was fine since I had found my shoes. However, I soon discovered that my dress had a tear in it. In a bit of a rush, my mother managed to repair it for me, and I arrived on time nonetheless.\n\nOur commencement ceremony took place outside. Fortunately, once we were done performing, we were allowed to go inside, unlike the unfortunate seniors who had to remain outside. It was rather surprising that the ceremony wasn't held indoors from the start. Consequently, our music was ruined, and my hair, dress, and feet got completely soaked.\n\nAfterward, Chris gave me an unexpected ride home, where I changed into dry clothes. We then headed to Chipotle to meet Brandon and Bryan. It was quite enjoyable, and I tried their food for the first time, finding it delicious, although I couldn't finish the entire meal. Subsequently, we visited Coldstone, where I had chocolate ice cream with gummy bears, which was absolutely delightful.\n\nChris and I spent some time driving around and talking before I returned home to attempt studying for math, but finding myself unable to concentrate, I decided to write instead. It was an eventful day. \n\nInterestingly, when friends fear that sharing their thoughts might cause you to dislike them, and then they do share, you might find that their honesty brings you closer instead. It wasn’t what I anticipated—I expected to be upset but found myself more appreciative of their honesty and trust.\n\nI feel quite trusted and trustworthy at this moment. I realize this might be somewhat confusing, and I apologize if it is unclear. Nevertheless, I doubt anyone reads this anyway. That being said, I must attempt to study, though I doubt any progress will be made.",
    "Ugh, tonight has been incredibly painful for me. My heart feels like it's been torn to shreds repeatedly. Just as it starts to heal, it gets ripped apart all over again. The pain is unbearable.",

    "No way I'm letting this bring me down, dag nabbit!",
    "I am uncertain at the moment. Circumstances appear to be quite unfavorable currently. I dined at Pizza Hut this evening with my friends, but the experience did not meet my expectations. I find myself in a particularly bad mood, making it difficult to enjoy activities. I have the sense that my summer is being entirely squandered. I am not sure of the reasons behind these feelings, but they persist. Currently, I am experiencing a mix of frustration and sadness. Perhaps tomorrow will bring an improvement.",
    "Hm, alright...so, while everyone headed off to Germany, which is a bit of a bummer, I've been keeping myself super busy! It's been fantastic! I'm still in touch with Chris and Kelly, and all, but I've also been spending time with my other friends here. Just yesterday, I hit the pool in the middle of the day, and guess what? No sunburn! Well, except for a small spot on my face where I probably missed with the sunscreen, but still! I was thrilled and had a blast! Later, I went to Kathryn's place with Joanne and Kathryn, and we just chilled. It's a bit odd just hanging out with the two of them. Oh well. Then, I had a sleepover at Joanne's last night, which was really fun. Surprisingly, I got a decent amount of sleep, although it wasn't the best sleep since sleeping on the floor is quite painful. Hmmm, we watched The Princess Bride! I'd never seen it before and it was absolutely great! YaY! It was a lot of fun! Also, haha, Joanne can't stand not knowing something. It was hilarious. Kathryn mentioned something that we couldn't tell Joanne, and it drove her wild not knowing. Usually, she's in the loop about everything, so this one secret really got to her. Good times. So today, I've been busy with cleaning and other stuff. Tonight, I'm heading out with Katharine, Diane, and maybe Steve and Jeff. It should be super exciting! :) I must wrap this up. I have quite a bit to do actually.",
    "I don't believe it will ever happen.",
    "My day was fairly decent. I enjoyed giving my dad his presents, which was fun. Besides that, I didn't do much except play the computer game Civilization, which is incredibly addictive!\n\nTomorrow, everyone is leaving, and I’m really going to miss them, especially some of my closest friends. It will be tough without them around. I doubt they’ll miss me, but oh well.\n\nI also cleaned my bathroom today, which I absolutely despise. In fact, I hate cleaning altogether. I hope I can be wealthy enough in the future to hire someone to do it for me, or perhaps marry someone who enjoys cleaning—though that seems unlikely!\n\nI've been chatting with Kelly, and I’m going to miss her and Chris the most. I'll write more later... maybe.",

    "I recently looked at my first blog entry and thought, \"Wow, Catie, you were such a dork.\" It's a bit scary. I wonder if I'll think the same about my posts in seven months. Surprisingly, I've stuck with writing here, even though I've never kept a real diary—it always felt like whining to paper. Somehow, whining to a computer screen is different, and I've kept it up. I don't plan to stop anytime soon. Interesting thoughts, but I'm not in a reflective mood right now. Time to read and wait for a good storm! :)",
    "That was odd—rain, then sun, now clouds. Weird. I wonder if storms will pass through all day. I enjoy storms, as long as they're not deadly. Stormy weather is perfect for snuggling with a blanket, stuffed animals, and a good book. It's fun, even if that's a strange definition of fun.\n\nI can't believe everyone is coming home on Monday. I'm excited, but time has flown by. I've met new people and had a blast. Only 13 days until Michigan, and we're almost definitely going to Italy for Thanksgiving. I'm SO excited! Italy is one of my favorite places in the world. If my mom gets her bonus, we might fly first class. That would be amazing—first class on an overseas flight! As a 5'0\" person, coach isn't terrible, but first class would be awesome. I'm really looking forward to the trip. However, if the marching band goes to the Macy's parade, I'll miss it, which is a bummer. But still, I love Rome.\n\nEverything's too quiet in my house. I should check it out—quiet makes me nervous.",
    "This evening, during a conversation, I was asked if I cry often. It struck me as somewhat amusing, considering the rarity with which it occurs. I cry only when matters of great significance arise, when accumulated emotions become overwhelming, or upon hearing a profoundly beautiful song that evokes deep feelings. Music unveils emotions within me that I wasn't previously aware of, and its power is extraordinary. While I do not intend to pursue music as a career, I am deeply grateful for its presence in my life and hold immense respect for those who create remarkable music. With that said, I now retire for the night.",

    "I'm wide awake and, for once, not in the mood to read. It's strange because I woke up at a reasonable hour today. Maybe I should stop writing here and go chat with my friends. I was talking to about five friends, but all the conversations ended at once. Too bad. Katharine just told me I should go to sleep. She's right, I probably should. Will I? Probably not, unfortunately. I should really take my friends' advice on sleeping; they give good advice.\n\nI heard that Chris, Mike, and both Daves were drinking in Germany. It kind of disappoints me, especially since I heard they got drunk. One of the Daves particularly surprised me. We had talked about drinking before, and he emphatically told me he didn't drink. I remember feeling like I'd offended him with the question at the time. But, in the end, it's their choice, not mine. I guess I lost some respect for Dave, though.\n\nAnyway, I'm off to go talk to my friends because they're cool. I think I'll go to sleep feeling happy. Plus, I finished my book, which is nice. Time to find a new one. Off I go!",
    "Hmmm... Should I dive in or not? Probably not. I'm such a scaredy-cat. More like a headless chicken running around aimlessly!

    "I just realized something: I've always been worried that people might think I'm weird because I go to the park, swing on the swings, and listen to music when I need to think. But you know what? I don't care. Everyone has their own place to think, and that's mine. I don't even know why I chose it; it just relaxes me and helps me filter my thoughts. I tend to overthink, and I can't do that effectively at home. It's not that my family doesn't give me privacy—they do—but I still prefer the park. It's where I go, and I like it, so I don't care if people think I'm weird.",

And by the way, gummy bears are delicious at 2:22 AM.",
    "I didn't sleep last night, but it's no big deal. I'm not visiting Joanne's tomorrow, but don't worry—we will watch it sometime. We've scheduled it for July 9th. It might happen later rather than sooner, but it will definitely happen.\n\nRight now, I'm chatting with someone who seems pretty cool. That's all I'll say about that. Haha. I'm going to finish my conversations and maybe read a bit since I'm not really tired.",
    "Heh. Alright, at this moment, I've chosen neither option. Both are off the table. Haha. Great, I'm back to square one. Dang it. This is frustrating, and so is my computer—it doesn't seem to like me very much. But what does? :) La la la, I enjoyed a grilled cheese sandwich earlier. It was delicious, and tonight I'm having chicken parmesan. Hmm, I wonder how you spell parmesan... Oh well. I think I'm going to go find somewhere else to be a loser rather than on my blog site.",
    "So, I planned to visit Joanne, but she can't hang out because she still has a lot of work to do in her mom's closet. That's fine by me since I'm not feeling too great today. It's just one of those \"meh\" kind of days. I think I'll probably make myself some grilled cheese and maybe read my book or watch TV. I love grilled cheese; I'm seriously addicted to it. \n\nI really should try to get on a better sleep schedule, but I know I'll mess it up again when I go to Michigan. So, it's probably pointless to try, as I refuse to go to bed at 9 PM every night while I'm there. I'm in a strange mood right now; just flung my ponytail holder across the room—so weird. There's not much to talk about. I haven't decided on some things, but I did find out something useful. Maybe I should just forget it all and wait for college. Yay, college! Hopefully, there will be more mature guys there.\n\nJoanne is lucky, though it's amusing. I wonder how they will handle being apart for a whole year next year. Joanne really misses him, and he's only been gone for a week. But I have faith in them; I think they're one of those high school couples that will actually stay together. They're perfect for each other, and I'm very happy for them. :)\n\nAnyway, I think I'm going to make my grilled cheese now and read or something. I rarely sign off on this thing anymore. Oh well.",
    "I've realized something. Guys don't seem to like girls like me. They prefer girls who are mysterious, funny, interesting, or even just seem innocent. Hmmm. I don't want to change who I am, but it's frustrating. Just 16 days...only 16 days left. It'll be great to leave Naperville. I can't wait to ride the jet skis, go tubing, and simply relax in the hammock with a book. :) So refreshing. *Sigh* ARGH! July 11th, why can't you get here sooner??? Oh well. That's life. Hehe. Anyway, time for bed. Goodnight.",
    "It’s a relief that this thing finally works. I may jot down a bit about my night, but I need to keep it short because I want to get some rest before heading to Joanne's at 1:00 tomorrow. The evening was quite uneventful, actually. I had plans to go out with Erica, Brett, and Roger, but they fell through, so I ended up at Joanne's place instead. We watched the first Harry Potter movie; it was decent. Unfortunately, Kathryn spoiled a part of the fifth book. I have this sneaking suspicion she did it intentionally by the way she timed her words. Both Kelly and I were pretty annoyed by it. Regardless, it was an okay night.\n\nOn a positive note, everything is smoothing out with Diane! I'm thrilled because there was an awkward spell between us that I wasn't sure we’d overcome. Interestingly, there's a lot of tension in the air among everyone lately. It feels like people are in dire need of a break from each other. The atmosphere is just...strange.\n\nI really wish my mom were home; I need her advice on a decision that’s been bugging me. It's frustrating not having a confidant who I feel comfortable discussing my personal thoughts with, especially about people I like. There are only a handful of people I trust, and even with them, these conversations aren’t easy.\n\nI’m considering making a list of reasons why I like each person I’m contemplating, but that approach feels a bit mechanical. I have this notion that I should just intuitively know who is right for me. But who knows? Maybe I just need some sleep to clear my head. I was feeling incredibly loopy five minutes ago, but a more serious conversation brought me back down. I do cherish moments when I can be silly without worrying about judgment, though. Feels liberating.\n\nAnyway, it's time to wind down. I’ll probably read a few pages of my book—nothing to do with Harry Potter, though—and then hit the sack. Goodnight!",
    "Ugh... I wrote a whole post, and Blogger didn't publish it.",
    "Hmm. I'm really not sure now... I speak to one person and make up my mind, but then I talk to the other. Ugh. I dislike making decisions.",
    "I miss my cat so much. :( I really, really miss her. I wish she was here with me. She'd totally be right by my side, and I could tell her everything.",
    "Oh my gosh, today was such an awesome day out with my mom! We had so much fun! I found the perfect furniture set that I am absolutely in love with, but it doesn’t have the exact bed I want. Ugh! But I love everything else about it, so I think I’ll just get that set anyway and maybe find an unfinished bed to paint a fun color or match it with the furniture. I can’t wait to get creative!\n\nI’m heading out again soon and trying to decide if I should wear something nice, but my comfy pants are calling my name. I adore them! They make me so happy. :)\n\nCan you believe it’s only been 12 days since summer started? It feels so much longer! It hasn't even been two weeks yet! YAY though!! I am beyond excited for Michigan!!! AHHH! I seriously can’t contain my excitement! Not only will I get to see people I miss so much, but I’ll also have time to dive into Harry Potter! YaY!!! \n\nGrr, Blogger is acting up and not posting my stuff. Oh well, I’m sure it’ll work eventually. Blogger can be so weird sometimes…",
    "I sincerely hope she can find it in her heart to forgive me. I genuinely enjoyed spending time with her, but I was just in a rough mood that day. I even suggested we visit Great America sometime this summer. I feel terrible about the way I acted. I'm truly sorry, Diane. My mood was bad, and I wrongly directed my frustration at you. That's what I'll explain to her. I believe she might understand, as she's likely familiar with having bad days herself. At least, I hope she is.",
    "Oh no, now Diane thinks I’m upset with her because of Pizza Hut. Ugh, this is such a mess! The truth is, I did have fun at Pizza Hut, but I was in such a terrible mood beforehand that I couldn’t really enjoy it. I feel awful about letting my mood ruin the time we had together. I’m definitely going to call her later to apologize. She didn’t deserve to have my gloominess dumped on her, especially after being so sweet and inviting me out. That invite was honestly the highlight of my day. Hopefully, when I talk to her, she’ll understand and forgive me.",
    "Oh great, now Diane thinks I'm upset with her because of Pizza Hut or something. :( It's not that I didn't enjoy my time at Pizza Hut, but I was in a bad mood beforehand and couldn't let myself have a good time. Oh well. I plan to call her later and apologize. I didn't intend to take my bad mood out on her, and I truly appreciated her invitation. That was probably the one positive aspect of that day. Anyway, I'll talk to her and apologize, and hopefully, she'll forgive me.",
