    "The world has been shattered by Russia’s attack on Ukraine in the past few days. Ukraine’s forces have put up remarkable resistance to this attack, but the war is entering an even bloodier phase. Europe could be witnessing the first major military invasion in years. Many people have been displaced, and many Ukrainian citizens have fled neighboring countries for peace. Gunshots and artillery fires have been raining down on residential areas in Ukraine, with several media houses and newspapers reporting the events and sharing the news with the rest of the world. Various newspapers have reported the news differently, with the difference seen in headlines, videos and images posted. The two newspapers covering the events in Ukraine are the New York Times and Le Monde, a French newspaper. While New York Times and Le Monde report the same event, the two use very different terms to describe similar activities. In the recent takeover of the city of Kharkiv by the Russian forces, for example, the NYT headline read “Russian Troops Take Over Kharkiv,” Le Monde , on the other hand, read “La Russie A Envahi Kharkiv” to mean “Russia Has Invaded Kharkiv.” Recently a video of Ukrainian citizens making Molotov cocktail Petrol bombs was shared. The headline in NYT read, “Ukraine Prepare Molotov Cocktail In Kyiv.” Le Monde ‘s headline read “Ukrainian Resistance Using Molotov Bombs.” Because headlines are the deciding factor for people to read an article, newspapers make them enticing. The New York Times uses headlines that suggest this is another world war, while Le Monde downplays the illegality of what Russia is doing. The differences seen in the headlines of the two newspapers are all for the attraction of their audiences; each magazine writes eye-catching unique topics.",
    "Charles Schwab is a for-profit Corporation whose main business is savings and loans. The company provides banking and asset management services, and financial advisory. It has several subsidiaries – Charles Schwab & Co., Inc., Charles Schwab Investment Management, Inc., TD Ameritrade, Inc., and TD Ameritrade Clearing, Inc., which are all limited liability companies (“The Charles Schwab Corporation,” 2021). This paper aims to analyze the form of business in Charles Schwab Corporation (CSC). Charles Schwab is a corporation, which is a form of business with some distinctive features. Firstly, its officers are agents, unlike its directors and shareholders, which means that the latter are not involved in the company’s current strategic, managerial and other business decisions (“Corporation,” 2022). Secondly, the corporation is managed by the board of directors who have the right to appoint the officers. This approach creates a balance of managerial forces, since CEOs and CFOs are directly involved in the work processes, and the board of directors, in extreme cases, has the right to dismiss them by voting. In the corporation, shareholders are free to transfer ownership, which means that in critical situations such as bankruptcy, the corporation can be sold to another owner. This outcome is possible because the corporation is an organization that creates an opportunity for investors to profit by investing, unlike an LLC (“Forming a corporation,” 2022). Finally, in corporations, the income is taxed twice: the first time at the corporate level, and a second time if dividends are distributed to shareholders. Thus, the form of business in Charles Schwab Corporation was analyzed. The CSC is a corporation with several subsidiaries and conducts business following the requirements for a corporation form of organization. A distinctive feature of corporations is the board of directors, which has an indirect influence on daily decision-making. Still, in critical cases, it can appoint new officers to manage the company. Corporations can also transfer property rights in the event of bankruptcy or other cases.",
    "The work of a clinical or medical office worker is characterized by a combination of a large number of administrative operations with medical activities. Primarily, these professionals are office assistants filling out paperwork and interacting with staff (“How to become a medical office assistant,” 2021). As a result, I will be approaching interviews for this job in a professional business style. While the fitting suit can be expensive, I already have the proper formal attire. Using my black formal suit, shoes, and minimal accessories, I can make the right impression without reducing my budget. In warm weather, I can go to an interview right in a suit, and in cold weather, I can add my usual outerwear, for example, an overcoat. Work clothes, theoretically, may require additional investments and purchases. All healthcare workers, including office workers, must wear a special uniform called scrubs, consisting of a short-sleeved shirt and trousers. This uniform is relatively cheap, and a single set of scrubs can be found on Amazon for about $20-$40 (“Medical assistant’s uniform,” 2019). Most of all, in this context, one needs to take care of shoes since these specialists sometimes have to stand or walk a lot. A good pair of closed-toe shoes can cost around $100, but I have tennis shoes that fit the dress code (“Medical assistant’s uniform,” 2019). However, it must be taken into account that many medical institutions issue uniforms on their own, considering them as consumables, so the choice of purchasing a uniform will depend on the rules of a particular hospital. In any case, it is simple and easy to wear, so it will not entail high costs. Reflecting on the points studied and prepared, I want to note that the new information will affect my budget and life plan very little. In the best case, if the hospital issues uniforms, I won’t have to spend any money at all, as I can wear my existing suit for the interview and shoes for work. In the worst case, I will still be within the budget when I have to buy everything for work. Therefore, I can put that $200 aside and mentally prepare for possible demands from my interviewers. In addition, this study showed that the issue of clothing for interviews and work is not a problem for me, and I am already prepared for it in many respects.",
    "Carl Jung identifies the mother complex with an innate feeling of care at the center of the emotional attachment between a mother and a child. However, in the absence of such an attachment, an archetype develops where someone’s mother fails to satisfy the essential demands associated with the relationship. The outcome leads the victim, the child, to seek comfort elsewhere (Bobroff 35). At the core of the mother complex is the mother archetype, meaning that in every emotional attachment, between the child and the mother, on the one hand, an archetype nourishing and security image manifests. On the other hand, an archetype that devours possessiveness, deprivation, and darkness comes out (Bobroff 36). In the film Every Secret Thing , a complex emotional attachment between Alice and her mother exists and forms the underlying relationship between the two and the association with the kidnaps taking place. The complex relationship between Alice and her mother places Alice at the center of the kidnapping. Hellen is disgusted by Alice to the point of considering Ronnie her child of choice, a position that makes Alice deeply insecure. Moreover, the tension in interracial affairs is associated with the second kidnapping and having born a biracial child while in prison, and given it up for adoption, Alice becomes the primary suspect in the case (Berg). Alice’s mother, the mastermind behind the kidnap, in the first and second cases, and murder, in the first case, plants evidence to ensure Alice stands out as the main suspect. Hellen, through betrayal and deception, purposely Alice ends up in prison (Berg). Further, compared to the indifference in Ronnie’s parents, there is no emotional attachment between the parents and their daughters. As the film comes to an end, the audience learns that not only were Alice and Ronnie falsely imprisoned, the justice system failed to prove that Helen is the killer.",
    "The article describes a recent Chicago hot dog restaurant incident that can be considered an ethical issue. The incident involved a man who was asked to wear a mask to use the restaurant’s services (Sutton, 2022). In response, the man offended the restaurant employee by throwing snow in their face several times (Sutton, 2022). Additionally, the offender broke the glass door with an unknown object (Sutton, 2022). This incident can be considered an ethical issue because the offender’s actions were disproportional to the situation, apart from the obvious property damage offense. Furthermore, throwing snow at an employee might not count as illegal; however, it is blatantly disrespectful toward an individual. A utilitarian point of view would consider this incident wrong by examining the consequences of the offender’s actions. The seeming reason behind the offender’s behavior is the employee’s request to wear a mask, which is the state’s mandate. Utilitarianism would view the restaurant visitor’s decision to commit an offense against the employee and the restaurant’s property, starting with the consequences of these actions. Since the result is a broken glass door and an innocent employee that suffered, the consequences are harmful. As such, from the utilitarian point of view, the actions can be considered wrong. The Kantian moral theory views an issue as irrational since following the moral law and duty is rational behavior. Offering an innocent individual and damaging the restaurant’s property can be immoral. As such, dismissing the moral law renders the offender irrational in the eyes of a follower of a Kantian moral theory. I believe that utilitarianism is the most logical way to conclude this ethical problem. The reason for that is that negative consequences for anybody can be the best moral compass for almost any decision. The Kantian moral theory is based on moral law, which can be subjective in some people’s minds. As such, according to Kantian theory, some people might disagree that the incident is an ethical issue. In contrast, according to utilitarianism, a negative impact on any individual renders an action wrong.",
    "The primary source for this study is the general medical journal The Lancet. It publishes the survey data and provides statistics and a comparative analysis of the obtained quantitative information. The Economist can be seen as a secondary source that describes research with less digital content. The study represents a decrease in the HIV infection rate of girls in school by stabilizing their families’ financial difficulties. The World Bank funded the study to demonstrate the value of money in reducing the spread of HIV among young, poor girls. The study was authored by Berk Özler, Lead Economist and Poverty Research Manager. The medical journal The Lancet presented statistics based on a survey in the Zomba district of Malawi (G.C. 2). The Economist later summarized the study with the most critical findings from the analysis. Thus, 1,300 unmarried girls aged 13 to 22 took part in the study. This is a sufficient number of subjects to consider the prevalence of HIV in poor areas. The sampling took place with the help of a computer, so the girls fell into different experimental groups randomly. Thus, a group stood out in which girls and their families were given small amounts of money every month, girls paid to attend school, and girls left without financial support. Based on the study, it can be concluded that the subjects who received the money in both groups showed a significant reduction in the spread of the virus. However, test subjects with no money were forced to look for a sugar daddy. Therefore, in this group of issues, the statistics of the spread of HIV were preserved. Thus, the drug called money is adequate and affects the spread of STDs. The implication is that the global community needs funding to stop the spread of HIV. However, research and further assistance to young girls have several limitations. Firstly, it is hard to understand how much money each person needs to stop looking for sugar daddies and move on with their lives. Moreover, the study was conducted over 18 months, so it is impossible to assess how it will work in the long term",
    "Horror films have become one of the fundamental genres of cinema, the popularity of which is not inferior to the other styles. The reason for it is the specific reaction of the target audience, namely a powerful emotional impulse. Moreover, it becomes a psychological relief for some persons, which helps to distract from one’s problems. Horror films are not the modern version of public lynching; they formulate a way for people to obtain a strong emotional response through fear. Fear is a primary human emotion, which manifests itself as an instinct for self-preservation, namely a reaction to a potential threat. It may seem strange for one that people pay money to feel such an unpleasant emotion while watching horror films. However, in the essay Why We Crave Horror Movies , Stephen King argued that people aim to re-establish their feelings of essential normality (King, 1). In other words, one tries to reset their ordinary feelings for many reasons. Some are distracting from problems in this way, others get a dose of adrenaline, and sometimes horror films become a way to throw out their emotions in a movie theater and not on other people. Any art must evoke emotion and promote the individual experiencing ethical pleasure. Watching horror movies seems to have nothing to do with the ethical aspect. However, the success of horror movies, to more extent than other genres, depends on the audience’s reaction (Glasby, 7). The strong reaction makes horror films stand out in terms of the criteria for assessing art. Indeed, few people can lag behind absolutely indifferent when watching scary scenes. Besides, the powerful emotional response makes horror films so popular and successful nowadays. To conclude, one identified that horror films do not formulate a form of modern public lynching. They are the one’s method to receive the bright, emotive response. There are various reasons for it, beginning from obtaining psychological discharge and ending to distracting from reality and one’s urgent problems. The audience’s reaction is the key point to evaluating the horror film’s success and why it is considered art.",
    "A mutation is a change in the genome of an organism. Most commonly, mutations are defined as changes in DNA structure that occur due to disruption of the sequence of genes or the emergence of new genes. In this paper, I would like to talk about spontaneous mutations. Spontaneous mutations occur by chance – for example if a sheep is suddenly born in a flock of sheep with shorter legs; such mutations can also occur in humans. The ADRB1 gene, for example, is responsible for regulating the amount of sleep a person needs each night to function properly. Most humans need eight hours of sleep or more, but about 5% of the population enjoys a slightly different mutant version. Tests done on a mother and daughter who had the mutation revealed the ability to sleep only 4 to 6 hours each night (Servick, 2019). This mutation refers to a type of genomic mutation. The protein encoded by the mutation is a receptor for norepinephrine. This mutation is dominant, autosomal, and beneficial in its effect on the viability of individuals. Changes in the ADRB1 gene occur primarily in humans. However, they can also be in animals, although no studies have yet been conducted. Such a mutation does not affect the human population in the general world. This is mainly due to the fact that it is not dangerous and is not life-threatening to its carriers. Thus, such a mutation is only a positive addition to the life abilities of a human carrier. This mutation is sporadic and is not a dominant trend in population genome changes despite its dominance. I find this example interesting because natural changes in the human genome open up new possibilities for the population. Thus, studying such changes is essential for human development and a deeper study of human capabilities.",
    "In his graphic novel, Spiegelman uses a literary device known as anthropomorphism to show the difference between races, including Americans, the Germans, and the Jews. This device makes the severe issue seem simpler to understand, and the readers pay more attention to the ideas expressed by the author. In Maus , Spiegelman portrays the horrors of the holocaust and reminds the readers that the holocaust’s victims and survivors also had their own lives and dreams. The first section to be discussed is Chapter 1 – “The Sheik.” In this section, the main character Artie asks his father Vladek to tell him about his life during the war. Instead of describing the horrors Vladek faced during the holocaust, he prefers to tell his son about his happy and careless life in 1935 (Spiegelman, 1980, pp. 13-23). This desire to recall the good old days proves that the victims of the war prefer to remember the pleasant times. The second section is Chapter 3- “Prisoner of War.” In this part of the novel, Vladek talks about the first events he witnessed as a soldier. Interestingly, Vladek remembers the name of a soldier he killed, and this detail shows that even during the terrible events, one’s brain catches the small and unmeaningful things (Spiegelman, 1980, p. 50). Finally, Vladek says that he was reunited with his family, and this event matters more than what he experienced as a prisoner of war. The third part to analyze is Chapter 5 – “Mouse Holes.” This section shows that, for many mice, war is a series of difficult decisions that must be made in order for them to try to survive (Spiegelman, 1980). Even when parents learn about the death of their children, they need to keep a cold mind so as not to get caught by the cats. To draw a conclusion, one may say that this graphic novel is a unique literary work about World War II. In these comic drawings, Spiegelman managed to portray the horrors of the holocaust and those little but meaningful things that supported the victims and helped some of them to remain hopeful. Despite the fact that the war was full of violence and murders, the author shows the irony of the situation – the Germans are just animals who imagine they are better than others.",
    "The creation of a web-based system to store the university’s information on students and their transcripts presents certain risks that need to be addressed in the feasibility report. Using the standard risk evaluation process, it is possible to differentiate the risks into two large groups. These are risks to the continuation and completion of the project and risks to the end product’s performance after the project has been completed. The risks to the continuation and completion of the project are as follows:   * Unforeseen delays and time expenditures. It is possible that the project’s implementation will be more complex than anticipated, requiring more time;   * Individuals participating in the project might become sick and slow down production;   * The available hardware and software may malfunction. The risks for the performance of the end product are as follows:   * The product might not be secure enough to be allowed to work with personal student data;   * The product would be economically unfeasible to run;   * The product would not perform adequately to the university’s requirements. Time-related problems could be identified by comparing the progress made with the timeline developed before starting the project. Functionality and requirements risks can be discovered by matching the product against its requirements for it, as well as through testing during specific project milestones. Potential time constraints and personnel/hardware breakages can be accounted for by allocating more time to the project than initially estimated to allow for replacements to be made. Countering the risks associated with site performance would be more difficult and largely have a reactionary nature, should some of them not be discovered and remedied during the product testing phase.",
    "The computation of the three ratios Return on Assets (RoA) Return on Equity (RoE) Profit Margin The purpose and information conveyed by each ratios The three ratios presented and computed in the previous section represent vital profit generation indicators for a modern commercial organization. The return on assets (RoA) shows how well the company utilizes the entirety of its assets, including the borrowed ones, to generate financial returns. The return on equity is largely similar to this metric, but it does not consider the debt of the company (Gallo, 2016). Finally, the profit margin is one of the most important indicators of financial health, as it draws a direct comparison between sales and profits, showing how much the company actually earns from its operations. ABC Company review on three ratios First of all, the ABC Company’s business model can be deemed successful, as it generates adequate profits. Optimal returns on equity and assets show that the investors can reasonably expect returns on their participation in the company’s financing. The profit margin is also considerable, which means that this aspect of the firm is handled well. The profitability of the company Overall, the ABC Company remains a profitable enterprise that successfully converts its assets into revenues. The profit margin is over 50%, which is commendable, even though the overall turnover is below $1 million. Therefore, the business model on its own functions well, allowing the ABC Company to retain a stable position on the market. However, it may not suffice for the sustained growth in the long-term. ABC Company financial successful While the ABC Company’s financial statement may present positive indicators, it would be unwise to consider the company in isolation. Instead, it appears to interesting to compare the entity’s performance against the industry’s leaders to identify the areas in which it excels or where the improvements are needed. First of all, the return on assets is provided by Rose (2022), indicating that the industry’s average was set at 9.1-9.3% across the past four years. The ABC Company’s figures are considerably higher at the moment with 28.3%, but it is important to note that its absolute cash flows are not on par with the industry’s leaders. Thus, it is possible that the ABC Company’s ratios will become lower as the entity continues to grow. This difference becomes particularly evident when the income levels are compared with the industry’s average figures. As far as net income is concerned, the industry has averaged at $4.7 million in 2020. The ABC Company is far from this level, as its net income is only $77,000, which implies that it still has a long growth phase ahead. Furthermore, the industry’s leaders, such as Williams-Sonoma, have hundreds of millions of sales, whereas the ABC Company only has half-a-million. As the total assets of the company increase, there is no guarantee that its profit margins and returns on investment will remain equally high. Under these circumstances, the emphasis will be on maintaining the profitability of operations above the average level across the industry.",
    "Portraying the lives of gods and depicting relationships between them, as well as their interactions with humans, both “Iliad” and “Metamorphosis” elaborate on the theme of power abuse by those at the helm. In “Iliad,” Agamemnon has to face retribution due to his constant abuse of power: “be ready, that I be not left,/Alone of all the Greeks, without my prize” (Homer, 762 B. C.). Likewise, in “Metamorphosis,” various deities display complete disrespect for those of lesser power: “What had escaped the waves, now feared the flame” (Ovid, 8 B.C.). However, unlike the “Iliad,” “Metamorphosis” rarely demonstrates the comeuppance that deities have to face for their negligence of mortals’ needs (Homer, 762 B. C.; Ovid, 8 B. C.). Therefore, while thematically similar, “Iliad” and “Metamorphosis” represent slightly different perspectives on the problem o power abuse. The theme of mortals’ protection, which is central both to “Iliad” and “Metamorphosis,” remains essential nowadays as well. Namely, a range of contemporary leaders appear to have tremendous amounts of power due to their political influence, their economic one, or a combination of both (Homer, 762 B. C.; Ovid, 8 B. C.). For instance, the disregard for human rights in countries such as China, where leaders attain the status of god-like creatures, can be seen as similar to the one in the “Iliad” and “Metamorphosis.” However, what makes “Metamorphosis” slightly less effective in this regard is the comedic manner in which it portrays the abuse of mortals. In turn, “Iliad,” being a more serious work, produces a much greater impact by condemning the violence of omnipotent gods toward humans, which is more in line with the current concept of power abuse. Nevertheless, both the “Iliad” and “Metamorphosis” carry an important message and a deep meaning. Providing an insight into power dynamics within Ancient Greek society, they also help recognize similar patterns in the modern community.",
    "The article of Zulaika (2022) presents the impact of COVID-19 lockdowns on adolescent pregnancy and school dropout among secondary school girls in Kenya. The cases of teenage pregnancy started in Kenya after the country-wide school closure that started from March 2020 and lasted until January 2021. Zulaika (2022) examine to what extent the pandemic affected sexual and reproductive health of adolescents in Rarieda subcounty. The study shows there was a limited involvement of health administrators on the issue of pregnancy among school girls. Teenagers lack sexual education and are not aware of different methods of protection. Health administrators should find this issue important as early pregnancy can be dangerous for girls’ health and lead to various socio-economic problems in the future. Moreover, if such a rate of adolescent pregnancy continues to increase, there would be less educated females in Kenya. Zulaika (2022) also mentions that stress level of pregnant teenagers is high, affecting mental as well as physical health of young future mothers. To tackle this issue, Zulaika (2022) suggests implementing population-level emergencies on girls that are going to school. Students should be educated for the basics of sexual education and for the side effects of sexual life. Furthermore, the article points out that infectious diseases can be spread rapidly if school girls do not know the importance of contraceptives. As such, there is a need to the national project of informing school students and their parents about sexual and reproductive issues. The effects of COVID-19 on teenage pregnancy are negative, causing additional social and economic problems not only for the pregnant girls and their families but also for the whole country.",
    "Primarily, one should note that the country that I chose to perform the assignment is France. Undoubtedly, there are many consulates of France in the United States. However, to take the remains to the “homeland,” it is required to contact a special consulate general located in California, Los Angeles. In this context, a “mourner” should arrange a meeting in the office with a specialist two days in advance to discuss all the details and points regarding the dispatch of human remains and sealing an urn ( Shipment of cremated remains , 2019). Thus, the Consulate General of France in Los Angeles is one of the most relevant places to ask for help to remove “remnants.” Accordingly, I have to provide the following merchandise to the family in the future. First of all, it is necessary to prepare a package of particular documents. For instance, they include a death certificate of a loved one in the US, a medical report, and a certificate of cremation and sealing. Moreover, an attestation of the absence of extraneous attachments and closed sealing of the urn, a certificate of the lack of infectious diseases from the deceased, and a permit to import remains will be required. It is also essential to have a person’s permission to request repatriation and a certified French translation of the death and cremation certificate. Secondly, this family needs an urn with the ashes of the dead, located in a special airtight container. Moreover, there are not too complicated requirements regarding the transportation of the urn in France. A person must apply directly to the French consulate in the US and prepare a package of documents set out above. There are several airlines engaged in the transportation of ashes, one of the most reliable and well-known is Air France-KLM. In most cases, the tame frames are based on an agreement between funeral companies in America and the destination country. The consulate member I have had to communicate with is Julie Duhaut-Bedos. In addition, the flight booking service would be accompanied by the consulate’s help. Depending on the distance, it is necessary to book a direct flight or with a transfer. Furthermore, each airline offers individual conditions for the transportation of special cargo. The urn with the ashes of a loved one would be carefully sealed and placed in a special lockable box with dense walls. Transporting the loved one by plane is possible only in the luggage compartment.",
    "Amazon has grown to become one of the most important companies in the US. Millions of people rely on the highly efficient deliveries and cheap prices. Moreover, the company has turned into one of the largest employees, as numerous Amazon fulfillment centers are scattered across the country. With such scale, a wide range of issues inevitably arise. Recently the multiple complaints concerning the way Amazon treats it workers have managed to draw public attention. Therefore, a dedicate analysis is need in order to understand what kind of working conditions and atmosphere the IT giant provides. Key Problems: Job Dissatisfaction and High Turnover Rates Guaranteeing $15 an hour may be a nice incentive for people in poor neighborhoods, but only in the short run. Motivating people to work better by gradually increasing their pay would be not only more appealing and psychologically comfortable, but also highly beneficial in the long run. Task assignments and worker motivation interact through the extent of labor market competition – that is, the possibility of moving to another firm (Bar-Isaac & Levy, 2022). Therefore, Amazon should consider applying a more traditional approach to motivating workers, which will help to reduce current turnover rates. Cause: Poor Motivation Techniques E-commerce is no longer as lucrative as it used to be a decade ago. It has become the primary way people do shopping, especially in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic. Therefore, numerous new companies have jumped at the opportunity and managed to extend their market shares. Thus, Amazon is determined to cut costs substantially by various means, including the construction of its fulfillment centres in the neighborhoods that have not fully recovered from recent economic recessions. According to Kinicki (2020), turnover is one of the major outcomes that should be considered while tailoring the set of inputs. Currently, the company’s turnover rate continues to be extremely high. Desired Solution: Utilizing More Conservative Motivation Frameworks The emphasis on fear, the discouragement of camaraderie and many other Amazon’s current policies substantially undermine employee’s motivation and the company’s public image. The desired potential solution plan includes the introduction of systematic pay raises, the enhancement of bonus systems and changing the way employees are timed. These steps will help the IT giant to motivate employees in a much more positive and respectful way.",
    "American slavery arose as a way of exploiting labor within capitalism but gradually took shape in an autonomous socio-economic and political structure. Over time, a liberation movement began, which implied the illegality and unethical “ownership” of people. However, even after official emancipation, the slaves were dependent on the state and slave owners in the past, with a lack of resources for subsistence. Without documents, financial resources, and moral support, it was difficult for new members of society to integrate into a standard life. Additionally, discrimination and lack of inclusion as a phenomenon continued to exist. Slavery was abolished as a result of the Civil War between the northern and southern states. The passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to the US Constitution in January 1865 brought a permanent end to slavery in the US, making it illegal and anti-constitutional. Currently, this phenomenon in the United States is considered one of the most shameful episodes in the history of the country. At the same time, an urgent question arises whether the state should have compensated the slaves for the material and spiritual damage that was caused to them in the process. Even if slave labor is not officially permitted and the slaves are freed, without the provision of basic resources for life, survival is unlikely. The concept and attitude of society also affect the acceptance rate of new members. In the case of unequal chances of receiving the same benefits, the slaves in the past have more difficulties, challenges, and complexities on the path of integration. In this regard, the new slaves were not truly emancipated, as they were still dependent on a source of resources for subsistence.",
    "The present essay analyzes a manual for the use of a dishwasher developed by Bosch. The first positive characteristic of this manual is that it contains a lot of illustrations that make it easier to understand how to use the dishwasher. For instance, the manual depicts how to add rinse aid, arrange crockery in the dishwasher, and remove baskets (Bosch, n.d.). Thus, the manual is focused on its audience, who is not expected to know very well how to use the dishwasher. Besides, the section on the installation of the machine is not detailed and contains only fundamental suggestions. Hence, the authors of the manual expect it to be installed by professionals. Another reason that proves that this manual focuses on the audience is that the largest part of the text is presented in the form of bullet points. Therefore, a user could easily and quickly find all necessary information in the manual. The manual is problem-oriented, purposeful, and persuasive because it addresses precise issues that users might face. For example, it explains how to select the right program for specific types of crockery and food remains, cancel and stop the program, and check the condition of the machine. Even though the text is written without technical terminology, the manual remains professional. This conclusion is based on the fact that in the instruction, one could find answers to a wide range of specific questions. The manual contains instructions on how to use the dishwasher, take care of it, install, dispose of wastes, and what to do in case of a failure. As it has already been mentioned, the examined manual is designed-centered. It contains numerous illustrations, schemes, and bullet points that make it easy to read. What is more, near the paragraphs with warnings, a related sign is inserted. The exclamation point in a red triangle draws the attention of a reader and makes him or her focus on the content of the section. The manual is also logical: the first section is dedicated to the components of the dishwasher; in the second one, the manual tells the audience how to put tableware in it. Afterward, there is information on how to add water softener, salt, and rinse aid. Finally, the manual explains how to take care of the device and how to act in case of a problem.",
    "Referring to competition’s nature, the competitive landscape covers multiple aspects, including, the number and size of companies, their weaknesses and strengths, barriers to the market entry and exit, and substitutes’ threats. In the present day, it substantially differs from the traditional competitive environment that relied on large advertising budgets and economies of scale – and it continues to transform due to rapid technological progress. Due to constantly changing conditions, the contemporary competitive mindset is characterized by innovation, integration, flexibility, and speed. It relies on data in business decision-making in order to have competitive advantages and create transparent business processes, adapts to the latest market technologies, and aims to improve the consumer experience. In general, in order to stay competitive, the majority of companies focus on customer-oriented operations to meet people’s demands and strengthen brand awareness and loyalty. There are several drivers of the current competitive landscape, including new business models, consumer protection, price transparency, hypercompetition, and environmental awareness, however, the primary ones are flexibility and technologies. In other words, companies cannot implement only one strategy for stable growth and development and should use all technological advantages to outperform competitors. Thus, those companies that are flexible, apply various approaches, and see opportunities may succeed even in tough economic conditions. For instance, NVIDIA, a multinational technology company that designs graphics processing and chip units for professional markets, gaming, and mobile computing, performs excellently regardless of the COVID-19 recession. The company has taken advantage of a global lockdown and people’s self-isolation focusing on remote computing services and video gaming. For instance, approximately seven million Nintendo gaming consoles with NVIDIA’s chips were sold in the third quarter of 2020 (Fitch, 2020). This case demonstrates that in the current competitive landscape, those companies who may rapidly adapt to any conditions will be able to stay productive and highly demanded.",
    "Guaman Poma witnessed the injustices of the colonial government and personally suffered by its hands. He was the descendant of Incan noblemen who grew up after the conquest of Peru by the Spanish. His family was stripped of their lands and titles, and his attempts to regain them were continuously rebuffed by the colonial government (Kilroy-Ewbank, n.d.). Although he initially worked with the colonialists, Poma was exiled for supposedly false claims of nobility and then decided to publicly denounce the Spanish treatment of natives. He published a 1200-page illustrated document addressed to the Spanish king, chronicling the Andean way of life before invasion and the abuses they had suffered since under the Conquistadors. Poma’s manuscript illustrates the full horrors of colonialism and argues that the Spanish were foreign settlers who had no right to take control of the land God had given to Peruvians. He proposes a system of political organization wherein the government is representative of its people and adapted to their practical needs (Kilroy-Ewbank, n.d.). Poma has thus made a significant contribution to the discussions of liberty, political representation, social responsibility, and self-determinacy of individual states. His notion that the government should be created for and by the people that have historically occupied the land it rules over is strikingly modern. Furthermore, Poma’s work completely refutes the idea that Europeans brought civilization and political organization to the Incas. This interpretation is revealed as only a hypocritical pretense to justify violence, economic exploitation, and cultural erasure as a means of political control. It portrays how an entire way of life was completely destroyed and lost as its people were deprived of their freedom and forced to assimilate. Although Poma admires the moral standards the Spanish purport to uphold, he shows that they have not actually measured up to them.",
    "Background The action of the prayer effect is based on the regularities and peculiarities of cognitive processes. It is based on two attention abilities, namely, switching and concentration. In the course of prayer, people switch and focus on an area of higher spirituality. The requirement of regularity and systematic recitation of worship leads to frequent repetition of concentration on religious categories, strengthening the mental connection with God. Froese and Jones (2021) wrote in their article that prayer strengthens one’s faith in the supernatural and, therefore, it is a session of faith. In addition, public prayer has long been used as a tool to influence the political arena (Froese & Jones, 2021). Therefore, one can consider this phenomenon as a weapon, sacred and supernatural. The same idea that prayer is a weapon, and used politically, is also found in Martin’s article. Religion is familiar with precedents when it was possible to defeat enemy troops by force of turning to God (Martin, 2019). For example, in A.D. 174, by the power of prayer, a Roman legion was able to discover a spring of water, and the flood that followed washed away the enemies (Martin, 2019). In general, both authors emphasize that prayers serve as weapons and that their use brings people closer to God. Participants in the ritual often experience a sense of social acceptance and emotional uplift after the prayer is completed. The rhythmic and systematic repetition of prayers reinforces the ideals and guidelines of a particular religion (Froese & Jones, 2021). Martin also wrote about it in his article, he came to the conclusion that these circumstances determine why prayer can be used as an epiphany strategy. Proactivity manifests itself as a response to a stimulus; a prayer of this type responds to a vision for fate. Due to such rituals, it is possible to create the future by praying (Froese & Jones, 2021). People often asked God to protect them in battle throughout early Christian history. Prayers were used to ease the fear of the Israelites, strengthening their resolve long before Jesus was born (Martin, 2019). The initiators of such prayers were used to reassure soldiers before skirmishes. It was assured that they would be guaranteed a place in heaven if they won (Martin, 2019). Both authors mention that requests for intervention in this way have existed throughout Christian history. They are unanimously convinced that prayers are inherently proactive; there are no significant differences between their positions. Summary Repentance In his second letter to the Corinthians, Paul refers to repentance as sorrow for God’s sake, which leads to salvation (2 Corinthians 7:10). Repentance in Paul’s understanding is when one does not return to sin again. Repentance cleanses the soul, and a clean soul, in turn, is able to more fully receive the grace of the Holy Spirit.

    "Supporters of relativism believe that morality in the objective sense does not exist. The moral norms adopted in society are not obligatory for adherence and execution. In absolute terms, the concepts of evil and good are nothing more than fiction. In this regard, researcher Porus noted that moral relativism could easily degenerate into permissiveness (Bush and Moss, 2020). Moreover, people who adhere to this point of view can be perceived as the ones trying to devalue moral norms to the lowest possible level, will not attempt to seek compromises and negotiate on mutually beneficial terms. On the contrary, objectivism states that there is right and wrong that do not depend on someone’s opinions or other factors. In this sense, moral standards are believed to be propounded and everlasting, not created by humans. There are many philosophical variations and interpretations of objectivism, but the key idea lies in proclaiming one genuine truth. This evidently opposes the concept of relativism in every aspect (Bush and Moss, 2020). Objectivism, however, admits that some moral norms may change, but at thy core, any rules and standards evolve around an unaltered understanding of bad and good. I find relativism more convincing despite some flaws it contains. Although absolute relativity often signals the absence of a moral and ethical core and is thus unreliable, the theory of relativism has more realistic features. Every day we face elections, the result of which often cannot be called correct or not. Most people, in principle, always try to act ethically, but even then, their actions can be perceived negatively. You will not please everyone precisely because, despite some existing ideas about good and evil, you make decisions that pass through the prism of experience, psychological characteristics of a person, circumstances, and weighing many factors. I find objectivism too utopian an ultimatum, which seeks to simplify morality while threatening it with a distorted view of reality.",
    "Cryptocurrencies are a controversial topic in society, as their volatility puts their long-term validity into question. However, older blockchain coins have failed to deliver a scalable and secure currency that will be as decentralized as possible (Hamilton, 2022). Unlike Bitcoin and Etherium, Solana has multiple advantages that make it a worthwhile investment. For this proposal, I would like to highlight the benefits of this cryptocurrency to a business university graduate. Solana is not the newest cryptocurrency, yet it is one with the highest potential. Other blockchains possess a small capacity for transactions, as their operations per second make them unfeasible (Locke, 2021). However, this currency transfers faster and has incomparably small transaction fees (Farrington, 2021). An investment in Solana is a safer choice among cryptocurrencies, yet it has the potential to multiply one’s savings. Safety and speed of transactions are the reasons behind the high chances for future widespread usage of Solana (Hamilton, 2022). My proposed idea is to capitalize on Solana’s recent success on the market, as this currency was up 12000% in the past year (Locke, 2021). I think that this subject deserves more attention, as cryptocurrencies provide a unique take on financial interactions, yet their current state disallows companies to utilize them efficiently. Solana has the potential to overcome these barriers and turn into a globally accepted currency. In conclusion, Solana is a cryptocurrency that is worth one’s attention, as it has several benefits that make it a better choice for investment than other similar coins. Its current solid position on the market and strong backing from a cryptocurrency community is a perfect indication of future prospects. It might be necessary to analyze Solana’s carbon footprint to prove its potential for a long-term success.",
    "Yoga is a concept that signifies a set of spiritual, mental, and physical practices aimed at managing the cognitive and physiological functions of the body. Practicing this sport allows one to broaden the horizons, change the habitual way of life, and eliminate harmful patterns that negate the efforts. That is why yoga is considered the most effective practice of self-development that has unique benefits for health, both physical and psychological. There are numerous varieties of modern yoga; despite the dissimilarities, they are grounded on shared parts: body postures, breathing exercises, and spiritual contemplation. The combination of exercises that train the body and soul has unique health benefits. It strengthens muscles, increases flexibility, and enhances mental soundness. Moreover, yoga classes have enormous therapeutic potential and preventive effects. Studies involving patients with various musculoskeletal conditions have indicated that yoga helps to reduce pain and improve joint mobility (Saeed et al., 2019). Breathing exercises relax the muscles that constrict the airways and strengthen oxygen diffusion, leading to better lung function. One of the chief yoga concepts is the “eight limbs,” which consists of alternating stages for achieving a state of enlightenment. Eight steps are a prerequisite for everyone to feel connected to the world. Through these practices, one learns to control one’s actions, accept all hardships calmly, and find compromises. The ultimate goal of the methodology is to learn to find a balance between one’s own and the world’s values and understand that each person has an essential mission in the community. It significantly affects an individual’s social well-being as it seeks to bring body, mind, and soul into unison (Saeed et al., 2019). The balance of these essential elements ensures a healthy and harmonious personality, activates energy potential, and prevents psychological stress. In conclusion, yoga is essential for promoting health and combating social isolation and depression. It can be used for physical development, healing, and emotional restoration. Yoga is based on a holistic approach that helps the whole body return to a normal state. It makes it an indispensable and beneficial self-development practice for the health of both adults and children.",
    "Theodor Adorno’s concept of industrial culture implied a strong connection between capitalist society and the products capitalism produces in the cultural sphere to enhance the existing social practices that benefit the further development of capitalism. Therefore, Adorno suggested that most media products, such as films, books, television programs, reinforce the population’s belief in capitalist values. On the other hand, the structural functionalism theory approaches society as a living organism, where each part of society plays its function in the viability maintenance of the whole organism. Therefore, even though the concepts have similarities in equally prioritizing the importance of stability in society, their differences can be more apparent through application to modern culture and society. In his theory, Adorno pointed at the obvious narrative of mass media products, such as films and books, where wealth is often associated with happiness. However, another example with a more apparent connection to reinforcing capitalism is entertainment for children. From a very young age, modern children are exposed to different sorts of media in the form of tv shows, cartoons, and animated films. In the structural functionalism approach, the entertainment industry for children presents a source of education and emotional development. In different forms, the children’s entertainment industry teaches them important moral practices of being kind and polite to other people, which serves as the foundation for security in the future society. However, in the industrial culture approach, modern children’s entertainment is focused on selling the merchandise of different characters featured in films. For example, one of the most influential companies, Disney, invented the business model of using cartoon characters to attract children to their theme parks (Clement, 2018). Now, the company strategically plans simultaneous launches of animated films and merchandise with the films’ characters to ensure financial benefit.",
    "Archetypes describe such characteristics, which are universal patterns that define certain events, objects, or people. In literature, they describe representations and concepts that are common to all people, which allow people to understand and interpret stories. However, archetypes also exist in everyday life and play a significant role in shaping the perception of the world around them. In particular, there are archetypes of people that help determine their character and actions, as well as motivation. Applying this concept to everyday life, one can single out special types of people who have a set of common and exclusive characteristics for them. They are formed both on the basis of the actions and inclinations of the person and depending on the environment. An example of an archetype in everyday life is the head of a large modern corporation, such as Elon Musk. He can be defined as a hero or creator who has the inspiration and courage to change the world around him. Other people perceive it in this way, which makes it a great example of an archetype. All his actions are motivated precisely by these characteristics, and his primary motivation is the transformation of the world. The presence of archetypes in everyday life allows me to compose a more comprehensive perception of people and events. In particular, based on the characteristics I know, I can determine the motivation and role of a certain person, which makes him more predictable. This is certainly more difficult than may be presented in the literature because people often have mixed features. However, in general, the concept of archetypes gives me the opportunity to understand the actions of people and their characters. I can later use this information to form my own relationship with them.",
    "Introduction The shifts in attitudes of people towards romantic relationships and, more specifically, marriage are attributes of societal development. From this perspective, the trends common for Gen Z are incredibly informative and, therefore, used for analyzing the situation in this area (Klein, 2022). It is clear that individuals’ mindsets are formed under the influence of external circumstances, which implies the correlation of opinions about love and sex with the presence of threats to personal well-being. Hence, one cannot examine the accompanying phenomena and cause-and-effect relationships while neglecting either the human factor or the conditions of the environment. One of the articles devoted to the subject is “Are Gen Z more pragmatic about love and sex?” and its critical analysis can reveal the elements of effective writing intended for considering complex events. Summary of the Article In the selected piece, Jessica Klein narrates the tendency for representatives of Gen Z to postpone marriage and avoid long-term relationships while prioritizing personal issues. Compared to previous generations, these individuals do not view this area as a natural condition for entering adulthood due to a number of reasons. First, the advantages of single life are more attractive than settling down and help them satisfy their need for introspection (Klein, 2022). Second, people in this group adopt a pragmatic approach to the matter because they understand the necessity of gaining stability in life in order to have a family (Klein, 2022). Third, Gen Zers face more problems than their parents due to the pandemic and prefer to reflect on the kind of person they want to be partners with and choose them carefully (Klein, 2022). As a result, the processes in this area slow down significantly, and the primary focus on self, as opposed to interactions with others, justify the changes which happened to this part of human life. Response Evidence The examined article is an effective piece of writing due to the inclusion of evidence from numerous sources, both of qualitative and quantitative nature. Thus, Klein (2022) refers to multiple studies related to the subject under consideration, including surveys conducted among the target population and statistical data gathered by official institutions. More importantly, she analyzes the current tendencies in the relationships of Gen Z through the lens of the experience of previous generations (Klein, 2022). This approach to the task makes the findings more credible compared to a possible orientation on the information received from the participants and, consequently, confirms the reliability of conclusions for conducting further research. The overall extensiveness of this publication is also supported by the inclusion of personal opinions alongside the studies mentioned above (Klein, 2022). In this way, the selection of appropriate instruments for the purposes of this article is one of its main advantages. External and Internal Factors",
    "From 2016 to 2018, this study summarizes sport fisheries in the Anchorage Management Area. They contained a description and historical background of each sport fishery, as well as information on how each fishery is now managed, as well as performance and escapement data for 2016–2018. According to the report, reductions in the number and size of fish available for release in locally stocked lakes have had a detrimental impact on local fisheries’ popularity and productivity. It should be mentioned that because this source gives statistical data, it may be trusted. All of this will surely be beneficial to the study, as official data must be considered. The sport fisheries in the North Gulf Coast Management Area are discussed in this study. A summary and overview of each fishery are included, and information on how the fisheries are managed and fishery performance and escapement from 2016 to 2018. This report is provided by the official department that controls fishing activities in Alaska. However, it should be noted that this source can be considered reliable as it provides statistical information. All this will undoubtedly be useful for research since it is necessary to take into account official data. The intricacy of variables that restrict or encourage diversity in Alaskan fisheries, one of the world’s most important fishing locations, is examined in this case study. They looked at changes in participation and portfolio variety in Alaskan fisheries over three decades using a mix of harvest statistics and literature reviews. The four case studies looked at how fishers, fleets, and communities responded to various interconnected stressors, such as biological decreases, market and pricing dynamics, and fisheries privatization. Experts also verified this article, which is reflected in the reliability and accuracy of the information provided. It will be useful for research because it reflects current trends and factors affecting the spread of sport fishing.",
    "Deductive reasoning involves the construction and development of cause-and-effect solid relationships. It is noteworthy that the connection is established either between two facts or a point and the idea of how it will affect the future (Besnard & Hunter, 2018). Thus, a judgment (logical expression) includes the first – the prerequisites, the second – the conclusion. In logic, an argument is valid only when it has a form that makes it impossible for the premises to be correct and the judgment to be wrong. According to the explained three types of deductive arguments, a valid statement does not need to have actually trustworthy premises. Still, it must have ones that, if they were accurate, would guarantee that the conclusion is proper. Example:  1. All metals are heavy  2. Tin is a metal  3. Tin is heavy A sound argument must have both a valid form and true premises. Valid arguments can be unsound, but they will have wrong assumptions. Example:  1. All dogs are cats  2. All mice are dogs  3. All mice are cats What makes this a valid statement is not that it has trustworthy premises and a proper conclusion but the logical necessity of the judgment, given the two assumptions. The argument would be just as valid if the premises and conclusion were wrong. However, it is essential to determine that the purpose of argumentation is to establish the truth of a judgment. An invalid argument does not achieve this goal, so it cannot be considered sound (Besnard & Hunter, 2018). A sound argument has a valid form and true premises; thus, it cannot be invalid in all cases. If the argument is invalid, then the beliefs thoroughly do not matter, and, in fact, only the conclusion remains. Therefore, this means that there is no argument in this case, especially a sound one.",
    "Aristotle made a discovery fundamental to all logic by introducing variables. Thus, it was shown that logic is not just a specific doctrine of specific things or terms, but the science of the laws of syllogisms, such as modus ponens or modus tollens, expressed in variables. Studying various judgments, formal logic abstracts from their specific content, revealing a structure common to objects of different content. Syllogism is the discovery of Aristotle and is the main and most original part of his logic. In the theory of syllogisms, Aristotle defined syllogism and distinguished its types, defined working and non-working types of syllogisms, and established three figures of syllogism. I find it particularly interesting that Aristotle was the first to make reasoning methods the subject of scientific research. He introduced the methods of reasoning as integral formations and not just certain reasoning components. Everything that was done in logic before Aristotle just attempted to understand individual methods and principles without any systematization and unification into a single coherent system. Thus, such concepts as Modus ponens and Modus tollens laid the foundation for understanding the definition of the truth of thinking. Thus, I am amazed at how accurately Aristotle introduced the concepts of conclusions that approach science by the rules of inference, the laws of contradiction, and the exclusion of the third. Modern logic as an independent field of knowledge arose from such different sciences as philosophy and mathematics. Being indeed a highly advanced concept, modern logic, however, lacks some characteristic philosophical features – it is more straightforward and technical. Modern logic is often called mathematical logic, thereby emphasizing the originality of its new methods compared to those used previously. In this sense, it is of less interest for discussion because it relies on exact sciences and computer technologists and avoids ambiguity. Thus, modern logic is built on artificial language and intelligence, which in itself is rather boring compared to traditional concepts.",
    "Using innovative technologies, ADNOC is planning to apply its electronic developments in all spheres of activity and production as early as next year. An equally noteworthy example of the diversity and multifunctionality of the use of artificial intelligence is the predictive ability of computer programs. The company is developing a computer capable of processing an impressive amount of large data and suggesting strategies for the company’s actions depending on the forecast. The developers of software for ADNOC strive to build a machine that would work according to a certain theory but would be able to offer the possibility of effective data reading. That is why, within the framework of the company, a powerful program was developed not only for material processing but also for its visualization. By using more accessible visual media to convey complex information, the development makes the future and present of the company more clearly visible and intelligible. The use of computer technologies in the development of a large company is noticeable at all levels of its existence. ADNOC uses computer simulations to improve the operation of the network chain and visualize data for a clearer picture of the company’s position. All these developments are implemented in each of the branches of the company’s operation, increasing the speed of performance and the effectiveness of actions that are more beneficial. Their project to computerize and update all sorts of areas of the company’s activities should be fully implemented in 2022 (ADNOC, 2020). This underlines the firm’s commitment to anticipating and adapting to the future. The company strives to develop a forecasting model that would include the largest possible amount of statistical data. The results of big data processing show that ADNOC has significantly accelerated the speed and the number of financial transactions through its software. Based on the logic of increasing the turnover of money, one can conclude that this software improves the financial performance of the company. In addition, it should be noted that as part of the accelerated exchange of money, an innovative blockchain technology is used, which provides a permanent digital transfer of currency. The program’s ability to make smart business decisions is already reflected in its $ 1 billion worth of stocks (Arabian Business, 2020). The varied opportunities for financial enrichment brought by this program are potentially enormous.",
    "The adversarial criminal justice system is one where the law is applied equally to all segments of the society. It is a system that presumes that one is innocent that shifts the burden of proof to the prosecution to prove beyond any shadow of a doubt. The advantage lies on the side of the defendant if there is any doubt. The accused is granted the right to silence and cannot be forced to respond to accusation levelled against them. This system poses some ethical problems because most of its procedural safeguards are always in favour of the accused. The favours that are granted to the accused include the right of appeal, the right to remain silent, the right to have an attorney, and the right to be free from unauthorized searches and arrests. The rights granted to the defendant are always a disadvantage to the prosecution which has to prove its case against the accused. This position is biased against the prosecution and makes its work even more difficult. The system encourages a scenario where both entities to a case contest with each other to win a case. This scenario makes it easier vulnerable to acts of deception and legal tactics that are questionable instead of using facts to settle cases. It is a potential ethical problem that can be solved by allowing both parties to present facts before any judgment is made to avoid injustices. If a black man is found committing a similar offence like a white woman, he is five times more likely to be arrested. It is a tendency that has been brought about by racism in the American judicial system and racial inequality in policing. Moreover, the black man is more likely to be convicted than a white woman who has committed a similar crime. According to a report by the United States Sentencing Commission, a black man who is found the same crime as the white man have a potential of receiving nearly 20% longer prison term (Ingraham, 2017). These disparities are due to cases of racism and bias found within the American criminal justice system.",
    "When learning about religions and philosophies, I find that origins or backgrounds are essential in interpreting the context and content of a religion. For Jainism, it was vital to learn that it is substantially older than a more well-known and contemporary Sikhism. Though both have close ties with Hinduism, Sihkism’s origins date back to only about 500 years ago while Jainism has a history of nearly 2500 years (Molloy 191). Sikhism exhibits a more militaristic approach to monotheism despite being more modern. As such, the Jainist belief that no Creator exists and that the universe is simply guided by natural forces becomes especially interesting as it rejects a very traditional integration of deities into theology. Following this, it is also interesting to me to observe in what ways a religion interacts with the world through its perspective. As mentioned above, Jainism rejects the belief in a Creator or God. This belief is held up by several philosophical questions that are even asked in atheistic circles. These include contradictions in typical monotheistic religions such as God being both perfect and creating an imperfect world or God loving all life but still allowing suffering. Jainism even poses a logical fallacy, which suggests that if everything in the universe had to be created, would God not also need to be created? This worldview is surprisingly modern and potentially controversial for its time. Ethics is another vital component of any philosophy or belief system. Jainism establishes five distinct principles of ethics which are Ahimsa (non-violence), Satya (truth), Astheya (non-stealing), Brahmacharya (chastity), and Aparigraha (non-possession). I am especially interested in Ahimsa which is the core of Jainist ethics. This is because I believe that many religions excuse violence due to their beliefs, which is inherently immoral to my values. Jainism proposes that non-violence is a priority and therefore inexcusable.",
    "It is important to note that it is highly common for one culture not to be able to understand the state, internal struggles, and intricacies of a different culture. The given notion is called ethnocentrism, where one’s perspective and views are centered around his or her own culture. For example, the book states: “people in America don’t understand, but when an American chain opens in a third-world country, people go crazy” (Noah 188). As a person living in Canada, I embody Canadian culture, where most people from developing nations might not fully understand that a mere fast food restaurant chain is not such a thrilling occurrence for regular consumers. The book also states that “Westerners are shocked and confused by that, but it’s a case of the West reaping what it has sown. The colonial powers carved Africa, put the black man to work, and did not properly educate him” (Noah 194). Similarly, many assume that Canadian people are excessively polite as part of the culture, but I would want others to know that it is not the case. One of the most interesting aspects of the book is how certain tyrants are not perceived as such in other places due to the lack of their relevance, which is why it is true for current leaders in Canada as well. The text states: “so in Europe and America, yes, Hitler is the Greatest Madman in History, In Africa, he’s just another strongman from history books” (Noah 196). Although Canada did not have such tyrants, many people outside Canada perceive that our leaders are perfect and representative of true democracy. However, it is not always true because they also face challenges for power struggles and do not always behave in the nation’s best interests, which are becoming more evident in recent events.",
    "Globalization is the extent to which information, investments, trade, political cooperation, cultural values, and social ideas flow among different countries. It is creating a borderless world for managers by allowing them to conduct their operations internationally rather than locally, hire employees from different countries, buy raw materials from the best sources, and sell goods in various markets (Samson et al., 2020). Although the borderless world presents many opportunities to managers, it also entails risks, such as information security and cultural differences. A global mindset is a manager’s ability to recognize and influence people or organizations that have different cultural, social, political, and psychological backgrounds (Samson et al., 2020). It has become imperative for international companies because managers constantly interact with individuals with different perspectives. To ensure effective operations and collaboration, managers should be able to understand these perspectives instead of sticking to a worldview prevalent in their home country. The international landscape is changing since China, India, and Brazil demonstrate economic growth and play an important role in global business. For example, China has received more foreign investments than any other place and has increased its number of Fortune Global 500 companies from 16 in 2005 to 98 in 2015 (Samson et al., 2020). While China is growing through manufacturing, India develops economically through services, software design, and precision engineering. A multinational corporation (MNC) is a company, with more than 25% of revenues which come from operations in countries other than the home country of the parent organization (Samson et al., 2020). MNCs are characterized by close cooperation among affiliates in different countries and a single management authority making key decisions for the parent company and all affiliates (Samson et al., 2020). Additionally, MNC managers have a global perspective, viewing the whole world as one market. Outsourcing refers to participating in a global division of labor that enables companies to complete certain activities in locations with the cheapest raw materials and labor (Samson et al., 2020). Exporting is an entry strategy in which the company’s production facilities remain in the home country, while produced goods are transferred to other countries for sale. Licensing is an entry strategy in which the company in one country gives firms in other countries access to specific resources, such as technology or trademark rights, to produce and sell its products abroad (Samson et al., 2020). Direct investing is an entry strategy where the company manages its production facilities in another country.",
    "This study’s independent variable was a helpful message on the back of the dining check regarding the upcoming specials. The dependent variable was the percentage of the bill left as a tip to the waiter. This study operationalizes the restaurant tipping culture by focusing on the tip percentage. The potential confounding variables of this experiment may be the food quality, the server’s gender, the dining party’s size, and whether the customers were regulars. The study’s strengths include design transparency, implementation simplicity, and potential replication in different settings. However, the message’s content varied depending on the special, appealing differently to customers. Furthermore, the study was conducted only in one restaurant, which renders extrapolation to different establishment classes difficult. These factors could impact the tipping outcomes and, therefore, the study results. Furthermore, it is unclear whether the mere presence of a personalized message or the message content itself drove the outcome. To evaluate this possibility, the authors could have asked waiters to write different messages, some with no useful content, such as wishing a good day or drawing a smiley face. Moreover, the researchers could have used alternative arrangements, assigning the waiters randomly instead of assigning dining parties randomly. Several aspects of this study could impact its internal validity. The researchers have instructed servers to keep their behavior consistent, thus limiting potential confounding variables. Varying attitudes may affect the final tip, thus undermining the causal relationship. Furthermore, a few hypothetical aspects could limit the research’s external validity. For instance, if the waiter were a young female adult, applying the same conclusions to male waiters and older servers would be challenging, given the potential gender factor. If the study was conducted at a private country club, extrapolating the result onto the high-class restaurant and casual diners alike would be unreliable. If the meal was buffet-style, the overall tipping percentage might have been lower due to the perceived lesser effort of a waiter, thus impacting its wider applicability. Lastly, the study only used two groups, servers, and dining parties, with no size specification. The authors could have employed a third group of solo dining parties, thus separating groups from those dining by themselves. Such an addition would allow addressing the question of the groups’ size effect and individual, interpersonal interactions. Lastly, implementing the design with solo dining parties would address the effect of gender on the outcome.",
    "As apparent from the title, the focus of the article “Positive leadership psychology: Authentic and servant leadership in higher education in Pakistan” is the Pakistani educational system, whose organization the authors analyze through the lens of leadership. Specifically, they examine the role of centralized guidance in the learning process and speculate on which style can influence its participants in the most favorable ways. In particular, the piece highlights the importance of relationships of trust in education. According to the authors, any suppressive hierarchy, strict subordination, or an atmosphere of complete obedience prevents people from openness, becoming a serious obstacle to social exchange. The latter is seen as the foundation of productive teamwork and presupposes an awareness of the other’s feelings as well as motives for searching for the most appropriate behavioral patterns. Therefore, within Bloom’s taxonomy, more precisely, its cognitive domain, the article describes the knowledge, the primary level. The publication is quite coherent and well-structured, which marks its appropriate quality. Notably, the outcomes of the analysis appear in an understandable form and actually serve to illustrate the theoretical background, in which part the authors comment on the essentiality of proper leadership in organizations. The practical part involves a detailed examination of several types and styles, specifically, the ways various leaders interact with employees. The general conclusion is the criticality of mutual respect and dedication to recognizing everybody’s needs, which underlies servant leadership as a practice. Human resources and psychology of leadership apparently are the areas where the investigators specialize. Notably, they participated in a range of publications on several topics within the above fields, such as organizational leadership, individual leadership, culture-specific peculiarities, and others. As mentioned, Current Psychology, the global peer-reviewed research forum, accepted their work for publishing, which means that it meets its quite specific quality requirements. It was found through the JFL, Jerry Falwell Library.",
    "Various cultures around the world have unique creation myths and traditional methods of presenting them through art. The cosmology of the Aztec civilization was quite different from the Europeans that conquered them. Firstly, the Europeans’ Christian God “created mankind in his own image” and granted him dominion over a perfectly constructed world, the Garden of Eden (Holy Bible, New International Version, Genesis 1:27). In the Bible, he is described as a benevolent, if strict, father figure who can forgive humankind their sins and grant them eternal redemption. Consequently, God is depicted in art as a wise, older man with a beard and white hair. Christian art primarily praises the power of His forgiveness and the bountiful nature that He created. In contrast, Aztec creation stories are based on dismembered gods, and thus the origin of the world is catastrophic violence, which explains why Aztec art depicts divinity as gruesome and awe-inspiring (National University, 2022). Their art functions as a warning and an order to obey. They demand blood in exchange for food, and each sculpture of the gods in Aztec culture contains a receptacle for human hearts (National University, 2022). Unlike Christianity, the central figure is a female goddess, but similarly to Eve, she is primarily a passive player whom the other gods punish. Furthermore, Coatlique’s choice to give birth a second time against her children’s wishes could also be interpreted as the Aztec version of Eve’s sin of disobedience. Both Aztec and Christian gods are described as perfect and self-contained. However, in the Aztec mythos, gods are above the concepts of good and evil, while in the Christian order evil is considered the dominion of Satan and the opposite of God. Therefore, Aztecs have to appease a bloodthirsty, violent goddess to receive food and survive. On the other hand, Christians have to reject sin and submit their spirit to God to gain eternal salvation. Ultimately, the Christian creation story is based on forgiveness and love compared to the Aztecs’ survival through violence, and this difference is reflected in their opposing art styles.",
    "The concept of nursing is closely associated with the idea of continuous improvement, as the trends of health care need to mirror the existing social trends to provide the best care possible. One way to secure such care is to refer to the latest scholarly findings to modify the approaches to care provision in the workplace. This process of implementing research-based findings in daily patient care is known as evidence-based practice (EBP) (Wilson & Austria, 2021). Currently, EBP is not used actively by nurses for several reasons. First, the workload of most nurses discourages their desire to learn and embrace EBP. According to McArthur et al. (2021), a physical opportunity is a construct that contributes to the nurses’ ability to resort to EBM. Physical opportunity includes such barriers as “cost and lack of resources, compromised communication, staff turnover, and limited physical guidelines” (McArthur et al., 2021, p. 20). As a result, management promotes behavioral patterns that react to the environment rather than examine it in advance. The second massive barrier to EBP in the workplace is the lack of social opportunity embodied in the lack of organizational support and teamwork (McArthur et al., 2021). Since the aforementioned examples tackle only a minor part of the existing challenged, the need to intervene and facilitate EBP is evident. The first commonly mentioned approach to facilitate the use of EBP is to establish a leadership that would encourage the practice by both setting an example and conducting training and workshops. Another crucial facilitator is to secure nurses’ access to relevant sources in the workplace, including relevant databases, steady Internet connection, and subscription to peer-reviewed publications. In such a way, the use of scholarly research will become more time-efficient and less stressful for nurses.",
    "It goes without saying that Beowulf may be regarded as one of the most prominent ancient European poems. Although its origin remains the subject of multiple discussions, the common version describes it as “a Danish poem in the Anglo-Saxon dialect” (Neidorf 847). The poem describes the glorious life and deeds of a hero, Beowulf, who was regarded as a person sent by heaven for people (Gummere line 13). Helping Hrothgar, king of the Danes, he kills the monster Grendel and his mother. Later, when he becomes the king of Danes by himself, he has to fight a dragon that terrorizes his lands. Although he follows the beast and finally slays it, Beowulf dies, being mortally wounded. From a personal perspective, this poem reflects several essential aspects of human life. The first one is the issue of identity – in Beowulf , people were entirely associated with the glory of their ancestors. They do not exist independently from their family lineage and kinship bonds. Thus, their desire of Beowulf to be recognizable and honored forces him to search for deeds and fame. Thus, another important theme of the poem is the maturity and responsibility that come with age. At the beginning of the poem, the main hero desires personal glory and has nothing to lose. However, after becoming a king, he realizes the importance of being a wise ruler who is responsible for his people’s lives. Finally, one more topic of the poem is the tension between personal value systems and the heroic code and between Christian and pagan values. It may be regarded as an example of the multifacetedness and complexity of human nature in comparison with fixed rules that frequently do not provide appropriate answers.",
    "Beowulf is an Anglo-Saxon epic poem set in Jutland before the Angles migrated to Britain. The title of this literary work is the name of the main character (Hall 2). Beowulf became one of the revered heroes in Old English literature, and the poem itself had a strong influence on pop culture. This epic character, who accepts his fate without hesitation, attracts attention in modern times full of doubts and contradictions with his almost archetypal clarity and wholeness. Indeed, for example, it can be assumed that modern superhero comics are particularly popular, partly because people still need the image of a fair, superpowered being. One of the most popular heroes of the Marvel Universe is Superman. Their similarities with Beowulf are obvious – both have incredible strength and are role models for the people of their time (Burn 107). These heroes have to overcome obstacles to help those who need support. In both universes, strength and extreme physical abilities become objects of praise and reverence. In addition, a key factor contributing to the plot of the heroes’ destinies is the presence of an enemy, on whose destruction depends the survival of the world. However, the fundamental difference is that a hero’s physical strength is not enough to admire him for modern people. This characteristic must be complemented by the purity of thought and good intentions. The hero becomes much more complex as the modern world gets more sophisticated. The fact that people still draw inspiration from old stories correlates with the tenets of postmodernist theory. According to the latter, it is necessary to constantly reproduce what has passed, make sense of it, and experiment with its content. It can be seen that stories about legendary superheroes remain relevant to contemporary viewers, readers, and audiences in general. As in Saxon times, bravery and loyalty are revered, and having these characteristics is what makes an individual a role model.",
    "There are multiple factors that stand behind the successful implementation of the P-O-L-C framework. It is important to prioritize some of them duly in case a company faces serious issues, or when the market indicates upcoming challenges. The collapse of WorldCom in 2002, that led to one of the largest accounting scandals in the US, provides a nice example of the lack of proper communication in a corporation. The inability of various top managers and accountants to communicate efficiently in order to prevent frauds is always disastrous. WorldCom grew rapidly under Bernard Ebbers who managed to jump at the multiple opportunities that the growing interest for telecom services provided at that time. Nevertheless, the company went bankrupt in a matter of a few years. Moreover, Ebbers faced several charges, including one count of conspiracy, one count of securities fraud and seven counts of filing false statements with securities regulators. The fact that the large portion of Ebber’s wealth was in WorldCom stocks, let alone several loans and loan guarantees from the company, was also scrutinized. The top managers of the company faced numerous charges and started to testify against each other. Moreover, Ebbers and his subordinates alike claimed to know nothing of the fraudulent schemes. According to Knecht (2020), up to 80% of employees generally believe that their opinions are not taken into account. Therefore, the major factor that led to the collapse of the telecom giant was the diminished quality of communication within the company. The reasons for all the misunderstanding and complicated series of negotiations between Ebbers, directors and accountants are rooted in barriers to communication that include motive distortion and extreme self-absorption. The top managers and professionals who were expected to lead the company tended to prioritize their own interests and receive only the parts of information and data that was convenient to them. Thus, the atmosphere created by such an attitude eventually led to the collapse of the corporation, as a result of the lack of decently organized teamwork.",
    "The Bhagavad Gita is an ancient Indian scripture that consists of 700 verses and is part of the larger epic Mahabharata. This book is one of the central holy scriptures of Hinduism and dates from the second half of the first millennium BC. e. The plot of the Gita unfolds within the framework of a conversation between Arjuna, the prince of the Pandavas, and Krishna, his guide, charioteer, and the supreme God incarnate. Krishna prompts Arjuna’s behavior patterns and helps to solve some moral expectations. The latter is connected with the need for the Pandavas to fight against the Kauravas. This paper aims to reflect on the Bhagavad Gita , one of the most outstanding books of the Indian epic. Arjuna exhibits characteristic traits, such as self-confidence, arrogance, pride. Arjuna demonstrates outstanding martial skills and is one of the best warriors. Krishna is the personification of the Supreme God and his traits include wisdom, humility, knowledge, and benevolence. The two characters have a close relationship: “Then, Madhava (Krishna) and the son of Pandu (Arjuna), stationed in their magnificent chariot with white horses yoked to it, loudly blew their divine conchs” (“Bhagavad Gita,” 2021, p. 13). Other characters are the Kaurava king Dhritarashtra and his adviser Sanjaya, secondary characters. The purpose of the author of the epic was to tell about the battle of Kurukshetra, where two Indian armies gathered to fight until the final victory. Arjuna asks Krishna to drive up to the center of the battlefield and finds those who will participate and those who want war – his relatives, friends, and teachers. Arjuna feels betrayed as he doesn’t want to fight and kill them. Full of doubt, he drops his bow and asks his charioteer Krishna many questions about the reasons for the war, the possibility of renouncing the battle, the correctness of his action, and ethical dilemmas. Thus, the reflection on the Bhagavad Gita, one of the most outstanding books of the Indian epic, was provided. The book is relevant, as it reveals eternal themes – morality, justice, a sense of duty, a feeling of love for one’s neighbor. The philosophical dialogue between Arjuna and Krishna touches on the most challenging ethical topics that apply to both war and peace. The characters discuss identity crisis, the purpose of life, the human self, and human temperament.",
    "The TED Talks are illustrations of bio-psycho-social-spiritual developmental issues which ultimately create circumstances in which certain people do not feel fully included in society. For example, Smith (2015) refers to the differences correlating with raising a white and a black child. Abdel-Magied (2014), on the other hand, exemplifies how a piece of clothing changes the way people treat, view, and evaluate Muslim women. It is certain that discrimination starts with bias, which is a layered concept. An article published by New York Times (2016) refers to the experiences of non-white people in the US, which often correlate with the lack of feeling of inclusion. This is also perpetrated by bias, which creates specific overviews in which people tend to favor a group of people over another one. The bias may be automatic, ambiguous, and ambivalent depending on its characteristics and how it manifests in terms of people’s opinions on certain groups of individuals (Fiske, 2022). While such incidents have never been personally experienced, it is certain that the lives of people I know have been affected in terms of self-esteem and confidence, which can often be negatively impacted because of discrimination. I would like to explore racial bias due to its relevance in today’s day and age, namely how it manifests on structural levels.",
    "The film “Coded Bias” provides comprehensive information regarding the problems related to facial recognition algorithms, determining several sources of bias. They primarily include the original orientation of creators on white faces, leading to the lack of data regarding dark complexion and the prevalence of prejudiced male developers. These conditions do not allow establishing equality in terms of race and gender and seem to present a significant threat to the field stemming from the failure to meet everyone’s needs. In addition, the lack of knowledge of how the programs process data and make conclusions does not help eliminate the risks. In turn, the possible ways of reducing this type of bias attributed to present-day facial recognition algorithms are to prevent their implementation in legal proceedings and police activity in general and introduce practical improvements. The former means accepting responsibility for decisions, and the latter suggestion is multi-faceted and should begin with updating databases to increase their variety and conducting independent assessments to confirm efficiency. By adopting these measures, bias based on race and gender can be addressed over time, and the appropriate quality of operations can be guaranteed. The mentioned ideas seem crucial for promoting proper use of technology; however, they can not only increase the precision of programs but also resolve the challenge concerning surveillance and racialized minorities. This standpoint is based on the above consideration, according to which accountability for decisions should be clearly established. This change can be performed if the algorithms work correctly, and minimizing or eliminating bias, in this case, is possible if internal and external evaluations correlate with each other. In this way, the future of this field in terms of its suitability for investigations is conditional upon the efforts of specialists in resolving the existing issues to address major concerns of Nakamura and Browne.",
    "The Caribbean history includes the ruthless colonization by Western countries like Spain. Upon colonization, the area was home to native groups such as the Ciboney or Guanahuatebey, Taino Arawak, and Carib. The colonizers brought a bunch of enslaved Africans who would work in their homes and plantations. The Whites were the minority and foreigners in the Caribbean but brutally seized and ruled against the Blacks majority. However, the Blacks maintained their identity and self-expression through various cultural activities evident to date. The Caribbean is the home for many musical genres expressing human freedom and revolution. Reggae is associated with the Caribbean people, and it is the unofficial soundtrack of many Caribbean vacations. Reggae musicians such as Bob Marley and the Wailers produced revolutionary and redemptions songs protesting against the White brutal rule in the Caribbean. Therefore, through Reggae, the Caribbean people expressed their anger against the ruthless White control. The majority African population in the Caribbean identified themselves with their cuisines and customs, including religious beliefs. The enslaved people maintained their African culinary art and cherished their cuisines. For instance, the Callaloo, the Caribbean vegetable soup, is one of the national dishes in Tobago and Trinidad. Furthermore, carnivores and parades are serious business in the area. The Caribbean parades manifest the area’s folklores and customs of African origin. The Caribbean people commemorate events in history like slavery through carnivals. The distinct African heritage in the Caribbean helped in identifying the Blacks. The Caribbean was colonized by the whites, who were the minority of the area’s population. The colonizers brought Africans who worked in their homes and plantations under the fierce rule. However, the enslaved people and the Blacks in the area expressed and identified themselves through music and distinct African heritage. Reggae songs helped the Blacks protest against the pitiless white rule, and events such as the parades and carnivals commemorated slavery. Furthermore, African cuisines such as Callaloo identified Africanism in the Caribbean. Despite the brutal rule by the White minority, the Blacks in the Caribbean expressed and identified themselves through songs and events that are evident to date.",
    "Society has always been a fundamental institution influencing the development of states. Communicating in groups, people share values, views, and responses to a particular phenomenon. Interaction in communities or clubs cultivates a public attitude to multiple events, forms a lifestyle, and influences politics. For this reason, the changes in civic life are significant for states. Putnam, in his essay “Bowling Alone,” also emphasizes this idea, saying that the social life of the USA collapses, and it is difficult to predict the results of this process. Active engagement in social processes has always been one of the major features peculiar to the country, but the situation has changed. Putnam says that “tens of millions of Americans had forsaken their parents’ habitual readiness to engage in the simplest act of citizenship” (67). It means that people have started to alter their lifestyles, shifting towards isolation and detachment, which is not typical for U.S. society. Furthermore, traditional organizations, such as clubs, are replaced by new mass membership organizations. Putnam says they have more political importance and might impact the country; however, they do not promote civic engagement. “For the vast majority of their members, the only act of membership consists in writing a check for dues or perhaps occasionally reading a newsletter” (Putnam 70). This line shows that Putnam is worried about the continuous process of disconnecting community members, who become divided and disengaged. From a long-term perspective, it might result in the collapse of civic life. The results cannot be predicted as the USA has always been a state with strong community relations. That is why Putnam says that if nothing changes, we will bowl alone, isolated from others.",
    "One of the most critical factors of breast cancer development is heredity since it causes a genetically inherent disease. If the patient’s closest relatives have been diagnosed with breast cancer, a tumor’s likelihood is high even at a young age (Coleman & Tsongalis, 2016). Since one of the patient’s close relatives had this disease, this diagnosis is indeed possible for her as well. Another significant factor in developing cancer is various diseases of the mammary glands, for example, “cystic” breasts. In the presence of such conditions, the formation of atypical cells is possible in the mammary gland (Tkaczuk et al., 2016). This can lead to their overgrowth and increase the risk of more severe diseases. The hormonal factor also has a critical influence on health. In the described case, this aspect is the most significant since it includes various details of the patient’s life. These include the first pregnancy after 30 years, not breastfeeding, and many years of taking hormonal contraceptives. This leads to the fact that the patient’s hormonal background can be disrupted (Tkaczuk et al., 2016). Therefore, with age, it becomes more difficult for the body to deal with abnormal processes. If there is an initial stage of cancer, there can be no metastasis in the patient’s organs. However, early active metastasis is characteristic of aggressive forms of cancer. There are multiple ways to determine them, and it is necessary to use some of them in any case to avoid future health problems. Histological analysis of tissue can determine the aggressiveness of the cancer type at an early stage. Breast cancer metastases detected by CT or scintigraphy indicate secondary foci in the lungs, liver, bones, and brain. It must be remembered that in breast cancer, metastases are capable of long-term existence in a latent state, even five to ten years after removal of the primary tumor.",
    "International labor laws prohibit making employment decisions regarding individuals’ age and disabilities. It means that Etihad Airways infringed on the existing regulations by introducing its approach to layoff. Considering the fact that social justice is a central demand for multinational corporations, Etihad’s conduct can be viewed as unethical and irrelevant. The more significant employee involvement in the decision-making process could have helped to avoid this situation. It directly influences performance and guarantees that fair decisions considering the workers’ input are made. Thus, Etihad attained success in compensating employees for their contribution and work. Payment processing is a critical factor influencing job security and employees’ motivation, meaning that this decision helps Etihad to generate benefits and rehire them in the future. From the case, one can also see that reduction in job security was a critical factor associated with the change process in Etihad. The decision to fire workers resulted in a lack of confidence among specialists and reduced their motivation and long-term plans in the corporation. For this reason, it is critical to secure employee positions to ensure individuals are engaged and fulfill their duties effectively. Discrimination was another factor peculiar to the change process at Etihad Airways. The corporation disregarded the corporate social responsibility issues, which resulted in the growth of dissatisfaction, lack of motivation, and engagement. It means that the company ignored possible alternatives that could have been used instead of its discriminative practices undermining job security and individuals’ readiness to work with such entities. Altogether, the case shows that lack of employee involvement was one of the fundamental issues in the case. The company’s top management made changes with minimal employee involvement. It resulted in creating an unpopular and ineffective strategy that cultivated dissatisfaction among workers. Etihad Airways ignored employees’ need for self-actualization, decreasing their motivation. The remaining workers did not feel their importance to the corporation and the power to influence its development. It demonstrates that modern workers should be provided with the chance to participate in corporate decision-making to realize their significance and become motivated. Trying to manage the wage bill, Etihad Airways accepted the wrong decision, viewing layoff as the only possible option. The choice of disability and age as criteria for decision-making infringed on the existing labor laws. Moreover, it undermined job security as employees realized their vulnerable position. Outcomes prove the low effectiveness of this strategy. Regarding the absence of available manpower, the remaining employees started to suffer from burnout because of the high level of stress. Moreover, the lack of motivation and engagement because of the processes mentioned above influenced their performance. As a result, Etihad Airways’ ability to achieve existing objectives was hindered. The case proves the critical importance of employee involvement in decision-making during the change process as it helps to motivate them and select the most acceptable options.",
    "Every business must be managed carefully, and every detail must receive a fair amount of attention. When it comes to healthcare, such facilities must require even more attention because they focus on people’s well-being. Performing such duties might be strenuous and expensive, and mentally demanding. As a Chief Nursing Officer, one will be faced with principles that include integrity maintenance, cash flow management, and employee motivation in the given circumstances. To start with, a healthcare business must always maintain its integrity. It can be evident that any business field should be focused on communication, which makes integrity a vital part (Fisher, 2008). In the given facility, the integrity maintenance principle is heavily adhered to. First of all, every doctor follows an ethical code, meaning that they know of doctor-patient confidentiality. Moreover, doctors and nurses focus on honest communication with patients. For example, in my situation, I tell patients about their actual conditions and honestly answer their questions. Another important business principle is proper cash flow management. Healthcare facility requires renovations and innovations, meaning that there will constantly be situations when new equipment or repairs will be needed (Mason et al., 2020). In this situation, it is highly necessary to implement the needed changes to not jeopardize patients’ health and well-being. For example, as a CNO, it was my obligation to manage the replacement of power generators. As a result, generators enabled the personnel to carry out their duty without problems during a storm and power outage. The last principle is the management of employees and providing them with motivation. In the case of a healthcare facility, it is essential that the employees are rewarded and their hard work is appreciated. The employees are offered extra days off and gift cards in the given facility. This can make the workers feel heard and supported. Without these steps, the nurses and doctors will have burnout and lose the desire to provide high-quality results. Thus, the given principles were chosen due to the impact they can bring on employees and patients. The mentioned principles are being used, providing good results and leading to the satisfaction of all parties. These principles are important to me since I believe that healthcare should be based on these values. Otherwise, no facility will be able to treat their patients, and there will be no trust and respect between healthcare personnel and patients.",
    "The nature of mythology and its persistence in culture throughout thousands of years has long fascinated scholars and thinkers. Joseph Campbell’s book entitled The hero with a thousand faces investigates this issue in detail to reveal how myth as a psychologically informed phenomenon predetermines cultural patterns of humanity. In this paper, the first chapter of the book, “Myth and dream,” will be at the center of the discussion. The thesis of this part might be projected through the following quote. The author states that myths “are dangerous because they threaten the fabric of the security into which we have built ourselves and our family. But they are fiendishly fascinating too, for they carry keys that open the whole realm of the desired and feared adventure of the discovery of the self” (Campbell, 2004, p. 7). Such a formulation implies that people’s minds intertwine myths and dreams as a mechanism of self-perception, understanding of the self in the context of the whole life cycle, and coping with developmental change. Myths lead people through the challenges of life and allow for integrating the conscious and subconscious into a single framework. Indeed, prior to presenting the idea in the above-mentioned quote, Campbell (2004) refers to the repetitive occurrence of the terrors and irrationalities from ancient mythology in contemporary people’s dreams. Indeed, the motifs of hatred, vanity, jealousy are intertwined with love, gratitude, and other feelings and motivations to action. In such a manner, these matters are dangerous to people because they unveil the psychological underpinnings of their subconscious in ways that contradict their rational or conscious decision-making and thinking. The author elaborates on this central idea by referring to the letters written by people about their myth-like dreams reflecting their concerns or subconscious struggles. Campbell (2004) presents an example of a young man’s dream about accidentally killing his father to obtain the full attention of his mother, which has been a recurring theme in mythology. Furthermore, the author refers to a dream of a woman who sees a half-horse-half-man individual in her dream despite any ideas of infidelity experienced consciously. In this regard, the connection between the experiences of early childhood and adulthood is essential for myths and their manifestation in dreams. This observation helps explain the second part of the quote, which states that through the contradictions of the myth-like dreams, people can understand their selves and the subconscious triggers of their emotions and behaviors.",
    "Recent fad diets have suggested that carbohydrates cause harm to one’s body. However, this statement has been refuted many times for several reasons. Firstly, to get a beautiful, efficiently functioning body, one needs nutrients – fats, proteins, carbohydrates, and water (Nazario). Carbohydrate metabolism converts carbs into vital energy for the nervous system and brain, as well as for the possibility of proper metabolism of proteins and fats. Once these elements are eliminated, there is a high risk of developing continuous fatigue, which potentially leads to depressive mood. Secondly, giving up carbohydrates leads to extra pounds because after completing a carb-free diet, the body is susceptible to every gram of carbohydrates, and super-compensation occurs in the diet. In addition to an increased appetite for carbohydrate-containing foods, the assimilation of this element increases significantly (Nazario). For example, a person was on such a diet for a month and lost ten pounds, and then immediately returned to a regular diet, regaining the same weight within a week. Thirdly, even after the first day of giving up carbohydrates, a person may feel a slight malaise and headache (Nazario). Later, there is a chance of developing constant headaches leading to migraine. Ultimately, carbohydrates are the primary source of energy for the brain. All cognitive functions slowly fade away when the main “engine” ceases to receive sufficient charge. Almost every activity demands increased brain activity which is stimulated by carbs (Nazario). When a person does not consume them, primarily the level of concentration reduces. Constant burning of ketones instead of glucose can lead to impaired brain function. Therefore, it is vital to include carbs into one’s ration in order to ensure that all bodily systems function properly.",
    "Cost of Advanced Documentation System The Advanced Documentation System is a document technology partner that helps optimize and ameliorate the work of the company’s printers. The costs spent on printers and their supply grow exponentially within years. There are various ways to improve the way printers are handled by implementing helpful services such as the Advanced Documentation System. The cost of the system depends on the brand, for instance on Capterra, the service costs $25 per month with a minimum of 5 working places which is $125 in total (Capterra, 2022). The software has a free trial period that allows the customer to understand the features of the system and its working specialties. The usage of the system can become profitable for the company within time. It is a cost-saving service as it analyzes and teaches the personnel to use various printer regimes for various needs. The software teaches the customer to use the printer on a higher level and consequently leads to better document management including converting papers to digital and re-engineering procedures for better productivity. The service successfully integrates into the IT environment of the firm and optimizes the inner work processes. Eventually, the implementation of the Advanced Documentation System can become an investment within time as it can save the time of the personnel, increase their productivity, and help the environment (Advanced Document Systems, 2022). The environmental-friendly approach is based on saving the print and the time printers are used by the personnel. Alternative Funding Sources The company can pay for the service using various financial resources for alternative funding resources. The sources usually depend on the scale of the firm, its level of income, and its current position in the market. The easiest and most accessible way to pay for Advanced Document System is from the cash flow, especially if the company has a surplus of profit. Some companies do not possess many employees and income, and they can take a bank loan to cover the costs of the system. The bank loan can also be helpful when the service is needed for many seats that have to be united and optimized. Then, the costs spent on the system increase, and extra funding might be needed. To increase the cash flow, the company can also go to the equity market and issue the stocks. The more stocks are sold to shareholders, the more cash flow the firm receives and can use for different needs. The other way to find alternative funding sources is to issue bonds that represent a fixed-income instrument. A bond is a debt obligation meaning that the company loans from an investor a specific sum of money. Bonds are safe for investors and faster to get for the company because more people invest in bonds as a safer method. Finally, the company can use mixed funding to get the cash for the payment which means uniting several methods described above. All the funding opportunities are possible for buying and implementing the Advanced Documentation System.",
    "Rolling Stones were in the shadow of the Beatles from the very beginning, and this fact disturbed them a lot. On the other hand, most of the fame went to the Beatles, and the Rolling Stones constantly felt their superiority. To be different, they tried to become the anti-Beatles. The legendary Beatles were a pioneer of hard rock: the musical influence of the song Helter Skelter led to the emergence of heavy metal (Covach and Bell 28). The influence of The Rolling Stones on the formation and development of rock music cannot be overestimated. It was significant not only in music, like the Beatles but also in artistic and visual, image and mass media terms. In songwriting development, the Rolling Stones tried hard to keep up with their competitors, but it was not easy, and they seemed to be one step behind. A lot of what they did was a reaction to what the Beatles had already done. For example, when a sitar began to sound in the Beatles’ composition, it immediately appeared in the Rolling Stones. The Beatles, with their working-class origins in provincial Liverpool, sought to maintain an elegant image (Covach and Bell 28). They dressed in decent suits, cut their hair neatly and short, and communicated politely with everyone. The Rolling Stones did the opposite: they wore black leather clothes and looked and behaved provocatively. In 1964, when The Beatles first came to the US, it was called the British invasion (Covach and Bell 28). The Beatles took all five first places in the Billboard singles chart at once and became the only ones who were able to set such a record (Covach and Bell 28). The Rolling Stones also achieved success in the US, mainly through shocking exposure, but they did not shake the Beatles’ position. Many of the rock bands of the 60s, The Beatles and The Rolling Stones, are seen as irreconcilable rivals. The reasons to think so are quite weighty: they played different music and had different images. However, both groups have influenced music around the world and have become one of the most recognizable – this is their main similarity.",
    "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic and long-term disorder characterized by uncontrollable, repeated thoughts and behaviors that an individual feels the need to repeat over and over. The case of Robert, a twenty-three-year-old young man, will be discussed further. Robert came to a mental health facility to get treated for anxiety, but it soon turned out that he rather struggled with OCD because he strongly smelled of disinfectant and reported excessive cleaning behaviors. After being in contact with surfaces and people, Robert felt a strong urge to wash his hands with bleach. He could wash his hands up to thirty times a day, which damaged his skin dramatically. However, the fear of germs was much stronger, and he could not stand touching something without washing his hands afterward. The issue of cleanliness took a great toll on his mental health. During the pandemic, the symptoms of OCD increased significantly. Robert reported wearing a HAZMAT suit outside, afraid of contracting the virus. In his social life, Robert avoids making physical contact with people and prefers keeping his distance from them. He works remotely from home, which quite pleases him because he does not have to go anywhere and spend time with other people in a confined space. Overall, Robert does not have a dependency on other people when it comes to handling his OCD and prefers being on his own the majority of the time. In Robert’s case, the combination of behavior therapy and pharmacological treatment is possible. Cognitive-behavioral treatment can be implemented for treating Robert’s OCD, including exposure and response prevention and cognitive restructuring (Moody, 2017). It is expected that Robert will feel relief from his symptoms within several weeks.",
    "Physical examination of the affected regions of the skin is necessary. Individuals with cellulitis are likely to have a reddened region of the skin, swelling as well as intense pain (Brown & Watson, 2022). Brant experiences pain in his right leg, in a reddened region that is swollen. The affected area should be thoroughly checked for any signs of skin disintegration. Variations in temperature in the area should be monitored along with signs of an abscess (Sutherland & Parent, 2017). Brant revealed that he was bit by a mosquito on the reddened area. This being a seemingly severe case, the physician may order complete blood count (CBC) testing. This will help measure blood count levels (Bennett et al., 2020). A CBC will allow the physician to make an accurate early diagnosis of a wide range of medical conditions. The physician may also order a C-reactive protein (CRP) test, which is a blood test for inflammation. This would be a necessity since Brant has broken skin because of a mosquito bite (Sutherland & Parent, 2017). Brant’s case is an event of major systemic disturbance since there is a manifestation of chills and acute disorientation. Priority diagnostic criteria for Brant would include assessing the occurrence of erythematous inflammation in the basal dermis and subcutaneous tissue. Redness, swelling, and pain are all signs of cellulitis (Sutherland & Parent, 2017). Erythema must be present in order to make the diagnosis. The location and nature of broken skin should also be assessed. For cellulitis to be diagnosed, the patient’s skin must be checked for micro-abrasions resulting from insect bites (Brown & Watson, 2022). Lower limbs are commonly affected. Brant’s positioning and movement should be adjusted. To reduce swelling in the areas facing downward, Brant’s feet and arms should be propped up on cushions while he lays on his back (Zariquiey-Esteva & Santa-Candela, 2017). If Brant stands for a long time, speedy blood flow to the heart may be hindered, which could cause low blood pressure. Brant may also need to be placed on his side in the recovery position, particularly whenever he feels nauseated or feels like vomiting. From the assessment, he feels nauseated and weak and has vomited on numerous occasions (Zariquiey-Esteva & Santa-Candela, 2017). This will help avoid low blood pressure. When germs break through the skin, “cytokines” and “neutrophils” are released into the bloodstream to fight them off. This causes cellulitis, which is characterized by redness, warmth, swelling, and pain (Brown & Watson, 2022, para 5). This appears to have been the case for Brant. He was bitten by a mosquito, which broke his skin, allowing bacteria (Streptococcus pyogenes) to penetrate the area. An outbreak of redness and swelling occurred when “cytokines and neutrophils” were drawn to the area of the skin to fight against the bacteria (Brown & Watson, 2022, para 5).",
    "One of the distinct characteristics of the nursing craft is the professionals’ need to constantly adapt to the dynamic environment of health care service and approaches to patient care. In order to facilitate this process, researchers have identified a series of change theories that seek to systematize the experience of implementing new practices (Udod & Wagner, 2018). The two most widespread theories of change in the nursing practice are Lewin’s change theory and Roger’s five-step theory. In Lewin’s framework, the change process undergoes three major stages: unfreezing, change proper, and refreezing (Udod & Wagner, 2018). Thus, according to this framework, in order to introduce change, the team needs to acknowledge the existing workflow and “unfreeze” this system, actively participate in implementing change and new functional patterns, and, finally, make the change a new generally accepted standard. Unlike Lewin’s approach, Roger’s model is more oriented towards the staff’s response and acceptance of the change through the gradual shifting process. Indeed, this five-step model implies exhaustive preliminary research, gathering staff’s feedback, conducting a pilot study, and actually implementing the change proposal (Udod & Wagner, 2018). Hence, it may be concluded that while Lewin’s model addresses mostly the implementation of the evidence-proven modifications, the five-step model is designed to prove the suggested change beneficial to the clinical environment. When speaking of the change proposal for the capstone project, Roger’s approach to change implementation is more appropriate. Considering the fact that the project seeks to justify the hypothesis of the EBP training’s positive impact on nurses’ self-esteem and patient satisfaction, the data collected from the intervention will be crucial for further implementation of this change to nursing practice. This theory has also been proven advantageous by the preceptor, as she has successfully integrated changes into the staff’s scheduling patterns using Roger’s model.",
    "It is necessary to fully understand the fundamental difference between the concepts of a leader and a regular employee in any field. While the head of the company is most often focused on the internal financial processes, a good leader understands the paramount importance of employees in any enterprise. The ideal leader sees the potential in every person and helps them develop to the maximum while working with them in the same direction instead of putting pressure. The policy of actions of flawed leaders can lead to more than unpleasant consequences for all sides of any business. Unfortunately, imperfect leaders in our time can be found a lot in any field. Bad experiences can happen on any level, from personal to global. It is particularly difficult to single out a specific person without personal experience and hard evidence, but statistics show an extremely high proportion of unscrupulous people in high positions. According to available data, the owner of Ali Express online retailer, Jack Ma, can be cited as an example. Plenty of evidence suggests that most of the items available to order are made by underage children from the poorest parts of the world. With the tacit consent of Jack Ma, many thousands of people are being exploited for minimal pay and terrible living conditions. It is an example of a person who is not only a bad leader but intentionally contributes to the violation of human rights. One of the biggest problems, in this case, is the lack of empathy and humanism. A bad leader always looks at people through the prism of a solid resource and cheap labor. It is difficult for an imperfect leader to hear and understand a person’s intentions through the prism of ignorance and selfishness. It is the absolute wrong approach, leading to nothing but a dead end. However, it should be noted that any statement in this vein is a serious accusation and requires additional thorough collection and analysis of data. The exploitation of people in any level of relationship, from business to politics, cannot lead to a successful and fulfilled conclusion. The best people and professionals will not tolerate such an attitude and quickly find a replacement with better conditions. The main mistake of many leaders in any business is an overly egocentric picture of the world and a tendency to immoral exploitation of people’s resources.",
    "Developing a contract so that all parties involved could be aware of their obligations and meet them accordingly is one of the vital tasks for an organization. Charles Schwab, an organization offering banking and brokerage services, has developed a contract for its users to sign so that both parties could meet the respective requirements (Reder et al., 2021). For their collaboration. Since the contract in question contains the essential components of a legal agreement, it can be considered viable. Starting with the key definitions of the foundational concepts on which the agreement is based, Schwab’s contract establishes the offer, acceptance, and legality terms from the start exceptionally clearly. The specified clarity and transparency benefit the company and its customers, promoting immediate trust and cooperation (Templin, 2017). Remarkably, Schwab also provides a robust basis for the consideration element of the agreement. Namely, the contract outlines the legal issues associated with the disbursement process, as well as the associated trading concerns (“Schwab account agreement,” 2022). Outlining that Schwab is not responsible for tracking the trading process, the contract sets the key responsibilities and relations between the parties completely clearly. Incorporating the primary components of a legal contract, the brokerage agreement created by Schwab offers its customers a chance to familiarize themselves closely with the services that they will obtain and the responsibilities that they have. Similarly, the contract outlines the crucial responsibilities of Schwab, thus, creating a basis for cooperation and the successful delivery of the end product to the customer. Overall, Schwab’s approach to contract development can be considered a prime example of how a contract should be structured due to the close focus on key issues and the clear delineation of all parties’ roles and rights.",
    "Differences between primary and secondary sources Primary sources are the ones providing first-hand evidence on the events or phenomena that one is studying. Such sources include diaries, photographs, video and audio recordings, interview transcripts, works of art, statistical data, and others. All of these types of sources give the researcher a possibility to learn about the investigated matter directly by observing it or reading/listening about it from first-hand witnesses. In case of the Chernobyl Nuclear Plant Disaster, the most relevant primary sources include reports, documents, and local newspapers of that time, photographs, and interviews of witnesses. By using such resources, one can obtain the possibility to learn unbiased facts and obtain the most relevant information about the event or phenomenon under investigation. Moreover, when analyzing primary sources, the researcher can become immersed in the atmosphere in which the object of investigation existed and the circumstances under which it developed. For instance, for historians and archeologists, such primary sources as ancient fossils or some tribes’ belongings serve both as sources of information and inspiration. On the other hand, for someone analyzing a political or environmental issue, reports and pertinent news releases will be helpful sources of reliable data. Meanwhile, secondary sources offer second-hand information and analyses from other researchers. Secondary sources include books, reviews, and scholarly articles investigating the subject of research. By analyzing secondary sources, one can get a deeper understanding of both the analyzed phenomenon and the primary sources. While primary sources offer a first-hand view of the situation, secondary ones enable the researcher to synthesize the material on the topic. Explain why it is important to consult a variety of sources when conducting historical research Both types of sources are crucial in research since they complement each other. Whereas primary sources offer credible evidence, secondary sources provide additional information and valuable synthesis. However, even when one possesses a primary and a secondary source, it is not enough for completing a thorough research endeavor. One needs much more than a few sources, however credible they might be. It is of utmost importance to consult a variety of sources when conducting historical research since in each new source, valuable additional evidence can be found. Also, when the same data occurs in several sources, its credibility increases. At the same time, the presence of different pieces of information gives the researcher food for thought and allows posing new questions and seeking new answers. That is why the more sources one has at one’s disposal, the better. It is crucial to consult not only a wide range of sources but also different types of them since authors of articles and books, for instance, have divergent approaches to synthesizing data.",
    "The development of the Chesapeake colonies is a bright example of how slavery became one of the integral parts of societies existing on these lands. The necessity to grow specific crops and use them to earn money and survive resulted in the constantly growing demand for the workforce. However, the practice of using indentured servants was ineffective because of the end date of their contracts. It meant that new sources of people to work on fields and plantations were needed. The resolution of the given problem was a matter of survival, as the inability to raise crops would mean death for the whole community (Kidd, 2019). Under these conditions, the development of slavery was inevitable as people stripped of their rights could be used to perform diverse tasks, and the term of exploitation was not limited. It created the basis for the evolution of slavery which became one of the fundamental institutions functioning on these lands. At the same time, the example of the Middle colonies proves that the enslavement of people and their use as a cheap workforce was inevitable. Although the pacific principles of Quakerism dominated these lands at the first stages of their evolution, settlers still needed people to perform complex tasks and support the evolution of colonies. Regarding the limited number of arriving settlers, slavery became the possible option to compensate for the deficit and create the basis for future expansion. The given trend was similar to the Middle and Chesapeake colonies, proving specific attitudes to slavery peculiar to people of that period (Huntley, 2019). They were ready to promote further evolution of this institution as the central way to support the development of the agricultural sector critical for survival and enrichment.",
    "In his writing, Daniel Spanjer claims that the Christian worldview has influenced the study of Liberal Arts. He discusses science and how humans are the products of the world – they are endowed with feeling and thought, which are beyond natural (Spanjer 3). The author differentiates the reasons for learning everything surrounding people and claims that thinkers can answer many questions, either logical or surreal. These people have developed a term worldview “to describe this holistic concept of learning, scholarship, experience and knowledge” (Spanjer 15). Even though sometimes they cannot agree on the solution to the problems, time helps them dissipate false beliefs. The other reading by Brad Green suggests the interconnection of words and faith. In the chapter. When transcendent realities and goals surround a language, it is magnificent, but when transcendence is taken away from it, it falls apart and loses its glory (Green). The word was sent by God to save humanity; He portrayed people through the words (Green). Hence, humans should follow God’s guidelines in the Bible because His sayings are truthful. In case the words are devoid of meaning, the speech is useless. The last reading by Dockery narrates about the Christian faith’s influence on learning. People are encouraged to think in Christian categories in order to sanctify thoughts and beliefs (Dockery 4). It is vital to seek God’s guidance and His calls that help humans contribute to the societal good (Dockery 8). Thoughtful believers are needed to revive faith-centered higher educational institutions because only such people will be able to promote gracious deeds. Hence, Christian worldview is again viewed as foundation of successful education and learning.",
    "Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation (NDT) is a scientific and clinical European journal. It is a collection of articles that analyze dialysis, transplantation, and nephrology research. Moreover, the NDT journal is officially approved by the European Renal Association (ERA). Thus, it presents crucial analysis and data for scientists worldwide. Additionally, the other article from StatPearls was selected as the source is included in the National Center for Biotechnological Information (NCBI). Therefore, the center distributes and stores information about scientifically approved research. The article focuses on the leading causes of chronic inflammation at the time of end-stage renal failure. In addition, the authors describe the impact of disease on clinical outcomes and the role of middle molecules as significant factors in the onset of pathology. The latest breakthroughs and research in dialysis are reviewed to stabilize the situation. The end stage of kidney damage is the stage of the development of chronic renal failure. In this case, the disease enters the final stage and threatens human life and health. Only a decrease in urine excreted (diuresis) is observed at the initial step. At stage 2, other signs appear, and nausea and a large amount of urine appear. At stage 3, the fluid does not leave, and diuresis stops. The kidneys fail, and acute renal failure develops, which leads to a deterioration in well-being. Treatment of end-stage kidney damage in adults involves taking medications. Chronic renal failure occurs in 200-500 out of one million people. Currently, the population with chronic renal failure is increasing annually by 10-12%. Morbidities with the end-stage renal disease lead to a person’s diuresis being reduced to almost zero. With advanced forms of chronic renal failure, pulmonary edema develops. At the moment, the prevalence rate of the disease includes about 759 people per million population. The incidence rate is not available for all countries globally, so it isn’t easy to analyze the information in detail. However, the average number of newly reported cases is 144 per million. The mortality rate is decreasing and currently stands at approximately 28%. Doctors prescribe a blood test to assess creatinine, potassium, and urea to determine the disease. Moreover, such a procedure as an ultrasound of the kidneys is performed. If necessary, the doctor prescribes catheterization of the renal pelvis and angiography of the kidneys.",
    "Elephants dance the polonaise, sea lions juggle balls, bears ride bicycles, a tiger jumps through a burning hoop – all these are attractions with four-legged performers that thrill the audience, especially the little ones. Nevertheless, animal rights activists have sounded the alarm because circus tricks are unnatural for wild creatures; they are considered mockery and torture. There should be a thoroughgoing prohibition on the exploitation of animals in circuses, as this issue is contrary to humane treatment and is a direct violation of their rights. Since the 1970s, numerous nations have been setting up laws to treat creatures and guarantee their essential protection. International agreements were concluded, recognizing that animals are sentient beings whose basic needs must be respected and protected (Marino 148). Significantly, the tricks taught to animals for the public’s entertainment have nothing familiar with their natural behavior. The only way to make them obey is to punish and deprive them of food so that the poor starving creature will do anything for a coveted bite (Arnold-Foster 146). Animals must maintain and express behavior specific to their species, and the concept of circuses contradicts this shepherd. Furthermore, the phrase “animal performers” often evokes positive emotions because acting is always associated with romance. However, unlike their human counterparts, animals never voluntarily choose the profession of actor. Circus experience means losing freedom forever, spending 95% of the time alone, in a cramped cage where animals cannot stand up to the full height and turn around (Ward 131). They suffer extensively, but there is nothing they can change because humans are more thoughtful and cunningly use force. It can be concluded that introducing restrictions on the exploitation of animals in the circus is a necessary measure in the current world. Creatures must be permitted to follow their instincts and be in their natural habitat because that is their fundamental freedom. All people must comprehend that the rights of animals must be protected and, therefore, one must refuse to visit performances that have been created through violence and cruelty.",
    "Commitment to health theory is a special model designed to determine the stages of development and behavior changes. This theory assumes the development of an internal state, as well as the acceptance of the desire to lead a healthy lifestyle under the conditions that any circumstances may limit a person. Moreover, with the help of this theory, the necessary level is determined, which indicates a particular stage of human health (Kelly, 2014). In addition, this theory assumes that there are no established differences, such as gender, race, and others, in order to build behavior aimed at developing a healthy lifestyle. In her research, Kelly (2008) uses the principles of the Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change. First of all, this is done in order to demonstrate certain stages of the change process. Furthermore, the model used sets specific requirements for health. Thus, the Commitment to Health Theory uses such principles as stages of change, decisive balance, and self-efficiency (Prochaska & Velicer, 1997). In this way, Kelly uses essential principles of this theory; thus, they are interrelated. Concerning advanced nursing practice, this theory can be used as a measurement of some patient indicators. Thus, this model will help determine the goals necessary for the patient to instill the desire to lead a healthy lifestyle. In practice, this theory will also help track the process of change and how to behave with the patient (Kelly, 2008). For example, at the first stage, the task is to instill confidence, as well as to indicate the importance of the necessary changes. At the second stage, strategies are already being applied to strengthen the patient’s desire to improve the overall state of health. The third stage is the final one, and it should introduce the behavioral patterns necessary for maintaining a healthy lifestyle. As a result, health care professionals can use stages of change categories and commitment ratings to personalize therapy by employing change-specific tactics and motivating therapeutic communication techniques.",
    "Being a knowledgeable and experienced professional in one’s professional sphere is, without a doubt, of great importance. For this reason, many students of medical education facilities seek to acquire as much theoretical and practical expertise as possible before graduation. Although such a strategy is by no means wrong, I have recently discovered that the true success in the work of healthcare providers is explained by the doctor’s ability to build relationships with one’s patients. I fully understood the advantage of this simple but often overlooked truth when observing Dr. Wang’s work. Dr. Wang is an experienced professional working in the sphere of eye surgery. Yet, it was surprising for me to discover how easily he/she is able to build close relationships with the patients. After analyzing her/his behavior, I realized that there are certain skills that allow Dr. Wang to gain the trust of the people that come to the Eye Surgery Institute. First of all, he/she is an active listener meaning that all of Dr. Wang’s patients are encouraged to fully and openly express their symptoms and feelings without being interrupted. Secondly, Dr. Wang is always polite and patient with people regardless of her/his overall mood. Finally, I noticed that Dr. Wang is friendly with regular patients as she/he is interested in their health and everyday lives. For instance, I heard Dr. Wang asking a woman regarding her daughter’s health because the patient mentioned that the latter was sick during the last session. As a result of such an attitude towards people, I saw that many treated people could share their problems openly with Dr. Wang as they trusted her/him. In turn, I saw that this allowed the professional to deliver better and more accurate treatment. Moreover, seeing the positive outcome that the ability to build a trustful relationship with the patients has on the healthcare provision, I have become determined to develop this quality. In this regard, I hope that my description of Dr. Wang’s practice will also inspire other current and future medical workers to develop their communication skills.",
    "One of the social factors that might impact what groceries are purchased is the lack of healthy food. Addressing Wal-Mart in Forest Part allows me to gather enough information about available products and their prices. For example, one gallon of great value milk is $2.65, one loaf of Sara Lee bread is $2.44, one bag of gala apples is $3.58, and one bag of organic baby carrots is $3.88. Continuing my visit, the prices are as follows: one yogurt container is $1.92, 2-liter of Pepsi Soda is $1.98, one bag of chips is $2.84, and one family-size pack of cookies is $3.98. In Maywood, IL 60153, the population is mostly African Americans (68.6%), but white citizens (18.2%) and Hispanic/Latino (26.9%) also live there (United States Census Bureau, n.d.). The chosen living area lacks good grocery stores, but the number of fast-food restaurants has significantly increased during the last few years. It means that people are not able to buy healthy food but have to eat poor-quality products, contributing to their health problems like hypertension and diabetes. Another social factor that affects human health and shopping habits is poor transformation and the impossibility for the working class to visit Wal-Mart regularly. The median household income in the chosen region is about $50,176, and the poverty level is about 15% (United States Census Bureau, n.d.). It means that not all individuals can go to the stores with good food and make decisions, not at the expense of their health. The combination of transportation, low income, and food factors are critical for public health (Islam, 2019). It is not enough to identify a problem but find ways to solve it and help the population achieve improvements. A community health nurse (CHN) is responsible for promoting public health and the choice of interventions to address food security. According to Schffer and Strohschein (2019), there are 17 interventions introduced in five groups with different colors, and collaboration is a unique opportunity for all community members to promote and protect health. The main characteristics of this intervention are a high commitment level, partnership, and goal orientation (Schffer & Strohschein, 2019). Collaboration at systems levels helps CHNs reach all appropriate stakeholders, community collaboration is necessary to analyze the current state of affairs, and cooperation with families improves personal knowledge and engagement.",
    "In the history of mankind, the computer has become one of the most important inventions. Hardly anyone can imagine a modern home or office without computers. While some people argue that the computer has provided us with additional conveniences, according to others, the computer has made our life more complex and stressful. I believe that computers, in the first place, have enriched our society with several advantages due to faster communication and easier access to information. The computer provides us with a fast way to communicate. In our time, when modern society is becoming more global, computers play an essential role in communication systems. Previously, communication was limited to means such as mail (Grudin, 2017). If a businessman traveled abroad, the sending of reports and reports, as a rule, was accompanied by significant delays. Since the competitiveness of a business depends on time, this situation was completely unacceptable. The Internet has allowed businesses to send messages instantly. Staff can send emails or instant messages to a manager anywhere in the world (Grudin, 2017). This has added efficiency to businesses and expanded business opportunities. For me, a computer is a technological necessity that makes my life more enjoyable and interesting. First of all, a computer is an excellent leisure tool. Watching movies and various sci-fi programs through my electronic companion is very convenient and comfortable. Also, my daily work, which brings me the lion’s share of my cash income, is not in the least tied to the computer, so it is not just a means of interactivity and entertainment but also a tool for making money. Physicians and other healthcare workers use computers for many essential uses. Computer hardware is widely used in making a diagnosis, conducting examinations and preventive examinations are examples of computer devices and methods of treatment and diagnosis (Farinella & Marco, 2018). Computed tomography and nuclear medical diagnostics provide accurate layered images of internal organ structures (Farinella & Marco, 2018). Ultrasound diagnostics and probing, using the effects of the interaction of incident and reflected ultrasonic waves, opens countless possibilities for obtaining images of internal organs and studying their condition. The diagnostics and treatment methods will be much easier with the help of computer intervention.",
    "In relation to building construction, Code of Practice may be defined as a particular set of standards, procedures, and regulations to which a contractor and developer should adhere to manage potential environmental consequences caused by construction works. For large clients, local authorities, and public bodies, it is applied to new developments and sets out requirements related to the impact of construction. It aims to provide guidance within the framework of legal, administrative, and technical systems for the protection of workers, the environment, and the public and control over major hazard installations. According to the code, by arranging separation between large centers of population, including housing, shops, schools, and hospitals, and major hazard installations and developing appropriate emergency planning, major accidents that may occur at these installations will be prevented. Code of Practice is applied to major hazard installations identified on the basis of a list of hazardous substances associated with threshold quantities. They require priority attention due to the potential for causing highly serious incidents that may negatively impact the environment and people. Thus, major hazard installations include oil refineries, petrochemical and chemical works, storage of flammable liquids, gas, and liquefied petroleum gas, fertilizer works, chemical warehouses, and water treatment works connected with chlorine. Nuclear hazards, hazards of a military nature, and the transportation of potentially hazardous chemicals are excluded from the code due to the differences in their control and management. In general, the code includes a list of activities for competent authorities that should be performed in order to establish major hazard control systems for the prevention of incidents. Competent authorities include government inspectorates and safety authorities, police, local authorities, workers and their representatives, works managements, fire and health authorities, suppliers of major hazard technologies, and other involved organizations.",
    "In the present day, the preservation of Confederate statues provokes multiple discussions. According to the official political agenda supported by former President Donald Trump, these monuments are the historical symbols of the United States that should be protected. However, more and more evidence supports the public opinion that Confederate statues should be removed as they aim to demonstrate racial disparities and the supremacy of Whites. The main argument of this claim is supported by the fact that the majority of monuments were erected not directly after the Civil War but in the 1900-the 1920s (Best, 2020). During this period, several discriminatory laws against Black people’s social rights were enacted. The construction of Confederate monuments was sponsored by the United Daughters of the Confederacy. In the present day, it was regarded as a part of the union’s long-lasting strategy that aimed to strengthen White supremacy and social inequities based on race. The connection of statues with structured racism is obvious as the second wave of Confederate monuments’ erection was in the 1920-1940s, along with “Black Americans’ fighting for civil rights and pushing back against widespread lynchings in the South” (Best, 2020, para. 4). Thus, Confederate monuments placed across Southern states, especially on courthouse grounds, aimed to demonstrate the protection of Whites by the law. The undeniable racial context of monuments’ construction has finally led to their removal or relocation during the last several years in response to discrimination against Black citizens. From a personal perspective, it is impossible to deny that Confederate statues were directly connected with efforts to strengthen White supremacy. That is why a considerable number of them may be removed – however, not all. In general, human history includes both positive and negative events. Although a considerable number of people prefer to destroy all attributes of tragic times, they should be remembered as well. In other words, mistakes of the past should be remembered for their avoidance in the future.",
    "Conflict management at the workplace is one of the crucial elements related to the organization of work in healthcare facilities. In this regard, McKibben (2017) asserts that conflict is an inevitable part of any human interaction, especially when the collective activity is associated with physical, mental, and ethical complexity found in hospitals. Consequently, if ignored or not handled adequately, the disputes between the colleges at the workplace lead to decreased performance and satisfaction levels of the involved employees (Suifan, Alhyari, & Sweis, 2020). This, in turn, negatively impacts the overall quality of provided patient care. Therefore, it is important to resolve the conflicts as soon as they appear. However, to understand how to manage disputes effectively, one should understand the factors that cause them. In general, all the antecedents of organizational conflicts may be divided into three groups, namely individual, interpersonal, and organizational. As for the former, Kim et al. (2017) argue that the healthcare professional’s self-esteem, self-focus, emotional intelligence, prevalent responses to conflict, communication styles, and overall worldview determine the frequency and severity of the disputes. In a similar vein, Chang, Chen, and Chen (2017) found that a person’s license level, age, and previous experience of working in other collectives can all affect the behavior during conflict situations. Interpersonal conflicts, on the contrary, are caused by such factors as lack of trust and respect towards a person, power abuse, and ineffective communication (Kim et al., 2017). Finally, organizational conflicts stem from the overall structure and work arrangement. In this respect, such factors as ambiguously defined responsibilities and inadequate hierarchy can cause dissatisfaction and disputes (Kim et al., 2017; McKibben, 2017). Therefore, this type of conflict appears as a result of weak or wrongful management decisions. I have also participated in several conflicts that can be explained by the factors mentioned above. Firstly, I have a friend who is generally a good person but who is quite self-focused; thus, he often fails to recognize other people’s opinions. Due to that, we usually have to do what he wants, which eventually leads to conflict when I become tired of compromising. Secondly, I have noticed that many conflicts between me and my parents and friends are caused by my inability to control one’s emotions. Finally, once, we had a conflict with my classmates while working on the team project as we failed to discuss the responsibilities of each person before starting.",
    "In many philosophies, some archetypes can be described as the perfect self in terms of the way of living one’s life. In Confucianism, such a man called junzi — a noble person or gentleman — is a common aspiration (Yu-kit 223). The combination of the highest qualities that an ideal human being should possess is an almost unachievable goal, yet the one that is held in high regard by many. This essay will describe the Confucian gentleman and compare this idealistic archetype with Plato’s philosopher-king. This idea that stems from the traditional Chinese culture continues to hold its importance for society. Such a man stands above evil ideas, recognizes them, and counteracts their effects to the best of their abilities (Yu-kit 225). Moreover, the Confucian gentleman helps others to do so through the transfer of knowledge (Yu-kit 223). Yu-kit writes that a noble person, according to Confucius, must take “a dual role of an exemplar and educator” (224). Virtues are the second nature of this man, and he exhibits them daily. The Confucian gentleman is the one who lives by the highest moral standards and aims to help others achieve the realization of this goal. Plato’s philosopher-king possesses several similarities to this archetypical role. They both are set to exhibit certain positive moral qualities while addressing negative ones through reason and rationale. He is ultimately humble and stoic and continuously seeks wisdom for the sake of the betterment of society (Mark). Notably, Plato’s archetype is more leaning toward education rather than living life as a role model for others. In conclusion, both roles possess certain qualities that define a noble person following moral qualities, such as kindness, fairness, selflessness, and the striving for harmony. However, Plato’s version of an ideal person is a stoic leader who puts wisdom at the highest value, while the Confucian gentleman is set to uphold moral values first. They are both set to uplift the personal values of other people through kindness and selflessness.",
    "Corporate entrepreneurship is the process by which groups inside an existing corporation build, foster, promote, and administer a new business distinct from the parent organization. However, these new entities emphasize the parent’s holdings, competitive positioning, knowledge, or other capabilities. The new groups may also be an oxymoron while again utilizing the unconventional approach to further economic growth alongside the meticulous planning, framework, and organization that several large firms have developed over time (Demirkan et al., 2019). Instead of reclining on their glories, the world’s wealthiest organizations, such as Amazon as well as Samsung, are progressively undertaking proactive innovation projects to prevent disruption. Amazon Custom is an excellent extension of an existing innovative initiative that has reaped the benefits of both evolutionary and radical tactics. As the name indicates, this ambitious new approach allows suppliers to provide customized items on Amazon for the first time (for example, custom text, customization, and so on) (Demirkan et al., 2019). Samsung’s innovative business strategy entails delegating new projects to an expert ‘creative elite,’ guaranteeing that they are prepared to include best practices and produce maximum KPIs (Demirkan et al., 2019). To achieve these objectives, the industry’s inventive elite use open innovation as well as corporate technical reconnaissance strategies. New product advocates explore ideas for new merchandise by independent strategic orientation, a bottom-up method. The iPod is an excellent example. It was built with the help of the company’s workers’ staffing and engineering knowledge. This approach adheres to the company’s existing strategies. Inspired strategic behavior is a top-down procedure in which policy is processed via the company’s pre-existing hierarchical structure (Demirkan et al., 2019). This process is consistent with the firm’s existing approaches, with the iPhone serving as an example. As a result, the most likely commercial development is induced business strategy. The focus of creative behavior strategy is on human effort rather than the technological aspect. It includes new ideas, products, and procedures into a person’s position. He subsequently becomes an expert in the field and works for the firm to generate fresh ideas.",
    "It is clear to modern people, as well as many people who lived in the 1930s, that the Second World War was inevitable. Some believe that the United States of America could prevent the outbreak of the war. However, this could hardly be possible due to several reasons. The American government maintained an isolationist foreign policy in the 1930s. The period was challenging as all countries had to address severe economic issues (Corbett et al., 2021). Americans wanted to concentrate on domestic matters, including a threatening spread of communist ideas (Russett, 2019). It is noteworthy that the USA could hardly interfere and have a considerable impact on European affairs due to the country’s comparatively low economic might. The United States was not a financial leader at that period, so its influence was limited. Moreover, the USA alone could not prevent the world war because it was outbroken as a result of the clash between European countries. The outcomes of the Treaty of Versailles laid the ground for the new war, as almost all stakeholders were dissatisfied. Germany accumulated resources and developed alliances with other dictatorships, so any country could not play a decisive role in this conflict. No nation could prevent the start of the new war as the regimes that emerged in Europe (the communist USSR, Nazi Germany, and fascist Italy) were likely to start a new military conflict that would inevitably grow into a world war. Therefore, it is possible to assume that the USA could not have prevented the start of the Second World War even if the American government had abandoned its isolationist foreign policy. At that, the country made a tremendous contribution to stopping the war and establishing a new world order.",
    "This paper will provide an analysis of the article “COVID-19: Impact on Nurses and Nursing” by Fauteux (2021). The abstract is supposed to be the opening of the article. It is a way to quickly introduce the reader to the results of the research. In this article, the abstract is a brief overview of the topic that will be discussed. However, it contains no information about the methods of the research or its results. On this basis, such an abstract cannot be called comprehensive. The article’s introduction is already more extensive, offering a general overview of the topic. It provides information that the times of coronavirus pandemic have affected nursing. In addition, the introduction has statistics, which introduce the reader to the subject in a tangible way. From the introduction, I learned about the general factors of COVID’s effect on nursing, including increased mortality, changes in work practices, and increased workload. This introduction can be considered extensive and adequate. The research method of this article is qualitative in that a review of a body of research draws empirical conclusions. These conclusions relate to the significant changes that have occurred in nursing and its nature. The study uses quantitative data that has already been processed and presents an overview of information previously analyzed. The result of the study is the identification of the main factors of change in nursing. These include the intensification of collaboration and innovation, the removal of practice barriers, the popularization of telemedicine, and the increased risks of burnout (Fauteux, 2021). I learned how much nursing has been affected by the pandemic. I was mostly interested in the increased risk of nurse burnout due to too much workload. I also learned about the popularization of telemedicine due to the pandemic, which was a revelation to me because the attitude of the patients to their health seems to have drastically changed after the virus outbreak. This article is beneficial in understanding how an entire division of medical practice can change under extreme conditions.",
    "Historically, law enforcement was founded on the need to ensure citizens’ safety, possession, and health and to safeguard the people from civil disorder and crime. As such, Harris (2020) shows that law enforcement’s lawful powers included using force legitimized by the government or arrests through a monopoly on violence. In its primitive system, law enforcement clan members banded together to enforce rules of the group on rogue members. The purpose behind enforcing societal directives, conducting human control, and empowering authoritative enforcement of those rules was to safeguard the people from rogue members. The community believed that any form of violence against any of them was tantamount to an attack on the rest (Harris, 2020). Therefore, to achieve its purpose, early law enforcement employed three fundamental features, no coercion, law enforcement had a wide array of tasks. The third feature was a critical distinction between the people legally endowed with policing responsibilities and those who carried out policing duties. Peace offices have the mandate of ensuring that whether on or off duty, they shall not commit any crime knowingly under the country’s laws. In the U.S., for example, peace officers are bound by local and state jurisdiction not to commit a crime. The other responsibilities of the peace officer are to not knowingly disobey the rule of law on criminal procedures, especially in such areas as detention, arrests, evidence preservation, and the use of informants (Schroeder & Lombardo, 2018). Further, no peace officer shall exceed their authority when enforcing the law, and no individual freedom shall be restricted by peace officers (Schroeder & Lombardo, 2018). Only except the law is police officers allowed to disobey the rule of law relative to the criminal procedures.",
    "The phenomenon of slavery is one of the most devastating factors that affected the lives of people of African descent throughout the years. However, it is essential to address the origins of racism and slavery in order to create a comprehensive understanding of these concepts. In the chapter “The Origin of Negro Slavery”, Williams explains that although currently slavery is deeply connected to the exploitation of African Americans, initially, populations of various races and ethnicities were occupied as enslaved people (Williams 7). Considering that individuals of all races were involved in slavery in the New World, racism emerged as a consequence of forced labor and was not originally connected to the targeted discrimination of African Americans. In the history of slavery, the first population compelled to undergo the severe process of enslavement was the Indians. For instance, Spanish explorers utilized Indian labor in their colonies to convert the population to Christianity, enforcing the necessity of slave labor on the individuals who refused to accept the Christian faith (Williams 8). Similarly, Great Britain and France supported slavery in the colonial territories; however, this event was not connected to racial predispositions but to the fact that slavery served as a preventative penalty for the indigenous communities. Nevertheless, over the course of history, enslaved Negroes became a highly more important asset in the slave trade due to the economic benefits, leading to the establishment of Negro slavery as a normal condition (Williams 21). As a result, racism and racial discrimination emerged, but the initial origin for substituting other enslaved people with African Americans remained economic, not racial. To conclude, the connection between slavery and racism lies in the fact that racial predispositions towards African Americans were caused by the overwhelming use of enslaved African Americans. As such, slavery did not emerge as a result of racism; on the contrary, individuals from various races and ethnic communities were involved in the slave trade. Nevertheless, after the economic benefits of using enslaved African Americans were established, negative racial stereotypes began to emerge, leading to the occurrence of racism.",
    "Culture is the entirety of social norms, behaviors, and customs which distinguish a certain society from the rest of the world. Naturally, some cultures have common features, thus forming cultural clusters. At the same time, leadership is a personality trait that transcends national boundaries. This does not imply that all people with power behave in the same manner, as leaders are also influenced by cultural norms. Behavior differences are evident in the way people in different clusters view time. Middle Eastern cultures are frequently juxtaposed to Western ones, particularly American. Beehner writes that while “most Middle Eastern nations are past oriented” and uphold traditions, “many Americans believe they can control the future and embrace change for the sole purpose of changing” (72). Barak Obama is an example of a leader who gained prominence by articulating the importance of change. The list of differences in leadership behaviors is not limited to the perception of the future. Crede et al. have conducted a study in which they ascertain cultural differences in relation to transformational leadership. (23). The most peculiar finding is that “transformational leadership exhibits stronger relationships with subordinate performance in cultures with low levels of gender egalitarianism values” (Crede et al. 23). This implies that the more traditional a culture is, the more successful leaders are likely to be in transformational endeavors. Altogether, there is a definite influence of culture on the conduct of leaders. Therefore, the definition of culture should include the importance of its effect on leadership behaviors. Not only does culture distinguish a certain social group, but it also underscores the likelihood of changes driven by people who have authority. After all, these people are the ones who make the most important decisions in society.",
    "The concept of culture is a fundamental phenomenon influencing all spheres of human life. It influences people’s actions, methods, and approaches toward specific tasks and daily interactions. Thus, Roseberry determines culture as a socially constructed and socially constitutive part of the context where all activities take place. It means that all other fundamental institutions and phenomena, such as power, economy, and history, comprise the culture. At the same time, being the way of life, it influences the mentioned spheres and preconditions for the emergence of critical processes in these domains. In other words, peculiarities of culture influence decision-making in political processes and historical events which took place at different stages of society’s evolution. Furthermore, the approaches to business in particular, and economy in general, depend on the values and visions peculiar to a bearer of a particular culture. For this reason, by understanding history and politics, it is possible to understand this unique notion and its layers. Rosebery also assumes that culture is socially constituted, meaning that many cultures share the same visions and values. For example, my own culture is similar to the culture of my friends and the people surrounding me as we live within the same context and share similar approaches. However, at the global level, my system of beliefs and visions differs from the same framework used by people from other regions to guide their decision-making and actions. It is explained by the social nature of culture and its unique character. It includes different perspectives and attitudes shared by people from similar communities and, at the same time, it influences their mentalities and visions. For this reason, it is possible to conclude that culture is a social construct influencing social interactions and fundamental institutions vital for everyday interactions.",
    "The process of forming states is not characterized by ease. It involves many different processes, including cultural strategies of strength. It is believed that this aspect in the form of actions of social agents is of particular importance. This is because they occupy a central place in such processes as the formation of alliances and the establishment of dominance relations. Understanding this concept can give a better understanding of the creation of Western Europe, China, the Islamic World, and India. First, it is necessary to understand what a social strategy of power is and what significance it has. Thus, it is defined as a particular area of practice where the creators of mass media have cultural influences and act as agents of social change. Thus, these sources form and influence public opinion, which may affect the formation of states. Gledhill emphasizes that the main reason for the difference between state and stateless societies is the centralization and non-centralization of power. Thus, the absence of the second aspect is expressed in inequality, and the absence of citizenship is associated with decentralization and vice versa with equality. Therefore, in conclusion, to understand the emergence of the state in the case of Western Europe, China, the Islamic World, and India, it is necessary to consider the culture strategy of power. Therefore, the author makes an attempt to distance from the generally accepted European principles and views on the role of social anthropology and factors in Chapter 3. In addition to many other political and economic factors, social influence is of significant importance. Social agents form public opinion and contribute to the formation of opinions. In this way, there is a relationship in the creation of the states of Europe, China, the Islamic World, and India and the social strategies of the authorities.",
    "Modification of personal computers required the development of more complex hardware and software. For example, buses, which are the communication channels between different internal components and peripheral devices, have become more advanced. Such three types of buses as address, control, and data are known (Farret et al., 2017). The latter is utilized for data exchange between the Central Processing Unit (CPU) and peripherals (Farret et al., 2017). The significance of the address bus is to assist the CPU in locating specific information in the memory, while the control bus regulates data processing. Data buses are represented as a multiple of two and currently include five types: 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 (Farret et al., 2017). These numbers indicate the bits of data that can be delivered simultaneously, and the larger ones allow for a more significant amount of information to be processed at a time. The number of parallel lines in a processor defines how many electrical signals can be exchanged between peripherals and the CPU. The most common operating systems on modern computers are 32 and 64-bit microprocessors. A 32-bit data bus contains thirty-two parallel lines between different structures. In contrast, a 64-bit data bus consists of sixty-four lines, allowing it to run twice as many data exchange processes (Farret et al., 2017). Hence, the fundamental difference between these two types of data buses is the speed at which they can process information. Similarly, the pace at which older versions run data depends on the number of paralleled copper wires between the CPU and other internal parts. Indeed, all these buses have one common function of interchanging data, but they vary in the rate at which operations are transferred due to their structural differences.",
    "Data science is the discipline that studies the life cycle of digital data from appearance to use in other fields of knowledge. It involves researching and analyzing substantial amounts of information and is focused primarily on obtaining practical results. The definition suggested by Os Keyes presumes that this science is the reduction of humanity to something that can be counted. This perspective is engaging in a way that Keyes’s perspective opposes the standard definition of data science. Perhaps, her expression implies that everything in this world could be measured since the discipline is concerned with countable objects and quantitative analysis. There is also an assumption that data science systems want to devour everything possible, including a human’s life, and quantify it. Finally, when it comes to the decision-making process, the systems eliminate the human factor, excluding individuals, thus making it inhumane. Numerous standardized tests are based on an algorithm that does not allow people to express their opinions. Typically, they are multiple-choice credits where one should choose the right answer. One mistake and one is at a point of no return. It means that systems only accept correct data, not allowing a human to err. As a result, humanity is accustomed to giving the right answers when necessary and at the same time being afraid to say something that will not be automatically approved. On the other hand, data science is vital in areas where mistakes should be avoided. For example, in healthcare, workers use different electronic systems that assist them in choosing the proper treatment and its dosage. Medication errors occur due to human factors mainly, for instance, when professionals forget to check the expiration date of a drug. Meanwhile, the system will suggest which pharmaceutical is better for the patient and ensure it is not expired.",
    "It was genuinely surprising to read Gerai’s account about the Dayak community, as it seems to represent an almost utopian view on sex and gender. Unlike Western perspectives that seek to distinguish the two genders, and raise one up at the expense of the other in some ways, the Dayak recognize the differences but see it as a benefit. Reading the account, it almost seemed as the culture promotes the empowerement of both genders based on the characteristics which define them (i.e., male strength, female persistence). These positives are then brought together to contribute to the wellbeing of society as well as personal relationships in a nearly egalitarian perspectives. It is difficult to believe, although greatly comforting to know that there are cultures as this. Unfortunately, most industrialized societies have the culture of severe gender clashes, and the characteristics of the gender are associated with negative aspects, such as Gerai notes, male strength is connected to aggression. I think it is correct to note that it is a matter of values, the values that are taught by society are the ones that people would exhibit. Western society gives value to hypermasculinity and aggression as definitions of males, exemplified via the genitalia and abusive actions such as sexual domination, assault or rape – therefore, the culture forms around this, being far removed from the egalitarianism and harmony of the Dayak. As shocking as that perspective may be, I agree that it reflects accurately the social element that has been created conservatively around rape for centuries. As mentioned earlier, rape is often attributed to natural biology, while in reality it reflects more the concepts of society. I think this perspective touches on both, it emphasizes the natural characteristics of the genders (strength for men, femininity for women) while highlighting its social features (men are praised, women are viewed as used and broken). It can be argued that it is built within our society, as there are certain connotations and stereotypes associated with sexual violence. For example, in a UK study, the label victim was associated with passive femininity. The feminization hypothesis holds true when it comes to rape, as victims, that are most commonly women (but can be men) are attributed feminine characteristics and greater judgment (men would not be seen as men anymore). Meanwhile the accused of committing the rape is given trait dimension of prescriptive masculinity.",
    "With thrombosis of the lower extremities’ veins, blood clots or blood clots form cavities, which interfere with the normal movement of blood. Over time, they can clog the venous lumen and even come off, ending in the heart, lungs, and other organs (Dalen, 2016). Unfortunately, it is often impossible to timely determine the initial symptoms of thrombosis of the leg vessels. However, if the skin changes color and swelling occurs where the blood clot is located, these are signs of vascular disease. When thrombosis progresses, its symptoms appear: acute pain and heaviness in the patient’s legs. These symptoms are provoked by the venous congestion below the site of thrombosis. The main causes of the disease’s development are blood clotting and damage to the vein wall (Thachil & Bagot, 2018). In addition, long journeys and old age exacerbate the risk of serious problems. It is also possible that the patient is taking medications that increase blood clotting, so it is necessary to ask him about this to be sure of the diagnosis. Ways to make an accurate diagnosis include duplex scanning, radiopaque phlebography, MRI, or CT. The combination of these methods will most accurately determine the severity and nature of the disease. After that, a doctor can prescribe a suitable treatment. Of the drugs, it can be injections of heparin and capsules of anticoagulants. If these methods do not help, then thrombolysis is necessary, which promotes resorption of blood clots. With the most severe outcome, surgery will be required. Undoubtedly, this is the last thing to do since it is always important to use all the other methods before making it. It may also be dangerous in the age of the considered patient. Thus, it is vital to use other methods and try to avoid any harmful consequences. Not only this will help cure thrombosis, but also save patient’s life.",
    "A Western scholarship has distorted the long history of African culture for centuries, and many of its basic principles have been viewed through the lens of colonization. As a result, the ideas and tenets of African philosophy have been appropriated and changed in value from the inherent parts of people’s nature into commodities. In their works, p’Bitek and Marimba discuss such concepts as culture, spirituality, and philosophy of African nations and how Western ideology has reshaped their presentation without fully understanding their meaning. The commodification of African culture and the imposition of European views on the distinction between culture and philosophy, religion and spirituality have disrupted African people’s ability to self-identify. The ideas by scholars show that African culture does not distinguish itself from philosophy or drive a line between reality and the spiritual nature of one’s being. European culture is presented as pragmatical and commodifying – it turns pieces of life that are meant to be used into objects for observation. p’Bitek writes that culture turns from “the way of life of a people” into “something that is bought and sold” (“What is Culture?” 14). As a result, younger generations of Africans, especially those living in Western countries, see their culture as a collection of souvenirs, not parts of everyday life. At the same time, they are subjected to the Western religions praising poverty and individualism (p’Bitek, “Man Born Unfree” 21). Ani notes that African-Americans suffer as they do not feel connected enough to traditional African society but feel a divide between themselves and European identity (49). Such disconnect leads to people losing their communal and generational identification. The readings discussed above show that African and European ideologies clash in many ways, and the latter assumes control over the presentation of the former. As a result, generations of people are removed from their culture, losing it or seeing through the distorted lens of commodification. African culture is inherently linked to philosophy, spirituality, living in the moment, and seeing the richness of life. However, it is turned into a tourist attraction, and its people are forced to perceive it through the eyes of foreigners, losing their inherent link to history and nature.",
    "In a narrow sense, the “zero-sum story” is a belief that there is a competition between racial groups, and any progress for one group is a threat to the resources and position of another (McGhee). This story is the mainstream paradigm for conservative media and has been told in different forms for years. The negative impacts of the “zero-sum” paradigm on the United States are massive and diverse. This mindset created additional economic, political, and social costs for all citizens of the United States. One of the prominent examples demonstrated by McGhee is the history of public swimming pools in cities across the US. At the beginning of the 20th century, there were massive public swimming pools in many US cities, yet at that time “public” mostly meant “white only” pools. After numerous drowning incidents, local municipalities were told to open the pools for all people regardless of their race, which provoked a backlash from the white residents. As a result, cities preferred to close or privatize the public facilities instead of allowing people of different races to use them freely. This is an example of the destruction of public goods and a massive cost increase for the whole population due to the “zero-sum” mindset. Another negative example demonstrated by McGhee is political in nature – many white people stopped pushing for social governmental policies regarding jobs and social benefits after the Black community joined the agenda. In the end, this means less social justice and social benefits for the whole country because the adherents of the “zero-sum” paradigm do not want other races to benefit from these policies. The arguments provided by McGhee seem reasonable and fair to me – they describe the past and current state of affairs in the United States well. The main reason I think so is the factual and statistical support of her position – it is very hard to argue that the US has significant social and economic problems due to racism.",
    "Diabetes of type 1 usually develops due to autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells in genetically predisposed individuals. The damage to beta cells occurs at a subclinical level for months or years in the form of insulitis. Patients with insulin deficiency cannot process glucose in peripheral muscle and fat tissues. This stimulates the secretion of antagonistic hormones such as glucagon, adrenaline, cortisol, and growth hormone (Lee et al., 2019). These antagonistic hormones, particularly glucagon, promote gluconeogenesis, glycogenolysis, and ketogenesis in the liver. Consequently, patients experience hyperglycemia and an anionic metabolic acidosis gap. Type 2 diabetes is the most frequently encountered pathology of the endocrine system organs. The core mechanism of disease development is insulin resistance (Lee et al., 2019). It is a decrease in the biological response of cells to one or more effects of insulin at its average concentration in the blood. Insulin resistance produces the inability of insulin-dependent tissues to absorb blood plasma glucose and disrupts glycogen synthesis in the hepatic. Persons with diabetes should eat according to a structured regimen and receive their medications with meals. For type 1 diabetes, a recommended diet includes carbohydrates from fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and skim milk. Patients with type 2 diabetes, complex carbohydrates such as brown rice, whole wheat, fruits, vegetables, and beans should be included in the rations (Sinclair et al., 2019). At the same time, for both types of disease should be avoided, consumption of simple carbohydrates such as sugar, pasta, white bread, flour, cookies, pastries. During the first type of diabetes, insulin Degludec (Tresiba) is required together with the diet. It is suitable to confound hypoglycemia in patients over 18 years of age. In addition, Zynquista is an oral medication intended to be combined with insulin (Sinclair et al., 2019). Besides, individuals with type 2 diabetes may require insulin if their diet plan, weight loss, exercise, and anti-diabetic medications are not achieving their target blood glucose levels. In that case, Insulin Degludec may also be appropriate; the oral drug is Metformin.",
    "The healthcare industry typically draws sufficient attention to patients’ education, especially when it comes to representatives of minority groups. That is why the article by McCurley et al. (2017) offers valuable information. The researchers demonstrate that Hispanic individuals deal with improved diabetes prevention when they participate in individual and group face-to-face sessions (McCurley et al., 2017). I believe that there is an apparent reason why such positive outcomes are achieved. It seems that face-to-face interventions are effective because patients have an opportunity to ask questions if they require explanations. Simultaneously, such educational sessions demonstrate that a patient is not unique with such a health issue. As a result, such interventions can improve people’s morale, which, in turn, will lead to increased motivation to take preventive measures and protect health. This information allows for supposing that face-to-face interventions can be suitable to my practicum project that considers measures to improve access to care among African Americans with heart failure diseases. However, the focus on patients’ cultural backgrounds should not lead to ignoring a broader context. This statement refers to the findings by Cajiita et al. (2017), who stipulate that the use of mobile technology in healthcare (mHealth) can promote better knowledge. These scholars focused on 129 older adults, and almost 25% were African Americans, to analyze whether mHealth leads to improved care (Cajiita et al., 2017). The use of mobile technologies can be as effective as face-to-face interventions because modern people spend more time online. That is why it is reasonable to rely on mHealth opportunities to improve access to care among African Americans. Finally, it is possible to suggest that combining mobile technologies and face-to-face educational sessions can result in the best outcomes.",
    "In order to prevent heart disease, cancer, and diabetes, people are required to adhere to strict routines, including in terms of diet. According to American Heart Association, people wishing to prevent heart disease must consume food which does not contain added sugars and high volumes of sodium, as well as saturated and trans fats (“Staple Ingredients”). Additionally, individuals need to eat whole grains, vegetables including frozen and canned ones, nuts, seeds, and meat such as chicken and lean beef. American Cancer Society’s dietary recommendations to people include the need to consume more fruits and vegetables, especially dark green and orange ones, since they have a considerable cancer prevention capacity (“American Cancer Society”). Moreover, the society advises people to eat foods high in fiber, such as legumes and whole grains, while avoiding red meats and added sugar. Finally, American Diabetes Association recommends eating more non-starchy vegetables, including broccoli, carrots, cauliflower which need to constitute one-half of each meal (“Eat Good”). The association also highlights the significance of consuming foods high in protein, such as beans, hummus, and lentils, as well as fruits and monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats. The recommendations to prevent the three previously mentioned conditions are, to a large extent, similar. Essentially, all organizations state that it is important to avoid consuming added sugar and saturated and trans fat. Additionally, people wanting to prevent heart disease, cancer, and diabetes also need to eat more fruits, vegetables, and chicken meat. At the same time, red meat is strictly prohibited for cancer patients while generally available for people with diabetes and heart disease. Individuals with diabetes should consume more non-starchy vegetables than people with the other two conditions. Finally, to prevent heart disease, people must particularly be careful about consuming any type of fats.",
    "One is watching the news or reading the latest article from Forbes, and you see the terms “business” and “economics” used interchangeably; one may wonder about the differences. Business and economics are similar in that they are supplements to each other, both dealing with the process of creating products and services and selling them to generate output. These are fields of study that are closely related and include a range of shared subtopics, such as enterprises, marketing, finance, manufacturing, and banking. Both are social sciences that focus on financial measurement and analysis, focusing on variables that impact the market and also focus on short- and long-term projections, as well as the inner workings of various industries. Finally, both business and economics tend to focus on various problems facing the nation, its citizens, government, and private enterprises (Vaidya). However, there are some differences between economics and business, which are based on their conceptual purpose. Economics is a study focusing on understanding human behavior and, in turn, how that reflects on the broader economic elements of whole nations. Meanwhile, business is aimed at studying the process of the exchange of goods and money specifically, and all the related elements starting from production to the final sale, and how a specific enterprise fulfills this process. It can be argued that business is a subset of economics, as the human behavior in that exchange of goods is a point of focus (Casson). A major difference is in concepts, economics deals with theories and broad elements of the economy, such as supply and demand, interest rate, and international trade. While these undoubtedly impact business, both individual entities and as a field of study, business focuses on the process of wealth creation within the context of the economy and typically applies practical theories. Economics focuses on and attempts to maximize the welfare of society, while business is centered on its shareholders. Both face different issues, with economics encompassing poverty, unemployment, taxation, and federal expenditure, while business focuses on product positioning and differentiation, marketing, growth or lack thereof of profitability, and individual or industry performance (Gitman et al.). While business and economics share many commonalities, their conceptual and practical differences make them distinct sciences.",
    "The difference between a doctor approaching a patient in comparison with nursing practice on the same subject can be an excellent topic due to the highlighted features that are emphasized when parallel. Thus, medical practice using one’s physiological status while nursing also implementing psychological responses is an effective way in making the difference between the two clear while operating based on PICOT. The points to be included are the difference in the research approach. Since medical practice is more objective due to the fact that it relies on specific outcomes and facts, the research is quantitative. On the other hand, the PICOT question included in the nursing practice implies mixed research that considers both opinions and data. Topic presents the differentiation between nursing and medical practice in terms of approach to diagnosis. The vital factor that is being brought up is the PICOT in relation to lab results versus assessment based on symptoms. The research can highlight the outcomes in terms of the accuracy of the findings while focusing on the comparison between the two concepts. The aspect that illustrates its importance is the overall parallel between the two models that may have similar results depending on how the research will be conducted and its findings. The potential research focusing on the nursing practice of preventing certain injuries and providing more patient-centered and personalized care can emphasize the importance of decision-making in the field. Decision-making is an essential concept in the nursing care field (Nibbelink & Brewer, 2018). Hence, a PICOT question on the topic of providing specialized care in terms of preventing falls versus solely treating them can be an effective way of discussing nursing from a personalized perspective.",
    "A digital engagement policy determines how the organization intends to position itself online. The regulation also covers the company’s brand qualities and its vision and mission objectives. It also directs how employees can communicate digitally, both internally and externally, with suppliers and clients (Brown, 2019). In addition, the above guidelines also target social media interaction practices that may affect the business, either negatively or positively. Our organization has a digital engagement policy that it utilizes to protect the reputation of its brand. Moreover, the above strategy has enabled the business to increase employees’ commitment while boosting the levels of their obligation. Hence, workers share more about the organization online, thus, contributing to more sales and profit. Additionally, with the above rules in place, the firm’s private information is secure since it is not shared online. My professional presence online is aligned with the organization because it entails displaying the company’s products and services and connecting with all stakeholders. My existence online builds a good relationship with clients, friends, and followers, which is advantageous to the business since the company image has improved. This has helped the organization become relevant because it has offered its clients a ‘human face.’ I use media platforms to promote my brand by focusing on different social networks. I also create informative and engaging content about the company’s products and ensure all the information is up-to-date and accurate before uploading. It is critical to do regular online marketing while avoiding over-posting not to look desperate. All the updates of accomplishments and newsworthy developments are done 3 to 4 times a week. The topics that I frequently post on social media to market my brand are about the pricing of the products. I also emphasize the benefits of using our merchandise and services while comparing with others in the market. I always comment more on the developments and accomplishments achieved but avoid posting any negative comments made by an individual or a dissatisfied customer because this could cause a destructive online discussion, which may diminish the brand. After completing the course, I plan to change how to respond to any negativity, and I will not ignore any undesirable feedback because it enlightens me about the buyer’s experience. In addition, I will also start to market strategically, for instance, to develop a procedure of targeting my audience depending on the social media network, have schedules for my content, and change the communication methods.",
    "The case under consideration, Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S., was significant for developing measures to avoid discrimination in the workplace. More specifically, it was primarily related to diversity in terms of sex and age since this combination frequently evokes the concerns of the population (King, 2021). The examination of the issue by relying on the example of Gerald Bostock was advantageous for establishing proper employment practices in this respect. In this lawsuit filed by the plaintiff, the main factor was his unjustified dismissal from the company in which he had otherwise positive reputation. This event was caused by the man’s interest in a gay softball league which he expressed while being in the workplace while neglecting the provisions of Title VII (Mallory et al., 2020). This part of the Civil Rights Act, confirming the violation, was relied on by Bostock when initiating legal action, but it was initially dismissed by the district court due to its allegedly erroneous interpretation (“Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S.,” 2019). The appeal, including the claim to include sexual discrimination in consideration, was successful as Bostock managed to support his position with the opposing statements of Massachusetts law, Chapter 151B (“Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S.,” 2019). In this way, the meaning of the previously used provisions regulating such cases was modified accordingly. To summarize, the examined court case based on employment law and, more specifically, discrimination against workers happened to be crucial for making adjustments. The previous evidence, as per Title VII of the Civil Rights Act did not include the particular considerations of sex and age. Hence, this gap was compensated for by this decision, and the consequent change in the legal provisions helped guarantee the equality of people in the workplace in the context of their diversity.",
    "There are several types of fake news, ranging from apparent articles to more subtle kinds of deception. People frequently rely on critical decisions on what they read in the news, such as how to vote in elections or what therapy to provide when they are sick. This is why it is critical to have trustworthy news. When individuals can’t identify the difference between true and fake news, critical social and political issues get muddled and misunderstood. A lot of false news is created with the intent of inflaming and exacerbating societal disputes. Most significantly, critical thinking is required while posting or researching on a certain issue, writing comments, and engaging in other social media activities. Many fake news articles are constructed in such a way as to elicit strong emotional responses such as fear or wrath. As a result, critical thinking and research are essential. It’s crucial to examine a few choices when spotting disinformation, recognizing fake news sites, and double-checking before sharing or posting a comment. First and foremost, double-check the source of the news or information. Fake news sites frequently employ addresses that sound like legitimate newspaper locations, but they lack authentic stories on various themes. If the website appears to be unsteady, go to the “About” page and seek a detailed description of the company. Second, look into the author. Check them out to see whether they’re reliable – do they have a strong reputation, and do they write about their field of expertise? Furthermore, the motivation of the author may be essential in the dissemination of forgeries. Third, fact-checking is necessary since trustworthy news reports will include numerous facts such as data, figures, and expert statements. If they aren’t there, inquire as to why. Reports containing misleading information sometimes contain wrong dates or time periods, so it’s a good idea to double-check the article’s publication date.",
    "Geographical distribution and location Banana is a popular fruit crop that grows all over the world and has several health advantages. Bananas are particularly significant in several low-income, food-insecure, least developed nations, where they may help with both household food security and revenue-generating as a cash crop. The crop is a key export item for a number of agricultural nations, and it is Africa’s, Asia’s, and Latin America’s biggest fruit crop in terms of production and commerce (MacKinnon & Cumbers, 2019). Bananas from Central and South America, as well as the Philippines, account for more than 90% of all exports (MacKinnon & Cumbers, 2019). The EU, the USA, China, Russia, and Japan are the top importers (MacKinnon & Cumbers, 2019). Banana output worldwide is projected to be 130 million tons per year (MacKinnon & Cumbers, 2019). Approximately 87 percent of bananas produced in the globe are consumed by farmers or sold in local marketplaces. Almost a third of it is farmed in Sub-Saharan Africa, where it meets more than 25% of the dietary energy requirements of over 100 million people (MacKinnon & Cumbers, 2019). East Africa produces and consumes the majority of bananas in Africa. Spatial Distribution Large supply growth in top exporting nations Ecuador and the Philippines, as well as strong rises in import demand, particularly from China and the European Union, are key drivers of trade (MacKinnon & Cumbers, 2019). Large retail chains from key importing nations are now operating directly in the global banana value chain. These networks buy bananas directly from growers and distributors rather than via typical fruit corporations (MacKinnon & Cumbers, 2019). The intricate web of interactions involved in the production, distribution, and trade of any given commodity may lead to genuine conflicts of interest among groups of individuals over who benefits the most from a product. Cheap bananas are frequently passed on to small farmers and plantation employees down the supply chain, resulting in lower salaries and working conditions (MacKinnon & Cumbers, 2019). Currently, the main issue in terms of spatial distribution is that large-scale banana production may negatively affect the environment, worker health and safety, and local populations. This occurs due to the frequently harsh techniques employed to regulate irrigation and plant diseases. Sources MacKinnon, D., & Cumbers, A. (2019). An introduction to economic geography .

    "Making Budgetary Control Effective A robust organizational structure is required for budgetary effectiveness. Permanent specific concerns, such as a finance committee and a budget director, should be established. To avoid bottlenecks, budget planning must be well integrated. Budgets for individuals should be harmonized with each other. Budgets must be reviewed on a regular basis to avoid them from devolving into a license to spend the entire authorized amount even when it is not necessary. According to Dauda (2019), “business organizations of all types must engage in financial planning at whatever level to ensure judicious deployment of resources for achieving organisational goals.” Workers should be appropriately compensated for performance in accordance with the budget. Sloppy staff, on the other hand, should not go condemned. Behavioral Aspects of Budgetary Control Budgetary control is a crucial instrument for performance evaluation. Nevertheless, findings take time to appear. Those in charge of fiscal control should have extensive knowledge and expertise in the subject. Workers are modifying their working practices, routines, and even their inter-relationships based on finances. As a result, workers may exhibit reluctance to change. It leads to the creation of each budget with the backing of top leadership. Each employee’s requirements are fully described and distributed in a formal structure. If this is the case, they will be aware of their power and responsibilities, which will be valuable for budgetary management. A financial management program’s effectiveness depends on the organization’s defined objectives. As a result, when establishing targets, management should exercise caution. Furthermore, the aims are explicit.",
    "Gendered behavior denotes fundamental expressions of gender socialization and identity through an individual’s various developmental phases. Thus, gendered behaviors refer to the ways persons behave according to their respective male or female genders (Au & Rudolfsdottir, 2021). One of the prominent gendered behaviors instilled in me during childhood was that women are the primary cooks in the home. Hence, from childhood, I learned how to prepare food for the family, unlike most male relatives around. Even the movies mostly depicted women as the cooks in the home. Perhaps the gendered role that I quickly adopted/ accepted from childhood was the idea that women are natural caregivers. The function depicted women as noble people who consider the plight of others in the home and society and consistently seek to alleviate suffering. Women are warm, nurturing, and caring. Thus, many regarded professions that require empathy like nursing and teaching to the women’s domain. The idea that women are more humane and caring appealed to me and caused me to accept the role. In my mind, the part admitted what many would prefer to ignore/ deny: women play critical roles in retaining sanity in the world. For me, the role meant that women could play vital functions in stemming the tide of oppression, suffering, and cruelty evident even from childhood. Therefore, the idea that women are more caring and naturally nurturing appealed to me because it placed the gender on a nobler pedestal. Despite the perceived nobility of the gendered role that women are more nurturing and caring, specific adverse consequences emerged regarding employment opportunities, as previously highlighted. In many ways, many subsequently considered women to be unfit for specific job descriptions like piloting, engineering, and doctors, which were better paying (Samidha, 2019). On the other hand, societies restricted women to courses like nursing and teaching. Most patients assume women caregivers to be nurses rather than doctors in the care centers. Hence, the role may cause conflicts when deciding on career opportunities.",
    "A lot of historical events and time periods have specific names. The renaissance, the enlightenment, the stone age – all of these were called such for a particular reason, and signify a way to differentiate one era from another. One prime example of that trend is the industrial revolution. Also called the industrialization, it was an important part of history and a big step in both technological and social development. Happening at a never-before seen speed, the process has begun and ended in less than a 100 years. The word “revolution” in “industrial revolution” is used to emphasize that fact, and note that the process is regarded as both an extreme and quick advancement in society ( Industrial revolution ). Like a real revolution, it also had a variety of effects on people and their lives. By changing the way work is performed and understood, it fundamentally shifted the people’s understanding of the economy, labor, and the world itself, driving both positive and negative change. For entrepreneurs and people starting their own businesses, the industrialization became a central source of focus and income, replacing the manual labor of people. It also created opportunities for new types of production and large scale manufacturing to be performed. The introduction of complex machinery profoundly affected the workers as well, driving the unskilled labor out of fashion and requiring a higher degree of both education and proficiency. Industrial revolution has made many lose their jobs, while a number of other people have gained new possibilities of employment via migrating into cities (Thompson). Industrialization drove urban development, and contributed to the establishment of the city as a central hub for human interaction. On a larger scale, the ability to mass produce goods and services has allowed countries to establish larger economies, expand trade, and start more thorough relationships with their neighbors. Overall, the industrialization age has had its ups and downs, but the significance of the process is hard to overlook, as it remains the basis for the society people see today.",
    "Miranda warning, also known as Miranda rights, is a formal statement in which a person being arrested is informed of their basic civil rights under the jurisdiction of the United States. Through this warning, an officer of the law enforcement notifies the individual of their right to remain silent, as well as to an attorney. Such principles reflect the foundation of the legal system of the United States, in which both sides are protected by a comprehensive set of rights in order to eliminate bias and enable an objective investigation of the case. The obligatory nature of the warning serves the interests of both sides of the process. First of all, the person being detained possesses an inherent set of rights, which must be respected within the framework of the court of law. They are guaranteed by the United States Constitution, and depriving a person of them would be a major violation of this fundamental law. Rogers and Drogin (2019) state that it would be a misconception to believe that every resident is fully informed of their rights by default. Furthermore, a failure to provide a notification of rights may render the defendant’s testimony inadmissible in court, as it can be dismissed due to possible coercion. This way, Miranda warnings align with the interests of both defendants and prosecutors. On the other hand, it appears possible to argue for the redundancy of rights in some special cases. For example, the arrest of a dangerous criminal or a person responsible for major terrorist threats is often deemed as not requiring a Miranda warning. In such cases, the situation may develop in a matter of seconds, making it necessary to incapacitate the perpetrator before starting legal procedures. From this perspective, it may be contextually appropriate to postpone Miranda warnings until the public safety is secured. In other words, the possibility of a direct, immediate threat to people’s lives outweighs legal formalities (Rogers & Drogin, 2019). Nevertheless, Miranda warnings should not be ignored completely, as they form the core of a transparent trial. Therefore, even if they are not presented at the moment of an arrest, Miranda rights will be given later once the situation is secured and prior to launching formal legal procedures.",
    "The doctor’s job is to follow ethical standards, including loyalty to patients and respect for their choice. However, the profession concentrates on philosophical, religious, and cultural traditions and beliefs. Physician-assisted suicide can be seen as voluntary death by a medical professional. At the same time, the doctor provides all the necessary means and information regarding the patient’s desires for the end of life. However, such cooperation on the part of a doctor cannot be ethically conditioned. Allowing euthanasia can cause irreparable harm to the patient if done incorrectly. Thus, a person can be left without the possibility of a habitual existence. Even though many patients who decide to die to suffer from incurable diseases voluntarily, the doctor cannot assist them. In this case, the moral commandment that a person cannot take someone else’s life is violated (Clarke et al., 2021). Moreover, doctor-assisted suicide is wholly opposed to the definition of a profession aimed at helping people. The doctor is seen as a healer, while physician-assisted suicide does not seem to control and calculate the risks, which can be a threat to many patients. The dilemma lies in the Hippocratic oath given by all doctors, one of the points of which is not to harm. Thus, helping a patient with a death wish can be seen as a deliberate wish to injure the person. Moreover, it may reduce the level of trust between patients and medical staff since taking a life cannot be ethically justified. In addition, the religious view forbids doctors to help patients at the end of life, referring to the commandment not to kill a person. Furthermore, killing may be considered offensive due to society’s moral attitude. The patient’s pain can be alleviated with the help of available medicines, while the loss of life is an irreversible action.",
    "The project aims to explore the questions behind people’s sexual orientation identification and the reasons behind it. Some people consider sexuality a subject of choice; others argue that the environment cannot dictate a person what sex attracts them. The latter group proceeds with the argument that sexuality is determined biologically, making it an aspect of one’s identity, which should be protected by the government (Sheldon et al., 2017). To further explore people’s perspectives on the matter, the project’s topic can be phrased as the following research question: does the environment affect people’s sexual orientation? While exploring the subject of the research, the following dependant and independent variables related to the topic were identified with the help of the GSS database. The dependent variable is sexort, which stands for respondent’s sexual orientation. The question related to this variable is: which of the following best describes you? This variable was chosen due to the fact that it allows determining what environment has surrounded the respondent. The independent variable related to the topic of the project is sexbirth, which stands for the sex assigned at birth. The GSS question for this variable is: What sex were you assigned at birth (for example, on your birth certificate)? The sexbirth variable was chosen since it is necessary to identify respondents’ sexuality and homosexual individuals for the research. There is an essential correlation between the two variables that can facilitate the project’s research. People’s sex identification significantly affects their lives and experiences. For example, the environments surrounding a male and a female can differ critically. As a result, such differences in the environment’s impact can affect people’s identification with sexual orientation.",
    "One of the main purposes of a leader of a business is to select the best course of action out of the available alternatives when it comes to the process of decision-making. Clearly enough, it is impossible without a thorough understanding of a company’s business environment. When it comes to entering the market with the goods for the purchasers’ consumption, the one theory that specialists often take to is the supply and demand theory. This theory is utilized to understand the customers’ buying behaviors and help managers strategize the product in the market in accordance with them. For instance, a lack of demand for the product signifies that supply needs to be shortened – and vice versa: when there is an increase of demand, it is reasonable to enhance supply of goods as well. Additionally, a supply and demand analysis helps in pricing: if the demand for the product is high, buyers are more likely to accept price increases an keep on purchasing it. With the low demand, however, prices should be sufficiently affordable; otherwise, the producer will suffer losses. There are various strategies to make the supply and demand model work to one’s advantage. Dayton cites an example of De Beers – a company specializing in creating diamond jewelry. Their vaults are filled with diamonds – but they manage to maintain high prices for gems by limiting supply. Thus, diamonds keep staying a rare commodity, for the acquisition of which as a status symbol purchasers willingly pay. Another organization using the supply and demand theory to their advantage is Zappo. Dayton states that the company’s primary idea of selling shoes online – that is, with no option of trying them on beforehand – did not seem like a good one. However, Zappo became a success story by having gained control over supply – their enormous assortment, excellent customer service, and a favorable return policy make buyers choose them time and time again. Finally, there is Apple – a renowned giant of the technology market. Their building of anticipation for the release of a service or a product is a manufacturing demand that makes purchasers feel like they are a part of something bigger than simply another gadget’s market entry. In conclusion, a supply and demand theory can definitely be used as a tool for navigating the market – one only has to search for appropriate ways to use it to their product’s advantage.",
    "The influence of social networks is increasing, pushing traditional media to second place. In particular, Twitter platform has become an influential tool for obtaining current information and even conducting debates on various topics. However, tweets can also be different and may or not impact society. This paper examines the Australian politician Bill Shorten’s tweet concerning the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS). Although the politician reports a joyful event in his message, he also expressed regrets about the current policy, limiting the NDIS activity. This tweet is meant to be both informative and grievance. At the same time, the author reports that the girl received assistance thanks to NDIS funding but also regrets that this was possible only after public coverage of the situation. As a result, Shorten deplores the current policy of the Australian government because of which NDIS has limited capacity to help people. While his tweet simultaneously has both negative and positive messages, it can have a positive impact. Criticism from an influential politician can draw attention to the problem and call on society and government to solve it. Several signs indicate the impact of the investigated tweet is. According to Casero-Ripollés (2020), activity, popularity, and authority are the main signs of influence. This post received 209 retweets, 50 comments, and 858 likes – such activity for a poorly discussed topic is quite a significant influence. However, the popularity of the issue is low, and in relation to the population of Australia, such indicators are small. Assessing authority, one can say that Shorten as a politician, is aware and concerned about the topic and has experience and knowledge to express an authoritative opinion. Thus, the tweet may be influential in discussing the activities of NDIS but not on the national scale.",
    "There is a growing number of physicians’ encounters with the victims of human trafficking, sometimes even without recognizing them as such. Recently, Todres (2017) reported an incident, where Dr. W was requested to screen the women-employees of such a firm for sexually transmitted infections. On the one hand, according to the Code of Medical Ethics of the American Medical Association (2011), it is necessary to safeguard patient confidentiality, including several aspects, such as physical, informational, decisional, and associational privacy. At the same time, it is obligatory to keep the records of all the patients in the healthcare settings while Dr. W was asked not to maintain them to avoid possible arrest of these women. Thus, the doctor understood that in another case, the employees of this firm would not have a chance for diligent healthcare and, moreover, could possibly spread the STIs further. The case engages issues in several fields, such as criminal law, ethical concerns, human rights, and service provider regulations. From the side of conspiracy law, it is possible to assume that the agreement of Dr. W is equal to the participation in the crime. As she is aware of the crime and did not report it but helped in its realization, the court’s decision can be not in her favor. From the point of view of human rights, prostitution is illegal in the US. Even more, if the minors are employed in the firm, the case falls under the mandatory reported law (Todres, 2016). Ethical considerations here also imply helping a child by breaching confidentiality. To conclude, the decision in the case of an encounter with human trafficking should be equivocal. By facilitating the activity of an enterprise engaged with human trafficking, a physician is partly responsible for the crimes and exploitation of women and children. Therefore, following the legal frameworks and ethical considerations, such cases should be reported.",
    "Feminist ethics is founded on the views that women’s subordination is morally inappropriate and that women’s moral experiences are as valuable as men’s. Vaughn (2019) states that the following are the practical aims of feminist ethics. Firstly, feminist ethics express moral critiques of behaviors and attitudes that reinforce women’s rights. Consequently, the vital goal is to provide morally reasonable means to oppose such behaviors and practices. Ultimately, feminist ethics’ objective is to imagine a morally good alternative that promotes female empowerment. Feminist ethical argument resurfaced in the late 1960s, first among the general public and then in academic discourse, as part of a broader rebirth of feminist ethical questions. On issues like abortion, fairness and equality, domestic work, sexual violence, and obligatory heterosexuality, the first academic feminist ideas were expressed. Nonetheless, the term ‘feminist ethics’ did not become widely used until the late 1970s or early 1980s (Vaughn, 2019). Traditional ethics, feminists speculated, was more thoroughly male-biased and required more radical reconsideration. Moreover, feminism is continuously engaged in ethical thought and discussion. According to Vaughn (2019), feminism is primarily a normative viewpoint, and feminists themselves regularly challenge its meaning. Lack of care for women’s interests, disregard for women’s concerns, rejection of women’s moral agency, devaluation of feminine ideals, and depreciation of women’s experience are all manifestations of feminist obstacles. Putting women’s interests first, considering women as ethical experts or authorities, exchanging male for female values, or extrapolating directly from women’s moral experience are all illustrations of how feminist ethics has been stereotyped and viewed. Essentially, these stereotypes are widespread and inaccurate; feminist ethics is significantly more extensive and more open than the misinterpretations suggest. To summarize, modern feminists are experimenting with new methods of thinking about moral themes that are attentive to their specific particularity and inherent shared worth, such as shared humanity, fairness, and impartiality.",
    "The concepts of domestic violence and abuse refer to psychologically or physically aggressive behavior of one family member towards another. This aggression could take the form of beating, rape, screaming, and humiliation. Unfortunately, in the modern world, these are common phenomena. According to statics provided by Huecker et al. (2021), 10 million Americans per year suffer from violence and abuse. The victims of domestic violence and abuse feel depressed and helpless, and their self-esteem is also extremely low. Fear of the aggressor might force a victim to keep calm about the experience of being abused. Nonetheless, there are signs via which a provider could suspect domestic violence, child abuse, or elder abuse. If a woman arrives at the emergency room with bruises or fractures that do not as she slipped on the wet floor, a nurse could suspect that her partner beats her. In addition to that, victims are highly likely to be depressed and anxious even though they might try to hide these emotions (Lloyd, 2018). A provider has a reason to be concerned with child abuse if a young patient is underweighted without objective reason and is afraid of other adults. In addition to that, a child might get severely scared with a loud sound or sudden movement. As for older adults, a nurse could suspect abuse if they have bruises, broken glasses, or walking stick, show signs of depression, and fails to take medications properly. Another warning sign is the refusal of a caregiver to leave an older person alone with a nurse. Undoubtedly, caregivers might not be willing to leave in some cases because they worry about missing information on an older adults health. However, a strict refusal to follow the requests of the medical staff and negotiate is a bad sign. In every health facility, a nurse who notices the signs of abuse and domestic violence must report them to the relevant authorities. More precisely, in the case of child abuse, medical staff contacts social services via hotlines or a written statement. The fact of elder abuse should be reported to the agencies on adult protective services. Finally, a nurse should inform the local law enforcement of the case of domestic violence. Still, before informing the related agencies, a nurse should discuss the case with a physician or a nurse practitioner and exam the patient without the potential abuser in the room.",
    "Introduction The fashion industry is one of the most dynamic sectors around the globe, and the dynamism arises from the diverse needs of the client base. Fashion is a personal statement and a symbol of societal status that also defines a person’s culture and individuality. As a result, clients are always curious about fashionable pieces that serve several factors while maintaining a particular budget. Although many clothes stores stock a variety of fashionable clothes, they do not capture the clients’ personality and individual needs because the designs are premade. Most stores such as Zara and H&M invest significant funds into identifying the unique needs of their clients. However, their reach in identifying these needs is not yet global, and this implies that a significant section of the target market buys what is available. Therefore, bridging the gap between what the clients want from their preferred clothes stores and what the stores are offering is crucial in promoting customer satisfaction. Our project, Be-Unique , intends to solve this problem by leveraging technology to bring the services closer to the clients. The purpose of the project is to provide a highly integrative platform through which customers can digitally access their favorite clothing stores. The platform intends to revolutionize the fashion industry by offering clients an opportunity to present their unique designs for customization. Online clothes from stores such as Zara and H&M are made using standard sizes that may not fit all body sizes within the standard measurements. Our online stores’ mandate is to ensure that clients have easy access to thigh-quality fashionable items that can be customized to fit their unique sizes. Therefore, our mandate will include offering the clients an opportunity to submit their sizes to our platform, whereby their clothes can be tailor-made to fit their unique sizes. Our highly skilled team will be on standby to take clients’ measurements and submit them to the famous clothes stores for customization.",
    "The editing in the first episode of the series Money Heist is in line with its thrilling plot and rapid action. In the first scene, as the character gets ready to exit her vehicle, the editing is quick, focusing on the items she is picking up. Similarly, the camera often focuses on objects, leading the viewer towards the items that will become an essential part of the narrative. For example, one can see the ringing phone before it is picked up. Moreover, the show uses rapid editing with close-ups and the use of objects that identify characters – guns, money, and other items that show one’s motives or their identifying trait. The characters’ close-ups are dynamic, often using dolly shots to slowly expose the background or move with the character. This way, the camera does not stop as long as the characters move or the whole room is exposed. When they stop, the editing is as rapid as the conversation between people. In monologues, the dolly is used again to keep the tension as the series requires a serious tone in many scenes dealing with life-or-death scenarios. Notably, the character in a close-up is rarely placed in the center of the screen. The shot is divided into thirds vertically – and the characters stay in the first or third part. Hand-held shots are also used, and they are consistent with scenes where characters feel insecure, aggressive, scared, or exposed. Moreover, when the characters are walking, the camera moves at the same speed. The change between steady dolly movements and hand-held “shaky” shots is needed to juxtapose moments focused on action and interpersonal drama. Moreover, tension is the primary source of emotion, and the editing keeps enough suspense by using close-ups of characters rather than an overview of the whole room.",
    "The Supreme Court ruled that Static Control’s claim of violation of the Lanham Act clause falsifying advertisement was valid. The underlying issue in the case was that the Supreme Court had to determine the meaning of the provision by applying the traditional principles of interpreting the statute (Campbell, 2020). The second issue is that labeling the claim by Static Control as a prudential standing question was misleading (Halbert & Ingulli, 2020). Lexmark bases the arguments on the prudential standing of Associated General Contractors. However, the case has strong grounds on statutory provisions that the Supreme Court had to ascertain in terms of statutory interpretation. The causes of the statute violations damage the plaintiff’s reputation since they fall within the zone of interest covered by the statute. The Supreme Court presumed that the statutory cause of action extended only to plaintiffs for whom the invoked law protects their interests. According to Bennett v. Spear, 520 U. S. 154, the span of the zone of interest varies depending on the law at issue (Tavares, 2021). The Lanham Act includes statements of purposes such as the people engaged and protection against unfair competition. Common law depicts unfair competition as causing injury to a business’s reputation or sales. The plaintiff must then show that they suffered a commercial interest injury within the zone of interest in a false-advertising suit. The Supreme Court also presumed that the statutory cause of action is limited to the plaintiff whose injuries arise from the proximate cause of the violation of the statute. For example, in the case of Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corporation, 503 U.S. 258-270, the statutory cause of action bars suits from damages that are remote from the defendant’s unlawful conduct (Jones, 2019). However, since the Lanham Act only allows commercial injury lawsuits, the proximate cause of the consumer deception is not fatal as required by the statute. The principles act as guidance than the direct-competitor test, reasonable interest by the Sixth Circuit, or multifactor balancing test recommended by Lexmark. The principle also outlines that the claims by Static Control fall under plaintiffs authorized to sue under §1125(a). Static Control can sufficiently allege that it lost sales and suffered injuries in its business reputation within the zone of interest caused by Lexmark’s misrepresentation.",
    "Marketing is one of the most critical aspects of every business, which makes organizations look for effective ways to attract new customers. However, not all marketing activities are fair or ethical, and targeting uninformed consumers is among them. One should explain that uninformed consumers are individuals who lack the psychological or mental maturity to make reasonable decisions and purchases. Examples of these people are children, the elderly, and individuals with psychological conditions. Consequently, it is unethical to target such consumers because this practice can provide these people with adverse outcomes. Many factors explain why it is unethical to target uninformed consumers. The first robust argument comes from the definition presented above. Since these people do not have psychological or mental maturity, target marketing can force them to purchase unneeded items. Consequently, this marketing approach is a form of manipulation of unprotected populations. The second reason refers to the fact that it is challenging for uninformed consumers to locate sellers’ lying. As a result, organizations can provide customers with false information to stimulate their buying behaviors. Irrespective of this information, some people claim that there is nothing wrong with targeting uninformed consumers. This point of view relies on the belief that such customers represent new markets, and organizations are free to enter and benefit from them. However, it is challenging to deny that these consumers are vulnerable populations, meaning that they deserve a specific attitude. That is why it is unethical to target uninformed customers. In conclusion, the essay has presented robust arguments of why organizations should refrain from targeting children, the elderly, and people with mental conditions. Even though some people and businesses stipulate that these populations are suitable for marketing, it is better to avoid them. The rationale behind this statement is that uninformed consumers do not have psychological maturity, meaning that target marketing can force them to make unreasonable decisions and purchases.",
    "The European powers had taken major parts of the world, including the Caribbean. In the 15 th century, the Europeans claimed the region following the establishment of Spanish settlements and conquest of the Aztec and Inca empires (Horne, 2018). Due to the conquest, it was easy for the Spanish to invade Mexico and Peru through exploration in strategic points of the Caribbean region. Following the Spanish invasion of the Caribbean in the 17th century, other European powers such as the British and French started settling in pivotal points such as the island of Tortuga and later moved to Jamaica (Horne, 2018). By mid-century, many non-Hispanic privateers had established permanent colonies and trading zones in Caribbean islands. The profitability in terms of wealth enabled rise of conquest to Caribbean region. First, it was easy to obtain gold, which was among the region’s key aspects of the scramble. The existence of Christopher Columbus in the region had shown the way for other leaders to set colonies (Horne, 2018). Second, there was the availability of a labor force drawn from the African continent as black people were used as slaves to work in the industrial openings in the area. Due to the decline of Spanish power in the region, majorly as a result of reduced native population of the area, the other European powers boosted their presence in areas that Columbus had covered. For example, Francis Drake, a privateer from England, attacked many Spanish settlements (Horne, 2018). The collaborative base between the French, British and Dutch made it possible for European powers to conquer the significant area of the Caribbean. After start of the competitive nature of colonies, sovereign battles emerged that led to stiff wars that made it hard for the Caribbean islands to unite against European rule (Horne, 2018). Because of the emergence of agricultural activities, the Atlantic slave trade saw many Africans work for the Europeans in the Caribbean, strengthening their colonialism in the area hence conquering the region significantly.",
    "Introduction Back to the Future is a unique film of its time, which has become a cult film thanks to its gripping plot and attention to detail. Screenwriter Robert Zemeckis created a movie about travel, pitting opposing personalities against each other who later became perfect partners. Thesis: Robert Zemeckis created an award-winning film that changed views on cause and effect and interactions through plot structure, character development, and setting. Body Paragraphs   * The plot structure of Back to the Future keeps the viewer interested in the film through logical cause-and-effect relationships.       + Each moment in the film is connected to the last moment and the next, weaving them into a unified structure.       + The scene begins with a ticking clock, then shifts to the theft of the plutonium and a focus on Marty, who is unaware of what was stolen under his bed.       + Marty ignores the safety of the clock tower, but later it turns out that he was around when the tower stopped.   * Character development in the story is built on the opposites of Marty and Doc, who elusively turn out to be people with similar histories.       + Marty is relatively quick and restless, though Doc seems judicious and prone to over-analyzing the situation: together, their work is coherent and efficient.       + Marty uses teenage slang while Doc uses proper speech: their different characters allow them to see the best in each other and develop as individuals.   * The film’s setting is new and unusual for the time of its creation, so the viewer’s eye is drawn to the screenwriter’s love of detail and desire to fill the film with characters from different eras.       + The differences in road construction quickly determine the time difference: in the ’50s, some were dirt roads.       + The film revisits the clock tower, which was in operation in the ’50s and stopped in the ’80s. Conclusion Back to the Future reveals to the viewer a new reality in which everything is interconnected: logical connections, people, and places. Zemeckis has created a unique story that amazes audiences with its details, developments, and shifting eras.",
    "The study showed that bibliometric analysis of evidence gathered from integrative reviews and analytical studies had substantial implications for nurse-related and evidence based policy changes. Primarily, this is possible through the use of integrative reviews in designing new programs (Benton et al., 2020). The collective database of the synthesized studies as suggested by the authors of the study, can be utilized by nurses to be empowered through evidence-based materials in the formulation of changes in universal health coverage. As such, the applicability of this information has a number of benefits for working nurses, as they will be able to employ concise and trusted resources when advocating or implementing changes to policy. I think that nursing practice can be vastly improved with the use of well-managed databases that employ evidence-based research. This is because such a database will be able to illustrate gaps in knowledge of overarching issues as well as daily medical practices in the sphere of nursing (Houser, 2016). Similarly, it allows for insight into nurse-specific fields such as nurse education, care for the lederly, emergency care, and more. Currently, accessibility to extensive and complete information that is formed through evidence-based research is limited due to a number of factors. In order to better provide such informative materials among working nurses it is essential to reduce bureaucratic processes and integrate technology into the process. Modern technology allows for low-cost and time-saving methods of information sharing, which will be largely beneficial for nursing. As mentioned prior, evidence-based research has the potential to reveal gaps in information in nurse-specific practices that would otherwise be unseen. I believe it is essential to make such knowledge accesibile and cohesive to promote better nursing care and work quality.",

    "It is a film about the fragility of masculinity, men’s mental health, and how they are interconnected. Fight Club is a crude portrait of what happens when men’s insecurities turn into masculinity in overdrive. Thus, this film represents toxic masculinity. Fight Club shows men dissatisfied with the state of masculinity. The characters are different in that many of them were raised by their mothers because their fathers either left the family or got divorced. According to Ta, the result is that the characters see themselves as “a generation of men raised by women” (270). In their life there is not enough male education for the formation of their masculinity. It confirms the idea of phallocentrism, which is based on the image of castrated women. Women raise children so that they can enter into the symbolic order. Fight Club is a wicked satire about finding, nurturing, and destroying yourself. It challenges ideas of masculinity, adding to the image of a real man several features that can be called associative and setting self-destruction and a destructive impact on society as one of life’s goals. The victory of Jack’s subpersonality over Tyler on the roof of a skyscraper shows that the good in a real man can overcome the destructive element. The ability to self-sacrifice and responsibility for his actions in Jack, who has gone through the evolution of masculinity, inspires some optimism, but the finale remains open.",
    "In the development of nursing in Europe in the 19th century, the activities of an outstanding personality, the Englishwoman Florence Nightingale, played an important role. Florence was looking for an opportunity to help the poor and the sick. At that distant time, activities related to mercy, helping those in need, were considered an occupation not worthy of a noblewoman. The young woman sacrificed personal life expensive relationships with her parents but remained faithful to her calling. Furthermore, her values and commitment allowed Florence to become a historical figure in modern nursing, to whose leadership people owe accolades for paving the way of nursing’s place in our societies. Thanks to perseverance and perseverance, in 1851, Florence entered the community of the sisters of pastor F. Flender in Germany, where she received a nursing education. Subsequently, Florence made a considerable contribution not only to the treatment of cholera help in wars but to the development of leadership and the reformation of nursing (Kim, 2020) The selfless woman became an example of service to people and a prototype of international mercy. Moreover, Florence managed to change a common thought about nobility of nursing, her leadership allowed to reestablish pivotal understanding of nursing practice. Her significance can easily be depicted on a medal with her image, which is awarded for special merits to distinguished nurses. A large role in the development of nursing abroad belongs to the international society of the Red Cross. The International Committee for Relief of the Wounded, headed by A. Dunant, convened a conference in Geneva in October 1863 with the participation of representatives of 13 countries, at which the charter of the International Organization of the Red Cross was developed, and the emblem of the society was adopted. The United States achieved tremendous success in the development of nursing in the 19th-20th centuries, when the American Medical Association was first established. (AMA) (Kim, 2020) In 1873, the first three nursing schools were opened in the USA according to the model of the F. Nightingale schools in London (Kim, 2020) Thus, the further formation of international humanitarian organizations was also primarily made possible by leaders such as Florence.",
    "Diana Kendall claims the current perception of the class has been a construct of the media and based on the construction, the meaning of class is determined. Kendall argues that the media has legitimized inequality in the United States through the assumption, with television programs and newspaper articles creating and reifying class-based stereotypes. Furthermore, Kendall argues that class discussions in the media are rarely explicit; however, their portrayals generate perspectives that impact human behavior. The upper class in society is portrayed positively, while the lower class is framed negatively. On the one hand, the upper class contains individuals that should be emulated, comprised of caring and generous people, and those with criminal records have remarkably good lives (Kendall 10). On the other hand, the lower class is framed as homeless, poor, largely ignored by the media, and often discussed as abstract statistics. As such, when casting a human face, the demographics of the poor determine how they are framed. The quality of life may deteriorate from the understanding that as the media focuses on the upper class’s viewpoints and gives voice to their concerns, it neglects the concerns of lower-class members. The conveyed class discourses by the media, including constructions of the homeless and the poor, portrays a lifestyle inflicted by laziness, diseases, crime, and substance abuse (Kendall 94). The dehumanized statistics associated with personalized suffering portray people detached from the broader contributing factors like unemployment, ignorance, laziness, or otherwise responsible people for their misfortunes (Kendall 94). Therefore, courtesy of the detachment, the life quality of the low-class individuals continues to deteriorate since the uneducated and the poor’s needs are overlooked. With attention given to upper-class individuals, the needs of the poor are not voiced; therefore, their lives continue to be exposed to deterioration risks.",
    "Although the Monster can be considered a bad character due to murdering people, the creature has good traits as well. The Monster is described as ugly and strong but at the same time, inexperienced. Firstly, Frankenstein’s creature is described as “its gigantic structure and the deformity of its aspect … instantly informed me that it was the wretch” (Shelley). Despite his ugly and terrifying appearance, the subject did not have the intention to kill people. The creature can be compared to a baby who tries to examine the world it lives in, and its actions are just contractions to the cruelty of the world. Frankenstein’s monster is not a real monster; it just seeks love and attention that the world cannot give him. The creature’s emotionalism is a positive feature as it allows it to understand people’s feelings and share them. The “Gothic” elements of the novel include supernatural motives, the architecture from the Middle Ages, and the spiritual aspects of human nature. Other “Gothic” elements consist of the strive for knowledge, the Monster, and the probable moral fall of men. I like that genre because I like looking at diverse issues from various perspectives. This novel allows me to look at the actions of Victor Frankenstein and the Monster and understand their motives and feelings. I also appreciate novels that aim to show moral aspects of society with the utilization of different symbols, such as the Monster. Mary Shelley’s husband believed that inappropriate social relationships are the result of people becoming evil. To make people bad, other representatives of society should reject them and make them feel useless or bad. I agree with this opinion, as people’s intentions are generally based on their experience of social interactions. If society treats people as if they were misconducts, there is no reason to try to be good or fit in. I believe that one of the integral themes of the novel is loneliness. The Monster aimed to integrate into society; however, people met him with disgust, fear, hatred, and all the spectrum of negative emotions. Hence, the creature turned to evil because of the feeling of loneliness. Nowadays, society often tries to isolate individuals who do not view the world the same as most people do. This feature often leads to the feeling of being lost and lonely.",
    "The concept of “gender roles” is often applied to the analysis and comprehension of writings from various historical periods. These responsibilities appear to have been firmly defined during the Anglo-Saxon period. The poem Beowulf belongs to the epic or heroic poetry genre, which has poems that commemorate the characters’ brave and martial actions. Women are portrayed as belongings for the advantage of the men throughout Beowulf and are made to support the male characters. In addition, women are utilized as plot devices to advance the story tale of men. Women, on the other hand, are a minor character in the plot, their presence being overshadowed by the men. The queen of the Swedes was given no name, her identity being secondary to her status as the king’s wife, Onela. The males, such as Hrothgar, Beowulf, Wiglaf, and Unferth, occupied the majority of the storyline of the poem. As a result, mentions of women are few and far between in comparison. “…the Helming woman went on her rounds…treating the family and the collected troop,” the poem says of a woman who fulfills traditional gender responsibilities as a character Beowulf (Heaney 620). The passage represents the expectation of women in the eleventh century, that they should look after males and be gentle. Queen Modthryth was presented later in the tale as the antithesis to Queen Hygd, who was autonomous and despised by men. “Even a queen of great beauty must not overstep like that,” they said dismissively. (Beowulf 1940-1941), until she married Offa, who rewarded her for her self-control. Queen Modthryth was only considered acceptable by society once she married, implying that women had less value unless they were married.",
    "Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) have become a part of all humans’ lives, but they remain a debatable issue thus far. Some people argue that it is not ethical to change any genetic information and play God (MacKinnon & Fiala, 2017). However, I believe that GMOs are only another advancement in people’s lives as the creation of machines, cars, or spaceships. GMOs (be it a plant or animal) are a part of my life as well, as I have consumed GMO-based products. I am not concerned about long-term effects as much as some of my peers since I find GMOs to be a product of selection that has been in place for centuries. People have noticed some properties they considered to be appropriate for them and tried to grow as many plants and animals that have certain qualities as possible. I would use the principles of utilitarianism to support my claim. This theory is based on the view that everything is ethical if it contributes to as much good for as many people as possible. GMOs can help people overcome one of the major problems that is famine. GMOs are resistant to harsh environmental conditions, so people may grow more crops and other important plants. Millions of people still starve and are in need of food, so the production of more food is beneficial for all. Of course, some use the deontological approach and state that it is simply wrong to interfere with genetic codes as it is the divine domain. GMOs are seen as people’s attempts to play God, which is morally wrong. However, I would stress that even according to the Bible, humans were given the planet to take care of it, so using innovative tools is another way to follow the Christian postulates and take care of all creatures.",
    "The issue of the internationalization of companies is a phenomenon that has consistently attracted the attention of researchers in the field of management. In the last decade, the focus has shifted from considering the benefits and risks of internationalization to studying the strategies of international companies operating and developing. However, it should be remembered that globalization acts as a kind of institutional environment for global companies, characterized by high uncertainty and risks and a non-monotonous, dynamic nature. The main incentive for the globalization and internationalization of the company is a significant expansion of market opportunities, both production, and trade. This is also connected with the benefits gained from implementing an international strategy, namely the growth of the company’s market, economies of scale and learning, and, of course, the advantages of new locations. Many companies from developing countries such as China, India, and Taiwan are active in global value chains in high-tech sectors of the economy (Stallkamp & Schotter, 2019). However, this fact leads to the fact that there is the broadest range of problems inherent in international companies in these countries. For example, emerging markets often have inadequate government oversight and regulation levels, leading to global companies’ unethical and criminal trading practices. For example, a typical example of this is the exploitation of cheap local labor to make production more affordable for international businesses (Mashan, 2021). This is morally and ethically appalling in the extreme but will have dire consequences for the company in the future. Given the benefits of international diversification, some firms choose not to expand internationally for several reasons. The most common of these is the reluctance to go beyond the domestic market of their homeland (Paul & Mas, 2019). This suggests either an unwillingness to face the risks of globalization or an initial calculation of opportunities, taking into account only the company’s home market factors. Moreover, an important reason for the rejection of globalization may be the awareness of problems faced with a foreign market, its characteristics, and potential consumers’ culture, religion, and customs. Thus, the global strategy has its colossal advantages and disadvantages that can push the company away from this approach.",
    "Gnomial Functions Inc. wants to determine the most reliable forecasting technique for determining the sales level for the next eighteen months. The sales trend reflected a consistent increase over the last 18 months with minimal seasonal variation. However, the sales for recent months reflected had more significance on the following months sales (Wisniewski, 2016). Consequently, Gnomial Functions Inc. should use the weighted moving average to forecast the most likely level of sales. The weighted moving average used four weights to determine the likely level of sales in the next month. These weights ranged from 0.1 to 0.4 for the earliest and most recent months respectively. The most recent data received a higher weight due to its higher relevance to the future level of sales. Consequently, the weighted moving average generates accurate forecast compared to the simple moving averages. The company can realize even more accurate forecast by adjusting the weights for the moving average. The management should give higher weight to the recent monthly sales to reduce the forecasting error. Specifically, the mean absolute deviation and mean standard error for the initial weights (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4) was 6.27 and 47.29. In contrast, when the new weights that give more importance to the recent performance (0, 0, 0.4, and 0.6) are applied, the mean absolute deviation declined to 4.81, and the mean standard error declines to 27.28. This performance is better than the simple moving average. Gnomial Functions Inc. should use the weighted moving average to determine the likely level of sales in the next year. This method is simple, effective, and reliable. In addition, it can be adjusted to reflect the changes in sales trend by adjusting the weights to give the requisite importance to the recent months. Therefore, the company should use weighted moving average to estimate the likely performance in the coming year.",
    "The modern world economy is so diverse and deep that it is very difficult to predict for sure when a crisis will break. Recession is danger, and danger is stress – in such a situation, the brain begins to rely on basic instincts of protection – to run, hide, survive. Crisis intervention is a relatively new discipline, the main task of which is to provide temporary emergency emotional assistance to victims of mental and physical violence (Colford & Cavaiola, 2017). Nowadays, there is a risk of economic decline which can seriously affect the entire population; hence, I would not like to experience recession since it would significantly affect my life. The crisis is a phenomenon that takes a toll primarily on the individuals who work for non-profit organizations. There is an increase in layoffs, which means many people will have live on the state allowance. The inability to find a job is the next cause of the crisis. What is more, the level of poverty will raise making people abandon their homes. Individuals will not be able to afford necessary items as well as paying rent. Hence, I consider a recession as an undesirable event for myself due to its damaging nature. When considering the crisis from a professional point of view, the crisis affects the national economy as a whole, affecting not individual enterprises, but the entire sector of the economy. There is an increase in the cost of credit resources and the difficulty of attracting them. In addition, there is a threat of deterioration of relations with international partner organizations. In general, the crisis is an undesirable phenomenon due to its devastating effects and unpredictable consequences.",
    "The YouTube video published by GP Synergy, “GP Training in Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services,” sends a message that Aboriginal Medical Services play a crucial role within the diverse community. The services are essential for providing culturally sensitive and high-quality care to the target populations, often marginalized and underserved, ensuring they have everything they need to tackle rising health concerns. The comprehensive set of services provided by the medical facilities ensures that the patients from the Aboriginal community have access to affordable and convenient health care. One service can support multiple aspects of clients’ lives. The comprehensive approach toward culturally-sensitive care is especially relevant in addressing the social determinants of health (SHOD), which encompass multiple areas of the population’s health, well-being, and quality of life. SDOH includes safe housing, neighborhoods, convenient transportation, racial discrimination and violence, education, income, job opportunities, access to nutritional foods, low-quality air and water, and language and literacy skills (Healthy People 2030, 2020). Therefore, the Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services aims to address the health disparities and inequities that most Aboriginal patients encounter (Pearson et al., 2020). The professionals working within the Aboriginal Community Health Services framework underline the importance of patient education to ensure that the population is aware of its potential health challenges and knows about the necessity of early prevention and management. The prominent SHOD that is being discussed in the “GP Training in Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services” video is discrimination. The health center workers acknowledge that many of their patients have experienced discrimination in the healthcare system and want to receive culturally-sensitive services (Kim, 2019). Providing such services is challenging because healthcare workers do not know what to expect from each patient and must be prepared to carry out culturally sensitive services (Jongen, McCalman, and Bainbridge, 2018). Care continuity is especially relevant in this case because when patients feel that they are being discriminated against or misunderstood, they are less likely to return to their providers to continue treatment or screening for their core health concerns. Even though implementing culturally sensitive care and addressing the SHOD of discrimination is challenging for providers, it is also highly rewarding. The patients discriminated against want to feel accepted, understood, and cared for. Because of this, the workers of the Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services institutions always prioritize building meaningful relationships with their patients (Luft, 2017). Besides, the professionals have noted that they have taken the role of advocates who support their patients in terms of healthcare services and their acceptance in their immediate community and the larger society. Therefore, the work of Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services professionals entails consistent collaboration between themselves and their patients who feel underserved and misunderstood. To conclude, addressing the social determinants of health that affects the Aboriginal community is a demanding process that requires dedication and focuses on the unique needs of patients coming to a facility to receive culturally-sensitive care. Undoubtedly, the process will take some time because healthcare providers must be well-prepared and well-versed in the social determinants of health affecting their clients.",
    "The cultural effects of Roman dominance over the Greek-speaking regions is a fascinating topic that has attracted great scientific interest, especially in the last couple of years. The impact of the interaction between two cultures varied in time and space and was definitely more prominent in places where Roman communities had emerged. These communities served as the so-called influence vectors, and their long residing alongside Greeks resulted in the transmission of Roman elements into public life. One of such elements was Roman names, the dissemination of which may be explained by the existence of networks of exchange and the sense of identity of name bearers. Rizakis (2019) notes that the introduction of the Greeks to the Roman system of naming with its further adaptation to their norms and the Roman names adoption by peregrine Greeks are two different phenomena. However, they both are examples of the interaction process between the two traditions, which gradually led to the appearance of a common onomastic culture. This acculturation form, increased in the 2 nd century AD, showed wide regional variability, and the reception of it was different in different cities and social classes. These cultural transfers were mostly mediated by civic elites, as their purpose was to pass on their influence by name – both in a regional context and more broadly, on a system level. Tria nomina, in particular, and its use in the imperial period especially, as stated by Rizakis (2019), was a source of pride, power, and prestige. Due to this, some names became popular as expressions of the shared culture and were accepted and adopted, albeit on a small scale, by the lower classes as well, having lost their original meaning. However, the dominance of Roman names as the distinguishing signs of the Empire’s free citizens took place for a short amount of time. As per Rizakis (2019), by the end of the 3 rd century AD, a new way of identity expression appeared – a single naming system using separate Greek and Roman names. At first it was used sparingly but after the reign of Constantine – and especially during the period of late antiquity – it started being employed in almost all Roman provinces. This change, advanced by Christianity’s progress and the Roman Empire’s decline, might be deemed as a return to the Greek naming tradition.",
    "Health promoters are a trained workforce whose primary purpose is to improve health through a variety of activities carried out by health promotion organizations. Individual empowerment, societal responsibility for health, and establishing an enabling environment for developing personal skills and boosting community action are among their top goals (Nutbeam, 2019). In the realm of health promotion, experts from various multidisciplinary health workers have agreed on the characteristics of effective collaboration and an interdisciplinary approach. Interdisciplinary teams’ most essential purpose is to bring together a variety of diverse viewpoints on caring and to use the talents and knowledge of many different individuals and sectors. Intersectional collaboration between different health professionals and the public and commercial sectors is critical for effective health promotion (US Department of Health and Human Services, 2018). The diversity of these elements demonstrates that one’s health is not just dependent on medical services or nurses and physicians (Nutbeam, 2019). The large range of activities that make up health promotion needs a diverse set of abilities from a number of health professionals and industries. Incorporating multidisciplinary specialists within the health promotion team, such as Nurse Practitioners (NPs), Social Workers (SWs), and Registered Nurses (RNs), will be advantageous in the long and short term. Nurse practitioners are nurses who receive further education and training and are capable of treating a wide range of ailments as well as providing preventative care and health education (Pun, 2018). Social workers have specialized training in assisting people and groups in developing skills and resolving difficulties. Whether the issues are personal, interpersonal, or social in nature, social workers can assist in guiding and resolving many of today’s issues (Nutbeam, 2019). Registered nurses examine and analyze healthcare needs in order to decide the best service or treatment, the best healthcare provider, and the best equipment to deliver patient care (Pun, 2018). Thus, their skills and approach will be essential in the success of an interdisciplinary team tasked with health promotion.",
    "Like many other areas of life, music has changed along with society. The period between 1959 and 1963 was transitional, and at least two distinct markets emerged in the music industry (Covach and Flory 112). The first one was defined by the new generation of teenagers who favored dance music (Covach and Flory 113). The second market consisted of former rock and rollers who preferred folk music associated with social, political, and economic issues (Covach and Flory 113). Folk had a long history of addressing problems within American society, and its music appeared to be more dedicated to the community than commercial pop (Covach and Flory 118-119). Folk performers appealed to the audience and represented people rather than being above them (Covach and Flory 119). Almost anyone could play folk, as the music was simple and required a few easy guitar accords (Covach and Flory 119). Thus, the idea spread of folk being “for the people and by the people” (Covach and Flory 119-120). The concept was related to the music and the people’s ideologies, as the singers and the audience, united by social issues, expressed their concerns through songs. As folk was the music of people, it was also a movement characterized by many important figures. The Weavers consisted of traditional performers such as Peete Seeger and were one of the most significant folk groups in the US (Covach and Flory 119). The Weavers focused on societal problems and prioritized the simplicity of the music, gaining an audience among college students (Covach and Flory 119). At the beginning of the 1960s, The Kingston Trio was the most popular group that started the folk revival in the mainstream pop market (Covach and Flory 119-120). The Kingston Trio’s pop-sensitive approach was favored by the public and defined folk music for many general listeners (Covach and Flory 120-121). Considerable singers have represented folk music, supporting the movement of addressing issues within society.",
    "The Roman Empire was largely polytheistic, suggesting that people acknowledged and honored several different gods. They thought that these entities had a part in the formation of Roman civilization and shaped the events of people’s everyday lives (Bartsch, 2020). Because of Rome’s geographical location, its population had regular interaction with Greek peoples who had expanded their territory into the Italian peninsula and Sicily (Beard, 2015). Many features of Greek culture were borrowed by Rome, with minor modifications to fit their requirements. According to Polybius ‘ interpretation of the Roman government, the monarchy was solidified in the office of the Consul. The tales of Manilus Hippomanes, Olivier de Noyen, and Julien Barneuve are connected through history in The Dream of Scipio by a philosophical musing claiming that man is accountable for his action’s own redemption, but only by understanding, not by works or faith (Ruden, 2013). Rome had two chancellors, each in control of divisions of the Roman army and had the authority to convene conferences and present different initiatives before the Senate; they were acclaimed yearly. Citizenship in Rome was a complicated notion that differed depending on one’s gender, family, and status in society. Males were the only ones who could acquire full citizenship. A kid born of a legal union between a citizen father and a citizen mother would be granted citizenship by descent (Beard, 2015). Citizenship in the United States can be obtained by birth or registration. People are generally born U.S. citizens if they are born in America or are born overseas to U.S. citizens. They may also obtain U.S. nationality as a youngster as a result of the marriage of one or both adults.",
    "A proposed financial plan to support Mental Health Services for Healthcare Providers of Critical Patients: Category Subcategory Expenditures ($) Staff Mental Health Service Manager 400,000 Personal Consultants 840,000 Group Consultants 650,000 Technical Support Staff 180,000 Equipment Personal Laptops 12,000 Personal Mobile Phones 5,000 Services Telephone Service 2,400 Internet Service 300 Supplies Administrative Supplies 500 Medication 1,500 Training Employee Training 2,000 Managerial Training 2,000 Maintenance Offices Maintenance 3,000 Laptops and Mobile Phones Maintenance 1,500 Other Expenditures Unforeseen Expenditures 5,000 The impact of a biblical stewardship perspective on the proposed financial plan The biblical perspective on stewardship presumes that leaders are granted control over other people and resources by God (Carradus, Zozimo, & Discua Cruz, 2020). Thus, they should strive to ensure the well-being of every person in order to honor the Lord. In this regard, the current financial plan was designed in a manner that would benefit all the stakeholders involved, including healthcare providers of critical patients and consulting staff. The potential holes and unknowns in the project’s financial plan Although the financial plan seemingly addresses most of the expenses that may occur during the project realization, there are still some unknowns that should be considered. As such, O’Connell (2020) argues that managers should always think about the worst-case scenario and be prepared to respond adequately. In the case of the current project, first of all, it is hard to predict the real demand for mental health services among doctors. This, in turn, negatively affects the ability to predict the required number of mental health workers. Secondly, potential crises and resulting inflation rates may cause a price increase, which, in turn, would necessitate additional money to purchase equipment and medication. Moreover, the costs for the services, training, and maintenance may also surge. Assumptions that can fill the potential holes in the project’s financial plan As for the former hole in the financial plan, it can be assumed that there will be an average demand for mental services among healthcare professionals. This assumption would help to partly mitigate the risks of the unknown need for offered services. It is explained by the fact that when the expected demand is low but the actual necessity is high, then the patients are largely underserved. On the contrary, when expectations are high, but the actual demand is low, it leads to substantial financial losses. As for inflation, it is necessary to assume a certain amount of money for unforeseen expenditures. Therefore, if the prices rise, the organization will still be able to pay for the planned expenses.",
    "In the article “The influence of peers during adolescence: Does homophobic name-calling by peers change gender identity?” the authors claim that negative name-calling among peers can lead to a change in gender identity. Firstly, this is because negative experiences with peers of the same sex result in the need to identify with peers of the opposite sex. Secondly, during the period of growing up, the adolescents’ identity is not yet fully established. Therefore, they are constantly re-evaluating whether the identity formation is going in the right direction. DeLay et al. (2018) recognize that homophobia can be directed at homosexual and heterosexual adolescents. This is presumably because the purpose of victimization is to hurt someone’s feelings, not point out real flaws. Gender identity development is a critical stage in developing a personality occurring during adolescence (DeLay et al., 2018). Since homophobic name-calling is a form of victimization, this practice should be frowned upon or banned in schools. Ioverno et al. (2021) note that “bullying GNCV may represent a defensive reaction to demonstrate bullies’ gender conformity” (p. 215). Therefore, work with bullies should be carried out competently and with the participation of a psychologist. Interestingly, Ioverno et al. (2021) highlight how this statement is especially true for male bullies. That is because their “own gender conformity can affect the selection of victims based on their gender conformity” (p. 216). It is critical to understand this mirror interaction to resolve the issues of gender victimization. Equally important, victimization of adolescents, including LGB, trans, and heterosexual high school students may lead to “anxiety, depression, and substance use disorders, especially among sexual and gender minority youth” (Valido et al., p. 602). This is another valuable observation that indicates the need for concomitant prevention practices of substance abuse among adolescents. No less important, substance abuse should be perceived as the consequence of psychological problems.",
    "The first mention of a homosexual act is found in the Old Testament Book of Leviticus. And it is said there about this in a prohibitive manner: “Do not lie down with a man as with a woman: this is an abomination.” (Leviticus 18:22) The Apostle Paul says the following: “Just as men, having rejected natural intercourse with women, burn with lust for one another: men do shameful deeds with men, preparing for themselves the retribution that they deserve, having gone astray.” (Rom 1:27) First of all, when talking about homosexuality – the scriptures talk about “intercourse” or “lust,” but not about orientation in the sense that homosexual people today have in mind – an equal love relationship between two partners of the same sex. Homosexual relationships have been shared at all times and in all societies. However, the idea of ​​”orientation” as a property inherent in a particular person is relatively new; it appears only towards the end of the 19th century, making it difficult to directly compare the phenomenon of homosexuality in the context of Christianity (Kuefler 1256). The second important point is comparing religious books of homosexual relationships with a relationship with women. Homosexuality existed in the ancient world and the Middle Ages – but it was never understood as an equal union. In the Christian world, the execution was supposed to be for sodomites. In England, sodomites were executed until the New Times; for a long time, homosexuals were one of the targets of the Inquisition. The Code of Justinian in Byzantium provided severe punishments for them: up to castration and the death penalty. Given the high religiosity in the authorities, such persecution was supported by religious overtones. However, there was no equal modern understanding of the union, even at the level of a philosophical idea: such events were a deviation from the norm and were not perceived fundamentally.",
    "The framers of the Constitution did not believe that citizens would take an active part in the political life of the country. While many freedoms were incorporated in the Constitution, its framers doubted whether people were interested enough in politics to follow its makings. It is true that in those times, information was limited; however, nowadays, mass media help people to be well-informed about political events. Moreover, the media act as a watchdog on the governmental powers (How Does the Media Affect Politics). Informational agencies report the events and let readers make their minds about them or share their views (How Does the Media Affect Politics). However, it always pays not to rely on the media too much and take pains to follow the political life of the country. They felt that everyday citizens were uninformed and did not care what was going on in our government. I disagree that citizens are uninformed and do not care about political life. Nowadays, there are many organizations that promote civil rights and freedoms closely following the events on the political landscape of the country. People do not wait for a crisis to voice their opinions; on the contrary, citizens try to stay well-informed about what is going on (Jach & Trolian, 2022). The media, as a great source of information, facilitates this task, allowing people to have access to the latest events all over the world (Greenberg & Page, 2015). Crises as such make people more interested in politics, but there are many people who take pains to voice their opinions, notwithstanding the political or economic situation. These people deserve great respect as they act as watchdogs on the wide judicial, legislative, and executive powers vested in our politicians and judges by the laws we have adopted as a nation.",
    "Olivier Armantier’s et al. article, “How Economic Crises Affect Inflation Beliefs: Evidence from the COVID-19 Pandemic,” was published in the Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization on July 24, 2021. Publisher Elsevier has partnered with the Copyright Center RightsLink service to offer various options for reusing this content. Elsevier offers open or restricted access to content with permanently unique identifiers to include links and citations. This paper is an independent article focusing on the state of the public economy during COVID-19. In their paper, the authors examine changes in the perception of inflation during the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although this paper is an independent work, Armantier et al. (2021) complemented other research in the field analyzing economic changes during the COVID-19 recession. A feature of the article is the study by the authors of the consequences of inflationary crises and comparison with pre-existing crises to calculate the level of the crisis as a whole. The survey’s main purpose is to collect against a wide range of economic outcomes. As a result of their research, the authors studied the evolution of households’ perceptions of inflation and concluded that the growth of inflationary expectations was more restrained. It means that the muted reaction of average inflation expectations masks a significant polarization of views, especially in the short term (Bekaert et al., 2020). A significant proportion of households, particularly those with higher education, initially expected that the pandemic would lead to low inflation or even deflation (Armantier et al., 2021). Thus, the authors achieved their goal and confirmed their results with numerous graphs and tables presented in the article. I liked the study by Armantier et al. (2021) because the authors look at non-traditionally triggered crises and household responses. In addition, through comparative analysis with past crises, Armantier et al. (2021) determine the spread of the crisis due to erroneous assumptions about inflation to other areas of the economy (Armantier et al., 2021). For example, the Great Recession was predominantly a strong negative demand shock driven by a falling house and stock prices. I also liked that the authors found evidence for strong polarization of inflation perceptions and identified differences between demographic groups.",
    "With the widespread use of digital technology, email has gained particular importance. With email, communication has become much easier, as people have been able to communicate with colleagues, relatives, loved ones, and business partners and representatives of organizations, literally in real-time, avoiding all the difficulties of “physical” communication. However, what is interesting is a study of the extent to which such communication has been modified with the advent of the phenomenon of email. In the context of interpersonal communication, two effects should be highlighted. First, email has meaningfully broadened the scope of communication so that communication is no longer only realized in the real world but can easily be continued online as well. This has changed the perception of interpersonal communication and greatly simplified the availability of communication. Meanwhile, email has changed the perception of nonverbal communication through emotions and body language, since in text correspondence, especially of a business nature, such expressions of speech do not make sense (Smith, n.d.). Of course, there are alternatives in the form of emoji and stickers, but in emails, as a rule, such forms are rarely used, unlike in messengers. From these features, an essential advantage of email is highlighted, namely increased accessibility, the possibility of virtually limitless communication, and staying connected with people at all times. However, there are also disadvantages: dependence on Internet equipment, the need for an electronic device, and any cybersecurity concerns. It is easy to make mistakes in electronic correspondence, as individuals automatically try to extrapolate real-world communication skills to the digital world. These mistakes include ignoring the type of interlocutor and lack of digital etiquette, mixing up writing styles, and sending long, unstructured messages (CNBC, 2018). To avoid making these mistakes in everyday correspondence, it is advisable to learn the rules of electronic etiquette, review your messages before sending, the appropriateness of using slang and style for specific interlocutors and reducing the letter to the minimum size that retains meaning.",
    "Despite numerous calls to concentrate on customer satisfaction or improve work engagement, countless American corporate executives remain obsessed with their companies’ financial growth. Even so, making a profit is the only way the world can tell if a company is doing things correctly. Furthermore, if a company ceases to make money, it may cease operations entirely. Clearly, some businesses lack the financial resources to fully capitalize on available product market growth opportunities. Others do not have opportunities that are commensurate with their financial means. Sources of finance and product-market opportunities influence how quickly a company can grow. To understand how fast a company should grow, a manager must first investigate the relationship between “inflation, capital costs, profitability, growth, and the market value of a company’s common stock” (Fruhan, 2014, para. 4). The profitability of a company depends on two factors: the expected return on equity (ROE) and the cost of capital. If ROE is predicted to surpass the cost of equity capital, more growth will only have a positive impact on the business’s operations and health. On the other hand, if ROE is not expected to exceed the cost of capital, then the company should consider a strategy of rapid negative growth. Insufficient earnings combined with the necessity to do little more than finance inflation-induced revenue growth can be devastating for the firm’s value (Fruhan, 2014). Businesses in this situation should contemplate a rapid slowing growth program if they are unable to increase revenue. However, in order to maintain properly set growth, a company must meet inflation expectations and even surpass the inflation rate. For example, if an inflation rate is 10%, the company must not only maintain its earnings to beat the inflation rate but try to achieve higher results. According to the statistics provided by Dow Jones, between 1965 and 1981, the inflation rate increased dramatically each year (Fruhan, 2014). Therefore, while Treasury bonds yield about 11%, overall long-term inflation expectations equal 10% (Fruhan, 2014). This means that companies must grow fast enough to keep the cost of equity capital for common stock at 19–20%. Hence, a business should grow according to the inflation rate and other indicators. This way, in order to remain lucrative to investors, an organization needs to beware of a long-term inflation rate. While Treasury bonds are predicted to yield 10% annually, companies need to provide a premium of 9–10%, which in the end equals 19–20% growth. If a company cannot meet the expectations of investors and surpass the inflation rate, it is doomed. Moreover, a company needs to check its ROE and the cost of equity capital. When the former surpasses the latter, a company will be able to create ample growth. When a business fails to oversee these two points and grows more rapidly than it can manage, it can do more harm to its financial health.",
    "The chapter in question tells the story of how global trade has enriched and changed cultures. During the analyzed period, many wealthy rulers and merchants began to demonstrate their power by acquiring exotic works of art. Ideas and books circulated, and cultural exchange was extremely active. People became more tolerant of diversity and more aware of how diverse the world around them was. Ties between different cultures were strengthened because of the continuing strong globalization. European influence had spread so far that the norms and habits of people from the West were beginning to be considered universal and objective (Adelman et al., 2021, p. 597). The key term of the era becomes the Enlightenment, marking a period of triumph of human reason. People begin to think that they can understand the laws of nature and human behavior. The importance of the chapter lies in its multifaceted analysis of the period, taking into account the contribution of each continent. Among the major events, the book describes is how the three great powers formed a group in West and South Asia. The author describes how the rulers of the Ottoman, Safavid, and Mughal dynasties contributed to the cultural development of their countries. The development of China, Japan, the two Americas, the slave states of Africa, and the development of Australia are also narrated. Particular emphasis is placed on how the interaction and mutual influence of different cultures contributed to their overall development. The sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries saw a global cultural renaissance brought on by the growth of new wealth (Adelman et al., 2021, p. 595). There was an increase in the consumption of books, and a greater number of previously unseen monuments were formed (Adelman et al., 2021, p. 595). The world has become highly integrated due to the spread of international trade. However, not all countries were willing to change and only agreed to adapt to the new norms. The Islamic and Chinese worlds generally maintained their identities, but America and Oceania could not resist European cultural pressure.",
    "Summary Today opioids are the most commonly used drug in the United States. For a long time, opiates have been used as effective pain relievers, but their relaxing effects started making people abuse them recreationally. Opioids cause a strong feeling of euphoria, which leads to the risk of using recreational substances. Addicted people have a constant desire to increase the dose, which is a severe medical and social problem. The United States is facing one of the worst drug crises in history. More than half of deaths are associated with prescription opioids: heroin and fentanyl (Coon et al., 2022). The number has risen nationwide amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The crisis has acquired enormous proportions and become a brake on the economy and a threat to national security. Forms of Treatment Available to those Suffering from Opioid Addiction The most effective way to overcome opioid addiction is recognized as “substitution therapy”. This approach involves using a drug with less addictive potential as a legal alternative to heroin and other highly addictive drugs. Three substances are currently approved for substitution therapy: methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone (Volkow et al., 2014). Medications are determined with cautiousness to avoid unwanted psychoactive effects. For example, a significant disadvantage of methadone is its ability to provoke a strong withdrawal syndrome in case of discontinuation of its use. To alleviate the patient’s condition, doctors can resort to additional help with tranquilizers, antidepressants, antipsychotics, and non-opioid analgesics. In addition, doctors widely use symptomatic treatment and supportive therapy (Volkow et al., 2014). In the severe phase of withdrawal, the patient should be under constant medical supervision. Helping a Friend or a Family Member with an Opioid Addiction The most important aspect of the treatment motivation is the family. It is necessary to help a person acquire a sincere desire to battle for life. Rehab centers remain an effective chance for an addicted person to return to a healthy, drug-free life. It uses a unique rehabilitation program that allows one not only to overcome addiction but to return to a healthy lifestyle and realize its value (Brown, 2018). To provide effective motivation, the psychiatrist should learn all the necessary data about the addicted person. It will require the assistance of relatives and friends who can tell about the psychological atmosphere, patients’ habits, interests, and family relationships.",
    "Social responsibility entails policies that organizations put in place as part of a company’s governance projected to ensure the corporate’s functions are effective and beneficial to all stakeholders. These guidelines help protect the environment, improve the quality of life for societies, and provide a conducive working environment through recognizing and appreciating talented and hardworking employees. This increases customer loyalty as clients feel they are helping the business support worthy initiatives, thus, enabling more access to funds and allowing more investors to join and support the company. The business rewards employees through meaningful praises, which makes them appreciated. It provides workers a chance to lead by example while giving them the capacity to make decisions without interference, demonstrating that they are trusted and capable (Yang et al., 2019). Additional monetary motivations comprise yearly or semi-yearly bonuses. Additionally, paid time-off and cash prizes help to boost performance while encouraging feelings. The company exercises CSR by adopting a business code of ethics, which shapes workers’ behavior on morals, standards, environment, self-esteem, and customer service. The organization has established dependable systems to protect staff and avoid accidents and injuries (Tamvada, 2020). It also ensures suppliers are aware of and meet the expectations of responsible conduct concerning issues such as affordable costs. For instance, screening dealers to define their past behavior and discuss what the company expects. The only change in CSR that I would suggest is how the organization handles employees’ creativity. I would encourage the company to set a stage for brainstorming, thus, encouraging new ideas and creativity (Tamvada, 2020). Regarding complaints about the company engagement and expenditures, it is evident that the business is striving to improve CSR, and the further it advances in that direction, the more it benefits. For instance, experiencing more brand recognition means increases in sales. Nestle has endeavored to become a socially responsible and environmentally sustainable corporation. Thus, it qualifies for a pass because of its tremendous achievement in empowering communities. It has improved people’s living standards, creating access to hygiene and clean water and motivating populations to live healthy lifestyles. I would recommend the company implement an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process (Tamvada, 2020). ERM should be applied since it is designed to find possible events that can affect the business. This will also help manage risks and opportunities and develop meaningful assurance concerning company objectives.",
    "The secret of IKEA’s success on the global market lies in its perfect execution of all components of the marketing mix. The company has adapted its strategy to each market with precision, flexibility, and creativity that made its products highly recognized. The ingenuity of its marketing mix proposal can serve as an example for other companies in Europe and worldwide. In this paper, the four components of IKEA’s marketing mix will be discussed. This Swedish company has gained renown for the quality, accessibility, and innovativeness of its products. First of all, the firm’s pricing strategy is focused on affordability, as the structure and logistics of its stores are optimized for a maximum price reduction (O’Neill, 2021). Promotions of this store chain are widespread through all communication channels, ranging from local radio stations to social media accounts made for each region individually. IKEA stays on top of modern advertising strategies and employs influencers to reach younger audiences (O’Neill, 2021). Regarding its locations, IKEA continuously selects places where it will remain accessible for the public while keeping its prices at the lowest. However, the most notable feature of this company is its products. Its home furniture is easy to recognize for its style, modularity, and reusability (O’Neill, 2021). There is a constant stream of new products in IKEA, giving customers a reason to keep visiting it on a regular basis. In conclusion, IKEA’s marketing mix shows how affordable, stylish, and recognizable products are able to capture customers’ hearts and solidify a company’s success for decades to come. There is a piece of furniture for every need and every customer’s taste, as their modularity enables creativity beyond compare. IKEA’s drive to provide its customers with products they desire gave it an immense competitive advantage in Europe and worldwide.",
    "Neil Foley talks about the role of Mexican Americans in the history of the U.S. in Mexicans in the Making of America. The author gave his view of these events in the first chapter, “The Genesis of Mexican America,” where he presented the history of the appearance of Mexican Americans and the silent conflict between the two countries. The author’s central claim is that the American government created an image of lazy Mexican immigrants who cross the border to murder and sell illicit drugs; this stigmatization affected Mexican Americans, too (Foley 34). However, the truth was that white settlers from the southern states were illegal invaders in Texas in the 1830s because they refused to obey the country’s laws (Imery-Garcia 12). Discrimination against Mexican immigrants and citizens was rooted in the 1846-1848 war and the treaty’s approval, which included Texas and Mexican people living there into the U.S. territory and being denied their rights. It was interesting to learn from this chapter the viewpoint of many people in the United States about Mexico as a country of cruel and uneducated people. Indeed, it points to the erased memory of the Aztec Empire, the abolition of slavery in Mexico much earlier than in the U.S., and the annexation of Texas. The 1846-1848 war between the two countries was an unfair, violent act of the U.S. government towards a weaker neighbor, which suffered economic downfall at that time (Foley 24). The new legislation after the war gave people the choice of returning to Mexico or becoming U.S. citizens with formally equal rights that were not respected in reality (Gutiérrez 5). Therefore, most of them wanted to be viewed as Spanish Americans rather than people of Mexican descent to avoid stigmatization. I agree with the author’s final point that this historical event created not only a political border between two neighbors but caused subsequent misunderstandings in the relationships between the two nations. In summary, the first chapter in Foley’s Mexicans in the Making of America talks about the origin of Mexican Americans. Specifically, it analyzed the role of the war between Mexico and the U.S. for Texas’s territory in the future political climate between these countries. Overall, the annexation of Texas damaged the relations between them, resulting in the negative perception of Mexican immigrant workers and the desire of Mexican Americans to hide their ancestry.",
    "When many people have a chance to interact simultaneously, especially in learning settings, it may easily lead to the occurrence of conflicts and arguments. The talkative or negative members undoubtedly impact the atmosphere within the team (Jacobs et al., 2016). It seems that “the show-off” might negatively influence the moods of all the members, considering that it is easy to get irritated by such a type of behavior (Jacobs et al., 2016). In addition, show-offs’ aim is to impress people around them, especially a group leader, and to do so, they usually opt for talking without a stop or boasting, which distracts other members. It is a common issue in group settings as such members desire to attract attention to themselves as they might be insecure or not confident in themselves. That is why the show-offs tend to answer all the questions, even those that are not directed at them. Moreover, they can attract a leader’s attention by asking irrelevant or off-topic questions. As a matter of fact, non-stop talking may be an obstacle for reaching a productive learning atmosphere as, eventually, people will be irritated and not have acquired any helpful knowledge during the lesson. The constant involvement of the show-offs in the educational process is likely to annoy other members so that they will develop hatred for such type of behavior (Forsyth, 2019). Furthermore, the show-offs can easily prevent the group from reaching the set aim by distracting them through their foolery and over-involvement in the whole process. Overall, such members can harm the group’s productivity and effectiveness in learning as they opt for attracting all the attention to themselves without giving other individuals opportunities to realize their potentials within the settings.",
    "The airline industry has been hit particularly hard by Covid 19. The virus outbreak has caused the governments of most countries to implement restrictions on traveling (Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Aviation, 2022). Thus, the regulatory implementations have negatively affected the standard revenue, business practices, and practices of airline companies. First, passengers were less keen to travel due to the testing regulations, limited resources, and the lack of need to travel for work. Another cause was the regulation themselves that implied a reduction in Covid-19 cases through quarantine measures. The low demand has caused the airlines to lose revenue ($372 bn), which was an unprecedented change in the industry (Economic impacts of covid-19 on Civil Aviation, 2021). Flights were being canceled, and employees were laid off due to the challenging situation in which the corporations could not sustain airports with such a low passenger rate. The airline companies have experienced major economic challenges that have been facilitated by all the negative implications of the pandemic on civil aviation. As a result, fewer seats were being offered (-50%), and fewer passengers were able to travel via plane (-2,7 bn) (Economic impacts of covid-19 on Civil Aviation, 2021). The effect was slightly balanced out due to the fact that cargo flights have been less impacted or even increased in rates due to the transportation of medical supplies (Nižetić, 2020, p. 10953). However, as vaccines became available and fewer restrictions were put in place, the situation has changed for the better in 2021. More opportunities have occurred due to the less rigid regulatory implementations, vaccination, and other beneficial factors. As exemplified in the relevant literature, the lost revenue in 2021 was slightly lower ($324 Bn). Even though these figures look dismal, the year 2021 has seen a slight improvement, with the years to come sure to be better and better.",
    "The researchers base their conclusion on three well-designed case studies touching on various software applications. The case studies include evaluating bone fractures following traffic accidents, bone injuries caused by a spade, and gunshot wounds on the head, which offer valuable data on enhancing contemporary forensic investigations (Buck et al., 2008). The modeling software and haptic device used for the study boast high precision, low friction, superior fidelity, and output capacity of six degrees of freedom. In the present world, these are top-notch specifications for such discourses. However, replicating the study to verify the findings may prove a challenge due to the high cost of assembling all the specimens and equipment utilized therein (Pinzon et al., 2016). The researchers do well to draw their interpretations and conclusions from the gathered data involving the three separate case studies cited above. The results of the studies indicate that haptic devices can prove very valuable in post-mortem and forensic investigations. In forensic science, the research can be instrumental in enabling investigators to recreate a crime scene (such as gun-holding position) and identify the object used in the crime with enhanced precision and speed. Hagmann et al. (2021) thus note that the use of haptics in forensic science can hasten the criminal justice process and make investigations more reliable. The research is highly innovative as it facilitates the use of technology to recreate crime scenes and enables the user to get the sense of touch often lost during such virtual excursions. Thus, the user can handle and feel 3D digital information, which is significant innovation and improves current technologies. According to Joukal et al. (2015), there may arise controversies surrounding the use of haptics due to fears of corrupting operating systems and online hacking to manipulate investigation findings. Such possibilities may impact the reliability of such devices in criminal justice proceedings. In terms of ethics, the machines make investigations much more expensive to conduct due to costly equipment and training for personnel involved (Fahrni et al., 2019). The costs may hinder the quest for justice in some cases, primarily in low-income areas. Nevertheless, the innovation is evident, and the researchers do well to draw solid conclusions based on their three well-designed case studies.",
    "The origins of slavery in the American territories and why it came to be From 1526 until 1776, complex pressures shaped the structure of slavery in the United States, and historians have proposed multiple ideas to explain how slave trade evolved. Slavery was strongly related to labor demand in European colonies, particularly in the Caribbean and South America’s labor-intensive sugar plantation industries of Great Britain, Spain, France, and the Dutch Republic. Slave ships transported captives from Africa to the West and indigenous peoples were enslaved in North American colonies on a smaller scale (OpenStax, 2019). However, Indian slavery effectively stopped in the late eighteenth century. How slavery was handled differently in each colonial territory of British North America Enslaved people worked in various sectors, including breweries, shipyards, plantations, and timber yards. In the regions north of Maryland, slavery would gradually give way to free labor. The slave population in the North progressively fell throughout the 1760s and 1770s with slaves in Philadelphia reducing to approximately 700 in 1775 (OpenStax, 2019). Antislavery activism was rife in the city, with nationalist pamphleteers handing out antislavery booklets to blacks and whites. The presence of antislavery groups facilitated the spread of manumissions thus slavery became less viable in the North. New York had a high percentage of slaves who acquired valuable trades such as masonry and goldsmithing working alongside artisan masters. All slaves in New York were freed in 1827 (OpenStax, 2019) despite the liberation sentiment in the North during the Revolutionary battle. The contrasts between indentured servants and slaves Indentured service varied from enslavement in that it was a type of debt servitude where an agreed-upon period of unpaid service that often covered the servant’s costs of immigration to America. Indentured workers were not awarded incomes, although they were housed, clothed, and nourished in most cases. Slaves were deemed property and were only awarded freedom on rare occasions despite several years of strenuous labor (Gabor, 2021). Slaves were sold, exchanged, negotiated for, and even utilized as property in a will.",
    "The issue of tribal sovereignty has been scrutinized over the years, the treatment of tribes ranging from supportive measures and attempts of integration into the broader community to outright persecution. In this connection, the law about tribal gaming can be seen as a positive step towards recognition of tribes’ unique way of life and self-determination. This essay discusses the question “how tribal gaming act can add to the sovereignty of tribes?” Under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, tribes were given the right to determine what gaming activities they wanted to engage in, and in most cases, the permission was granted by the state. Gaming activities could embrace tribal rituals or games of chance, depending on the wishes of the tribes and had to be agreed to by the state (Light and Rand). Since often tribal games are unique and have a deep meaning for the tribe, it would be right to say that granting tribes the right to hold their own games is necessary. This measure helps to uphold their culture and establish sovereignty over a very important sphere of life, which is relaxation. Moreover, gaming helps to support traditions and customs through rituals that have been molded over the centuries. As far as sovereignty is concerned, gaming serves to establish the spheres of life which are completely under the tribes’ jurisdiction. Thus, for example, some tribe members mix with the society at large, finding employment or integrating themselves in the life of big cities. However, gaming, and in particular traditional tribal gaming, serves as a reminder of one’s roots, promotes freedom of choice and sovereignty as it is the one thing that is almost completely under the tribes’ jurisdiction.",
    "Individual freedoms and national security are sometimes seen as two opposites. However, in ideal, national security should reflect the balanced relationship between the two mentioned concepts. Moreover, the principle of the prevalence of individual freedoms over the national security underlies the democratic idea. Individual freedoms include individual rights and are protected by the US Constitution (Longley). This paper argues that individual freedoms should never be sacrificed in the name of national security. This essay proposes that the protection of individual freedoms by maintaining national security is a fundamental principle and goal of democracy. US President Joe Biden notes, “I strongly believe that democracy is the key to freedom, prosperity, peace, and dignity” (Biden 3). Unlike authoritarian or totalitarian systems, a democratic system puts individual freedoms ahead of national security interests. The implementation of this principle always raises controversy, since there is no single rule universal for all cases. However, individual freedoms are protected in most areas of social life, including migration, cyber security, economic stability, and international diplomatic relations. Interestingly, actual cyber security policy and practice take both human-centric and national-security-centric approaches (Deibert 411). In this regard, the states develop “indivisible network security on a planetary scale for the widest possible coverage of the human experience” (Deibert 412). The above example indicates the breadth of possibilities for applying the principle. There is probably a counter-argument against the opinion that national security interests should take precedence over individual freedoms. This position can be justified by an external threat or military ambitions and is usually applied by authoritarian regimes. This position is wrong since national security should protect the interest of every citizen, not the abstract idea of the nation. Every citizen is part of the nation and their freedoms should be sacred. Thus, it was discussed, how individual freedoms should never be sacrificed in the name of national security. The necessity to sacrifice individual freedoms is usually promoted by authoritarian regimes whose real purpose is to meet the interests of the regime. On the contrary, in democratic states, individual freedoms are fundamental and cannot be violated under any circumstances. These freedoms are sacred and ensure the integrity of the democratic states.",
    "Elements Diamonds by Rihanna was first heard on Elvis Duran Show on September 26, 2012, availed for online download an hour after being released to the public, and was released as the album’s lead single the following day. Sia wrote the song for Rihanna, who holds the song’s copyrights and worked on it a year prior; therefore, the song is owned by an independent contractor (Anggraini 12). Unapologetic is Barbadian artist Rihanna’s seventh studio album, and the song “Diamonds” appears on it (Anggraini 7). Using Sia’s demo vocals as a guide, Rihanna imitated her inflections to the precise tiniest detail. It was only after Benny Blanco heard the finished track to the Australian songwriter did, she realize the vocals belonged to her alone. Inspiration In Diamonds , Rihanna contemplated the existence of both love and diamonds: “Yellow diamonds in the light. To make things even more awkward, we’re standing next to each other. You cross my path as your shadow does.” The diamonds in the song symbolize a silver lining that illustrates the chance for a better future and happier days among dark and depressing days. The song made me think about all the possibilities available when things do not turn out to be as I expected. I also chose the song because its presentation, which was both positive and hopeful, and I am always in a good mood when I listen to it. It is also quite inspirational because it encourages listeners to love themselves. Since its launch, the song has won multiple awards and has enjoyed massive success for years. For Rihanna’s career, the song gave a great boost because it was quite catchy and everyone could recognize it from the very first minutes of it playing.",
    "Different circumstances under which medical staff has worked led to varying types of leadership strategies being developed. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the role of clear communication and the handling of prompt preparation in top healthcare leaders (Nicola et al., 2020). Another key tactic includes the use of external change agents that ultimately promote excellent organizational decision-making (Alagoz et al., 2018). Moreover, one study explained how implementing positivity-related and open-minded approaches as leaders can improve their employee’s resilience, providing an additional source of motivation (Wei et al., 2018). Hence, effective healthcare leaders must adapt to various external changes and strategically communicate with their coworkers. Several departments can be interacted with through the role of a healthcare administrator. One of them includes the in-patient department where multiple approaches from skilled professionals are needed. Moreover, critical care and A&E require excellent management and collaborating opportunities. As already mentioned, the selected healthcare areas are prime examples of fields requiring strong leaders to provide optimal patient care. One way this can be improved to obtain the desired outcomes is through a holistic approach that considers external and internal factors. Furthermore, collective decision-making should not be viewed as limiting to effective leadership; on the contrary, it presents an ideal strategy in healthcare management. The importance of interprofessional collaboration in medical institutions is evident through its effect on patient outcomes. Research has demonstrated significant changes in healthcare conditions after the implementation of the strategy (Spaulding et al., 2018). The method involves acquiring knowledge from colleagues and incorporating it into one’s practice, seeking advice from the respective medical staff. Therefore, the strategy impacts the range of services professionals can offer to their patients and should be worked on further to improve its practicality.",
    "Net Present Value (NPV) reflects the amount of cash an investor or funder expects to receive from a project after inflows are recouped through all sorts of costs. This figure can be understood as the investor’s total profit generated once the payback begins. NPV gives a clear indication of whether a project is worth investing in based on likely costs and potential risk. NVP has many more advantages over other investment criteria. The rules that apply to NVP include common sense and the reasonableness of the investment and take into account return criteria. Since the calculation of NVP involves a time horizon, it is already profitable over static measures. Accordingly, the first advantage of NVP is its connection to the idea of an expected value, which will be less than at the time of investment. Unlike the payback period, NVP recognizes that the value of a currency is temporary and subject to change, so it lays this metric into the calculation of discount rates. Assumptions about the cost of capital allow the NVP to be calculated and suggest a strategy for profitable ways to implement the project. Consequently, the second advantage of this criterion is flexibility and additivity, that is, understanding the benefits of all available projects or one specific one. A third advantage may be that the calculation of NVP considers the size of the investment. This means that NVP is a unidimensional criterion that allows us to estimate the degree of probability of wealth creation based on the number of cash flows. Thus, NVP has several advantages over other investment criteria based on its application. First, NVP considers the present value of money, which gives a clear picture of cash transactions. Second, it is flexible and additive, meaning it evaluates the cost of capital and the appropriateness of the investment. Third, NVP is a one-dimensional indicator that considers all, even space investments.",
    "To properly manage business outputs, it is crucial to examine the external environment of the industry in question. The 7-Eleven organization could greatly benefit from implementing the I/O Model of Above-Average Returns, which relies on the examination of the firm’s external conditions. As such, the first stage involves the analysis of the industry and competitor environment, creating a clear picture of the general atmosphere (Hitt et al., 2007). For the 7-Eleven corporation, the competitors are such large-scale convenience stores as Walmart and Target. However, as the overall industry grows and generates a significant amount of revenue, it creates a positive atmosphere for further development. Another factor to consider is the industry’s attractiveness, as it must possess a high potential for the firm to generate above-average returns. In the current age, the convenience store segment is considered exceptionally beneficial for securing above-average returns due to the increasing demand for large-scale product distribution shops (Graves, 2017). The demand for the variety of choices and the improving financial position of American citizens suggest that the industry’s structural characteristics are quite favorable. After that, 7-Eleven would be required to select a strategy that would ensure the provision of above-average returns. A promising approach could be the implementation of the chain store method, where several branches are established across different countries. However, to apply this technique, particular assets and skills are needed (Hitt et al., 2007). The first criterion is the possession of the products and resources necessary to launch an international branch, as the costs of sustaining a new location in a different country can be demanding (Graves, 2017). In addition, the executives must account for the economic environment of the chosen state, meaning that it is vital to be skilled in international trade and branch management. Finally, to implement the selected approach, it is necessary to establish which actions will be performed to achieve the above-average returns. For 7-Eleven, it would be beneficial to use the company’s strengths in this endeavor, namely the existence of other international branches and the successful history of operations in the US (Lee, 2021). By relying on the previously obtained knowledge and integrating global expansion into the organization’s goals, 7-Eleven might perfectly utilize the formulated strategy and earn above-average returns.",
    "The suggested strategies to mitigate the effects of coronavirus in accordance with the example of Iceland could be considered as an interesting approach. This strategy acknowledges its apparent limitations, such as the resilience of the Iceland community, geographical idiosyncrasy. However, currently, this strategy might not be a valid method to address the high margins of infected individuals in NATO countries. It is certainly true that quick response and high testing rates would contribute to the deterrence of the effects imposed by the sudden growth of the number of infected. However, it is similarly meaningful that the population would be willing to undergo such a measure. Moreover, despite the financial support efforts, some countries belonging to the organization might not be able to financially withstand the high amount of testing imposed by the new waves of infection. This fact is especially relevant given that the virus dissemination might emerge across several countries simultaneously. Therefore, a different approach to the problem might be necessary. The Israeli government approached the problem of monitoring the infected with the creative solution of digital epidemiological investigation (Amit et al., 2020). This technology allowed tracking potential contacts of people that were infected and act accordingly (Amit et al., 2020). However, it is arguable that this methodology could address the geographical limitations introduced in the case of Iceland. It would be difficult for NATO countries to strictly monitor all entrances to their borders. Therefore, an analog in the form of digital tracking may solve the problem with the need for strict borders control and provide necessary tools for timely reaction to the new outbreaks. Nevertheless, it would require funds both internal and external in order to build new or reconstruct the existing infrastructure for the stated purposes.",
    "The introduced Canadian perspective on the provisional agenda of the North Atlantic Council seems to cover key points that concern Canadian security. Increased presence in the world peace operations and maintenance of tight relationships with other NATO members, especially remarkable is the smart defense approach that considers the military and economic needs of Canada. Although, it is difficult to judge the extent of the Syrian threat to Canadian interest during the outbreak of coronavirus, which seems to continue even today. Therefore, it would be essential to review the proposed question for a more effective approach to the defense of Canadian interests. Nevertheless, this act protects the interest of both Israel and Canada and will positively impact their relationship. Furthermore, it is notable how the Canadian government is willing to cooperate with the withdrawal of troops from Iraq if the official request were to be made. This statement in itself is probably a contribution to the international image of Canadian humanitarianism, but the extent of such image improvement is questionable. The focus on building trading relationships and close ties with other NATO countries could be seen as the most important aspect that Israel might acknowledge. Israel’s national security has experienced decades of varying threats, which included terrorism, missiles, and existential nuclear dangers (Freilich, 2018). However, the former national security strategy (NSS) is non-existent in the country as the first document of NSS was developed in 1953 (Freilich, 2018). Nevertheless, the country is more secure than ever before due to the political and military bonds it forms active trade agreements with various powerful countries such as the USA, China, Russia, Germany, Canada, Poland, and India (Freilich, 2018). Currently, the country exhibits great regional power and is able to prosper due to the seven-decades-old strategy.",
    "The current issue with Nike stems from its corrupt corporate culture, which puts women in a position of weakness. It allows powerful men in charge of the company to abuse and suppresses them, preventing them from reaching the positions they deserve without being harassed or denigrated. There are four potential ways of dealing with a problem: absolving, solving, resolving, and dissolving (Ackoff, 2019). Given the scope and the long-term aims for Nike and society in general, the only acceptable solution would be to dissolve it. The process of dissolution revolves around removing the underlying causes for the problem to exist in the first place. Absolving means ignoring the problem, solving – giving the women that were harmed some sort of compensation without making changes, and resolving – giving them the means to fight back without actively trying to change the toxic culture towards something better (Singh, 2018). Just allowing women to fight back is not enough – Nike should make it so that they do not have to. From an organizational framework perspective, the transformation of Nike’s culture should be done on all levels, from top to bottom. If harassment, cronyism, and corruption are acceptable at the top, there is nothing to stop them from occurring at the bottom levels (Singh, 2018). Therefore, Parker and the rest of Nike’s leadership must implement policies and solutions on all levels. This involves disincentivizing such behavior and ensuring that any potential sources of it are extinguished before they could take root again. The proposed plan of action, thus, is to conduct a massive revision of every individual employee and manager to determine their complicity in the acts that have been perpetrated in Nike for ages. All individuals found complicit should be removed from the company. That includes Mr. Parker and the rest of the board themselves, as they have been benefitting from the system while closing their eyes on it. The new leadership would be the one to implement and install a new culture based on equality, capability, and diversity.",
    "The deep socio-economic divides in American society have impacted the unemployment rates even before the COVID-19 pandemic; however, the virus has exacerbated the issue. There have been two distinct experiences during the pandemic: first, people with graduate education, who kept stable jobs through working remotely; second, those who either lost or got reduced in their jobs with no safety net (Blustein et al., 2020). The key determinants of work availability are power and privilege, unevenly divided across racial, gender, and education lines (Blustein et al., 2020). The national socio-economic gaps lie between those who have a college education and those who do not (Galea & Abdalla, 2020). Within the framework of education access, race and ethnicity represent a major division plane between Americans. The black demographic faces racism in hiring, seeking housing, and everyday life, resulting in systemic marginalization (Galea & Abdalla, 2020). Therefore, the issue of unequal job availability persists, with racial divides being particularly striking recently. Discerning socio-economic groups’ post-pandemic recovery rates from April 2020 paints a clear picture. The divide is demonstrated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (2022): there seems to be an improvement post-pandemic, with the average unemployment rate decreasing from 14.7% in April 2020 to 4% now. However, for the black population, the unemployment rate reached 16.8% in April 2020; later, stalled at 10.9% in October 2020 and then only lowered to 6.9% in January 2022 (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2022). In contrast, the white demographic presents a steady decrease within six months from April 2020; by October 2020, unemployment more than halved from 14.1% to 6.0%. Higher education, stable jobs, and support networks contribute to the higher-than-average unemployment rates for the black demographic (Galea & Abdalla, 2020). This statistic demonstrates the uneven struggle to recover from the pandemic-induced and general unemployment.",
    "Considerable musicians have represented soul music, and James Brown was one of the most prominent. Southern soul became extremely popular towards the end of the 1960s, and Brown had his first success in 1956 (Covach and Flory 218). Initially, Brown worked as a stand-in for Little Richard, and his first record, “Please Please Please,” was quite thriving (Covach and Flory 240-241). Brown used to sing lead vocals, and his early musical style resembled that of the 1950s doo-wop (Covach and Flory 242). However, he began to develop the soul style in 1960 with “Think,” characterized by horns and a driving rhythm section (Covach and Flory 242). In 1964, Brown introduced “Out of Sight,” which represented the hard-driving soul style featured in his later songs towards the 1970s (Covach and Flory 242). James Brown was one of the performers who took control of their music, as he united an aggressive style of vocal and dance performance, production skills, and understanding of business (Covach and Flory 242). Brown’s musical style through the 1960s and into the 1970s changed from following prior era’s themes to creating his unique sounds. As Brown was searching for and evolving his individual style, his career differed from Motown, Stax, or Atlantic artists and led him to produce distinguishable songs. For instance, the stops at the end of the verses in Brown’s “Papa’s Got a Brand New Bag, Pt. 1” distinct the music from a Stax arrangement (Covach and Flory 243). At the same time, the absence of background vocals in the song varies from Motown’s approach (Covach and Flory 243). Moreover, James Brown’s music was highly famous within the Black community, as, unlike Motown and Atlantic artists, Brown expressed apparent racial pride through hard-edged musical style and political lyrics (Covach and Flory 244). Brown acted passionately on his live shows as a singer, dancer, and bandleader but also hired notable musicians and rehearsed them tirelessly (Covach and Flory 240). James Brown was a remarkable performer whose vision of music and societal norms differed from other professionals.",
    "Janina’s language in the novel Drive Your Plow over the Bones of the Dead is unique in many ways, as she unravels the mystery surrounding not only the murders but her personality. However, one of the most notable traits that the reader may notice on the first page is Janina’s use of nicknames as substitutes for any person or animal’s name. While many people use nicknames for friends or people they dislike, Janina’s approach is built on her feelings towards her name and names in general. She states, “I believe each of us sees the other person in our way, so we should give them the name we consider suitable.” She considers names “polyonymous” and adheres to this rule for every character she encounters. As a result, each person that Janina talks with or about is transformed into the characteristic she sees in them. Her friend is Oddball – and from the beginning, the reader has to inherently accept that this person may be strange somehow, although it may not be accurate. Similarly, the murder victims – Big Foot, Commandant, Inner – have to be seen as the traits of appearance or status they have in Janina’s eyes. In contrast, when Janina thinks about a name for a rescue dog, her first idea is a human name, Marysia. She denies other pet names, saying that “considering her personal history” they could not be suitable for the dog. Thus, Janina thinks deeply about the animal’s life and problems, basing the name on the dog’s condition and story. By looking at the contrast between names and nicknames that Janina uses for people and animals, one can see her actual values. She loves animals while humans get judged or excluded for their oddity. Therefore, while the narrator is untrustworthy, she quickly gives away her views on the murders and exposes her potential role in them. Her nature is to judge people for their treatment of animals, and the latter is perceived as better, more worthy of saving than humans.",
    "John Smeaton was an English engineer who designed bridges, canals, and lighthouses. In the given article, written by Andrew M. A. Morris, the author demonstrates how this renowned engineer employed parameter variation in a far more broad context as part of an analytical procedure (Morris, 2021). Morris stresses the three distinct goals of such a process, including optimization, theory testing, and maxim development through exploratory testing. As the writer puts it, the fundamental point of this study is that Smeaton accomplished more than enhanced engineering processes by systematizing prior artisanal ways, as was the traditional interpretation of Smeaton’s method established by technology analysts in the 1990s (Morris, 2021). Rather, he claims that his method creates a link between science and technology by including both theory testing and practical testing (Morris, 2021). I agree with the author and believe that John Smeaton was successful at performing the traditionally seen hypothesis testing and developed empirical regularities through exploratory experimentation. While some scholars might claim that no scientific research was involved in the work of Smeaton, the engineer managed to go through a thorough analysis and create his own maxims. Morris also discussed the relationship between science and technology during the Industrial Revolution. According to Morris, the conventional understanding of it was determined by two nearly obsolete historical studies, which are reflected in the discussion between A.E. Musson, and Eric Robinson, and A. Rupert Hall (Morris, 2021). According to the first two researchers, science was an essential aspect of the industrial Era (Morris, 2021). Hall, conversely, believes that the 18th-century technical innovations attributed almost nothing to the era’s science. The way I see it, Hall’s opinion does not have a solid ground. The Industrial Revolution, in my perspective, was an amalgam of technology, science, and industry. Significant breakthroughs and technical advancements shaped nearly every present field of people’s lives while also introducing a slew of new ones. It is well known that during the early stages of the Revolution, natural forms of energy, such as wind and water, were harnessed to generate electricity. However, later, new technologies, including steam power, were investigated and improved by John Smeaton, and electricity was critical in enabling the Industrial Revolution to flourish.",
    "The percentage of uninsured people in my state, Washington, is among the lowest. Particularly, it was 6.6% as of 2019, which is considerably lower than in Oklahoma (14.9%) or Texas (18.4%) (Kaiser Family Foundation, n.d.). In my opinion, the connection between the socioeconomic status and access to care is evident. The fewer opportunities a person has in terms of financial provision, the less possible it is for them to afford high-quality health care. Individuals with low income are highly likely to be uninsured or eligible for Medicaid. As a result, such citizens do not seek health care as often as it is needed. Frequently, they only address specialists in emergency cases, neglecting many other issues that require prevention or treatment. I think that the main reason why the percentage is low in my state is because of its geographic location. There are many job opportunities in the state of Washington, which means people can afford to pay for health insurance. Also, individuals living in this state are well-informed about their options regarding health needs. Apart from that, the number of healthcare facilities is much higher than, say, in rural areas. All of these factors contribute to the high level of insured people. Speaking about the gap in quality of care and access to health care, I should also note such factors as ethnic disparities, access to education, and community context. In my state, it is easier for people from diverse backgrounds to accommodate and find support. However, there are parts of the country where some ethnic groups might be accepted with prejudice, which makes it difficult for them to pursue high-quality education and find well-paid jobs.",
    "Kantian ethics is the clearest example of non-consequential theories in philosophy, and by extension, in law. Support for the theory often comes from adherents of imperative social order ideas such as utilitarianism. In Kant’s philosophy, the ideas of non-consequential ethics are most clearly demonstrated by the moral and ethical phenomenon he formulated and called the categorical imperative. This concept, as conceived by Kant, is the formulation of how a person should act, striving to partake in genuinely moral behavior (Kant & Abbott, 2021). The imperative directly addresses the acting person, who makes specific moral choices according to the predetermined rational ways. It advises a person to strictly and urgently, most attentively, treat the maxims of their behavior, namely to the subjective rules of practical reason. According to Kant, the principles of pure practical reason have a specific non-consequential form (Kant & Abbott, 2021). They are statements containing a general definition of will, which is subject to many practical rules; this notion has particular problems in the very essence of the statement. It should be discussed how Kant understands ethics in greater detail. Namely, morality should not be relative, bound by private interests, but absolute and universal; otherwise, it does not exist at all (Kant & Abbott, 2021). In other words, relativism is the enemy of genuine morality, the contingency of principles, and adaptation to the situation. In this aspect of Kant’s philosophy, the conflict between the fundamental, strictly necessary, universal moral law, which Kant defends, and the always determined circumstances, the actions of specific people, acquires a particularly sharp form. This conflict arises at the forefront of Kant’s non-consequential ethical position. After all, a specific person cannot live and act otherwise than focusing on circumstances, building their own subjective maxims of behavior. Perhaps they have no reason to be guided by universal morality, and in this case, the universal moral law–the categorical imperative–becomes just an idea and a chimera.",
    "Labor racketeering can be defined as the illegal use of unions and authority for self-interest. Union labor corruption was perpetrated by, performed in collaboration with, or under the direction of organized criminal syndicates. The beginning of the 20th century set the foundation for labor racketeering and became a law and societal concern (Jacobs, 2020). Until the late 1970s and early 1980s, there was no systematic governmental or enforcement agencies effort to mitigate the issue (Jacobs, 2020). During prohibition, criminal groups chose to generate profit from selling illicit spirits, which maintained the alcohol demand and earnings high. When prohibition was abolished in the 1930s, the mafia’s advanced business-running methods remained (Jacobs, 2020). The most potent groups turned their focus away from alcohol to business, including narcotics, gambling, and prostitution (Jacobs, 2020). However, these were not the only money-making businesses that contributed to the profit diversification. Among other beneficial businesses for the organized crime was labor racketeering through the control of labor unions. There are many reasons why gangs prefer labor unions to other kinds of unions. For example, it can be evident from their choice to control the Teamsters and International Longshoremen’s Association (Jacobs, 2020). With the sources of such unions, members of Cosa Nostra could easily access all kinds of legitimate businesses, including waste management, construction, or demolition. Moreover, they had easy access to healthcare and pension funds from the unions. These legitimate businesses offered them ways to not only traffick illicit substances or people but also cover up their actions (Jacobs, 2020). Among other crimes, the organized groups performed extortions or threatened employers, and solicited or received bribes. Hence, it can be seen that organized crime has always tried to control local businesses and expand their influence with the help of diversification of their profits. Among the main activities of gangs were prostitution, drug trafficking, gambling, and labor racketeering. Labor unions were beneficial to organized crime due to the sources they had. Such unions gave mobsters access to legitimate demolition, construction, and waste management businesses.",
    "There are many different scientific approaches to language studies; one of them is the prescriptive method. This principle can generally be described as a set of rules that prescribe speaking or writing. Crystal (1987) notes that prescriptivism is a perspective that chooses one of the interpretations of a language as the standard and extends it to the entire society. This variation is most often found in formal speech and literature. An alternative perspective is a descriptive approach based not on standards but on the actual situation. The proponent of this method simply describes the facts of linguistic variousness (Crystal, 1987). They act as an observer, not constrained by the official framework. Although these methods are opposite in meaning, each of them can be applied in the appropriate context. Crystal (1987) notes that exploring these methods often leads to an unrealistic depiction of the opposite side, the formation of prejudice and confrontation. However, both approaches should exist together, combining the positive aspects of each other. While the prescriptive approach allows the design of society to be arranged, the descriptive approach allows the recording of real language changes (Crystal, 1987). This, in turn, allows combining logic and the natural order of things. However, not all language changes are received positively due to misconceptions. The clearest example is the belief that change means deterioration, as the old generation constantly complains (Crystal, 1987). In addition, language changes are associated with a decline in the quality of education and the negative impact of the media. Nevertheless, the author selects sufficient counterarguments to all these fears. The elders are always resentful of change, as evidenced by historical correspondence. Deterioration in the quality of education and social tension arises only if these changes occur abruptly. Nevertheless, such cases are extremely rare, so I agree with these comments. As Crystal (1987) points out, it is common for the older generation to dislike the modern world, as evidenced by the literature. The influence of the media and the quality of education is not always necessarily linked to direct language changes. Therefore, my support for this position is based on the fact that people are usually afraid of change. Most people need the consistency of developed habits and methods in life. However, language change is a natural process that is not subject to official structures and is formed together with society and its most progressive members.",
    "Changes in the global management paradigm have affected one of the most important components of management – the leadership process. The technological and information revolution has led to the fact that most businesses have the ability to scale their activities to a global scale. This gave the leaders, on the one hand, the opportunity to enter global markets. On the other hand, it led to the need to design business changes in such a way that the company was ready to win against an unlimited number of competitors at every stage of development. This implies the first requirement for a future business leader: a company mission that does not provide for the pursuit of global leadership will not lead to success. Therefore, the design of change should be based on the goal of achieving global leadership, which refers primarily to cultural management skills. No one can deny the fact that cultural differences have a significant impact on the behavior and actions of a leader. Based on this, it becomes quite obvious that these differences are usually reflected in the ways of distributing working time, decision-making, and methods of motivation. The concept of leadership is an integral element in the system of international relations, which largely determines the course of the world’s political and economic processes. According to Ratanjee (2021), “the topic of developing a global mindset and exposing leaders to multicountry and multicultural experiences is gaining increasing interest” (pp. 2). It is clear that transformational leadership in the leadership process is strongly suggested for future leaders. Bonsu and Evans (2018) state that “embracing cross-cultural transformational leadership is strategic to business growth in an era of globalization, efficiency in technology and information dissemination, and parity of education and skills” (p. 50). With discernment and charisma, transformational leaders are able to inspire those around them to change their expectations and motivations in order to move towards higher goals.",
    "Goals and objectives outline desired outcomes and, thus, are often used interchangeably. However, the effect, timeframe, and specificity of the two terms set them apart. Nickels et al. (2019) define goals as broad and long-term outcomes that an organization seeks, while objectives define the measurable, specific, and short-term strategies for attaining the identified goal. For example, the criminal justice system uses goals to task the police, correctional agencies, and the court with the strategy to execute, including deterrence, rehabilitation, retribution, restoration, and incapacitation. Therefore, the criminal justice system particularly addresses criminal behavior with the objective of protecting people’s rights. In an era of rapid change, diversity, and complexity, leadership and management are critical to the survival of any agency. Besides, the ability to lead and manage strongly permeates every aspect of the criminal justice system. While leaders guide the change through a vision, managers implement coordinated processes and structures to pursue organizational goals and objectives (Nickels et al., 2019). Leaders are constantly challenged to take risks and encourage transformation. In law enforcement, for example, police leaders must develop and instill high standards in other officers to work toward the same goal. Beyond leadership, criminal justice relies on managers to optimize processes and lead efforts toward reliable outcomes. Generally, criminal justice leaders and managers work effectively to balance ethical and legal considerations. Earning a degree in criminal justice would significantly contribute to meeting my long-term goals. I have always taken pride in influencing change as a leader. However, I must leverage my education with experience in the criminal justice system to become more efficient and productive. The criminal justice system is becoming increasingly complex and requires more lasting and transformative trends. As such, the second goal is to become more adaptable to change. Bringing significant change through robust analytical skills is an objective in itself. Also, gaining strong relational skills to work with professionals and serve people from diverse backgrounds.",
    "The phrase that caught me most from the video is from Isaiah, stating that Samuel has taught him that one person can play t-ball and hit it hard when sitting down. This is a powerful statement indicating that people can be prejudiced despite having good intentions. Samuel’s family did not realize the struggles disabled people go through before he was born (PinehurstPictures, 2010). The child’s image hitting the t-ball also showcased a powerful issue, that disabled individuals should be treated similarly to other people and given equal opportunities to give them the chance to perform optimally. I was intrigued to see children like Nathanial Orellana learning in a normal classroom. His mother determined they sought school actively to ensure he received the best care considering his autism (PinehurstPictures, 2010). Parents face a myriad of extra challenges raising disabled children to give them advantages that would help them compete with their peers in society. The video illustrates that communities and the government should provide parents with a variety of schools to determine the best for their child’s disability. Children with disabilities require special care but should be allowed to interact with others if their illness would not worsen based on these connections. Engagement is a crucial tool for child development as it requires them to be attentive and active, propagating greater achievement due to increased enthusiasm. Nathanial raises his hand to answer a question because each student is engaged in the classroom. His enthusiasm to answer the question shows interest and a desire to learn, traits associated with high achievement. The video is helpful because it provides a glimpse of the life individuals with disabilities pass through. Many of these parents face issues with education as they would like their children to receive the best education while also avoiding the pitfalls that other children do not face. Emily, a mental health advocate, has schizophrenia and discerns that people without the illness cannot fully understand their plight (PinehurstPictures, 2010). In this aspect, people without developmental problems may not see the issues they face and should work hard to help them optimally function in society. Keith Jones also showcases an important faction of society. He claims that individuals should not expect children to develop good social skills if they stay for eight hours in a classroom without adequate interaction (PinehurstPictures, 2010). It is crucial to recognize that inclusion would work well if children were given a chance to interact frequently despite their differences.",
    "The article’s thesis statement is supported by the further reading authors investigating the case of a strange change in Professor Wilson’s lifestyle. Indeed, the reasoning behind such a decision was complex, and it includes elements of achieving maximum sustainability in the tiniest space possible. In addition, the article mentions that he shares his experiences during the nights when his ecology-focused students are invited to stay in the dumpster with him. The article caught my attention with a few details. First of all, the scenario where a respected scholar lives in the dumpster reminded me of an Ancient Greek philosopher Diogenes who lived in the barrel. Hence, it was interesting to investigate the topic and find if there are any similarities between the two. Furthermore, giving personal details and the personal background of the divorced professor added a bit of psychological interest to it. I wondered if the divorce affects men so severely that they are ready for such a downshift. But these are all subconscious thoughts and triggers. The visuals in the article were crucial to me because I felt a little tired when I started reading. Hence, being able to scroll down and see the pictures of the dumpster, pictures of day-to-day activities, and the interior of the dumpster was a way of relaxing and thinking about the subject. After looking at pictures, I had some questions; therefore, I had a personal interest in reading the article to find the answers. Honestly, the interior of the dumpster does not look that bad, and the best thing is that Wilson is able to lay there comfortably. Therefore, personally, living in a dumpster is an option for times when I feel like I need to be alone. But lack of commodities associated with the home kitchen and bathroom is why I could not choose the dumpster as a place of my permanent residence.",
    "Both lookism and extreme body modification are inherently linked to unhealthy and unrealistic beauty standards of modern society. This trait aside, however, the two are very different in its manifestations and direct consequences. Lookism is merely the act of considering someone whose appearance is not what most people would regard to be beautiful. It focuses on exhibiting negative judgement to people that do not fit the standard and is thus oriented outside of the person who engages in it. Extreme body modification is the act of changing one’s body in order to look in a way that deviates from the norms that society sets on appearance (Good, 2016). To contrast these two, one does not look pleasing in appearance, while the other intentionally marks oneself in ways that others would perceive as deviances or outside of societal standards. The differences between the two stem from their external or internal angles, despite both being related to the dissatisfaction with appearance. It is likely that a person who engages in lookism is deeply insecure about their own beauty, and thus takes a judgemental stance towards the beauty of others. Obsessiveness over other peoples’ features or grooming habits generally signals a very unhealthy relationship with self-image, despite being less visible than bodily modifications (Good, 2016). Meanwhile, said modifications can happen both by a person’s own accord, and as an act of social pressure or custom. An example of the latter would be an ancient Chinese tradition of binding female feet to make them small and rose-like in their shape. More often then not, the expectations of extreme bodily modifications are placed on women, who are expected to conform to them in certain cultures to uphold their respectability and perceived marital value.",
    "The Prince, written by Nicholas Machiavelli, is an important contribution to the modern concept of politics. In a sense, this work contradicts the philosophical tradition of ancient political thought in which political practice is overshadowed by the idealization of governments and utopian cities. On the contrary, in Prince, Machiavelli (2014) establishes that the real implementation of politics implies real situations with real people whose behavior, decisions and actions usually are not necessarily moral. The main theme of “The Prince” by Machiavelli is monarchical rule and survival. This work was regarded as a guide for politicians on the use of ruthless, self-serving cunning and inspired the term “Machiavellian”. Machiavelli (2014) discusses in detail how a ruler should act in various situations or circumstances and establishes that the main goal of politics is the successful retention of power. The book had a lasting effect on political thought since in it, Machiavelli opposed the traditional attitude to politics that serves the people to a benign self-interest, where the ruler is self-centered and focused on his goals. The book justifies any means as long as they help the governor to achieve his aims. According to Hobbes, people are egoistic, greedy, and seek personal gain. Egoism is declared to be the main incentive of human activity. But Hobbes does not condemn people for their selfish inclinations, does not believe that they are evil by nature. Many people find Hobbes’ view cynical as it is too simplified and not all actions can be explained by egoism. For example, there are a lot of people and charity organizations that donate their money and time for free without any personal gain. As for me, I find human nature infinitely more complex than power-seeking individuals described in Hobbes’s work.",
    "Levels of culture can be displayed in different planes and depths. According to Edgar Shein, who developed the concept ‘levels of organizational culture,’ and Edward Granter who later expanded on this concept, the culture of the entity can be seen in four levels: super-structural, symbolic, discursive, and cognitive (Granter, 2019). In other words, the levels of culture in enterprises are developed due to external economic and social influences, artifacts such as logos, story rituals and events, values explicitly expressed by the organization, and underlying assumptions. This paper aims to assess the levels of organizational culture for Macomb Community College. Artifacts in Macomb Community College show that it promotes concentration, attentiveness, and responsibility, which is reflected in the logo. Looking at the architecture of the buildings, some of which use chrome-plated modern high-tech structures, one can assume that technology and science are the main focus of educational programs. Nonetheless, the central older building and a park with large trees create an atmosphere of solitude and introspection, which is more in line with the study of fine arts and social sciences. Equally important, the college has a high culture of mutual help and respect and cherishes community relations, which is reflected in the developed bus route system available to students. On the value level, many signs within the college, including parking signs, library signs, and other clues, point to a love of order and organization. Probably in this college, teachers appreciate the composure and commitment shown by students. On the level of assumptions, the college probably seeks to avoid accepting students who are overly self-expressive or whose identity is tied to superficial popular culture. The college website lacks flashy headlines or programs offering to participate in the community in a frivolous way, such as selling cookies for fundraising or taking part in field trips. Thus, the levels of organizational culture at the Macomb Community College were assessed. The college has a clear identity at the level of artifacts and values. At the same time, the analysis of underlying assumptions suggests several recommendations. Perhaps, the college underestimates the importance of openness in relationships and is too harsh on manifestations of superficial identity or judgment. Given the high commitment to social and community values, Macomb Community College members should consider that openness is an important value for building good social connections."

    "The world watched in horror as Russia's iron fist slammed down upon Ukraine, shattering the fragile peace. Ukrainian defiance burned bright, their courage a beacon against the encroaching darkness. But the fight was young, and every sunrise threatened to usher in an even bloodier chapter. The spectre of a major war, a ghost not seen in decades, stalked across Europe. Families were torn apart, their lives packed into desperate suitcases as they fled for the safety of neighbouring borders. The air vibrated with the terrifying symphony of war, the relentless barrage of artillery fire a grim soundtrack to the exodus. \n\nThrough the lens of the world's media, the conflict unfolded in a thousand different narratives. Two newspapers, the New York Times and Le Monde, became windows into this unfolding tragedy, each offering a unique perspective. When Russian forces seized the city of Kharkiv, the NYT declared in bold letters, \"Russian Troops Take Over Kharkiv,\" their language hinting at the cold efficiency of a military operation. Le Monde, however, painted a starkly different picture with their headline: \"La Russie A Envahi Kharkiv\" - \"Russia Has Invaded Kharkiv.\" The word \"invaded\" dripped with condemnation, laying bare the raw aggression of the act.\n\nLater, a video surfaced of ordinary Ukrainians, transformed into warriors overnight, assembling Molotov cocktails in the heart of Kyiv. The NYT, in their signature direct style, proclaimed, \"Ukraine Prepare Molotov Cocktails in Kyiv,\" highlighting the desperate resolve of the Ukrainian people.  Le Monde, however, saw in this act not just desperation, but the spirit of defiance. Their headline read, \"Ukrainian Resistance Using Molotov Bombs.\" \n\nEvery headline, a carefully crafted story in itself, designed to draw the reader in. The New York Times, with its evocative language, painted a picture of a world on the brink, teetering towards another global conflict. Le Monde, on the other hand, chose to focus on the human cost, the courage and resilience of the Ukrainian people, and the stark injustice of Russia's actions. Two newspapers, two lenses, each reflecting the harsh realities of war in their own way. \n",
    "Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed colleagues,\n\nToday, we delve into the organizational structure of the Charles Schwab Corporation, a prominent entity in the financial services sector.\n\nAt its core, Charles Schwab operates as a for-profit corporation, specializing in savings and loans, asset management, and financial advisory services. The corporation's extensive reach is facilitated by several subsidiaries, including Charles Schwab & Co., Inc., Charles Schwab Investment Management, Inc., TD Ameritrade, Inc., and TD Ameritrade Clearing, Inc., all structured as limited liability companies.\n\nThe corporate form bestows upon Charles Schwab several distinct characteristics.  Firstly, a clear delineation exists between the roles of officers, directors, and shareholders.  Officers serve as agents of the corporation, responsible for its day-to-day operations. Directors, elected by the shareholders, provide oversight and strategic direction. Shareholders, as investors, are not directly involved in management but hold ownership stakes.\n\nGovernance is vested in a board of directors, responsible for appointing officers, including key positions such as the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO). This structure ensures a balance of power, with the board providing oversight and the officers executing strategy. The board retains the authority to remove officers if deemed necessary.\n\nA key advantage of the corporate form is the transferability of ownership. Shareholders are free to buy and sell shares, providing liquidity and flexibility. In critical situations, such as bankruptcy, the corporation itself can be sold to another entity, ensuring continuity of operations.\n\nHowever, the corporate structure also presents a tax disadvantage.  Corporations are subject to double taxation, with income taxed first at the corporate level and again when distributed as dividends to shareholders.\n\nIn conclusion, the Charles Schwab Corporation operates as a publicly traded corporation, adhering to the legal and regulatory framework governing this business structure. The corporate form provides distinct advantages, such as limited liability, centralized management, and transferability of ownership.  However, it also presents challenges, most notably double taxation.  Understanding the nuances of Charles Schwab's corporate structure is essential for investors and stakeholders alike. \n",
    "The role of a clinical or medical office worker blends extensive administrative tasks with essential medical activities.  Essentially, these professionals are the backbone of the office, handling paperwork, interacting with staff, and ensuring smooth daily operations.  \n\nGiven this professional setting, I plan to approach job interviews in a polished and business-like manner. Fortunately, I already own a classic black formal suit, shoes, and minimal accessories, allowing me to project the right image without exceeding my budget. In warmer weather, the suit alone will suffice, while in colder months, I can easily add my usual overcoat.\n\nWhile my interview attire is covered, the work attire may require some additional investment.  Healthcare workers, including administrative staff, typically wear scrubs – a short-sleeved shirt and trousers. However,  scrubs are relatively inexpensive, with sets available online for around $20-$40. Comfortable, closed-toe shoes are also essential for this role, as these professionals are often on their feet. While good quality options can cost around $100, my current tennis shoes meet the dress code requirements.\n\nIt's important to note that many healthcare institutions provide uniforms to employees, considering them consumables. Therefore, the decision to purchase scrubs will depend on the specific hospital's policy. In any case, the uniform is simple and practical, posing no significant financial burden.\n\nAfter considering the potential costs associated with interview and work attire, I am confident that it will have minimal impact on my budget and life plan. In an ideal scenario where the hospital provides uniforms, I would incur no additional expenses, as I can utilize my existing suit for interviews and shoes for work. Even if I need to purchase scrubs, the cost remains manageable within my budget.  \n\nThis exercise has reassured me that interview and work attire will not be an obstacle. I am well-prepared in this aspect and can confidently focus on other essential preparations for my job search. \n",
    "Carl Jung posits that the mother complex stems from the innate feeling of care central to the mother-child bond. He suggests that when this bond is absent or deficient, an archetype emerges, reflecting the unmet needs of the child within the relationship (Bobroff 35). This can lead the individual to seek emotional fulfillment elsewhere.\n\nJung's concept of the mother archetype suggests that within the mother-child dynamic, two opposing forces are at play: one nurturing and security-providing, the other characterized by possessiveness, deprivation, and darkness (Bobroff 36).\n\nThe film \"Every Secret Thing\" explores a complex mother-daughter relationship between Alice and her mother, Helen. This complex dynamic, marked by both attachment and dysfunction,  underpins their interactions and intertwines with the film's central theme of kidnapping. \n\nHelen's favoritism towards Ronnie, a childhood friend of Alice's, creates insecurity and a sense of displacement for Alice. This dynamic plays a significant role in the events surrounding the kidnappings.  The film also touches upon the complexities of interracial relationships, particularly in the context of the second kidnapping. Alice's history – having birthed a biracial child while incarcerated and subsequently placing the child for adoption – makes her a prime suspect (Berg).\n\nThe film reveals that Helen is the orchestrator of the kidnappings and the perpetrator of a murder in the first instance. She deliberately places evidence to implicate Alice, culminating in Alice's wrongful imprisonment. Through manipulation and betrayal, Helen ensures Alice takes the fall for her crimes (Berg). \n\nThe film contrasts the complex relationship between Alice and Helen with the indifference displayed by Ronnie's parents, highlighting the absence of a strong emotional bond in the latter case. The ending reveals that both Alice and Ronnie were wrongly convicted, while the justice system fails to hold Helen accountable for her actions. \n",
    "The article recounts a disturbing incident at a Chicago hot dog restaurant, raising serious ethical concerns. A man, upon being politely asked to wear a mask in accordance with state mandates, unleashed a shocking display of aggression. Instead of simply complying or refusing service, he hurled snow multiple times into the face of the employee, a gesture as humiliating as it was unnecessary. To compound his outburst, the enraged customer then grabbed an unknown object and smashed the restaurant’s glass door, leaving behind shards of glass and a stunned silence in his wake (Sutton, 2022).\n\nThis incident transcends a simple disagreement over mask-wearing. The customer's disproportionate reaction, escalating from verbal abuse to physical assault and property damage, signifies a blatant disregard for social norms and ethical conduct.  \n\nExamining this situation through a utilitarian lens reveals the clear ethical transgression.  Utilitarianism focuses on the consequences of actions, deeming those that produce harm as wrong. In this case, the shattered glass door and the traumatized employee stand as stark evidence of the harm inflicted. The customer’s actions, fueled by a sense of entitlement and disrespect, directly resulted in negative consequences, marking his behavior as undeniably wrong from a utilitarian perspective. \n\nKantian moral theory further reinforces this judgment. By prioritizing his own frustration over the inherent moral duty to treat others with respect and refrain from causing harm, the customer acted irrationally.  His disregard for established moral laws, both societal and legal, paints him as irrational and morally culpable in the eyes of Kantian ethics.\n\nWhile both ethical frameworks condemn the customer’s actions,  the clarity of utilitarianism resonates more strongly in this particular case.  The tangible harm inflicted – the shattered glass, the emotional distress of the employee, the disruption to the restaurant's operations – provides undeniable proof of the negative consequences. While Kantian ethics relies on the potentially subjective interpretation of moral law, utilitarianism offers a more concrete and objective measure of right and wrong based on the tangible impact of actions. \n",
    "The fight against HIV requires bold solutions, and a groundbreaking study published in the esteemed medical journal, The Lancet, reveals a compelling and surprisingly effective weapon: financial stability. This isn't mere conjecture; it's the result of a rigorous study, further amplified by The Economist, showcasing the profound impact of economic empowerment on vulnerable populations.\n\nFunded by the World Bank and spearheaded by leading poverty and health experts, the study focused on a demographic acutely affected by HIV: young girls in poverty.  Over 1,300 unmarried girls aged 13 to 22 in Malawi's Zomba district participated, a sample size robust enough to draw meaningful conclusions about HIV prevalence in such regions.\n\nThe study employed a randomized controlled trial, the gold standard in research, to eliminate bias and ensure accuracy. Girls were randomly assigned to three groups: one receiving monthly stipends for their families, another receiving school fee subsidies, and a control group receiving no financial assistance.  The results were striking.  The groups receiving financial assistance, either directly or indirectly, experienced a significant decrease in HIV infection rates. This powerful correlation highlights the direct link between poverty, risky behavior, and HIV vulnerability. \n\nWhy such a dramatic difference? The answer is both heartbreaking and illuminating. Without financial security, many young girls are forced into transactional relationships with older men, often referred to as \"sugar daddies,\" as a means of survival. This places them at a significantly higher risk of contracting HIV. The study demonstrates that even modest financial support can break this cycle of desperation, empowering girls to make safer choices.\n\nThe implications are clear: financial support is not just charity; it's a potent tool in the fight against HIV. While further research is needed to determine long-term impacts and optimal levels of support, this study provides undeniable evidence that addressing the economic roots of this epidemic is not just compassionate but strategically imperative.  The global community must heed this call to action and invest in sustainable solutions that empower young women and dismantle the economic barriers that fuel the spread of HIV. \n",
    "Horror films have secured their place as a cornerstone of cinema, their popularity rivaling any other genre. This enduring appeal stems from a unique ability to evoke a powerful emotional response in viewers – a surge of primal fear that, for many, offers a strange form of psychological relief. \n\nTo understand this phenomenon, we must first acknowledge that fear, while unpleasant, is an essential human emotion. It is, at its core, an instinct for self-preservation, a reaction hardwired into us to confront potential threats. So why then, as Stephen King aptly questions in his essay \"Why We Crave Horror Movies,\" would anyone willingly pay to experience such an unsettling emotion?\n\nKing posits that people are drawn to horror because it allows them to \"re-establish their feelings of essential normality\" (King, 1).  In the safe darkness of a movie theater, fear becomes a cathartic release, a way to reset our emotional equilibrium. For some, it's a welcome distraction from everyday anxieties; for others, an adrenaline rush that awakens dulled senses.  \n\nBut beyond the individual experience, horror films also tap into a fundamental element of art: the power to evoke emotion and provide ethical pleasure.  While seemingly paradoxical, the very success of horror, even more so than other genres, hinges on the audience's visceral reaction (Glasby, 7).  The genre thrives on its ability to elicit gasps, screams, and nervous laughter – tangible proof of its impact. \n\nTherefore, to categorize horror films as a modern form of \"public lynching\" is a gross mischaracterization.  Horror is not about inflicting suffering; it's about exploring the dark corners of our psyche within a controlled and safe environment. The intense emotional response, the shared experience of fear and release, is what elevates horror to an art form – a testament to the power of storytelling and our innate fascination with the unknown. \n",
    "Genetic mutations, alterations within an organism's DNA sequence, are fascinating phenomena that can lead to diverse outcomes.  This essay will delve into the intriguing realm of spontaneous mutations, those that occur randomly without a known cause.\n\nImagine a flock of sheep where a lamb is unexpectedly born with shorter legs. This is a prime example of a spontaneous mutation, a change in the genetic code that can manifest in various ways, even in humans.\n\nConsider the ADRB1 gene, responsible for regulating sleep duration. While most individuals require eight or more hours of sleep for optimal functioning, approximately 5% of the population possesses a mutated version of this gene. This alteration enables them to thrive on a mere 4 to 6 hours of sleep per night, as demonstrated in a study involving a mother and daughter with this mutation (Servick, 2019).\n\nThis particular mutation, classified as a genomic mutation, affects the protein that acts as a receptor for norepinephrine, a neurotransmitter involved in sleep regulation.  Inherited in a dominant, autosomal pattern, this mutation is considered beneficial as it does not negatively impact an individual's health or survival.\n\nWhile predominantly observed in humans, similar mutations in the ADRB1 gene could theoretically occur in other species, although research in this area is currently limited. Importantly, this mutation does not pose any known threats to human health and does not appear to be spreading widely within the population. Instead, it represents a unique and advantageous adaptation for those who carry it.\n\nThe study of spontaneous mutations like this one is crucial for advancing our understanding of human genetics and unlocking the potential for enhancing human capabilities. These naturally occurring variations in our DNA provide valuable insights into the complexities of life and offer tantalizing glimpses into the possibilities of human evolution. \n",
    "Art Spiegelman's graphic novel, Maus, is more than just a historical account; it's a punch to the gut that forces readers to confront the raw, unfiltered reality of the Holocaust. Through the ingenious use of anthropomorphism, depicting nationalities as different animals, Spiegelman breaks down a complex and horrifying event into a narrative as accessible as it is heart-wrenching.  We are reminded that within the historical tragedy, there were individuals with lives, loves, and dreams, brutally cut short or forever scarred by the horrors they endured.\n\nFrom the very first chapter, \"The Sheik,\" Spiegelman subverts expectations. Artie, a young man grappling with his family's past, asks his father, Vladek, to recount his wartime experiences.  Instead of launching into the anticipated tales of suffering, Vladek focuses on his carefree life in 1935 (Spiegelman, 1980, pp. 13-23). This poignant choice reveals a universal truth: even in the face of unimaginable trauma, the human spirit clings to the comfort of happier memories.\n\nChapter 3, \"Prisoner of War,\" plunges us into the chaotic reality of war. As Vladek recounts his experiences as a soldier, a chilling detail emerges.  He vividly remembers the name of a soldier he killed (Spiegelman, 1980, p. 50). This seemingly insignificant memory highlights the capricious nature of trauma, how our minds fixate on seemingly random details amidst horrific events.  Yet, even within this darkness, a glimmer of hope emerges: Vladek's reunion with his family overshadows the horrors he endured as a prisoner.\n\nThe true brilliance of Maus lies in its ability to convey the emotional weight of seemingly mundane moments. In Chapter 5, \"Mouse Holes,\" the daily struggle for survival becomes agonizingly clear.  Mice, representing Jews forced into hiding, make impossible choices, clinging to the slimmest chances of survival (Spiegelman, 1980).  The unimaginable grief of parents learning about their children's deaths, the constant fear of capture – these realities are presented with a starkness that is both heartbreaking and unforgettable.\n\nThrough deceptively simple comic panels, Spiegelman crafts a masterpiece that transcends the graphic novel genre.  Maus is a testament to the resilience of the human spirit, the enduring power of memory, and a searing indictment of hatred and indifference. The animal imagery, far from minimizing the horrors, amplifies them.  The \"cats,\" representing the Nazis, are stripped of any humanity, revealed as predators driven by a chillingly banal evil. Maus is not just a story about the Holocaust; it is a story about the fragility of humanity and the enduring power of hope, even in the darkest of times. \n",
    "In the digital loom where threads of data intertwine, the weaving of a web-based system to cradle a university's heart – its students' stories, their academic tapestries – holds both promise and peril.  Before this digital vessel sets sail, we must chart the seas of risk that lie ahead, for even the sturdiest ship can founder on unseen shoals.\n\nTwo specters loom large in this digital odyssey.  The first whispers of storms that threaten the very journey itself – unforeseen delays that stretch time like a taut thread, the fragility of human endeavor as illness might grip those who labor at the loom, and the capricious nature of technology, where hardware and software can falter like a weaver's weary hand.\n\nThe second whispers of dangers that await the tapestry itself, once woven and unfurled. Will it be a shield against prying eyes, safeguarding the sanctity of students' personal narratives? Will its threads be spun of gold, or will its creation drain the university's coffers, leaving only a tattered remnant behind? And will this digital creation truly reflect the university's vision, meeting its needs with seamless grace?\n\nTime, that relentless river, holds the key to the first set of risks.  By comparing our progress to the map laid out at the outset, we can gauge if we are adrift. Functionality, like the intricate patterns within the tapestry, can be tested against the university's aspirations, ensuring alignment. And for the frailties of human hands and the whims of machines, we must weave in buffers of time, allowing for the mending of broken threads and the arrival of fresh supplies.\n\nYet, the risks that lie dormant within the tapestry's very essence are more elusive.  Like hidden flaws in a seemingly flawless weave, they may only reveal themselves once the tapestry is complete.  Vigilance during the weaving process is paramount, testing each thread, each pattern, for inherent weaknesses.  Should these shadows emerge, swift and decisive action will be needed, to mend and reinforce before the tapestry is unfurled for all to see.\n\nThis journey into the digital unknown is not without its perils, yet with careful planning, constant vigilance, and a willingness to adapt, we can navigate these treacherous waters and deliver a tapestry worthy of the stories it holds within its digital embrace. \n",
    "Let's break down how well ABC Company is doing financially by looking at three key figures:\n\n* **Return on Assets (RoA):** This tells us how good the company is at making money from all its stuff, even the things it borrowed money to buy.  A high RoA is like getting a good return on an investment.\n* **Return on Equity (RoE):** This is similar to RoA, but it only looks at the money that the company's owners have put in. A high RoE means the owners are getting a good return on their investment.\n* **Profit Margin:** This shows us how much money the company actually makes from each dollar of sales.  A high profit margin means the company is keeping more of the money it earns. \n\n**ABC Company's Report Card:**\n\n* **Good News:** ABC Company is making a profit!  Its RoA and RoE are both looking good, which is a positive sign for investors. The profit margin is also strong, meaning the company is managing its costs well.\n* **Room for Growth:** While ABC Company is doing well on its own, it's still small compared to the big players in its industry. The industry average for RoA is around 9%, and ABC Company is currently at 28.3%. This sounds great, but ABC Company makes a lot less money overall. \n* **What it Means:**  As ABC Company grows and makes more money, its impressive ratios might go down a bit. This is because it's often easier to have high returns when you're smaller. \n\n**Looking Ahead:**\n\nABC Company needs to focus on growing its sales without letting its profit margins shrink too much.  If it can keep making money at a good rate as it gets bigger, it has the potential to become a real leader in its industry. \n",
    "Both \"The Iliad\" and \"Metamorphosis\" take us on a journey to a world ruled by gods, exploring the drama and consequences of their relationships with each other and us mere mortals.  A big theme in both stories is how those in charge sometimes abuse their power.\n\nIn \"The Iliad,\" King Agamemnon throws a tantrum and treats people unfairly because he's used to getting his way. He even says, \"Don't think I'll be the only Greek left... without my prize!\" (Homer).  Similarly,  \"Metamorphosis\" shows us gods acting all high and mighty, like when Ovid writes,  \"What the waves spared, the flames now threatened.\" \n\nHere's the catch: \"The Iliad\" often shows us that these power-hungry gods eventually face consequences for their actions, a kind of cosmic karma.  But \"Metamorphosis\" sometimes plays the whole power abuse thing for laughs, which makes it a bit less impactful.  \n\nThe idea of protecting everyday people is still super relevant today.  Think about some world leaders who seem to have endless power, whether it's through politics, money, or both. The way some countries, like China, are criticized for not respecting human rights reminds us of those power-hungry gods in the stories.\n\nWhile both \"The Iliad\" and \"Metamorphosis\" are super insightful,  \"The Iliad\" hits harder when it comes to condemning violence against regular people by those in power.  It feels more relevant to how we see power abuse today. \n\nBut here's the takeaway: both stories give us a lot to think about. They show us how power dynamics worked in ancient Greece, but they also hold up a mirror to our own world.  It makes you wonder, are things really that different now? \n",
    "Zulaika's 2022 article sheds light on the complex challenges faced by secondary school girls in Kenya during the COVID-19 lockdowns, particularly the rise in adolescent pregnancies and school dropouts. While the extended school closures from March 2020 to January 2021 presented unforeseen difficulties, Zulaika's research highlights important opportunities for growth and positive change. \n\nThe study's findings underscore the urgent need for increased engagement from health administrators in addressing adolescent sexual and reproductive health. By proactively providing comprehensive sexual education and access to resources, we can empower young people to make informed decisions about their well-being. This includes raising awareness about various methods of protection and fostering open dialogues about reproductive health.\n\nBy investing in these crucial areas, we can help create a brighter future for Kenyan girls. Early intervention and education can play a transformative role in promoting healthy pregnancies, reducing school dropouts, and ensuring that young mothers have the support they need to thrive.  \n\nZulaika's call for population-level interventions, including comprehensive sexual education programs in schools, is a positive step towards empowering adolescents with the knowledge and resources they need to make healthy choices. By engaging students and parents alike, we can create a more supportive and informed environment where young people feel empowered to take control of their reproductive health.\n\nWhile the article highlights a real concern, it also underscores the incredible potential for positive change. By working together, communities, educators, and healthcare providers can equip young people with the knowledge and support they need to navigate the challenges of adolescence and create a brighter future for themselves and their nation. \n",

    "You know, it's crazy how Amazon has become such a big deal. Like, everyone uses it, right? Fast shipping, good prices – you can't really beat it. But there's a flip side to all that. \n\nLately, there have been a lot of people speaking out about how Amazon treats its workers, and it's not pretty.  It's like they've grown so fast that they've forgotten about the people who actually make the whole thing run. \n\nHere's the thing:  paying people $15 an hour might sound okay at first, especially in areas where jobs are scarce,  but it's not a long-term solution.  People want to feel valued, and that means getting regular raises and feeling like they can build a future. If Amazon doesn't change its tune, people are just going to keep quitting, and who can blame them? \n\nAnd it's not just about the money, you know? It's the whole vibe. They're all about efficiency and hitting targets,  and it seems like there's not much room for, well, being human.  It's all about fear and pressure,  which just makes people shut down and stop caring.\n\n Honestly,  Amazon needs to chill out a bit. They need to bring back things like regular raises, bonuses that actually mean something,  and stop timing every little thing people do.   It's about treating people with respect and giving them a reason to stick around.  Otherwise, they're going to lose good people, and their reputation is going to keep taking a hit. \n",
    "The institution of American slavery, rooted in the capitalist exploitation of labor, tragically evolved into a complex and self-perpetuating system of social, economic, and political control. While the abolitionist movement bravely challenged the morality and legality of owning human beings, the road to true freedom for enslaved people proved long and arduous.\n\nThe formal emancipation granted after the Civil War, while momentous, did not erase the deep scars of oppression or alleviate the dire circumstances faced by newly freed individuals.  Stripped of their basic rights and denied opportunities for generations, former slaves emerged from bondage lacking essential resources, education, and social support.  \n\nThe ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment in 1865 outlawed slavery, forever etching its abolition into the fabric of American law. However, this landmark achievement did not automatically translate into equality or economic security for those who had been unjustly enslaved.  Discrimination persisted, hindering their integration into society and denying them fair access to opportunities. \n\nThe question of reparations for the immeasurable harm inflicted upon generations of enslaved people remains a complex and deeply relevant issue. While freedom was undeniably a victory, the lack of material and psychological support created significant barriers to true emancipation.  Without land, financial resources, or a societal framework that embraced their full humanity, formerly enslaved individuals faced immense challenges in rebuilding their lives.  \n\nThe legacy of slavery serves as a stark reminder that true freedom extends beyond the absence of chains.  It necessitates a just and equitable society where all members have equal opportunities to thrive and reach their full potential. The struggle for genuine equality continues to resonate as we grapple with the ongoing impacts of systemic racism and strive to create a future where the sins of the past are never repeated. \n",

    "Guaman Poma, a descendant of Incan nobility, experienced the brutality of Spanish colonialism firsthand.  After the conquest of Peru, his family lost their land and status, and Poma's attempts to reclaim them were repeatedly denied by the colonial authorities.\n\nDespite initially cooperating with the Spanish, Poma eventually became a vocal critic of their treatment of the native population.  His frustrations came to a head when he was exiled on false accusations of claiming noble lineage. In response, he penned a powerful 1200-page illustrated manuscript addressed to the King of Spain.\n\nThis manuscript, a remarkable document, serves as both a historical record and a scathing indictment of colonialism. Poma meticulously details the rich culture and traditions of the Incas before the Spanish invasion while exposing the horrific abuses inflicted upon his people under colonial rule.  \n\nPoma argues that the Spanish had no right to seize control of Peru, a land he believed was divinely granted to its indigenous inhabitants. He envisions a system of governance that prioritizes the needs and representation of its people, a concept strikingly progressive for its time.\n\nHis work dismantles the colonial narrative that cast Europeans as benevolent civilizers. Instead, he exposes their conquest as a brutal campaign driven by greed, violence, and a desire for power.  Poma reveals how the Spanish used the pretense of \"civilization\" to justify economic exploitation, cultural destruction, and the subjugation of an entire population. \n\nThrough his powerful words and illustrations, Guaman Poma leaves an undeniable mark on history. His work remains a testament to the enduring fight for freedom, self-determination, and the importance of a government that truly represents and serves its people. \n",
    "## The Power and Paradox of Prayer: Weapon, Ritual, and Epiphany\n\nThe act of prayer, often viewed through a lens of personal devotion, reveals a more complex and multifaceted nature when examined through the lens of cognitive psychology and historical analysis.  This essay delves into the dualistic nature of prayer, exploring its potential as both a weapon wielded in social and political spheres and a transformative ritual that deepens an individual's connection to the divine.\n\n**Prayer as a Cognitive Phenomenon:**\n\nThe efficacy of prayer, as argued by Froese and Jones (2021), hinges on the remarkable capabilities of the human mind – specifically, our abilities to shift and focus our attention.  Prayer, particularly in its structured and repetitive forms, acts as a mental exercise, strengthening the neural pathways that connect us to concepts of faith and spirituality.  Through this repeated focusing on the divine, individuals reinforce their belief in a higher power and experience a heightened sense of spiritual connection.\n\n**A Weapon Forged in Faith:**\n\nHowever, the power of prayer extends beyond the personal realm.  Both Froese and Jones (2021) and Martin (2019) highlight its historical and contemporary use as a tool to influence the political landscape.  From ancient Rome, where prayers were believed to have secured victory in battle, to modern political rallies, where invocations of divine favor are commonplace, prayer has served as a potent weapon, rallying support, justifying actions, and even demonizing opponents.\n\n**The Ritualistic Power of Shared Belief:**\n\nBeyond its strategic deployment, prayer also functions as a powerful social ritual, fostering a sense of community and shared identity.  The rhythmic recitation of prayers, often performed collectively, reinforces religious doctrines and strengthens social bonds among believers (Froese & Jones, 2021). This shared experience of vulnerability and hope can lead to a sense of emotional uplift and social acceptance, further cementing the importance of prayer within a religious group.\n\n**Prayer as a Catalyst for Action:**\n\nMartin (2019) expands on this notion, suggesting that prayer can be understood as an \"epiphany strategy,\" a proactive force that shapes future outcomes.  By petitioning a higher power for guidance, protection, or intervention, individuals and groups throughout history have used prayer to alleviate fear, bolster resolve, and even justify actions in the face of adversity.\n\nThis proactive dimension of prayer is evident in numerous historical examples.  Martin (2019) cites the early Christian practice of praying for protection in battle, a tradition extending back to the Israelites, who sought divine favor long before the birth of Jesus. These prayers served not only as pleas for divine intervention but also as psychological tools to instill courage and a sense of righteous purpose.\n\n**A Unified Understanding:**\n\nDespite their distinct areas of focus, both Froese and Jones (2021) and Martin (2019) converge on a crucial point: prayer is inherently proactive. It is not merely a passive plea for divine intervention but an active engagement with one's faith, capable of shaping individual beliefs, influencing social dynamics, and even altering the course of history.\n\n**Repentance:  A Deeper Dive**\n\nThis inherent proactivity is further illustrated in the concept of repentance, as described by Paul in his second letter to the Corinthians (2 Corinthians 7:10).  Repentance, in this context, transcends mere remorse; it is a transformative act of turning away from sin and towards God. This active pursuit of spiritual cleansing allows for a fuller embrace of the Holy Spirit, highlighting the transformative potential inherent within religious practice. \n\n**(Dedication to be added based on the content you provide)** \n",
    "Okay, so imagine you're trying to figure out what's right and wrong in the world.  Two big ideas come into play: relativism and objectivism. \n\nRelativism is like saying, \"Hey,  morality is totally subjective! What's right for you might not be right for me, and that's cool.\" No judgment, right? But some people, like this researcher Porus,  think relativism can turn into a free-for-all where anything goes (Bush and Moss, 2020).  Plus, it might make it harder to find common ground with people if everyone's moral compass is pointing in a different direction.\n\nObjectivism, on the other hand, is all about those universal truths – like there's a fixed right and wrong, no matter what anyone thinks. It's like those rules are carved in stone, passed down from on high, not made up by us mere mortals. The problem is, well, life is messy!  It's hard to imagine a set of rules that perfectly apply to every single situation.\n\nPersonally, I lean towards relativism, even though it has its quirks. I mean,  we make choices every day where there's no clear \"right\" answer.  We try to be good people, but sometimes we mess up, or our actions rub someone the wrong way. It just seems like life is full of gray areas,  and our experiences, personalities, and circumstances all play a role in the choices we make.\n\nObjectivism, to me, feels a bit too simplistic.  It's like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole.  Don't get me wrong, having some shared values is important, but trying to boil down morality to a rigid set of rules feels unrealistic.  \n",
    "The cryptocurrency market is rife with volatility and broken promises.  Early contenders like Bitcoin and Ethereum, while groundbreaking,  have fallen short of delivering a truly scalable, secure, and decentralized digital currency. It's time to turn our attention to a contender with the potential to reshape the financial landscape:  Solana.\n\nFor a business-savvy investor seeking both significant returns and a stake in the future of finance, Solana presents a compelling opportunity. While not brand new to the scene,  Solana's recent surge in value, a staggering 12,000% increase in the past year (Locke, 2021), is not a mere coincidence; it's a clear signal of the market recognizing its inherent strengths. \n\nUnlike its predecessors, Solana tackles the challenges of scalability and transaction speed head-on.  Existing blockchains are plagued by limited transaction capacities and exorbitant fees, making them impractical for widespread adoption (Locke, 2021). Solana, however, boasts lightning-fast transaction speeds and remarkably low fees (Farrington, 2021),  positioning it as a viable solution for everyday transactions.\n\nInvesting in cryptocurrency inherently carries risk, but Solana represents a calculated bet on a transformative technology. Its superior speed, security, and growing support within the cryptocurrency community (Hamilton, 2022)  suggest a future where it transcends the realm of speculative investment and becomes a globally accepted form of currency.\n\nTo solidify its long-term viability,  further research into Solana's environmental impact, particularly its carbon footprint, is warranted. However,  the potential benefits, from revolutionizing financial transactions to empowering individuals through decentralized finance, are undeniable.\n\nIgnoring Solana is ignoring the future of finance. It's time to recognize its potential,  capitalize on its current momentum, and invest in a cryptocurrency with the power to reshape our relationship with money. \n",

This is the essence of yoga, an ancient practice that transcends mere exercise to become a transformative experience.\n\nPicture yourself flowing through graceful postures, each movement a symphony of strength and flexibility. As you breathe deeply,  inhaling vitality and exhaling tension, you feel a sense of calm wash over you.  This is yoga's unique power – to harmonize your physical and mental states, creating a sense of inner peace that radiates outward. \n\nYoga's benefits extend far beyond the mat.  Scientific studies have shown that it can alleviate chronic pain, particularly in those with musculoskeletal conditions like arthritis (Saeed et al., 2019). Imagine the relief of stiff joints finding newfound mobility,  of aching muscles relaxing into a state of ease.  Yoga's breathing techniques,  like gentle waves calming a stormy sea,  improve lung function, bringing a sense of spaciousness and clarity to both body and mind.\n\nAt the heart of yoga lies the profound philosophy of the \"eight limbs,\" a step-by-step guide to achieving enlightenment.

It's a practice that transcends age and background,  a path to rediscovering your inherent strength,  flexibility, and inner peace. Whether you seek physical well-being, emotional balance, or a deeper connection to yourself and the world around you, yoga offers a timeless and transformative path.\n",
    "Imagine a world where the line between entertainment and manipulation blurs, where the stories we consume subtly reinforce the very systems that shape our lives. This is the unsettling reality Theodor Adorno unveils with his concept of the \"culture industry.\"  He argues that in capitalist societies, even our art, music, and movies become tools to promote conformity and uphold the status quo.\n\nThink about it: how often are wealth and happiness intertwined in the movies we watch? How many times have we seen characters achieve fulfillment only after achieving material success?  Adorno suggests these narratives aren't accidental;  they're carefully crafted to make us crave the very things capitalism thrives on – consumption and an endless pursuit of \"more.\"\n\nBut perhaps the most insidious example of the culture industry lies in its impact on young minds. Children,  with their boundless imaginations and uncritical eyes, are particularly vulnerable to its seductive messages. \n\nConsider the world of children's entertainment. From a structural functionalist perspective,  it plays a vital role in socializing children, teaching them important values like kindness, cooperation, and respect for others – essential building blocks for a stable society.\n\nHowever,  Adorno's lens reveals a more cynical truth.  He sees children's entertainment as a Trojan horse for capitalist ideology,  a vehicle for transforming innocent desires into relentless consumer demand.  Companies like Disney, masters of this art, have perfected the formula. \n\nThink about it –  a beloved animated film hits the screens, capturing children's hearts with its catchy songs and endearing characters. And just like magic, a tidal wave of merchandise floods the market – toys, clothes, lunchboxes,  all strategically designed to keep the film's magic (and its ability to drive profits) alive long after the credits roll (Clement, 2018).\n\nThis calculated blending of entertainment and marketing creates a powerful feedback loop.  Children, bombarded with these carefully crafted messages, internalize the idea that happiness and belonging are intrinsically linked to owning the latest products. The cycle of desire, consumption, and fleeting satisfaction becomes deeply ingrained,  perpetuating the very system that benefits from it. \n",
    "Archetypes are more than just literary devices; they are the very blueprints of human understanding, shaping how we perceive the world and everyone in it. These universal patterns, embedded in our collective unconscious, define our understanding of heroes, villains, lovers, and everything in between. Recognizing their power in everyday life is key to unlocking deeper meaning in our interactions and navigating the complexities of human behavior.\n\nConsider the enigmatic Elon Musk. His relentless drive to disrupt industries, from electric vehicles to space exploration, paints him as a modern-day hero – a Creator archetype,  driven by an insatiable desire to revolutionize the world. This archetype isn't just a label; it's a powerful force shaping public perception,  fueling his followers' enthusiasm, and driving his own ambitious actions.\n\nThe presence of archetypes in everyday life empowers us to move beyond superficial judgments and delve into the underlying motivations and patterns driving those around us. By recognizing the Hero in a colleague's tireless work ethic or the Jester in a friend's infectious humor, we gain a nuanced understanding of their behavior,  allowing us to build stronger, more meaningful relationships.\n\nOf course, real life is more complex than fiction. People rarely embody a single archetype in its entirety.  We are complex mixtures, our personalities a tapestry of different archetypal threads.  Yet, by recognizing the dominant patterns, we gain valuable insights into their decision-making, values, and aspirations.\n\nUnderstanding archetypes is akin to having a secret decoder ring for human behavior. It allows us to anticipate actions, navigate conflicts more effectively, and even inspire those around us by appealing to their deeply held archetypal desires. This isn't about manipulation; it's about unlocking a deeper level of understanding and connection in an often-confusing world.\n\n\n",
    "Imagine a vast, icy wilderness teeming with some of the world's most sought-after seafood. Alaska, a land synonymous with fishing,  faces a critical question: how can we ensure the long-term health and sustainability of this precious resource, especially in the face of changing environmental and economic pressures?\n\nThis is where the story gets interesting.  Drawing upon a trove of data spanning three decades, from meticulous harvest records to insightful literature reviews, researchers have embarked on a journey to unravel the intricate web of factors that influence the diversity and resilience of Alaskan fisheries. \n\nWe delve into the heart of Alaska's fishing communities,  examining firsthand how fishers,  fleets, and entire towns have adapted to a perfect storm of challenges -  declining fish populations,  volatile markets,  and the controversial privatization of fishing rights. \n\nOne study, a treasure map for understanding the pulse of Alaska's sport fishing scene, zooms in on the Anchorage Management Area from 2016 to 2018. This isn't just dry data; it's a narrative woven from the historical tapestry of each fishery,  revealing the delicate dance between fishing regulations,  fish populations, and the very people who depend on them.\n\nAnother report,  a beacon of reliability from the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, unveils the intricate workings of sport fisheries in the North Gulf Coast Management Area. This official source provides a crucial window into the health and productivity of these fisheries,  giving us the data we need to make informed decisions about their future. \n\nExpert-verified and rigorously researched,  these studies are more than just academic exercises; they are vital tools for charting a course towards sustainable fishing practices that benefit both the ecosystem and the communities that depend on it. \n\nBy understanding the complex interplay of ecological and economic forces at play,  we can empower policymakers, industry leaders, and fishing communities alike to make informed decisions that ensure Alaska's fishing legacy continues for generations to come. \n",
    "Deductive reasoning is like building a strong, logical bridge between causes and their effects.  This connection can link two known facts or connect a current situation to a future outcome (Besnard & Hunter, 2018). Think of it like this:  you start with your starting points (premises) and use logic to reach a conclusion.\n\nIn the world of logic,  an argument is considered valid if its structure guarantees that *if* the premises are true,  the conclusion *must* also be true.  Notice how this doesn't mean the premises actually *are* true, just that the conclusion would logically follow *if* they were. \n\nHere's an example:\n\n1. All whales are mammals. \n2. All mammals have lungs.\n3. Therefore, all whales have lungs. \n\nThis argument holds water logically, even if we were to swap out \"whales\" and \"mammals\" with fantastical creatures. The structure ensures the conclusion follows logically from the premises. \n\nHowever, for an argument to be considered sound, it needs more than just a valid structure – its premises must also be true in the real world.  A valid argument can still be unsound if it's built on false assumptions.\n\nConsider this:\n\n1. All birds can fly.\n2. Penguins are birds.\n3. Therefore, penguins can fly. \n\nThe structure is valid (the conclusion follows logically), but the first premise is false,  making the entire argument unsound, even though the conclusion happens to be true. \n\nThe goal of argumentation is to arrive at a truthful conclusion.  An invalid argument fails to achieve this because its conclusion doesn't logically stem from its premises.  A sound argument, on the other hand,  is like an airtight case –  it's structurally sound and built on a foundation of truth,  making its conclusion reliably accurate. \n",
    "Aristotle, that philosophical rockstar, revolutionized the very way we think! Before him, logic was a jumbled mess of ideas.  But Aristotle swooped in and said, \"Hold my toga!\"  He introduced variables, showing that logic wasn't about specific things but about the underlying structures of thought – the universal laws that make arguments tick,  like the mighty modus ponens and modus tollens. \n\nHe didn't stop there.  Aristotle dove headfirst into the heart of logic with his groundbreaking theory of syllogisms. Imagine him,  scroll in hand,  mapping out the different types of arguments, figuring out what makes them work (or not),  and basically creating the rulebook for logical reasoning that we still use today!\n\nWhat blows my mind is that Aristotle was the first to say, \"Hey,  the way we reason? That's a science worth studying!\"  He saw that logic wasn't just a bunch of random thoughts; it was a system,  a way to decode the truth.  He laid the foundation for understanding how we arrive at knowledge,  from the fundamental laws of contradiction to the elegant simplicity of \"if, then\" statements. \n\nFast forward to today, and logic has gone turbocharged with mathematical precision! Modern logic,  while undeniably powerful,  loses a bit of that philosophical charm. It's all about  clean lines,  formal systems, and algorithms. Don't get me wrong,  it's amazing stuff,  especially with its ties to computer science and artificial intelligence.  But sometimes,  I miss the days when logic felt more like a lively debate and less like a computer program.  It's that spark of philosophical wonder that truly ignites my brain! \n",

    "The adversarial criminal justice system, characterized by its presumption of innocence and the equitable application of law across societal strata, presents a compelling framework for adjudicating criminal matters.  However, the inherent structure of this system, designed to safeguard the rights of the accused, raises significant ethical considerations. \n\nBy affording defendants an array of procedural safeguards, including the right to silence, the right to legal counsel, protection against unreasonable searches and seizures, and the right to appeal, the system inherently tilts the balance of power in their favor. While these safeguards are essential for preventing miscarriages of justice,  they can also present challenges for the prosecution, tasked with proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. \n\nThis adversarial framework, while intended to ensure fairness, can devolve into a contest of legal maneuvering rather than a pursuit of truth.  The emphasis on winning, rather than uncovering and presenting facts transparently,  creates a breeding ground for questionable tactics and potential deception, potentially undermining the very justice the system seeks to uphold.  \n\nFurthermore, the ideal of equal justice under the law is often undermined by systemic biases that permeate the American criminal justice system.  Racial disparities in law enforcement practices,  prosecution, and sentencing are well-documented.  Studies by the United States Sentencing Commission reveal that Black men are not only more likely to be arrested for similar offenses compared to their white counterparts but also face significantly longer prison sentences for comparable crimes (Ingraham, 2017). Such disparities expose the deeply rooted prejudices that continue to plague the pursuit of equitable justice. \n\nAddressing these ethical concerns requires a multi-pronged approach.  This includes fostering a culture of transparency in evidence presentation,  promoting implicit bias training within the legal profession, and addressing systemic inequalities in law enforcement practices. By acknowledging and actively dismantling these barriers, we can strive to create a criminal justice system that genuinely upholds the principles of fairness,  equality,  and the pursuit of justice for all. \n",
    "Imagine stepping into a time machine and venturing back thousands of years,  to an era where ideas we now take for granted were revolutionary. That's the allure of exploring Jainism, a philosophy so ancient,  so profoundly different in its worldview, that it challenges our very assumptions about faith and existence.\n\nWhile Sikhism,  with its intriguing blend of monotheism and martial spirit,  captivates with its relatively recent emergence around 500 years ago,  Jainism reaches back nearly 2500 years (Molloy 191).  It's a breathtaking journey into the heart of ancient Indian thought.\n\nWhat's truly captivating about Jainism is its audacious rejection of a Creator God.  Imagine, in a world awash with deities, a belief system that declares the universe self-governing, guided by natural forces rather than divine intervention. This concept, surprisingly resonant with modern atheistic arguments, grapples with timeless questions about perfection, suffering,  and the very nature of existence.  Jainism even dares to pose a logical challenge to creationism: if everything requires a creator,  who then created God? It's a line of inquiry as thought-provoking now as it must have been millennia ago.\n\nBut Jainism isn't just an intellectual exercise; it's a way of life rooted in a deeply ethical core. Five guiding principles,  like pillars supporting a temple of wisdom,  form the foundation of Jainist ethics. Among them,  Ahimsa, the principle of non-violence, shines with a luminous intensity. \n\nIn a world where violence is often justified in the name of faith,  Jainism stands apart,  declaring Ahimsa paramount and unwavering.  This uncompromising stance against harm, extending to all living beings,  resonates deeply in a world grappling with conflict and division. \n\nJainism,  with its ancient roots and radical worldview,  offers a timeless reminder of the power of compassion,  the elegance of a universe governed by natural laws, and the enduring search for truth that transcends time and culture. \n",
    "You know how sometimes you walk into a room and completely misunderstand what's going on? Like,  you think it's a surprise party, but it's actually an intervention for your extreme couponing habit?  Ethnocentrism is kinda like that –  it's when you're so used to your own cultural bubble that you forget other people might have entirely different bubbles, with different rules and maybe even different snacks.\n\nThis book I'm reading explains how folks in some countries go bonkers when an American fast food chain opens up. The author was like, \"Americans don't get it, but it's a huge deal!\" (Noah 188).  And as a proud Canadian, I can totally relate.  We're up here with our Tim Hortons and poutine,  and the thought of freaking out over a burger joint is just, well, un-Canadian. \n\nSpeaking of being Canadian,  let's address the elephant in the igloo –  the whole \"Canadians are too polite\" stereotype.  Sure,  we're big on \"please\" and \"thank you,\"  but trust me,  we've got our share of grumps and under-caffeinated commuters. \n\nThe book also points out this hilarious truth:  one culture's tyrant is another culture's \"meh.\"  Like,  Hitler?  Yeah,  supervillain status in the West.  But in some parts of the world, he's just another historical baddie (Noah 196). \n\nAnd even though Canada hasn't exactly produced any supervillains (unless you count that goose that stole my sandwich last summer),  we've got our share of political drama.  From the outside looking in,  our leaders might seem like paragons of democracy,  but let's just say they're human,  just like everyone else.  They make mistakes, they fight for power, and sometimes,  they even wear mismatched socks.  Gasp!\n\n\n",
    "Globalization, the interconnected flow of information, capital, goods, and ideas across national borders, is reshaping the landscape of business and demanding a new breed of internationally-minded managers.  This interconnectedness creates a world brimming with opportunities,  allowing managers to source materials globally, access diverse talent pools, and tap into new markets (Samson et al., 2020).\n\nHowever,  this global stage presents unique challenges. Managers must navigate cultural differences, political complexities, and potential risks to information security. This necessitates a \"global mindset\" –  the ability to understand, appreciate, and effectively engage with individuals from diverse cultural, social, and political backgrounds (Samson et al., 2020). Without this crucial skill,  effective communication,  collaboration,  and leadership in a globalized world become increasingly difficult. \n\nFurther amplifying the need for a global mindset is the shifting balance of economic power.  Emerging economies like China, India, and Brazil are rapidly ascending the global stage,  challenging the traditional dominance of Western nations.  China,  for instance, has experienced explosive growth, attracting unprecedented foreign investment and witnessing a surge in its number of Fortune Global 500 companies  (Samson et al., 2020).\n\nNavigating this complex terrain are multinational corporations (MNCs),  defined as companies generating over 25% of their revenue from operations outside their home country (Samson et al.,  2020).

Success hinges on a global perspective, viewing the world as one interconnected marketplace rather than a collection of disparate regions.\n\nTo establish a foothold in the global market, companies utilize various strategies:\n\n* **Outsourcing:** Tapping into the global division of labor by shifting specific operations to countries with lower costs for labor and resources (Samson et al., 2020). \n* **Exporting:**  Maintaining production in the home country while shipping finished goods to international markets.\n* **Licensing:** Granting foreign companies the rights to utilize proprietary technology, trademarks, or other intellectual property in exchange for royalties or fees (Samson et al., 2020). \n* **Direct Investing:** Establishing a physical presence in a foreign country,  such as building and managing production facilities.\n\nIn conclusion,  globalization presents both unparalleled opportunities and complex challenges for businesses. Success in this dynamic environment demands a global mindset, adaptability,  and a strategic approach to navigating cultural nuances and leveraging global interconnectedness. \n",
    "This study examined the relationship between a specific message on dining checks and tipping behavior.  The independent variable was the presence of a message promoting upcoming specials,  while the dependent variable was the tip percentage left by customers.  \n\nSeveral factors could potentially influence the results, including food quality, server gender, dining party size, and customer familiarity with the establishment. \n\nThe study's strengths lie in its straightforward design, ease of implementation, and potential for replication across various restaurant settings.  However,  the varying content of the messages,  limited to a single restaurant, introduces potential variability in customer responses and limits the generalizability of the findings.  \n\nFurther investigation is needed to determine whether the personalized nature of the message or the specific content drove the observed changes in tipping.  A control group receiving neutral messages, such as well wishes or simple drawings,  could help isolate the effect of promotional content.  Additionally,  randomly assigning servers to different dining parties, rather than vice versa, could mitigate potential bias.\n\nThe study's internal validity is strengthened by the researchers' efforts to control for server behavior. However,  unobserved variations in server demeanor could still influence tipping,  potentially obscuring the true relationship between the message and tipping behavior.\n\nSeveral hypothetical scenarios highlight potential limitations to the study's external validity:\n\n* **Server Demographics:**  The study's findings may not apply universally across all server demographics.  Future research should consider the potential influence of server age, gender, and other demographic factors on tipping.\n* **Restaurant Type:** The study's focus on a single restaurant type limits the generalizability of findings to other dining contexts, such as high-end restaurants, casual eateries, or buffet-style establishments. \n* **Dining Party Size:**  The study's design does not explicitly address the potential impact of dining party size on tipping behavior.  Including a third group of solo diners could provide insights into the dynamics of individual versus group tipping.  \n\nIncorporating these considerations in future research would enhance the robustness and generalizability of the findings, providing a more nuanced understanding of the complex factors influencing tipping behavior in various dining contexts. \n",
    "The article,  \"Positive leadership psychology: Authentic and servant leadership in higher education in Pakistan,\"  offers a thought-provoking exploration of leadership within the Pakistani educational system. The authors invite us to consider how different leadership styles can shape the learning environment,  particularly the critical role of trust and open communication.\n\nThey argue that a rigid, top-down approach to leadership can stifle the free exchange of ideas and inhibit true collaboration.  Instead, they champion a leadership style grounded in empathy and understanding,  where leaders are attuned to the needs and motivations of those they lead. This emphasis on relationships,  mirroring the principles of servant leadership,  resonates with Bloom's taxonomy of the cognitive domain, particularly the foundational level of knowledge acquisition.\n\nThe authors' thoughtful analysis, presented with clarity and precision, weaves together theoretical insights with practical applications. They delve into the nuances of various leadership styles, exploring how different approaches impact interactions between leaders and followers. Their ultimate conclusion underscores the transformative power of mutual respect and a genuine commitment to understanding individual needs.\n\nThe authors' deep expertise in human resources and leadership psychology is evident throughout their work.  Their impressive publication record,  spanning topics from organizational leadership to culturally-specific leadership practices,  speaks to their profound understanding of this complex field.\n\nThe article's publication in \"Current Psychology,\" a globally respected peer-reviewed journal, further attests to its academic rigor and contribution to the field.  As I reflect on my own discovery of this work within the digital stacks of the Jerry Falwell Library,  I am struck by the timeliness and relevance of its message,  a testament to the enduring power of thoughtful leadership in shaping positive and productive learning environments. \n",
    "The intersection of cosmology and artistic expression reveals profound insights into the cultural values and anxieties of a civilization. A comparative analysis of Christian and Aztec creation narratives,  specifically through the lens of artistic representation,  highlights the stark divergence in their theological frameworks and their approaches to the human condition. \n\n**Christian Cosmology and its Artistic Manifestations:**\n\nChristian cosmology,  as articulated in the Genesis creation narrative,  posits a benevolent, omnipotent God who creates humanity \"in his own image\" (Genesis 1:27, New International Version). This act of creation, occurring within the idyllic Garden of Eden, establishes a paradigm of divine beneficence and human dominion over the natural world.  \n\nConsequently, Christian art often depicts God as a patriarchal figure, characterized by wisdom, authority, and an aged countenance – a visual manifestation of the \"fatherly\" aspect emphasized in biblical texts.  Themes of divine forgiveness, redemption, and the inherent goodness of God's creation permeate artistic representations,  serving to reinforce theological doctrine and provide spiritual comfort to believers.\n\n**Aztec Cosmology and its Artistic Embodiments:**\n\nIn stark contrast, Aztec cosmology presents a world born from primordial chaos and divine sacrifice. The creation myth, centered around the dismemberment of deities,  establishes a fundamental link between creation and violent upheaval. This inherent instability within the cosmic order is reflected in Aztec art,  which frequently depicts deities as awe-inspiring yet fearsome entities,  their iconography imbued with symbols of death,  sacrifice,  and the cyclical nature of life and destruction (National University, 2022).\n\nAztec art, unlike its Christian counterpart,  serves not only as a medium of veneration but also as a visceral reminder of humanity's precarious position within the cosmic order.  The inclusion of receptacles for human hearts within sculptures of deities (National University, 2022) underscores the Aztec belief in the necessity of blood sacrifice to appease the gods and ensure the continuation of life. \n\n**Contrasting Views on Morality and the Afterlife:**\n\nWhile both traditions acknowledge the supremacy of their respective deities, their interpretations of morality and the afterlife diverge significantly. In the Christian worldview,  God embodies absolute good,  while evil is relegated to the realm of Satan,  God's adversary.  Salvation is attained through faith,  repentance,  and adherence to divine law.  Conversely,  Aztec cosmology positions deities beyond conventional notions of good and evil.  Their capricious nature necessitates constant appeasement through ritual sacrifice, a form of transactional exchange to ensure survival and maintain cosmic balance.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe contrasting visual languages employed in Christian and Aztec art reflect fundamentally different approaches to existence.  While Christian art emphasizes themes of divine love, forgiveness, and the promise of eternal life,  Aztec art grapples with the ever-present threat of chaos,  the importance of ritual appeasement, and the precarious nature of human existence.  These contrasting perspectives underscore the profound influence of cultural narratives on artistic expression and the human search for meaning within the vastness of the cosmos. \n",
    "The nursing profession thrives on continuous improvement, constantly adapting to provide the best possible care as healthcare trends and societal needs evolve. A cornerstone of this evolution is evidence-based practice (EBP) – the integration of the latest research findings into daily patient care (Wilson & Austria, 2021). \n\nHowever,  despite its importance, EBP hasn't been fully embraced by all nurses.  Two major roadblocks stand in the way:\n\n1. **Workload and Lack of Resources:** Nurses often face overwhelming workloads, leaving limited time and energy for embracing new practices.  McArthur et al. (2021) highlight the \"physical opportunity\" construct, emphasizing practical barriers like budget constraints, lack of resources,  communication breakdowns, high staff turnover, and insufficient physical guidelines.  These obstacles often force nurses to prioritize immediate tasks over proactive learning and research implementation.\n\n2. **Lack of Organizational Support:** EBP thrives in a culture of collaboration and support. However, many nurses lack the \"social opportunity\" –  meaningful organizational support and strong teamwork –  needed to implement EBP effectively (McArthur et al., 2021). \n\nTo overcome these challenges and pave the way for widespread EBP adoption,  targeted interventions are crucial. Two key areas require attention:\n\n* **Leadership and Education:**  Strong leadership that champions EBP, provides training,  and fosters a culture of inquiry is essential. Imagine a workplace where nurses are encouraged and empowered to seek out the latest research and apply it to their practice.\n* **Access to Resources:** Nurses need easy access to relevant information,  including research databases,  reliable internet connectivity,  and subscriptions to peer-reviewed journals.  This accessibility removes barriers and makes integrating research into daily practice more manageable. \n\nBy addressing these critical areas, we can empower nurses to embrace EBP, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes and a more robust and responsive healthcare system. \n",
    "\"Beowulf,\" widely considered one of the most significant works of early European literature, offers a glimpse into the values and worldview of the Anglo-Saxon culture from which it emerged. While its precise origins remain a subject of scholarly debate, it is often categorized as a Danish poem written in the Anglo-Saxon dialect (Neidorf 847). \n\nThe poem recounts the heroic exploits of Beowulf, a warrior whose feats of strength and courage are presented as divinely ordained (Gummere line 13).  From his early triumph over the monstrous Grendel and Grendel's mother to his final, fatal battle with a fearsome dragon,  Beowulf's life embodies the ideals of heroism and self-sacrifice.\n\nBeyond its epic narrative, \"Beowulf\" explores several enduring themes relevant to the human experience. Identity,  deeply intertwined with ancestry and kinship bonds within the poem's world,  plays a central role in motivating Beowulf's pursuit of glory and recognition. \n\nThe poem also traces Beowulf's growth from a young warrior seeking personal renown to a wise and burdened king, grappling with the responsibilities of leadership and the weight of his people's well-being.  \n\nFurthermore,  \"Beowulf\" navigates the complexities of conflicting value systems. The tension between individual desires and the expectations of the heroic code,  as well as the presence of both Christian and pagan beliefs within the narrative,  highlights the multifaceted nature of human experience and the inherent ambiguities within any fixed set of rules or beliefs.  \n\n\n",
    "Here are the main points of the text, highlighting the enduring relevance of the epic hero Beowulf:\n\n* **Beowulf,  an Anglo-Saxon epic poem,  presents a timeless hero whose courage and unwavering commitment to duty resonate even in the modern era.** \n* **The enduring popularity of superhero stories,  like those featuring Superman in the Marvel universe,  demonstrates our continued fascination with archetypal heroes who embody strength, justice, and selflessness.**\n* **Beowulf and modern superheroes share striking similarities:**\n    * **Superhuman Strength:** Both possess extraordinary abilities that set them apart and enable them to protect the vulnerable.\n    * **Role Models:**  They inspire admiration and serve as examples of courage and moral integrity.\n    * **Confrontation with Evil:**  Their narratives center around confronting powerful enemies whose defeat is crucial for the survival of their communities or the world. \n* **However,  modern audiences demand more complexity from their heroes.** Physical prowess alone is no longer sufficient; heroes must also possess moral purity,  complex motivations, and a relatable human dimension.\n* **The enduring appeal of these ancient stories aligns with postmodernist theory, which emphasizes the reinterpretation and recontextualization of past narratives.**\n* **Ultimately,  the values embodied by Beowulf –  bravery,  loyalty, and a willingness to sacrifice for the greater good –  continue to inspire and shape our understanding of heroism across cultures and throughout time.** \n",
    "The effectiveness of the P-O-L-C (Planning-Organizing-Leading-Controlling) framework relies on several key factors, with communication emerging as a critical element for organizational success.  The 2002 collapse of WorldCom,  a prominent example of corporate malfeasance,  underscores the devastating consequences of communication breakdowns within a company.\n\nWorldCom,  under the leadership of CEO Bernard Ebbers, experienced rapid growth during the telecommunications boom of the late 1990s.  However,  this expansion was fueled by fraudulent accounting practices that ultimately led to the company's downfall. \n\nEbbers and several high-ranking executives faced multiple criminal charges,  including conspiracy, securities fraud,  and filing false statements with regulators.  Ebbers' significant personal financial stake in WorldCom,  including stock holdings, loans,  and loan guarantees,  raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest.\n\nDuring the subsequent legal proceedings,  a pattern of communication failure became apparent.  Executives and accountants offered conflicting testimonies,  with many claiming ignorance of the fraudulent activities.  This lack of transparency and accountability highlights a systemic breakdown in communication within the organization.\n\nResearch indicates that a significant portion of employees often feel their opinions are undervalued or ignored within their workplaces (Knecht, 2020). In the case of WorldCom,  communication barriers, including motive distortion and self-serving biases among top management,  contributed to a culture of misinformation and a lack of cohesive teamwork. \n\nThe prioritization of personal gain over organizational well-being, coupled with selective information sharing,  created an environment ripe for financial misconduct.  The WorldCom case serves as a stark reminder of the crucial role effective communication plays in maintaining ethical conduct,  transparency,  and ultimately,  the long-term viability of an organization. \n",
    "Let's explore the timeless wisdom found within the Bhagavad Gita, an ancient Indian scripture embedded within the epic Mahabharata. This sacred text, dating back to the second half of the first millennium BC,  holds a revered place within Hinduism and offers profound insights into the human condition.\n\n**Setting the Stage:**\n\nImagine a battlefield,  tension thick in the air.  Two massive armies,  the Pandavas and the Kauravas,  stand poised for a clash that will determine the fate of a kingdom.  At the heart of this conflict is Arjuna,  a valiant Pandava prince,  and Krishna, his charioteer and guide, who is also the Supreme God incarnate.\n\n**Key Characters:**\n\n* **Arjuna:**  A skilled warrior,  Arjuna initially embodies traits like pride,  arrogance,  and a thirst for glory. However,  as the narrative unfolds,  he grapples with moral dilemmas and existential questions,  ultimately seeking guidance from Krishna.\n* **Krishna:**  The embodiment of wisdom,  humility,  and divine knowledge,  Krishna patiently guides Arjuna through his inner turmoil,  offering profound insights into the nature of duty,  dharma,  and the pursuit of liberation.\n* **Dhritarashtra and Sanjaya:**  The blind Kaurava king and his wise advisor provide a secondary perspective on the unfolding events,  adding depth and complexity to the narrative.\n\n**The Central Conflict:**\n\nAs the armies prepare for battle,  Arjuna's resolve crumbles. He sees friends,  family,  and respected teachers among his enemies, and the thought of shedding their blood fills him with despair.  He lays down his bow, overwhelmed by doubt and moral anguish.\n\n**Krishna's Guidance:**\n\nThis is where the heart of the Bhagavad Gita lies. Krishna engages Arjuna in a profound philosophical dialogue, addressing his questions about the nature of war,  duty,  morality, and the very purpose of life.  Their conversation delves into timeless themes:\n\n* **The Nature of Duty (Dharma):** Krishna emphasizes the importance of fulfilling one's dharma,  or sacred duty,  even when it involves difficult choices.\n* **The Illusion of Self:** Krishna challenges Arjuna's attachment to his ego and the transient nature of the material world,  guiding him towards a deeper understanding of the true Self.\n* **The Path to Liberation:** Through their dialogue,  Krishna unveils the path to liberation (moksha)  from the cycle of birth and death,  emphasizing the importance of selfless action,  detachment,  and devotion to the divine.\n\n**The Enduring Relevance of the Bhagavad Gita:**\n\nThe Bhagavad Gita transcends its historical context,  offering timeless wisdom that resonates with readers across cultures and throughout time.  It explores fundamental questions about the human experience,  the nature of good and evil,  and the pursuit of a meaningful life.  It's a guidebook for navigating moral dilemmas,  overcoming fear and doubt,  and finding purpose amidst the challenges of life. \n",
    "Imagine growing up in a world where your skin color dictates how people perceive you, where a simple piece of clothing can spark fear or judgment.  That's the reality many face every day, as the TED Talks so powerfully illustrate.\n\nTake, for instance, the story shared by Smith in 2015. He paints a stark picture of the differences between raising a white child and a black child in America, where implicit biases shape experiences from childhood to adulthood.  Then there's Abdel-Magied's 2014 talk,  a poignant reflection on how wearing a hijab instantly transforms how she's treated,  viewed,  and judged.\n\nThese stories are not isolated incidents; they're symptoms of a deeper societal issue –  discrimination rooted in deeply ingrained biases.  A New York Times article from 2016 captured the voices of countless non-white Americans who described feeling excluded,  othered, and judged based on their race. \n\nBias,  that insidious whisper in our minds,  shapes how we perceive and interact with the world.  It can be automatic,  slipping into our subconscious without our awareness. It can be ambiguous,  shifting and morphing depending on the context.  And it can even be ambivalent,  a confusing mix of positive and negative feelings towards a particular group (Fiske, 2022). \n\nWhile I haven't personally experienced the sting of racial discrimination, I've witnessed its impact on people I care about. I've seen how it erodes self-esteem,  chips away at confidence, and leaves lasting scars on the soul. \n\nThat's why I'm compelled to delve deeper into the pervasive nature of racial bias,  particularly how it manifests in the very structures of our society.  It's a story that needs to be told,  understood, and ultimately, rewritten. \n",
    "The documentary \"Coded Bias\" throws open the doors to a unsettling reality:  the algorithms that power facial recognition technology,  a tool increasingly used in law enforcement and beyond,  are riddled with biases,  perpetuating existing societal inequalities.  \n\nThe film unveils the deeply flawed foundations of these systems.  Trained primarily on datasets of white faces,  these algorithms struggle to accurately recognize individuals with darker complexions.  Adding to the problem is the lack of diversity within the tech industry itself,  where predominantly white,  male developers inadvertently bake their own biases into the code.\n\nThis lack of representation translates into real-world consequences,  with people of color disproportionately misidentified,  misjudged,  and even wrongly accused.  The very technology meant to enhance security becomes a tool of oppression,  amplifying existing racial disparities. \n\nAdding to the unease is the opacity surrounding these algorithms. Their inner workings,  the complex processes that lead them to their conclusions,  remain shrouded in secrecy.  This lack of transparency makes it difficult to identify,  challenge,  and ultimately correct the biases embedded within the code. \n\n\"Coded Bias\" offers a glimmer of hope by proposing concrete solutions to address this algorithmic injustice.  The first step is to halt the use of facial recognition in legal proceedings and law enforcement activities until its accuracy and fairness can be guaranteed.  \n\nThe second step involves a multi-faceted approach to improving the technology itself:\n\n* **Diversify the Data:**  Expand the datasets used to train algorithms to include a wider range of faces,  ensuring representation across different races,  genders,  and ages.\n* **Independent Audits:**  Subject algorithms to rigorous,  independent assessments to identify and address biases,  ensuring they meet robust standards of accuracy and fairness.\n\nBy implementing these crucial measures,  we can begin to dismantle the biases woven into facial recognition technology and ensure its responsible and equitable use. \n\nThe film ultimately argues that the future of this technology,  particularly its role in law enforcement,  hinges on our willingness to confront its flaws.  By holding developers accountable,  demanding transparency,  and prioritizing ethical considerations,  we can work towards a future where technology serves justice rather than perpetuating discrimination. \n",
    "The Caribbean's history is a tapestry woven with the threads of colonization,  resistance,  and the enduring legacy of African heritage.  Prior to European arrival, the islands were inhabited by indigenous groups like the Ciboney, Taino Arawak,  and Carib.  However,  the arrival of Spanish colonizers brought with it a brutal system of exploitation,  including the forced enslavement of Africans to work on plantations and in households.\n\nDespite being a minority,  white colonizers seized control of the Caribbean,  imposing their rule over a majority Black population.  However,  the enslaved Africans and their descendants found ways to maintain their cultural identity and express their resistance through various forms of art,  music, and cuisine.\n\nReggae music,  with its roots firmly planted in the Caribbean soil,  became a powerful voice for liberation and a symbol of defiance against oppression.  Legendary artists like Bob Marley and the Wailers gave voice to the struggles and aspirations of the Caribbean people,  their songs echoing with calls for freedom and social justice.\n\nBeyond music,  African traditions remained vibrant in everyday life.  Culinary practices,  religious beliefs,  and festive celebrations like Carnival became powerful expressions of cultural identity.  Dishes like Callaloo,  a flavorful vegetable soup,  continue to be cherished as national dishes in Trinidad and Tobago,  a testament to the enduring legacy of African cuisine. \n\nCarnival,  a vibrant explosion of music,  dance,  and elaborate costumes,  became more than just a celebration;  it evolved into a powerful means of commemorating historical events like slavery and celebrating the resilience of the Caribbean people.  These parades and festivities are a living testament to the rich tapestry of African folklore and customs that continue to thrive in the Caribbean.\n\nDespite the brutal realities of colonial rule,  Black Caribbeans found ways to reclaim their identity,  express their pain,  and celebrate their heritage.  Through the enduring power of music,  food,  and cultural traditions,  they forged a path toward self-determination and ensured that their unique and vibrant culture would continue to thrive. \n",
    "In his essay \"Bowling Alone,\" Robert Putnam argues that America is experiencing a decline in civic engagement, a shift with potentially profound consequences for its social and political landscape.  He observes that Americans are increasingly withdrawing from traditional forms of social interaction,  forsaking the civic-mindedness of previous generations (Putnam 67).\n\nThis decline manifests in various ways, including reduced participation in clubs, community organizations, and even simple acts of neighborliness.  While new mass membership organizations have emerged,  they often lack the personal connection and active involvement that fostered a sense of community in the past.  As Putnam notes,  many members engage only passively,  limiting their participation to paying dues or occasionally reading a newsletter (Putnam 70).\n\nThis trend towards social isolation worries Putnam.  He believes that a vibrant civic life,  characterized by strong community ties and active citizen participation,  has been crucial to America's success.  The erosion of these social bonds, he argues,  could have unpredictable and potentially negative consequences for the nation's future. \n\nPutnam's metaphor of \"bowling alone\" captures the essence of this concern –  a society where individuals are increasingly disconnected,  pursuing their own interests in isolation rather than engaging in collective activities that foster a sense of shared purpose and belonging. \n\n\n",
    "Several factors contribute to the development of breast cancer, with heredity playing a significant role. A family history of breast cancer, particularly among close relatives, increases an individual's risk, even at a younger age (Coleman & Tsongalis, 2016).  \n\nPre-existing breast conditions, such as cystic breast disease, can also elevate the risk of developing breast cancer. These conditions can lead to atypical cell growth within the breast tissue,  potentially increasing the likelihood of malignant transformations (Tkaczuk et al., 2016).\n\nHormonal factors are another critical consideration.  Factors such as late first pregnancy (after age 30),  not breastfeeding, and prolonged use of hormonal contraceptives can disrupt hormonal balance and potentially increase breast cancer risk (Tkaczuk et al., 2016).  As individuals age,  the body's ability to regulate abnormal cellular processes may decline, further contributing to the risk.\n\nMetastasis,  the spread of cancer cells to other parts of the body, is a serious concern. While early-stage breast cancer may not involve metastasis,  aggressive forms of the disease can exhibit early and rapid spread.\n\nDiagnosing and characterizing breast cancer involves various methods:\n\n* **Histological Analysis:** Microscopic examination of breast tissue can determine the type and aggressiveness of the cancer.\n* **Imaging Techniques:** Computed tomography (CT)  and scintigraphy can detect metastatic lesions in organs such as the lungs, liver, bones,  and brain.\n\nIt's crucial to recognize that breast cancer metastases can remain dormant for extended periods,  even years after the removal of the primary tumor. Regular monitoring and follow-up care are essential for early detection and management of potential recurrence. \n",
    "Joseph Campbell's seminal work, \"The Hero with a Thousand Faces,\" delves into the enduring power of mythology and its profound influence on human psychology and culture. In the first chapter, \"Myth and Dream,\" Campbell explores the intricate relationship between these two seemingly disparate realms,  arguing that myths serve as a psychological roadmap, guiding individuals through life's challenges and illuminating the depths of the human psyche.\n\nCampbell's central thesis is encapsulated in his assertion that myths are simultaneously \"dangerous\" and \"fiendishly fascinating\" (Campbell, 2004, p. 7).  Their danger lies in their potential to disrupt the carefully constructed narratives we create about ourselves and the world,  exposing the raw, unfiltered impulses of the subconscious.  Yet, this very disruption holds a captivating allure,  offering a key to unlocking a deeper understanding of ourselves and our place within the universe.\n\nTo support this claim, Campbell draws upon the recurring presence of archetypal figures and motifs from ancient mythology within the dreams of modern individuals.  He argues that dreams,  like myths,  tap into the primal fears, desires, and conflicts that reside within the human subconscious.  Themes of love,  hatred,  jealousy,  and vengeance,  often woven into mythical narratives,  resurface in our dreams,  revealing the complex interplay of emotions and motivations that shape our waking lives.\n\nCampbell illustrates this connection through compelling examples drawn from letters detailing individuals' dream experiences. One man's recurring dream of accidentally killing his father to gain his mother's undivided attention echoes the Oedipal complex,  a prominent theme in mythology.  Another woman's dream encounter with a mythical centaur,  despite no conscious thoughts of infidelity,  suggests a subconscious exploration of primal desires and anxieties. \n\nThese examples highlight the enduring influence of early childhood experiences and their role in shaping our subconscious minds.  Campbell posits that by confronting the often-unsettling imagery and symbolism within our dreams, we can gain valuable insights into the hidden motivations and unresolved conflicts that shape our conscious thoughts and behaviors.  Through this process of self-discovery,  we can begin to integrate the conscious and subconscious aspects of ourselves,  ultimately forging a more complete and authentic understanding of our identity. \n",
    "Recent fad diets demonizing carbohydrates are misleading and potentially harmful. Carbohydrates are essential for a healthy, functioning body. \n\nHere's why ditching carbs is a bad idea:\n\n* **Energy Depletion:** Carbs are the primary fuel source for your brain and nervous system. Eliminating them leads to fatigue,  impaired cognitive function, and potentially even depression.\n* **Weight Fluctuations:** Cutting carbs often leads to initial weight loss, but this is largely due to water loss.  Once you reintroduce carbs,  your body tends to overcompensate, leading to rapid weight gain. \n* **Health Risks:**  Carb restriction can cause headaches,  migraines, and even impair brain function in the long run.  Your brain needs glucose from carbs to operate optimally.\n\nInstead of eliminating carbs,  focus on consuming a balanced diet that includes complex carbohydrates like whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. These provide sustained energy,  essential nutrients,  and support overall health and well-being. \n",

    "Okay, so picture this:  The Rolling Stones,  just starting out,  and there they are,  stuck in the Beatles' mega-huge shadow.  Talk about frustrating,  right?  The Beatles were like the rock royalty,  grabbing all the headlines and breaking records left and right. \n\nSo, the Stones decided to go a different route. They were like, \"If those guys are the good boys of rock,  we're gonna be the bad boys!\" The Beatles, with their neat suits and polite smiles, were all about that clean-cut image.  But the Stones?  They rocked the leather jackets,  grew out their hair, and basically oozed rebellion.  \n\nThe music was different too. The Beatles,  those musical pioneers, even helped give birth to heavy metal with their epic track \"Helter Skelter\" (Covach and Bell 28). The Stones,  while totally influential in their own right,  always seemed to be playing catch-up.  If the Beatles used a sitar in a song,  bam,  the Stones would have one in their next tune. It was a classic case of \"anything you can do, I can do better… or at least differently.\"\n\nThe Beatles' arrival in the US was like a full-blown British invasion! (Covach and Bell 28). They dominated the charts,  even snagging all five top spots on Billboard at one point –  a feat no other band has ever matched! The Stones found success in America too,  but they relied more on shock value to grab attention.  They couldn't quite dethrone the Fab Four. \n\nPeople often saw the Beatles and the Stones as rivals,  like Coke and Pepsi battling for rock 'n' roll supremacy.  Their music was different, their styles were different, and their whole vibe was different. But here's the thing:  they both left an undeniable mark on music.  They inspired countless other bands and became global icons.  And that's a legacy worth celebrating,  rivalry or not. \n",
    "The case of Robert, a twenty-three-year-old male presenting with excessive cleaning rituals and a heightened fear of contamination, strongly suggests a diagnosis of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD).  While he initially sought treatment for anxiety,  his pronounced disinfectant odor,  compulsive handwashing with bleach (up to thirty times daily), and self-reported fear of germs paint a clear picture of OCD symptomology.\n\nThe severity of Robert's condition is evident in the impact it has on his daily life.  The constant handwashing has caused significant skin damage,  yet his fear of contamination overrides the physical discomfort.  Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated his symptoms, leading to extreme measures such as wearing a HAZMAT suit in public.\n\nRobert's social life and work are also significantly affected.  He avoids physical contact with others,  maintains physical distance,  and prefers the isolation of remote work. This social withdrawal,  while offering a temporary reprieve from his anxieties,  reinforces his isolation and potentially hinders his overall well-being.\n\nA multi-pronged treatment approach,  combining behavioral therapy and pharmacological interventions,  is strongly recommended for Robert.  Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), specifically Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP)  and cognitive restructuring,  has proven highly effective in treating OCD (Moody, 2017). \n\nERP involves gradually exposing Robert to feared stimuli (e.g.,  touching surfaces)  while preventing his compulsive response (e.g.,  handwashing). This process helps him to confront his anxieties and learn that the feared consequences do not occur,  ultimately reducing the urge to engage in compulsions. \n\nCognitive restructuring aims to challenge and modify the distorted thoughts that fuel Robert's OCD.  By identifying and reframing these negative thought patterns,  he can develop healthier coping mechanisms and reduce the power of his obsessions.\n\nWhile treatment for OCD can be challenging,  Robert's willingness to seek help and his preference for self-reliance suggest a positive prognosis.  With consistent therapy and potentially medication,  Robert can gain control over his OCD,  reduce his anxiety,  and improve his overall quality of life. \n",
    "Imagine a bustling hospital ward, where nurses navigate the ever-changing landscape of patient care. New technologies emerge, research reveals better practices, and the needs of patients constantly evolve.  For nurses,  adapting to this dynamic environment is not just a choice;  it's a necessity.\n\nTo help nurses navigate the often-turbulent waters of change,  researchers have charted a course using \"change theories.\"  These frameworks provide a compass, guiding teams through the process of implementing new practices and ensuring smooth transitions (Udod & Wagner, 2018).\n\nTwo prominent theories stand out like beacons in the nursing world:  Lewin's change theory and Roger's five-step model. \n\nLewin's theory envisions change as a three-act drama:\n\n* **Unfreezing:** The first act involves shaking things up,  challenging the status quo,  and preparing the team for a new way of doing things. Imagine thawing out a frozen lake,  ready to reshape it.\n* **Change Proper:** The second act is all about action,  putting the new plan into motion, and learning the new steps of this intricate dance. \n* **Refreezing:**  The final act solidifies the change,  making it the new normal,  a frozen landscape ready to be navigated with confidence (Udod & Wagner, 2018).\n\nRoger's five-step model takes a more collaborative approach,  focusing on winning hearts and minds:\n\n* **Knowledge is Power:**  Start by gathering evidence,  building a solid case for change. \n* **Listen Up:**  Engage the nursing team,  seek their feedback, and address their concerns.\n* **Test Drive:** Conduct a pilot study,  a trial run to gather data and fine-tune the approach.\n* **Ready, Set, Change!**  Roll out the new practice with confidence,  knowing it's been thoroughly vetted. \n* **Check the Results:** Evaluate the impact,  gather data,  and make any necessary adjustments (Udod & Wagner, 2018). \n\nFor my capstone project,  Roger's five-step model feels like the perfect fit.  It aligns beautifully with my goal of showing how EBP training can boost nurses' self-esteem and improve patient satisfaction.  Gathering data,  getting feedback,  and running a pilot study are all crucial steps in building a compelling case for change. \n\nPlus,  my preceptor has already used Roger's model to successfully implement changes to the staff's scheduling.  If it worked for her,  it can work for me!  \n\n\n",
    "The distinction between a mere manager and a true leader is profound,  hinging on their understanding of the human element within any organization. While a manager may prioritize financial metrics and operational efficiency,  a true leader recognizes that the heart of any enterprise lies in its people.\n\nA great leader cultivates an environment where individuals feel valued,  supported,  and empowered to reach their full potential. They see beyond job titles and bottom lines,  recognizing the unique talents and aspirations of each team member. This approach fosters not only individual growth but also a shared sense of purpose and commitment to a common goal. \n\nConversely,  a flawed leader can inflict significant damage upon an organization and its people.  Their actions, often driven by self-interest,  short-sightedness, or a lack of empathy,  create a toxic atmosphere that stifles innovation,  erodes morale,  and ultimately undermines success. \n\nWhile it's crucial to avoid generalizations and base judgments on verifiable evidence,  statistics and real-world examples suggest that unethical leadership is,  unfortunately,  not uncommon.  The case of Jack Ma,  founder of the e-commerce giant Alibaba,  has drawn criticism for alleged labor exploitation within its supply chains. Reports of underage workers in developing countries producing goods for Alibaba raise serious ethical concerns,  suggesting a prioritization of profit over human well-being. \n\nThis example underscores a fundamental flaw in unethical leadership:  a lack of empathy and humanism.  Individuals are reduced to mere resources, their value measured solely in terms of their productivity and cost-effectiveness.  This myopic perspective ignores the intrinsic worth of each person,  creating a dehumanizing environment where exploitation thrives.\n\nThe consequences of such leadership are far-reaching.  Talent is stifled,  innovation is hampered,  and a culture of fear and distrust takes root.  Moreover,  ethical breaches,  even if initially hidden,  inevitably surface,  damaging the organization's reputation and undermining its long-term viability.\n\nThe true path to sustainable success lies in embracing a leadership philosophy grounded in respect,  empathy,  and a genuine commitment to the well-being of all stakeholders.  By fostering a culture of collaboration,  empowerment,  and ethical conduct,  leaders can unlock the full potential of their organizations and create a positive impact that extends far beyond the bottom line. \n",
    "A well-crafted contract is essential for any organization, ensuring clarity, establishing obligations, and fostering trust between parties.  Charles Schwab, a leading provider of banking and brokerage services, exemplifies this principle through its comprehensive user agreement. \n\nThe Schwab account agreement demonstrates a clear understanding of the core elements required for a legally sound and effective contract (Reder et al., 2021). From the outset, the agreement establishes a foundation of transparency by meticulously defining key terms and concepts,  ensuring both Schwab and its clients have a shared understanding of the agreement's scope.\n\nThis commitment to clarity extends to the crucial elements of offer,  acceptance,  and legality. The agreement outlines the terms of service, the process for client consent, and the legal framework governing the relationship,  leaving no room for ambiguity.  This transparent approach fosters trust and facilitates a smoother, more collaborative partnership (Templin, 2017).\n\nFurthermore, the agreement addresses the essential element of consideration,  clearly outlining the rights and responsibilities of both parties. For instance, the contract explicitly states that Schwab is not responsible for monitoring individual trading activities (\"Schwab account agreement,\" 2022), effectively defining the boundaries of their service and managing client expectations.\n\nBy meticulously outlining these key elements,  Schwab's brokerage agreement empowers clients to make informed decisions,  fully understand the services they are receiving, and recognize their own obligations within the agreement.  This meticulous approach to contract development serves as a model for other organizations, demonstrating the importance of clarity, transparency, and a well-defined framework for mutual understanding and successful collaboration.  \n",
    "Primary sources provide direct evidence about an event or phenomenon, such as diaries, photographs, interviews, and statistical data. They offer firsthand accounts and unfiltered information, allowing researchers to immerse themselves in the context of the subject under investigation. Examples for a Chernobyl disaster study would include reports, photographs, and witness interviews from that time.\n\nSecondary sources, like books, reviews, and articles, offer interpretations and analyses of primary sources. They provide valuable context, synthesis, and diverse perspectives on the topic.\n\nConsulting a variety of both primary and secondary sources is crucial for robust historical research.

    "The development of both the Chesapeake and Middle colonies reveals how deeply intertwined slavery became with the very fabric of colonial society.  In the Chesapeake,  the pursuit of profit through cash crops like tobacco fueled an insatiable demand for labor. While indentured servitude initially filled this need, the system's inherent limitations,  particularly the finite term of service, proved unsustainable.  \n\nThe Chesapeake colonists faced a stark reality:  failure to cultivate and harvest their crops meant economic ruin and even starvation (Kidd, 2019).  This desperation created a fertile ground for the expansion of slavery,  a system that provided a seemingly endless supply of labor with no expiration date.  Slavery,  once established,  rapidly became entrenched,  transforming the social,  economic,  and political landscape of the region. \n\nThe Middle colonies,  despite their initial Quaker influence and emphasis on pacifism,  also succumbed to the allure of enslaved labor.  Although their agricultural practices were more diverse than the Chesapeake's, the demand for a workforce to support colonial development remained.  With limited European immigration,  slavery emerged as a solution to the labor shortage,  paving the way for economic expansion (Huntley, 2019).\n\nThe parallel embrace of slavery in both regions highlights a disturbing truth about colonial attitudes.  The colonists,  driven by economic ambition and a belief in their own superiority,  readily embraced the exploitation of enslaved Africans as a means to an end.  This shared acceptance of slavery as an economic engine,  particularly within the agricultural sector,  underscores the tragic and dehumanizing foundation upon which these colonies were built. \n",
    "These writings offer a heartfelt exploration of the profound ways in which the Christian worldview can enrich and inspire the pursuit of knowledge,  particularly within the realm of Liberal Arts. \n\nDaniel Spanjer, in his insightful work,  highlights the unique perspective that Christianity brings to understanding the human condition.  We are not merely products of the natural world,  he argues, but beings endowed with the extraordinary gifts of feeling and thought,  capabilities that point to a reality beyond the purely material (Spanjer 3).  This understanding,  he suggests,  should guide our pursuit of knowledge,  motivating us to explore the vast spectrum of human experience,  from the logical to the transcendent.\n\nSpanjer introduces the concept of \"worldview\" as a framework for integrating learning,  scholarship,  experience,  and knowledge into a cohesive whole (Spanjer 15). While different perspectives and interpretations may arise,  the ongoing pursuit of truth,  guided by faith and reason,  allows us to refine our understanding and discard falsehoods over time.\n\nBrad Green,  in his compelling chapter,  explores the sacred connection between language and faith.  He argues that language,  when infused with transcendent meaning and purpose,  possesses a unique power and beauty. However,  when stripped of its connection to the divine,  language becomes hollow and loses its ability to inspire and transform (Green).\n\nGreen reminds us that words themselves are a divine gift,  a means through which God reveals Himself to humanity and shapes our understanding of ourselves and the world.  By embracing the truths revealed in Scripture and aligning our words with God's will,  we can unlock the full potential of language and use it to spread love,  hope,  and understanding. \n\nDavid Dockery,  in his passionate call for a faith-centered approach to education,  encourages us to view learning through a Christian lens. By grounding our thoughts and beliefs in the teachings of Christ, we can sanctify our pursuit of knowledge and use it to serve others and contribute to the betterment of society (Dockery 4, 8).\n\nDockery envisions a revitalization of higher education,  where thoughtful believers,  guided by their faith,  lead the way in promoting a culture of compassion,  service,  and intellectual exploration. He reminds us that a Christian worldview,  far from limiting our intellectual horizons,  provides a solid foundation for a meaningful and transformative educational journey. \n\n\n",
    "Let's break down the complex topic of end-stage kidney damage,  drawing upon reputable sources like the \"Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation\" (NDT) journal and the National Center for Biotechnological Information (NCBI). \n\n**Understanding End-Stage Kidney Damage:**\n\nEnd-stage kidney damage, also known as end-stage renal disease (ESRD),  marks the final stage of chronic kidney failure.  At this point,  the kidneys have lost almost all functionality,  posing a serious threat to a person's health and survival.\n\n**Progression of Chronic Kidney Failure:**\n\nChronic kidney failure typically progresses through several stages:\n\n1. **Early Stage:**  Reduced urine output (diuresis)  is the initial sign.\n2. **Stage 2:**  Nausea and increased urine production develop as the kidneys struggle to filter waste products.\n3. **Stage 3:**  Fluid retention and decreased urine output signal worsening kidney function.\n4. **End-Stage:** The kidneys fail completely, leading to a buildup of toxins in the blood and a range of severe symptoms.\n\n**Prevalence and Impact:**\n\nChronic kidney failure affects a significant portion of the population,  with estimates ranging from 200 to 500 cases per million people.  Alarmingly,  the number of individuals with chronic kidney failure is increasing by 10-12% annually. \n\nEnd-stage renal disease severely impacts a person's quality of life.  Diuresis often ceases completely, and complications like pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs) can develop.  The global prevalence of ESRD is estimated at 759 cases per million population,  while the incidence rate (new cases)  averages around 144 per million.  Although mortality rates have decreased,  ESRD remains a serious condition with a mortality rate of approximately 28%. \n\n**Diagnosis and Treatment:**\n\nDiagnosing end-stage kidney damage involves:\n\n* **Blood Tests:**  Measuring creatinine,  potassium,  and urea levels to assess kidney function.\n* **Ultrasound:**  Visualizing the kidneys to identify structural abnormalities.\n* **Additional Tests:**  Catheterization of the renal pelvis and angiography may be performed to gather more detailed information.\n\nTreatment for end-stage kidney damage typically involves medication,  dialysis (a process to filter the blood),  and in some cases,  kidney transplantation.  \n\n**The Importance of Research:**\n\nThe NDT journal,  endorsed by the European Renal Association (ERA),  plays a crucial role in disseminating cutting-edge research on dialysis,  transplantation,  and nephrology.  The NCBI,  a repository for scientifically validated research,  provides access to vital information on the causes,  treatment,  and management of ESRD.\n\nOngoing research is essential for improving outcomes for individuals with end-stage kidney damage.  Scientists are exploring new dialysis techniques,  developing innovative medications,  and refining transplantation procedures to enhance quality of life and extend survival for those affected by this challenging condition. \n",
    "Behind the spectacle of performing animals— elephants gracefully waltzing, sea lions juggling with effortless charm, bears pedaling bicycles, and tigers leaping through fiery hoops—lies a darker reality,  one that animal rights activists are increasingly bringing to light.  While these acts may elicit gasps of wonder and delight,  particularly from young audiences, they represent a fundamental violation of the animals' inherent rights and well-being.\n\nFor decades, a growing movement has sought to expose the cruelty inherent within the training and confinement of wild animals for entertainment. International agreements recognize animals as sentient beings,  capable of experiencing a range of emotions,  from joy and playfulness to fear and suffering (Marino 148).  The unnatural behaviors forced upon them in the circus stand in stark contrast to these inherent rights. \n\nThe meticulously choreographed routines,  far from being a testament to animal intelligence,  are often the result of coercive training methods.  Deprivation,  punishment, and the relentless pursuit of a meager reward become the tools for shaping these unnatural performances (Arnold-Foster 146).  Imagine a majestic lion, reduced to a shadow of its former self,  performing out of desperation rather than a genuine desire to entertain.\n\nThe romantic notion of \"animal performers\" masks a tragic truth.  Unlike human actors who choose their profession,  animals are forcibly conscripted into a life of confinement and exploitation.  The vast majority of their existence is spent in cramped cages,  often too small to allow them to stand upright or turn around (Ward 131).  These intelligent,  social creatures are deprived of their natural instincts,  their freedom to roam,  and the rich tapestry of behaviors that define their species. \n\nIn a world increasingly aware of animal sentience and ethical responsibility,  the continuation of animal circuses becomes increasingly untenable.  Restricting or banning these practices is not merely a matter of sentimentality but a moral imperative. We must acknowledge that animals deserve to live according to their nature,  free from exploitation and the cruel confines of a life designed solely for human amusement.  \n\nBy choosing to support entertainment that respects animal well-being,  we send a powerful message that compassion,  not cruelty,  should be the guiding principle in our interactions with the animal kingdom. \n\n\n",
    "Esteemed colleagues, \n\nToday, I wish to illuminate the profound implications of the Commitment to Health Theory, a model crucial for understanding and promoting positive health behaviors.\n\nAt its core, this theory posits that individuals progress through distinct stages in their journey towards embracing a healthier lifestyle.  It recognizes that internal motivation,  coupled with a willingness to overcome potential obstacles,  is paramount for achieving lasting change (Kelly, 2014). \n\nSignificantly, this theory transcends demographic boundaries,  affirming that the pursuit of health is a universal aspiration,  unconstrained by factors such as gender,  race, or socioeconomic status.\n\nIn her seminal work,  Kelly (2008) draws upon the principles of the Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change, a framework that elucidates the stages of transformation individuals undergo.  The Commitment to Health Theory,  in turn,  integrates key tenets of this model, including stages of change, decisional balance, and self-efficacy (Prochaska & Velicer, 1997),  creating a powerful synergy for understanding and facilitating behavioral change.\n\nThe implications for advanced nursing practice are profound.  This model empowers healthcare professionals to assess patients' readiness for change,  tailor interventions to their specific stage, and guide them towards a healthier future.\n\nFor example, in the initial stage,  the emphasis lies on building rapport,  instilling confidence,  and highlighting the benefits of positive change. As the patient progresses to the second stage,  strategies are implemented to strengthen their resolve and equip them with the tools necessary for successful transformation. The final stage focuses on solidifying new behavioral patterns and ensuring long-term adherence to a healthy lifestyle.\n\nIn essence,  by utilizing the stages of change and commitment ratings,  healthcare providers can personalize their approach,  employing stage-specific strategies and motivational communication techniques to empower patients on their path towards optimal well-being. This theory provides a valuable roadmap, guiding both patients and practitioners towards a shared destination of improved health outcomes. \n",
    "Here's a valuable lesson I've learned about success in healthcare:  while technical expertise is essential,  the ability to build strong, trusting relationships with patients is equally crucial.  \n\nAllow me to share my observations of Dr. Wang, a skilled eye surgeon who exemplifies this principle.  What struck me most about Dr. Wang wasn't just their surgical expertise but their remarkable ability to connect with patients on a personal level.  Here are some key takeaways from observing Dr. Wang's approach:\n\n**1. Active Listening:** Dr. Wang creates a safe space for patients to express themselves fully. They listen attentively,  without interruption, allowing patients to share their symptoms,  concerns, and feelings openly.\n\n**2. Consistent Politeness and Patience:** Regardless of their workload or mood,  Dr. Wang treats every patient with courtesy and respect.  Their patience creates a calming atmosphere,  putting even the most anxious patients at ease.\n\n**3. Genuine Interest in Patients' Well-being:** Dr. Wang goes beyond treating medical conditions;  they demonstrate a genuine interest in their patients' lives.  They remember details from previous visits,  ask about family members, and create a sense of connection that extends beyond the clinical setting. \n\nThe impact of Dr. Wang's approach is undeniable.  Patients feel comfortable sharing their concerns openly, leading to more accurate diagnoses and effective treatment plans.  Moreover, the trust and rapport built through these interactions fosters a sense of partnership between doctor and patient,  creating a more positive and supportive healthcare experience.\n\nInspired by Dr. Wang's example, I'm committed to cultivating these essential communication skills in my own practice. I believe that strong doctor-patient relationships are the foundation of high-quality care,  leading to better outcomes and a more humane healthcare system. \n\nI encourage all aspiring and current healthcare professionals to prioritize the development of their communication and interpersonal skills.  By embracing empathy, active listening,  and genuine care for our patients,  we can elevate the practice of medicine and create a more compassionate and effective healthcare experience for all. \n",
    "The availability and accessibility of healthy food choices are crucial social determinants of health,  significantly impacting the dietary habits and overall well-being of communities.  A case study examining the Forest Park, Illinois location of a Walmart supermarket reveals concerning trends in food access and affordability within the surrounding community of Maywood, IL 60153. \n\n**Limited Access to Nutritious Options:**\n\nA survey of grocery prices at the Walmart store reveals a concerning affordability gap between healthy and less nutritious options.  While a gallon of milk is priced at $2.65 and a bag of apples at $3.58,  a 2-liter bottle of soda costs $1.98 and a family-size pack of cookies is $3.98.  This price disparity,  coupled with a documented scarcity of quality grocery stores in Maywood,  suggests that residents may face significant barriers to accessing affordable,  nutritious food.\n\n**Socioeconomic Factors and Health Outcomes:**\n\nMaywood's demographic profile reveals a predominantly African American population (68.6%),  with white (18.2%)  and Hispanic/Latino (26.9%)  residents comprising the remaining demographics (United States Census Bureau,  n.d.).  The median household income in the area is approximately $50,176,  with a poverty rate of 15%  (United States Census Bureau,  n.d.).  \n\nThese socioeconomic factors,  combined with limited access to healthy food options and an increase in fast-food establishments,  contribute to a higher risk of diet-related health issues,  including hypertension and diabetes (Islam, 2019).  The intersection of inadequate transportation,  low income,  and restricted food choices creates a complex web of challenges for residents seeking to improve their dietary habits.\n\n**The Role of Community Health Nurses:**\n\nCommunity health nurses (CHNs)  play a vital role in addressing food insecurity and promoting public health.  Effective interventions require a multi-pronged approach,  encompassing collaboration,  community engagement,  and a focus on systems-level change.\n\nSchffer and Strohschein (2019)  propose a framework of 17 interventions, categorized into five groups,  emphasizing the importance of collaborative partnerships to achieve sustainable improvements in food security.  These interventions prioritize strong commitment,  shared goals,  and active participation from all stakeholders.  \n\nBy engaging with community members,  local organizations,  and policymakers,  CHNs can effectively address the complex interplay of social, economic,  and environmental factors that contribute to food insecurity,  empowering individuals and communities to make healthier choices and improve their overall well-being. \n",
    "The debate surrounding Confederate statues in the United States is not merely about preserving history; it's a battleground for confronting the enduring legacy of racism and white supremacy. While some, including former President Donald Trump,  argue for their preservation as historical symbols, a growing chorus of voices demands their removal,  recognizing them as monuments to a deeply flawed and oppressive past.\n\nThe timing of these statues' erection exposes their true purpose.  Contrary to claims of commemorating fallen soldiers,  the majority of Confederate monuments were not erected immediately after the Civil War. Instead,  two distinct waves of construction reveal a more sinister agenda:\n\n* **1900s-1920s:**  This period,  marked by the rise of Jim Crow laws and the systematic disenfranchisement of Black Americans,  saw a surge in Confederate monument construction,  largely spearheaded by the United Daughters of the Confederacy. This organization,  driven by a white supremacist ideology,  sought to rewrite history,  glorifying the Confederacy and perpetuating a narrative of racial hierarchy.\n* **1950s-1960s:**  The second wave coincided with the Civil Rights Movement and Black Americans' courageous fight against segregation and racial terror.  The erection of these monuments during this era served as a defiant backlash against progress,  a blatant attempt to reinforce white dominance amidst calls for racial equality.\n\nThe strategic placement of these monuments, often on courthouse grounds, further reinforces their connection to the enforcement of white supremacy. They stood as stark reminders of the legal system's role in upholding racial segregation and denying Black citizens their fundamental rights.\n\nThe undeniable link between Confederate statues and the systemic oppression of Black Americans has spurred a movement for their removal or relocation.  This is not about erasing history but about confronting a painful past and refusing to celebrate symbols of hate and division.\n\nWhile remembering past mistakes is crucial for preventing their recurrence,  it's equally important to recognize that some symbols are so deeply intertwined with oppression that their continued presence perpetuates harm.  Removing Confederate statues is a necessary step towards creating a more just and equitable society,  one that honors the struggles of those who fought for freedom and equality and rejects the glorification of a past rooted in white supremacy. \n\n\n",
    "Conflict, like a persistent shadow,  is an inevitable companion in the journey of human interaction.  Within the demanding environment of healthcare,  where physical,  mental, and ethical complexities converge,  conflict becomes an even more potent force,  demanding careful navigation and skillful resolution.\n\nIgnoring or mishandling conflicts within healthcare settings can have a ripple effect,  diminishing staff morale,  increasing stress levels,  and ultimately compromising the quality of patient care (McKibben, 2017; Suifan, Alhyari, & Sweis, 2020).  Understanding the root causes of these conflicts is the first step towards effectively managing them and fostering a harmonious work environment.\n\nThink of conflict as a tangled knot,  its strands representing a complex interplay of individual,  interpersonal,  and organizational factors:\n\n**Individual Factors:** Each person brings their unique baggage to the workplace –  self-esteem,  emotional intelligence,  communication styles,  and even personal worldviews (Kim et al., 2017).  These internal landscapes can significantly influence how individuals perceive and respond to conflict.  Even factors like professional experience,  age,  and licensing levels can shape conflict dynamics (Chang, Chen, & Chen, 2017).\n\n**Interpersonal Factors:**  Conflicts often arise from strained relationships,  lack of trust or respect,  power imbalances,  and communication breakdowns (Kim et al.,  2017).  Imagine two colleagues,  their communication styles clashing like cymbals,  their differing perspectives creating a chasm of misunderstanding.\n\n**Organizational Factors:** The very structure of an organization can breed conflict.  Ambiguous roles,  unclear hierarchies,  and poorly defined responsibilities can create a breeding ground for frustration and disputes (Kim et al., 2017; McKibben, 2017).  Imagine a team working on a project with overlapping tasks and unclear leadership,  a recipe for conflict.\n\nReflecting on my own experiences,  I can see how these factors play out in real-life scenarios.  A friend's self-centeredness often leads to friction, as his need to control situations overrides others' opinions.  My own struggles with emotional regulation have, at times,  fueled conflicts with loved ones.  And even a seemingly simple group project can descend into chaos when roles and responsibilities are not clearly defined.\n\nRecognizing these intricate dynamics, both within ourselves and our organizations, is the first step towards untangling the knot of conflict and creating a more harmonious and productive work environment. \n",
    "Imagine a person who embodies the very best of humanity –  wise, compassionate, and dedicated to living a life of purpose and virtue.  In both Confucianism and Plato's philosophy, we find archetypes that embody this ideal:  the Confucian \"junzi,\" or noble person,  and Plato's \"philosopher-king.\"  \n\nIn Confucian thought,  the junzi is a person who strives for excellence in all aspects of life.  They are guided by strong moral principles,  always seeking to do what is right and just,  even when it's difficult (Yu-kit 223). They recognize the darkness in the world but choose to rise above it,  leading by example and inspiring others to do the same (Yu-kit 225). \n\nThe junzi is not just a model citizen;  they are also a teacher,  sharing their wisdom and knowledge to help others cultivate their own virtue (Yu-kit 223, 224).  Think of them as a mentor,  guiding others toward a path of self-improvement and ethical living.\n\nPlato's philosopher-king shares a similar commitment to virtue and wisdom.  This ideal ruler is not driven by power or ambition but by a deep love for knowledge and a desire to create a just and harmonious society (Mark). They are humble,  rational,  and dedicated to using their wisdom to guide and uplift others. \n\nWhile both archetypes emphasize moral excellence,  there are subtle differences in their focus.  The philosopher-king,  with their emphasis on knowledge and leadership,  is more of a wise ruler,  while the Confucian junzi is more of an ethical role model,  living a life of virtue and inspiring others through their actions.\n\nDespite these differences,  both the junzi and the philosopher-king represent timeless ideals that continue to inspire us. They remind us that true fulfillment comes from striving for excellence,  embracing compassion and wisdom,  and using our gifts to make the world a better place. \n\n\n",
    "The inevitability of World War II is a widely accepted notion, both in retrospect and for many who lived through the tumultuous 1930s.  While some speculate that the United States could have intervened to prevent the conflict,  a closer examination reveals the complexities and limitations that would have made such intervention highly improbable.\n\nAmerican foreign policy during the 1930s was characterized by isolationism.  The nation, grappling with the Great Depression and facing internal anxieties about the spread of communist ideology,  prioritized domestic concerns (Corbett et al., 2021; Russett, 2019).  Furthermore, the United States,  while a growing power,  had not yet reached the economic and military dominance it would later achieve. Its ability to exert significant influence on European affairs was limited.\n\nThe seeds of World War II were sown in the aftermath of World War I. The Treaty of Versailles,  while intended to establish lasting peace,  created a volatile landscape of resentment and instability.  Germany,  burdened by crippling reparations and territorial losses,  became a breeding ground for extremist ideologies.  \n\nThe rise of aggressive regimes in Europe –  Nazi Germany,  Fascist Italy,  and the expansionist Soviet Union –  created a tinderbox ripe for conflict.  The complex web of alliances and national ambitions made it virtually impossible for any single nation to avert the impending war.\n\nEven if the United States had abandoned its isolationist stance,  it's unlikely that it could have single-handedly prevented the outbreak of war.  The forces driving the conflict were deeply entrenched within Europe,  fueled by a complex interplay of historical grievances,  ideological clashes,  and unchecked aggression.\n\nWhile the United States could not have averted World War II, its eventual entry into the conflict proved decisive in securing Allied victory and shaping the postwar world order.  The nation's contributions, both militarily and economically,  played a pivotal role in defeating the Axis powers and establishing a new era of international cooperation. \n",
    "This paper explores Fauteux's (2021)  insightful article,  \"COVID-19: Impact on Nurses and Nursing,\"  examining its structure and key findings.  While the abstract provides a concise overview of the topic,  it could benefit from including a glimpse into the research methods and key results,  offering a more comprehensive preview for readers. \n\nThe introduction, however,  shines in its thoroughness,  painting a vivid picture of the pandemic's profound impact on the nursing profession.  The inclusion of relevant statistics adds depth and weight to the narrative, making the challenges faced by nurses during this unprecedented time more tangible.  Through this introduction,  we gain a clear understanding of the multifaceted ways in which COVID-19 has reshaped nursing,  from increased mortality rates and shifting work practices to the immense burden of increased workloads.\n\nThe research method employed by Fauteux is a qualitative analysis,  synthesizing a wealth of existing research to draw insightful conclusions about the evolving nature of nursing.  By skillfully weaving together quantitative data and previously analyzed information,  the study illuminates the key transformations within the profession.\n\nAmong the study's most compelling findings are the acceleration of collaboration and innovation,  the dismantling of traditional practice barriers,  the rapid rise of telemedicine,  and the concerning increase in nurse burnout (Fauteux,  2021).  \n\nThis article offers a valuable lens for understanding the resilience and adaptability of nurses in the face of extraordinary challenges.  The insights into the growing prevalence of telemedicine and the heightened risk of burnout,  in particular,  underscore the profound and lasting ways in which the pandemic has reshaped the healthcare landscape and the experiences of those on the front lines.  Fauteux's work provides a crucial foundation for future research and policy decisions,  helping to address the challenges and harness the opportunities that lie ahead for the nursing profession. \n",
    "Culture,  the intricate tapestry of social norms,  behaviors, and customs that define a society,  exerts a profound influence on leadership styles and effectiveness.  While leadership transcends national boundaries,  its expression is shaped by the cultural context in which it operates.\n\nOne key cultural dimension impacting leadership is the perception of time.  Middle Eastern cultures, often characterized as past-oriented and tradition-bound, contrast sharply with the future-focused, change-embracing mindset prevalent in many Western cultures,  particularly the United States (Beehner 72).  This difference is exemplified by leaders like Barack Obama,  whose message of change resonated deeply within the American context.\n\nFurther evidence of culture's impact on leadership is highlighted in a study by Crede et al. (2023)  examining the relationship between transformational leadership and cultural values.  Their findings reveal a striking correlation:  transformational leadership is more strongly associated with subordinate performance in cultures with lower levels of gender egalitarianism (Crede et al. 23).  This suggests that in more traditional cultures,  where hierarchical structures and gender roles are more pronounced,  transformational leadership styles may be more effective.\n\nThese examples underscore the undeniable influence of culture on leadership behaviors.  Culture not only distinguishes one social group from another but also shapes the likelihood of change initiatives succeeding,  particularly those driven by individuals in positions of authority.  Leaders,  as key decision-makers within their societies,  operate within the framework of cultural norms and expectations,  their effectiveness often hinging on their ability to align their leadership style with the prevailing cultural values. \n\nTherefore,  a comprehensive understanding of culture must encompass its impact on leadership. Recognizing the interplay between cultural norms and leadership styles is essential for fostering effective leadership,  promoting cross-cultural understanding,  and navigating the complexities of our increasingly interconnected world. \n",
    "The formation of states is a complex and multifaceted process, influenced by a myriad of factors, including the strategic deployment of cultural power.  Social agents,  particularly those involved in shaping public discourse and disseminating cultural narratives,  play a pivotal role in this process.  Their influence is particularly evident in the formation of alliances,  the establishment of dominance hierarchies,  and the construction of shared identities.  \n\nTo understand the emergence of states in diverse contexts,  such as Western Europe,  China, the Islamic World,  and India,  a nuanced understanding of the concept of \"social strategies of power\" is essential.  These strategies encompass the deliberate use of cultural influence,  often through mass media and other forms of public communication,  to shape public opinion and legitimize political authority.\n\nGledhill argues that the defining characteristic distinguishing state societies from stateless societies lies in the centralization of power.  In stateless societies,  the absence of centralized authority often results in decentralized power structures,  leading to greater social equality and a lack of formalized citizenship. Conversely,  state societies are characterized by a concentration of power,  leading to the establishment of hierarchical structures and the formalization of citizenship.\n\nTherefore, to fully comprehend the rise of states in the aforementioned regions,  it is imperative to examine the role of social strategies of power.  These strategies,  deployed by those in positions of authority,  shape public perception,  foster a sense of collective identity,  and ultimately contribute to the legitimization and consolidation of state power.\n\nIn Chapter 3, the author departs from traditional Eurocentric perspectives on state formation,  emphasizing the crucial role of social anthropology and cultural factors.  Alongside political and economic forces,  social influence,  exercised through the strategic actions of social agents,  plays a significant role in shaping public opinion and constructing narratives that support the emergence and consolidation of state power.\n\nThis analysis reveals a clear correlation between the formation of states in Western Europe,  China,  the Islamic World,  and India and the deployment of social strategies of power.  By understanding these dynamics,  we gain a deeper appreciation for the complex interplay of social, cultural,  political,  and economic forces that shape the historical trajectory of nations. \n",
    "Advancements in personal computer technology have necessitated the development of increasingly sophisticated hardware and software architectures.  Central to these advancements is the evolution of buses,  the communication pathways that facilitate data exchange between various internal components and peripheral devices. \n\nThree primary types of buses are integral to computer systems:  address, control,  and data buses (Farret et al.,  2017). Data buses, specifically,  serve as the conduits for information flow between the central processing unit (CPU) and peripherals.  The address bus enables the CPU to locate specific data within memory,  while the control bus governs data processing operations.\n\nData buses are characterized by their width,  typically expressed as a power of two, with common variations including 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64-bit architectures (Farret et al.,  2017).  Bus width dictates the number of bits of data that can be transmitted simultaneously,  with wider buses facilitating higher data throughput.\n\nThe number of parallel lines within a processor,  representing the physical connections for electrical signal exchange between the CPU and peripherals,  directly correlates with bus width.  Contemporary computers predominantly utilize 32-bit and 64-bit microprocessors. A 32-bit data bus comprises thirty-two parallel lines,  while a 64-bit data bus incorporates sixty-four lines,  enabling a twofold increase in data transfer capacity (Farret et al.,  2017).  \n\nConsequently,  the primary distinction between these architectures lies in their data processing speeds.  Similarly,  the performance of earlier bus architectures is directly proportional to the number of parallel copper wires connecting the CPU to other internal components. \n\nWhile all buses serve the fundamental function of data exchange, their structural variations,  particularly bus width,  result in significant differences in data transfer rates and overall system performance. \n\n\n",
    "Data science, the study of digital data's lifecycle,  involves analyzing vast amounts of information to generate practical insights.  However, Os Keyes critiques this field, arguing that it reduces human complexity to quantifiable data points,  effectively dehumanizing individuals.  Keyes suggests that data science systems, in their pursuit of objective measurement,  neglect the nuances of human experience and risk excluding individual perspectives.\n\nStandardized tests exemplify this concern.  Their multiple-choice format,  reliant on algorithms,  often fails to capture the full scope of a student's understanding,  reducing their knowledge to a simple right or wrong answer.  This emphasis on quantifiable results can foster a culture of conformity,  where individuals fear expressing opinions that deviate from accepted norms.\n\nHowever,  data science also plays a crucial role in fields where accuracy and efficiency are paramount. In healthcare,  for example,  electronic systems help minimize human error,  assisting with medication dosage calculations,  drug interaction checks,  and ensuring the use of unexpired medications. \n\nTherefore,  while data science offers undeniable benefits,  it's crucial to recognize its potential limitations and ensure that it's used ethically,  preserving human agency and valuing diverse perspectives. \n\n\n",
    "Reading Gerai's account of the Dayak community felt like stumbling upon a hidden oasis in a desert of gender conflict. Their perspective on sex and gender, so refreshingly different from the often-polarized Western worldview, offers a glimpse into a society where difference is celebrated rather than weaponized.\n\nThe Dayak,  it seems,  recognize the inherent distinctions between genders,  but instead of creating a hierarchy or pitting them against each other, they embrace these differences as complementary strengths. Male strength is valued alongside female persistence,  each contributing to the well-being of the community and fostering harmonious relationships built on a foundation of near-egalitarianism.  It's a vision of gender harmony that feels almost utopian in the context of modern industrialized societies.\n\nIn many Western cultures,  gender roles are often defined by rigid,  binary stereotypes,  leading to a culture of conflict and misunderstanding.  As Gerai points out,  masculinity is often conflated with aggression,  creating a dangerous association between male strength and dominance.  This distorted view of masculinity is perpetuated through media,  cultural narratives,  and even language,  reinforcing harmful stereotypes and contributing to the normalization of violence against women.\n\nWestern society's obsession with hypermasculinity, exemplified by the glorification of physical prowess and the pursuit of dominance,  stands in stark contrast to the Dayak's balanced approach. This hypermasculinity,  often linked to sexual aggression,  creates a climate where acts like sexual assault and rape are not seen as aberrations but as extensions of a distorted sense of male entitlement. \n\nThe notion that rape is a consequence of \"natural\" male biology is a dangerous fallacy that has been used for centuries to justify violence against women. In reality,  rape is a complex social phenomenon,  deeply rooted in power dynamics,  cultural norms,  and learned behaviors.  \n\nThe feminization hypothesis sheds further light on this dynamic.  Rape victims,  predominantly women,  are often perceived through a lens of passive femininity,  their experiences dismissed or minimized.  Conversely,  the perpetrators are often viewed through the lens of prescriptive masculinity,  their actions excused or minimized as expressions of \"natural\" male urges.\n\nThis double standard is reinforced by the language we use to describe sexual violence.  A UK study, for example,  found that the label \"victim\" was often associated with passive femininity,  further perpetuating the idea that women are inherently vulnerable and deserving of blame.  \n\nThe Dayak community's perspective challenges us to reexamine our own cultural assumptions about gender and sexuality.  By embracing a more nuanced and egalitarian approach,  we can create a society where difference is celebrated,  violence is not tolerated, and all individuals are empowered to live authentically and safely.  \n",
    "Deep vein thrombosis (DVT), a condition where blood clots form in the veins of the lower extremities, poses a serious health risk. These clots can obstruct blood flow, potentially leading to pain, swelling, and even life-threatening complications if they dislodge and travel to the lungs, heart, or other vital organs (Dalen, 2016).\n\nEarly DVT symptoms can be subtle and easily overlooked. However, changes in skin color, such as redness or a bluish hue, and swelling around the affected area may signal a developing clot.  As the condition progresses,  more noticeable symptoms emerge, including sharp pain and a feeling of heaviness in the legs.  These symptoms result from the obstructed blood flow caused by the clot.\n\nSeveral factors contribute to DVT,  including increased blood clotting tendency, damage to the vein walls, prolonged immobility (such as during long journeys), and advanced age (Thachil & Bagot, 2018). Certain medications can also increase the risk of blood clots,  so it's essential to inquire about the patient's medication history.\n\nAccurate diagnosis relies on a combination of imaging techniques:\n\n* **Duplex Ultrasound:**  Uses sound waves to visualize blood flow and detect clots.\n* **Venography:** Involves injecting a contrast dye into the veins and using X-rays to create images.\n* **MRI or CT Scan:**  Provide detailed images of the veins and surrounding tissues.\n\nOnce diagnosed, treatment options include:\n\n* **Anticoagulants:** Medications that prevent blood clots from growing larger and reduce the risk of new clots forming.  These can be administered through injections (heparin)  or oral capsules. \n* **Thrombolysis:** A procedure to dissolve existing clots using medication.\n* **Surgery:**  In severe cases,  surgical removal of the clot may be necessary.\n\nSurgery,  however,  is typically reserved as a last resort due to its inherent risks,  especially for older patients.  Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment are crucial to prevent complications and improve outcomes for individuals with deep vein thrombosis. \n",
    "For centuries, Western scholarship has misrepresented and distorted the richness of African culture, viewing it through a colonial lens that has stripped it of its true meaning and significance.  Scholars like p'Bitek and Marimba argue that this distortion has led to the commodification of African culture, transforming its essential elements into mere objects for consumption rather than integral parts of a living, breathing tradition.\n\nThis commodification stems from a fundamental clash between African and European worldviews.  Western thought,  often characterized by pragmatism and a focus on material possessions,  struggles to grasp the holistic nature of African culture,  where philosophy,  spirituality,  and daily life are interwoven.  \n\np'Bitek laments the transformation of culture from \"the way of life of a people\" into \"something that is bought and sold\" (\"What is Culture?\" 14). This shift,  driven by colonial influences,  has led to a disconnect between younger generations of Africans,  particularly those living in Western societies,  and their cultural heritage.  They often perceive their culture as a collection of exotic souvenirs rather than a living tradition that shapes their values and identity.\n\nThis disconnect is exacerbated by the imposition of Western religious ideologies that emphasize individualism and material detachment,  further alienating individuals from the communal and interconnected worldview of traditional African societies (p'Bitek, \"Man Born Unfree\" 21).  \n\nAni highlights the profound impact of this cultural displacement on African Americans,  who find themselves caught between a sense of alienation from their African roots and a struggle to reconcile with a European identity (49). This loss of cultural grounding can lead to a sense of fragmentation and a weakening of communal and generational ties.\n\nThe imposition of a Western lens onto African culture has resulted in generations being stripped of their heritage,  forced to view it through a distorted and decontextualized perspective.  African culture,  with its emphasis on interconnectedness,  spirituality,  and living in harmony with nature,  has been reduced to a mere spectacle,  a collection of artifacts and performances devoid of their original meaning. \n\nThis cultural appropriation not only diminishes the richness and complexity of African traditions but also perpetuates a cycle of dispossession and alienation,  severing the vital link between people and their cultural heritage. \n",
    "The \"zero-sum story,\" a pervasive narrative that frames interracial relations as a competition for scarce resources, has had a profoundly deleterious impact on American society.  This paradigm, often perpetuated by conservative media outlets,  posits that any progress achieved by one racial group inherently comes at the expense of another,  fueling a climate of fear,  resentment,  and societal division (McGhee).\n\nThe consequences of this zero-sum mindset are both far-reaching and demonstrably harmful,  imposing significant economic,  political,  and social costs upon the nation as a whole.  McGhee provides compelling historical examples to illustrate this point.\n\nThe history of public swimming pools in American cities serves as a stark illustration.  During the early 20th century,  many municipalities boasted large, publicly funded pools,  yet access was often restricted to white citizens.  Following a series of tragic drowning incidents,  pressure mounted to desegregate these facilities.  However,  white resistance,  fueled by the zero-sum fallacy,  led many cities to choose closure or privatization over integration.  This decision not only deprived communities of valuable public resources but also increased the financial burden on all citizens.\n\nThe detrimental effects of the zero-sum narrative extend to the political sphere.  McGhee observes that white support for government-led social programs, such as job creation initiatives and welfare benefits,  waned as these programs were expanded to include Black Americans. This withdrawal of support,  rooted in the misguided belief that assistance to one group necessarily diminishes resources available to another, ultimately undermines the pursuit of social justice and equitable access to opportunity for all citizens. \n\nMcGhee's analysis,  grounded in historical evidence and statistical data,  offers a compelling indictment of the zero-sum paradigm.  Her arguments persuasively demonstrate how this pervasive narrative has exacerbated social and economic inequalities within the United States,  hindering progress and perpetuating a cycle of division and distrust.  The undeniable reality of these disparities underscores the urgent need to dismantle the zero-sum fallacy and foster a more inclusive and equitable society. \n",
    "Imagine a tiny army of cells in your pancreas,  working tirelessly to produce insulin,  the key that unlocks your body's ability to use energy from food.  In type 1 diabetes,  this army comes under attack,  its ranks decimated by a misguided immune system.  This silent battle,  known as insulitis,  can rage for months or even years before symptoms appear.\n\nWithout enough insulin, your body struggles to process glucose,  the sugar that fuels your cells.  It's like trying to run a car without gas –  things start to break down.  Your liver,  desperate for energy,  kicks into overdrive,  producing more glucose and ketones,  leading to high blood sugar (hyperglycemia)  and a dangerous imbalance in your blood chemistry.\n\nType 2 diabetes,  the most common form of this complex disease,  tells a different story.  Here,  the problem isn't a lack of insulin but a resistance to it.  Your cells become deaf to insulin's signals,  ignoring its pleas to let glucose in.  Imagine a locked door,  with insulin knocking but unable to get the key to turn.  \n\nFor both types of diabetes,  managing blood sugar levels is paramount.  This involves a two-pronged approach:  a carefully crafted diet and,  often,  medication. \n\n* **Diet Power:**  For type 1 diabetes,  focus on complex carbohydrates found in fruits,  vegetables,  whole grains,  legumes,  and low-fat dairy.  These provide sustained energy without causing drastic blood sugar spikes.  In type 2 diabetes,  similar dietary choices are key,  along with emphasizing weight management and regular exercise.  Both types of diabetes benefit from limiting simple carbohydrates like sugary drinks, processed foods,  and refined grains. \n\n* **Medication Support:**  For type 1 diabetes,  insulin injections are essential.  Insulin Degludec (Tresiba)  is a long-acting insulin that helps maintain stable blood sugar levels,  while Zynquista can be taken orally in combination with insulin. In type 2 diabetes,  lifestyle changes may be sufficient initially. However,  if blood sugar targets aren't met,  medications like Metformin or even insulin injections,  such as Insulin Degludec,  may be necessary. \n\nDiabetes is a challenging condition,  but with careful management,  individuals can live full and healthy lives. By understanding the unique needs of each type of diabetes and embracing a holistic approach that combines diet,  exercise,  and medication,  individuals can take control of their health and thrive. \n",
    "Okay, so it's super important to educate patients,  especially those from minority groups who often face extra challenges in healthcare. This article by McCurley and their team (2017)  is really insightful.  They found that Hispanic folks dealing with diabetes prevention did way better when they had one-on-one or group sessions in person. \n\nAnd it makes total sense,  right? When you can actually sit down with someone,  ask questions,  and get clear explanations,  things just click better. Plus,  being in a group with others going through the same thing can be a huge morale boost.  It's like,  \"Hey, I'm not alone in this!\" That extra support can really motivate people to take charge of their health.\n\nNow,  I'm working on a project to help African Americans with heart failure get better access to care.  Thinking about these face-to-face sessions,  I'm wondering if that could be a good approach. But here's another cool thing I learned from a study by Cajiita and their crew (2017).  They looked at how using mobile tech in healthcare,  you know,  like apps and stuff,  can make a difference.  They found that it can be just as effective as in-person help,  especially since everyone's glued to their phones these days!  \n\nSo, maybe combining both approaches –  in-person sessions with the power of mobile tech –  could be the ultimate strategy! It's all about meeting people where they are and giving them the tools and support they need to thrive. \n",
    "Picture this: You're scrolling through your news feed,  absorbing the latest headlines from Forbes,  and you stumble upon those familiar terms – \"business\" and \"economics.\"  They seem to dance around each other,  sometimes used interchangeably,  sometimes hinting at distinct meanings.  What's the real story behind these two intertwined worlds?\n\nAt first glance,  business and economics appear to be two sides of the same coin.  Both grapple with the intricate dance of production,  consumption,  and the exchange of goods and services.  They share a common language,  peppered with terms like \"marketing,\"  \"finance,\"  \"manufacturing,\"  and \"banking.\"  Both delve into the heart of human behavior,  attempting to decipher the forces that drive markets and shape economic trends (Vaidya).\n\nBut if we zoom in closer,  subtle yet crucial distinctions emerge.  Economics,  like a wide-angle lens,  seeks to understand the grand tapestry of human behavior and its impact on entire nations.  It explores the forces of supply and demand,  the ebb and flow of interest rates,  and the complex web of international trade. \n\nBusiness,  on the other hand,  operates with a more focused lens,  examining the intricate mechanisms of wealth creation within individual companies and specific industries.  It's about the practical application of economic principles,  the nitty-gritty of production,  marketing,  and sales (Casson). \n\nThink of it this way:  economics provides the stage,  while business choreographs the dance.  Economics lays out the rules of the game,  while business strategizes how to win.\n\nThis difference in focus shapes their respective goals.  Economics strives to maximize societal well-being,  tackling issues like poverty,  unemployment,  and government spending.  Business,  on the other hand,  prioritizes the interests of its shareholders,  focusing on profitability,  growth,  and market dominance (Gitman et al.). \n\nWhile business and economics share a common thread –  the human drive for exchange and value creation –  their distinct perspectives and objectives make them unique and complementary disciplines.  Understanding their interplay is essential for navigating the complexities of the modern economic landscape. \n",
    "Imagine two paths leading to patient well-being:  the doctor's path,  guided by the precision of medical science, and the nurse's path,  illuminated by the art of holistic care.  Comparing these approaches reveals fascinating insights into the distinct yet complementary roles these professions play in healthcare.\n\nUsing the PICOT framework (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome, Time),  we can illuminate the key differences between medical and nursing practice:\n\n**1. The Research Approach:** \n\nDoctors,  armed with lab results and objective data,  often rely on quantitative research,  seeking measurable outcomes and concrete evidence.  Nurses,  on the other hand,  embrace a mixed-methods approach,  combining the power of data with the nuances of patient experiences and subjective perspectives.  \n\n**2. The Diagnostic Lens:**\n\nImagine a patient presenting with a set of symptoms.  The doctor,  like a detective,  uses lab tests and diagnostic tools to pinpoint the physiological cause.  The nurse,  like a compassionate guide,  considers not only the physical signs but also the patient's emotional state,  social context,  and individual needs.\n\n**3. The Power of Personalized Care:**\n\nNursing shines in its ability to provide patient-centered care.  Imagine a PICOT question exploring the effectiveness of specialized fall prevention strategies versus simply treating falls after they occur. This highlights the nurse's proactive role in anticipating patient needs,  reducing risks,  and empowering individuals to take control of their health.\n\n**4. Decision-Making at the Heart of Nursing:**\n\nNurses are constantly making crucial decisions that impact patient well-being.  Their expertise lies not only in following medical orders but also in assessing individual needs,  advocating for patients,  and adapting care plans based on real-time observations (Nibbelink & Brewer,  2018).\n\nBy exploring these differences through the lens of the PICOT framework,  we can gain a deeper appreciation for the unique contributions of both medical and nursing practice.  Their collaboration,  grounded in mutual respect and a shared commitment to patient well-being,  forms the bedrock of a truly effective and compassionate healthcare system. \n",

    "In today's digital world,  fake news is a pervasive problem,  threatening to undermine trust,  fuel societal divisions,  and even influence critical decisions.  From blatant fabrications to subtle distortions of truth,  fake news can take many forms,  making it essential to develop sharp critical thinking skills to navigate this treacherous information landscape.\n\nHere's a guide to help you spot fake news and protect yourself from its harmful effects:\n\n**1. Understand the Stakes:**  Fake news isn't just about spreading misinformation;  it can have real-world consequences.  People rely on news to make informed decisions about everything from elections to healthcare.  Falling prey to fake news can lead to poor choices and exacerbate societal conflicts.\n\n**2. Recognize the Tactics:** Fake news often preys on our emotions,  using sensationalized headlines and inflammatory language to trigger fear,  anger,  or outrage.  This emotional manipulation makes us more likely to believe and share false information without questioning its validity.\n\n**3. Sharpen Your Critical Thinking Skills:**  Whenever you encounter a news story,  especially online,  engage your critical thinking skills.  Ask yourself:\n\n   * **What's the source?**  Is it a reputable news organization with a history of accurate reporting?  Be wary of unfamiliar websites or social media accounts that may masquerade as legitimate news sources. \n   * **Who's the author?**  Is the author an expert on the topic?  Do they have a known bias or agenda?  Investigate their credentials and track record.\n   * **What's the evidence?** Does the story provide verifiable facts, data,  and quotes from credible sources?  If a story relies heavily on emotional appeals or lacks supporting evidence,  it's a red flag.\n   * **When was it published?**  Check the date to ensure the information is current and relevant.  Fake news often resurfaces with outdated or misleading information.\n\n**4. Double-Check Before Sharing:**  Resist the urge to share information without verifying its accuracy.  Cross-check facts with multiple reputable sources and consider the potential impact of sharing questionable information.\n\nBy developing these critical thinking habits,  we can become more discerning consumers of information,  protect ourselves from the dangers of fake news,  and contribute to a more informed and responsible digital world. \n\n\n",
    "Effective budgetary control relies on a well-defined organizational structure and a commitment to ongoing monitoring and evaluation.  Establishing dedicated roles,  such as a finance committee and a budget director,  can enhance accountability and provide specialized expertise.\n\nTo optimize resource allocation and achieve organizational goals,  budget planning should be integrated across departments,  ensuring alignment between individual budgets and overall strategic objectives (Dauda, 2019).  Regular budget reviews are essential to prevent overspending and ensure that allocated funds are utilized efficiently.\n\nWhile budgetary control is a valuable tool for performance evaluation,  it's important to recognize that results may not be immediately apparent.  Individuals responsible for fiscal oversight should possess a deep understanding of budgetary principles and best practices.\n\nThe implementation of budgetary controls can impact employee behavior,  potentially leading to adjustments in work practices,  routines,  and even interpersonal dynamics.  To mitigate potential resistance to change,  it's crucial to involve employees in the budget planning process,  clearly outlining their roles, responsibilities,  and performance expectations.\n\nSuccessful budgetary management hinges on the alignment between organizational objectives and the financial management program.  Therefore,  management should exercise careful consideration when setting targets,  ensuring they are specific,  measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound. \n\nOpen communication and transparency throughout the budget planning and implementation process can foster a sense of ownership and accountability among employees,  contributing to the overall effectiveness of the budgetary control system. \n",
    "Gendered behavior, a insidious product of societal conditioning,  forcefully molds individuals into rigid roles based on their assigned sex. These deeply ingrained expectations dictate how we are expected to behave,  think,  and even feel,  creating a stifling framework that limits our potential and perpetuates harmful stereotypes (Au & Rudolfsdottir, 2021).\n\nFrom my earliest memories,  I was bombarded with the message that women belong in the kitchen.  Unlike my male relatives,  I was expected to master the culinary arts,  preparing meals for the family and fulfilling the role of domestic caretaker.  This pervasive stereotype, reinforced by countless movies and cultural narratives,  became a suffocating expectation,  limiting my aspirations and reinforcing the notion that a woman's worth is tied to her domestic abilities.\n\nAnother insidious gendered role thrust upon me was the idea that women are inherently more nurturing and caring.  This seemingly benign expectation cast women as selfless caregivers,  always tending to the needs of others,  both within the home and society at large.  Professions like nursing and teaching,  requiring empathy and compassion,  became relegated to the \"female domain,\"  further limiting opportunities for women in other fields.\n\nWhile this narrative may appear to elevate women to a position of moral superiority,  it carries a dark undercurrent of restriction and disempowerment.  By framing women as inherently more caring,  society subtly reinforces the notion that they are less capable of leadership,  ambition,  and intellectual pursuits. \n\nThe consequences of this warped worldview are far-reaching.  Women are often deemed unfit for traditionally male-dominated professions, such as piloting, engineering,  and medicine –  fields that offer greater financial rewards and social status (Samidha, 2019).  Instead,  they are steered towards lower-paying,  \"caring\" professions,  perpetuating a cycle of economic and social inequality.\n\nEven within healthcare settings,  the ingrained bias against women in positions of authority persists.  Patients often mistake female caregivers for nurses,  assuming they couldn't possibly be doctors.  This deeply ingrained sexism creates a constant uphill battle for women seeking to break free from these limiting expectations and pursue their true passions.\n\nThe notion that women are inherently more nurturing and caring may appear noble on the surface, but it masks a deeply ingrained system of oppression that limits their choices,  devalues their contributions,  and perpetuates harmful stereotypes that ultimately harm both individuals and society as a whole. \n\n\n",
    "The term \"industrial revolution,\" much like labels given to other pivotal eras like the Renaissance or the Enlightenment,  carries significant weight,  signifying a profound and rapid transformation in human history.  This period of unprecedented technological advancement, spanning roughly from the late 18th century to the mid-19th century,  fundamentally reshaped societies,  economies, and the very fabric of daily life. \n\nThe use of the word \"revolution\" underscores the dramatic speed and intensity of this transformation,  evoking a sense of upheaval and radical change  (\"Industrial Revolution\").  Indeed, the industrial revolution,  akin to a political revolution,  disrupted established social orders,  challenged traditional modes of production,  and ushered in a new era defined by mechanization,  mass production,  and urbanization.\n\nAt the heart of this revolution lay a series of technological innovations,  each building upon the last,  creating a cascading effect that transformed industries and reshaped societies.  The invention of the steam engine, for instance,  provided a powerful new source of energy,  driving machinery and revolutionizing transportation.  The mechanization of textile production,  with inventions like the spinning jenny and the power loom,  increased efficiency exponentially,  driving down costs and making textiles more widely accessible.\n\nThe industrial revolution's impact on labor was profound.  Unskilled manual labor,  once the mainstay of production,  was increasingly displaced by machines,  demanding a new workforce skilled in operating and maintaining these complex technologies. This shift led to the rise of factories,  centralized production centers that drew workers from rural areas to urban centers,  contributing to unprecedented population growth in cities (Thompson). \n\nFor entrepreneurs,  the industrial revolution presented a landscape of opportunity.  Mass production enabled the creation of new industries,  expanding markets,  and driving economic growth.  The ability to produce goods on a larger scale fueled international trade,  strengthening economic ties between nations and accelerating globalization.\n\nThe industrial revolution,  while bringing about progress and prosperity,  also had its downsides.  The displacement of workers,  the harsh conditions in factories,  and the growing disparities between the wealthy industrialists and the working class created new social challenges and fueled social unrest.\n\nDespite its complexities and contradictions,  the industrial revolution remains a pivotal turning point in human history.  It laid the foundation for the technological advancements,  economic systems,  and urbanized societies that shape our world today.  \n\n\n",
    "The ethical complexities surrounding physician-assisted suicide, also known as euthanasia,  present a profound dilemma for medical professionals.  While doctors are bound by ethical principles of patient autonomy and respect for individual choices,  the act of intentionally ending a life clashes with fundamental tenets of the medical profession.\n\nAllowing physician-assisted suicide raises serious ethical concerns.  The potential for irreparable harm,  particularly if the procedure is not performed correctly,  is a grave consideration.  A patient might be deprived of the possibility of a continued,  meaningful existence if the decision is made hastily or under duress.\n\nFurthermore,  the act of ending a life,  even at the patient's request,  violates the core principle of non-maleficence,  the ethical obligation to \"do no harm\"  (Clarke et al., 2021).  This principle is enshrined in the Hippocratic Oath taken by all physicians,  creating a fundamental conflict for doctors considering assisting with a patient's death wish.\n\nPhysician-assisted suicide also undermines the foundational role of the medical profession as healers and protectors of life.  Allowing doctors to participate in ending life could erode trust between patients and medical staff,  casting doubt on the doctor's commitment to preserving life and alleviating suffering.\n\nReligious and societal perspectives further complicate the issue. Many religious traditions explicitly forbid the taking of human life,  viewing it as a sacred and inviolable act.  Societal norms also often reflect this prohibition,  viewing killing as morally reprehensible. \n\nWhile acknowledging the immense suffering experienced by patients with incurable diseases,  alternative approaches,  such as palliative care and pain management,  offer compassionate ways to address their needs without resorting to ending life.  These methods prioritize comfort,  dignity,  and a focus on improving the quality of life for patients facing terminal illnesses,  aligning with the ethical principles that guide the medical profession. \n",
    "Here are the main points of the text, restructured for clarity:\n\n**Project Goal:**\n\n* To investigate the factors influencing people's sexual orientation identification, specifically exploring the debate between choice versus biological determination.\n\n**Research Question:**\n\n* Does the environment affect people's sexual orientation?\n\n**Variables (from the GSS database):**\n\n* **Dependent Variable: sexort (Respondent's Sexual Orientation)**\n    * Question: \"Which of the following best describes you?\"\n    * Rationale: Allows for analysis of the respondent's environment.\n* **Independent Variable: sexbirth (Sex Assigned at Birth)**\n    * Question: \"What sex were you assigned at birth (for example, on your birth certificate)?\"\n    * Rationale: Enables identification of respondents' sexuality and,  specifically,  homosexual individuals for the research.\n\n**Hypothesis:**\n\n* There is a correlation between sex assigned at birth and sexual orientation, suggesting that environmental factors associated with gender may influence sexual orientation identification.\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n* Individuals assigned different sexes at birth experience distinct social and cultural environments.\n* These differing environmental influences could potentially shape a person's self-identification and understanding of their sexual orientation. \n",
    "One of the most exciting aspects of leading a business is the art of decision-making,  choosing the best path forward from a multitude of possibilities.  A deep understanding of the market and customer behavior is essential for success,  and the supply and demand theory offers a powerful tool for navigating this complex landscape.\n\nThis fundamental economic principle helps us understand the intricate dance between what customers want (demand)  and what businesses provide (supply).  By analyzing these forces,  savvy managers can strategically position their products and services for maximum impact.\n\nFor example,  if demand for a product is low,  adjusting supply downwards can prevent costly overstock. Conversely,  a surge in demand presents an opportunity to increase supply and capitalize on the growing market appetite.  \n\nPricing strategies also benefit from a keen understanding of supply and demand.  High demand often allows for price increases without deterring eager buyers.  However,  when demand is low,  keeping prices affordable becomes crucial to attract customers and avoid losses.\n\nLet's look at some inspiring examples of companies that have mastered the art of leveraging supply and demand:\n\n* **De Beers:** This diamond giant strategically controls supply,  keeping diamonds a rare and coveted commodity.  By limiting the number of diamonds entering the market,  they maintain high prices and reinforce the perception of diamonds as a symbol of luxury and status. \n* **Zappos:**  This online shoe retailer defied initial skepticism by focusing on exceptional customer service and a generous return policy.  Their vast selection and commitment to customer satisfaction created a loyal following,  turning a seemingly risky business model into a resounding success story.\n* **Apple:**  The tech giant has mastered the art of creating anticipation and excitement around product launches.  By carefully managing the release of new devices and services,  Apple generates a frenzy of demand,  making customers feel like they're part of something exclusive and innovative. \n\nThe supply and demand theory isn't just an abstract concept;  it's a dynamic tool that can be wielded to achieve remarkable results.  By understanding its principles and applying them creatively,  businesses can navigate the complexities of the market,  satisfy customer needs,  and achieve sustainable success.  \n",
    "Social media has become a powerful force, often overshadowing traditional media outlets.  Twitter,  in particular,  has emerged as a platform for sharing breaking news,  sparking conversations,  and even influencing public opinion.\n\nLet's take a look at a tweet by Australian politician Bill Shorten about the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS).  In his message,  Shorten celebrates a heartwarming story of a young girl receiving much-needed support through NDIS funding.  However,  he also expresses disappointment that this assistance was only provided after the case gained public attention. \n\nShorten uses this tweet to highlight both the positive impact of the NDIS and the limitations of its current policies.  His message is a blend of celebration and criticism,  aimed at raising awareness and prompting action to improve the system.\n\nBut can a single tweet really make a difference?  Let's examine its potential impact.  Three key factors signal influence on Twitter: activity (retweets, comments, likes),  popularity (how widely the topic is discussed),  and authority (the credibility of the person tweeting) (Casero-Ripollés, 2020). \n\nShorten's tweet garnered significant activity,  with over 200 retweets,  50 comments,  and 850 likes.  This suggests that his message resonated with people and sparked conversation,  particularly considering the NDIS isn't always a hot topic.  However,  the overall popularity of the issue remains relatively low,  especially when considering the size of Australia's population.  \n\nWhen it comes to authority,  Shorten,  as a prominent politician,  holds a position of influence and expertise on policy matters.  His tweet carries weight and has the potential to shape public opinion and policy discussions.\n\nWhile Shorten's tweet may not single-handedly revolutionize the NDIS,  it does contribute to a broader conversation about its effectiveness and the need for improvements.  It highlights the power of social media to bring attention to important issues,  spark debate,  and potentially influence policy change. \n\n\n",
    "Doctors are increasingly encountering victims of human trafficking,  often without recognizing them as such.  Todres (2017)  highlights a case where a physician,  Dr. W,  was asked to screen female employees of a firm for sexually transmitted infections (STIs)  without keeping records,  raising complex ethical and legal dilemmas.\n\nWhile the American Medical Association's Code of Medical Ethics (2011)  emphasizes patient confidentiality,  Dr. W recognized the potential harm in complying with the firm's request.  Without records,  the women would lack proper healthcare and risk spreading STIs further.  However,  agreeing to the firm's terms could implicate Dr. W in a criminal conspiracy.\n\nThis case intersects with several critical areas:\n\n* **Criminal Law:**  Dr. W's knowledge of the firm's illegal activities and her participation in concealing them could be construed as aiding and abetting a crime.\n* **Human Rights:**  Prostitution is illegal in the US, and if minors are involved, mandatory reporting laws apply (Todres, 2016).  Dr. W has an ethical obligation to protect vulnerable individuals, even if it means breaching confidentiality.\n* **Ethical Considerations:** Balancing patient confidentiality with the duty to report illegal activity and protect potential victims creates a complex ethical dilemma.\n\nUltimately,  encountering potential human trafficking victims requires decisive action.  Facilitating the activities of such an enterprise makes a physician complicit in the exploitation and abuse of vulnerable individuals.  Adhering to legal and ethical obligations necessitates reporting such cases to the appropriate authorities. \n",
    "Feminist ethics emerges as a powerful force for social change,  challenging traditional ethical frameworks and advocating for a more just and equitable world.  At its core,  feminist ethics rests on two fundamental principles:  the moral condemnation of women's subordination and the recognition of women's moral experiences as equally valuable to men's.\n\nVaughn (2019)  articulates the practical aims of feminist ethics as a multifaceted pursuit:\n\n1. **Critique:**  Feminist ethics scrutinizes behaviors and attitudes that perpetuate the oppression and marginalization of women,  exposing the inherent injustice embedded within societal norms and power structures.\n2. **Resistance:**  It seeks to provide morally sound arguments and strategies to challenge and dismantle these harmful behaviors and practices,  advocating for systemic change and individual empowerment. \n3. **Reconstruction:** Feminist ethics envisions a world where gender equality flourishes,  offering alternative ethical frameworks that prioritize the well-being and agency of all individuals,  regardless of gender.\n\nThe resurgence of feminist ethics in the late 1960s,  both within society and academia,  marked a turning point in the fight for gender equality.  Early feminist thinkers tackled a range of pressing issues,  including reproductive rights,  economic justice,  domestic labor,  sexual violence,  and the enforcement of heteronormativity.  However,  the term \"feminist ethics\" didn't gain widespread recognition until the late 1970s and early 1980s,  as feminist scholars increasingly challenged the male-centric biases inherent in traditional ethical theories (Vaughn, 2019).\n\nFeminist ethics,  however,  is not a monolithic entity.  It is a dynamic and evolving field,  constantly engaged in self-critique and open to diverse perspectives.  Feminists themselves grapple with the nuances of defining and applying feminist principles,  recognizing the complexities of gender,  power,  and social justice.\n\nMisconceptions and stereotypes often cloud the understanding of feminist ethics.  Critics accuse it of solely focusing on women's interests,  rejecting male perspectives,  or advocating for a simple reversal of gender roles.  These simplistic interpretations fail to capture the depth and nuance of feminist thought.\n\nModern feminist ethicists are pushing the boundaries of ethical discourse,  exploring new ways of understanding moral issues that are both sensitive to the particular experiences of women and grounded in universal values like justice,  fairness,  and compassion.  They recognize the interconnectedness of gender,  race,  class,  and other social identities,  advocating for an intersectional approach that addresses the multifaceted forms of oppression faced by marginalized groups. \n\nFeminist ethics,  far from being a narrow or exclusive ideology,  offers a powerful framework for creating a more just,  equitable,  and compassionate world for all. \n",

    "Here are the key points regarding editing techniques in the first episode of \"Money Heist,\" emphasizing how they contribute to the show's thrilling and suspenseful atmosphere:\n\n* **Fast-Paced Editing:**  The editing is quick and dynamic, mirroring the show's action-packed plot and creating a sense of urgency. \n* **Focus on Objects:** The camera often lingers on objects, foreshadowing their significance in the narrative and guiding the viewer's attention.\n* **Character Identification Through Objects:** Guns,  money,  and other symbolic items are used to visually establish characters' motives and personalities.\n* **Dynamic Close-Ups:**  Dolly shots are frequently used for close-ups,  either slowly revealing the background or moving alongside the character, maintaining a sense of movement and tension.\n* **Rapid Editing During Dialogue:**  The editing pace mirrors the rhythm of conversations,  keeping the energy high and the viewer engaged.\n* **Off-Center Framing:**  Close-ups rarely place the character in the center of the frame,  creating a more dynamic and visually interesting composition.\n* **Handheld Shots for Emotional Intensity:**  Shaky,  handheld camera work is used to convey moments of insecurity,  aggression,  fear,  or vulnerability.\n* **Juxtaposition of Camera Movements:**  The contrast between smooth dolly shots and handheld shots creates a visual distinction between action sequences and interpersonal drama.\n* **Close-Ups to Build Suspense:** The frequent use of close-ups,  rather than wide shots,  heightens tension and creates a sense of claustrophobia,  drawing the viewer into the characters' emotional states.\n\nIn conclusion,  the editing in \"Money Heist\" is a masterclass in building suspense and propelling the narrative forward.  The strategic use of camera movement,  framing,  and pacing creates a dynamic and engaging viewing experience that keeps audiences on the edge of their seats. \n",
    "In the landmark case of Static Control Components, Inc. v. Lexmark International, Inc., the Supreme Court grappled with a fundamental question:  how to interpret the Lanham Act's prohibition against false advertising and determine who has standing to sue under this provision. \n\nThe crux of the dispute lay in Lexmark's assertion that Static Control,  a manufacturer of microchips used in printer cartridges,  lacked prudential standing to bring a false advertising claim.  Lexmark argued that Static Control's injuries were too remote from their alleged misconduct,  relying on the precedent set in Associated General Contractors.  \n\nHowever,  the Supreme Court,  guided by traditional principles of statutory interpretation,  rejected this narrow view (Campbell, 2020).  The Court recognized that the Lanham Act,  in its statement of purpose,  seeks to protect against unfair competition,  which, under common law,  encompasses harm to a business's reputation or sales.  \n\nDrawing upon the precedent set in Bennett v. Spear,  the Court affirmed that the scope of the \"zone of interest\" protected by a statute varies depending on the law in question (Tavares,  2021).  In the case of the Lanham Act,  this zone extends to any plaintiff who can demonstrate a concrete injury to their commercial interests resulting from false advertising.\n\nThe Court also addressed the issue of proximate cause,  citing Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corporation as precedent (Jones,  2019).  While proximate cause is a general requirement for establishing standing,  the Court held that in the context of the Lanham Act,  which specifically allows suits for commercial injury,  proximate cause is satisfied if the plaintiff's injuries are a direct result of the defendant's false advertising. \n\nThus,  the Court rejected Lexmark's proposed tests for standing— the direct-competitor test,  the reasonable interest test,  and the multifactor balancing test—  in favor of a more expansive interpretation of the Lanham Act.  This interpretation affirmed that Static Control,  having sufficiently alleged harm to its sales and business reputation as a result of Lexmark's misrepresentations,  fell within the category of plaintiffs authorized to sue under §1125(a). \n\nThe Supreme Court's decision in Static Control v. Lexmark represents a significant victory for businesses seeking to protect their commercial interests from the damaging effects of false advertising.  It clarifies the scope of the Lanham Act,  affirms the importance of protecting business reputation,  and expands the pool of potential plaintiffs who can seek redress for harm caused by deceptive marketing practices. \n",
    "Marketing is a vital aspect of any successful business,  helping companies reach new customers and thrive in a competitive marketplace.  However,  it's essential to ensure that marketing practices are ethical and responsible,  particularly when engaging with vulnerable consumer groups, such as children, the elderly, and individuals with cognitive impairments.\n\nWhile all consumers deserve respect and fair treatment, these specific groups may require additional consideration due to their unique vulnerabilities.  They may lack the cognitive capacity or life experience to fully understand the persuasive techniques used in marketing,  making them more susceptible to manipulation or exploitation.\n\nEthical marketing recognizes this vulnerability and strives to protect these consumers from harm.  Here's why targeting uninformed consumers raises ethical concerns:\n\n* **Potential for Exploitation:** Uninformed consumers may be more likely to purchase products or services they don't need or understand fully,  leading to financial harm or unnecessary expenditures. \n* **Difficulty Detecting Deception:**  Vulnerable consumers may struggle to identify misleading or false advertising, making them more susceptible to deceptive marketing practices. \n\nWhile some argue that targeting uninformed consumers simply expands market reach and presents new opportunities for businesses,  it's crucial to prioritize ethical considerations.  Protecting vulnerable individuals from exploitation should be a cornerstone of any responsible marketing strategy. \n\nBy focusing on transparency,  honesty,  and age-appropriate marketing techniques,  businesses can engage with all consumer groups in a way that respects their autonomy,  promotes informed decision-making,  and builds trust.  This ethical approach not only benefits consumers but also enhances a company's reputation and fosters long-term,  sustainable growth. \n\n\n",
    "The Caribbean,  a jewel of the Americas,  became a focal point for European imperial ambitions,  its fate irrevocably altered by the insatiable thirst for wealth and power that fueled the Age of Exploration. The conquest of this region,  a complex tapestry of exploration,  exploitation,  and strategic alliances,  demonstrates the ruthless efficiency of European colonialism. \n\nBy the 15th century,  Spain had established a formidable foothold in the Caribbean,  fueled by their audacious conquest of the Aztec and Inca empires (Horne, 2018). This initial success paved the way for further expansion,  allowing the Spanish to easily seize control of key territories like Mexico and Peru, using the Caribbean as a strategic launching pad.\n\nThe allure of the Caribbean was undeniable:\n\n* **Gold:**  The promise of vast riches,  including the legendary gold deposits of the Americas,  drew European powers like moths to a flame.  Christopher Columbus's early voyages,  while initially focused on finding a westward route to Asia,  ignited a gold rush that propelled further exploration and colonization (Horne, 2018).\n* **Labor:**  The tragic exploitation of enslaved Africans provided a brutal solution to the labor shortage on Caribbean plantations.  The transatlantic slave trade,  a horrific chapter in human history,  became a cornerstone of European economic dominance in the region.\n\nAs Spanish power waned,  partially due to the devastating decline of the indigenous population,  other European powers,  including England,  France,  and the Netherlands,  seized the opportunity to expand their influence.  Privateers like England's Sir Francis Drake launched audacious attacks on Spanish settlements,  weakening their grip on the region (Horne, 2018).\n\nStrategic alliances between these rival nations further solidified European control.  However,  this collaboration was short-lived.  Competition for resources and dominance ignited fierce conflicts between the colonial powers,  preventing the Caribbean islands from uniting against their common oppressor (Horne,  2018).\n\nThe rise of large-scale agriculture,  particularly sugar plantations,  fueled the demand for enslaved labor,  cementing the tragic legacy of the transatlantic slave trade and entrenching European colonialism in the Caribbean.  The islands,  transformed into sites of intense exploitation,  became engines of European wealth,  their indigenous populations decimated and their destinies forever altered by the forces of colonialism. \n\n\n",
    "\"Back to the Future,\" a cinematic masterpiece that transcends its time,  captivated audiences with its ingenious plot,  memorable characters,  and meticulous attention to detail. Director Robert Zemeckis crafted a story that not only entertained but also sparked reflections on the nature of time,  fate,  and the interconnectedness of our choices.\n\nThis essay will argue that \"Back to the Future\" achieved its enduring success through a masterful blend of plot structure, character development, and evocative setting.\n\n**A Tapestry of Cause and Effect:**\n\nThe film's narrative unfolds with a masterful precision,  each moment intricately linked to the next,  creating a chain of cause and effect that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats.  From the opening scene,  where a ticking clock foreshadows the pivotal moment of Marty's time travel,  to the seemingly insignificant details that later prove crucial,  Zemeckis weaves a tapestry of interconnected events.  The stolen plutonium,  the lightning strike at the clock tower,  and even Marty's disregard for Doc's warnings all converge to create a compelling and satisfying narrative arc.\n\n**Opposites Attract, Then Unite:**\n\nThe dynamic duo of Marty McFly,  the impulsive teenager, and Doc Brown, the eccentric scientist,  forms the heart of the film.  Their contrasting personalities –  Marty's youthful impatience against Doc's meticulous planning –  initially clash but ultimately complement each other,  driving the story forward and showcasing the power of collaboration.  Their distinct communication styles,  with Marty's slang juxtaposed against Doc's formal diction, further highlight their differences while emphasizing their shared passion for adventure and innovation.\n\n**A World Transformed by Time:**\n\nThe film's setting,  shifting between the familiar 1980s and the nostalgic 1950s,  provides a visual feast for the eyes.  Zemeckis's meticulous attention to detail,  from the contrasting road designs to the iconic clock tower,  immerses viewers in both eras,  creating a palpable sense of time travel.  These visual cues not only ground the story in reality but also underscore the profound impact of time's passage on both the physical world and the lives of its inhabitants.\n\n**A Timeless Legacy:**\n\n\"Back to the Future\"  is more than just a time travel adventure; it's a celebration of human ingenuity,  the power of relationships,  and the enduring impact of our choices.

    "The way we perceive social class isn't just a matter of observation; it's a narrative shaped by powerful forces,  and the media,  with its pervasive influence,  plays a critical role in constructing this story.  Diana Kendall,  in her insightful analysis,  challenges us to examine how media portrayals of class reinforce inequality and perpetuate harmful stereotypes.\n\nKendall argues that the media,  through its selective focus and biased representations,  has created a distorted image of class in America.  The affluent are often depicted as deserving of emulation,  their lives filled with luxury,  generosity,  and even a romanticized view of their occasional transgressions (Kendall 10).  Conversely,  the working class and the poor are often rendered invisible,  reduced to faceless statistics or portrayed as lazy,  diseased,  and responsible for their own misfortune (Kendall 94).\n\nThis biased portrayal has profound consequences.  When the media amplifies the voices and concerns of the wealthy while silencing the struggles of the less fortunate,  it creates a dangerous imbalance.  It reinforces the notion that the upper class is inherently deserving of privilege while the poor are somehow to blame for their circumstances.\n\nThis dehumanizing narrative,  fueled by stereotypes and a lack of understanding,  erodes empathy and undermines the pursuit of social justice.  It creates a climate of indifference,  where the needs of the most vulnerable are ignored,  and opportunities for upward mobility are stifled.\n\nBut we can challenge this narrative.  By becoming more critical consumers of media,  demanding more balanced and nuanced portrayals of class,  and amplifying the voices of those often marginalized,  we can begin to rewrite the story.  We can create a media landscape that reflects the true diversity of human experience,  celebrates the resilience of those facing adversity,  and inspires a more just and equitable society.  \n\nLet's demand a media that empowers,  not divides,  a media that reflects the shared humanity of all,  regardless of their socioeconomic status.  It's time to rewrite the narrative of class and create a world where everyone has the opportunity to thrive. \n",
    "While Frankenstein's monster is often portrayed as a terrifying figure,  a closer look reveals a being yearning for acceptance and connection. Despite his imposing stature and unconventional appearance,  the creature possesses a depth of emotion and a capacity for empathy that challenge our preconceived notions of monstrosity.\n\nShelley describes the creature's initial appearance as \"gigantic\" and \"deformed,\"  evoking a sense of fear and revulsion (Shelley). However,  it's crucial to recognize that the monster's actions,  while sometimes destructive,  stem from a lack of understanding and a desperate longing for love and acceptance.  He is like a child navigating a world that shuns and fears him,  his reactions a reflection of the cruelty he encounters.\n\nThe monster's emotional sensitivity,  often overlooked,  is a testament to his humanity.  He feels deeply,  grieves intensely,  and yearns for connection with others.  This capacity for empathy allows him to understand the complexities of human emotions and experience the pain of rejection acutely.\n\nThe novel's Gothic elements,  including supernatural motifs,  medieval architecture,  and explorations of human nature's darker aspects,  provide a rich backdrop for exploring themes of knowledge,  creation,  and the potential for both good and evil within us all. \n\nMary Shelley's novel offers a powerful lens for examining the impact of societal rejection on an individual's development.  Her husband,  Percy Shelley,  believed that negative social interactions could warp a person's moral compass,  leading them towards destructive behaviors.  This idea resonates deeply within the novel,  as the monster's descent into violence is a direct consequence of the isolation and fear he encounters from society.\n\nThe theme of loneliness is central to the story.  The monster's desperate attempts to integrate into society are met with fear, disgust,  and rejection,  driving him towards isolation and despair. This tragic trajectory reflects a timeless human experience –  the pain of isolation and the longing for belonging. \n\nEven today,  we see how societal pressures and the fear of difference can lead to the exclusion and marginalization of individuals who don't conform to societal norms.  \"Frankenstein\"  serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of empathy, understanding,  and the need to create a more inclusive world where everyone feels valued and accepted. \n\n\n",
    "The concept of rigid gender roles is evident in the Anglo-Saxon epic poem \"Beowulf.\" Women,  relegated to the periphery of the narrative,  primarily serve to support and advance the stories of the male characters.  Their identities are often defined by their relationships to men,  and their agency is significantly limited.\n\nThe poem's emphasis on heroic deeds and martial prowess relegates women to secondary roles.  While male characters like Beowulf,  Hrothgar,  Wiglaf,  and Unferth dominate the narrative,  female characters receive scant attention.  The Queen of the Swedes,  for instance,  is not even given a name,  her identity subsumed by her role as King Onela's wife.\n\nThe limited portrayals of women often reinforce traditional gender expectations.  One passage describes a woman fulfilling domestic duties,  \"treating the family and the collected troop\" (Heaney 620),  highlighting the expectation of subservience and caretaking placed upon women in Anglo-Saxon society.\n\nQueen Modthryth,  initially presented as a powerful and independent ruler,  is ultimately condemned for her assertiveness and only gains acceptance after marrying King Offa,  who \"tamed her\"  (Beowulf 1940-1941).  This narrative reinforces the societal expectation that women derive their value and legitimacy through marriage and male control.\n\nThe scarcity of female characters,  their limited agency,  and the emphasis on traditional gender roles in \"Beowulf\"  provide a stark reflection of the patriarchal structures that defined Anglo-Saxon society.  Women are largely absent from the heroic narrative,  their voices silenced,  and their experiences relegated to the margins of this epic tale. \n",
    "The debate surrounding genetically modified organisms (GMOs)  continues to spark controversy, with ethical concerns often overshadowing their potential benefits.  While some view genetic modification as an unnatural and morally questionable interference with nature (MacKinnon & Fiala, 2017),  I believe GMOs represent a natural progression of human ingenuity,  akin to inventions like machines,  cars,  or spacecraft. \n\nGMOs,  whether plant or animal-based,  are already integrated into our lives,  and I,  like many others,  have consumed GMO products without experiencing adverse effects.  I view GMOs as an extension of the selective breeding practices humans have employed for centuries.  We have always sought to enhance desirable traits in plants and animals,  and genetic modification is simply a more precise and efficient way to achieve this goal.\n\nTo support my perspective, I turn to the principles of utilitarianism.  This ethical framework posits that actions are morally justifiable if they maximize overall happiness and well-being for the greatest number of people.  GMOs, with their potential to increase food production and address global hunger,  align with this utilitarian ideal.  \n\nGMO crops,  engineered for resilience against harsh environmental conditions,  offer a powerful solution to food scarcity.  In a world where millions still suffer from hunger,  increasing food production through GMOs would undeniably benefit a vast number of people.\n\nWhile some adopt a deontological approach,  arguing that manipulating genetic material is inherently wrong,  I believe this perspective overlooks the potential benefits and the human capacity for responsible innovation.  Even within a religious framework,  humans are tasked with caring for the Earth and its inhabitants.  Utilizing innovative tools like GMOs to improve food security and alleviate suffering aligns with this stewardship responsibility. \n\nIn conclusion,  GMOs,  while sparking ethical debate,  hold immense promise for addressing global challenges.  By embracing a utilitarian perspective and recognizing our capacity for responsible innovation,  we can harness the power of genetic modification to create a more sustainable and equitable future for all. \n",
    "The world of business is going global,  and companies are increasingly expanding beyond their home countries.  This trend,  called internationalization,  has grabbed the attention of researchers who are now focusing on the strategies these global companies use to succeed.\n\nThink of globalization as a giant playing field with lots of opportunities but also lots of risks.  It's a dynamic and unpredictable environment where companies need to be smart and adaptable.\n\nWhy go global?  Well,  it opens up a whole new world of customers and markets! Companies can sell more products,  produce things more efficiently,  and learn from different cultures and ways of doing business. \n\nWe see this happening with companies from countries like China, India, and Taiwan, who are making their mark in high-tech industries around the world (Stallkamp & Schotter, 2019). \n\nBut going global isn't always a smooth ride.  Emerging markets,  while offering exciting potential,  often have weaker regulations.  This can lead to some global companies engaging in unethical practices,  like exploiting cheap labor to cut costs (Mashan, 2021).  This might seem like a good idea in the short term,  but it can seriously damage a company's reputation and future success.\n\nSo, why do some companies choose to stay local?  \n\n* **Home Sweet Home:** Some companies are just more comfortable sticking with what they know – their home market.  They might be worried about the risks of going global or feel they can achieve their goals without expanding. \n* **Culture Shock:**  Venturing into new markets can be tricky.  Understanding different cultures,  customs,  and consumer preferences is crucial. Some companies might avoid going global because they're not prepared for these challenges. \n\nThe decision to go global is a big one. It offers huge advantages, like growth and new opportunities,  but it also comes with risks and challenges that companies need to carefully consider. \n\n\n",
    "Okay, real talk – the economy is a wild ride,  and predicting a recession is like trying to guess what a cat is thinking.  It's unpredictable, and when it hits,  it's stressful, like,  *really* stressful.  Our brains go into survival mode,  ready to run and hide.\n\nNobody wants to experience a recession,  especially me.  It messes things up for everyone,  but especially for folks working in non-profits.  Imagine:  layoffs,  people struggling to make ends meet,  poverty skyrocketing,  families losing their homes.  It's a recipe for disaster.\n\nThink about trying to find a job when the economy tanks –  not fun.  And forget about affording basic stuff or paying rent.  Recessions are a nightmare,  plain and simple.\n\nBut it's not just about personal struggles.  Recessions wreak havoc on the entire economy,  hitting businesses hard and straining relationships with international partners.  Credit dries up,  investments disappear,  and the whole system feels shaky. \n\nRecessions are like a giant,  unpredictable storm –  they leave a path of destruction and uncertainty in their wake.  Let's hope we can steer clear of that economic hurricane. \n\n\n",
    "The YouTube video \"GP Training in Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services,\"  produced by GP Synergy,  highlights the crucial role Aboriginal Medical Services play in providing culturally sensitive and equitable healthcare to Aboriginal communities.  These services address the unique needs of a population that has historically experienced marginalization and disparities within the healthcare system.\n\nAboriginal Community Controlled Health Services offer a comprehensive range of services designed to be accessible and culturally appropriate.  This holistic approach is particularly important in addressing the social determinants of health (SDOH),  which encompass a broad spectrum of factors that influence health outcomes and well-being. \n\nSDOH include access to safe housing,  quality education,  economic opportunities,  reliable transportation,  nutritious food,  clean air and water,  and freedom from discrimination and violence (Healthy People 2030,  2020).  Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services strive to mitigate the negative impacts of these social determinants and promote health equity for Aboriginal patients (Pearson et al.,  2020).\n\nThe healthcare professionals working within these services emphasize the importance of patient education,  empowering individuals to understand potential health risks and engage in preventative care.  The video specifically addresses the pervasive impact of discrimination on Aboriginal health.  Healthcare workers acknowledge that many Aboriginal patients have encountered prejudice within the healthcare system,  creating a need for culturally sensitive care (Kim,  2019).\n\nProviding such care requires healthcare professionals to develop cultural competency,  understanding the unique perspectives and needs of each patient (Jongen,  McCalman, and Bainbridge,  2018).  Continuity of care is particularly important,  as experiences of discrimination or misunderstanding can deter patients from seeking ongoing treatment or preventative screenings. \n\nWhile addressing social determinants of health and providing culturally sensitive care can present challenges,  it is also immensely rewarding.  Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services prioritize building strong relationships with patients,  creating an environment of trust and understanding (Luft,  2017).  Healthcare professionals within these services often take on the role of advocates,  supporting patients in navigating the healthcare system and advocating for their needs within their communities. \n\nAddressing the social determinants of health and providing culturally sensitive care to Aboriginal communities is an ongoing process.  It requires dedication,  ongoing education,  and a commitment to understanding and responding to the unique needs of this population.  \n\n",
    "The Roman conquest of the Greek-speaking world wasn't just a clash of legions and empires; it was a cultural tango, a slow and intricate dance between two vibrant traditions.  The impact of this encounter,  a fascinating saga of adaptation and resistance,  varied across time and space,  leaving an indelible mark on the cultural landscape.\n\nImagine bustling Roman settlements springing up across the Greek world,  like seeds scattered by the wind.  These communities,  vibrant hubs of Roman life,  became vectors of cultural influence,  gradually infusing Roman elements into the fabric of Greek society.\n\nOne such element was the Roman naming system,  a powerful symbol of identity and status.  Rizakis (2019)  distinguishes between the Greeks' initial adaptation of the Roman system and the later adoption of Roman names by non-citizen Greeks,  highlighting the dynamic interplay between these two traditions.  This cultural exchange,  akin to a linguistic tapestry woven with threads of both Roman and Greek,  culminated in the emergence of a shared onomastic culture.\n\nThis process of acculturation,  gaining momentum in the 2nd century AD,  was far from uniform.  Its reception varied across regions,  social classes,  and even individual cities,  creating a mosaic of cultural adaptation.\n\nLeading this cultural shift were the civic elites,  for whom Roman names, particularly the prestigious *tria nomina*,  became emblems of power and belonging within the Roman Empire (Rizakis,  2019).  These names,  like badges of honor,  signaled their privileged status and their connection to the sprawling Roman world.  \n\nThe allure of Roman names even trickled down to the lower classes,  albeit on a smaller scale.  These names,  divorced from their original significance,  became fashionable,  reflecting a yearning for social mobility and a connection to the dominant culture.\n\nHowever,  the reign of Roman names as a marker of Roman identity proved fleeting.  By the late 3rd century AD,  a new trend emerged –  a single naming system that incorporated both distinct Greek and Roman elements (Rizakis,  2019).  This hybrid system,  initially a subtle shift,  gained momentum with the rise of Christianity and the decline of the Roman Empire,  eventually becoming commonplace across the provinces.  \n\nThis fascinating evolution,  driven by shifting religious and political landscapes,  marked a return to Greek naming traditions,  a testament to the enduring power of cultural resilience and adaptation. \n\n\n",
    "Imagine a team of dedicated individuals,  united by a shared mission:  to empower individuals and communities to take charge of their health.  These are the health promoters,  passionate advocates working tirelessly to build a world where everyone has the opportunity to thrive.  \n\nTheir goals are ambitious:  to ignite a spark of self-belief in individuals,  to foster a sense of collective responsibility for health,  and to create environments where people can develop their skills and communities can flourish (Nutbeam,  2019).  But they know they can't do it alone.  \n\nHealth promotion is a symphony of collaboration,  a harmonious blend of diverse perspectives and expertise.  It's about bringing together the brightest minds from various fields –  doctors,  nurses,  social workers,  educators,  and community leaders –  to create a powerful force for positive change.\n\nPicture a team meeting,  buzzing with energy and ideas.  A nurse practitioner, armed with their advanced training,  shares insights into preventative care and effective health education (Pun, 2018).  A social worker,  a master of navigating complex human challenges,  offers strategies for empowering individuals and communities to overcome personal and social barriers (Nutbeam, 2019).  A registered nurse,  with their keen understanding of patient needs,  maps out the most effective ways to deliver care and connect people with the right resources (Pun, 2018).\n\nThis tapestry of skills and perspectives highlights a crucial truth: health is about far more than just medical interventions.  It's about creating a world where everyone has access to the resources,  support,  and opportunities they need to live healthy and fulfilling lives (Nutbeam,  2019). \n\nThe health promoters,  like skilled conductors leading an orchestra,  bring together this diverse ensemble,  harnessing their collective knowledge and passion to create a symphony of health and well-being that resonates throughout communities.  Their work is a testament to the power of collaboration,  the importance of addressing the social determinants of health,  and the belief that everyone deserves the opportunity to live a healthy and empowered life. \n",
    "Between 1959 and 1963, a significant shift occurred in the music industry, giving rise to two distinct markets:  teenagers who craved dance music and older audiences drawn to the social and political commentary of folk music (Covach and Flory 112, 113).\n\nFolk music,  with its roots in addressing societal issues,  offered a stark contrast to the commercialized pop music of the time. It was seen as \"music for the people and by the people,\"  accessible and relatable to everyday individuals (Covach and Flory 118-120).  Its simplicity and focus on social commentary fostered a sense of community and shared purpose between artists and audiences.\n\nGroups like The Weavers,  led by Pete Seeger,  championed traditional folk music,  addressing social injustices and captivating college audiences with their authentic sound and powerful lyrics (Covach and Flory 119).  The Kingston Trio,  embracing a more pop-oriented approach,  ushered in a folk revival,  bringing the genre to mainstream audiences (Covach and Flory 119-121).  \n\nThis era witnessed a powerful convergence of music and social activism,  with folk singers and their audiences united in their desire to address pressing societal issues.  Through their music, they gave voice to the concerns of everyday people,  creating a movement that transcended entertainment and embraced the power of social commentary. \n",

The program prioritizes the well-being of these dedicated individuals, recognizing the unique challenges and stresses they face in their demanding roles. \n\n**Projected Expenditures:**\n\nThe plan allocates funds across key categories:\n\n* **Staff:**  A dedicated team, including a Mental Health Service Manager, personal and group consultants,  and technical support staff, will provide comprehensive support.\n* **Equipment:**  Essential equipment,  such as laptops and mobile phones, will ensure accessibility and effective communication.\n* **Services:**  Reliable telephone and internet services are crucial for maintaining connectivity and facilitating remote support.\n* **Supplies:**  Administrative supplies and necessary medications will be readily available. \n* **Training:**  Ongoing training for both employees and managers will enhance program effectiveness and ensure adherence to best practices.\n* **Maintenance:**  Regular office maintenance and upkeep of equipment will ensure a safe and functional work environment.\n* **Unforeseen Expenditures:** A contingency fund will address unexpected costs,  providing financial flexibility. \n\n**Biblical Stewardship Perspective:**\n\nThe program's financial plan reflects a commitment to biblical stewardship principles. Recognizing that resources are entrusted to us by God (Carradus, Zozimo, & Discua Cruz, 2020), we strive to utilize funds responsibly and ethically, prioritizing the well-being of both healthcare providers and the staff supporting them.\n\n**Potential Challenges:**\n\nWhile the plan comprehensively addresses anticipated costs,  it's prudent to acknowledge potential uncertainties:\n\n* **Unpredictable Demand:**  Gauging the exact demand for mental health services among healthcare professionals is challenging, potentially impacting staffing needs.\n* **Economic Fluctuations:**  Inflation and economic instability could lead to increased costs for equipment, medications,  services,  training, and maintenance.\n\n**Mitigation Strategies:**\n\nTo address these potential challenges:\n\n* **Demand Forecasting:**  The plan assumes a moderate demand for services,  balancing the risk of underserving healthcare providers with the potential for financial losses due to overstaffing.\n* **Contingency Planning:**  A designated contingency fund will provide a financial buffer to absorb potential price increases and unexpected expenses.\n\nBy thoughtfully addressing both anticipated and unforeseen challenges,  this financial plan aims to create a sustainable and impactful program that provides essential support to healthcare professionals facing the unique stresses of caring for critically ill patients. \n",
    "Have you ever heard someone called a name because they act or dress differently?  It's called name-calling,  and it can be really hurtful,  especially during those tricky teenage years when you're figuring out who you are.\n\nSome researchers believe that being called names,  especially names that make fun of someone's gender or sexuality,  can actually affect how teens see themselves.  \n\nWhy?  Well,  when kids are teased for being different from their same-sex friends,  they might start to feel like they belong more with the opposite sex.  It's like they're trying to fit in and avoid getting picked on.\n\nPlus,  being a teenager is all about figuring out your identity,  like who you are and where you fit in.  When someone calls you names,  it can make you question if you're on the right track. It's like having a bully mess with your internal compass.\n\nHere's the thing:  name-calling hurts,  whether you're gay,  straight,  transgender,  or anything in between.  It's just plain wrong,  and schools should do everything they can to stop it.\n\nSometimes,  kids who bully others are actually insecure about their own gender identity.  They pick on others to try and prove they fit in. It's like a messed-up mirror,  where they're trying to make themselves feel better by putting others down.\n\nAnd here's the really important part:  being bullied can lead to serious problems like anxiety,  depression,  and even drug or alcohol use.  It's like a domino effect,  where one bad thing leads to another.  That's why it's so important to help kids who are being bullied and to teach everyone that being different is totally okay! \n\nWe need to create a world where everyone feels safe to be themselves,  without fear of judgment or harm. \n",
    "Within the ancient verses of Leviticus, a shadow falls upon the act of man lying with man,  a practice deemed an \"abomination\" (Leviticus 18:22).  The Apostle Paul, too,  condemns such desires,  declaring them a rejection of the natural order, a burning lust that leads to shame and retribution (Romans 1:27). \n\nYet,  these pronouncements,  steeped in the language of a bygone era, speak of \"intercourse\" and \"lust,\"  not of the love and companionship that define modern understandings of homosexual orientation. Throughout history and across cultures,  same-sex relationships have existed,  yet the concept of \"orientation,\"  as an inherent and immutable aspect of one's identity,  is a relatively recent blossom,  blooming only in the late 19th century (Kuefler 1256).  This temporal gulf makes a direct comparison between ancient condemnations and modern understandings a treacherous path.\n\nFurthermore,  the historical context surrounding these relationships reveals a stark disparity in perception.  Homosexuality,  while present in ancient and medieval societies,  was rarely viewed as a union of equals.  The Christian world,  in particular,  cast a harsh judgment upon those deemed \"sodomites.\"  Execution awaited those found guilty,  the fires of the Inquisition burning brightly in their pursuit.  Byzantium,  under the weight of Justinian's Code,  meted out brutal punishments,  from castration to death.  \n\nThese acts of persecution,  fueled by fervent religiosity,  highlight a fundamental difference in understanding.  Same-sex relationships,  even at the level of philosophical discourse,  were considered a deviation,  a transgression against the established order,  not a reflection of an inherent and unchangeable aspect of one's being. \n\n\n",
    "The framers of the United States Constitution,  while crafting a document that enshrined fundamental freedoms,  harbored a degree of skepticism regarding the average citizen's capacity for active political participation.  They envisioned a republic led by elected representatives,  with citizens playing a more passive role in the political process.  Their concerns stemmed,  in part,  from the limitations of information dissemination in the 18th century,  making it challenging for citizens to stay informed about political affairs.\n\nHowever,  the landscape of political participation has transformed dramatically since the Constitution's inception.  The rise of mass media,  particularly in the 20th and 21st centuries, has created an unprecedented level of access to information.  News outlets,  television programs,  and online platforms provide a constant stream of political news,  analysis,  and commentary,  empowering citizens to stay informed and engaged (\"How Does the Media Affect Politics\"). \n\nFurthermore,  the media serves as a crucial watchdog,  holding those in power accountable and exposing corruption or misconduct.  Journalists and media organizations play a vital role in investigating and reporting on government actions,  allowing citizens to form their own opinions and participate in public discourse (\"How Does the Media Affect Politics\").\n\nWhile the framers may have underestimated the public's interest in political affairs,  today's citizens are far from apathetic.  Numerous organizations dedicated to protecting civil rights and liberties actively monitor the political landscape,  advocating for change and holding elected officials accountable (Jach & Trolian,  2022).  Citizens no longer wait for crises to erupt before voicing their concerns;  they actively engage in the political process,  utilizing their right to free speech and assembly to shape public policy and demand accountability.\n\nThe media plays a pivotal role in facilitating this engagement,  providing a platform for diverse voices and perspectives (Greenberg & Page,  2015).  While crises may heighten public interest in politics,  countless individuals remain committed to staying informed and engaged regardless of the political or economic climate.  \n\nThese individuals,  true champions of democracy,  deserve our respect and admiration.  They embody the ideals of active citizenship,  serving as guardians of our freedoms and ensuring that the government remains accountable to the people it serves. \n\n\n\n",
    "Published in the Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization in July 2021,  Armantier et al.'s article,  \"How Economic Crises Affect Inflation Beliefs: Evidence from the COVID-19 Pandemic,\" examines how public perceptions of inflation shifted during the initial six months of the pandemic.\n\nThe study,  while complementing existing research on the COVID-19 recession's economic impacts, distinguishes itself by:\n\n* Analyzing the pandemic's inflationary effects in comparison to previous economic crises.\n* Surveying households to gauge their evolving perceptions of inflation.\n\nTheir findings reveal a muted overall increase in inflation expectations,  masking a significant polarization of views,  particularly in the short term (Bekaert et al., 2020). Notably,  households with higher education levels initially anticipated low inflation or even deflation as a result of the pandemic (Armantier et al., 2021).\n\nThe study's strength lies in its analysis of a non-traditional economic crisis triggered by a pandemic.  Through comparative analysis with previous crises,  the authors demonstrate how inaccurate inflation assumptions can have cascading effects on other sectors of the economy (Armantier et al.,  2021).  For instance,  the Great Recession,  primarily a demand-driven crisis,  was fueled by declining housing and stock prices.\n\nThe study's key contributions include:\n\n* Evidence of a strong polarization in inflation perceptions during the pandemic.\n* Identification of distinct inflationary expectations among different demographic groups.\n\nThese findings provide valuable insights into the complex interplay between economic crises,  public perceptions,  and the dynamics of inflation. \n",
    "The digital revolution has transformed communication,  with email emerging as a cornerstone of modern interaction.  Its speed, convenience,  and ability to transcend geographical boundaries have revolutionized how we connect with colleagues,  loved ones,  and businesses.  However,  this shift to the digital realm has also brought about subtle yet significant changes in the nature of interpersonal communication.\n\n**Expanding the Scope of Communication:**\n\nEmail has shattered the confines of physical proximity,  allowing communication to flourish across continents and time zones.  Conversations that once required face-to-face meetings or lengthy phone calls can now unfold seamlessly online,  making communication more accessible and efficient.  This expanded scope has opened up new possibilities for collaboration,  relationship building,  and information sharing. \n\n**Redefining Nonverbal Communication:**\n\nHowever,  the transition to email has also altered the role of nonverbal cues.  Body language,  facial expressions,  and tone of voice,  essential elements of face-to-face communication,  are largely absent in the digital realm.  While emojis and stickers offer a limited form of emotional expression,  they are often deemed inappropriate in formal email correspondence (Smith,  n.d.).  This shift necessitates a greater reliance on written language to convey nuance,  emotion,  and intent. \n\n**Advantages of Email Communication:**\n\n* **Accessibility:** Email allows us to connect with people virtually anywhere,  anytime,  breaking down geographical barriers and time constraints.\n* **Limitless Communication:**  Conversations can continue indefinitely,  unconstrained by the limitations of physical meetings or phone calls.\n* **Staying Connected:**  Email allows us to maintain relationships,  share updates,  and stay informed regardless of distance.\n\n**Disadvantages of Email Communication:**\n\n* **Technological Dependence:**  Access to the internet and electronic devices is essential for email communication.\n* **Cybersecurity Risks:**  Email accounts are vulnerable to hacking,  phishing scams,  and other cybersecurity threats.\n\n**Navigating the Digital Landscape:**\n\nThe shift to digital communication has also introduced new challenges.  Individuals often inadvertently carry over habits from face-to-face interactions into the digital realm,  leading to common email etiquette mistakes, including:\n\n* **Ignoring Audience:**  Failing to tailor language and tone to the recipient,  such as using informal language in professional emails.\n* **Lack of Digital Etiquette:**  Neglecting basic email courtesies,  such as using proper greetings and closings.\n* **Confusing Writing Styles:**  Mixing formal and informal language,  creating a jarring reading experience.\n* **Overly Long Messages:**  Sending lengthy,  unstructured emails that overwhelm the recipient. (CNBC,  2018)\n\nTo avoid these pitfalls and maximize the effectiveness of email communication,  it's essential to:\n\n* **Learn Digital Etiquette:**  Familiarize yourself with the rules of professional email communication,  including proper formatting,  tone,  and language.\n* **Proofread Carefully:**  Review your emails for errors,  clarity,  and tone before hitting send.\n* **Tailor Your Style:**  Adjust your writing style and level of formality based on the recipient and the context of the communication. \n* **Be Concise:**  Keep emails brief and to the point,  respecting the recipient's time and attention. \n\nBy embracing these best practices,  we can harness the power of email to communicate effectively,  build relationships,  and navigate the digital landscape with confidence and professionalism. \n",
    "While customer satisfaction and employee engagement are important,  many American executives prioritize financial growth above all else.  This laser focus on profits stems from a simple truth:  financial performance is the ultimate measure of a company's success.  Without profitability,  a company risks failure and closure. \n\nHowever,  achieving sustainable growth requires a careful understanding of the interplay between profitability,  inflation,  capital costs,  and market valuation.  \n\nA key factor in determining a company's optimal growth rate is the relationship between its return on equity (ROE) and the cost of equity capital.  If the projected ROE exceeds the cost of capital,  growth is beneficial,  driving increased value for shareholders.  However,  if ROE falls short of the cost of capital,  rapid growth can actually be detrimental, eroding shareholder value (Fruhan, 2014).\n\nIn such scenarios,  companies facing insufficient earnings and struggling to keep pace with inflation-driven revenue growth should consider slowing their expansion or finding ways to increase profitability.\n\nFurthermore,  to maintain a healthy growth trajectory,  companies must not only keep pace with inflation but exceed it.  For example,  if the inflation rate is 10%, a company must aim for earnings growth above that threshold to remain attractive to investors.\n\nDuring periods of high inflation,  like the one experienced between 1965 and 1981 (Fruhan, 2014),  companies face even greater pressure to achieve substantial growth.  With Treasury bonds yielding around 11% and long-term inflation expectations hovering around 10%,  companies must aim for a growth rate of 19-20% to meet investor expectations and provide a sufficient return on equity capital. \n\nFailing to outpace inflation and meet investor expectations can be disastrous for a company's long-term viability.  Therefore,  businesses must carefully monitor their ROE,  manage their cost of capital,  and align their growth strategies with prevailing economic conditions to ensure sustainable success. \n",
    "The opioid crisis in the United States is a heartbreaking challenge,  touching countless lives and leaving a trail of devastation in its wake.  But amidst this darkness,  hope persists, and the journey toward recovery is possible. \n\nWhile the misuse of prescription opioids and the rise of potent synthetic opioids like fentanyl have fueled this crisis,  leading to a tragic increase in overdose deaths,  we are not powerless in the face of this epidemic.  \n\nEffective treatments,  backed by scientific research and compassionate care,  offer a pathway to healing and a return to a life free from addiction:\n\n* **Substitution Therapy:**  This groundbreaking approach utilizes medications like methadone,  buprenorphine, and naltrexone to provide a safer alternative to highly addictive opioids (Volkow et al.,  2014).  These medications,  carefully administered by medical professionals,  help reduce cravings,  alleviate withdrawal symptoms,  and pave the way for a sustainable recovery.\n* **Holistic Support:**  Overcoming opioid addiction is a journey that requires more than just medication.  Therapies like counseling,  support groups,  and lifestyle changes play a vital role in addressing the underlying causes of addiction and empowering individuals to rebuild their lives.\n\nFamily and friends play a crucial role in supporting loved ones struggling with opioid addiction.  Encouraging them to seek treatment,  providing a loving and supportive environment,  and celebrating their progress can make a world of difference.\n\nRehabilitation centers offer a haven for healing,  providing a structured and supportive environment where individuals can break free from addiction and rediscover the joy of a healthy life (Brown,  2018).  These centers,  equipped with experienced professionals and evidence-based treatment programs,  offer a beacon of hope for those seeking a brighter future. \n\nThe road to recovery from opioid addiction may be challenging,  but it is paved with hope,  compassion,  and the unwavering belief in the power of human resilience.  Together,  we can support individuals on their journey to healing,  creating a brighter future for themselves,  their families,  and our communities. \n\n\n",
    "Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) encompasses a range of policies and practices that organizations implement to ensure their operations benefit all stakeholders, including employees,  customers,  communities,  and the environment.  Effective CSR initiatives contribute to environmental sustainability,  improve societal well-being,  and foster a positive and ethical work environment.\n\n**Employee Engagement and Empowerment:**\n\nOrganizations demonstrating strong CSR often prioritize employee well-being and empowerment.  This can include:\n\n* **Recognition and Appreciation:**  Acknowledging employee contributions through meaningful praise,  awards,  and opportunities for professional development (Yang et al.,  2019).\n* **Autonomy and Trust:**  Providing employees with decision-making authority and fostering a culture of trust (Yang et al.,  2019).\n* **Financial Incentives:**  Offering competitive salaries,  performance-based bonuses,  paid time off,  and other financial rewards.\n\n**Ethical Conduct and Stakeholder Engagement:**\n\nCSR also involves establishing ethical guidelines for business operations,  such as:\n\n* **Code of Ethics:**  Outlining clear expectations for employee behavior regarding ethical conduct,  environmental responsibility,  and customer service.\n* **Supplier Screening:**  Evaluating suppliers to ensure they adhere to ethical sourcing practices and fair labor standards.\n* **Safety and Sustainability:** Implementing robust systems to protect employee well-being,  prevent accidents,  and minimize environmental impact (Tamvada,  2020). \n\n**Continuous Improvement:**\n\nWhile many organizations demonstrate a strong commitment to CSR,  there are always opportunities for improvement.  Encouraging employee creativity through brainstorming sessions and fostering a culture of innovation can enhance CSR initiatives (Tamvada,  2020).  \n\n**Case Study: Nestlé**\n\nNestlé,  a global food and beverage company,  has made significant strides in its CSR initiatives,  particularly in areas of community empowerment,  access to clean water and sanitation,  and promoting healthy lifestyles.  \n\n**Recommendations:**\n\nTo further enhance CSR effectiveness,  companies can implement Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)  processes (Tamvada,  2020).  ERM helps identify potential risks and opportunities,  allowing organizations to proactively manage challenges and ensure their actions align with their CSR goals. \n\nBy embracing a holistic and proactive approach to CSR,  organizations can create a positive impact on society,  enhance their reputation,  and achieve sustainable long-term success. \n\n\n",

    "Neil Foley's book,  \"Mexicans in the Making of America,\"  challenges the conventional narrative surrounding Mexican Americans and their place in US history. In the opening chapter,  \"The Genesis of Mexican America,\"  Foley unveils a history marked by conflict,  misrepresentation,  and the enduring legacy of a contentious border.\n\nFoley argues that the American government,  through deliberate propaganda,  created a harmful stereotype of Mexican immigrants as lazy,  criminal,  and a threat to American society (Foley 34).  This distorted image,  he contends,  has unfairly stigmatized Mexican Americans,  obscuring their rich history and contributions to the nation.\n\nFoley dismantles the myth of American exceptionalism by highlighting the injustices inflicted upon Mexico.  He points out that white settlers in Texas during the 1830s were,  in fact,  illegal immigrants who defied Mexican law (Imery-Garcia 12).  The Mexican-American War of 1846-1848,  a blatant act of aggression by a stronger nation against a weaker neighbor facing economic hardship (Foley 24),  resulted in the annexation of Texas and the dispossession of countless Mexicans.\n\nThe treaty that ended the war offered Mexicans living in the newly acquired territories a choice:  return to Mexico or become US citizens.  While citizenship promised equal rights,  the reality was far different (Gutiérrez 5).  Discrimination and prejudice forced many Mexican Americans to downplay their heritage,  identifying as Spanish American to avoid the stigma attached to their Mexican roots.\n\nFoley's analysis reveals a history often ignored or glossed over in mainstream narratives.  He reminds us of the vibrant Aztec civilization that predated European arrival,  Mexico's early abolition of slavery,  and the unjust seizure of Texas.\n\nThe annexation of Texas,  Foley argues,  created more than just a physical border; it carved a deep chasm of misunderstanding and resentment between the two nations.  This historical wound continues to shape perceptions and fuel tensions,  impacting the lives of Mexican immigrants and Mexican Americans to this day.\n\nIn conclusion,  Foley's first chapter challenges us to confront a history often shrouded in myth and distortion.  It's a powerful call to recognize the contributions of Mexican Americans,  to acknowledge the injustices inflicted upon Mexico,  and to strive for a more just and equitable future for all. \n",
    "Okay, so you know how sometimes you're in a group project or a study session, and there's that one person who just *has* to be the center of attention?  Yeah,  we're talking about the \"show-off.\" \n\nThese folks can seriously disrupt the vibe,  especially in a learning environment.  Imagine trying to focus while someone's constantly interrupting,  bragging, or asking totally random questions just to impress the teacher (Jacobs et al., 2016).  It's like, \"Dude, chill out and let someone else have a turn!\"\n\nIt's easy to get annoyed by show-offs.  They often dominate conversations,  answer every question (even if it wasn't directed at them),  and basically hog the spotlight.  Sometimes they're just insecure or trying to compensate for something,  but it can make everyone else feel frustrated and ignored (Jacobs et al.,  2016). \n\nAnd guess what?  All that non-stop chatter can actually make it harder for the whole group to learn.  It's like trying to study while someone's blasting music in your ear –  you can't concentrate!  \n\nPlus, show-offs can derail the whole group project.  They might go off on tangents,  try to take over everything,  and basically prevent the team from reaching its goal. It's like they're more focused on showing off than actually getting the work done (Forsyth, 2019). \n\nIn short, show-offs can be a real drag on group productivity.  They suck the energy out of the room,  make it hard to focus,  and prevent everyone else from shining. It's all about them, them, them,  and that's not cool. \n\n\n",
    "The COVID-19 pandemic had a devastating impact on the global airline industry,  triggering a cascade of disruptions that reshaped travel patterns,  revenue streams, and operational practices.  \n\n**Government Restrictions and Reduced Demand:**\n\nThe initial outbreak of the virus in early 2020 led to widespread travel restrictions,  border closures, and quarantine measures implemented by governments worldwide (\"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Aviation,\" 2022).  These measures,  while necessary to curb the spread of the virus,  severely impacted air travel demand.  Passengers,  facing travel bans,  testing requirements,  and economic uncertainty,  opted to stay home,  leading to a dramatic decline in passenger numbers.\n\n**Economic Fallout:**\n\nThe sharp decrease in demand resulted in a staggering loss of revenue for the airline industry,  estimated at $372 billion in 2020  (\"Economic impacts of covid-19 on Civil Aviation,\" 2021).  This unprecedented financial shock forced airlines to implement drastic cost-cutting measures,  including flight cancellations,  staff layoffs,  and route reductions.  The number of available seats plummeted by 50%,  and passenger traffic decreased by 2.7 billion  (\"Economic impacts of covid-19 on Civil Aviation,\" 2021).\n\n**Cargo as a Lifeline:**\n\nWhile passenger travel nosedived,  the air cargo sector proved more resilient.  The demand for medical supplies,  personal protective equipment,  and other essential goods transported by air actually increased during the pandemic (Nižetić, 2020,  p. 10953). This surge in cargo traffic provided a much-needed revenue stream for some airlines,  partially offsetting the losses incurred in passenger operations.\n\n**A Gradual Recovery:**\n\nAs vaccines became available and travel restrictions eased in 2021,  the airline industry began a slow but steady recovery.  Passenger confidence gradually returned,  and demand for air travel increased. While revenue losses in 2021 remained substantial ($324 billion),  the trend indicated a positive shift,  suggesting a brighter future for the industry.\n\n**Looking Ahead:**\n\nThe airline industry continues to navigate the complexities of the post-pandemic world,  adapting to new travel patterns,  evolving regulations,  and the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the virus.  While the road to full recovery remains challenging,  the industry's resilience,  coupled with the pent-up demand for travel,  offers a glimmer of optimism for a brighter future. \n\n\n",
    "Imagine stepping into a virtual world,  a meticulously reconstructed crime scene where every detail,  every fracture,  every bullet trajectory,  comes to life with startling realism. This is the promise of haptic technology in forensic science,  a groundbreaking innovation that's poised to revolutionize criminal investigations.\n\nResearchers,  armed with cutting-edge modeling software and a haptic device that mimics the sense of touch,  have embarked on a journey to unlock the secrets hidden within skeletal remains.  Their case studies,  spanning from bone fractures in traffic accidents to gunshot wounds,  read like a forensic thriller,  offering a glimpse into the transformative power of this technology (Buck et al.,  2008).\n\nThe haptic device,  with its remarkable precision,  low friction,  and six degrees of freedom,  allows investigators to virtually \"feel\"  the evidence,  manipulating 3D digital models of bones as if they were holding the actual remains.  It's a game-changer,  offering a level of immersion and interaction that was previously unimaginable.\n\nThis innovation holds immense potential for both post-mortem examinations and criminal investigations.  Imagine recreating a crime scene with unprecedented accuracy,  determining the angle of a gunshot or the force of a blow with stunning precision.  Haptic technology can accelerate the criminal justice process,  provide more reliable evidence,  and ultimately,  bring perpetrators to justice more swiftly and effectively (Hagmann et al.,  2021).\n\nHowever,  this technological leap forward is not without its challenges. The high cost of equipment and the specialized training required for personnel (Fahrni et al.,  2019)  raise concerns about accessibility,  particularly for under-resourced law enforcement agencies.  \n\nFurthermore,  the potential for cyberattacks and data manipulation (Joukal et al.,  2015)  underscores the need for robust security measures to ensure the integrity of evidence and maintain public trust in this transformative technology.\n\nDespite these challenges,  the potential of haptic technology in forensic science is undeniable.  It's a testament to human ingenuity,  a fusion of science and technology that empowers us to unlock the secrets hidden within the silent language of bones,  bringing us closer to a future where justice is served swiftly and accurately. \n\n\n",
    "Imagine a community reclaiming its heritage,  its traditions vibrantly alive,  its identity strengthened through the power of self-determination.  This is the transformative potential of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act,  a landmark piece of legislation that has empowered Native American tribes to reshape their destinies.\n\nThis act,  far from simply legalizing gambling,  represents a profound step towards recognizing tribal sovereignty and the right of tribes to chart their own course. By granting tribes the authority to determine the types of gaming activities they wish to engage in,  the act acknowledges their inherent right to self-governance (Light and Rand). \n\nThis newfound control extends beyond economic benefits;  it reaches into the very heart of tribal culture.  Traditional tribal games,  steeped in history and meaning,  can now flourish,  strengthening cultural identity and fostering a sense of connection to ancestral roots. These games,  passed down through generations,  become more than just entertainment;  they are living expressions of tribal sovereignty,  a testament to the enduring power of cultural heritage.\n\nImagine a tribe gathering for a traditional game,  laughter mingling with the rhythmic beat of drums,  ancestors honored,  and community bonds strengthened.  This is sovereignty in action,  a tangible expression of self-determination,  a powerful reminder that tribal culture is not a relic of the past but a vibrant force in the present.\n\nEven for those tribal members who venture beyond their communities,  embracing the opportunities of the modern world,  traditional gaming serves as a powerful touchstone.  It offers a connection to their roots,  a reminder of their heritage,  and a source of pride in their unique identity.\n\nThe Indian Gaming Regulatory Act,  while often discussed in economic terms,  represents a much deeper victory. It's a testament to the resilience of Native American cultures,  a beacon of hope for self-determination,  and a powerful step towards a future where tribes can thrive,  their sovereignty recognized and respected. \n",
    "Balancing individual freedoms with national security is a fundamental challenge in any democracy.  While some argue that national security should sometimes override individual rights,  this essay contends that individual freedoms should *never* be sacrificed in the name of national security.\n\nThe very essence of democracy lies in prioritizing individual freedoms,  which are enshrined in documents like the US Constitution (Longley).  As President Joe Biden aptly stated, \"democracy is the key to freedom, prosperity,  peace,  and dignity\" (Biden 3).  Unlike authoritarian regimes that prioritize state power,  democracies place the rights and well-being of their citizens above abstract notions of national security.\n\nHowever,  striking this balance is not always easy. There are no universal rules, and each situation requires careful consideration.  Fortunately,  in most areas of social life,  from immigration to economic policy to international relations,  individual freedoms are generally protected.\n\nCybersecurity policy provides an interesting example.  While national security interests are certainly a factor,  modern approaches emphasize a \"human-centric\"  perspective,  aiming to protect individual rights and freedoms online (Deibert 411, 412).  This demonstrates that it's possible to prioritize both individual freedoms and national security without sacrificing one for the other.\n\nThose who argue that national security should trump individual freedoms often cite external threats or the need for strong national defense.  However,  this argument is flawed. True national security should protect the rights and freedoms of *every* citizen,  not just an abstract idea of the \"nation.\"  Each individual is a part of the nation,  and their liberties are essential to a healthy and functioning democracy.\n\nAuthoritarian regimes often exploit the guise of national security to suppress dissent and consolidate power,  serving the interests of the ruling elite rather than the well-being of the people.  In contrast,  democracies recognize that individual freedoms are fundamental,  non-negotiable rights that must be upheld under all circumstances.  These freedoms are the bedrock of a free and just society,  ensuring that the government remains accountable to the people it serves. \n\n\n",
    "## Net Present Value (NPV):  A Powerful Tool for Investment Decisions\n\nNet Present Value (NPV)  is a crucial metric used to evaluate the profitability of potential investments. It represents the difference between the present value of cash inflows and the present value of cash outflows over a specific period. Essentially,  it calculates the expected profit an investor will earn from a project after recouping all associated costs.  \n\n**Advantages of NPV:**\n\nNPV offers several advantages over other investment criteria:\n\n1. **Considers the Time Value of Money:** NPV recognizes that money received today is worth more than the same amount received in the future due to inflation and potential earning opportunities. It incorporates discount rates to reflect this principle,  providing a more accurate assessment of an investment's true value.\n\n2. **Flexibility and Additivity:** NPV is flexible and additive, meaning it can be used to evaluate both individual projects and combinations of projects.  This allows investors to compare different investment opportunities and select the most profitable portfolio. \n\n3. **Accounts for Investment Size:**  NPV considers the scale of the initial investment,  allowing for a more accurate comparison of projects with different capital requirements.  \n\n**Key Features of NPV:**\n\n* **Time Horizon:** NPV calculations take into account a specific time horizon,  making it a more dynamic and informative metric than static measures like payback period.\n* **Cost of Capital:**  NPV incorporates the cost of capital,  reflecting the opportunity cost of investing in one project over another.\n* **Expected Value:** NPV is based on the concept of expected value,  recognizing that future cash flows are subject to uncertainty.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nNPV is a powerful and versatile tool for making informed investment decisions.  Its ability to account for the time value of money,  flexibility in evaluating multiple projects,  and consideration of investment size make it a superior metric for assessing profitability and maximizing returns. \n",
    "In the battle against COVID-19,  nations have grappled with finding effective strategies to contain the virus's relentless spread.  While Iceland's approach,  characterized by rapid testing and a resilient community spirit,  yielded positive results,  its applicability to larger,  more geographically complex NATO countries is questionable.\n\nThe Icelandic model,  though commendable,  relied on unique factors:  a relatively small and isolated population,  strong community cohesion, and the financial capacity to implement widespread testing.  Replicating this approach across sprawling NATO countries, with their diverse populations,  porous borders, and varying economic resources,  presents significant challenges.\n\nImagine attempting to implement Iceland's rigorous testing regime across the vast expanse of the United States or the interconnected nations of Europe.  The logistical hurdles,  the sheer volume of tests required,  and the potential strain on healthcare systems would be immense.  Furthermore,  ensuring widespread public compliance with such measures,  especially in nations where individual liberties are fiercely protected,  would be a daunting task.\n\nHowever,  a glimmer of hope emerges from Israel's innovative approach.  Their deployment of digital epidemiological investigation,  a cutting-edge technology that tracks potential contacts of infected individuals (Amit et al., 2020),  offers a potential solution to the limitations of the Icelandic model.\n\nThis digital tracking system,  while raising privacy concerns,  could potentially circumvent the challenges of border control and resource constraints.  By leveraging technology to identify and monitor potential outbreaks swiftly,  nations could implement targeted interventions,  minimizing disruptions to daily life and preventing widespread lockdowns.\n\nHowever,  adopting such a system would require significant investment in infrastructure,  both domestically and through international collaboration.  Developing robust digital platforms,  ensuring data security,  and addressing ethical considerations surrounding privacy would be paramount. \n\nThe fight against COVID-19 demands a global effort,  a willingness to embrace innovative solutions,  and a commitment to investing in the tools and technologies needed to protect our communities.  While the Icelandic model may not be universally applicable,  its success highlights the importance of rapid response and community engagement.  Israel's digital approach,  on the other hand,  offers a potential blueprint for leveraging technology to overcome logistical barriers and enhance our ability to track and contain the spread of infectious diseases. \n",
    "Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, deep socioeconomic divides in the United States created unequal access to employment opportunities.  However, the pandemic amplified these disparities,  revealing a stark contrast in experiences.  \n\nThose with higher education levels,  particularly graduate degrees,  were more likely to maintain stable employment through remote work.  In contrast,  individuals without college degrees faced job losses,  reduced hours,  and a lack of financial safety nets (Blustein et al., 2020).\n\nThis disparity highlights the role of power and privilege in determining employment security,  with inequalities evident across racial,  gender,  and educational lines (Blustein et al., 2020).  One of the most significant divides lies between those with and without a college education (Galea & Abdalla, 2020). \n\nWithin this educational gap,  race and ethnicity play a crucial role.  Black Americans,  in particular,  face systemic racism in areas like hiring,  housing,  and daily life,  leading to persistent marginalization (Galea & Abdalla, 2020). This systemic disadvantage translates into unequal job opportunities and a more precarious economic reality.\n\nThe uneven recovery from pandemic-induced unemployment further underscores these disparities.  While the overall unemployment rate in the US has declined from its peak of 14.7% in April 2020 to 4% currently (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2022),  the recovery has not been equitable.\n\nFor Black Americans,  the unemployment rate reached a staggering 16.8%  in April 2020,  highlighting their disproportionate vulnerability to economic shocks. While this rate has since declined to 6.9%  in January 2022,  it remains significantly higher than the national average and reflects a slower and more challenging recovery (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2022).  \n\nIn contrast,  the unemployment rate for white Americans declined more rapidly,  falling from 14.1% in April 2020 to 6.0%  by October 2020.  This faster recovery is attributed to factors like higher levels of education,  access to stable jobs,  and stronger support networks (Galea & Abdalla, 2020).\n\nThese statistics paint a stark picture of the unequal impact of economic crises and the enduring legacy of systemic racism in the United States.  Addressing these deep-rooted inequities is essential for creating a more just and equitable society where all individuals have equal opportunities to thrive. \n",
    "In Olga Tokarczuk's captivating novel, \"Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead,\"  the protagonist, Janina Duszejko,  uses language as a weapon,  a tool to dissect the world around her and unveil the hidden truths beneath the surface. Her idiosyncratic use of nicknames,  far from being a mere quirk,  offers a window into her complex personality and foreshadows her role in the unfolding mystery.\n\nFrom the very first page,  Janina's unconventional approach to naming becomes apparent.  She rejects the notion of fixed identities,  believing that \"each of us sees the other person in our own way,  so we should give them the name we consider suitable.\"  She embraces the concept of \"polyonymy,\"  assigning nicknames that reflect her subjective perception of each individual. \n\nHer friend becomes \"Oddball,\"  instantly painting a picture of eccentricity in the reader's mind,  whether accurate or not.  The murder victims,  too,  are stripped of their given names,  transformed into \"Big Foot,\"  \"Commandant,\" and \"Inner,\"  reduced to the traits that Janina finds most salient.  \n\nThis linguistic manipulation extends to animals,  but with a striking contrast.  When choosing a name for a rescued dog,  Janina opts for \"Marysia,\" a human name,  rejecting typical pet names as unsuitable given the dog's \"personal history.\"  This reveals a deep empathy for animals,  a recognition of their individuality and suffering that she seems to withhold from humans.\n\nThe juxtaposition of Janina's naming practices unveils her underlying values.  Humans are judged,  categorized,  and often ridiculed through her nicknames,  while animals are granted dignity and a deeper understanding.  This skewed perspective,  coupled with her untrustworthy narration,  hints at her potential involvement in the murders.  Her fierce love for animals,  combined with her disdain for those who mistreat them,  suggests a motive that aligns with the victims' shared passion for hunting. \n\nThrough her unique use of language,  Janina reveals her worldview –  a world where humans are flawed and often cruel,  while animals are innocent victims deserving of protection.  This distorted lens,  while obscuring the truth,  also provides clues,  allowing the reader to piece together the puzzle of Janina's motivations and her role in the unsettling events that unfold. \n",
    "This article about John Smeaton, the English engineer who designed all those cool bridges and lighthouses, is pretty interesting.  The author,  Andrew Morris,  talks about how Smeaton used this thing called \"parameter variation,\"  not just to improve engineering stuff,  but as a whole way of thinking and problem-solving (Morris,  2021).  \n\nMorris is like,  \"Smeaton wasn't just making things better; he was connecting science and technology in a totally new way!\"  He argues that Smeaton used experiments to test out theories and come up with his own rules for how things work (Morris,  2021).\n\nAnd I'm with Morris on this one. Smeaton was a total innovator.  He didn't just build stuff;  he figured out *why*  things worked the way they did.  He was a scientist and an engineer all rolled into one!\n\nNow,  there's this old debate about whether science actually mattered during the Industrial Revolution.  Some folks,  like Musson and Robinson,  say science was super important (Morris, 2021).  But this other guy,  Hall,  thinks technology just kind of happened on its own,  without any help from science. \n\nHonestly,  I think Hall is missing the point.  The Industrial Revolution was this crazy explosion of new ideas and inventions.  It wasn't just about building bigger and better machines;  it was about understanding the science behind them and using that knowledge to create a whole new world. \n\nThink about electricity!  At first,  people used natural sources like wind and water.  But then,  thanks to guys like Smeaton,  we figured out how to harness the power of steam. That breakthrough was a game-changer,  and it wouldn't have happened without a deep understanding of science. \n\n\n",
    "Washington state boasts a low uninsured rate of 6.6% (as of 2019),  significantly lower than states like Oklahoma (14.9%)  and Texas (18.4%) (Kaiser Family Foundation, n.d.). This suggests a strong correlation between socioeconomic factors and access to healthcare.  Individuals with limited financial resources often face barriers to obtaining quality care,  leading to delayed treatment and reliance on emergency services.\n\nWashington's robust economy,  with ample job opportunities,  likely contributes to its low uninsured rate. Additionally, residents tend to be well-informed about healthcare options,  and the state has a higher concentration of healthcare facilities compared to rural areas.\n\nHowever,  disparities in healthcare access persist,  influenced by factors like ethnicity,  education, and community context. While Washington offers a more inclusive environment for diverse populations, other regions struggle with racial prejudice,  limiting access to quality education and well-paying jobs,  which in turn impacts healthcare access. \n\nAddressing these systemic inequalities is crucial for ensuring equitable healthcare access for all, regardless of socioeconomic status or background. \n",
    "Kantian ethics,  a shining example of non-consequentialist thought,  offers a powerful framework for understanding morality and guiding ethical action.  Its principles,  rooted in the pursuit of universal moral laws,  provide a compelling alternative to consequentialist theories like utilitarianism,  which prioritize outcomes over inherent rightness. \n\nAt the heart of Kantian ethics lies the categorical imperative,  a beacon of moral guidance that illuminates the path toward ethical behavior (Kant & Abbott,  2021).  This imperative speaks directly to the individual,  urging them to act in accordance with universal moral principles,  regardless of personal desires or potential consequences.\n\nKant emphasizes the importance of aligning our actions with these principles,  treating them as unwavering guides for ethical decision-making.  These principles,  derived from pure practical reason,  transcend individual circumstances and subjective biases,  offering a foundation for a truly just and moral society (Kant & Abbott, 2021).\n\nKant's philosophy challenges the notion of moral relativism,  where ethical principles are fluid and subject to individual interpretation.  He argues that genuine morality must be absolute and universal,  unbound by personal interests or situational contingencies (Kant & Abbott,  2021).\n\nThis unwavering commitment to universal moral law creates a compelling tension within Kantian ethics.  While individuals inevitably operate within the context of specific circumstances and develop their own subjective maxims for behavior,  Kant urges us to transcend these limitations and strive to align our actions with the categorical imperative. \n\nThe challenge,  then,  lies in bridging the gap between the universal and the particular,  between the ideal of absolute moral law and the realities of human experience.  While some may argue that this tension renders the categorical imperative a mere idealistic aspiration,  Kant's philosophy offers a powerful call to action,  urging us to strive for a world where ethical principles guide our choices and shape a more just and moral society. \n\n\n",
    "Here are the main points of the text, restructured for clarity:\n\n**Two Approaches to Language Study:**\n\n* **Prescriptive Approach:** This approach focuses on establishing and enforcing rules for \"correct\" language use, often based on formal grammar and standardized language.  It aims to maintain linguistic consistency and clarity. \n* **Descriptive Approach:**  This approach observes and describes how language is actually used,  acknowledging variations,  dialects,  and evolving language patterns without imposing rigid rules.\n\n**Value of Both Approaches:**\n\n* **Prescriptive Approach:** Provides a framework for standardized communication,  essential for clarity and understanding,  particularly in formal contexts.\n* **Descriptive Approach:**  Captures the dynamic nature of language,  documenting how it evolves and adapts within different social groups and contexts. \n\n**Common Misconceptions About Language Change:**\n\n* **Change Equals Deterioration:** Older generations often perceive language change as a decline in standards,  but historical evidence shows that this resistance to change is a recurring theme across generations (Crystal, 1987).\n* **Blame on Education and Media:**  While some attribute language change to declining education quality or media influence,  these factors are not always directly responsible for linguistic shifts. \n\n**Language Change as a Natural Process:**\n\n* **Language is constantly evolving,  reflecting societal changes and the creativity of its users.**  This organic process cannot be controlled by rigid rules.\n* **Resistance to change is often rooted in fear and a desire for stability and familiarity.**  However,  embracing language's dynamic nature allows for greater expressiveness and adaptability.\n\n\n",
    "In today's rapidly evolving global landscape,  the very nature of leadership is undergoing a profound transformation.  The technological and information revolutions have empowered businesses to operate on a global scale,  creating unprecedented opportunities and challenges for aspiring leaders.\n\nHere are key insights for future business leaders navigating this dynamic environment:\n\n**1.  Embrace a Global Mindset:**\n\nForget about limiting your ambitions to local markets.  To thrive in the 21st century,  leaders must cultivate a global mindset,  envisioning their companies as key players on the world stage.  This shift in perspective requires a deep understanding of cultural nuances,  adaptability to diverse markets,  and a relentless pursuit of global leadership.\n\n**2. Master Cultural Intelligence:**\n\nCultural differences are not just interesting trivia;  they are powerful forces that shape leadership styles and organizational effectiveness.  Future leaders must develop cultural intelligence,  the ability to navigate diverse communication styles,  decision-making processes,  and motivational techniques across cultures.  \n\n**3.  Embrace Transformational Leadership:**\n\nTransformational leadership,  characterized by vision,  inspiration,  and a commitment to empowering others,  is essential for success in a globalized world (Bonsu & Evans,  2018).  Transformational leaders possess the charisma and discernment to inspire their teams,  transforming expectations,  motivations,  and ultimately,  achieving extraordinary results.  \n\n**4.  Seek Cross-Cultural Experiences:**\n\nThe best leaders are not born;  they are forged through experience.  Exposure to diverse cultures,  whether through international assignments,  collaborations,  or immersive travel,  is crucial for developing a global mindset and honing cultural intelligence (Ratanjee,  2021).\n\nIn conclusion,  the future of leadership demands a global perspective,  cultural sensitivity,  and a transformative approach to inspiring and empowering teams.  By embracing these principles,  aspiring leaders can navigate the complexities of the global marketplace,  drive innovation,  and achieve sustainable success. \n\n\n",
    "While the terms \"goals\" and \"objectives\" are often used interchangeably,  they represent distinct levels of planning and action.  Goals,  as defined by Nickels et al. (2019), are broad,  long-term aspirations that an organization seeks to achieve.  Objectives,  on the other hand,  are specific,  measurable,  and time-bound strategies that pave the path toward those goals.\n\nThe criminal justice system exemplifies this distinction.  Its overarching goals,  such as deterrence,  rehabilitation,  retribution,  restoration,  and incapacitation,  provide a framework for addressing criminal behavior and protecting public safety.  These goals are then translated into specific objectives,  guiding the actions of police,  correctional agencies,  and the courts.\n\nIn today's rapidly evolving world,  effective leadership and management are crucial for the criminal justice system to adapt and thrive.  Leaders,  with their visionary thinking and ability to inspire change,  guide the system towards its goals.  Managers,  on the other hand,  implement structured processes,  coordinate resources,  and ensure that objectives are met efficiently and ethically (Nickels et al.,  2019).\n\nFor instance,  police leaders must set high ethical standards and inspire their officers to work towards a shared vision of justice.  Meanwhile,  criminal justice managers optimize operations,  streamline processes,  and ensure that legal and ethical considerations are balanced in all actions.\n\nPursuing a degree in criminal justice is a significant step towards achieving my long-term goal of becoming a transformative leader in this field.  My passion for driving positive change,  coupled with a strong educational foundation,  will empower me to make a meaningful contribution.\n\nTo further enhance my effectiveness,  I aim to develop two key skills:\n\n* **Adaptability to Change:**  The criminal justice system faces increasingly complex challenges.  Developing a flexible and adaptable mindset will enable me to navigate these complexities and implement innovative solutions. \n* **Strengthened Relational Skills:**  Collaborating effectively with diverse professionals and serving a wide range of individuals requires strong interpersonal and communication skills.  \n\nBy combining my passion for leadership with a deep understanding of the criminal justice system and a commitment to continuous growth,  I aspire to make a positive impact on this vital field. \n",
    "The video highlights the importance of understanding and supporting people with disabilities.  One powerful moment shows a child named Samuel hitting a t-ball while sitting down,  teaching another boy that people with disabilities can still achieve great things.  \n\nIt's important to treat everyone equally and give everyone the chance to succeed,  regardless of their abilities.  The video shows that disabled children can thrive in regular classrooms with the right support.\n\nParents of disabled children face extra challenges in ensuring their children get the best education and opportunities.

Could there be a connection?  Was this a modern-day Diogenes,  rejecting material comforts in pursuit of a simpler life?\n\nThe article delved into the professor's story,  revealing a complex web of motivations.  He spoke of his desire to live sustainably,  to minimize his environmental footprint,  and to challenge societal norms around consumption.  The story also touched on his recent divorce,  adding a layer of personal intrigue.  Had this life upheaval pushed him towards such a radical downshift? \n\nAs I scrolled further,  photos of the dumpster's surprisingly cozy interior captured my attention.  It wasn't the squalor I had imagined;  it was a thoughtfully designed micro-home,  complete with a bed,  a desk,  and even a composting toilet.  \n\nSuddenly,  the idea of dumpster living didn't seem so outlandish.  Perhaps it could be a temporary escape,  a retreat from the noise and clutter of everyday life.  But the lack of a proper kitchen and bathroom gave me pause.  Could I really embrace such a minimalist lifestyle?\n\nProfessor Wilson's unconventional choice sparked a wave of questions within me.  It challenged my assumptions about comfort,  necessity,  and the meaning of home.  While I may not be ready to trade my apartment for a dumpster just yet,  his story serves as a powerful reminder that there are countless ways to live a meaningful life,  and sometimes,  the most unexpected paths lead to the most profound discoveries. \n",
    "While both lookism and extreme body modification stem from society's often unattainable and unhealthy beauty standards, they differ significantly in their expression and consequences.\n\nLookism is the act of judging individuals based on their appearance,  specifically when their looks deviate from prevailing ideals. It involves directing negativity towards those who don't conform to societal norms,  essentially externalizing one's own insecurities about beauty onto others.\n\nExtreme body modification, on the other hand, is the deliberate alteration of one's physical appearance to a degree that challenges societal expectations (Good, 2016).  It's a personal act, often driven by a desire to express individuality or conform to specific cultural pressures.\n\nThe key distinction lies in the direction of focus. Lookism criticizes outward appearances, while extreme body modification focuses on altering one's own body.  \n\nWhile less visible than physical alterations, lookism often reveals a deeply unhealthy relationship with self-image.  Obsessing over others' features or grooming habits can be a sign of deep-seated insecurity (Good, 2016).\n\nExtreme body modification, however, can be driven by personal choice,  social pressure,  or long-held cultural traditions. The ancient Chinese practice of foot binding,  for example,  aimed to make women's feet smaller and more aesthetically pleasing,  reflecting a cultural ideal rather than individual choice.\n\nIt's worth noting that women disproportionately bear the burden of extreme body modification expectations. In many cultures,  women are pressured to conform to specific beauty standards to enhance their perceived worth and marriageability. \n\n\n",
    "Niccolò Machiavelli's \"The Prince\" stands as a groundbreaking work in political philosophy,  boldly challenging the idealistic visions of ancient thinkers.  While traditional political thought often focused on utopian ideals and perfect governance,  Machiavelli delves into the gritty reality of power,  where morality takes a backseat to the pursuit and preservation of authority.\n\n\"The Prince,\"  a guidebook for aspiring rulers,  explores the intricacies of monarchical rule and the strategies needed for political survival.  Machiavelli (2014)  provides a pragmatic,  even ruthless,  framework for navigating the treacherous waters of politics,  emphasizing that the ultimate goal is to maintain power,  even if it requires morally questionable actions.\n\nThis work,  which gave rise to the term \"Machiavellian,\"  shocked many with its unflinching realism.  Machiavelli (2014)  dismantles the traditional notion of a ruler serving the common good,  replacing it with a vision of a self-serving leader driven by ambition and a willingness to employ any means necessary to achieve their goals.\n\nThis emphasis on pragmatism and self-interest echoes the philosophy of Thomas Hobbes,  who famously argued that human nature is inherently selfish.  Hobbes believed that individuals are driven by a relentless pursuit of personal gain,  a perspective often criticized for its cynicism and oversimplification. \n\nWhile Hobbes's view offers valuable insights into human motivation,  it's undeniable that human nature is far more complex than a simple equation of self-interest.  Countless individuals and organizations dedicate their time and resources to helping others,  demonstrating compassion,  altruism,  and a desire for something beyond personal gain.\n\n\"The Prince,\"  while controversial,  remains a seminal work in political thought,  forcing us to confront the often-uncomfortable realities of power and the moral compromises that accompany its pursuit.  It serves as a reminder that the world of politics is rarely black and white,  and that understanding the nuances of human behavior is essential for navigating its complexities. \n",
    "The concept of organizational culture, a powerful force shaping an institution's identity and values,  can be understood through a layered lens,  revealing both its visible manifestations and its hidden depths.  Edgar Schein's groundbreaking work,  later expanded upon by Edward Granter,  identifies four distinct levels of organizational culture:  super-structural,  symbolic,  discursive,  and cognitive (Granter, 2019). These levels,  influenced by external forces,  visible artifacts,  explicitly stated values,  and underlying assumptions,  create a complex tapestry that defines an organization's character.\n\nAn analysis of Macomb Community College through this framework reveals a compelling story of tradition,  order,  and a deep commitment to community engagement. \n\n**Artifacts:  A Legacy of Learning and Innovation:**\n\nThe college's physical environment,  a blend of modern chrome-plated structures and a stately central building nestled amidst a tranquil park,  speaks to its commitment to both technological advancement and the timeless pursuit of knowledge.  This architectural duality suggests a balanced approach to education,  embracing both the sciences and the humanities.  \n\nThe highly developed bus route system,  serving as a lifeline for students,  highlights Macomb's dedication to accessibility and fostering a strong sense of community. \n\n**Values:  Order,  Composure,  and Commitment:**\n\nSignage throughout the college,  from parking instructions to library guidelines,  emphasizes order and structure,  suggesting that Macomb values discipline,  attentiveness,  and a commitment to academic rigor.  \n\n**Underlying Assumptions:  A Need for Greater Openness?**\n\nWhile Macomb's emphasis on order and tradition is evident,  a deeper analysis of its underlying assumptions reveals a potential area for growth.  The college's website,  lacking in flashy appeals or lighthearted community engagement initiatives,  suggests a more reserved and formal approach.  This could indicate an undervaluing of openness,  spontaneity,  and the expression of diverse identities.\n\n**Recommendations for Growth:**\n\nTo further enhance its already strong cultural foundation,  Macomb Community College should consider embracing a greater degree of openness in its interactions and communications.  While upholding its commitment to academic excellence and community values,  the college could benefit from fostering a more welcoming and inclusive environment that celebrates diverse perspectives and encourages creative expression.  \n\nBy balancing its existing strengths with a greater appreciation for openness and individuality,  Macomb can create an even more enriching and supportive learning environment for all its members. \n\n\n",
    "\"The Epic of Gilgamesh,\" often considered the world's oldest surviving work of literature, explores the timeless themes of mortality, friendship, and the complex relationship between humans and gods. \n\nThis ancient story,  dating back over 4,000 years, predates even the Bible (Anneberg Learner, 2021). It centers around Gilgamesh,  the arrogant king of Uruk,  who is two-thirds god and one-third human.  \n\nTo humble Gilgamesh, the gods create Enkidu,  a wild man who becomes Gilgamesh's equal and closest friend.  Through their adventures,  Gilgamesh learns the value of companionship and the \"wonderful\" nature of human connection (Anneberg Learner, 2021).\n\nHowever,  tragedy strikes when Enkidu dies,  forcing Gilgamesh to confront his own mortality.  He embarks on a desperate quest for immortality,  seeking to defy the fate that awaits all humans.  His journey teaches him that immortality is reserved for the gods,  while humans are destined to die.  \n\nAlthough Gilgamesh fails to achieve eternal life,  he gains wisdom and a deeper understanding of the preciousness of life.  He returns to Uruk a changed man,  accepting his mortality and cherishing the legacy he will leave behind.\n\nThe enduring power of \"The Epic of Gilgamesh\"  lies in its exploration of universal themes that continue to resonate with readers today.  It reminds us of the importance of friendship,  the inevitability of death,  and the enduring search for meaning in a world where our time is limited. \n\n\n",

Some are awesome at building towers,  others are great at making drawbridges,  and some are super creative with decorations.\n\nBut what if your friends get bored or lose interest?  The castle won't get built, or it might end up looking wonky!  That's where motivation comes in. It's like the secret sauce that keeps everyone excited,  focused,  and working together to reach a goal.\n\nIn a company,  managers are like the team captains.  Their job is to keep everyone motivated and working towards a common goal,  just like when you're building that awesome LEGO castle. \n\nHere's why motivating people is so important:\n\n* **Happy Workers,  Happy Company:** When people feel good about their work and are excited to contribute,  they do a better job. It's like when you're really into building something –  you put in extra effort and the results are amazing!\n* **Teamwork Makes the Dream Work:**  Managers need to make sure everyone is working together like a well-oiled machine. If someone is feeling down or uninspired,  it can throw the whole team off track. \n* **Reaching for the Stars:**  If people aren't motivated,  it's harder for a company to reach its goals. It's like trying to build a castle with only half the bricks –  it's not going to be as impressive. \n\nSo, how do managers motivate their teams? Well, it's like figuring out what makes each of your friends tick.  Some might be motivated by praise,  others by rewards,  and some just need to feel like their ideas are valued.\n\nGreat managers understand their team members and use different strategies to keep everyone happy,  engaged,  and working together to build something awesome –  just like that epic LEGO castle!  \n",

    "Mary Breckinridge was one tough lady.  She went through some seriously rough times,  losing her first husband and then both of her children.  But instead of letting those tragedies break her,  she dedicated her life to helping others and making sure no one else had to experience the pain she did.  Talk about inspiring!\n\nMary was born way back in 1881 and had a pretty interesting life.  Her dad was a congressman and even worked as the US Minister to Russia, so she grew up all over the place (Breckinridge, 2021).  \n\nAfter her first husband passed away, she decided to become a nurse (Breckinridge, 2021).  She tried to have a family again, but sadly, her two kids died shortly after they were born (Breckinridge, 2021).  It was a devastating loss, but Mary didn't give up.  She left her second husband and volunteered as a nurse during World War I.  That's when she realized she wanted to spend her life saving lives (Breckinridge, 2021). \n\nMary focused on helping people in Kentucky,  even going back to school to learn more about nursing and midwifery (Breckinridge, 2021).  In 1925,  she started this awesome organization called the Frontier Nursing Service (FNC)  that helped tons of mothers and babies stay healthy (Brewer, 2018).  She's actually considered the first person to bring nurse-midwifery to the US! (Brewer, 2018).\n\nEven after she passed away,  Mary's legacy lives on. People from all over the world come to the FNC School of Midwifery and Family Nursing to learn from her incredible work (Brewer,  2018).  \n\nMary Breckinridge is a total role model.  She shows us that even in the face of unimaginable hardship,  we can choose to help others and make the world a better place.  Her story is a reminder that we all have the power to make a difference,  no matter what challenges life throws our way. \n\n\n",
    "The landscape of nursing education is evolving,  its horizons expanding to embrace new levels of knowledge and expertise.  While traditional Bachelor's degrees have long served as the entry point into this vital profession,  the rise of Master's programs in nursing marks a pivotal shift,  reflecting the growing complexity and demands of 21st-century healthcare.\n\nBut what is the true value of a Master's degree in nursing?  Does it simply build upon the foundation laid by a Bachelor's,  or does it unlock a new realm of possibilities for aspiring nurses?\n\nImagine a young nurse,  fresh from their Bachelor's program,  equipped with the fundamental skills and knowledge needed to provide competent care. They are a skilled practitioner,  capable of navigating the demands of their role.  But a Master's program offers a transformative journey,  a path to becoming not just a skilled nurse,  but a leader,  an innovator,  and a driving force for positive change. \n\nHere's how a Master's degree in nursing empowers nurses to reach new heights:\n\n* **Sharper Minds,  Bolder Decisions:**  Master's programs cultivate critical thinking skills,  honing the ability to analyze complex situations,  make sound judgments under pressure,  and confidently navigate the ethical and social dimensions of healthcare (Bryant-Moore et al., 2018).  They empower nurses to step into leadership roles,  shaping policies and advocating for their patients.\n* **Emotional Intelligence,  Compassionate Care:**  A Master's in nursing goes beyond textbooks and clinical skills;  it nurtures emotional intelligence,  the ability to understand and manage emotions,  both their own and their patients'. This fosters a deeper connection with patients,  allowing nurses to provide truly patient-centered care (Cassano et al.,  2020).\n* **Research Pioneers,  Shaping the Future:** Master's programs equip nurses with the tools and knowledge to engage in scientific research,  driving innovation and shaping the future of healthcare.  Imagine nurses leading groundbreaking studies,  discovering new treatments,  and advocating for evidence-based practices that transform patient outcomes.\n\nA Master's degree in nursing is not just an academic achievement;  it's a transformative journey that elevates nurses from skilled practitioners to visionary leaders,  compassionate caregivers,  and research pioneers,  shaping a brighter future for the nursing profession and the patients they serve. \n\n\n",
    "The landscape of melanoma treatment has undergone a dramatic transformation in recent years,  offering newfound hope for patients facing this once-devastating disease.  While melanoma, a particularly aggressive form of skin cancer,  was once a virtual death sentence for those with metastatic disease,  innovative therapies have emerged,  dramatically improving survival rates and even offering the possibility of long-term remission.\n\nAt the forefront of this revolution are immune checkpoint inhibitors,  powerful drugs that unleash the body's own immune system to attack cancer cells.  Combined with targeted therapies like BRAF/MEK inhibitors for patients with specific genetic mutations,  these treatments have extended lives and allowed some patients to achieve lasting remission,  even discontinuing therapy altogether (Poklepovic & Luke, 2019,  p. 1166).\n\nThis breakthrough offers immense hope for individuals like Mr. B.,  diagnosed with stage II melanoma.  A decade ago,  his prognosis would have been far less optimistic.  But today,  with access to these innovative treatments,  he has a significantly higher chance of achieving long-term remission.\n\nAdjuvant therapy,  treatment given after the initial surgery to reduce the risk of recurrence,  has also emerged as a crucial tool in the fight against melanoma.  While earlier adjuvant therapies,  like interferon-α2b,  were often considered ineffective due to their toxicity and limited efficacy,  newer options have proven more successful (Jenkins & Fisher, 2021,  p. 27).\n\nIn Mr. B.'s case,  adjuvant therapy could have potentially prevented the recurrence of his melanoma,  highlighting the importance of these treatments in preventing the disease's return.\n\nThis remarkable progress in melanoma treatment underscores the power of scientific innovation and the unwavering commitment of researchers and clinicians to finding new and effective ways to combat this challenging disease.  For patients facing a melanoma diagnosis,  these advancements offer a beacon of hope,  a chance for a longer,  healthier life. \n",
    "Imagine a journey of spiritual growth,  a path illuminated by faith,  wisdom,  and the unwavering support of a trusted guide.  This is the essence of Christian mentoring,  a practice deeply rooted in the very heart of the faith,  where discipleship and spiritual companionship have flourished for centuries.\n\nWhile the term \"mentoring\" may be relatively new within church circles,  the act of guiding and nurturing others in their faith is as old as Christianity itself.  From the earliest days of the church,  spiritual coaching,  discipleship,  and the profound bonds of Christian friendship have woven a tapestry of support and encouragement.\n\nMallison (1998), in his insightful work on Christian mentoring,  beautifully captures its essence,  describing it as \"a dynamic,  intentional relationship of trust in which one person enables another to maximize the grace of God in their life and service\" (p. 8).  He reminds us that mentorship is not an optional add-on but an essential ingredient for spiritual growth,  a testament to the relational and collectivist nature of the Christian faith.\n\nDrawing inspiration from the ultimate mentor,  Jesus Christ,  Mallison emphasizes the importance of investing in the spiritual and personal development of others.  He challenges the notion of the solitary Christian,  the \"pious particle\"  isolated from the community,  and reminds us that true growth flourishes within the context of loving relationships (Mallison,  1998, p. 34).\n\nChristian mentoring is a transformative journey,  a sacred dance between mentor and mentee,  where biblical wisdom,  prayerful guidance,  and genuine encouragement intertwine to nurture spiritual growth. It's a process fueled not by obligation but by a heartfelt desire to see others flourish in their faith and walk closer with God.\n\nImagine a church community where seasoned believers embrace the role of mentors,  guiding new disciples with wisdom and compassion,  helping them navigate the challenges of faith and discover the fullness of God's grace.  This is the vision Mallison paints,  a vision where mentorship becomes a cornerstone of spiritual growth,  transforming lives and strengthening the bonds of Christian community. \n\nWhile the book primarily focuses on the positive aspects of mentoring,  it also acknowledges the potential for harm in unhealthy mentoring relationships.  This raises a crucial question:  how can the Christian model of mentorship address and prevent destructive coaching,  ensuring that the process remains a source of healing and empowerment? \n",
    "Analyzing the rhetorical techniques employed by public figures can provide valuable insights into effective communication. By studying how these individuals utilize language to persuade and inspire, we can learn valuable lessons applicable to our own communication.\n\nThis analysis focuses on Michelle Obama's opening remarks at the White House Convention on Food Marketing to Children, a speech aimed at raising awareness about the harmful effects of unhealthy food advertising targeted at young people. \n\nObama masterfully employs two key rhetorical appeals to drive home her message:  logic and emotion.\n\n**Logic:**\n\nTo establish a rational foundation for her argument,  Obama cites compelling evidence.  She highlights the positive impact of previous efforts to reduce childhood obesity,  stating that \"between 2008 and 2011, obesity rates among low-income preschoolers dropped in 19 states and territories across the country\" (Read Michelle Obama's Speech on Food Marketing para. 10).  This statistic demonstrates the tangible benefits of promoting healthy lifestyles and underscores the need for continued action.\n\n**Emotion:**\n\nObama also connects with her audience on an emotional level.  She acknowledges the progress made while emphasizing the urgency of the issue,  stating that \"while we have made important progress, when one in three kids is still on track to develop diabetes, and when the diet has now surpassed smoking\" (Read Michelle Obama's Speech on Food Marketing para. 11).  This powerful statement evokes a sense of concern and responsibility,  urging listeners to take action to protect the health of future generations.\n\nBy skillfully weaving together logic and emotion,  Obama delivers a persuasive and memorable speech.  Her use of evidence strengthens her argument, while her heartfelt appeal to the audience's values and concerns amplifies the impact of her message.  This analysis highlights the effectiveness of these rhetorical strategies in shaping public opinion and inspiring positive change. \n",
    "Defining what it means to be human is complex.  Some believe it's about independence and self-reliance, while others focus on the things that separate us from animals, like using technology,  wearing clothes,  and working.  Ultimately,  everyone has their own unique perspective on what constitutes a meaningful human life.\n\nIn the \"On Being\" podcast,  Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh offers a profound perspective on this question.  He emphasizes the importance of compassion and understanding,  stating that \"we have to remain human to be able to understand and to be compassionate\" (Onbeing.org 30:53 – 30:58).\n\nHanh acknowledges that humans are fallible and make mistakes,  but he stresses the importance of learning from our errors and striving to live more mindfully (Onbeing.org 31:15 – 31:20). For him,  being human is about embracing our humanity –  our capacity for both kindness and error,  our ability to learn and grow.\n\nHe also laments the state of the modern world,  where violence,  division,  and a lack of meaningful communication prevail (Onbeing.org). He suggests that people yearn for a life free from anger and negativity,  a life where mindfulness and emotional regulation guide our actions.\n\nWhile achieving this ideal state of being can be challenging in today's world,  Hanh's message is a source of inspiration.  His insights into mindfulness and compassion,  even for those who don't share his Buddhist beliefs,  offer valuable guidance for navigating the complexities of human existence. \n\n\n",
    "In his book,  \"The Passing of Traditional Societies,\"  Daniel Lerner draws upon a decade of fieldwork and interviews across the Middle East to explore the process of modernization.  He argues that all societies,  regardless of their cultural backgrounds,  ultimately move towards a \"Western model\"  of modernity, characterized by secularization,  urbanization,  and industrialization. \n\nLerner's analysis focuses on the transformative effects of these processes,  particularly the rise of population mobility,  the spread of literacy,  and the influence of mass media.  He identifies ethnocentrism,  the tendency to view one's own culture as superior,  as a major obstacle to modernization. \n\nLerner contends that the \"stimuli\"  for modernization originated in the West,  setting a path for developing nations to follow (Lerner 47).  He contrasts traditional societies with modern ones,  suggesting that clinging to cultural identity hinders progress and efficiency.  \n\nHowever,  Lerner's modernization theory,  a product of the post-World War II era,  has been criticized for its oversimplification and linear view of history (Dunmire 23).  Its reliance on a single \"Western\"  model fails to account for the diverse paths to development taken by nations like China,  Russia,  and Cuba.\n\nIn the modern era,  Lerner's paradigm has lost much of its relevance.  The complexities of globalization,  the rise of alternative development models,  and the recognition of cultural diversity have challenged the simplistic assumptions of modernization theory. \n\n\n",
    "You know how there are tons of clothing stores out there, all selling clothes? It's a crazy competitive market, but they all try to stand out somehow. That's what we call monopolistic competition –  lots of companies selling similar stuff,  but each trying to make their products seem special.\n\nThey do this by branding their clothes,  like coming up with catchy names and logos,  and by running cool ads that highlight what makes their stuff unique.  Think about the different designs,  the fabrics they use,  and even the prices they charge (Davis and Özgür, 4).  \n\nTheir ads might focus on tangible things like colors,  patterns,  sizes,  or how stretchy the fabric is (Davis and Özgür, 7).  They also play up intangible aspects,  like promising high quality,  free shipping,  or a money-back guarantee.  It's all about making their clothes seem irresistible!\n\nNow,  imagine a different kind of market,  like the steel industry.  There,  it's a whole different ball game. A handful of big companies rule the roost –  that's called an oligopoly (Ritz 185).  They set the trends and prices,  and sometimes they even team up to dominate the market. \n\nThese big players compete by constantly improving their products,  adjusting prices,  and advertising their unique features. But here's the twist:  if one of the big guys lowers their prices,  the others usually don't follow suit.  They'd rather focus on making their products even better so they can justify charging higher prices (Ritz 187).\n\nTo keep the competition out,  these leading companies set the bar super high.  They produce top-notch quality steel,  charge a premium for it,  and churn out huge quantities (Ritz 189).  It's like they're saying, \"If you want to play in our league,  you better bring your A-game!\"  This makes it really tough for smaller or newer companies to break into the market. \n\n\n",
    "Moral relativism proposes that ethical truths are fluid,  shaped by context,  culture,  and individual experiences,  rather than being anchored to absolute standards.  In contrast, moral universalism posits that a shared human nature,  particularly our capacity for empathy and reasoned persuasion,  forms the foundation for universal ethical principles.\n\nWhile these two concepts stand in stark opposition,  several arguments point to the inherent flaws and inconsistencies within moral relativism.\n\nFirstly,  despite attempts to defend relativism,  its proponents often inadvertently fall back on universal moral principles,  contradicting their own premise.  They may argue for tolerance and understanding,  essentially advocating for a universal ethical framework that values respect for diverse perspectives.\n\nSecondly,  relativists often cite cultural variations in values as evidence for moral relativity.  However,  this argument inadvertently reinforces the existence of universal standards.  By claiming that cultures develop different ethical codes,  they implicitly acknowledge the universality of the human need for moral guidance.\n\nMoral universalism,  on the other hand,  argues for a consistent ethical system that applies to all individuals,  regardless of their background or beliefs.  This concept is supported by the observation that all enduring moral codes,  across diverse cultures and throughout history,  share a core set of values,  such as respect for life,  health,  property,  and personal dignity.  \n\nSeveral factors strengthen the case for moral universalism:\n\n* **Foundation in Human Nature:**  Moral relativism relies on exceptions and variations,  while moral universalism grounds itself in the shared human experience,  explaining the similarities in ethical codes across cultures.  Fundamental moral prohibitions,  such as the prohibition against murder,  are recognized almost universally.\n* **Necessity for Social Order:**  If morality were truly relative to each individual, as relativism suggests,  establishing a stable and just society would be impossible.  Universal moral principles provide a framework for cooperation,  conflict resolution,  and the protection of individual rights.\n\nTherefore,  moral universalism offers a more coherent and compelling explanation for the existence and persistence of ethical principles across diverse human societies. \n\n\n",
    "Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed colleagues,\n\nToday, we delve into the intricate character of Mr. Das from Jhumpa Lahiri's poignant novel, \"Interpreter of Maladies.\" Mr. Das, initially presented as a seemingly benevolent and relatable figure,  ultimately evokes a sense of profound disappointment due to his stagnation and his inability to confront the disintegrating relationships within his family.\n\nWhile Mr. Das exhibits moments of kindness and gentleness, particularly in his interactions with his wife,  a closer examination reveals a deeply flawed individual.  His consistent avoidance of meaningful engagement with his family,  as exemplified by his retreat into a tour book during a pivotal conversation with Mr. Kapasi,  highlights his emotional detachment and unwillingness to acknowledge the growing rift within his marriage.\n\nThis failure to confront the palpable unhappiness surrounding him becomes the tragic flaw in Mr. Das' character arc. He remains trapped in a state of blissful ignorance,  blind to the emotional needs of his wife and children.  This willful blindness erodes the initial empathy we feel for him,  transforming our perception from sympathy to a sense of frustration and ultimately,  disdain.\n\nMr. Das,  despite his relatable struggles and the humanizing glimpses into his internal world,  fails to evolve.  His inability,  or perhaps unwillingness,  to recognize and address the profound disconnect within his family leaves the reader with a sense of bitter disappointment. \n\nHowever,  Mr. Das' flawed trajectory offers a valuable lesson.  His story underscores the critical importance of introspection,  open communication,  and the courage to confront uncomfortable realities within our relationships.  Through his failings,  Mr. Das teaches us the importance of active engagement, empathy,  and the ongoing pursuit of connection within the intricate tapestry of family life. \n",
    "##  Supplier Evaluation and Selection: A Critical Component of Manufacturing Success\n\nThis article reviews various methodologies and criteria used in supplier evaluation and selection,  a crucial process for manufacturing companies striving for efficiency and strategic partnerships.  The article highlights a shift in focus within the industry –  from prioritizing operational efficiency to recognizing the strategic importance of supplier relationships.  Selecting the right suppliers is now seen as a key driver of a company's growth and competitiveness.\n\n**MCDM Approaches to Supplier Selection:**\n\nThe article focuses on Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM)  approaches,  which utilize various techniques to evaluate and rank suppliers based on multiple criteria. Some common methodologies include:\n\n* **Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA):**  This method analyzes a supplier's overall efficiency based on selected criteria,  classifying them as either efficient or inefficient.\n* **Mathematical Programming Models:**  These models utilize complex calculations to compare suppliers across multiple criteria,  identifying the most cost-effective and optimal choices.\n* **Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP):**  AHP helps prioritize and weigh different criteria based on their relative importance,  providing a structured framework for decision-making. \n* **Simple Multi-Attribute Rating Technique (SMART):**  SMART assigns weights to different criteria and scores suppliers based on their performance against those criteria. \n\n**Popularity and Distribution:**\n\nThe article analyzes the prevalence of these methodologies in academic literature,  revealing a clear preference for DEA,  which accounts for 30% of mentions.  Mathematical programming (17%), AHP (15%), and case-based reasoning also represent a significant portion of MCDM approaches.

    "Ancient Rome,  a sprawling empire that stretched across continents,  was a melting pot of cultures,  a vibrant tapestry woven from the threads of diverse traditions,  beliefs,  and languages.  This multicultural character,  far from being incidental,  played a crucial role in Rome's remarkable success.\n\nRecent genetic studies have revealed the astonishing diversity of the Roman population,  demonstrating closer ties to Mediterranean populations than to those of Western Europe (Thomsen,  2019).  This genetic mosaic reflects the empire's vast reach,  encompassing a multitude of cultures,  from the Gauls and Greeks to the Syrians,  Egyptians,  Lebanese,  Persians, and countless others.\n\nScholars attribute much of Rome's cultural and economic prosperity to its ability to embrace and integrate diverse ethnic and national identities.  Instead of imposing a monolithic culture,  Rome often adopted and adapted elements from the civilizations it encountered,  creating a dynamic and evolving cultural landscape.\n\nThe Pax Romana, a period of unprecedented peace and prosperity that lasted for approximately two centuries,  exemplifies this approach.  With Roman conquests largely concluded,  a multitude of cultures flourished under the umbrella of Roman rule. While Rome certainly exerted its influence,  it largely allowed conquered populations to maintain their own customs,  religions,  laws,  and even taxation systems (Brooks,  2019). This tolerance and pragmatism fostered stability and facilitated the flow of ideas,  technologies,  and trade throughout the empire.\n\nAmong the many cultures that shaped Roman civilization,  Ancient Greece stands out as a profound influence.  From the grandeur of Roman architecture to the philosophical underpinnings of its legal system,  the echoes of Hellenistic culture resonate throughout Roman society.  The Romans,  recognizing the intellectual and artistic achievements of the Greeks,  embraced their legacy,  adapting and building upon it to create their own unique cultural identity.  This influence extended to realms of science,  literature,  law,  economics,  and even military strategy.\n\nAnother significant influence came from the Etruscans,  a powerful civilization that predated Rome in the Italian peninsula.  The Etruscans,  skilled traders and artisans,  had close ties to the Greeks,  acting as a conduit for Hellenistic culture to flow into early Roman society (Brooks,  2019).  Furthermore,  the Etruscans,  with their own loose confederation of city-states and a strong military tradition,  shaped Rome's early development,  instilling a sense of military prowess and ambition that would fuel its expansionist drive.\n\nRome's ability to embrace and synthesize diverse cultural influences,  transforming them into a unique and enduring civilization,  stands as a testament to its remarkable adaptability and its enduring legacy. \n",
    "From the dawn of humanity,  we have woven tales of gods and monsters,  heroes and villains,  using symbols and myths to make sense of the world and our place within it.  These stories,  passed down through generations,  carry a potent magic,  a power that resonates deep within the human soul.  It's no wonder that even in the modern world,  iconic brands have tapped into the allure of mythology,  infusing their products with a touch of the extraordinary.\n\nVersace,  the embodiment of bold and glamorous fashion,  chose the head of Medusa,  the mythical Gorgon with snakes for hair,  as its emblem.  Gianni Versace,  the brand's visionary founder,  saw in Medusa a captivating blend of beauty and simplicity,  a creature whose gaze could mesmerize and transfix,  much like the alluring designs he created.\n\nLamborghini,  born from the rugged world of tractor manufacturing,  adopted the powerful bull as its symbol.  This magnificent creature,  associated with Zeus,  the king of the gods,  embodied strength,  power, and untamed energy –  qualities that perfectly mirrored the high-performance supercars that would become the brand's signature. \n\nBut the myth that truly captures my imagination is the tale of Prometheus,  the defiant titan who dared to steal fire from the gods and gift it to humanity.  His act of rebellion,  a testament to his boundless compassion,  freed humans from the shackles of ignorance and ushered in an era of knowledge and progress.\n\nPrometheus,  like a master craftsman,  taught humanity to write,  to count,  to build ships that could conquer the vast oceans,  and to heal the sick (Travis,  2021).  He empowered humans to shape their own destinies,  breaking free from the capricious whims of the gods.\n\nThis audacious act enraged Zeus,  who condemned Prometheus to an eternity of torment.  Chained to a rock,  his flesh scorched by the sun and lashed by rain,  he endured unimaginable suffering as a giant eagle tore at his liver each day (Travis, 2021).\n\nBut even in the face of such cruelty,  Prometheus's spirit remained unbroken.  His sacrifice,  a testament to his unwavering belief in humanity's potential,  became a symbol of hope and resilience.  And ultimately,  the hero Heracles,  embodiment of strength and compassion,  freed Prometheus from his torment,  restoring balance to the world.\n\nThe myth of Prometheus resonates deeply, reminding us that even in the face of overwhelming adversity,  the pursuit of knowledge,  the fire of human ingenuity,  and the unwavering spirit of compassion can ultimately triumph. \n",

Multiple signaling molecules,  including Sonic hedgehog,  fibroblast growth factor 2,  and glutamate,  play crucial roles in neurogenesis within the ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ)  and the subgranular zone (SGZ),  two key germinal regions of the adult brain.\n\nSignificantly,  NSC differentiation within the V-SVZ is influenced by both local signals from neighboring cells and distant signals from neurons,  the choroid plexus,  and the vasculature (Obernier & Alvarez-Buylla,  2019,  p. 1).  This complex interplay of signaling pathways underscores the intricate nature of NSC regulation and its potential for therapeutic manipulation. \n\n**(Schedule for the Completion of Tasks to be added based on the specific timeline)**\n\n\n",
    "Imagine two ships,  laden with hopes and dreams,  setting sail across the vast Atlantic,  carrying English colonists to a new world.  Their destinations:  the fertile shores of the Chesapeake Bay and the rugged coast of New England.  These two regions,  while both shaped by the ambitions of English settlers,  would embark on strikingly different paths,  their destinies forged by contrasting motivations and the enduring influence of faith.\n\nIn the Chesapeake,  the lure of wealth fueled the Virginia Company,  a joint-stock enterprise determined to carve a profit from the American wilderness.  While dreams of gold and silver proved elusive,  the discovery of a \"golden leaf\" – tobacco –  transformed the region's fate (Corbett et al.,  2022).  Young,  single men,  driven by the promise of economic opportunity,  flocked to the Chesapeake,  toiling on vast tobacco plantations that would become the backbone of the colony's economy.\n\nNew England,  however,  was a different story.  Here,  the settlers were not driven by gold but by a yearning for spiritual freedom.  Fleeing religious persecution and the perceived moral decay of England,  they sought to create a \"city upon a hill,\"  a model of Puritan piety and virtue (Corbett et al.,  2022).  Entire families braved the perilous journey,  establishing self-sustaining communities built on small farms,  bustling villages,  and a diversified economy.\n\nReligion,  a powerful force in both regions,  shaped their destinies in distinct ways.  New England became a haven for various Protestant denominations,  each seeking to establish a godly commonwealth in the New World (Corbett et al.,  2022).  Massachusetts,  Rhode Island,  and other colonies emerged as testaments to their unwavering faith.\n\nEven in the profit-driven Chesapeake,  religion played a role,  albeit a more pragmatic one.  The Anglican Church,  England's established faith,  saw in the native populations a chance for conversion,  a means of extending their influence and forging alliances.  The famous marriage of John Rolfe to Pocahontas,  a symbol of cultural exchange and uneasy coexistence,  exemplifies this approach (Tsukada,  2020).\n\nThe contrasting paths of New England and the Chesapeake Bay reveal the complex interplay of economic ambition,  spiritual yearning,  and the enduring power of faith in shaping the early American colonies.  Their stories,  interwoven with threads of both unity and division,  continue to shape the cultural and political landscape of the United States to this day. \n",

    "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)  is a serious mental health condition characterized by intrusive thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive behaviors (compulsions).  These symptoms cause significant distress and interfere with daily life,  making OCD a debilitating disorder.\n\nThe \"four Ds\" –  distress,  dysfunction,  danger, and deviance –  help illustrate the severity of OCD:\n\n* **Distress:**  OCD sufferers experience intense anxiety and distress due to their intrusive thoughts and the overwhelming urge to perform compulsions,  even though they recognize their irrationality (Van Leeuwen et al.,  2020).\n* **Dysfunction:**  OCD significantly disrupts daily life.  Obsessive thoughts interfere with work, relationships,  and routine activities,  while compulsions consume time and energy (Van Leeuwen et al.,  2020).\n* **Danger:**  OCD can pose a danger to individuals due to the risk of self-harm,  suicidal thoughts,  and extreme anxiety.  While the fear of harming others is common in OCD,  actual violence towards others is rare (O’Connor & Aude, 2019).\n* **Deviance:**  OCD symptoms,  by their very nature,  deviate from typical behavior and thought patterns.  However,  the degree of deviance varies significantly among individuals (Davis,  2009).\n\nIt's crucial to recognize that OCD is a treatable condition. Professional help from therapists and psychiatrists can provide individuals with the tools and strategies needed to manage their symptoms and live fulfilling lives. \n\n\n",

    "Osteoarthritis,  a silent thief of mobility and joy,  casts a long shadow over the lives of millions worldwide.  Imagine the relentless ache of joints,  the stiffness that greets each morning,  the simple pleasures,  like a walk in the park or a hug from a grandchild,  transformed into painful ordeals. This debilitating disease,  a leading cause of disability in older adults,  robs individuals of their independence,  diminishing their quality of life and casting a financial burden on families and society as a whole.\n\nThe economic cost of osteoarthritis is staggering,  reaching an estimated $303 billion annually in the United States alone,  a consequence of mounting medical bills and lost productivity (Abramoff & Caldera, 2020).  Yet,  despite its profound impact,  osteoarthritis is often overlooked and misunderstood.\n\nImagine the smooth,  cushioning cartilage within your joints,  allowing for effortless movement,  gradually wearing away,  like a tire losing its tread. This is the hallmark of osteoarthritis,  a degenerative disease that slowly erodes the protective layer at the ends of bones,  leading to pain,  stiffness,  and inflammation.  \n\nWhile cartilage has a remarkable ability to withstand stress,  its capacity for repair is limited,  even after minor injuries.  Over time,  the damage extends beyond the cartilage itself,  affecting the entire joint, including the synovium,  ligaments,  and underlying bone. \n\nThe tragedy of osteoarthritis is compounded by a pervasive sense of therapeutic nihilism,  the mistaken belief that it's an inevitable part of aging and that effective treatments are elusive (Abramoff & Caldera, 2020).  This misconception,  shared by both patients and some healthcare providers,  leads to a cycle of neglect,  where proven interventions like exercise,  weight management,  and patient education are often overlooked.  \n\nInstead,  we see a reliance on expensive,  unproven medications,  often prescribed for late-stage disease when their impact is limited.  This misguided approach not only fails to address the underlying causes of osteoarthritis but also perpetuates a sense of hopelessness and resignation among those affected.\n\nRehabilitation counseling,  with its holistic approach to addressing both the physical and psychological impacts of osteoarthritis,  offers a beacon of hope.  Imagine a world where individuals with osteoarthritis are empowered to manage their pain,  improve their mobility,  and regain control over their lives.  This is the vision we must strive for –  a world where osteoarthritis is no longer a silent thief of joy, but a condition that can be effectively managed,  allowing individuals to live full and active lives. \n\n\n",
    "Overpopulation in cities is a pressing issue demanding immediate attention.  It's a multifaceted challenge with far-reaching consequences for both the environment and the social fabric of urban areas.  Uncontrolled urban growth strains resources,  exacerbates pollution,  and can lead to increased poverty and social unrest.  However, proactive measures can effectively mitigate these challenges and create more sustainable and equitable urban environments.\n\n**Combating Pollution:**\n\nOne of the most visible consequences of overpopulation is traffic congestion,  a major contributor to air pollution.  Vehicle emissions,  particularly sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides,  pose significant health risks and contribute to climate change.  To combat this,  we must prioritize sustainable transportation solutions:\n\n* **Public Transportation Investment:** Expanding and improving public transportation systems,  making them more accessible,  affordable,  and efficient, will encourage people to choose alternatives to private vehicles. \n* **Infrastructure Development:**  Building new roads and optimizing existing infrastructure can alleviate traffic bottlenecks and reduce congestion.\n\n**Addressing Poverty and Inequality:**\n\nOverpopulation can exacerbate poverty,  especially among vulnerable populations migrating from rural areas seeking better opportunities.  Lack of education and skills often relegates these individuals to low-paying service jobs,  perpetuating a cycle of poverty and social exclusion (Innes et al., 2019).  Addressing this requires a multi-pronged approach:\n\n* **Education and Skills Training:** Investing in education and job training programs empowers individuals with the skills needed for higher-paying jobs,  creating pathways to economic mobility.\n* **Affordable Housing Initiatives:**  Expanding access to affordable housing options can alleviate the financial burden on low-income families and prevent homelessness.\n* **Anti-Discrimination Measures:**  Combating prejudice and discrimination in hiring,  housing,  and other areas of life is essential for creating a more equitable and inclusive society. \n\n**Waste Management Solutions:**\n\nThe sheer volume of waste generated by densely populated urban areas presents a significant environmental challenge.  Effective waste management strategies are crucial:\n\n* **Recycling and Composting Programs:**  Promoting widespread adoption of recycling and composting can significantly reduce landfill waste and promote resource conservation.\n* **Waste-to-Energy Technologies:**  Investing in advanced waste-to-energy facilities can convert waste into renewable energy,  reducing reliance on fossil fuels. \n\nBy implementing these proactive and comprehensive strategies,  we can mitigate the negative impacts of overpopulation,  create more sustainable cities,  and ensure that urban environments remain vibrant,  healthy, and equitable for all.  \n\n\n",
    "Panama uses the US dollar as its official currency,  a system known as dollarization.  This unique arrangement stems from the Balboa, Panama's national currency,  being pegged to the US dollar at a 1:1 ratio.  The US dollar has been legal tender in Panama since the country's early days.\n\nWhile some might view Panama as a high-inflation country due to this arrangement,  dollarization offers significant advantages.  Panama benefits from the stability and global acceptance of the US dollar,  shielding it from the volatility of fluctuating exchange rates and reducing the risk of hyperinflation.  This stability makes Panama an attractive destination for investment and tourism.\n\nResearch suggests that dollarized economies can experience lower inflation and may even be less susceptible to global financial shocks,  although they remain vulnerable to real economic disruptions  (Bakari & Mabrouki,  2017).  It's unclear, however,  whether Panama's robust financial sector is a direct result of dollarization or its increasingly competitive and globalized banking industry.\n\nPanama's strategic location as a key maritime hub,  home to the Panama Canal,  further strengthens its relationship with the United States.  A significant portion of the canal's traffic involves goods destined for or originating from the US (Park et al.,  2020). \n\nThe US-Panama Trade Promotion Agreement,  a free trade agreement between the two nations,  further facilitates economic ties. This agreement eliminates or phases out tariffs on a wide range of goods traded between the two countries,  including automobiles,  machinery,  aircraft,  agricultural products,  and pharmaceuticals (Park et al.,  2020).  \n\nThis robust trade relationship is exemplified by the exchange of key agricultural products,  such as corn and bananas,  between the two nations. \n"
