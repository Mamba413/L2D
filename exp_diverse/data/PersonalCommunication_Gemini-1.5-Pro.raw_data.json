It seems I have radar helping me spot new friends.\nWell, that's something I've never heard of. But if you ask me what I value most in a friend, I would say honesty.\nI agree. You can't expect a close relationship with a dishonest person. Those are the people that will turn their back on you when you are in need.",

To tell you the truth, I plan to apply for Harvard after graduation from high school. It’s better to get to know it. What about you?\nI get together with my Christian brothers on Saturdays.\nOh, my God! John, I didn’t know you are religious. You just look like a scientific kook, like Leonard in the Big Bang Theory.\nCome on, Han Maimed, don’t make a fuss. A lot of Americans, including many scientists, believe in religion.\nBut I’m really surprised. I thought science and religion are not compatible, are they?\nYes, they are compatible. Actually, the U. S. is both the most developed and the most religious country in the world.\nI've heard about it a little bit before, but I don’t understand. How can people believe in God since they know God doesn't exist?\nThat’s a little complicated. You’ll get to know it when you are acquainted with the U. S. history later on. Religion was and is a part of American people’s life. Guess what? Even Harvard University, which is a highly academic institution, is in a sense the product of religion.\nReally?\nAbsolutely! It was founded by a group of Puritan immigrants from England.\nWhy was it founded by the Puritans? Where were the atheistic educators?\nBecause most of the first English immigrants who came to the United States were Puritans.\nHow come? I mean why most of them were religious people?\nThat’s because in the 16th and 17th century, there was a series of religious reforms in England. Many religious separatists were persecuted and fled to other countries.\nSo, you mean people didn't enjoy religious freedom in England?\nYes, that's why Puritans moved to the New World, where they believed they could establish a heaven for Puritans. Later on, it was these Puritans who founded Harvard College.\nWhy did they want to found a college?\nMany Puritans had received classic style of higher education in Oxford University and Cambridge University back in England. They hoped that their descendants could receive this kind of education as well.\nOh, I see.\nActually Harvard was first named'New College', without a formal name.\nWhen did it begin to be called Harvard University?\nIn 1639, it was renamed after its major benefactor John Harvard. Interestingly, JohnHarvard himself was a clergyman.\nIt seems that Harvard was predestined to be influenced by religion.\nTherefore, it’s not exaggerate to claim that had there not been religion, there would note Harvard.\nWow, I didn’t know that religion had played such an important role in Harvard history.\nReligion has been playing an indispensible part in Harvard history as well as the U. S.\nI finally begin to get to know Harvard. It seems that my knowledge of Harvard is rather poor. I have a lot work to do before applying for Harvard.\nRemember that Harvard is a part of the United States. So you have to know the U. S. history and culture if you want to have in-depth knowledge of Harvard. The two are closely related.\nThat’s right. I have a lot to learn from you.",

That’s some pretty unscientific language there. Sounds more religious to me.\nIt’s all religion. Take the theory of the Big Bang.How is it possible that all of the stuff in the universe comes from an explosion?

Someone to show you the ropes?\"\n\n\"Oh yeah, they had coaches there straight from the State Sports folks - super legit!\" \n",

What party?\" A wave of confusion washed over me. \"Your birthday was Saturday?\"\n\n\"Yeah! You didn't know? I sent you an email invite last week.\"\n\nMy mind raced. \"An email? Are you sure? I don't remember seeing anything...\" Then it hit me. \"Wait! I never gave you my new email address! Ugh, Ben, I am so sorry!\" \n\n\n",

I plan to enroll in courses at a local university to fully immerse myself in the culture and further my studies.\" \n\n\"That sounds rigorous!  But a fantastic opportunity.\"\n\n\"Indeed.

Besides,\" she added, tilting her head towards the window, \"what's that I see? Dark clouds gathering? A storm's coming!\"\n\nI couldn't help but grin. \"Awesome! Looks like we get to stay inside after all.\" \n\n\"Not so fast, young man,\" Mom chuckled. \"Those flowers won't water themselves!\" \n",

I'm thinking a fierce dragon on my arm, or maybe a powerful tiger across my back - what do you think?\"\n\n\"I get that they're trendy, but it's a HUGE decision!

Tell me all about him!  What's he like?\"\n\n\"You know, I didn't think much of it at first, but he's actually hilarious! We had so much fun just laughing and talking.  The best part is how much we have in common - same favorite sports team, same taste in music...and get this, we're both obsessed with Chinese food! I have a feeling we're going to be great friends.\"\n\n\"It sounds like you two really clicked.  What do you look for in a friend, anyway?\"\n\n\"Honestly, I don't have a specific checklist or anything. It's more of a feeling I get. I can usually tell right away if someone has the potential to be a good friend. Like I've got this internal radar or something!\"\n\n\"That's a pretty cool skill to have.  Me, I really value honesty in a friend. That's gotta be the foundation for a strong bond.\"\n\n\"Couldn't agree more.  Honesty and trust are essential.

    "\"Lifelong learning is such a hot topic these days, but it seems like everyone has a different interpretation.  What does it mean to you?\"\n\n\"For me, it's about embracing the idea that we never stop learning and growing, no matter our age. It's not about being stuck in a classroom, but rather having a curious mind and being open to new experiences, skills, and perspectives throughout our lives.\" \n\n\"So it's more about your mindset than, say, constantly studying textbooks?\"\n\n\"Exactly!

Some people worry about kids spending too much time on screens, though.  What do you think?\"\n\n\"Honestly, I can get pretty absorbed in them, haha.

People are rushing to buy before prices climb even higher.\"\n\n\"The government needs to step in and cool things down before this gets out of hand.\" \n\n\"Tell me about it! Those sky-high housing prices are putting a real strain on ordinary people.\" \n\n\n",
    "\"Ugh, celebrities have it SO easy!  Tons of cash, everyone worships them...must be nice.\" \n\n\"Dude, are you kidding? Paparazzi up in their grill 24/7? Sounds like a nightmare.\"\n\n\"Nah, they secretly love the attention.  All that complaining just gets them MORE famous.\" \n\n\"I disagree.  I bet most of them just want the focus to be on their work, not their personal lives.\"\n\n\"No way, they're all attention hogs!  More fame equals more movies, more parties, more money! And the best part?  They never have to pay for drinks!\" \n\n\"Okay, but being famous is expensive!  Those mansions and designer outfits don't come cheap.  You think they actually *like* wearing that stuff?  I bet they'd rather be in jeans and a t-shirt.\"\n\n\"You're seriously defending celebrities? They're overpaid and overexposed. Give me a break.\"\n\n\"Hey, some of them are really talented! And they work hard.  Plus, a lot of them give back to charity.\"\n\n\"Oh please, that's just for show.  More good PR for them.\"  \n",
    "\"Well, hello there! What a pleasant surprise running into you!\"\n\n\"I know, it's been too long! How have you been?\" \n\n\n",
    "\"Mary!  Seriously, cut it out!\" \n\n\"Cut WHAT out?  I'm not doing anything!\"\n\n\"That incessant tapping! Your pen on the desk, it's driving me bonkers!\"\n\n\"Fine, fine! And hey, while we're on the topic of annoying habits...that coffee slurping has GOT to stop!\"\n\n\"I do NOT slurp my coffee! And anyway, you wouldn't even hear it if you weren't always yelling into that phone of yours!\" \n\n\n\n\n",
    "\"The weather in Beijing is absolutely glorious!\"\n\n\"Autumn is pure magic here,  the best time of year, wouldn't you say?\" \n\n\"You're not wrong! The summer swelter is gone, and winter's chill is still a distant thought. What's the weather like in Washington, D.C. this time of year?\" \n\n\"Autumn's quite lovely in D.C. too.\" \n\n\"Do you get hit with harsh winters there?\" \n",
    "\"Mike, come check out this shrimp painting! It's incredible how such simple brushstrokes create something so lifelike!\"\n\n\"Whoa, that IS impressive! Is this a Qi Baishi?\" \n\n\"You know your stuff!  How did you recognize it?\"\n\n\"Qi Baishi is a legend!  Plus, I'm a bit of a Chinese art enthusiast.\" \n\n\"That's awesome! Do you have a preference for freehand brushwork or the more meticulous Gongbi style?\" \n\n\"I'm drawn to the expressive freedom of freehand, especially those serene landscapes. They evoke a sense of peace and harmony, wouldn't you say?\"\n\n\"Absolutely. Chinese art often emphasizes the interconnectedness of humanity and nature, a key element of traditional Chinese culture.\" \n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "\"Ugh, this weather is brutal!\" \n\n\"Yeah, at least the snow stopped, but it's freezing out here!\" \n\n\"Check out those icicles hanging from the roof! Crazy!\"\n\n\"And forget about walking anywhere, the streets are a sheet of ice.\"\n\n\"How cold is it today, anyway? I missed the forecast.\"\n\n\"Feels like at least ten below, easy.  I don't mind the cold, but the ice is treacherous!\"\n\n\"Hey,  pretty soon we'll be able to ice skate! Winter sports, here we come!\" \n\n\n",
    "\"Thanks for seeing me off, Nick!\"\n\n\"Of course!  Glad you had a good trip.  I'm going to miss you.\"\n\n\"Me too!  I'll write you when I get to Boston and give you a call soon.\"\n\n\"Perfect!  Looks like they're starting to board.\" \n\n\n",
    "\"What are your work hours?\" \n\n\"Eight to twelve,  then back at it from two to six.  A nice, predictable schedule.\" \n\n\"Lucky you!  My hours are a total crapshoot.  Day shift, night shift...it's like a roulette wheel of sleep deprivation.\" \n\n\n\n\n",
    "The interviewer leaned forward, her eyes scanning the resume.  \"It says here you attended Yale, Mr. Smith.  What was your area of study?\"\n\n\"I received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Economics.\"\n\n\"Impressive!  And if you don't mind my asking, what is your current age?\"\n\n\"I am twenty-seven.\" \n\n\"Thank you.  And could you elaborate on your previous work experience?\"\n\n\"Certainly.  I have been employed at a banking institution for the past five years.\" \n\n\n",
    "\"This garden is stunning!  Those tulips are absolutely breathtaking!\" \n\n\"Honey, could you take a picture of me here? I want to get the garden in the background.\"\n\n\"Of course!  Move a little closer to the flowers... perfect! Big smile!  Say cheese!  Got it!  That's a great one.\" \n\n\"Thanks!  Think you could snap another one from over here?\"\n\n\"Sure thing!\" \n\n\"Okay, now let's take one together!\" \n\n\n"
