    "Abstract expressionism is a post–World War II art movement in American painting, developed in New York City in the 1940s. It was the first specifically American movement to achieve international influence and put New York at the center of the Western art world, a role formerly filled by Paris.",
    "Although the term \"abstract expressionism\" was first applied to American art in 1946 by the art critic Robert Coates, it had been first used in Germany in 1919 in the magazine Der Sturm, regarding German Expressionism",
    "In the United States, Alfred Barr was the first to use this term in 1929 in relation to works by Wassily Kandinsky.",
    "Cubism is an early-20th-century avant-garde art movement that revolutionized European painting and sculpture, and inspired related movements in music, literature and architecture",
    "In Cubist artwork, objects are analyzed, broken up and reassembled in an abstracted form—instead of depicting objects from a single viewpoint, the artist depicts the subject from a multitude of viewpoints to represent the subject in a greater context. Cubism has been considered the most influential art movement of the 20th century. The term is broadly used in association with a wide variety of art produced in Paris (Montmartre and Montparnasse) or near Paris (Puteaux) during the 1910s and throughout the 1920s.",
    "The movement was pioneered by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque, and joined by Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Robert Delaunay, Henri Le Fauconnier, Juan Gris, and Fernand Léger. One primary influence that led to Cubism was the representation of three-dimensional form in the late works of Paul Cézanne. A retrospective of Cézanne's paintings was held at the Salon d'Automne of 1904, current works were displayed at the 1905 and 1906 Salon d'Automne, followed by two commemorative retrospectives after his death in 1907.",
    "In France, offshoots of Cubism developed, including Orphism, abstract art and later Purism. The impact of Cubism was far-reaching and wide-ranging",
    "In France and other countries Futurism, Suprematism, Dada, Constructivism, Vorticism, De Stijl and Art Deco developed in response to Cubism",
    "Early Futurist paintings hold in common with Cubism the fusing of the past and the present, the representation of different views of the subject pictured at the same time or successively, also called multiple perspective, simultaneity or multiplicity, while Constructivism was influenced by Picasso's technique of constructing sculpture from separate elements. Other common threads between these disparate movements include the faceting or simplification of geometric forms, and the association of mechanization and modern life.",
    "Surrealism is a cultural movement that developed in Europe in the aftermath of World War I in which artists depicted unnerving, illogical scenes and developed techniques to allow the unconscious mind to express itself. Its aim was, according to leader André Breton, to \"resolve the previously contradictory conditions of dream and reality into an absolute reality, a super-reality\", or surreality. It produced works of painting, writing, theatre, filmmaking, photography, and other media.",
    "Works of Surrealism feature the element of surprise, unexpected juxtapositions and non sequitur",
    "However, many Surrealist artists and writers regard their work as an expression of the philosophical movement first and foremost (for instance, of the \"pure psychic automatism\" Breton speaks of in the first Surrealist Manifesto), with the works themselves being secondary, i.e",
    "artifacts of surrealist experimentation. Leader Breton was explicit in his assertion that Surrealism was, above all, a revolutionary movement",
    "At the time, the movement was associated with political causes such as communism and anarchism",
    "It was influenced by the Dada movement of the 1910s.",
    "The term \"Surrealism\" originated with Guillaume Apollinaire in 1917. However, the Surrealist movement was not officially established until after October 1924, when the Surrealist Manifesto published by French poet and critic André Breton succeeded in claiming the term for his group over a rival faction led by Yvan Goll, who had published his own surrealist manifesto two weeks prior. The most important center of the movement was Paris, France",
    "From the 1920s onward, the movement spread around the globe, impacting the visual arts, literature, film, and music of many countries and languages, as well as political thought and practice, philosophy, and social theory.",
    "Renaissance art (1350 - 1620 AD) is the painting, sculpture, and decorative arts of the period of European history known as the Renaissance, which emerged as a distinct style in Italy in about AD 1400, in parallel with developments which occurred in philosophy, literature, music, science, and technology",
    "Renaissance art took as its foundation the art of Classical antiquity, perceived as the noblest of ancient traditions, but transformed that tradition by absorbing recent developments in the art of Northern Europe and by applying contemporary scientific knowledge",
    "Along with Renaissance humanist philosophy, it spread throughout Europe, affecting both artists and their patrons with the development of new techniques and new artistic sensibilities",
    "For art historians, Renaissance art marks the transition of Europe from the medieval period to the Early Modern age.",
    "The body of art, painting, sculpture, architecture, music and literature identified as \"Renaissance art\" was primarily produced during the 14th, 15th, and 16th centuries in Europe under the combined influences of an increased awareness of nature, a revival of classical learning, and a more individualistic view of man",
    "Scholars no longer believe that the Renaissance marked an abrupt break with medieval values, as is suggested by the French word renaissance, literally meaning \"rebirth\"",
    "In many parts of Europe, Early Renaissance art was created in parallel with Late Medieval art.",
    "The Baroque (UK: /bəˈrɒk/, US: /bəˈroʊk/; French: [baʁɔk]) is a style of architecture, music, dance, painting, sculpture, poetry, and other arts that flourished in Europe from the early 17th century until the 1750s. In the territories of the Spanish and Portuguese empires including the Iberian Peninsula it continued, together with new styles, until the first decade of the 19th century",
    "It followed Renaissance art and Mannerism and preceded the Rococo (in the past often referred to as \"late Baroque\") and Neoclassical styles",
    "It was encouraged by the Catholic Church as a means to counter the simplicity and austerity of Protestant architecture, art, and music, though Lutheran Baroque art developed in parts of Europe as well.",
    "The Baroque style used contrast, movement, exuberant detail, deep colour, grandeur, and surprise to achieve a sense of awe",
    "The style began at the start of the 17th century in Rome, then spread rapidly to France, northern Italy, Spain, and Portugal, then to Austria, southern Germany, and Russia",
    "By the 1730s, it had evolved into an even more flamboyant style, called rocaille or Rococo, which appeared in France and Central Europe until the mid to late 18th century.",
    "In the decorative arts, the style employs plentiful and intricate ornamentation",
    "The departure from Renaissance classicism has its own ways in each country",
    "But a general feature is that everywhere the starting point is the ornamental elements introduced by the Renaissance",
    "The classical repertoire is crowded, dense, overlapping, loaded, in order to provoke shock effects",
    "New motifs introduced by Baroque are: the cartouche, trophies and weapons, baskets of fruit or flowers, and others, made in marquetry, stucco, or carved.",
    "Dada (/ˈdɑːdɑː/) or Dadaism was an art movement of the European avant-garde in the early 20th century, with early centres in Zürich, Switzerland, at the Cabaret Voltaire (in 1916)",
    "Developed in reaction to World War I, the Dada movement consisted of artists who rejected the logic, reason, and aestheticism of modern capitalist society, instead expressing nonsense, irrationality, and anti-bourgeois protest in their works. The art of the movement spanned visual, literary, and sound media, including collage, sound poetry, cut-up writing, and sculpture",
    "Dadaist artists expressed their discontent toward violence, war, and nationalism, and maintained political affinities with radical left-wing and far-left politics.",
    "There is no consensus on the origin of the movement's name; a common story is that the German artist Richard Huelsenbeck slid a paper knife (letter-opener) at random into a dictionary, where it landed on \"dada\", a colloquial French term for a hobby horse",
    "Jean Arp wrote that Tristan Tzara invented the word at 6 p.m",
    "on 6 February 1916, in the Café de la Terrasse in Zürich. Others note that it suggests the first words of a child, evoking a childishness and absurdity that appealed to the group",
    "Still others speculate that the word might have been chosen to evoke a similar meaning (or no meaning at all) in any language, reflecting the movement's internationalism.",
    "The term anti-art, a precursor to Dada, was coined by Marcel Duchamp around 1913 to characterize works that challenge accepted definitions of art. Cubism and the development of collage and abstract art would inform the movement's detachment from the constraints of reality and convention",
    "The work of French poets, Italian Futurists and the German Expressionists would influence Dada's rejection of the tight correlation between words and meaning. Works such as Ubu Roi (1896) by Alfred Jarry and the ballet Parade (1916–17) by Erik Satie would also be characterized as proto-Dadaist works. The Dada movement's principles were first collected in Hugo Ball's Dada Manifesto in 1916.",
    "The Dadaist movement included public gatherings, demonstrations, and publication of art/literary journals; passionate coverage of art, politics, and culture were topics often discussed in a variety of media",
    "Key figures in the movement included Jean Arp, Johannes Baader, Hugo Ball, Marcel Duchamp, Max Ernst, Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven, George Grosz, Raoul Hausmann, John Heartfield, Emmy Hennings, Hannah Höch, Richard Huelsenbeck, Francis Picabia, Man Ray, Hans Richter, Kurt Schwitters, Sophie Taeuber-Arp, Tristan Tzara, and Beatrice Wood, among others",
    "The movement influenced later styles like the avant-garde and downtown music movements, and groups including Surrealism, nouveau réalisme, pop art and Fluxus.",
    "Fauvism /ˈfoʊvɪzm̩/ is the style of les Fauves (French for \"the wild beasts\"), a group of early 20th-century modern artists whose works emphasized painterly qualities and strong colour over the representational or realistic values retained by Impressionism",
    "While Fauvism as a style began around 1904 and continued beyond 1910, the movement as such lasted only a few years, 1905–1908, and had three exhibitions. The leaders of the movement were André Derain, Maurice de Vlaminck, and Henri Matisse.",
    "Pop art is an art movement that emerged in the United Kingdom and the United States during the mid- to late-1950s. The movement presented a challenge to traditions of fine art by including imagery from popular and mass culture, such as advertising, comic books and mundane mass-produced objects",
    "One of its aims is to use images of popular culture in art, emphasizing the banal or kitschy elements of any culture, most often through the use of irony. It is also associated with the artists' use of mechanical means of reproduction or rendering techniques",
    "In pop art, material is sometimes visually removed from its known context, isolated, or combined with unrelated material.",
    "Amongst the early artists that shaped the pop art movement were Eduardo Paolozzi and Richard Hamilton in Britain, and Larry Rivers, Ray Johnson",
    "Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns among others in the United States",
    "Pop art is widely interpreted as a reaction to the then-dominant ideas of abstract expressionism, as well as an expansion of those ideas. Due to its utilization of found objects and images, it is similar to Dada",
    "Pop art and minimalism are considered to be art movements that precede postmodern art, or are some of the earliest examples of postmodern art themselves.",
    "Pop art often takes imagery that is currently in use in advertising",
    "Product labeling and logos figure prominently in the imagery chosen by pop artists, seen in the labels of Campbell's Soup Cans, by Andy Warhol",
    "Even the labeling on the outside of a shipping box containing food items for retail has been used as subject matter in pop art, as demonstrated by Warhol's Campbell's Tomato Juice Box, 1964 (pictured).",
    "Neo-Impressionism is a term coined by French art critic Félix Fénéon in 1886 to describe an art movement founded by Georges Seurat",
    "Seurat's most renowned masterpiece, A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte, marked the beginning of this movement when it first made its appearance at an exhibition of the Société des Artistes Indépendants (Salon des Indépendants) in Paris. Around this time, the peak of France's modern era emerged and many painters were in search of new methods",
    "Followers of Neo-Impressionism, in particular, were drawn to modern urban scenes as well as landscapes and seashores",
    "Science-based interpretation of lines and colors influenced Neo-Impressionists' characterization of their own contemporary art. The Pointillist and Divisionist techniques are often mentioned in this context, because they were the dominant techniques in the beginning of the Neo-impressionist movement.",
    "Some argue that Neo-Impressionism became the first true avant-garde movement in painting. The Neo-Impressionists were able to create a movement very quickly in the 19th century, partially due to its strong connection to anarchism, which set a pace for later artistic manifestations. The movement and the style were an attempt to drive \"harmonious\" vision from modern science, anarchist theory, and late 19th-century debate around the value of academic art",
    "The artists of the movement \"promised to employ optical and psycho-biological theories in pursuit of a grand synthesis of the ideal and the real, the fugitive and the essential, science and temperament.\"",
    "Futurism (Italian: Futurismo) was an artistic and social movement that originated in Italy, and to a lesser extent in other countries, in the early 20th century",
    "It emphasized dynamism, speed, technology, youth, violence, and objects such as the car, the airplane, and the industrial city",
    "Its key figures included the Italians Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, Umberto Boccioni, Carlo Carrà, Fortunato Depero, Gino Severini, Giacomo Balla, and Luigi Russolo",
    "Italian Futurism glorified modernity and according to its doctrine, aimed to liberate Italy from the weight of its past.[page needed] Important Futurist works included Marinetti's 1909 Manifesto of Futurism, Boccioni's 1913 sculpture Unique Forms of Continuity in Space, Balla's 1913–1914 painting Abstract Speed + Sound, and Russolo's The Art of Noises (1913).",
    "Although Futurism was largely an Italian phenomenon, parallel movements emerged in Russia, where some Russian Futurists would later go on to found groups of their own; other countries either had a few Futurists or had movements inspired by Futurism",
    "The Futurists practiced in every medium of art, including painting, sculpture, ceramics, graphic design, industrial design, interior design, urban design, theatre, film, fashion, textiles, literature, music, architecture, and even  cooking.",
    "To some extent Futurism influenced the art movements Art Deco, Constructivism, Surrealism, and Dada, and to a greater degree Precisionism, Rayonism, and Vorticism",
    "Passéism [fr] can represent an opposing trend or attitude.",
    "Art Nouveau (/ˌɑːrt nuːˈvoʊ, ˌɑːr/; French: [aʁ nuvo]) is an international style of art, architecture, and applied art, especially the decorative arts",
    "The style is known by different names in different languages: Jugendstil in German, Stile Liberty in Italian, Modernisme in Catalan, and also known as the Modern Style in English",
    "It was popular between 1890 and 1910 during the Belle Époque period, and was a reaction against the academic art, eclecticism and historicism of 19th century architecture and decoration",
    "It was often inspired by natural forms such as the sinuous curves of plants and flowers. Other characteristics of Art Nouveau were a sense of dynamism and movement, often given by asymmetry or whiplash lines, and the use of modern materials, particularly iron, glass, ceramics and later concrete, to create unusual forms and larger open spaces.",
    "One major objective of Art Nouveau was to break down the traditional distinction between fine arts (especially painting and sculpture) and applied arts",
    "It was most widely used in interior design, graphic arts, furniture, glass art, textiles, ceramics, jewellery and metal work",
    "The style responded to leading 19-century theoreticians, such as French architect Eugène-Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc (1814–1879) and British art critic John Ruskin (1819–1900)",
    "In Britain, it was influenced by William Morris and the Arts and Crafts movement",
    "German architects and designers sought a spiritually uplifting Gesamtkunstwerk (\"total work of art\") that would unify the architecture, furnishings, and art in the interior in a common style, to uplift and inspire the residents.",
    "The first Art Nouveau houses and interior decoration appeared in Brussels in the 1890s, in the architecture and interior design of houses designed by Paul Hankar, Henry van de Velde, and especially Victor Horta, whose Hôtel Tassel was completed in 1893. It moved quickly to Paris, where it was adapted by Hector Guimard, who saw Horta's work in Brussels and applied the style for the entrances of the new Paris Métro",
    "It reached its peak at the 1900 Paris International Exposition, which introduced the Art Nouveau work of artists such as Louis Tiffany",
    "It appeared in graphic arts in the posters of Alphonse Mucha, and the glassware of René Lalique and Émile Gallé.",
    "From Belgium and France, Art Nouveau spread to the rest of Europe, taking on different names and characteristics in each country (see Naming section below)",
    "It often appeared not only in capitals, but also in rapidly growing cities that wanted to establish artistic identities (Turin and Palermo in Italy; Glasgow in Scotland; Munich and Darmstadt in Germany), as well as in centres of independence movements (Helsinki in Finland, then part of the Russian Empire; Barcelona in Catalonia, Spain).",
    "By 1914, and with the beginning of the First World War, Art Nouveau was largely exhausted",
    "In the 1920s, it was replaced as the dominant architectural and decorative art style by Art Deco and then Modernism. The Art Nouveau style began to receive more positive attention from critics in the late 1960s, with a major exhibition of the work of Hector Guimard at the Museum of Modern Art in 1970.",
    "Romanticism (also known as the Romantic movement or Romantic era) was an artistic, literary, musical, and intellectual movement that originated in Europe towards the end of the 18th century, and in most areas was at its peak in the approximate period from 1800 to 1850",
    "Romanticism was characterized by its emphasis on emotion and individualism, clandestine literature, idealization of nature, suspicion of science and industrialization, and glorification of the past with a strong preference for the medieval rather than the classical.   It was partly a reaction to the Industrial Revolution, the social and political norms of the Age of Enlightenment, and the scientific rationalization of nature. It was embodied most strongly in the visual arts, music, and literature, but had a major impact on historiography, education, chess, social sciences, and the natural sciences.  It had a significant and complex effect on politics, with romantic thinkers influencing conservatism, liberalism, radicalism, and nationalism.",
    "The movement emphasized intense emotion as an authentic source of aesthetic experience, placing new emphasis on such emotions as fear, horror, terror and awe — especially that experienced in confronting the new aesthetic categories of the sublime and beauty of nature. It elevated folk art and ancient custom to something noble, but also spontaneity as a desirable characteristic (as in the musical impromptu)",
    "In contrast to the rationalism and classicism of the Enlightenment, Romanticism revived medievalism and elements of art and narrative perceived as authentically medieval in an attempt to escape population growth, early urban sprawl, and industrialism.",
    "Although the movement was rooted in the German Sturm und Drang movement, which preferred intuition and emotion to the rationalism of the Enlightenment, the events and ideologies of the French Revolution were also proximate factors since many of the early Romantics were cultural revolutionaries and sympathetic to the revolution. Romanticism assigned a high value to the achievements of \"heroic\" individualists and artists, whose examples, it maintained, would raise the quality of society",
    "It also promoted the individual imagination as a critical authority allowed of freedom from classical notions of form in art",
    "There was a strong recourse to historical and natural inevitability, a Zeitgeist, in the representation of its ideas",
    "In the second half of the 19th century, Realism was offered as a polar opposite to Romanticism. The decline of Romanticism during this time was associated with multiple processes, including social and political changes.",
    "Minimalism describes movements in various forms of art and design, especially visual art and music, where the work is set out to expose the essence, essentials or identity of a subject through eliminating all non-essential forms, features or concepts",
    "As a specific movement in the arts it is identified with developments in post–World War II Western Art, most strongly with American visual arts in the 1960s and early 1970s",
    "Prominent artists associated with this movement include Ad Reinhardt, Nassos Daphnis, Tony Smith, Donald Judd, John McCracken, Agnes Martin, Dan Flavin, Robert Morris, Larry Bell, Anne Truitt, Yves Klein and Frank Stella",
    "Artists themselves have sometimes reacted against the label due to the negative implication of the work being simplistic. Minimalism is often interpreted as a reaction to abstract expressionism and a bridge to postminimal art practices.",
    "Impressionism was a 19th-century art movement characterized by relatively small, thin, yet visible brush strokes, open composition, emphasis on accurate depiction of light in its changing qualities (often accentuating the effects of the passage of time), ordinary subject matter, unusual visual angles, and inclusion of movement as a crucial element of human perception and experience",
    "Impressionism originated with a group of Paris-based artists whose independent exhibitions brought them to prominence during the 1870s and 1880s.",
    "The Impressionists faced harsh opposition from the conventional art community in France",
    "The name of the style derives from the title of a Claude Monet work, Impression, soleil levant (Impression, Sunrise), which provoked the critic Louis Leroy to coin the term in a satirical review published in the Parisian newspaper Le Charivari",
    "The development of Impressionism in the visual arts was soon followed by analogous styles in other media that became known as impressionist music and impressionist literature.",
    "Post-Impressionism (also spelled Postimpressionism) was a predominantly French art movement that developed roughly between 1886 and 1905, from the last Impressionist exhibition to the birth of Fauvism",
    "Post-Impressionism emerged as a reaction against Impressionists' concern for the naturalistic depiction of light and colour",
    "Its broad emphasis on abstract qualities or symbolic content means Post-Impressionism encompasses Les Nabis, Neo-Impressionism, Symbolism, Cloisonnism, the Pont-Aven School, and Synthetism, along with some later Impressionists' work",
    "The movement's principal artists were Paul Cézanne (known as the father of Post-Impressionism), Paul Gauguin, Vincent van Gogh and Georges Seurat.",
    "The term Post-Impressionism was first used by art critic Roger Fry in 1906. Critic Frank Rutter in a review of the Salon d'Automne published in Art News, 15 October 1910, described Othon Friesz as a \"post-impressionist leader\"; there was also an advert for the show The Post-Impressionists of France. Three weeks later, Roger Fry used the term again when he organised the 1910 exhibition Manet and the Post-Impressionists, defining it as the development of French art since Manet.",
    "Post-Impressionists extended Impressionism while rejecting its limitations: they continued using vivid colours, sometimes using impasto (thick application of paint) and painting from life, but were more inclined to emphasize geometric forms, distort form for expressive effect, and use unnatural or modified colour.",
    "Conceptual art, also referred to as conceptualism, is art in which the concept(s) or idea(s) involved in the work take precedence over traditional aesthetic, technical, and material concerns",
    "Some works of conceptual art, sometimes called installations, may be constructed by anyone simply by following a set of written instructions. This method was fundamental to American artist Sol LeWitt's definition of conceptual art, one of the first to appear in print:",
    "Tony Godfrey, author of Conceptual Art (Art & Ideas) (1998), asserts that conceptual art questions the nature of art, a notion that Joseph Kosuth elevated to a definition of art itself in his seminal, early manifesto of conceptual art, Art after Philosophy (1969)",
    "The notion that art should examine its own nature was already a potent aspect of the influential art critic Clement Greenberg's vision of Modern art during the 1950s",
    "With the emergence of an exclusively language-based art in the 1960s, however, conceptual artists such as Art & Language, Joseph Kosuth (who became the American editor of Art-Language), and Lawrence Weiner began a far more radical interrogation of art than was previously possible (see below)",
    "One of the first and most important things they questioned was the common assumption that the role of the artist was to create special kinds of material objects.",
    "Through its association with the Young British Artists and the Turner Prize during the 1990s, in popular usage, particularly in the United Kingdom, \"conceptual art\" came to denote all contemporary art that does not practice the traditional skills of painting and sculpture. One of the reasons why the term \"conceptual art\" has come to be associated with various contemporary practices far removed from its original aims and forms lies in the problem of defining the term itself",
    "As the artist Mel Bochner suggested as early as 1970, in explaining why he does not like the epithet \"conceptual\", it is not always entirely clear what \"concept\" refers to, and it runs the risk of being confused with \"intention\"",
    "Thus, in describing or defining a work of art as conceptual it is important not to confuse what is referred to as \"conceptual\" with an artist's \"intention\".",
    "Gothic art was a style of medieval art that developed in Northern France out of Romanesque art in the 12th century AD, led by the concurrent development of Gothic architecture",
    "It spread to all of Western Europe, and much of Northern, Southern and Central Europe, never quite effacing more classical styles in Italy",
    "In the late 14th century, the sophisticated court style of International Gothic developed, which continued to evolve until the late 15th century",
    "In many areas, especially Germany, Late Gothic art continued well into the 16th century, before being subsumed into Renaissance art",
    "Primary media in the Gothic period included sculpture, panel painting, stained glass, fresco and illuminated manuscripts",
    "The easily recognizable shifts in architecture from Romanesque to Gothic, and Gothic to Renaissance styles, are typically used to define the periods in art in all media, although in many ways figurative art developed at a different pace.",
    "The earliest Gothic art was monumental sculpture, on the walls of Cathedrals and abbeys",
    "Christian art was often typological in nature (see Medieval allegory), showing the stories of the New Testament and the Old Testament side by side",
    "Images of the Virgin Mary changed from the Byzantine iconic form to a more human and affectionate mother, cuddling her infant, swaying from her hip, and showing the refined manners of a well-born aristocratic courtly lady.",
    "Secular art came into its own during this period with the rise of cities, foundation of universities, increase in trade, the establishment of a money-based economy and the creation of a bourgeois class who could afford to patronize the arts and commission works, resulting in a proliferation of paintings and illuminated manuscripts",
    "Increased literacy and a growing body of secular vernacular literature encouraged the representation of secular themes in art",
    "With the growth of cities, trade guilds were formed and artists were often required to be members of a painters' guild",
    "As a result, because of better record keeping, more artists are known to us by name in this period than any previous; some artists were even so bold as to sign their names.",
    "Rococo (/rəˈkoʊkoʊ/, also US: /ˌroʊkəˈkoʊ/), less commonly Roccoco or Late Baroque, is an exceptionally ornamental and theatrical style of architecture, art and decoration which combines asymmetry, scrolling curves, gilding, white and pastel colours, sculpted moulding, and trompe-l'œil frescoes to create surprise and the illusion of motion and drama",
    "It is often described as the final expression of the Baroque movement.",
    "The Rococo style began in France in the 1730s as a reaction against the more formal and geometric Louis XIV style",
    "It was known as the \"style Rocaille\", or \"Rocaille style\". It soon spread to other parts of Europe, particularly northern Italy, Austria, southern Germany, Central Europe and Russia. It also came to influence the other arts, particularly sculpture, furniture, silverware, glassware, painting, music, and theatre. Although originally a secular style primarily used for interiors of private residences, the Rococo had a spiritual aspect to it which led to its widespread use in church interiors, particularly in Central Europe, Portugal, and South America.",
    "Realism in the arts is generally the attempt to represent subject matter truthfully, without artificiality and avoiding speculative fiction and supernatural elements",
    "The term is often used interchangeably with naturalism, even though these terms are not synonymous",
    "Naturalism, as an idea relating to visual representation in Western art, seeks to depict objects with the least possible amount of distortion and is tied to the development of linear perspective and illusionism in Renaissance Europe. Realism, while predicated upon naturalistic representation and a departure from the idealization of earlier academic art, refers to a specific art historical movement that originated in France in the aftermath of the French Revolution of 1848",
    "With artists like Gustave Courbet capitalizing on the mundane, ugly or sordid, realism was motivated by the renewed interest in the common man and the rise of leftist politics. The Realist painters rejected Romanticism, which had come to dominate French literature and art, with roots in the late 18th century.",
    "In 19th-century Europe, \"Naturalism\" or the \"Naturalist school\" was somewhat artificially erected as a term representing a breakaway sub-movement of realism, that attempted (not wholly successfully) to distinguish itself from its parent by its avoidance of politics and social issues, and liked to proclaim a quasi-scientific basis, playing on the sense of \"naturalist\" as a student of natural history, as the biological sciences were then generally known.",
    "There have been various movements invoking realism in the other arts, such as the opera style of verismo, literary realism, theatrical realism, and Italian neorealist cinema.",
    "Art Deco, short for the French Arts Décoratifs, and sometimes just called Deco, is a style of visual arts, architecture, and product design, that first appeared in France in the 1910s (just before World War I), and flourished in the United States and Europe during the 1920s and 1930s",
    "Through styling and design of the exterior and interior of anything from large structures to small objects, including how people look (clothing, fashion and jewelry), Art Deco has influenced bridges, buildings (from skyscrapers to cinemas), ships, ocean liners, trains, cars, trucks, buses, furniture, and everyday objects like radios and vacuum cleaners.",
    "It got its name after the 1925 Exposition internationale des arts décoratifs et industriels modernes (International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts) held in Paris.",
    "Art Deco combined modern styles with fine craftsmanship and rich materials",
    "During its heyday, it represented luxury, glamour, exuberance, and faith in social and technological progress.",
    "From its outset, Art Deco was influenced by the bold geometric forms of Cubism and the Vienna Secession; the bright colours of Fauvism and of the Ballets Russes; the updated craftsmanship of the furniture of the eras of Louis Philippe I and Louis XVI; and the exoticized styles of China, Japan, India, Persia, ancient Egypt and Maya art",
    "It featured rare and expensive materials, such as ebony and ivory, and exquisite craftsmanship",
    "The Empire State Building, Chrysler Building, and other skyscrapers of New York City built during the 1920s and 1930s are monuments to the style.",
    "In the 1930s, during the Great Depression, Art Deco became more subdued",
    "New materials arrived, including chrome plating, stainless steel and plastic",
    "A sleeker form of the style, called Streamline Moderne, appeared in the 1930s, featuring curving forms and smooth, polished surfaces. Art Deco is one of the first truly international styles, but its dominance ended with the beginning of World War II and the rise of the strictly functional and unadorned styles of modern architecture and the International Style of architecture that followed.",

    "It is characterized by intense subjectivity and rough handling of materials.",
    "Neo-expressionism developed as a reaction against conceptual art and minimal art of the 1970s",
    "Neo-expressionists returned to portraying recognizable objects, such as the human body (although sometimes in an abstract manner), in a rough and violently emotional way, often using vivid colors. It was overtly inspired by German Expressionist painters, such as Emil Nolde, Max Beckmann, George Grosz, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, James Ensor and Edvard Munch",
    "It is also related to American Lyrical Abstraction painting of the 1960s and 1970s, The Hairy Who movement in Chicago, the Bay Area Figurative School of the 1950s and 1960s, the continuation of Abstract Expressionism, precedents in Pop Painting, and New Image Painting: a vague late 1970s term applied to painters who employed a strident figurative style with cartoon-like imagery and abrasive handling owing something to Neo-Expressionism",

    "Postmodernism is an intellectual stance or mode of discourse characterized by skepticism toward the \"grand narratives\" of modernism, opposition to epistemic certainty or stability of meaning, and emphasis on ideology as a means of maintaining political power. Claims to objective fact are dismissed as naïve realism, with attention drawn to the conditional nature of knowledge claims within particular historical, political, and cultural discourses. The postmodern outlook is characterized by self-referentiality, epistemological relativism, moral relativism, pluralism, irony, irreverence, and eclecticism; it rejects the \"universal validity\" of binary oppositions, stable identity, hierarchy, and categorization.",
    "Initially emerging from a mode of literary criticism, postmodernism developed in the mid-twentieth century as a rejection of modernism and has been observed across many disciplines. Postmodernism is associated with the disciplines deconstruction and post-structuralism. Various authors have criticized postmodernism as promoting obscurantism, as abandoning Enlightenment rationalism and scientific rigor, and as adding nothing to analytical or empirical knowledge.",
    "Kinetic art is art from any medium that contains movement perceivable by the viewer or that depends on motion for its effect",
    "Canvas paintings that extend the viewer's perspective of the artwork and incorporate multidimensional movement are the earliest examples of kinetic art. More pertinently speaking, kinetic art is a term that today most often refers to three-dimensional sculptures and figures such as mobiles that move naturally or are machine operated (see e",

    "This term also clashes frequently with the term \"apparent movement\", which many people use when referring to an artwork whose movement is created by motors, machines, or electrically powered systems",
    "Both apparent and virtual movement are styles of kinetic art that only recently have been argued as styles of op art. The amount of overlap between kinetic and op art is not significant enough for artists and art historians to consider merging the two styles under one umbrella term, but there are distinctions that have yet to be made.",
    "\"Kinetic art\" as a moniker developed from a number of sources",
    "Kinetic art has its origins in the late 19th century impressionist artists such as Claude Monet, Edgar Degas, and Édouard Manet who originally experimented with accentuating the movement of human figures on canvas",
    "This triumvirate of impressionist painters all sought to create art that was more lifelike than their contemporaries",
    "Degas’ dancer and racehorse portraits are examples of what he believed to be \"photographic realism\";. During the late 19th century artists such as Degas felt the need to challenge the movement toward photography with vivid, cadenced landscapes and portraits.",
    "By the early 1900s, certain artists grew closer and closer to ascribing their art to dynamic motion",
    "Naum Gabo, one of the two artists attributed to naming this style, wrote frequently about his work as examples of \"kinetic rhythm\". He felt that his moving sculpture Kinetic Construction (also dubbed Standing Wave, 1919–20) was the first of its kind in the 20th century",
    "From the 1920s until the 1960s, the style of kinetic art was reshaped by a number of other artists who experimented with mobiles and new forms of sculpture.",
    "Constructivism is an early twentieth-century art movement founded in 1915 by Vladimir Tatlin and Alexander Rodchenko. Abstract and austere, constructivist art aimed to reflect modern industrial society and urban space. The movement rejected decorative stylization in  favor of the industrial assemblage of materials. Constructivists were in favour of art for propaganda and social purposes, and were associated with Soviet socialism, the Bolsheviks and the Russian avant-garde.",

    "Cubist artwork bursts with energy as objects are dissected, shattered, and pieced back together in a dynamic, abstract form! Rather than showcasing subjects from one flat angle, artists capture them from multiple viewpoints to reveal the bigger picture. Cubism is hailed as the powerhouse art movement of the 20th century, embodying innovation and creativity. It's a term intertwined with a diverse array of mesmerizing art created in the vibrant hubs of Paris (Montmartre and Montparnasse) and beyond (Puteaux) throughout the exhilarating 1910s and into the roaring 1920s!",
    "Cubism was founded by artists Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque, with contributions from Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Robert Delaunay, Henri Le Fauconnier, Juan Gris, and Fernand Léger. The movement was influenced by Paul Cézanne's late works that explored representing three-dimensional forms. Cézanne's paintings were featured at the Salon d'Automne exhibitions from 1904 to 1906, with additional retrospectives after his death in 1907.",

    "Futurism, Suprematism, Dada, Constructivism, Vorticism, De Stijl, and Art Deco emerged in France and other countries as different artistic movements in reaction to Cubism.",
    "Both Early Futurist paintings and Cubism embrace a fusion of the past and present, capturing various perspectives of the subject simultaneously or successively – a technique known as multiple perspective, simultaneity, or multiplicity. Constructivism, on the other hand, drew inspiration from Picasso's method of constructing sculptures from distinct elements. These movements share common traits such as the faceting and simplification of geometric forms, as well as an exploration of mechanization and modern existence.",

    "The term \"anti-art,\" a precursor to Dada, was coined by Marcel Duchamp around 1913 to describe works that challenge accepted definitions of art. Cubism, along with the development of collage and abstract art, influenced the movement's detachment from the constraints of reality and convention.",
    "French poets, Italian Futurists, and German Expressionists played a significant role in shaping Dada's stance against the strict connection of words to their meaning. Notable works like Ubu Roi (1896) by Alfred Jarry and the ballet Parade (1916–17) by Erik Satie are often considered as early influences on Dadaism. The foundational principles of the Dada movement were initially outlined in Hugo Ball's Dada Manifesto in 1916.",

    "Neo-Impressionist supporters, especially, were captivated by contemporary cityscapes, as well as scenic landscapes and seashores.",
    "Neo-Impressionists were influenced by science when interpreting lines and colors, which shaped their contemporary art. The Pointillist and Divisionist techniques, dominant at the start of the movement, are frequently cited in this regard.",
    "Neo-Impressionism is often considered the first true avant-garde movement in painting. Its swift emergence in the 19th century was facilitated by its close association with anarchism, paving the way for subsequent artistic developments. Rooted in modern science, anarchist ideology, and discussions on academic art's worth in the late 19th century, this movement sought to derive a \"harmonious\" visual expression.",

    "Art Nouveau architecture and interior design emerged in Brussels during the 1890s, showcased in the works of architects like Paul Hankar, Henry van de Velde, and Victor Horta. Horta's Hôtel Tassel, finished in 1893, was a particularly influential example. The style soon made its way to Paris, where it was embraced and adapted by Hector Guimard for the entrances of the new Paris Métro after he was inspired by Horta's designs in Brussels.",

It was a response to the Industrial Revolution, Enlightenment ideals, and the rise of science. Romanticism deeply influenced visual art, music, literature, as well as historiography, education, social sciences, and natural sciences. Furthermore, it left a nuanced mark on politics, inspiring a range of ideologies from conservatism to liberalism and nationalism.",
    "The movement focused on intense emotions as a genuine source of aesthetic experiences, highlighting feelings like fear, horror, terror, and awe. It particularly emphasized experiencing these emotions when encountering the new aesthetic concepts of the sublime and natural beauty. The movement celebrated folk art and ancient traditions as noble, while also valuing spontaneity as a desirable trait, such as seen in musical impromptus.",
    "Rationalism and classicism during the Enlightenment focused on logic and ancient ideas, while Romanticism looked back to medieval times for inspiration in art and storytelling. Romantics wanted to escape issues like overpopulation, expanding cities, and industrialization.",
    "Romanticism was influenced by the German Sturm und Drang movement, which eschewed the rationalism of the Enlightenment in favor of intuition and emotion. Additionally, the ideologies of the French Revolution played a significant role since many early Romantics were cultural revolutionaries sympathetic to the cause. Romanticism celebrated the accomplishments of \"heroic\" individualists and artists, believing that their examples would contribute to the improvement of society.",

Critic Frank Rutter referred to Othon Friesz as a \"post-impressionist leader\" in a review published in Art News on 15 October 1910, during the Salon d'Automne. Shortly after, an advertisement for the exhibition titled The Post-Impressionists of France was featured. Roger Fry then reused the term in 1910 when he curated the exhibition Manet and the Post-Impressionists, defining it as the progression of French art since Manet.",
    "Post-Impressionists built upon Impressionism by expanding its techniques while breaking free from its constraints. They maintained the use of vibrant colors, experimented with impasto (thick layers of paint), and depicted scenes from reality.

    "\"Emerging alongside the Young British Artists and the prestigious Turner Prize in the 1990s, 'conceptual art' has evolved into a broader term in the art world, especially in the vibrant scene of the United Kingdom. Today, it encompasses a range of innovative contemporary expressions that diverge from traditional painting and sculpture. The fluid nature of this term reflects the challenge of precisely defining 'conceptual art' amidst the diverse array of modern artistic practices.\"",
    "As early as 1970, artist Mel Bochner pointed out that he doesn't like the term \"conceptual\" because there can be confusion about what exactly a \"concept\" means. It may be mistaken for an \"intention.\"",
    "When talking about a work of art as conceptual, it's key to differentiate between \"conceptual\" and an artist's \"intention.\"",

    "The term is frequently utilized interchangeably with naturalism, although the two concepts are not identical.",
    "In Western art, naturalism is all about showing things as they really look with no crazy changes, thanks to stuff like linear perspective and illusionism during the Renaissance. Realism came right after that and is about showing things as they are, not all perfect and idealized like before, but more true to life. It all started in France after the revolution in 1848.",
    "Artists like Gustave Courbet were all about celebrating the everyday stuff, even the not-so-pretty parts. Realism became a thing because people were getting into the regular folks and leftist ideas were on the upswing. The Realist painters said \"no thanks\" to Romanticism, which had been running the show in French lit and art since way back in the 1700s.",

    "Postmodernism can be defined as an intellectual perspective or mode of discourse that exhibits skepticism towards the dominant narratives of modernism, questions the notion of epistemic certainty and fixed meanings, and highlights the role of ideology in upholding political authority. It rejects claims to absolute truth as simplistic realism, instead emphasizing the context-dependent and contingent nature of knowledge within various historical, political, and cultural contexts. Postmodern thought is characterized by self-referentiality, epistemological relativism, moral relativism, pluralism, irony, irreverence, and eclecticism. It challenges the notion of universal truths inherent in binary oppositions, fixed identities, hierarchical structures, and rigid categorizations.",

    "Recently, there's been a discussion around whether both apparent and virtual movement can be considered styles of op art. While there are similarities between kinetic and op art, they aren't quite similar enough to be grouped under the same category. However, there are still clear distinctions that need to be acknowledged.",
    "The term \"Kinetic art\" originated from various sources.",
    "Kinetic art traces its roots back to late 19th-century Impressionist artists like Claude Monet, Edgar Degas, and Édouard Manet, who boldly explored capturing the dynamic movement of human figures on canvas.",
    "These three impressionist painters aimed to create art that was more realistic than that of their peers.",
