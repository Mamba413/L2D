    "I rented I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW from my video store because of all the controversy that surrounded it when it was first released in 1967. I also heard that at first it was seized by U.S. customs if it ever tried to enter this country, therefore being a fan of films considered \"controversial\" I really had to see this for myself.<br /><br />The plot is centered around a young Swedish drama student named Lena who wants to learn everything she can about life. In particular she wants to focus her attentions to making some sort of documentary on what the average Swede thought about certain political issues such as the Vietnam War and race issues in the United States. In between asking politicians and ordinary denizens of Stockholm about their opinions on politics, she has sex with her drama teacher, classmates, and married men.<br /><br />What kills me about I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is that 40 years ago, this was considered pornographic. Really, the sex and nudity scenes are few and far between, even then it's not shot like some cheaply made porno. While my countrymen mind find it shocking, in reality sex and nudity are a major staple in Swedish cinema. Even Ingmar Bergman, arguably their answer to good old boy John Ford, had sex scenes in his films.<br /><br />I do commend the filmmakers for the fact that any sex shown in the film is shown for artistic purposes rather than just to shock people and make money to be shown in pornographic theaters in America. I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is a good film for anyone wanting to study the meat and potatoes (no pun intended) of Swedish cinema. But really, this film doesn't have much of a plot.",
    "\"I Am Curious: Yellow\" is a risible and pretentious steaming pile. It doesn't matter what one's political views are because this film can hardly be taken seriously on any level. As for the claim that frontal male nudity is an automatic NC-17, that isn't true. I've seen R-rated films with male nudity. Granted, they only offer some fleeting views, but where are the R-rated films with gaping vulvas and flapping labia? Nowhere, because they don't exist. The same goes for those crappy cable shows: schlongs swinging in the breeze but not a clitoris in sight. And those pretentious indie movies like The Brown Bunny, in which we're treated to the site of Vincent Gallo's throbbing johnson, but not a trace of pink visible on Chloe Sevigny. Before crying (or implying) \"double-standard\" in matters of nudity, the mentally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women: there are no genitals on display when actresses appears nude, and the same cannot be said for a man. In fact, you generally won't see female genitals in an American film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica. This alleged double-standard is less a double standard than an admittedly depressing ability to come to terms culturally with the insides of women's bodies.",
    "If only to avoid making this type of film in the future. This film is interesting as an experiment but tells no cogent story.<br /><br />One might feel virtuous for sitting thru it because it touches on so many IMPORTANT issues but it does so without any discernable motive. The viewer comes away with no new perspectives (unless one comes up with one while one's mind wanders, as it will invariably do during this pointless film).<br /><br />One might better spend one's time staring out a window at a tree growing.<br /><br />",
    "This film was probably inspired by Godard's Masculin, féminin and I urge you to see that film instead.<br /><br />The film has two strong elements and those are, (1) the realistic acting (2) the impressive, undeservedly good, photo. Apart from that, what strikes me most is the endless stream of silliness. Lena Nyman has to be most annoying actress in the world. She acts so stupid and with all the nudity in this film,...it's unattractive. Comparing to Godard's film, intellectuality has been replaced with stupidity. Without going too far on this subject, I would say that follows from the difference in ideals between the French and the Swedish society.<br /><br />A movie of its time, and place. 2/10.",
    "Oh, brother...after hearing about this ridiculous film for umpteen years all I can think of is that old Peggy Lee song..<br /><br />\"Is that all there is??\" ...I was just an early teen when this smoked fish hit the U.S. I was too young to get in the theater (although I did manage to sneak into \"Goodbye Columbus\"). Then a screening at a local film museum beckoned - Finally I could see this film, except now I was as old as my parents were when they schlepped to see it!!<br /><br />The ONLY reason this film was not condemned to the anonymous sands of time was because of the obscenity case sparked by its U.S. release. MILLIONS of people flocked to this stinker, thinking they were going to see a sex film...Instead, they got lots of closeups of gnarly, repulsive Swedes, on-street interviews in bland shopping malls, asinie political pretension...and feeble who-cares simulated sex scenes with saggy, pale actors.<br /><br />Cultural icon, holy grail, historic artifact..whatever this thing was, shred it, burn it, then stuff the ashes in a lead box!<br /><br />Elite esthetes still scrape to find value in its boring pseudo revolutionary political spewings..But if it weren't for the censorship scandal, it would have been ignored, then forgotten.<br /><br />Instead, the \"I Am Blank, Blank\" rhythymed title was repeated endlessly for years as a titilation for porno films (I am Curious, Lavender - for gay films, I Am Curious, Black - for blaxploitation films, etc..) and every ten years or so the thing rises from the dead, to be viewed by a new generation of suckers who want to see that \"naughty sex film\" that \"revolutionized the film industry\"...<br /><br />Yeesh, avoid like the plague..Or if you MUST see it - rent the video and fast forward to the \"dirty\" parts, just to get it over with.<br /><br />",
    "I would put this at the top of my list of films in the category of unwatchable trash! There are films that are bad, but the worst kind are the ones that are unwatchable but you are suppose to like them because they are supposed to be good for you! The sex sequences, so shocking in its day, couldn't even arouse a rabbit. The so called controversial politics is strictly high school sophomore amateur night Marxism. The film is self-consciously arty in the worst sense of the term. The photography is in a harsh grainy black and white. Some scenes are out of focus or taken from the wrong angle. Even the sound is bad! And some people call this art?<br /><br />",
    "Whoever wrote the screenplay for this movie obviously never consulted any books about Lucille Ball, especially her autobiography. I've never seen so many mistakes in a biopic, ranging from her early years in Celoron and Jamestown to her later years with Desi. I could write a whole list of factual errors, but it would go on for pages. In all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film. The filmmakers tried hard, but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me.",
    "When I first saw a glimpse of this movie, I quickly noticed the actress who was playing the role of Lucille Ball. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucy is absolutely awful. Lucille Ball was an astounding comedian with incredible talent. To think about a legend like Lucille Ball being portrayed the way she was in the movie is horrendous. I cannot believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a much better Lucy, the producers decided to get Rachel York. She might be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of Lucille Ball is tough. It is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble Lucille Ball, but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent. If you noticed York's portrayal of Lucy in episodes of I Love Lucy like the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin, nothing is similar in any way-her expression, voice, or movement.<br /><br />To top it all off, Danny Pino playing Desi Arnaz is horrible. Pino does not qualify to play as Ricky. He's small and skinny, his accent is unreal, and once again, his acting is unbelievable. Although Fred and Ethel were not similar either, they were not as bad as the characters of Lucy and Ricky.<br /><br />Overall, extremely horrible casting and the story is badly told. If people want to understand the real life situation of Lucille Ball, I suggest watching A&E Biography of Lucy and Desi, read the book from Lucille Ball herself, or PBS' American Masters: Finding Lucy. If you want to see a docudrama, \"Before the Laughter\" would be a better choice. The casting of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in \"Before the Laughter\" is much better compared to this. At least, a similar aspect is shown rather than nothing.",
    "Who are these \"They\"- the actors? the filmmakers? Certainly couldn't be the audience- this is among the most air-puffed productions in existence. It's the kind of movie that looks like it was a lot of fun to shoot TOO much fun, nobody is getting any actual work done, and that almost always makes for a movie that's no fun to watch.<br /><br />Ritter dons glasses so as to hammer home his character's status as a sort of doppleganger of the bespectacled Bogdanovich; the scenes with the breezy Ms. Stratten are sweet, but have an embarrassing, look-guys-I'm-dating-the-prom-queen feel to them. Ben Gazzara sports his usual cat's-got-canary grin in a futile attempt to elevate the meager plot, which requires him to pursue Audrey Hepburn with all the interest of a narcoleptic at an insomnia clinic. In the meantime, the budding couple's respective children (nepotism alert: Bogdanovich's daughters) spew cute and pick up some fairly disturbing pointers on 'love' while observing their parents. (Ms. Hepburn, drawing on her dignity, manages to rise above the proceedings- but she has the monumental challenge of playing herself, ostensibly.) Everybody looks great, but so what? It's a movie and we can expect that much, if that's what you're looking for you'd be better off picking up a copy of Vogue.<br /><br />Oh- and it has to be mentioned that Colleen Camp thoroughly annoys, even apart from her singing, which, while competent, is wholly unconvincing... the country and western numbers are woefully mismatched with the standards on the soundtrack. Surely this is NOT what Gershwin (who wrote the song from which the movie's title is derived) had in mind; his stage musicals of the 20's may have been slight, but at least they were long on charm. \"They All Laughed\" tries to coast on its good intentions, but nobody- least of all Peter Bogdanovich - has the good sense to put on the brakes.<br /><br />Due in no small part to the tragic death of Dorothy Stratten, this movie has a special place in the heart of Mr. Bogdanovich- he even bought it back from its producers, then distributed it on his own and went bankrupt when it didn't prove popular. His rise and fall is among the more sympathetic and tragic of Hollywood stories, so there's no joy in criticizing the film... there _is_ real emotional investment in Ms. Stratten's scenes. But \"Laughed\" is a faint echo of \"The Last Picture Show\", \"Paper Moon\" or \"What's Up, Doc\"- following \"Daisy Miller\" and \"At Long Last Love\", it was a thundering confirmation of the phase from which P.B. has never emerged.<br /><br />All in all, though, the movie is harmless, only a waste of rental. I want to watch people having a good time, I'll go to the park on a sunny day. For filmic expressions of joy and love, I'll stick to Ernest Lubitsch and Jaques Demy...",
    "This is said to be a personal film for Peter Bogdonavitch. He based it on his life but changed things around to fit the characters, who are detectives. These detectives date beautiful models and have no problem getting them. Sounds more like a millionaire playboy filmmaker than a detective, doesn't it? This entire movie was written by Peter, and it shows how out of touch with real people he was. You're supposed to write what you know, and he did that, indeed. And leaves the audience bored and confused, and jealous, for that matter. This is a curio for people who want to see Dorothy Stratten, who was murdered right after filming. But Patti Hanson, who would, in real life, marry Keith Richards, was also a model, like Stratten, but is a lot better and has a more ample part. In fact, Stratten's part seemed forced; added. She doesn't have a lot to do with the story, which is pretty convoluted to begin with. All in all, every character in this film is somebody that very few people can relate with, unless you're millionaire from Manhattan with beautiful supermodels at your beckon call. For the rest of us, it's an irritating snore fest. That's what happens when you're out of touch. You entertain your few friends with inside jokes, and bore all the rest.",
    "It was great to see some of my favorite stars of 30 years ago including John Ritter, Ben Gazarra and Audrey Hepburn. They looked quite wonderful. But that was it. They were not given any characters or good lines to work with. I neither understood or cared what the characters were doing.<br /><br />Some of the smaller female roles were fine, Patty Henson and Colleen Camp were quite competent and confident in their small sidekick parts. They showed some talent and it is sad they didn't go on to star in more and better films. Sadly, I didn't think Dorothy Stratten got a chance to act in this her only important film role.<br /><br />The film appears to have some fans, and I was very open-minded when I started watching it. I am a big Peter Bogdanovich fan and I enjoyed his last movie, \"Cat's Meow\" and all his early ones from \"Targets\" to \"Nickleodeon\". So, it really surprised me that I was barely able to keep awake watching this one.<br /><br />It is ironic that this movie is about a detective agency where the detectives and clients get romantically involved with each other. Five years later, Bogdanovich's ex-girlfriend, Cybil Shepherd had a hit television series called \"Moonlighting\" stealing the story idea from Bogdanovich. Of course, there was a great difference in that the series relied on tons of witty dialogue, while this tries to make do with slapstick and a few screwball lines.<br /><br />Bottom line: It ain't no \"Paper Moon\" and only a very pale version of \"What's Up, Doc\".",
    "I can't believe that those praising this movie herein aren't thinking of some other film. I was prepared for the possibility that this would be awful, but the script (or lack thereof) makes for a film that's also pointless. On the plus side, the general level of craft on the part of the actors and technical crew is quite competent, but when you've got a sow's ear to work with you can't make a silk purse. Ben G fans should stick with just about any other movie he's been in. Dorothy S fans should stick to Galaxina. Peter B fans should stick to Last Picture Show and Target. Fans of cheap laughs at the expense of those who seem to be asking for it should stick to Peter B's amazingly awful book, Killing of the Unicorn.",
    "Never cast models and Playboy bunnies in your films! Bob Fosse's \"Star 80\" about Dorothy Stratten, of whom Bogdanovich was obsessed enough to have married her SISTER after her murder at the hands of her low-life husband, is a zillion times more interesting than Dorothy herself on the silver screen. Patty Hansen is no actress either..I expected to see some sort of lost masterpiece a la Orson Welles but instead got Audrey Hepburn cavorting in jeans and a god-awful \"poodlesque\" hair-do....Very disappointing....\"Paper Moon\" and \"The Last Picture Show\" I could watch again and again. This clunker I could barely sit through once. This movie was reputedly not released because of the brouhaha surrounding Ms. Stratten's tawdry death; I think the real reason was because it was so bad!",
    "Its not the cast. A finer group of actors, you could not find. Its not the setting. The director is in love with New York City, and by the end of the film, so are we all! Woody Allen could not improve upon what Bogdonovich has done here. If you are going to fall in love, or find love, Manhattan is the place to go. No, the problem with the movie is the script. There is none. The actors fall in love at first sight, words are unnecessary. In the director's own experience in Hollywood that is what happens when they go to work on the set. It is reality to him, and his peers, but it is a fantasy to most of us in the real world. So, in the end, the movie is hollow, and shallow, and message-less.",
    "Today I found \"They All Laughed\" on VHS on sale in a rental. It was a really old and very used VHS, I had no information about this movie, but I liked the references listed on its cover: the names of Peter Bogdanovich, Audrey Hepburn, John Ritter and specially Dorothy Stratten attracted me, the price was very low and I decided to risk and buy it. I searched IMDb, and the User Rating of 6.0 was an excellent reference. I looked in \"Mick Martin & Marsha Porter Video & DVD Guide 2003\" and  wow  four stars! So, I decided that I could not waste more time and immediately see it. Indeed, I have just finished watching \"They All Laughed\" and I found it a very boring overrated movie. The characters are badly developed, and I spent lots of minutes to understand their roles in the story. The plot is supposed to be funny (private eyes who fall in love for the women they are chasing), but I have not laughed along the whole story. The coincidences, in a huge city like New York, are ridiculous. Ben Gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man, with the women falling for him as if her were a Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas or George Clooney, is quite ridiculous. In the end, the greater attractions certainly are the presence of the Playboy centerfold and playmate of the year Dorothy Stratten, murdered by her husband pretty after the release of this movie, and whose life was showed in \"Star 80\" and \"Death of a Centerfold: The Dorothy Stratten Story\"; the amazing beauty of the sexy Patti Hansen, the future Mrs. Keith Richards; the always wonderful, even being fifty-two years old, Audrey Hepburn; and the song \"Amigo\", from Roberto Carlos. Although I do not like him, Roberto Carlos has been the most popular Brazilian singer since the end of the 60's and is called by his fans as \"The King\". I will keep this movie in my collection only because of these attractions (manly Dorothy Stratten). My vote is four.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): \"Muito Riso e Muita Alegria\" (\"Many Laughs and Lots of Happiness\")",
    "This film is just plain horrible. John Ritter doing pratt falls, 75% of the actors delivering their lines as if they were reading them from cue cards, poor editing, horrible sound mixing (dialogue is tough to pick up in places over the background noise), and a plot that really goes nowhere. I didn't think I'd ever say this, but Dorothy Stratten is not the worst actress in this film. There are at least 3 others that suck more. Patti Hansen delivers her lines with the passion of Ben Stein. I started to wonder if she wasn't dead inside. Even Bogdanovich's kids are awful (the oldest one is definitely reading her lines from a cue card). This movie is seriously horrible. There's a reason Bogdanovich couldn't get another project until 4 years later. Please don't watch it. If you see it in your television listings, cancel your cable. If a friend suggests it to you, reconsider your friendship. If your spouse wants to watch it, you're better off finding another soulmate. I'd rather gouge my eyes out with lawn darts than sit through this piece of garbage again. If I could sum this film up in one word, that word would be: Suckotrocity",
    "My interest in Dorothy Stratten caused me to purchase this video. Although it had great actors/actresses, there were just too many subplots going on to retain interest. Plus it just wasn't that interesting. Dialogue was stiff and confusing and the story just flipped around too much to be believable. I was pretty disappointed in what I believe was one of Audrey Hepburn's last movies. I'll always love John Ritter best in slapstick. He was just too pathetic here.",
    "I think I will make a movie next weekend. Oh wait, I'm working..oh I'm sure I can fit it in. It looks like whoever made this film fit it in. I hope the makers of this crap have day jobs because this film sucked!!! It looks like someones home movie and I don't think more than $100 was spent making it!!! Total crap!!! Who let's this stuff be released?!?!?!",
    "Pros: Nothing<br /><br />Cons: Everything<br /><br />Plot summary: A female reporter runs into a hitchhiker that tells her stories about the deaths of people that were killed by zombies.<br /><br />Review: Never in my life have I come across a movie as bad The Zombie Chronicles. Filmed on a budget of what looks to be about 20 bucks, TZC is a completely horrible horror movie that relies on lame, forgetable actors whom couldn't act to save their lives and gore that's more gross than frightening. How does a movie like this even get made? Simply put, avoid TZC like a sexually-transmitted disease.<br /><br />My last 2 cents: Humorously enough, this movie was made by a movie company called Brain Damage Films. They're brains must have really been damaged to come up with a craptacular movie like this.<br /><br />My rating: 1 out of 10(If it were up to me, this movie would get the rating of negative bajillion)",
    "If the crew behind \"Zombie Chronicles\" ever read this, here's some advice guys: <br /><br />1. In a \"Twist Ending\"-type movie, it's not a good idea to insert close-ups of EVERY DEATH IN THE MOVIE in the opening credits. That tends to spoil the twists, y'know...? <br /><br />2. I know you produced this on a shoestring and - to be fair - you worked miracles with your budget but please, hire people who can actually act. Or at least, walk, talk and gesture at the same time. Joe Haggerty, I'm looking at you...<br /><br />3. If you're going to set a part of your movie in the past, only do this if you have the props and costumes of the time.<br /><br />4. Twist endings are supposed to be a surprise. Sure, we don't want twists that make no sense, but signposting the \"reveal\" as soon as you introduce a character? That's not a great idea.<br /><br />Kudos to the guys for trying, but in all honesty, I'd rather they hadn't...<br /><br />Only for zombie completists.",
    "1st watched 8/3/2003 - 2 out of 10(Dir-Brad Sykes): Mindless 3-D movie about flesh-eating zombies in a 3 story within a movie chronicle. And yes, we get to see zombies eating human flesh parts in 3D!! Wow, not!! That has been done time and time again in 2D in a zombie movie but what usually makes a zombie movie better is the underlying story not the actual flesh-eating. That's what made the original zombie classics good. The flesh-eating was just thrown in as an extra. We're actually bored throughout most of this 3-part chronicle because of the lame(twilight-zone like) easily understood and slow-pacingly revealed finale's. The last story is actually the story the movie started with(having a reporter investigating a so-called ghost town) and of course we get to see flesh eating zombie's in that one as well. Well, I think I've said enough. Watch the classics, not this 3D bore-feast.",
    "There's tons of good-looking women in this flick. But alas, this movie is nudity-free. Grrrrrrrrrr Strike one.<br /><br />Ahem. One story in this film takes place in 1971. Then why the hell are the main characters driving a Kia Sportage? Hello? Continuity, anyone?<br /><br />As you might know, this movie was released in stereoscopic 3D. And it is the most hideous effect I have ever seen. I'm not sure if someone botched the job on this, but there WAS no 3D, just double-vision blurs. I didn't have the same problem with this company's other 3D movies, HUNTING SEASON and CAMP BLOOD. Sure, the 3D in those ones sucked too, but with them I could see a semblance of 3D effect.<br /><br />This thing is a big ball of nothing.<br /><br />And whoever that women was who played the daughter of the ear-eating dame, yum! I'd like to see more of her. In movies, as well. Looks like Janet Margolin at a young age. Purrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr<br /><br />",
    "En route to a small town that lays way off the beaten track (but which looks suspiciously close to a freeway), a female reporter runs into a strange hitch-hiker who agrees to help direct her to her destination. The strange man then recounts a pair of gruesome tales connected to the area: in the first story, an adulterous couple plot to kill the woman's husband, but eventually suffer a far worse fate themselves when they are attacked by a zombie; and in the second story, a group of campers have their vacation cut short when an undead outlaw takes umbrage at having his grave peed on.<br /><br />The Zombie Chronicles is an attempt by writer Garrett Clancy and director Brad Sykes at making a zombie themed anthologya nice idea, but with only two stories, it falls woefully short. And that's not the only way in which this low budget gore flick fails to deliver: the acting is lousy (with Joe Haggerty, as the tale-telling Ebenezer Jackson, giving one of the strangest performances I have ever seen); the locations are uninspired; the script is dreary; there's a sex scene with zero nudity; and the ending.... well, that beggars belief.<br /><br />To be fair, some of Sykes' creative camera-work is effective (although the gimmicky technique employed as characters run through the woods is a tad overused) and Joe Castro's cheapo gore is enthusiastic: an ear is bitten off, eyeballs are plucked out, a face is removed, brains are squished, and there is a messy decapitation. These positives just about make the film bearable, but be warned, The Zombie Chronicles ain't a stroll in the park, even for seasoned viewers of z-grade trash.<br /><br />I give The Zombie Chronicles 2/10, but generously raise my rating to 3 since I didn't get to view the film with the benefit of 3D (although I have a sneaking suspicion that an extra dimension wouldn't have made that much of a difference).",
    "Without wishing to be a killjoy, Brad Sykes is responsible for at least two of the most dull and clichéd films i've ever seen - this being one of them, and Camp Blood being another. <br /><br />The acting is terrible, the print is shoddy, and everything about this film screams \"seriously, you could do better yourself\". Maybe this is a challenge to everyone to saturate youtube with our own zombie related crap?<br /><br />I bought this for £1, but remember, you can't put a price on 71 minutes of your life. You'd do well to avoid this turkey, even at a bargain basement price.",
    "My girlfriend once brought around The Zombie Chronicles for us to watch as a joke. Little did we realize the joke was on her for paying £1 for it. While watching this film I started to come up with things I would rather be doing than watching The Zombie Chronicles. These included:<br /><br />1) Drinking bleach 2) Rubbing sand in my eyes 3) Writing a letter to Brad Sykes and Garrett Clancy 4) Re-enacting the American civil war 5) Tax returns 6) GCSE Maths 7) Sex with an old lady.<br /><br />Garrett Clancy, aka Sgt. Ben Draper wrote this? The guy couldn't even dig a hole properly. The best ting he did was kick a door down (the best part of the film). This was the worst film I have ever seen, and I've seen White Noise: The Light. Never has a film had so many mistakes in it. My girlfriend left it here, so now I live with the shame of owning this piece of crap.<br /><br />News just in: Owen Wilson watched this film and tried to kill himself. Fact.<br /><br />DO NOT WATCH",
    "Amateur, no budget films can be surprisingly good ... this however is not one of them.<br /><br />Ah, another Brad Sykes atrocity. The acting is hideous, except for Emmy Smith who shows some promise. The camera \"direction\" needs serious reworking. And no more \"hold the camera and run\" gimmicks either; it just doesn't work. The special effects are unimaginative, there's a problem when the effect can be identified in real time. If you're going to rip off an ear, please don't let us see the actor's real ear beneath the blood. The scenery is bland and boring (same as Mr. Sykes other ventures), and the music is a cross between cheap motel porn and really bad guitar driven metal (see the scenery comment).<br /><br />Did I mention the lack of any real plot, or character development? Apparently, the scriptwriter didn't.<br /><br />Whoever is funding this guy ... please stop. I've seen some of his other \"home movies\" (which I will not plug) and they are just as bad. Normally, a \"director\" will grow and learn from his previous efforts ... not this guy. It's one thing to be an amateur filmmaker, but anyone can be a hack.<br /><br />Definitely not even a popcorn film ... of course, chewing on popcorn kernels would be less painful than this effort.<br /><br />Award: The worst ever military push-ups in a film.",

    "Some films that you pick up for a pound turn out to be rather good - 23rd Century films released dozens of obscure Italian and American movie that were great, but although Hardgore released some Fulci films amongst others, the bulk of their output is crap like The Zombie Chronicles.<br /><br />The only positive thing I can say about this film is that it's nowhere near as annoying as the Stink of Flesh. Other than that, its a very clumsy anthology film with the technical competence of a Lego house built by a whelk.<br /><br />It's been noted elsewhere, but you really do have to worry about a film that inserts previews of the action into its credit sequence, so by the time it gets to the zombie attacks, you've seen it all already.<br /><br />Bad movie fans will have a ball watching the 18,000 continuity mistakes and the diabolical acting of the cast (especially the hitchhiker, who was so bad he did make me laugh a bit), and kudos to Hardgore for getting in to the spirit of things by releasing a print so bad it felt like I was watching some beat up home video of a camping trip.<br /><br />Awful, awful stuff. We've all made stuff like this when we've gotten a hold of a camera, but common sense prevails and these films languish in our cupboards somewhere. Avoid.",

    "I have not seen many low budget films i must admit, but this is the worst movie ever probably, the main character the old man talked like, he had a lobotomy and lost the power to speak more than one word every 5 seconds, a 5 year old could act better. The story had the most awful plot, and well the army guy had put what he thought was army like and then just went over the top, i only watched it to laugh at how bad it was, and hoped it was leading onto the real movie. I cant believe it was under the 2 night rental thing at blockbusters, instead of a please take this for free and get it out of our sight. I think there was one semi decent actor other than the woman, i think the only thing OK with the budget was the make up, but they show every important scene of the film in the beginning music bit. Awful simply awful.",
    "..Oh wait, I can! This movie is not for the typical film snob, unless you want to brush up on your typical cinematic definitions, like \"continuity editing\" and \"geographic match\". I couldn't tell where I was in this movie. One second they're in the present, next minute their supposedly in the 70's driving a modern SUV and wearing what looked like to me as 80's style clothing. I think. I couldn't pay long enough attention to it since the acting was just horrible. I think it only got attention because it has a 3d which I did not watch. If you're a b-movie buff, and by b-movie I mean BAD movie, then this film is for you. It's home-movie and all non-sense style will keep you laughing for as long as you can stay awake. If your tastes are more for Goddard and Antonioni, though, just skip this one.",
    "You have to admire Brad Sykes even if you don't particularly want to, a man who churns out budget horror after budget horror to less than enthusiastic receptions. But keeps on doing it all the same. Even the half-hearted praise than surrounds his Camp Blood films is given grudgingly and I'm as guilty of this as anyone. Brad normally manages to throw something interesting into the mix, a neat idea, a kooky character, whatever, but without the funds to take it further than base level, he relies on the audience to cut him some slack and appreciate it for what it is and what it could be. Joe Haggerty gives a spirited and very funny performance as Ebenezer Jackson and its a credit to Sykes that he can sense that this oddball turn is going to work within the framework of the film. Coming to a multiplex near you, in a parallel universe, somewhere.",
    "THE ZOMBIE CHRONICLES <br /><br />Aspect ratio: 1.33:1 (Nu-View 3-D)<br /><br />Sound format: Mono<br /><br />Whilst searching for a (literal) ghost town in the middle of nowhere, a young reporter (Emmy Smith) picks up a grizzled hitchhiker (Joseph Haggerty) who tells her two stories involving flesh-eating zombies reputed to haunt the area.<br /><br />An ABSOLUTE waste of time, hobbled from the outset by Haggerty's painfully amateurish performance in a key role. Worse still, the two stories which make up the bulk of the running time are utterly routine, made worse by indifferent performances and lackluster direction by Brad Sykes, previously responsible for the likes of CAMP BLOOD (1999). This isn't a 'fun' movie in the sense that Ed Wood's movies are 'fun' (he, at least, believed in what he was doing and was sincere in his efforts, despite a lack of talent); Sykes' home-made movies are, in fact, aggravating, boring and almost completely devoid of any redeeming virtue, and most viewers will feel justifiably angry and cheated by such unimaginative, badly-conceived junk. The 3-D format is utterly wasted here.",
    "A woman asks for advice on the road to reach a mysterious town, and hears two ghoulish stories from the local weirdo, both zombie related. But perhaps fate has something nasty in store for her too...<br /><br />The Zombie Chronicles is absolutely one of the worst films I have ever seen. In fact I must confess, so bad was it I fast forwarded through most of the garbage. And there was a lot of that, believe me. It runs for just 69 minutes, and there is still tons of filler. You get some skinhead doing a lot of push ups, plenty of dull kissy-kissy scenes between goofy teens (that rhymed, tee hee) and some fine examples of why some people should never become actors.<br /><br />As for the title characters, they barely even have a footnote in the film. Why, you get more undead action in the intro than you do the preceding feature! Though, considering how pathetic the eyes bursting out of sockets and the eating of brains sequences are (amongst other 'delights'), maybe that's a blessing in disguise.<br /><br />And to top it all off, it looks likes it's been filmed on someone's mobile phone for broadcast on Youtube. Jerky camera-work, scratches on the print, flickering lights... I had to rub my eyes when I realised it was made in 2001, and not 1971. Even the clothes and fashioned look about three decades out of date!<br /><br />If you think I'm not qualified to do a review of Chronicles having not seen the whole film, then go ahead. YOU try sitting through it, I betcha you won't even make it to the first appearance of the blue-smartie coloured freaks before making your excuses and leaving. It is truly laughable that anyone chose to release it, and honestly you'll get far more fun resting your drink on the disc than actually torturing your DVD player with this gigglesome excuse for horror. In fact, don't for surprised if it packs it's bags and leaves in the morning, leaving you doomed to watch VHS tapes for the rest of your life. You have been warned... 0/10<br /><br />P.S What kind of 18-rated horror has the woman keep a massive sports bra on during the obligatory sex scene?! See, the movie can't even get that part right...",
    "Really, I can't believe that I spent $5 on this movie. I am a huge zombie fanatic and thought the movie couldn't be that bad. It had zombies in it right? Was I wrong! To be honest the movie had it's moments...I thought it was cool when the guy got his head ripped off but that was about it. Overall I think that it would be more enjoyable to slide down a razorblade slide on my bare nutsack into a vat of vinegar then watch this movie again. The movie could have been better if we could see some boob but I had to watch the trailers for the other movies produced by this company to see that. Buyer beware...unless you are into masochism.",
    "I rented this movie about 3 years ago, and it still stands out in my mind as the worst movie ever made. I don't think I ever finished it. It is worse than a home video made by a high school student. I remember them doing a flashback to 1970 something and in the flashback there was a man with a polo shirt, oakley sunglasses and a newer SUV, like a Toyota Rav-4 or something (I don't remember). I don't understand how they could have possibly said that to be in the 70s. He might have had a cell phone too, I cant remember, It was just horrible. I returned it to the video store and asked them why they even carry the movie and if I could get the hour of my life back. To this day it is the worst movie I have ever seen, and I have seen some pretty bad ones.",
    ":Spoilers:<br /><br />I was very disappointed in Love's Abiding Joy. I had been waiting a really long time to see it and I finally got the chance when it re-aired Thursday night on Hallmark. I love the first three \"Love\" movies but this one was nothing like I thought it was going to be. The whole movie was sad and depressing, there were way to many goofs, and the editing was very poor - to many scenes out of context. I also think the death of baby Kathy happened way to soon and Clarks appearance in the movie just didn't seem to fit. It seemed like none of the actors really wanted to be there - they were all lacking emotion. There seemed to be no interaction between Missie and Willie at all.<br /><br />I think the script writers should have went more by the book. It seems like every movie that's been made so far just slips further and further away from Janette Oke's writings. I mean in the movie they never mentioned a thing about the mine and the two boys or Clark getting hurt because of it. And I think Missie and Willies reactions to Kathy's death could have been shown and heard rather than just heard.<br /><br />Out of the four movies that have been made so far I'd have to say that Love's Abiding Joy is my least favorite. I hope with the next four movies that more of the book is followed and if Clarks character is in them I hope he's got a bigger part and I hope his part isn't so bland. I also hope there is more of Scottie and Cookie and maybe even Marty but who knows what the script writers will have in store next.",
    "I've seen all four of the movies in this series. Each one strays further and further from the books. This is the worst one yet. My problem is that it does not follow the book it is titled after in any way! The directors and producers should have named it any thing other than \"Love's Abiding Joy.\" The only thing about this movie that remotely resembles the book are the names of some of the characters (Willie, Missie, Henry, Clark, Scottie and Cookie). The names/ages/genders of the children are wrong. The entire story line is no where in the book.<br /><br />I find it a great disservice to Janette Oke, her books and her fans to produce a movie under her title that is not correct in any way. The music is too loud. The actors are not convincing - they lack emotions.<br /><br />If you want a good family movie, this might do. It is clean. Don't watch it, though, if you are hoping for a condensed version of the book. I hope that this will be the last movie from this series, but I doubt it. If there are more movies made, I wish Michael Landon, Jr and others would stick closer to the original plot and story lines. The books are excellent and, if closely followed, would make excellent movies!",
    "I very much looked forward to this movie. Its a good family movie; however, if Michael Landon Jr.'s editing team did a better job of editing, the movie would be much better. Too many scenes out of context. I do hope there is another movie from the series, they're all very good. But, if another one is made, I beg them to take better care at editing. This story was all over the place and didn't seem to have a center. Which is unfortunate because the other movies of the series were great. I enjoy the story of Willie and Missy; they're both great role models. Plus, the romantic side of the viewers always enjoy a good love story.",
    "I have read all of the Love Come Softly books. Knowing full well that movies can not use all aspects of the book,but generally they at least have the main point of the book. I was highly disappointed in this movie. The only thing that they have in this movie that is in the book is that Missy's father comes to visit,(although in the book both parents come). That is all. The story line was so twisted and far fetch and yes, sad, from the book, that I just couldn't enjoy it. Even if I didn't read the book it was too sad. I do know that Pioneer life was rough,but the whole movie was a downer. The rating is for having the same family orientation of the film that makes them great.",
    "As a Southern Baptist, it pains me that I must give a below average rating to an overtly Christian movie. There certainly aren't so many that I want to discourage film-makers from a genre that's woefully under-exploited. Still, I must honestly say that \"Love's Abiding Joy\" is a typically low budget, low key, self-consciously Christian film. The plot is predictable, the acting mediocre (I'm being kind), and the editing atrocious. As a TV movie it might have been slightly above average, but as a feature film it leaves much to be desired. Keep trying guys. You've got to have a movie about about real Christians inside you somewhere. Might I suggest you turn to G. K. Chesterton or C. S. Lewis for some inspiration?",
    "As a kid I did think the weapon the murderer wielded was cool, however I was a kid and so I was a bit dumb. Even as a dumb kid though the movies plot was stupid and a bit boring when the killer was not using his light knife to kill people. What amazes me is that the movie has a really solid cast in it. What script did they read when agreeing to be in this movie as it is most assuredly boring and only a means to show off a light saber on a very small scale. The plot at times is incomprehensible and the end is totally chaotic. The whole film seems to rotate around aliens and the one weapon. The plot has two kids and some dude having an alien encounter, flash years later and there seems to be a return as it were in the mix. Dead animals and such to be explored and for some reason the one dude gets the weapon of the aliens and proceeds to use it to go on a very light killing spree. Seriously, you just have to wonder why this movie was made, if you are going to have a killer have some good death scenes, if you are going to have alien encounters show more than a weird light vortex thing, and if you are going to have light sabers then call yourself star wars.",
    "Jill Dunne (played by Mitzi Kapture), is an attractive, nice woman, over-whelmed by a smart-mouthed teenage daughter, Liv (Martha MacIsaac) and a petty, two-timing husband, Sean (Rick Roberts), both of which were tediously self-centered, and obnoxious.<br /><br />This was advertised as a troubled family stalked by a crazed killer during a relentless storm.<br /><br />The storm doesn't even happen until about the last 5 minutes of the film, and then it isn't anything to send anybody running to the storm cellar.<br /><br />The stalking, likewise doesn't get intense until almost the end of the film.<br /><br />Most of the film we spend listening to Jill and her insufferable daughter, Liv, argue until I just wanted to back slap the daughter into next week.<br /><br />Jill's problem with Liv is that she has taken up with Zack, a boy of questionable character, and they are constantly making out--in fact Jill comes home to find the two of them on Liv's bed.<br /><br />The rest of the time we spend listening to Jill's husband Sean either whine at Jill or criticize her.<br /><br />Sean was not at all appealing--since his face is so covered in freckles you could play connect the dots.<br /><br />The story begins with Jill being notified of an out-standing bill on their credit card for a hotel she has never been to, and that she thought Sean had never been to either.<br /><br />Jill goes to the hotel where she meets the owner & manager, Richard Grant (Nick Mancuso), a very nice, older, divorced man, who is sympathetic to her. In fact, when he spots her husband there again, he phones Jill and tips her off.<br /><br />Jill returns to the hotel, sees Sean with another woman. She is upset, leaves without Sean seeing her, and does absolutely nothing. In fact, she doesn't even say anything to Sean when he arrives home.

In fact, he seems a bit more aggressive than necessary, when Jill suddenly decides to cut out.<br /><br />Jill and Sean have a confrontation about his cheating. Sean whines about how Jill has been letting him down since her father died. Apparently his lack of any morals is all her fault. Eventually Jill confesses her own lack of morals and near adultery to Sean--and of course that's all her fault too, as far as Sean is concerned.<br /><br />The little family decides to go on a camping trip--which means more whining and grousing among them, especially from the spoiled daughter.<br /><br />I was so rooting for the stalker to get everybody, but Jill.<br /><br />3 stars",
    "This movie sucked. It really was a waste of my life. The acting was atrocious, the plot completely implausible. Long, long story short, these people get \"terrorized\" by this pathetic \"crazed killer\", but completely fail to fight back in any manner. And this is after they take a raft on a camping trip, with no gear, and show up at a campsite that is already assembled and completely stocked with food and clothes and the daughters headphones. Additionally, after their boat goes missing, they panic that they're stuck in the woods, but then the daughters boyfriend just shows up and they apparently never consider that they could just hike out of the woods like he did to get to them. Like I said, this movie sucks. A complete joke. Don't let your girlfriend talk you into watching it.",
    "Lifetime did it again. Can we say stupid? I couldn't wait for it to end. The plot was senseless. The acting was terrible! Especially by the teenagers. The story has been played a thousand times! Are we just desperate to give actors a job? The previews were attractive and I was really looking for a good thriller.Once in awhile lifetime comes up with a good movie, this isn't one of them. Unless one has nothing else to do I would avoid this one at all cost. This was a waste of two hours of my life. Can I get them back? I would have rather scraped my face against a brick wall for two hours then soaked it in peroxide. That would have been more entertaining.",
    "I have to say I am really surprised at the high ratings for this movie. I found it to be absolutely idiotic. The mother gets \"visions\" when she touches certain things or people? And one thing she touched twice made her vision continue... Just seemed so ridiculous. Deedee Pfieffer's performance was awful I thought. She was very irritating. The girl who played Lori did a good job and so did most of the supporting cast for what they had to work with.<br /><br />I usually love LMN and am very open minded when it comes to movies but this movie seemed to have a ridiculous plot and over the top acting and it just was not for me.",
    "The original book of this was set in the 1950s but that won't do for the TV series because most people watch for the 1930s style. Ironically the tube train near the end was a 1950s train painted to look like a 1930s train so the Underground can play at that game too. Hanging the storyline on a plot about the Jarrow March was feeble but the 50s version had students who were beginning to think about the world around them so I suppose making them think about the poverty of the marchers is much the same thing. All the stuff about Japp having to cater for himself was weak too but they had to put something in to fill the time. This would have made a decent half hour show or they could have filmed the book and made it a better long show. It is obvious this episode is a victim of style over content.",
    "The annoying mouse and lullaby really got to me and really had nothing to do with the story...It's something I would have done my 1st year in film school. Very sad. Additionally, the story just seemed to drag on for no apparent reason...there were too many things just thrown in there that had nothing to do with the story, which makes me feel that the creative team didn't really know what they were doing, or just that it should have been shorter...which would have been a blessing, not a crime. As I have just watched all of the episodes up to this point over the past week...I'd have to say that this was by far the worst, and I just wanted to warn others not to start with this one.",
    "I saw this film opening weekend in Australia, anticipating with an excellent cast of Ledger, Edgerton, Bloom, Watts and Rush that the definitive story of Ned Kelly would unfold before me. Unfortunately, despite an outstanding performance by Heath Ledger in the lead role, the plot was paper thin....which doesn't inspire me to read \"Our Sunshine\". There were some other plus points, the support acting from Edgerton in particular, assured direction from Jordan (confirming his talent on show in Buffalo Soldiers as well), and production design that gave a real feel of harshness to the Australian bush, much as the Irish immigrants of the early 19th century must have seen it. But I can't help feeling that another opportunity has been missed to tell the real story of an Australian folk hero (or was he?)....in what I suspect is a concession to Hollywood and selling the picture in the US. Oh well, at least Jordan and the producers didn't agree to lose the beards just to please Universal...<br /><br />Guess I will just have to content myself with Peter Carey's excellent \"Secret History of the Kelly Gang\". 4/10",
    "I saw this at the premiere in Melbourne<br /><br />It is shallow, two-dimensional, unaffecting and, hard to believe given the subject matter, boring. The actors are passable, but they didn't have much to work with given the very plodding and unimpressive script. For those who might have worried that Ned Kelly would be over-intellectualised, you can take comfort in the fact that this telling of the story is utterly without any literary depth at all, told entirely on the surface and full of central casting standards. However, it doesn't work as a popcorn film either. Its pacing is too off-kilter and its craft is too lacking to satisfy even on the level of a mundane actioner.<br /><br />I very much doubt Gregor Jordan could sit back and say to himself \"this is the best I could have done with the material\".<br /><br />Ned Kelly is a fascinating figure, and equally so is the national response to him. Possibly folk genius, possibly class warrior, possibly psychopath and probably all these things, he has dominated Australian true mythology for over 120 years. Once again, his story has failed miserably on the big screen.<br /><br />Such is life.",
    "Ned Kelly (Ledger), the infamous Australian outlaw and legend. Sort of like Robin Hood, with a mix of Billy the Kid, Australians love the legend of how he stood up against the English aristocratic oppression, and united the lower classes to change Australia forever. The fact that the lower classes of the time were around 70% immigrant criminals seems to be casually skimmed around by this film. Indeed, quite a few so called `facts' in this film are, on reflection, a tad dubious.<br /><br />I suppose the suspicions should have been aroused when, in the opening credits, it was claimed that this film is based upon the book, `Our Sunshine'. If ever a romanticized version of truth could be seen in a name for a book, there it was. This wasn't going to be a historical epic, but just an adaptation of one of many dubious legends of Ned Kelly, albeit a harsh and sporadically brutal version.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Ned Kelly is nothing more than an overblown Hallmark channel `real life historical drama' wannabe! The story plods along at an alarming rate (alarming because never has a film plodded so slowly!) The feeling of numbness after the two hours of pure drivel brought back memories of Costner's awful Wyatt Earp all those years ago. Simply put, nothing happens in the film, but it takes a long time getting to that nothing. This would possibly have been a tad more bearable if the performances were good (because the direction sure as heck wasn't). However, unless you are looking to play a game of spot the worst Oirish accent, then you're gonna be disappointed. Between that, the game of `Who has the stupidest beard?', `Spot the obvious backstabber!' (clue, they are all ginger for some reason), and `Nature in Australia.including lions', it is an experience similar to flicking through Hallmark, The History Channel, Discovery Channel, and Neighbours whilst suffering a huge hangover. Yup, nature pops up a lot, as to fill even more time (possibly an attempt to look arty), the film keeps showing pointless wildlife shots, and once all the native species are shown, here's a circus to allow for a camel and a lion (which is used during one fight to try to make us actually feel more sorry for the lion than the massacred people).<br /><br />This is a turgid, emotionless piece of historical fluff which should have gone straight to TV. There isn't even one good word I can say about this film. Even the usually fantastic Rush seems embarrassed to be here. When one of the characters comments that there is only 2 bullets left for him and his pal, I myself was wishing I had a gun to blow any memory of this film out of my head!",
    "They constructed this one as a kind of fantasy Man From Snowy River meets Butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid, and just for a romantic touch Ned and Joe get to play away with high class talent, the bored young wives of wealthy older men. OK, there are lots of myths about Ned Kelly, but there are also a lot of well documented facts, still leaving space for artistic creativity in producing a good historical dramaticisation. I mean, this is not the Robin Hood story, not the Arthurian legends, not Beowulf, not someone whose life is so shrouded in the mists of many many centuries past that any recreation of their life and times is 99% guesswork. It's only a couple of lifetimes ago. My own grandparents were already of school age when Ned was hanged. <br /><br />So it's silly me for fancifully imagining this movie was a serious attempt to tell the Kelly story. Having recently read Peter Carey's excellent novel \"The True History of the Kelly Gang\" I had eagerly anticipated that this would be in similar vein. But no, the fact is that Mick Jagger's much derided 1970 Kelly was probably far closer to reality, and a better movie overall, which isn't saying a whole lot for it.<br /><br />Glad it only cost me two bucks to hire the DVD! I'll give it 3/10, and that's only because some of the nice shots of the Australian bush make me feel generous.",
    "This has to be the worst piece of garbage I've seen in a while.<br /><br />Heath Ledger is a heartthrob? He looked deformed. I wish I'd known that he and Naomi Watts are an item in real life because I spent 2 of the longest hours of my life wondering what she saw in him. <br /><br />Orlando Bloom is a heartthrob? With the scraggly beard and deer-in-the-headlights look about him, I can't say I agree.<br /><br />Rachel Griffiths was her usual fabulous self, but Geoffrey Rush looked as if he couldn't wait to get off the set. <br /><br />I'm supposed to feel sorry for bankrobbers and murderers? This is a far cry from Butch Cassidy, which actually WAS an entertaining film. This was trite, cliche-ridden and boring. We only stayed because we were convinced it would get better. It didn't.<br /><br />The last 10-15 minutes or so were unintentionally hilarious. Heath and his gang are holed up in a frontier hotel, and women and children are dying because of their presence. That's not funny. But it was funny when they walked out of the hotel with the armor on, because all we could think of was the Black Knight from Monty Python and the Holy Grail. I kept waiting for them to say \"I'll bite yer leg off!\" We were howling with laughter, as were several other warped members of the audience. When we left, pretty much everyone was talking about what a waste of time this film was.<br /><br />I may not have paid cash to see this disaster (sneak preview), but it certainly wasn't free. It cost me 2 hours of my life that I will never get back.",
    "If the term itself were not geographically and semantically meaningless, one might well refer to \"Ned Kelly\" as an \"Australian Western.\" For the people Down Under, Ned Kelly was, apparently, a folk hero bandit akin to Robin Hood, Jesse James, Bonnie and Clyde, and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. The descendant of Irish immigrants, Kelly became a fugitive and an outlaw after he was falsely accused of shooting an Australian law officer, a crime for which his equally innocent mother was put into prison. To get back at the government for this mistreatment, Kelly, his brother Dan, and two other companions, became notorious bank robbers, winning over the hearts of many people in the countryside while striking a blow for justice in a land where Irish immigrants were often treated with disrespect and disdain by those who ran the country.<br /><br />Perhaps because we've encountered this \"gentleman bandit\" scenario so many times in the past, \"Ned Kelly\" feels awfully familiar and unoriginal as it pays homage to any number of the genre's stereotypes and clichés on its way to the inevitable showdown. Ned is the typical heart-of-gold lawbreaker who kills only when he is forced to and, even then, only with the deepest regret. He also has the pulse of the common folk, as when, in the middle of a bank robbery, he returns a valuable watch to one of the customers, after one of his gang has so inconsiderately pilfered it. What movie on this particular subject hasn't featured a scene like that? It's acts of selective generosity like this, of course, that earn him the love and respect of all the little people who come to secretly admire anyone who can get away with sticking it to the powers-that-be and the status quo. Geoffrey Rush plays the typical bedeviled law enforcer who feels a personal stake in bringing down this upstart troublemaker who keeps getting away with tweaking the establishment. There's even the inevitable episode in which one of the ladies being held up goes into the next room and has sex with one of the robbers, so turned on is she by the romantic derring-do of the criminal lifestyle. And the film is riddled with one hackneyed scene like this after another.<br /><br />Heath Ledger fails to distinguish himself in the title role, providing little in the way of substance to make his character either interesting or engaging. It doesn't help that he has been forced to provide a droning voice-over narration that underlines the sanctimoniousness and pretentiousness of both the character and the film.<br /><br />\"Ned Kelly\" might serve a function of sorts as a lesson in Australian history, but as an entertainment, it's just the same old story told with different accents.",
    "This movie was so unrelentingly bad, I could hardly believe I was watching it. The directing, editing, production, and script all seemed as though they had been done by junior high school students who don't know all that much about movies. There was no narrative flow that made any sort of sense. Big emotional moments and climaxes (like one early on between Heath Ledger and Naomi Watts) and character relationships (like one hinted at at the very beginning) come completely out of no where and are not set up like they would have been in a more elegantly and effectively made film. The characters are sadly underdeveloped, making it difficult for us to have any sort of connection with them. The acting, surprisingly, is not entirely bad, but the terrible writing cancels out the relatively convincing performances. The film plays like a particularly bad T.V. western/epic, and sadly diminishes the fascinating (true) story that it attempts to tell. I have read a lot of reviews that defend the film as being important to Australians because of the subject matter. That's all very well, but just because Ned Kelly is an important Australian historical icon DOESN'T MAKE THE MOVIE GOOD. No one is saying that the subject matter isn't good, just the quality of the movie itself. Pearl Harbor was about a very important historical event to Americans, but that doesn't mean I'm going to defend the movie and say it was good, because it was still bad. A failure all around, though Heath and Orlando are lovely to look at.",
    "This movie never made it to theaters in our area, so when it became available on DVD I was one of the first to rent it. For once, I should listened to the critics and passed on this one.<br /><br />Despite the excellent line up of actors the movie was very disappointing. I can see now why it went straight to video. <br /><br />I had thought that with Bloom, Ledger, and Rush it could have some value. All have done wonderful work in the past. <br /><br />The movie was slow moving and never pulled me in. I failed to develop much empathy for the characters and had to fight the urge to fast-forward just to get to the end. <br /><br />I do not recommend this film even if you are thinking of renting it for only for 'eye candy' purposes. It won't satisfy even that.",
    "I thought this was a very clunky, uninvolving version of a famous Australian story. Heath Ledger and Orlando Bloom were very good in their roles, and gave their characters some personality; but the whole thing felt forced and mechanical.<br /><br />The beginning could have been a lot more involving; perhaps starting with a shootout, and then flashing back for a recap of how they got there or that sort of thing. And I felt like every scene was routinely predictable and signposted, like a very bad tv soap.<br /><br />I was really looking forward to this movie, and hoping for something a lot better. The only thing I can say in its favour is that it beats the Mick Jagger version, but not by much.",
    "Ned aKelly is such an important story to Australians but this movie is awful. It's an Australian story yet it seems like it was set in America. Also Ned was an Australian yet he has an Irish accent...it is the worst film I have seen in a long time",
    "From the very beginning, the political theme of this film is so obvious and heavy handed, that the outcome is entirely predictable. Any good textbook on writing screenplays will advise layering of characters, incorporating character arcs, and three act structure. In this film you will find none of that. The police are the baddies, and consequently are shown as shallow, incompetent and cowards. It never seems to occur to the makers of this film that police might be honourable citizens who see joining the police as a good way to contribute to the wellbeing of society.<br /><br />The viewer gets no opportunity to make up his or her mind on whether Ned Kelly is a good guy or a ruthless villain. The film opens with him being arrested for stealing a horse, but we get no clue as to his guilt or innocence. We see him walk through the door of a gaol, but only know that he has been inside for three years when we hear this much later in some dialogue.<br /><br />This film contains many shots of Ned looking at the camera with a serious expression. I found the film a real chore to watch. It is the direction for modern films, and this one put me off watching any more.",
    "I guess I was attracted to this film both because of the sound of the story and the leading actor, so I gave it a chance, from director Gregor Jordan (Buffalo Soldiers). Basically Ned Kelly (Heath Ledger) is set up by the police, especially Superintendent Francis Hare (Geoffrey Rush), he is forced to go on the run forming a gang and go against them to clear his own and his family's names. That's really all I can say about the story, as I wasn't paying the fullest attention to be honest. Also starring Orlando Bloom as Joseph Byrne, Naomi Watts as Julia Cook, Laurence Kinlan as Dan Kelly, Philip Barantini as Steve Hart, Joel Edgerton as Aaron Sherritt, Kiri Paramore as Constable Fitzpatrick, Kerry Condon as Kate Kelly, Emily Browning as Grace Kelly and Rachel Griffiths as Susan Scott. Ledger makes a pretty good performance, for what it's worth, and the film does have it's eye-catching moments, particularly with a gun battle towards the end, but I can't say I enjoyed it as I didn't look at it all. Okay!",
    "I don't quite get the rating for The Amati Girls and I think I was REALLY kind giving it a 4 out of 10. What could otherwise have been a wonderful story with actually a set of more or less decent actors became a total farce in my eyes. There are so many clichés in that flick, the women's hair is just awful and most of the scenes are more than unrealistic or seem fake. There's no real passion in this movie but a bunch of actors over-acting over any limits that it hurts. It's not funny enough to be a comedy, it's too fake-sad to really touch, so in my eyes it's just not good. Watching it I couldn't believe how something like that made it to my TV set in my living room in Switzerland. But.. maybe it still was OK and it just got lost in translation? Who knows. Definitely one of the oddest movies I've ever seen and this certainly not in a good way! Sorry.",
    "This movie was awful. The ending was absolutely horrible. There was no plot to the movie whatsoever. The only thing that was decent about the movie was the acting done by Robert DuVall and James Earl Jones. Their performances were excellent! The only problem was that the movie did not do their acting performances any justice. If the script would have come close to capturing a halfway decent story, it would be worth watching. Instead, Robert DuVall's and James Earl Jones' performances are completely wasted on a god awful storyline...or lack thereof. Not only was I left waiting throughout the movie for something to happen to make the movie....well an actual movie...not just utterless dialog between characters for what ended up being absolutely no reason. It was nothing more than common dialog that would have taken place back in that period of time. There was nothing special about any of the characters. The only thing special was how Robert DuVall portrayed a rambling, senile, drunk, old man. Nothing worthy happens during the entire movie including the end. When the movie ended, I sat amazed...amazed that I sat through the entire movie waiting for something of interest to happen to make watching the movie worth while. It never happened! The cast of characters suddenly started rolling making it apparent that the movie really was over and I realized that I had just wasted 2 hours of my life watching a movie with absolutely no plot and no meaning. It wasn't even a story. The entire movie takes place in a day's worth of time. That's it. It was one day in the life (and death) of some Southerners on a plantation. How much of a story can take place in a single day (other than the movie Training Day)? The acting performances by the entire cast were excellent, but they were grossly wasted on such a disappointment of a movie...if you can even call it a movie.",
    "Holy crap. This was the worst film I have seen in a long time. All the performances are fine, but there is no plot. Really! No plot! A bunch of clowns talk about this and that and that's your film. Ug... Robert Duvall's character is senile and keeps asking the same people the same qestions over and over. This earns him the same responses over and over. I am pretty sure this film got upto a six because people think they should like it. Good performances with famous and well regarded actors, but the actual complete work is a steamy turd. Well, maybe that's a bit deceptive since steam rising from a fresh pile sounds a little like something happening and in this film NOTHING HAPPENS! Sack",
    "SWING! is an important film because it's one of the remaining Black-produced and acted films from the 1930s. Many of these films have simply deteriorated so badly that they are unwatchable, but this one is in fairly good shape. It's also a nice chance to see many of the talented Black performers of the period just after the heyday of the old Cotton Club--a time all but forgotten today.<br /><br />Unfortunately, while the film is historically important and has some lovely performances, it's also a mess. The main plot is very similar to the Hollywood musicals of the era--including a prima donna who is going to ruin the show and the surprise unknown who appears from no where to save the day. However, the writing is just god-awful and a bit trashy at times--and projects images of Black America that some might find a bit demeaning. This is because before the plot really gets going, you are treated to a no-account bum who lives off his hard working wife (a popular stereotype of the time) and when he is caught with a hussy (who, by the way, totally overplays this role), they have a fight which looks like a scene from WWE Smackdown! And, the one lady wants to cut the other lady with a straight razor--a trashy scene indeed! Later in the film, when the prima donna is behaving abominably, her husband punches her in the face and everyone applauds him! It seems like the film, at times, wants to appeal to the lowest common denominator in the audience PLUS they can't even do this well--with some of the worst acting I've seen in a very long time.<br /><br />Still, if you can look past a lousy production in just about every way (with trashy characters, bad acting and direction and poor writing), this one might be worth a peek so you can see excellent singing and tap dancing--as well as to catch a glimpse of forgotten Black culture. Just don't say I didn't warn you about the acting--it's really, really bad!",
    "There's not a drop of sunshine in \"The Sunshine Boys\", which makes the title of this alleged comedy Neil Simon's sole ironic moment. Simon, who adapted the script from his play (which goes uncredited), equates old age with irrational behavior--and, worse, clumsy, galumphing, mean-spirited irrational behavior. Walter Matthau is merciless on us playing an aged vaudeville performer talked into reuniting with former comedy partner George Burns for a television special (it's said they were a team for 43 years, which begs the question \"how long did vaudeville last, anyway?\"). Burns, who won a Supporting Oscar, has the misfortune of coming to the film some thirty minutes in, after which time Matthau has already blasted the material to hell and back. The noisier the movie gets, the less tolerable and watchable it is. Director Herbert Ross only did solid work when he wasn't coupled with one of Neil Simon's screenplays; here, Ross sets up gags like a thudding amateur, hammering away at belligerent routines which fail to pay off (such as semi-incoherent Matthau showing up at a mechanic's garage to audition for a TV commercial). At this point, Matthau was still too young for this role, and he over-compensates by slouching and hollering. It was up to Ross and Simon to tone down the character, to nuance his temperament to give \"The Sunshine Boys\" some sunniness, yet Walter continues to project as if we'd all gone deaf. The picture looks terribly drab and crawls along at a spiritless pace; one loses hope for it early on. *1/2 from ****",
    "I like Goldie Hawn and wanted another one of her films, so when I saw Protocol for $5.50 at Walmart I purchased it. Although mildly amusing, the film never really hits it a stride. Some scenes such as a party scene in a bar just goes on for too long and really has no purpose.<br /><br />Then, of course, there is the preachy scene at the end of the film which gives the whole film a bad taste as far as I'm concerned. I don't think this scene added to the movie at all. I don't like stupid comedies trying to teach me a lesson, written by some '60's burn out especially!<br /><br />In the end, although I'm glad to possess another Hawn movie, I'm not sure it was really worth the money I paid for it!",
    "Protocol is an implausible movie whose only saving grace is that it stars Goldie Hawn along with a good cast of supporting actors. The story revolves around a ditzy cocktail waitress who becomes famous after inadvertently saving the life of an Arab dignitary. The story goes downhill halfway through the movie and Goldie's charm just doesn't save this movie. Unless you are a Goldie Hawn fan don't go out of your way to see this film.",
    "What does the \" Executive producer \" do in a movie . If I remember correctly it's the person who raised the financial backing to make the movie . You might notice in a great number of movies starring Sean Connery that he is also the executive producer which meant Connery himself raised the money since he is a major player . Unfortunately it should also be pointed out that a great number of movies \" starring Sean Connery were solely made because he managed to raise the money since he's a major Hollywood player , it's usually an indication that when the credits read that the executive producer and the star of the movie are one and the same the movie itself is nothing more than a star vehicle with the story/screenplay not being up to scratch <br /><br />PROTOCOL follows the saga of one Sunny Davis a kooky bimboesque cocktail waitress who saves a visiting dignitary and as a reward gets made a top diplomat . Likely ? As things progress Ms Davis ( Who has problems being able to string two sentences together ) finds herself in more outlandish and less likely situations . When I say that PROTOCOL stars Goldie Hawn who is also the film's executive producer do you understand what I'm saying about the story/screenplay not being up to scratch ? Exactly",
    "Outlandish premise that rates low on plausibility and unfortunately also struggles feebly to raise laughs or interest. Only Hawn's well-known charm allows it to skate by on very thin ice. Goldie's gotta be a contender for an actress who's done so much in her career with very little quality material at her disposal...<br /><br />",
    "There are only two movies I would give a 1/10 to, this stinker and \"The Man who Fell to Earth.\" I remember seeing Protocol at a theater in the early 80s when I was in high school. The script is insulting to anyone (including a high school student's) intelligence. It completely lost me with the \"hillarious\" gag of someone getting shot in the butt. Goldie Hawn is supposed to be charming but comes across as vapid and moronic. Then there are offensive stereotypes about Arabs, followed by Goldie winning over everyone by spouting populist dribble. The acting was terrible, including Goldie Hawn's. I could not stand to see another movie she was in until IMO she redeemed herself in Everyone Says I Love You. This is the kind of movie you make if you want to put no effort into screenplay writing. The worst.",
    "The only good thing about this movie was the shot of Goldie Hawn standing in her little french cut bikini panties and struggling to keep a dozen other depraved women from removing her skimpy little cotton top while she giggled and cooed. Ooooof! Her loins rival those of Nina Hartley. This movie came out when I was fourteen and that shot nearly killed me. I'd forgotten about it all tucked away in the naughty Roladex of my mind until seeing it the other day on TV, where they actually blurred her midsection in that scene, good grief, reminding me what a smokin' hottie of a woman Goldie Hawn was in the '80s. Kurt Russell must have had a fun life.",
    "I'm studying Catalan, and was delighted to find El Mar, a movie with mostly Catalan dialogue, at my art-house video store.<br /><br />Hmmm... not so delighted to have seen it.<br /><br />Yes, as other reviewers have said, it's well-made, and beautifully photographed. Although the opening sequence of the children is shockingly violent, it's well-acted and convincing. (For the most part, that is... Would the Mallorquins strip a corpse in preparation for burial right in the middle of the town square, in full view of the dead man's 10-year-old boy?) Oh, well... minor detail. Up to this point, it had something of the feel of a non-magical Pan's Labyrinth, also set in the Spanish Civil War.<br /><br />Fast-forward, and the three children who survived the opening incident have come of age. Francisca is a nun working at a tuberculosis sanatorium and the two boys, Manuel and Ramallo, both are patients. I know, but hey, coincidences happen.<br /><br />The problem, as with so many Spanish movies (apologies to Almodovar fans), is that with one exception (Francisca) the characters are just so dang *weird*. Their motivations, personalities, and dialogue are often simply incoherent.<br /><br />What's more, it descends into some horrific wretched excess. Be prepared for LOTS of pain and LOTS of blood. The reviewer who called it a \"potboiler\" is quite on track. If it had been made 40 years ago, the poster would've said: SEE FORBIDDEN LOVE!! RAPE!! MURDER!! MUTILATION!! FANATICISM!! ANIMAL CRUELTY!! BETRAYAL!! <br /><br />The opening sequence is not nearly enough to make the personalities and relationships of the characters believable. To work, this should have had multiple flashbacks to flesh out the characters. As it is, it seems a bizarre and depressing cross between \"Brother Sun, Sister Moon\" and \"Pulp Fiction.\" If that sounds like something you've got to see, by all means, enjoy. I think I go with something that doesn't make me feel I need to take a shower to wash off the gore and gloom.<br /><br />As for the Catalan, it's the Mallorqui dialect, fairly different than the Barcelona dialect, though I was surprised by the comment that said that even Barcelonans apparently needed Catalan subtitles to understand it.",
    "I was excited to view a Cataluña´s film in the Berlin´s competition. But after the presentation I was total disappointed and furious. Too much blood, too much time, too much themes for nothing. The Spanish Civil War, like every war, was horrible. The revenge, a very human behavior, not pretty at all, is shown in uncountable films and plays, as well as the relations between homosexuals and the scepticism in Spain about Catholicism . But what Mr Villaronga try, is a pseudo tragedy that can belongs to the worst of the film´s history. It is really a pity to see Angela Molina in this movie. I advise nobody under no circumstances to go to see this film.",
    "this film was a major letdown. the level of relentless cruelty and violence in this film was very disturbing. some scenes were truly unnecessarily ugly and mean-spirited. the main characters were impossible to identify with or even sympathize with. the lead protagonist's character was as slimy as they come. the sickroom/hothouse atmosphere lent itself to over-the-top theatrics. little or nothing could be learned about the Spanish civil war from this film. fortunately, i've been to spain and realize this is not realistic! in addition, the use of same-sex attraction as a lurid \"horror\" was also very offensive and poorly handled, while the DVD is being packaged and advertised to attract gay viewers. the actors seemed uncomfortable in their roles,as if they were trying to distance themselves from this mess.i guess if you like watching children and pets being brutally killed,this film might especially appeal to you.",
    "Three part \"horror\" film with some guy in a boarded up house imploring the viewer not to go \"out there\" and (unfortunately) gives us three tales to prove why.<br /><br />The first story involves a young couple in a car accident who meet up with two psychos. It leads up to two totally predictable twists. Still, it's quick (about 15 minutes), violent, well-acted and well-done. Predictable but enjoyable.<br /><br />The second involves a man on the run after stealing a large amount of money. His car breaks down, he's attacked by a dog and stumbles into a nearby clinic. VERY obvious, badly done and extremely slow. Even at 30 minutes this is too long. Good acting though.<br /><br />The third is just barely a horror story. It involves a beautiful, lonely woman looking for Mr. Right. It has beautiful set designs, a nice erotic feel and a nice sex scene. But (again) predictable and not even remotely scary.<br /><br />It ends very stupidly.<br /><br />All in all, the first one is worth watching, but that's it. Tune in for that one then turn it off.",
    "A very cheesy and dull road movie, with the intention to be hip and modern, shown in the editing style and some weird camera angles, resulting only in sleepiness. <br /><br />The cast is wasted, the writing is stupid and pretentious. The only thing worthwhile is the top-notch Lalo Schifrin's soundtrack, really cool and also the opening sequence, very original and interesting. <br /><br />Run if you can, the bad opinions and comments about this flick are totally deserved; it is really pure garbage. Of course that this has its charm, of watching a movie which everybody would not drop the beer glass on if it were on fire, but save it for a stormy day where you have absolutely nothing else to do.",
    "There are some nice shots in this film, it catches some of the landscapes with such a beautiful light, in fact the cinematography is probably it's best asset.<br /><br />But it's basically more of a made for TV movie, and although it has a lot of twists and turns in the plot, which keeps it quite interesting viewing, there are no subtitles and key plot developments are unveiled in Spanish, so non Spanish speakers will be left a little lost.<br /><br />I had it as a Xmas gift, as it's a family trait to work through the films of a actor we find talented, and Matthew Mconaughey was just awesome in \"A Time to kill\" , and the \"The Newton Boys \" so I expressed I wanted to see more of his work.<br /><br />However although it says on the DVD box it is a Matthew Mconaughey film and uses this as a marketing ploy, he has a few lines and is on screen for not very minutes at the end of the film, he is basically an extra and he doesn't exactly light up the screen while he is on, so die hard fans, really not worth it from that point of view.<br /><br />The films star though, Patrick McGaw is great though and very easy on the eye, and his character is just so nice and kind and caring, a true saint of a guy, he'd be well written into a ROM com.<br /><br />So for true Mcconaughey acting brilliance of the ones I've seen, I'd recommend, \"A Time to kill\" , \"The Newton Boys \" \"Frailty\", \"How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days\", \"Edtv\" and \"Amistad\" and avoid too \"Larger Than Life\" and \"Angels in the Outfield\" unless you feel like a kids film or have kids around as neither of these are indicative of his talent, but are quite amusing films for children, again MM is really nothing more that a supporting artist with just a few if any lines.<br /><br />As for Scorpion Springit's not a bad film but it also isn't screen stealing either.",
    "I have been looking for this film for ages because it is quite rare to find as it was one of the video nasties. I finally found it on DVD at the end of last year it is a very low budget movie The story is set around amazon jungle tribes that are living in fear of the devil. Laura Crawford is a model who is kidnapped by a gang of thugs while she is working in South America. They take her into the jungle Laura is guarded by some ridiculous native who calls himself \"The Devil\" she has to go though all unpleasant things until they are happy. Maidens are Chained up. The devil demonstrates eating flesh in a horrible manner. Peter Weston, is the devil hunter, who goes into the jungle to try and rescue her,",
    "As the number of Video Nasties I've yet to see dwindles, this little pile of garbage popped up on my \"to rent\" list when I saw it was available.<br /><br />The premise involves a fashion model or something being kidnapped and taken into the jungle to be held for ransom by a motley crew of idiots. Some other goof gets hired to bring her back and is given a sack of money to use as a bargaining chip, though if he returns with the girl and all the money, he gets a significant cut. He's brought a helicopter and pilot with him and, wow, that pilot is one of the worst actors EVER! Granted, they are all totally terrible and the dubbing will make you cry blood. After stealing away into the jungle, we learn that nearby is a cannibal cult whose flesheating earthbound god wanders the woods like a human King Kong looking for tribeswomen to ravage and devour. Now, this fellow is just a naked guy with some of the worst makeup ever, ping-pong balls for eyes and that's pretty much it. His growls and groans are an everpresent feature on the soundtrack, and I found myself muting much of those scenes.<br /><br />Oh, did I forget to mention the almost constant nudity? This is probably the main reason this film was banned, though there is one specific scene, about one second long, where the god attacks a girl and pulls her guts out, but it's not a redeeming factor for gore fans. Also, Jess Franco goes beyond the usual T and A and shows lengthy close-ups of female genitals, and, sadly, male as well. So, if you want \"fair\" in terms of exploitation, you got it.<br /><br />I can't recommend this trash to anyone. It's not even the good bad movie. It's just atrociously padded trash that only a Video Nasty fan will probably view and even then, if you are making your way through the list, leave this for the very last. If you watch it first, you may get the notion that this is the norm for the list, which is certainly not true.",
    "Not sure if I'm referring to those who labeled this a video nasty or to the director...\"Devil Hunter\" sure is one bizarre 'horror' movie.<br /><br />The plot is a loosey goosey combo of superior films like \"Cannibal Ferox\" and \"Cut and Run.\" Chick gets kidnapped in the 'jungle' by a 'tribe' of 'savages.' The jungle looks more like a park somewhere in Mexico. The tribe is like a group of hippies who walk around in Party City-style Halloween costume renditions of tribal garb. And the savages range in race from white to Asian to black to hispanic. I suppose Franco just grabbed anyone who looked even slightly ethnic for this romp.<br /><br />To make matters worse, this film has ultra-minimal gore, no real scares and a lot of unnecessary penis. Not fun. I can find something to like in just about any sleazy Italian or Euro-trash film; this one just fell WAY short.<br /><br />2 out of 10, kids.",
    "This video nasty was initially banned in Britain, and allowed in last November without cuts.<br /><br />It features the Playboy Playmate of the Month October 1979, Ursula Buchfellner. The opening cuts back and forth between Buchfellner and foggy jungle pictures. I am not sure what the purpose of that was. It would have been much better to focus on the bathtub scene.<br /><br />Laura (Buchfellner) is kidnapped and held in the jungle for ransom. Peter (Al Cliver - The Beyond, Zombie) is sent to find her and the ransom. Of course, one of the kidnappers (Antonio de Cabo) manages to pass the time productively, while another (Werner Pochath) whines incessantly.<br /><br />The ransom exchange goes to hell, and Laura runs into the jungle. Will Peter save her before the cannibals have a meal? Oh, yes, there are cannibals in this jungle. Why do you think it was a video nasty! Muriel Montossé is found by Peter and his partner (Antonio Mayans - Angel of Death) on the kidnapper's boat. Montossé is very comfortably undressed. Peter leaves them and goes off alone to find Laura, who has been captured by now. They pass the time having sex, and don't see the danger approaching. Guts, anyone? Great fight between Peter and the naked devil (Burt Altman).<br /><br />Blood, decapitation, guts, lots of full frontal, some great writhing by the cannibal priestess (Aline Mess), and the line, \"They tore her heart out,\" which is hilarious if you see the film.",
    "Of the three titles from Jess Franco to find their way onto the Official DPP Video Nasty list (Devil Hunter, Bloody Moon and Women Behind Bars) this is perhaps the least deserving of notoriety, being a dreadfully dull jungle clunker enlivened only very slightly by a little inept gore, a gratuitous rape scene, and loads of nudity.<br /><br />Gorgeous blonde Ursula Buchfellner plays movie star Laura Crawford who is abducted by a gang of ruthless kidnappers and taken to a remote tropical island inhabited by a savage tribe who worship the 'devil god' that lurks in the jungle (a big, naked, bulging-eyed native who likes to eat the hearts of nubile female sacrifices).<br /><br />Employed by Laura's agent to deliver a $6million ransom, brave mercenary Peter Weston (Al Cliver) and his Vietnam vet pilot pal travel to the island, but encounter trouble when the bad guys attempt a double-cross. During the confusion, Laura escapes into the jungle, but runs straight into the arms of the island's natives, who offer her up to their god.<br /><br />Franco directs in his usual torpid style and loads this laughable effort with his usual dreadful trademarks: crap gore, murky cinematography, rapid zooms, numerous crotch shots, out of focus imagery, awful sound effects, and ham-fisted editing. The result is a dire mess that is a real struggle to sit through from start to finish (It took me a couple of sittings to finish the thing), and even the sight of the luscious Buchfellner in all of her natural glory ain't enough to make me revisit this film in a hurry.",
    "How can you tell that a horror movie is terrible? when you can't stop laughing about it of course! The plot has been well covered by other reviewers, so I'll just add a few things on the hilarity of it all.<br /><br />Some reviews have placed the location in South America, others in Africa, I thought it was in some random island in the Pacific. Where exactly does this take place, seems to be a mystery. The cannibal tribe is conformed by a couple of black women some black men, and a man who looks like a young Frank Zappa banging the drums... the Devil God is a large black man with a terrible case of pink eyes.<br /><br />One of the \"freakiest\" moments in the film is when, \"Pablito\" find his partner hanging from a tree covered in what seems to be an orange substance that I assume is blood, starts screaming for minutes on and on (that's actually funny), and then the head of his partner falls in the ground and \"Pablito\" kicks it a bit for what I assume is \"shits n' giggles\" and the eyes actually move...<br /><br />But, of course, then the \"freak\" is gone when you realize the eyes moved because the movie is just bad...<br /><br />I hadn't laughed like this in a loooong while, and I definitely recommend this film for a Sunday afternoon with your friends and you have nothing to do... grab a case of beers and start watching this film, you'll love it! If you are looking for a real horror or gore movie, though... don't' bother.",
    "An actress making a movie in Africa is kidnapped and taken into the jungle where she is held for ransom. The producer hires some one to go and bring her back. Complicating everything are the cannibals in the jungle who worship a really ugly looking \"god\" who likes to eat naked women.<br /><br />This is a gory sleazy movie. There is copious amounts of nudity and violence, not to mention violence against nude people. Its an exploitation film designed to appeal to the deepest darkest parts of our being, and if the movie wasn't so boring this film would be a classic. Lets face it, despite the gore, the nasty sex and abuse,and the ugly monster this movie is a snoozer. The pacing is all off kilter and it puts you out. There are multiple plot lines that all seem to be happening separately from each other, even though its ultimately all one story. Worst of all, almost no one says anything. Most of the minimal dialog concerns the cruelty or one characters protestations that \"I'll do what I want\". Its such a quiet and dull movie that if it weren't for the frequent screams of the victims I'd recommend this as a sleep aide.<br /><br />This is a movie to avoid unless you need sleep, or unless you need to see every Euro-cannibal movie.<br /><br />(An aside. VideoAsia just released this as part of their Terror Tales series. Their print is oddly letter-boxed which looks to be the result of taking their print from a Japanese source (there is fogging) that was cropped to remove the subtitles. Their print also has no opening titles)",
    "or anyone who was praying for the sight of Al Cliver wrestling a naked, 7ft tall black guy into a full nelson, your film has arrived! Film starlet Laura Crawford (Ursula Buchfellner) is kidnapped by a group who demand the ransom of $6 million to be delivered to their island hideaway. What they don't count on is rugged Vietnam vet Peter Weston (Cliver) being hired by a film producer to save the girl. And what they really didn't count on was a local tribe that likes to offer up young women to their monster cannibal god with bloodshot bug eyes.<br /><br />Pretty much the same filming set up as CANNIBALS, this one fares a bit better when it comes to entertainment value, thanks mostly a hilarious dub track and the impossibly goofy monster with the bulging eyes (Franco confirms they were split ping pong balls on the disc's interview). Franco gets a strong EuroCult supporting cast including Gisela Hahn (CONTAMINATION) and Werner Pochath (whose death is one of the most head-scratching things I ever seen as a guy who is totally not him is shown - in close up - trying to be him). The film features tons of nudity and the gore (Tempra paint variety) is there. The highlight for me was the world's slowly fistfight between Cliver and Antonio de Cabo in the splashing waves. Sadly, ol' Jess pads this one out to an astonishing (and, at times, agonizing) 1 hour and 40 minutes when it should have run 80 minutes tops. <br /><br />For the most part, the Severin DVD looks pretty nice but there are some odd ghosting images going on during some of the darker scenes. Also, one long section of dialog is in Spanish with no subs (they are an option, but only when you listen to the French track). Franco gives a nice 16- minute interview about the film and has much more pleasant things to say about Buchfellner than his CANNIBALS star Sabrina Siani.",
    "Devil Hunter gained notoriety for the fact that it's on the DPP 'Video Nasty' list, but it really needn't have been. Many films on the list where there for God (and DPP) only known reasons, and while this isn't the tamest of the bunch; there isn't a lot here that warrants banning...which is a shame because I never would have sat through it where it not for the fact that it's on 'the shopping list'. The plot actually gives the film a decent base - or at least more of a decent base than most cannibal films - and it follows an actress who is kidnapped and dragged off into the Amazon jungle. A hunter is then hired to find her, but along the way he has to brave the natives, lead by a man who calls himself \"The Devil\" (hence the title). The film basically just plods along for eighty five minutes and there really aren't many scenes of interest. It's a real shame that Jess Franco ended up making films like this because the man clearly has talent; as seen by films such as The Diabolical Dr Z, Venus in Furs, Faceless and She Kills in Ecstasy, but unfortunately his good films are just gems amongst heaps of crap and Devil Hunter is very much a part of the crap. I saw this film purely because I want to be able to say I've seen everything on the DPP's list (just two more to go!), and I'm guessing that's why most other people who have seen it, saw it. But if you're not on the lookout for Nasties; there really is no reason to bother with this one.",
    "This film seemed way too long even at only 75 minutes. The problem with jungle horror films is that there is always way too much footage of people walking (through the jungle, up a rocky cliff, near a river or lake) to pad out the running time. The film is worth seeing for the laughable and naked native zombie with big bulging, bloody eyes which is always accompanied on the soundtrack with heavy breathing and lots of reverb. Eurotrash fans will be plenty entertained by the bad English dubbing, gratuitous female flesh and very silly makeup jobs on the monster and native extras. For a zombie/cannibal flick this was pretty light on the gore but then I probably didn't see an uncut version.",
    "Not only is it a disgustingly made low-budget bad-acted movie, but the plot itself is just STUPID!!!<br /><br />A mystic man that eats women? (And by the looks, not virgin ones)<br /><br />Ridiculous!!! If you´ve got nothing better to do (like sleeping) you should watch this. Yeah right.",
    "This is the worst thing the TMNT franchise has ever spawned. I was a kid when this came out and I still thought it was deuce, even though I liked the original cartoon.<br /><br />There's this one scene I remember when the mafia ape guy explains to his minions what rhetorical questions are. It's atrocious. Many fans hate on the series for including a female turtle, but that didn't bother me. So much so that I didn't even remember her until I read about the show recently. All in all, it's miserably forgettable.<br /><br />The only okay thing was the theme song. Guilty pleasure, they call it... Nananana ninja...",
    "This is the biggest insult to TMNT ever. Fortunantely, officially Venus does not exist in canon TMNT. There will never be a female turtle, this took away from the tragic tale of 4 male unique mutants who will never have a family of their own, once gone no more. The biggest mistake was crossing over Power Rangers to TMNT with a horrible episode; the turtle's voices were WRONG and they all acted out of character. They could have done such a better job, better designs and animatronics and NO VENUS. <br /><br />don't bother with this people...it's cringe worthy material. the lip flap was slow and unnatural looking. they totally disrespected shredder. the main baddie, some dragonlord dude was corny. the turtles looked corny with things hanging off their bodies, what's with the thing around raph's thigh? the silly looking sculpted plastrons!? <br /><br />If they looked normal, acted in character and got rid of Venus, got rid of the stupid kiddie cartoon sounds...and better writing it could have been good.",
    "I did not like the idea of the female turtle at all since 1987 we knew the TMNT to be four brothers with their teacher Splinter and their enemies and each one of the four brothers are named after the great artists name like Leonardo , Michelangleo, Raphel and Donatello so Venus here doesn't have any meaning or playing any important part and I believe that the old TMNT series was much more better than that new one which contains Venus As a female turtle will not add any action to the story we like the story of the TMNT we knew in 1987 to have new enemies in every part is a good point to have some action but to have a female turtle is a very weak point to have some action, we wish to see more new of TMNT series but just as the same characters we knew in 1987 without that female turtle.",
    "This film is terrible. You don't really need to read this review further. If you are planning on watching it, suffice to say - don't (unless you are studying how not to make a good movie).<br /><br />The acting is horrendous... serious amateur hour. Throughout the movie I thought that it was interesting that they found someone who speaks and looks like Michael Madsen, only to find out that it is actually him! A new low even for him!!<br /><br />The plot is terrible. People who claim that it is original or good have probably never seen a decent movie before. Even by the standard of Hollywood action flicks, this is a terrible movie.<br /><br />Don't watch it!!! Go for a jog instead - at least you won't feel like killing yourself.",
    "Terrible movie. Nuff Said.<br /><br />These Lines are Just Filler. The movie was bad. Why I have to expand on that I don't know. This is already a waste of my time. I just wanted to warn others. Avoid this movie. The acting sucks and the writing is just moronic. Bad in every way. The only nice thing about the movie are Deniz Akkaya's breasts. Even that was ruined though by a terrible and unneeded rape scene. The movie is a poorly contrived and totally unbelievable piece of garbage.<br /><br />OK now I am just going to rag on IMDb for this stupid rule of 10 lines of text minimum. First I waste my time watching this offal. Then feeling compelled to warn others I create an account with IMDb only to discover that I have to write a friggen essay on the film just to express how bad I think it is. Totally unnecessary.",
    "Assuming this won't end up a straight-to-video release, I would have to say void this title at all costs. Unless you're bored of good, well-executed movies, that is. I saw this last night at AFI Dallas, and I left with 20 minutes remaining, simply because I didn't care anymore (about the plot, not about insulting the director...that is awkward). When you can spot a goof only 5 minutes into the movie (a shot out, shattered window before any shots are fired...and then the window breaks with the first shot), things are going to bad. Let's just say this is only an indicator of things to come...unfortunately.<br /><br />I'll spare you all the details, but this is sub-par in every manner, even the half-assed acting by Michael Madsen is disappointing when you're expecting half-assed acting from him. And the rape scene...Christ! \"Shut up and take it\" should never be used in a rape scene. EVER.<br /><br />3/10",
    "Sometimes a movie is so comprehensively awful it has a destructive effect on your morale. You begin to really ask yourself, what does it mean for our society that the standard is so terribly low? Can they honestly expect that we'll endure this many clichés and still be entertained?<br /><br />Of course, it is still a Hollywood mainstay to make the GUN the major character, plot device, and the source of all conflict and resolution in films. Character needs a gun. Gets a gun. Can't do that because he has a gun. Puts his gun down first. OH MY GOD What are we going to do!? He has a gun! He waves it around, acting more malicious than real human beings ever do. He pushes it in someone's face for 90 minutes, shouting questions. The hallmark of any conclusion will be the comforting sound of police sirens. <br /><br />It's a real challenge to make such a tired, hackneyed formula work again; a film has to be very clever and well executed. This one is neither. It has no life and no personality, and it will suck these components from YOU. it will make you feel WORSE about living in the time and space that you do. Really, who needs that!? So yes, I'll say it: I think this may well be the worst film I have ever seen. Anyone who was involved in the making of this sub- mediocre soul killing trash should be publicly embarrassed for the disservice they've done to us all.",
    "I have to congratulate the genius who approved this one. Edward Furlong, you're not as good as you think mate, you can't grab on every piece of low-cost amateur crap, which sole intention has to be to get some bucks.<br /><br />The filming is bad, and I mean BAD. Anyone with a camera would get the same result, or better.<br /><br />The acting, lets just say: don't go to the supermarket looking for actors. The good ones usually come with a degree or, at least, have some damn experience! The director.. Mr. Jon Keeyes, please find your purpose in life, as a director you simply suck. Your directing is poor, the angles are all messed up (not in a good way), the lines seem as if they're being read out of toilet paper, and the damn music.. it always comes up when it shouldn't and goes out for no apparent reason. And don't go for writer either, by the way. Making movies isn't like serving on a coffeshop, it requires art and skill, things I really doubt you'll ever have.<br /><br />Instead of making a badass shootout movie, you should've shot this one back to oblivion and wait 'till something good came up.. Or just go find a job on a coffeshop. You'll have less stress and you'll save movie goers some money and a bad night.<br /><br />vote: 1/10 (my first one)",
    "I rented this one on DVD without any prior knowledge. I was suspicious seeing Michael Madsen appearing in a movie I have never heard of, but it was a freebie, so why not check it out.<br /><br />Well my guess is that Mr. Blonde would very much like to forget he's ever taken part in such a shame of a film.<br /><br />Apparently, if your script and dialogs are terrible, even good actors cannot save the day. Not to mention the amateur actors that flood this film. Too many non-native-English-speakers play parts of native-English-speakers, reading out lines from a script that should have been thrown away and not having been made into a movie. It's unbelievable how unbelievable all the lines in the movie sound. The music is awful and totally out of place, and the whole thing looks and sounds like a poor school play.<br /><br />I recommend you watch it just so you would appreciate other, better, movies. This is why I gave it a 3 instead of the 1 it deserves.",
    "I saw this DVD in my friends house and thought that this was a Turkish action movie with some Hollywood-not very big-names in it. Interested enough I decide to give it a shot later.. It was a tough to bear experience believe me. Then, after finally seeing the credits roll I tought 'We Turks really suck at Hollywood style film making.. This is an insult to the heist|hostage movie genre..' but then wait! I checked some names and no, they were not Turkish names and no, this was not a Turkish movie; on the contrary it was literally shot in America with an American director & crew! That made me thinking-again!- How on earth can you persuade names like Micheal Madsen, Edward Furlong or even Arnold Vosloo to take part in such a project? with money probably.. That kept me thinking further.. How can you raise such amount of money to offer them and a supposedly international cast? Then all my meditation paid off and I came to find the answer.By hiring the cheapest equipment and crew that you can find. And if you still have to difficulty in adjustin your budget then: by writing and directing the movie you are trying to produce-or vice versa I don't have any information on that-. So bottom line this is not a bad movie as everybody are so anxious to present as.. It makes you think -in my case even meditate- and there are a lot of movies outthere that doesn't give even that affect.. This one at least makes you think; It makes you wonder.. It leaves you with disbelief.. and then It makes you wonder again..",
    "What was with all the Turkish actors? No offense but I thought it was all for nothing for all these actors. The film had no script to test any actors acting skill or ability. It demanded next to nothing I bought this film to see Michael Madsen. He is one of my favorite actors but this film was another failure for him. The script was so bad. Their was just nothing to sink your teeth into and all the characters were two dimensional. Madsen tried to act like a hard ass but the script and direction didn't even allow him to do enough with his character to make it more interesting or 3 dimensional.<br /><br />Even the sound effects of the gunfight at the beginning of the film sounded like the noise of paint ball guns when they are fired in a skirmish. It was really weird and they didn't sound like real guns. A video game had better sound effects than this film. There was also a really annoying bloke at the beginning of the film who was a member of the robbery gang. He had this American whining voice like a girl shouting lines like \"Lets get the F#$k out of here\" and What are we going to do man\". He sounded like a girl. As a positive It was funny to watch and it made me laugh too. For a few seconds. Whoo Hoo ! Dumb Film. Poor Madsen. He will bounce back...",
    "This movie was terrible. at first i just read the plot summary and it looked OK, so i watched it. The acting was TERRIBLE. it was like the actor were almost camera shy. everything seemed fake. i feel bad for Edward Furlong, terminator 2 was my favorite a few years ago.. I've watched it at least 20 times....<br /><br />the plot was also crap. the writers were probably sleep deprived when they came up with the lines.<br /><br />on the plus side, it's the good kind of bad movie. the one you keep watching just to see how much worst could it will get, so that later you can tell other people how you couldn't believe how terrible the movie was.<br /><br />i think everybody should watch this, so that then we could appreciate better other, REAL, movies.",
    "I am a big fan of Arnold Vosloo. Finally seeing him as the star of a recent movie, not just a bit part, made me happy.<br /><br />Unfortunately I took film appreciation in college and the only thing I can say that I didn't like was that the film was made in an abandoned part of town and there was no background traffic or lookie loos.<br /><br />I have to say that the acting leaves something to be desired, but Arnold is an excellent actor, I have to chalk it up to lousy direction and the supporting cast leaves something to be desired.<br /><br />I love Arnold Vosloo, and he made the film viewable. Otherwise, I would have written it off as another lousy film.<br /><br />I found the rape scene brutal and unnecessary, but the actors that got away at the end were pretty good. But the sound effects of the shoot-out were pretty bad. There are some glitches in the film (continuity) but they are overlookable considering the low-caliber of the film.<br /><br />All in all I enjoyed the film, because Arnold Vosloo was in it.<br /><br />Jackie",
    "This is an art film that was either made in 1969 or 1972 (the National Film Preservation Foundation says 1969 and IMDb says 1972). Regardless of the exact date, the film definitely appears to be very indicative of this general time period--with some camera-work and pop art stylings that are pure late 60s-early 70s.<br /><br />The film consists of three simple images that are distorted using different weird camera tricks. These distorted images are accompanied by music and there is absolutely no dialog or plot of any sort. This was obviously intended as almost like a form of performance art, and like most performance art, it's interesting at first but quickly becomes tiresome. The film, to put it even more bluntly, is a total bore and would appeal to no one but perhaps those who made the film, their family and friends and perhaps a few people just too hip and \"with it\" to be understood by us mortals.",
    "Nine minutes of psychedelic, pulsating, often symmetric abstract images, are enough to drive anyone crazy. I did spot a full-frame eye at the start, and later some birds silhouetted against other colors. It was just not my cup of tea. It's about 8½ minutes too long.",
    "There are lots of extremely good-looking people in this movie. That's probably the best thing about it. Perhaps that even makes it worth watching.<br /><br />\"Loaded\" tells the story of Tristan Price (Jesse Metcalfe), a young man who's about to make his mark on the world. He's the son of a well-to-do family with a good reputation, and he's on his way to law school. But like so many such settings, things aren't quite as perfect as they appear. The expectations in this family far outweigh the love. Except for school, Tristan's father rarely lets him leave the house. This seems to be the result of some past traumatic event that shook the family, which is partially revealed through flashbacks but isn't spelled out until the very end. Tristan's claustrophobic environment causes him to let loose in very extreme ways at the first possible opportunity, when his friends take him out to a strip club to celebrate his graduation. The celebration soon follows some strippers back to a beach house party, and from there, Tristan befriends Sebastian Cole (Corey Large), who pulls him into a drug dealing underworld.<br /><br />While technically well-made, this movie suffers from a lackluster script and a storyline that isn't very engaging. Also counting against this film are some constant camera tricks that generally seemed annoying and out-of-place, such as slow-motion, fast-motion, freeze-frames and echos. These are the types of effects a director might normally utilize to show a character's perspective while on drugs, except in this case they seem to have been sporadically tossed in at random points, in some cheap attempt at style.<br /><br />Despite its cast of relative unknowns, performances were good all around, most notably with respect to the main antagonist (Corey Large). I suspect we'll be seeing at least a couple of these people in bigger and better projects in the future.<br /><br />Of course, when mentioning the actors, I must mention their looks. Rating based on hotness, this movies scores an 11. The women in this movie are incredible-looking and almost distract you from what a boring movie you're watching. I'm sure the male characters are also quite attractive, but you'll have to ask someone else to comment on that.<br /><br />Overall, I can't recommend this movie, not for buying, renting, or even seeing for free. It's unfortunately just not worth the effort it takes to sit through.",
    "This is it. This is the one. This is the worst movie ever made. Ever. It beats everything. I have never seen worse. Retire the trophy and give it to these people.....there's just no comparison.<br /><br />Even three days after watching this (for some reason I still don't know why) I cannot believe how insanely horrific this movie is/was. Its so bad. So far from anything that could be considered a movie, a story or anything that should have ever been created and brought into our existence.<br /><br />This made me question whether or not humans are truly put on this earth to do good. It made me feel disgusted with ourselves and our progress as a species in this universe. This type of movie sincerely hurts us as a society. We should be ashamed. I really cannot emphasize that our global responsibility as people living here and creating art, is that we need to prevent the creation of these gross distortions of our reality for our own good. It's an embarrassment. I don't know how on earth any of these actors, writers, or the director of this film sleeps at night knowing that they had a role in making \"Loaded\". I don't know what type of disgusting monsters enjoy watching these types of movies.<br /><br />That being said, I love a good \"bad\" movie. I love Shark Attack 3, I love Bad Taste, they are HILARIOUS. I tell all my friends to see them because they are \"bad\".<br /><br />But this.......this crosses the line of \"bad\" into a whole new dimension. This is awkward bad. This is the bad where you know everything that is going to happen, every line, every action, every death, every sequence BEFORE they happen; and not just like a second or two before, I mean like, after watching the first 5 minutes before.<br /><br />Every cheesy editing \"effect\" is shamelessly used over and over again to a sickening point. I really never want to see the \"shaky\" camera \"drug buzz rush\" effect or jump cuts or swerve cuts or ANY FANCY CUT EVER AGAIN EVER. This is meticulously boring, repetitive and just tortures the audience.<br /><br />But.......and let me be specific here, the most DISTURBING thing about this movie is that given the production, it appears that a somewhat decent amount of money was actually put into this excrement. I personally will grab the shoulders of the director if I ever see him and shake him into submission, demanding that he run home and swallow two-gallons of Drain-O or I will do it for him.<br /><br />If we ever needed a new form of inhumane torture for our war prisoners abroad, just keep showing them this movie in a padded cell over and over again. Trust me, I think they will become more extravagant with suicide methods after the 72nd time of sitting through this.<br /><br />Stop these movies, they are just the most vile of all facets of our society. Please. Stop. NOW.",
    "There are times when finishing a film one wishes to have a refund for the time just spent. This was one of those times. I almost gave up with only 15 minutes left to endure... and I wish I had...<br /><br />The pace that a man goes from a straight-laced, controlled life to one of complete spinelessness and irresponsibility could never be this rapid.<br /><br />From a graduation celebration to the predictable ending Tristan Price (Jesse Metcalfe) man of privilege and culture allows himself to be seduced by a woman, by violence, and by mind altering substances. Of course, the woman part is understandable when observing the talents of the beautiful April (Nathalie Kelley). But the in for a penny in for a pound aspect of the drugs, violence and dedication to a person he has just met is impossible to understand.<br /><br />Frankly, besides being able to stare at Nathalie Kelley and Monica Keena, this film has no redeeming qualities. Save your money, save your time... do anything else...",
    "Weak plot, predictable violence, only semi interesting characters. Like the writer (also one of the stars?) was fictionalizing his own screw ups and added an incredulous fantasies of drugs and murder to make it \"hot\". From the predictable rap and house soundtrack, to the family conflicts, it's poorly acted, stereotypical, and ultimately terribly boring. Even the title has been done before - IMDb lists FIVE movies with the same name released in 2007-2008!! <br /><br />Note: Saw it on Showtime, which listed the synopsis for one of the other movies. Was halfway thru before I realized no one was an undercover cop. Even tho another stereotype, would have made it interesting if it happened.",
    "All I could think of while watching this movie was B-grade slop. Many have spoken about it's redeeming quality is how this film portrays such a realistic representation of the effects of drugs and an individual and their subsequent spiral into a self perpetuation state of unfortunate events. Yet really, the techniques used (as many have already mentioned) were overused and thus unconvincing and irrelevant to the film as a whole.<br /><br />As far as the plot is concerned, it was lacklustre, unimaginative, implausible and convoluted. You can read most other reports on this film and they will say pretty much the same as I would.<br /><br />Granted some of the actors and actresses are attractive but when confronted with such boring action... looks can only carry a film so far. The action is poor and intermittent: a few punches thrown here and there, and a final gunfight towards the end. Nothing really to write home about.<br /><br />As others have said, 'BAD' movies are great to watch for the very reason that they are 'bad', you revel in that fact. This film, however, is a void. It's nothing.<br /><br />Furthermore, if one is really in need of an educational movie to scare people away from drug use then I would seriously recommend any number of other movies out there that board such issues in a much more effective way. 'Requiem For A Dream', 'Trainspotting', 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' and 'Candy' are just a few examples. Though one should also check out some more lighthearted films on the same subject like 'Go' (overall, both serious and funny) and 'Halfbaked'.<br /><br />On a final note, the one possibly redeeming line in this movie, delivered by Vinnie Jones was stolen from 'Lock, Stock and Two Smokling Barrels'. To think that a bit of that great movie has been tainted by 'Loaded' is vile.<br /><br />Overall, I strongly suggest that you save you money and your time by NOT seeing this movie.",
    "If you look at Corey Large's information here on IMDb, apparently there's a movie called \"Reload\" in production (as of June '08) in which he's playing a character named Sebastian Cole.<br /><br />First of all, how does such a crappy movie ever earn a sequel ... and second, didn't Sebastian get killed at the end of \"Loaded\"?<br /><br />I watched this in the wee hours of the morning when I was battling insomnia, and so I was drifting in and out while it was on. I'm sure I missed some plot points, but overall, it seemed really weak. Large's performance was (for me) one of the stronger parts of the film. I'm also a bit surprised at all the people commenting on the beautiful girls, since I thought the actress playing Brooke was pretty, but not exceptional.",
    "This film had a lot of promise, and the plot was relatively interesting, however the actors, director and editors seriously let this film down.<br /><br />I feel bad for the writers, it could have been good. The acting is wooden, very few of the characters are believable.<br /><br />Who ever edited this clearly just learnt some new edit techniques and wanted to splash them all over the film. There are lots of quick 'flashy' edits in almost every scene, which are clearly meant to be symbolic but just end up as annoying.<br /><br />I wanted to like this film and expected there to be a decent resolution to the breakdown of equilibrium but alas no, it left me feeling like I'd wasted my time and the film makers had wasted their money.",
    "This is one of the dumbest films, I've ever seen. It rips off nearly ever type of thriller and manages to make a mess of them all.<br /><br />There's not a single good line or character in the whole mess. If there was a plot, it was an afterthought and as far as acting goes, there's nothing good to say so Ill say nothing. I honestly cant understand how this type of nonsense gets produced and actually released, does somebody somewhere not at some stage think, 'Oh my god this really is a load of shite' and call it a day. Its crap like this that has people downloading illegally, the trailer looks like a completely different film, at least if you have download it, you haven't wasted your time or money Don't waste your time, this is painful.",
    "6/10 Acting, not great but some good acting.<br /><br />4/10 Director, makes some stupid decisions for this film.<br /><br />2/10 Writer, story makes no sense at all and has huge amount of flaws.<br /><br />4/10 Overall score for this movie.<br /><br />Don't waste your time with this film, it's not worth it. I gave 4 for this movie and it may be too much. Characters are so over exaggerated than they can ever be in real life and some pretty unexplainable stuff happens \"storywise\", not in good way. Because of the style this film has been filmed you get bored after 30 minutes (too many special effects: slow motions and camera shakes and fast forwards). It's always good that movie uses music to make the story go smooth but there's too many tracks in this one. In the first hour there is almost 50/50 dialogs and musics",
    "This is really a new low in entertainment. Even though there are a lot worse movies out.<br /><br />In the Gangster / Drug scene genre it is hard to have a convincing storyline (this movies does not, i mean Sebastians motives for example couldn't be more far fetched and worn out cliché.) Then you would also need a setting of character relationships that is believable (this movie does not.) <br /><br />Sure Tristan is drawn away from his family but why was that again? what's the deal with his father again that he has to ask permission to go out at his age? interesting picture though to ask about the lack and need of rebellious behavior of kids in upper class family. But this movie does not go in this direction. Even though there would be the potential judging by the random Backflashes. Wasn't he already down and out, why does he do it again? <br /><br />So there are some interesting questions brought up here for a solid socially critic drama (but then again, this movie is just not, because of focusing on \"cool\" production techniques and special effects an not giving the characters a moment to reflect and most of all forcing the story along the path where they want it to be and not paying attention to let the story breath and naturally evolve.) <br /><br />It wants to be a drama to not glorify abuse of substances and violence (would be political incorrect these days, wouldn't it?) but on the other hand it is nothing more then a cheap action movie (like there are so so many out there) with an average set of actors and a Vinnie Jones who is managing to not totally ruin what's left of his reputation by doing what he always does.<br /><br />So all in all i .. just ... can't recommend it.<br /><br />1 for Vinnie and 2 for the editing.",
    "From the beginning of the movie, it gives the feeling the director is trying to portray something, what I mean to say that instead of the story dictating the style in which the movie should be made, he has gone in the opposite way, he had a type of move that he wanted to make, and wrote a story to suite it. And he has failed in it very badly. I guess he was trying to make a stylish movie. Any way I think this movie is a total waste of time and effort. In the credit of the director, he knows the media that he is working with, what I am trying to say is I have seen worst movies than this. Here at least the director knows to maintain the continuity in the movie. And the actors also have given a decent performance.",
    "I basically skimmed through the movie but just enough to catch watch the plot was about. To tell you the truth it was kind of boring to me and at some spots it didn't make sense. The only reason I watched this movie in the first place was to see CHACE CRAWFORD!!! He is so hot, but in this movie his hair was kind of weird. But still hot.<br /><br />However, despite how hot CHACE is, it really did not make up for the film. I guess the plot isn't that bad but what really threw me over was the fact that they cuss in like every sentence. Is it that hard to express your anger without saying the F word every time?The cussing was annoying and the whole flashy, camera shaking thing gave me a headache.<br /><br />All in all, although the plot was OK, I found the film to be a bore and over dramatic. That's why I only cut to scenes with CHACE in it. LOL Anyways, not worth renting unless your a die-hard fan of a specific cast member like I was. Oh yeah the cast was Hot. The girls were HOT!!! But CHACE IS THE BEST!!",
    "This fanciful horror flick has Vincent Price playing a mad magician that realizes his vocational talents have been sold to another. He devise ways of avenging all those that have wronged him. His master scheme seems to back fire on him.<br /><br />Price is a little below par compared to his masterpieces, but is still the only reason to watch this thriller. Supporting cast includes Patrick O'Neal, Mary Murphy, Eva Gabor and Jay Novello.<br /><br />",
    "If I had not read Pat Barker's 'Union Street' before seeing this film, I would have liked it. Unfortuntately this is not the case. It is actually my kind of film, it is well made, and in no way do I want to say otherwise, but as an adaptation, it fails from every angle.<br /><br />The harrowing novel about the reality of living in a northern England working-class area grabbed hold of my heartstrings and refused to let go for weeks after I had finished. I was put through tears, repulsion, shock, anger, sympathy and misery when reading about the women of Union Street. Excellent. A novel that at times I felt I could not read any more of, but I novel I simply couldn't put down. Depressing yes, but utterly gripping.<br /><br />The film. Oh dear. Hollywood took Barker's truth and reality, and showered a layer of sweet icing sugar over the top of it. A beautiful film, an inspiring soundtrack, excellent performances, a tale of hope and romance...yes. An adaptation of 'Union Street'...no.<br /><br />The women of Union Street and their stories are condensed into Fonda's character, their stories are touched on, but many are discarded. I accept that some of Barker's tales are sensitive issues and are too horrific for mass viewing, and that a film with around 7 leading protagonists just isn't practical, but the content is not my main issue. The essence and the real gut of the novel is lost - darkness and rain, broken windows covered with cardboard, and the graphically described stench of poverty is replaced with sunshine, pretty houses, and a twinkling William's score.<br /><br />If you enjoyed the film for its positivity and hope in the face of 'reality', I advise that you hesitate to read the book without first preparing yourself for something more like 'Schindler's List'...but without the happy ending.",
    "I saw the capsule comment said \"great acting.\" In my opinion, these are two great actors giving horrible performances, and with zero chemistry with one another, for a great director in his all-time worst effort. Robert De Niro has to be the most ingenious and insightful illiterate of all time. Jane Fonda's performance uncomfortably drifts all over the map as she clearly has no handle on this character, mostly because the character is so poorly written. Molasses-like would be too swift an adjective for this film's excruciating pacing. Although the film's intent is to be an uplifting story of curing illiteracy, watching it is a true \"bummer.\" I give it 1 out of 10, truly one of the worst 20 movies for its budget level that I have ever seen.",
    "Robert DeNiro plays the most unbelievably intelligent illiterate of all time. This movie is so wasteful of talent, it is truly disgusting. The script is unbelievable. The dialog is unbelievable. Jane Fonda's character is a caricature of herself, and not a funny one. The movie moves at a snail's pace, is photographed in an ill-advised manner, and is insufferably preachy. It also plugs in every cliche in the book. Swoozie Kurtz is excellent in a supporting role, but so what?<br /><br />Equally annoying is this new IMDB rule of requiring ten lines for every review. When a movie is this worthless, it doesn't require ten lines of text to let other readers know that it is a waste of time and tape. Avoid this movie.",
    "Story of a man who has unnatural feelings for a pig. Starts out with a opening scene that is a terrific example of absurd comedy. A formal orchestra audience is turned into an insane, violent mob by the crazy chantings of it's singers. Unfortunately it stays absurd the WHOLE time with no general narrative eventually making it just too off putting. Even those from the era should be turned off. The cryptic dialogue would make Shakespeare seem easy to a third grader. On a technical level it's better than you might think with some good cinematography by future great Vilmos Zsigmond. Future stars Sally Kirkland and Frederic Forrest can be seen briefly.",
    "Ah, Bait. How do I hate thee? Let me count the ways. 1. You try to be funny, but are corny and unenjoyable; every joke is predictable and expected, and when it comes, does not inspire laughter. Instead, I want to hurl. 2. You try to be dramatic, but are unbelievable; the woman overacts to a terrible degree, and the \"bad guy\" looks like Bill Gates, and is about as scary as...well, Bill Gates. (Just try to imagine Bill Gates trying to intimidate somebody with a gun. Doesn't work, does it? A lawyer, maybe, but not a gun. Doesn't fit.) As for Jamie Foxx, well, just watching him try to deliver a dramatic and heartfelt dialogue is ludicrous, and makes me want to hurl. 3. You try to be action-packed, but instead are dull and dragging too many times. And when the action heats up, the tripod for the camera must have been lost, for the scenes wobble more than those in The Blair Witch Project, and I find myself nauseated, and once again I want to hurl. 4. You try to be a good movie, but you failed, you FAILED, YOU FAILED! I would rather walk barefoot across the Sahara with a pack full of beef jerky and no water, no sunscreen, and only Meryl Streep for company. This hell would be lovelier than a single minute more spent watching everyone in Bait overact their way through an idiotically written story with Bill Gates for a bad guy, and let's not even talk about the massive bomb that goes off in a car that Jamie Foxx's character has just driven OFF A CLIFF, but somehow manages to escape...just kill me now, or do the right thing and promise me that somehow I'll never have to watch a movie that is this bad, ever again.",
    "The premise of the movie has been explained and if you've gotten this far you don't me to pretend that I'm a movie critic. With that being said my own opinion of the movie is quite low. I'm a fan of Takashi Miike but this goes down in the category of his not so great work along with DOA 2 and 3, and some others (many).<br /><br />The movie seems to get a free pass because it is a Takashi film and nothing Takashi does can be wrong. This is a highschoolers approach to cinema. For the rest of us we'll find and hour and a half of a kid screaming for no real reason completely annoying (and yes, this does take away from the film), the pace of the film almost reaching levels of rigomortis, and the acting...well...hmmm. <br /><br />If one is a Takashi fan you'll see it regardless to peak your interests. It lacks any originality (see the Neverending Story) or any character development from the lead character in the face of conflict other then a quite superficial one. <br /><br />As it has been pointed out this is the first film Miike has been credited with co-writing, but that doesn't mean much as non of what we'd hope would be Miike's personality would spill over into the screen. All we get are some of the token Miike shots vis the director of photography.<br /><br />The movie had the potential to be something great. The premise is not a difficult one to run wild with. But this one seemed to have been run into the ground.<br /><br />My suggestion is if you're just getting into Miike is go with some of the standards like Gozu, Ichi, and Audition. Then movie into his works like Blue's Harp, Fudoh, Rainy Dog, Bird People of China.",
    "Uninspired direction leaves a decent cast stranded in a handsome but bland adaptation, in which dialogue seems recited rather than heartfelt, and cash strapped appearances by the ghosts fail to round up any sense of awe or magic; Edward Woodward, as the Ghost of Christmas Present, wobbles around on stilts and seems to be doing an impression of Bernard Cribbins. As Scrooge, George C. Scott is too wry, and he never seems to truly believe in it, which robs his performance of its effect. The scenes in which he's shown his past have as much impact as if he was half-heartedly flicking through his family album. No one else seems to be putting any effort in, except Frank Finlay, who chronically overacts.",
    "I was sooooo excited to see this movie after finally reading the book this week. My 13 year old son was looking forward to it too. I rented it and snuggled down to enjoy a classic holiday story brought to life on screen.<br /><br />Boy, was I disappointed. This movie veered off from the book more times than is forgivable. George C. Scott is an excellent actor but in this, it seemed that he was fully into character only about 20% of the time. The rest of the time he was quite flat.<br /><br />I realize that this was made in '84, pre-CG effects, for the most part. But it looked to be very B-movie quality, especially the encounter with Jacob Marley.<br /><br />The biggest disappointment was the fact that they left out one of the most moving parts of the story: When the Spirit of Christmas Present takes Scrooge on the whirlwind tour of the world, observing people in the bleakest of circumstances still having the light and love of Christmastime.<br /><br />I will admit that Mr. Scott did a good job with the \"reformed\" Scrooge at the end. That was a refreshing portrayal.<br /><br />I wish that Bob Cratchit had been portrayed as a little more ragged and down-trodden. And Tiny Tim... oh don't even get me started on bad child actors...",
    "Having seen three other versions of the same film, I am afraid for me this is by far the weakest, primarily due to Scott's rather dull and leaden performance. His emotions throughout are so bland it makes it difficult to engage in the film. Alistair Sim portrayed the role infinitely better. When Scrooge was at his meanest, you don't get the sense Scott is saying the dialogue with much conviction and when he undergoes his metamorphosis he is similarly unconvincing. I cannot think of any actors in this film who match those from the Alistair Sim version. Even the musical version (and frankly the Muppets) take on this are better executed. Very disappointing.",
    "Saw this movie in my English class this afternoon and was surprised by how bad this version was. Don't get me wrong, George C. Scott was terrific as Scrooge, but the rest of the cast fails so very badly. Sometimes I couldn't stop laughing at the stupid acting and the repeated line: \"Merry Christmas to everyone!\" Other times I almost fell asleep.<br /><br />The movie is based on a Charles Dickens short story about a rich guy, who don't think Christmas is nothing but humbug. After 30 minutes, the rich guy is visited by three ghosts, who persuade him to celebrate Christmas after all.<br /><br />I can not understand how this movie, with a script so bad it must have been written in five minutes, can be so well-rated. Instead of this piece of garbage, I recommend to you, the Bill Murray comedy Scrooged. That at least, was funny...",
    "When will the hurting stop? I never want to see another version of a Christmas Carol again. They keep on making movies with the same story, falling over each other in trying to make the movie better then the rest, but sadly fail to do so, as this is not a good story. Moralistic, old-fashioned, conservative happy-thinking. As if people learn. The numerous different versions of this film prove that we don´t.",
    "It was 9:30 PM last night at my friend's camping trailer and we were so hyped to watch South Park (a new episode). The thing is, in my country, South Park airs at 10:30 PM and we decided to kill time by watching the show now airing, Father of the Pride. I'll start by saying that I have only watched to episodes. The first time I watched it, I found it unfunny and crude for nothing, so I thought ''Holy sh*t, I have a football game early tomorrow, so I have to stop watching stupid cartoons''. But yesterday, I tried to give Father of the Pride a second chance. I find that it's a complete rip-off of The Simpsons, only replacing yellow human characters by lions instead.<br /><br />The second thing is I wonder why it got it's TV-14 rating. I find The Simpsons a lot more vulgar, and the only real vulgarity in this show is a few homosexual (unfunny) jokes. The Simpsons is also a lot more violent (Halloween specials) and crude. I also heard that the creator of the series has also directed Shrek 2, well I've got news for him: Shrek 2 was way better and I think he stayed too much in the family thematic. However, I must admit that Father of the Pride did make me smile (even burst out laughing once) three or four times.<br /><br />All in all, I don't mind Father of the Pride. I don't hate it, but I don't like either. I've seen way better from ''The Simpsons''.<br /><br />3.5/10",
    "This is blatantly a futuristic adaptation of Jules Verne's \"Mysterious Island\". The sound editing is pretty bad. You hear the dialogue on set and you hear the voices being recorded on a recording booth at the same time! This is an amateur film with actors from Boston and shot around New Hampshire. For those living in New Engalnd and who is reading this comment will be wowed with a capital W. This film is full of flaws. You get to hear the director's voice giving directions and giving out directions to the actress. \"OK now stand up.\" As for the other characters. There is this guy who talks with his mind instead of his voice and this blue alien. The alien guy talks with a deep voice. When he is yawning or grunting when he is fighting you hear the actor's voice. As for the special effects, man! This was Brett Piper's early work for crying out loud! The creatures are good but the animation is jerky. Really jerky. Sort of like Karl Zeman animation in JOURNEY TO BEGINNING OF TIME (1955). The special effects are imaginative. Thge music is good. Bottom line, this film makes EQUINOX or PLANET OF THE DINOSAURS look like a Ray Harryhausen epic. Did you know MYSTERIOUS PLANET was a home movie and was on a shoes string budget? A must watch for aspiring film makers.",
    "Beyond a shadow of a doubt Mysterious Planet is one of the worst movies ever made, yet retains an affection in my heart because the poverty of its special effects and astoundingly awful sound track in the first 15 minutes (and to be honest that's all you need to see) combine to create something that is hilariously side-splitting.<br /><br />The opening scene in 'space' is just about as unfathomable as cinematography gets, as washing-up liquid bottles whiz past your eyes to muffled dialogue. Before you've had time to work out whether it's you who's gone mad, the credits roll and the action struggles to life.<br /><br />And aside from the double-headed plasticine giant snail that terrorises our heroes, you also get the added double bonus of having both the original actors voices AND the dubbed voices at the same time. Pure genius.<br /><br />The sad thing for fans of this kind of fare is that I've only ever seen one copy, so the chances of ever seeing it yourself is highly unlikely. Perhaps I own the only copy in existence.<br /><br />",
    "The silent one-panel cartoon Henry comes to Fleischer Studios, billed as \"The world's funniest human\" in this dull little cartoon. Betty, long past her prime, thanks to the Production Code, is running a pet shop and leaves Henry in charge for far too long -- five minutes. A bore.",
    "William Russ is the main character throughout this made for TV movie. He left his family behind to only reappear and begin paying off his debts. But he tries to keep away from his family. Thats where Peter Falk (Colombo) comes in, playing several different roles, to convince him to come home.<br /><br />The story is average and they actually managed to get a former star (Peter Falk) and use him to a fairly nice degree. But William Russ wasn't truly a star. However, it appears his acting is still OK.<br /><br />I found the delivery and story very cheesy in how everything was predictable. In fact, the last 20 minutes I could almost dictate word for word before it happened. A good movie should never be like that.<br /><br />Overall, it was a sub-par movie. In a letter grading system, it would receive a \"D\".",
    "From a poorly contrived plot line that makes almost no sense to bad dialogue and disjointed scenes to the ultimate downer, bad acting (even Peter Falk can't find his way) \"Finding John Christmas\" is better left lost. Ms. Bertinelli's performance is without depth or emotion as are her co-stars, William Russ as brother Hank and David Cubitt as love interest Noah. Jennifer Pisana as Soccoro, the daughter of single dad Noah is almost unbearable to watch let alone listen to singing. But who can blame them with material like this. Michael J. Murray's script is juvenile at best. <br /><br />Each year at this time I search the TV guides and wait anxiously for some of the really classic Christmas and inspirational holiday films to appear on the small screen. Films like \"Miracle on 34th Street\", Ernst Lubitsch's delightful \"The shop around the corner\" and, of course the 1951 version of \"Scrooge\". There's Frank Capra's classics \"It's a wonderful life\" and \"Meet John Doe\". Hey, forget the classics. What about \"Home Alone\" or \" Home for the Holidays\" with Holly Hunter and a great performance by Robert Downey Jr.? <br /><br />My present to you is by way of advice. Your time would be better spent searching out these films than finding \"Finding John Christmas\". Merry Christmas!",
    "I never like to comment on a good film but when it comes to a bad movie, I gotta come really hard on it. Talking about Vivah, this guy, Sooraj Badjatya, seems to have completely lost it. After success of Hum Aapke Hain Kaun, he thought he can make money with cheesy wedding videos. Vivah is so so cheesy that Badjatyas have left Johars and Chopras behind.<br /><br />There was not a single moment during the movie where I can say 'Oh! at least this thing is good'. Aloknath does cliché in a role of Girl's father, Shahid kapoor looks fat and Shahrukhed, Amrita rao is another disaster in addition to ugly looking sets, bad costumes, hackneyed storyline, monstrous stepmother, trying-hard-to-act actors, cacophonous background music, cheap soundtracks.<br /><br />Now the spoiler, I'm warning you guys that as happens in all his other movies, after a calamitous incidence movie ends on a happy note.",
    "I won't say this movie was bad, but it wasn't good either. I expected something good but I guess Hum Aapke Hain Kaun was much better than this. This was completely old fashioned. At every stage of this movie, I hoped for some twist and what do I get? The girl gets burned and wins her aunt's love. <br /><br />Despite of being engaged, they have to take permission for every little move they make. They are so darn shy even after so many meetings. I expected the aunt to be much more brutal than that. All she did was crib madly. <br /><br />Hey, we have kids too, but we don't watch them and have tears in our eyes always. This movie is a dream. Happy family, one cruel woman, good in-laws and a man who loves her to death. In HAHK Anupam Kher was the poor bride's father and now it's vice versa. And I somehow knew that Mohnish Behl would be in this movie. Anyway I believe I wasted my time. I give it a 2/10.",

Wake up people!<br /><br />Four out of the five people that saw the film with me would not recommend the film. We had a great time bashing majority of the unrealistic scenes.

I was hugely disappointed. It is a script reading not a film, vulgar for the sake of being vulgar, bankrupt in every way that \"The Tailor of Panama\" is rich and satisfying. Blame it on the screen writing and directing. I sat in the theater waiting for the \"good part;\" it never came. I neither laughed nor cried, although one line of dialog did make me smile. Worth $7?

    "I very nearly walked out, but I'd paid my money, and my nearly-as-disgusted friend wanted to hold out. After the endearing, wide-eyed innocence of \"A New Hope\" and the thrilling sophistication of \"The Empire Strikes Back,\" I remember awaiting \"Return of the Jedi\" with almost aching anticipation. But from the opening scene of this insultingly commercial sewage, I was bitterly disappointed, and enraged at Lucas. He should have been ashamed of himself, but this abomination undeniably proves that he doesn't have subatomic particle of shame in his cold, greedy heart. Episode I would go on to reinforce this fact -- your honor, I call Jarjar Binks (but please issue barf bags to the members of the jury first).<br /><br />From the initial raising of the gate at Jabba's lair, this \"film\" was nothing more than a two-plus-hour commercial for as many licensable, profit-making action figures as Lucas could cram into it -- the pig-like guards, the hokey flesh-pigtailed flunky, that vile muppet-pet of Jabba's, the new and recycled cabaret figures, the monsters, etc., etc., ad vomitum. Then there were the detestably cute and marketable Ewoks. Pile on top of that all of the rebel alliance aliens. Fifteen seconds each on-screen (or less) and the kiddies just GOTTA have one for their collection. The blatant, exploitative financial baiting of children is nauseating.<br /><br />Lucas didn't even bother to come up with a new plot -- he just exhumed the Death Star from \"A New Hope\" and heaved in a boatload of cheap sentiment. What an appalling slap in the face to his fans. I can't shake the notion that Lucas took a perverse pleasure in inflicting this dreck on his fans: \"I've got these lemmings hooked so bad that I can crank out the worst piece of stinking, putrid garbage that I could dream up, and they'll flock to the theaters to scarf it up. Plus, all the kiddies will whine and torture their parents until they buy the brats a complete collection of action figures of every single incidental undeveloped, cartoonish caricature that I stuffed in, and I get a cut from every single one. It'll make me even more obscenely rich.\"<br /><br />There may have been a paltry, partial handful of redeeming moments in this miserable rip-off. I seem to recall that Harrison Ford managed to just barely keep his nose above the surface of this cesspool. But whatever tiny few bright spots there may be are massively obliterated by the offensive commercialism that Lucas so avariciously embraced in this total, absolute sell-out to profit.",
    "The fine cast cannot uplift this routine tale of a secretary murdered by her married paramour. In fact there are more questions than answers in this one-sided tale of romance and murder; and since we are only provided with the prosecution's side, none of these questions will be answered. This is the type of fare that appeals to the \"He Woman, Man Hater\" clubs of America. As presented, it is the tale of an innocent woman who just happens to be \"caught up\" in a romance with a married, high-profile attorney. Is it possible that IF, she had not been two timing her boy friend and having an affair with a married man, the whole nasty murderous, sordid incident could have been avoided? When you watch this, don't worry about going to the 'fridge, you won't miss anything.",
    "This film was choppy, incoherent and contrived. It was also an extremely mean-spirited portrayal of women. I rented it because it was listed as a comedy (that's a stretch), and because the cover said Andie McDowell was acting up a storm in it. She wasn't. I'm a gal, I watched this film with two guys, and we spent an hour afterwards exclaiming over how bad it was.<br /><br />WARNING: PLOT SUMMARY BELOW! RAMPANT SPOILERS!<br /><br />The movie starts out with a fairly hackneyed plot about an older woman who takes up with a younger man, to the severe disapproval of her two jealous single girlfriends. They want her to marry a boring guy their own age who is kind of in love with her. But she's so happy with her oversexed puppy that you're rooting for them to stick it out, and sure enough, she decides to marry the guy. But her harpy girlfriend, aided by the wishy-washy one, sets up a plot to trick our heroine into thinking the guy is cheating on her. It works. She has a fight with him, he runs out of the house and is crushed by a truck (Remember the movie's title?) So now he's dead, two-thirds of the way through the film. And although our heroine is a school headmistress who spends her time watching over girls, she apparently forgot to use birth control and is pregnant.<br /><br />She's already broken off relations with her girlfriends, because they were so unsupportive. Alone and pitiful, she decides to marry the boring guy. Did I mention that the boring guy who kind of loves her is a minister? She had asked him to marry her to the young guy (nice, huh?), but now she tells him she'll marry him, and apparently he has no objections to being dicked around in this fashion. But her girlfriends rescue her at the altar and take her home, where they not-quite-confess that they were mostly responsible for the love of her life getting smushed. She has the kid. In the final scene, they leave it in a crib inside her house while they go out on the porch to drink, smoke and be smug. I kid you not, it's that bad. I left out the part about the cancer red-herring and the harpy's ridiculous lesbian moment.",
    "This film is a calculated attempt to cash in the success of Sex in the City and Four Weddings and a Funeral. In fact, if they'd called it Sex at a Funeral, they might have done better at the box office.<br /><br />But the film falls between two stools and can't get up. The characters spout improbably bright dialog, but never act in any way remotely recognizable as human. One arbitrary, senseless action follows another to advance what passes for a plot, and one soon tires of the falsity of the whole enterprise.<br /><br />Andie MacDowell gets points for acting her little heart out, but the performing honors are stolen by Imelda Staunton, as of all things, a police detective (don't they have a height requirement over there?). Ms. Staunton seems unable to make a false move. Would that we could say the same about the writer-director.<br /><br />If Notting Hill annoyed you as being bogus, stay away from this one. Phonus bolognus on the half-shell.",
    "This had to be one of the worst films ever. When Kate shows up and Jed is with a bunch of guys and they all start clapping...so Hollywood. Another bad scene was when Kate was running her hands over the pavement it appeared that she was examining the texture of the pavement. Andie's acting is so bad in this film - I could not connect with them or feel there love for each other. The other 2 women however were very good and overshadowed Andie. Anyway this was such a campy movie. I usually like these type of films but I just couldn't get into this film. Too many unlikely situations and again Andie's acting didn't help the film. Also, she is all gums. Lancome must put her makeup on with a putty knife because she looks glamorous in the commericals.",
    "This starts off bad, what with the three women acting like simpering junior high school wussies sitting around giggling with their gin, endless cigarettes and a caramel chocolate treat for the one who tells the best 'man' story, and then it gets worse -=- spoiler alert =-= what with Andie's character falling for the young organ player who used to be her student when he was 14 (she's the headmistress of an English school, believe it or not), only to have him destroyed thanks to her bitch-from-hell 'girlfriend' . ..and then from there, it's basically unwatchable claptrap: she forgives her 'friend' and has the organ player's love child and the 3 women end up as they started, drinking more gin and smoking more cigarettes blah blah blah. Andie's character throws the caramel chocolates out in the street, in a pathetic attempt to symbolize growth. Have mercy.",
    "This was awful. Andie Macdowell is a terrible actress. So wooden she makes a rocking horse look like it could do a better job. But then remember that turn in Four Weddings, equally as excruciating. Another film that portrays England as full of Chocolate box cottages, and village greens. I mean that school, how many schools apart from maybe Hogwarts look like that? The twee police station looked like the set from Heartbeat ( a nauseating British series set in the 60s).This film just couldn't make its mind up what it wanted to be- a comedy or a serious examination of the undercurrents in women's friendships. If it had stuck to the former then the graveyard sex scenes and the highly stupid storming of the wedding might just have worked( i say just). But those scenes just didn't work with the tragedy in the second half. I also find it implausible that Kate would ever speak to Molly again after her terrible behaviour. A final note- what is a decent actress like Staunton doing in this pile of poo? Not to mention Anna Chancellor. Macdowell should stick to advertising wrinkle cream.",
    "Caught this on IFC yesterday, and can't believe the positive reviews! Am I the only one who thought these \"ladies\" were anything but? Kate tells Jed she could get fired because she's supposed to be a pillar of the community, but puts out for him! Then they suddenly decide they're in love? And she's SO devastated over his death, she doesn't go to his funeral, much less, tell his family the \"good news\"! By the way, how did an American get to be the headmistress of a very proper British school? Janine should have been kicked off the force for her inexcusable abuse of power, but nothing happens! And she winds up boffing a con she brought in for questioning! And the less said about Molly, the better!<br /><br />As for the guilt Janine and Molly feel over Jed, please! It's the punk's own damn fault he got turned into roadkill! Where's the guilt over poor Gerald, who gets puked on? If only I could do the same to the bozos behind this \"movie\"!",
    "I thought it was a New-York located movie: wrong! It's a little British countryside setting.<br /><br />I thought it was a comedy: wrong! It's a drama.... Well, up to the last third, because after the story becomes totally \"abracadabrantesque\", the symbolic word for a French presidential mandate. It means, close to nonsense even it the motives would like to bring a sincere feeling.<br /><br />What Do I have left? Maybe, a good duo of actress: Yes, I know, they are 3 friends, but the redhead policewoman is a bit invisible for me. The tall doctoress surprises by her punch, and McDowell delivers a fine acting as usual, all in delicate, soft and almost mute attitude. This gentleness puzzles me, because as other fine artists or directors, the same pattern is repeating over and over. In her case, it's like, whatever the movie, it's always the same character defined by her feelings, her values, who lives infinite different stories. I still don't know how to set the limit (or the fusion) between the artists and the works.<br /><br />Another positive side of this movie is its feminine touch & the interesting different points of view. The women have each their own way of living, even if they are all single. It brings a lot of tolerance and learning to witness how a same and unique reality can be perceived in as many ways as people.<br /><br />Finally, the movie is quite viewable, but the great final cuts the desire of a next vision.",
    "Was this meant to be a comedy or a serious drama? This film starts with a light-hearted banter between three women. Fine. It moves into a conflict between the women when one of them meets a man. Fine. There are a few antics between them. Fine. But when the plot thickens and finally becomes black I started to wonder whether I had misinterpreted the first part of the movie. It continues in this vein for a while until, in the end, it tries to go back to the original light-hearted banter. But by now it's too late. It's hard to see why these women would still be talking to one another and the finale is unconvincing. Truly a lesson (for British filmmakers anyway) of how not to make films. Difficult to see how the producers ever convinced themselves this film would work. And the box office proved it to be a real flop, because I'd never heard of this film until this weekend (four years after its release).",

Far fetched no longer covers it. Without these unbelievable scenes, there may have been hope for a sweet love story. Instead, all the viewer is left with is an involuntary shaking of head -- these things just don't happen! Without giving away cliff-hanger details, I warn the viewer of having high expectations for this film; most (like me) will be very disappointed. On a scale of 1 to 10, this one ranks a weak 4 with me. There is much better material out there. This one isn't worth your time.",

    "The worst thing about Crush is not that it's acted pretty bad, or that the plot is virtually non-existent, and it's not even that bad that the camerawork could have been better.<br /><br />No, the worst part of this movie is that it has a few absolutely brilliant moments that keep you hoping that there are more to come.<br /><br />But in the end, it's too little, too late. If you are a fan of violin-music and cheap tearjerking scenes of 40+ women crying and hugging and talking about babies and marriage - then by all means, don't miss it.<br /><br />I myself am not exactly thrilled to see the things listed above in a movie, and as a result I had a pretty horrible time. The few absolutely brilliant jokes can not make up for the rest of it.<br /><br />The verdict: 4/10. Guilty of wasting my time.<br /><br />",
    "Not a `woman film' but film for the gang. One of the worst films ever made by a male director about woman. Director Andy McKay simply doesn't know woman.

I wonder how three good actresses accepted to take part in it.",
    "As a single woman over 40, I found this film extremely insulting and demeaning to single women over 40, not to mention every other woman, of any age. It was a sad, pathetic attempt by a man to write and direct a \"chick flick\", and it failed miserably. Andy McDowell isn't much of an actress to begin with, but given the non-existent \"plot\" (I hate to even refer to it as a plot) in this, she didn't have a chance. There was no character development, no reason to feel sympathy/empathy for any of the characters, and no attempt to make the film in any way realistic or believable. And then there's the obligatory male-fantasy of an attractive straight woman suddenly deciding to give lesbianism a try -- PLEASE.<br /><br />Not only do I wish I could get my money back for the DVD rental, I also want those 112 minutes of my life back. What a ripoff.",
    "I was gifted with this movie as it had such a great premise, the friendship of three women bespoiled by one falling in love with a younger man.<br /><br />Intriguing.<br /><br />NOT! I hasten to add. These women are all drawn in extreme caricature, not very supportive of one another and conspiring and contriving to bring each other down.<br /><br />Anna Chancellor and Imelda Staunton could do no wrong in my book prior to seeing this, but here they are handed a dismal script and told to balance the action between slapstick and screwball, which doesn't work too well when the women are all well known professionals in a very small town.<br /><br />And for intelligent women they spend a whole pile of time bemoaning the lack of men/sex/lust in their lives. I felt much more could have been made of it given a decent script and more tension, the lesbian sub-plot went nowhere and those smoking/drinking women (all 3 in their forties???) were very unrealistic - even in the baby scene - screw the baby, gimme a cigarette! Right.<br /><br />Like I said, a shame of a waste. 4 out of 10.",
    "\"The Crush\" is a pleasant enough 40-something friends romantic chick flick for the first two-thirds or so, as it tries to be a Brit \"Sex and the City\". <br /><br />I particularly enjoyed the turn-around of the trophy young hunk whose character is not much fleshed out (come to think of it we didn't see all that much physical flesh of him either and Kenny Doughty is worth seeing more of). <br /><br />They sure make a lot more deal of young man/older woman than was made of the opposite in either version of \"Sabrina\" (neither movie do I like) or for that matter with the Douglas/Zeta-Jones or Dion/Svengali nuptials.<br /><br />Surrounding Andie MacDowell as an ex pat otherwise are welcome familiars from Brit dramas and comedies, such as tart-tongued Anna Chancellor. <br /><br />The plot twists towards the end feel very deus ex machina. But it wasn't until the credits came up at the end that I realized what might really be wrong. Just as with \"Sex and the City,\" the writer/director is male, here first-timer Scot John McKay, and I think he really wanted to do a script about three gay men, probably about them coming out in relation to their lovers and at work (the characters are a school principal, a cop and a doctor), which would have been a better and more interesting movie. The working title for the film was \"The Sad F*cker's Club\" which would have made its parallels with the gay \"Broken Hearts Club\" even more obvious.<br /><br />(originally written 4/6/2002)",
    "it MIGHT have been a good movie if it had explored something more interesting rather than just the surface of a lesbian relationship if this was the meaning of the movie...it is quite predictable not mentioning that the two girls resemble the Russian group t.A.T.u....coincidence? i don't think so. There is nothing original in this movie to support it so they had to use something which is already famous.You know the recipe. The other actors...well,i just don't know what their role is supposed to be. Most of them are well - known people in Romania and i must mention some of them are not even actors(e.g.Mihaela Radulescu).SO to summarize it: \"girl band tatty\"+desperate/publicity needing \"actors\"+ a non-existing plot+ the occasion to use bad language in order to shock= Love sick....too bad...the idea was good,though...and i am seriously holding myself from commenting the title...",
    "***LIGHT SPOILER ALERT*** The story sounds good and if you've read the novel, then you're probably expecting a deep and intense movie that could offer some insight for some interesting and insufficiently explored human relationships.<br /><br />True enough, the script tries to do that, the director tries to do that, but the main cast fails miserably. Maria's acting is so dry that lacks any feeling whatsoever, her most intense moments seem almost comical. Sometimes she seems to be nervous due to the camera. Her only really feeling scene is near the end where she gets dumped by her girlfriend.<br /><br />Ioana seems even more tense than Maria and even worse, she doesn't seem natural at all. Maria had the attitude, even if it was artificially pushed towards being obvious, but she had it and her character received some credibility. And to make matters worse, we don't have an insight on her: where does she come from, how come she got involved in the lesbian relationship, how did the relationship evolve? We only get some bits from her parents and their relationship just seems to 'be' there: it has a content and and end, but no beginning. Just like her partner Maria, she has only once scene that is truly touching, the scene where she dumps Maria's character Kiki.<br /><br />Tudor is the only person in this movie (aside from the landlady, great acting there) who manages to prove some acting talent. He has his character's attitude and it fits him. Only once or twice he seems to falter (the scene at his parents' meal, he tries to be obvious when it wasn't necessary at all).<br /><br />I love the story, Tudor Chirila is OK there, the landlady actually acts and Puya delivers his couple of lines with style, but this doesn't save the movie. Too bad, the entire setting had huge potential and the Romanian cinematography could've used a movie on this theme.<br /><br />Oddly enough, the incestuous relationship between brother and sister seems to have more credibility than the no-background no-feeling (well, Maria's spoken interludes are a nice try in this direction) lesbian relationship of Maria and Ioana. I'm quite sorry for spending money on a ticket, I'd rather had watched it from the comfort of my room.",
    "This is a movie that relies solely on the somewhat controversial image of incest and lesbianism to get noticed.That is it.The dialogs are pathetic and the sensuality of the \"sex scenes\" is absolutely absent.The acting and the dialog are more suited for high-school children,yet the subject is intended for adult audiences. It is a gutless and shallow movie.It could have been way better if it had a story and more drama. Ah and on top of that, one more thing: why are inner monologues so excessively used? Makes it seem so cheap.All in all an embarrassing movie for Romanian cinema as well as for mature audiences attempting to view it.I know the means are scarce but, that is not always an excuse for a movie flopping as this one does.And please start using some good actors in your movies and stop recycling them from musicians (Tudor Chirila) - they can't act!",

    "Considering that this movie had a serious and quite successful launching campaign, I would have expected something to be worth the fuzz...from the opening scene on (in which the two brothers \"sensually\" caress each other, laying naked in a bed) it goes rapidly downwards...nothing to get the attention, not a mind-catching thing in the whole plot, baaad baad acting (a few minor exceptions, but artificiality is at its best). Incest and lesbianism are promising themes, but the script analyses none of the two in depth ( mind that a possible excuse of the makers, saying that they aimed for a subtle movie would be hilarious, unless subtle and superficial mean the same thing...). The too curious viewers will not get any interesting scene...at this point, that could have saved some of the movie...so you can imagine how bad it is. Many other things could be said...but please watch the movie yourselves...I am an egoist and I would like as many people as possible to waste about 1 1/2h of their lives...like I did :(",
    "Yes, indeed, it could have been a good movie. A love biangle, (sorry for the poetical license, but is not a triangle!) an interesting story, unfortunately badly told. The image is sometimes weird, sometimes OK, the picture looks crowded and narrow-sighted. The sound needs more attention (it usually does in Romanian movies), the light and color filters are sometimes badly chosen. The soundtrack is short and is not helping the action. About the acting... sorry but the best actress is the landlady. The others are acting immaturely and cannot convince the viewer. The acting is poetical when it should be realistic, and realistic when it should be poetical. It's a picture for adults, told by the children. Bother only if extremely curious.",
    "Closer to reality and containing more depth than \"Breakdance\", Stan Lathan's \"Beat Street\" is still a pretty dull show. Again this pic is really only cashing in on the 'breakin' craze but at least we get a little bit of entertainment from the plot, which concerns the lives of three young friends and a younger brother, all growing up in Queens, New York. Each has their own unique talent. One is a hustler, one a d.j., another an artist who creates 'burners', while little bro' Lee is a hot 'hip hop' dancer.<br /><br />Lathan is unable to generate any real audience interest in the story though, and his young cast are likewise struggling with their characters. Therefore it is left almost entirely to the funky music and the 'fresh' dancing to save the day.<br /><br />Choreography is again sharp for both club and street scenes, but this alone is not enough to lift \"\"Beat Street\" to greater heights. Unfortunately the film really falls flat late on, after showing a glimmer of hope that it just might get interesting.<br /><br />Sunday, August 25, 1996 - Video",
    "Hilariously obvious \"drama\" about a bunch of high school (I think) kids who enjoy non-stop hip-hop, break dancing, graffiti and trying to become a dj at the Roxy--or something. To be totally honest I was so bored I forgot! Even people who love the music agree this movie is terribly acted and--as a drama--failed dismally. We're supposed to find this kids likable and nice. I found them bland and boring. The one that I REALLY hated was Ramon. He does graffiti on subway trains and this is looked upon as great. Excuse me? He's defacing public property that isn't his to begin with. Also these \"great\" kids tap into the city's electricity so they can hold a big dance party at an abandoned building. Uh huh. So we're supposed to find a bunch of law breakers lovable and fun.<br /><br />I could forgive all that if the music was good but I can't stand hip hop. The songs were--at best--mediocre and they were nonstop! They're ALWAYS playing! It got to the point that I was fast-forwarding through the many endless music numbers. (Cut out the music and you haver a 30 minute movie--maybe) There are a few imaginative numbers--the subway dance fight, a truly funny Santa number and the climatic Roxy show. If you love hip hop here's your movie. But it you're looking for good drama mixed in--forget it. Also HOW did this get a PG rating? There's an incredible amount of swearing in this.",
    "Maybe you shouldn't compare, but Wild Style and Style Wars are original Hip Hop. Beat Street does have a lot of the original artists of early Hip Hop, but they've been obviously made clear that this could be their big break, of course for some it was and that's nice. But if you view this as original Hip Hop Culture you're wrong. It's overproduced and has a Hollywood sauce. Rather look for the first two movies i mentioned. They have convey the grittiness that comes with life in the ghetto. Yes, the rating for this movie is low, but the reviews are mostly positive or even raving. This is probably because although the story, the acting, the dialogues and the direction all are dreadful, the music and dancing is what the people love about it. Me, i do love the dancing but at the time thought that electro was the death of Hip Hop (i was so glad when round '86 a new generation of now classic Hip Hop artists appeared, like Krs One, Public Enemy, Ultramagnetic Mc's, Jungle Brothers, Bizmarkie to name a few), and i still don't like most of the beats in this movie and that is why it doesn't work for me. I mean, Wild Style has not much of a story but the music there is great and authentic. Of course tastes differ and that's alright. But as far as i'm concerned, this movie is trash except for the break dancing and some of the music and so i can't rate it higher than a 4 out of ten.",
    "I could never stand watching Happy Days after Chachi joined the cast, so I knew I was in trouble when the best scene in this movie featured Scott Baio (a skateboard chase scene!). Jodie Foster in her first \"grown-up\" role turns in her usual professional performance but that is no excuse for this boring mess. Two hours out of my life that I'll never get back! No noteworthy characters, unbelievable storyline, questionable editing and horrendous cinematography but worst of all, I couldn't have cared less. The story of California teens in the 1970's, where the kids live miserable lives and all their parents are idiots. Don't waste your time watching this ugly excuse for a movie.",
    "Horrible film with bits of the Ramones strewn about. Your worse than average 1970's/80's comedy format of the cool kids taking over the school with some whimsical plan. This movie is terrible. The plot consists of a girl who enjoys the Ramones and a school bent on fighting against their oppressive administration. Forget this movie and watch something like Wild Zero starring Guitar Wolf if you want an entertaining B movie. Terrible acting, terrible writing, terrible plot with the stamp of approval of the Ramones who probably needed some money quick so they said yes to this movie. That is the only logical thing I can think of because this movie blows.",
    "This movie is a 90 minute Ramones concert with brief periods of stupidity and absolute boredom. What kind of high school is this anyway?<br /><br />Unless you are a major Ramones fan, DO NOT and I repeat DO NOT waste your time like I did. This is utterly unwatchable from start to finish. This movie should be called Ramone Fever. Everyone appears to like them in this movie. There is not a plot to be found in this flick. As far as teen comedies go, you are scraping the bottom of the barrel with this one.",
    "I gave this film 2 stars only because Dominic Monaghan actually put effort through in his acting. Everything else about this film is extremely amateur. Everything associated with the direction of this film was very poorly executed. Not only should the director rethink what she is doing for a life career but maybe she should watch a few films. As Dominic Monaghan is a very credible actor, placing him in a film of this caliber makes him look awful. Whomever the \"actor\" was that played Jack's best friend should never have stepped in front of the camera. I didn't expect much from such a small film, but perhaps a little more time and effort should be put into the characters and their surroundings. Don't waste your time or money on this film (like I did) you will be sorely disappointed.",
    "I jumped at the chance to view this movie uncut and uninterrupted, remembering rahs and raves for it. But wherever it seemed about to slip into being truly scary, it backed off and went somewhere else. The dripping water throughout the house, the black rain, the prophetic dreams, taking the wrong turn in raw sewage were dropped before they could work up to a scream.<br /><br />What a disappointment. Chamberlain's nearly expressionless mask of a face offered little but confused disbelief, something I found myself mirroring as the film wore on. What could have been eerie Aboriginal chanting and instruments in the background were instead a cacophony seemingly designed to beat terror into one's head. The ideas that modern people can embody ancient gods, that the Aboriginal peoples believe red-haired white men were the first priests, and many other possibilities are passed along more like a shopping list than a hint at another dimension (the Dream Time).<br /><br />[SPOILER] In the final scene, it wasn't clear to me what the director was trying to tell. Is there a big wave? So what? How big? A tsunami? Yeah, okay. That's devastating but not apocalyptic. Is it the end of the world? From a wave? The last wave? That'd have to be a pretty darn big wave. Why? Was the world that bad a place? It didn't seem so awful in this movie. Actually I didn't think the wave came off, since the shadow left Burton's face that had been cast by the wave. Was it only Burton's apocalypse? Heck, that happens every day to people who lose it. It wasn't of any interest if it was only him.<br /><br />The most frightening scene, and the one that gives the best indication of Weir's potential, was in Charlie's apartment where Burton has gone to confront the old man for scaring Burton's wife. Charlie keeps asking him \"Who are you?\" and it becomes truly disturbing after a while. Unfortunately, the movie never followed suit.",
    "The perfect murder is foiled when a wife(played by Mary Ellen Trainor, once the wife to director Robert Zemeckis, who helmed this episode), who murders her husband with a poker, has the misfortune of receiving a visitor as she is about to move the body outside..an escaped insane madman dressed in a Santa Claus suit(played by a deviously hideous Larry Drake). She fends for her life while trying to find a way of hiding her husband's corpse. She decides to use an ax, once she downs the Santa killer who misses several chances to chop off the woman's head, to frame the killer for her husband's murder. Santa killer locks her in a closet and pursues the woman's daughter as she tries desperate to free herself to save the child.<br /><br />This episode of TALES FROM THE CRYPT just recycles tired material involving the old \"Santa kills\" theme while also adding the oft-used(add nauseum)woman-murders-her-husband-for-a-man-she's-been-cheating-with routine. It's essentially Trainor trying to find a way to avoid being caught with a dead body she kills while also keeping a safe distance from a maniac. There's nothing refreshing or new about this plot which pretty much goes through the motions. Not one of the show's highlights.",
    "That's not the sound of bees, that's the effect induced by watching this extremely long, extremely boring, badly acted movie. How I ever made it through all 3 1/2 hours without falling asleep I'll never know. The plot is simple...3 thoroughly unlikable morons talk about sex for 3 1/2 hours. And you thought Rohmer was deadly. This is even worse, if that's possible. > I must really be a masochist if I could watch this entire movie without turning it off...or killing someone.",
    "Iberia is nice to see on TV. But why see this in silver screen? Lot of dance and music. If you like classical music or modern dance this could be your date movie. But otherwise one and half hour is just too long time. If you like to see skillful dancing in silver screen it's better to see Bollywood movie. They know how to combine breath taking dancing to long movie. Director Carlos Saura knows how to shoot dancing from old experience. And time to time it's look really good. but when the movie is one and hour it should be at least most of time interesting. There are many kind of art not everything is bigger then life and this film is not too big.",
    "That reviewers liked this movie surprises me. The plot is a muddle. The characters are wooden. Michael Bowen spends most of the film spying on the other characters and misjudging all of them. No one has any redeeming quality or point-of-interest. This is not an edgy work. It is not imaginative. It is not ironic. It is no clever. There is nothing straight forward about this tedious work. That is missed theatrical release is not surprise. That the \"This Network\" airs it diminishes that venue. I definitely recommend turning to a rerun of the Garden Smart show on PBS or even a good informational if you encountered this mess on late night television. If you encounter it on daytime television, take a long walk. Even if you walk in smog, you will feel better not having suffered through this shambles. Life is short. This movie is long.",
    "This is a terrible movie, terrible script, bad direction and nonsensical ending. Also, bad performances, except from Clancy Brown who is criminally underused here, and Michael Pollard. Watching this movie was purgatory--you do it to unload enough bad movie karma to actually see a good one further down the line.<br /><br />The movie presents a father and son who look like they couldn't every possibly have been related. The part of the male lead is not well written and seems uncharismatic in this role. You can see the plot points a mile away. The actions of the female lead and that of her brother, the cop, also make no sense. So, a major action on her part at the end of the movie makes no sense script-wise.",
    "Burt Kennedy used to be a very good director, but you'd never know it by this lumbering mess. Not only does this film look cheap, it IS cheap--most of the battle scenes are lifted from the far superior \"The Last Command\" from 1955, and that footage, shot 32 years previously, looks more contemporary than anything in this picture. The few action scenes that were actually shot for this movie are disorganized, confused and incompetent, looking just as shoddy as the rest of the picture. This has the look and feel of a bad student film (and the budget didn't seem to be a whole lot more). It moves like molasses, the acting for the most part is either over-the-top ham or under-the-top comatose--although Raul Julia comes off better than most of the rest of the cast--and it's chock full of annoying historical inaccuracies. On top of that, it's WAY too long. If you're going to make a boring film, do it in an hour or so and get it over with--don't stretch it out over three hours, like this one does. If you want to see a good movie about the Alamo, check out John Wayne's 1960 version, or even the 1955 film from which this movie stole its action scenes. Hard to believe it took six producers to make a movie this lousy. Skip it.",
    "While being a great James Arness western, this film has gone down as the worst Alamo film ever made. The story was terrible, inaccuracy all through it, and just downright untruths to boot! Continuity was cast to the four winds. Anybody catch the cannon sequence? The Mexicans were dumb enough to fire cannons that obviously had mud and ramrods still sticking out of the tubes. Come on! Then there is Brian Keith's ridiculous hat! Costumer must of been away or something. Or just out of their mind!",
    "This movie is flawed on many fronts. Like many before it, it portrays more of the mythology of the Alamo than the history. The production is poor, overall giving the impression of a welfare project for lots of actors who might have otherwise had to work on Hollywood Squares. This to me was the greatest flaw - I know the ages and general personalities of the real Alamo protagonists and the geriatric ensemble of TV actors chosen to portray them never let any hint of believability intrude.<br /><br />As a native Texan, I grew up with the mythology. I later learned more about the history. I can accept a decent production from either perspective (although I prefer more historical accuracy), but this never gave me a chance to enjoy it. Even John Wayne's or Fess Parker's versions had more life than this stolid mess, while being only slightly less accurate.<br /><br />Very disappointing - avoid it.",
    "Slow and riddled with inaccuracy. Over-looking its flaws this is still an interesting account of the famed and heroic siege of the Alamo during the Texas fight for independence from Mexico. James Arness as Jim Bowie. Brian Keith as Davy Crockett. Alec Baldwin as Col. Travis. Raul Julia as General Santa Anna. This made-for-TV project also stars David Ogden Stiers, Kathleen York and Jim Metzler. Very good original music by Peter Bernstein.",
    "This film, The Alamo:Thirteen Days to Glory, is utter rubbish. The acting is awful, it is far too patriotic and its historical accuracy is not always at its best (Historians would have a field day). It does have a few good moments but not enough to keep interest because it is far too long. Rating * out of **********.",
    "The story by Norman Maclean is a masterwork; Redford's film is a mediocrity. He adds banal scenes of the Maclean brothers going over a falls and of them double-dating in a seedy bar that were not even hinted at in the story. The cipher, Brad Pitt, trying to play the charismatic Paul Maclean, a genius outdoors, proves either risible or depressing, depending on what the original story meant to you. Some of the fly casting scenes are beautiful. Also, Tom Skerritt as the father and Craig Sheffer as Norman are strong and masculine, as men were once expected to be. None of the women make an impression in the film, which is regrettable, because Maclean loved the women in his story and made this clear, even poetic.",
    "The only good part about this film is the beautiful scenery. This movie was long and boring. The minister should have retired from the pulpit the time his son Paul strayed from the teachings he proclaimed. How many times can his boys take the Lord's name in vain in this film being from a Presbyterian background? It doesn't fit. I wished Paul was swept down the river without a boat at the very beginning to spare us the silly, smirkish, selfish story of Paul (Brad Pitt). So Norm becomes a teacher and Paul becomes a compulsive gambler who Norm wants to rescue but doesn't-so what. It's very uninteresting. We see the prejudiced whites being stood up to by Paul because of his native American girl. That was the only part that had some interest and maybe could have been developed into a real 'wild western'. What we only see is a sleepy town where the two minister's sons have nothing to do but 1. Norm chase a lame girlfriend and deal with her family and 2.Paul make up dumb stories at the newspaper shop while scratching his head and take a lot of swigs and tie a lot of flies. I'd rather watch a show about fishing that that film again-which will be never.",
    "... to not live in Montana and especially not to live there at the end of the 19th century.<br /><br />\"A river runs through it\" certainly is a well made movie from a cineastic stand-point. Great landscapes, Redford acting well.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the story is bad (if there is a story at all).<br /><br />I felt sorry for the narrator / author, who is as dry, narrow-minded a character as his father, a preacher. Being driven, not driving his own life, he is left to watch his brother, who is also caged in the small town environment, losing his life. The author never even comes close to undestand his brother's motivations, but at least realizes, that he is lacking the slightest amount of homour / fun. All there is, is fly-fishing, where he follows even as an old man the style of his father.<br /><br />The end is not surprising, it is forseeable from the very beginning.<br /><br />Definitely NOT a must-see (3 / 10)<br /><br />",
    "I always felt that a good film should have a plot. This particular film was missing one, and I feel that it would have been more effective with a plot. This was made even worse by the fact that it seemed to go on forever; I was anxious for it to finally end. However, I just noticed that it was only 123 minutes long; it felt like four hours. Not only was there no plot but the film also lacked a notable conflict. It's not the worst movie I've seen, but I used to say that it was until I saw \"The Fast And The Furious\". So, don't think this review of mine is from someone who needs nothing but action. I actually hate most action films out today; it's just that this film is all the way on the other side of the spectrum. Not much really happens in this movie. However, the scenery and costumes were nice.",

    "Mann photographs the Alberta Rocky Mountains in a superb fashion, and Jimmy Stewart and Walter Brennan give enjoyable performances as they always seem to do. <br /><br />But come on Hollywood - a Mountie telling the people of Dawson City, Yukon to elect themselves a marshal (yes a marshal!) and to enforce the law themselves, then gunfighters battling it out on the streets for control of the town? <br /><br />Nothing even remotely resembling that happened on the Canadian side of the border during the Klondike gold rush. Mr. Mann and company appear to have mistaken Dawson City for Deadwood, the Canadian North for the American Wild West.<br /><br />Canadian viewers be prepared for a Reefer Madness type of enjoyable howl with this ludicrous plot, or, to shake your head in disgust.",
    "This is an action Western. James Steart leads an all star cast in the scenic Northwest, which is filmed in great splendor. The scenery and costumes are great. There is action and adventure. Stewart plays a wealthy cattleman who runs afoul of a crooked government in the old Nothwest.<br /><br />The main drawback is the stereotypical cynic that Hollywood has always made into a hero. Even when this movie was made, the cynic was the stereotypical hero, and the one Stewart portrays really has few saving graces. He is kind to his two partners, and that does give him an extra dimension of credibility and likability.<br /><br />However, he is so piggish to everyone else, it is hard to really care for him, or to accept him. He is much like the one dimensional spaghetti Western characters (cut not that bad).<br /><br />Still, the minor characters are quite enjoyable. Walter Brennan, Royal Dano, Harry Morgan, and others make this worth watching.",
    "This is the worst sequel on the face of the world of movies. Once again it doesn't make since. The killer still kills for fun. But this time he is killing people that are making a movie about what happened in the first movie. Which means that it is the stupidest movie ever.<br /><br />Don't watch this. If you value the one precious hour during this movie then don't watch it. You'll want to ask the director and the person beside you what made him make it. Because it just doesn't combine the original makes of horror, action, and crime.<br /><br />Don't let your children watch this. Teenager, young child or young adult, this movie has that sorta impact upon people.",
    "Ah, Channel 5 of local Mexican t.v. Everyday, at 2:00 a.m. they air Horror movies from the 70's to early 2000's. It was \"Return To Cabin By The Lake\" the movie that aired yesterday. I regret for watching it.<br /><br />The original \"Cabin By The Lake\" was a regularly popular low budgeter and it was good accepted. The problem is that this sequel is horrible, not even unintentionally funny and tries to imitate the original. Ugh. The plot is really stupid in all the sense of the word.<br /><br />The movie at some points looks like a soap-opera because of it's absurd dialogs, cinematography, and direction.<br /><br />My advice is : avoid this one at all costs. It's a movie that it shouldn't be watched by anyone. Not even for lovers of mediocre film-making.<br /><br />You have been warned.",
    "Preposterous sequel stretches credibility to a great degree as diabolical sociopath Stanley Kaldwell returns this time infiltrating the movie production of the novel he wrote for the garden drownings, assuming the identity of a second unit director he murdered.<br /><br />Film pokes gleeful fun at Hollywood, with a tongue-in-cheek script taking shots at tyrannical directors who sleep with their actresses(..looking for a way up the ladder)and dislike anyone challenging them for complete spotlight. Brian Krause, who I thought was dreadful, overacting to the point where the satire felt incredibly forced, portrays the loud, temperamental director who doesn't like the fact that his second unit director and screenplay writer, Alison(..played by Dahlia Salem)seem to be taking over the production. Andrew Moxham is Paul Parsons, who is the brother of a victim from the first film. The film's dark humor this time takes the idea of a serial killer actually operating as director of a movie set and exploits it for all it's worth. Nelson again ably slides back into his psycho role without any difficulty, with Stanley as clever as ever, using his brains to commandeer a film production, killing whoever he has to in order to maintain full control of his work, letting no one stand in his way..that is until Alison realizes who Stanley really is. Alison is the type of ambitious writer who wants to capture the essence of her subject..what motivated Stanley to kill, why would he do such a thing, and what led such a man down this dark path? The humor of Alison actually working with that very man is also part of the satire at the heart of this dark comedy thriller. Of course, you get the inevitable showdown between Alison and Stanley, with a really ridiculous, unbelievable conclusion regarding the killer's fate(..quite a hard pill to swallow). Unlike the first film, which was photographed with sophisticated polish, director Po-Chih Leong uses unnecessary techniques which are not needed(..such as shooting an all kinds of weird angles, slow-motion in a sepia color, and several instances which are captured on video)and rather annoy instead of impress. This sequel, to me, just wasn't on target as much as the original, with a lot of the humor less effective and more obvious.",
    "Return to Cabin by the Lake just.... was lacking. It must have had a very low budget because a fair amount of the movie must have been filmed with a regular video camera. So, within the same scene - you'll have some movie-quality camera shots AND simple video camera shots. It makes for a very odd blend! I think they should have found SOME way to not do the \"home video\" type effect! <br /><br />I think it's worthwhile to see it IF you have seen the original CBTL because then you can compare and see the differences. But if you haven't seen the original CBTL.... you'll never want to see it if you see this one first! It will probably seem way too cheesy and turn you off from even caring about the original one.",
    "This movie was made-for-TV, so taking that into account, I'm not going to rip into it as hard as I would a feature film. The script is sub-par, but it does succeed in being mildly humorous in spots, whether it means to be or not. The acting is mostly over-the-top, but that is true for many lower-budget movies.<br /><br />The aspect of this movie that I really hated, though, was that 90-95% of it is shot on film, but in random places, there will be 5-10 seconds where the footage is shot on video. You can tell because there is less contrast, the colors are less vivid, and the footage is clearly 30 frames per second instead of film's 24 frames per second. I'm not sure if maybe these scenes had to be shot later and at that time they didn't have the money to shoot on film (I assume this is why, anyway), but it is disorienting and really makes the film look shoddier than it had to look.<br /><br />Anyway, I've definitely seen worse movies, but I definitely wouldn't say that I enjoyed this movie and I can't recommend that anyone see it.",
    "IF you are planning to see this movie, please reconsider. I don't usually post my comments about something I've seen on television, but this one was such a waste of my life that I needed to do something productive to get that bad taste out of my mouth. Critiquing this movie would take far too long as there are so many things wrong with it. I will just simply say, please do not ever see this movie. It was a complete waste of my time and it WILL be a waste of yours. Anyone that wrote a positive review of this movie is one of two things; utterly inept, or working for the company that produced it. Again, I guarantee that you will indeed regret seeing this movie!",
    "<br /><br />I saw this on the Sci-Fi channel. It came on right after the first one. For some reason this movie kept me interested. I don't know why, stop asking.<br /><br />---SPOILERS--- Okay... It was cheesy how this guy got involved with the making of the movie. In the first movie, he had a \"reason\" to kill people, but in this sequal, half of the killings/attempted killings were basicly for no reason. Stanley killed the director due to creative differences, he captured the co-writer due to creative differences, but what was the deal with trying to kill off the cast? No cast, no movie. He wanted it to \"look real when they died\"? If this was supposed to be such a high budget movie, use the special effects, MAN. Of course like the first one, the captured girl gets away, and Stanley ends up getting messed up, and dissapears. Woooooow (sarcasm). This movie HAD potential. And the saddest thing of all... the really sad part... I would watch a \"Cabin by the Lake 3\". Only because I like Judd Nelson, and he's the only good part about this sequal.",
    "I watched Cabin by the Lake this afternoon on USA. Considering this movie was made for TV is was interesting enough to watch the sequel. So, I tune in for the airing this evening and was extremely disappointed. I knew I wouldn't like the movie, but I was not expecting to be perplexed by the use of DV (digital video). The movie would have been tolerable if it wasn't for these juxtaposed digital shots that seemed to come from nowhere. I expected the plot line to be tied in with these shots, but there seemed to be no logical explanation. (WARNING: THE FOLLOWING MAYBE A SPOILER!!!!) The open ending in Cabin by the Lake was acceptable, but the open ending on the sequel is ridiculous. I can only foresee Return of Return to The Cabin by the Lake being watch able is if the movie was shown up against nothing, but infomercials at 4 o'clock in the morning.",
    "A decent sequel, but does not pack the punch of the original. A murderous screenwriter(Judd Nelson)assumes new identities in order to direct his own novel CABIN BY THE LAKE. Still ruthless killing, but movie seems very tongue-in-cheek. Any humor is not of the funny kind. Total project seems to have the quality of a quickie and at times Nelson is way over the top. This movie is about a script being rewritten before going to the screen...this should have happened to this script.",
    "Return to Cabin by the Lake does not, in any way, stand up to the original. With only one main character (Stanley) returning for the sequal, the film is not even worth the 2 hours of your time. I am a huge fan of the first film, the story line and acting was really good, but this is one movie that I will never again watch. It is basically equal to what the sequals to Urban Legends and Blair Witch were like, but with much worse acting. I've personally seen better acting in soap operas, it is so pitiful that you just have to laugh. I, in no way, recommend this movie to anyone, watching it will just detract from the first.",
    "I thought Hedy Burress (who managed to escape from the watery grave of part one) was going to be in part 2 Guess not. I just think they should of killed her off like in Friday The 13th Part 2 (you know what I mean).<br /><br />This movie like Scream 3, and Urban Legend 2 followed movies within a movie.<br /><br />This was PURE CRAP! The whole Movie within a Movie crap.<br /><br />BAD STAY AWAY!",
    "Viewers gushing over everything including the title sequence (now THAT is funny) would have us believe this is some sort of cinematic miracle, but, trust me folks, this is one of the most embarrassingly bad films you could ever see, and if you're not laughing at it five minutes in, I'd say you've lost your sense of humor.<br /><br />David Niven plays a doomed and bravado-besotted RAF pilot who somehow thinks it appropriate to engage an impressionable (female) air traffic controller in an emotional conversation about love, just as he's plunging to his certain and fiery death. (Isn't it romantic...) Of course, he's spared by a quirk of metaphysical chance, and washes up on the beach, just as this same air traffic controller is riding by on her bicycle. (They immediately clinch).<br /><br />Looking past the bizarre homo-erotic subtexts, (so over the top you really need to refer to them as supertexts, from a naked boy sitting bare-butted in the sand playing the movie's twilight-zone-esquire theme on his little flute, to a celestial courier so campy/queen-y his makeup is caked on more thoroughly than the ladies'), the most bizarre aspects of the movie are how it weaves such bad caricatures of national and racial stereotypes into a convoluted attempt to argue some kind of point about the universal nature and power of love. We get it--fly boys like girls in skirts and heels, and girls like 'em back, and, apparently, all you have to do is cry a little to make it noble enough for your movie to get 10 stars on IMDb...<br /><br />As for the quality of the production, the continuity/editing is poor enough to induce cringing, and the lighting is, perhaps, even worse than that, but you hardly have time to notice because the script is so bad. There are games played with Technicolor, (whatever passes for heaven is in black and white if you can figure out the sense in that), and foreshadowing, (so funny my fellow audience member who usually like movies like this actually cheered and laughed when then the doc's motorcycle finally ended up in a fiery wreck), and freeze-motion, (which is funniest of all because the female lead is so poor at standing still you know the stage hands were guffawing off camera).<br /><br />The best shots are the early ones on the beach, but, after that, it's all downhill. The (moving like an escalator is moving) staircase is hardly the Odessa Steps, to say the least, and I'd really caution anyone from feeling like they'd have to see this lame attempt at movie-making on their account. The movie overall is bad enough to be funny, and that's about the best thing I can say for it."

    "\"I Am Curious: Yellow\" is a laughable and pretentious film that fails to be taken seriously, regardless of one's political views. The claim that frontal male nudity always results in an NC-17 rating is false, as there are R-rated films that feature male nudity, albeit briefly. However, films with explicit female genitalia are nearly nonexistent in mainstream cinema or television, revealing an apparent cultural discomfort with depicting women's bodies authentically.",
    "To prevent making such a film again, this movie is interesting as an experiment but lacks a clear story. Some may feel good for watching it due to its discussion of important issues, but it doesn't have a clear purpose. The viewer doesn't gain new insights, unless they think of some while their mind wanders during this pointless film. It might be more worthwhile to spend time watching a tree grow outside a window.",
    "This movie seems to take inspiration from Godard's Masculin, féminin and I recommend watching that instead. The film excels in two areas: the authentic acting and the impressive cinematography. However, what stands out the most is the constant display of triviality. Lena Nyman's performance may come across as irritating, portraying stupidity and excessive nudity that may not be appealing. In contrast to Godard's work, this film seems to lack the intellectual depth and opts for a more foolish approach. Such differences could be attributed to the ideals of French and Swedish societies. This movie reflects the time and location in which it was made. Rating: 2/10.",
    "Upon hearing about this peculiar film for numerous years, I am reminded of the classic Peggy Lee song, \"Is that all there is?\". When this controversial film first emerged in the United States, I was just a young teenager and unable to attend the theater showing, although I did manage to sneak into \"Goodbye Columbus\". Eventually, I had the opportunity to view this film at a local film museum, yet by then, I found myself as old as my parents were when they originally watched it.\n\nThe sole reason this film did not fade into obscurity was due to the obscenity case that it incited upon its U.S. release. Many individuals flocked to witness this film under the false impression that it was a scandalous piece of erotica, only to be met with unappealing visuals of Swedish settings, banal street interviews, absurd political undertones, and lackluster simulated intimate scenes featuring unimpressive actors.\n\nThough some may regard it as a cultural icon, a holy grail, or a historic artifact, the general sentiment leans towards shunning it, incinerating its remnants, and sealing its ashes within a leaden chest. Despite the efforts of elite aesthetes in extracting value from its dreary pseudo-revolutionary political spiel, without the censorship controversy, it would likely have been overlooked and left to fade away.\n\nInstead, the rhythmic title of \"I Am Blank, Blank\" was incessantly echoed as a tantalizing lure for various genres of adult cinema (e.g., \"I am Curious, Lavender\" for LGBTQ films, \"I am Curious, Black\" for blaxploitation films), propelling periodic resurgences for a fresh wave of viewers enticed by the allure of a pioneering \"erotic\" masterpiece that reshaped the industry.\n\nIn conclusion, it is recommended to abstain from this ailing creation. Should one feel compelled to see it, opting to rent the video and promptly fast-forwarding to the salacious segments would deliver a swift resolution to the ordeal.",
    "I'd place this film right at the top of my list of unwatchable trash! It's the kind of movie that's not just bad, but so unbearable that you're expected to like it because it's supposed to be good for you. The sex scenes, once considered shocking, couldn't even excite a rabbit. The so-called controversial politics feel like something out of a high school sophomore's amateur night in Marxism. The film tries too hard to be arty, but ends up failing miserably. The grainy black and white photography, out-of-focus shots, and bad sound all contribute to a film that some dare to call art?",
    "The screenplay writer for this movie clearly did not refer to any books on Lucille Ball, particularly her autobiography. There are numerous inaccuracies in this biopic, from her early years in Celoron and Jamestown to her later life with Desi. I can easily point out numerous factual errors, but the list would be endless. Ultimately, I feel that Lucille Ball is a unique individual who can only be authentically portrayed by herself. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be upset by the multitude of errors in this film. Despite the filmmakers' efforts, the movie comes across as extremely sloppy to me.",
    "The actress who played Lucille Ball in this movie, Rachel York, did not do a good job. The portrayal of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz by York and Danny Pino was disappointing. I recommend watching other shows like A&E Biography of Lucy and Desi or reading Lucille Ball's book for a better understanding of their lives. Another docudrama called \"Before the Laughter\" has a better casting of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz.",
    "This movie is a bloated production that lacks substance, despite its attractive cast. The plot is weak, the character dynamics feel forced, and the music is poorly matched. It tries to rely on good intentions, but ultimately falls short. Despite its historical significance due to Dorothy Stratten's involvement, it is not as memorable as Bogdanovich's earlier works. Overall, it's a harmless film, but not worth watching.",
    "This movie is Peter Bogdanovich's personal creation, a twist on his life where detectives take the spotlight. These suave detectives effortlessly romance stunning models, more akin to wealthy playboy filmmakers than actual crime-solvers. Bogdanovich penned the entire script, revealing his disconnect from everyday folk. They say write what you know, and he certainly did, resulting in a film that leaves the audience feeling bored, puzzled, and even envious. This gem might only appeal to those curious about Dorothy Stratten, tragically murdered shortly after filming. Yet, Patti Hanson steals the show, bringing her own flair to the screen. Stratten's presence feels forced, adding little to the already intricate plot. Ultimately, the characters are so distant from reality that only a select few could find any connection, like Manhattan magnates surrounded by supermodels. For everyone else, it's a dull snooze fest, a stark reminder of the perils of being out of touch. Bogdanovich may entertain a small circle with his in-jokes, but for the majority, it's just a yawn-inducing experience.",
    "Revised Passage:\n\nI had the privilege of seeing some of my favorite stars from 30 years ago, such as John Ritter, Ben Gazzara, and Audrey Hepburn. They looked absolutely radiant on screen. However, their talents were unfortunately underutilized, as they were not given compelling characters or memorable lines to work with. The lack of depth in their roles left me disengaged and indifferent to their characters' actions.\n\nWhile some of the supporting female roles, like Patty Henson and Colleen Camp, showcased competence and confidence in their smaller parts, it's a pity they didn't receive more opportunities to shine in higher-quality films. I was also disappointed that Dorothy Stratten, in her only significant film role, didn't have the chance to fully demonstrate her acting abilities.\n\nDespite the film having its share of fans, I approached it with an open mind, being a devoted Peter Bogdanovich admirer who has enjoyed his past works, such as \"The Cat's Meow\" and his early classics like \"Targets\" and \"Nickelodeon.\" It was incredibly surprising to find that this particular film struggled to keep my attention, as I found myself fighting to stay awake throughout.\n\nAn interesting coincidence is the film's concept of detectives and clients becoming romantically entangled within a detective agency, which was later echoed in the hit television series \"Moonlighting\" starring Bogdanovich's former girlfriend, Cybill Shepherd. However, the series distinguished itself by relying on clever dialogue, unlike this film that attempted to rely on slapstick humor and a limited supply of witty lines.\n\nIn conclusion, this film falls short of the brilliance of \"Paper Moon\" and merely offers a pale imitation of the classic \"What's Up, Doc?\"",
    "Those who are praising this movie seem to be overlooking its flaws. While the actors and technical crew perform competently, the film is ultimately let down by a poor script. Fans of the actors mentioned should consider watching their other works instead.",
    "Avoid casting models and Playboy bunnies in your films. Bob Fosse's \"Star 80,\" based on Dorothy Stratten's tragic story, is far more captivating than Dorothy herself on screen. Patty Hansen also lacks acting skills – her performance fell short of expectations. The movie failed to live up to the standards set by acclaimed works like \"Paper Moon\" and \"The Last Picture Show.\" Despite speculation that its release was hindered by controversy surrounding Stratten's death, its poor quality seems to be the actual reason.",
    "The stellar cast and vibrant New York City backdrop captivate us, yet the movie's downfall lies in its lack of substance: a romance devoid of meaningful dialogue, mirroring the superficiality of Hollywood. Woody Allen himself couldn't outshine Bogdonovich's creation, but the script's absence leaves us with an empty, soulless film.",
    "I found the movie \"They All Laughed\" on a heavily discounted VHS tape at a rental store, initially drawn to it by the impressive names on the cover like Peter Bogdanovich, Audrey Hepburn, John Ritter, and Dorothy Stratten. The user rating on IMDb was 6.0, and it had received four stars in the \"Mick Martin & Marsha Porter Video & DVD Guide 2003.\" Despite the positive references, I ultimately found the movie to be overrated and quite boring. The characters were poorly developed, and the storyline failed to evoke any laughter. The coincidences in the plot were unbelievable, and some character portrayals were far-fetched, like Ben Gazarra's excessively alluring character. The only notable aspects were the presence of Dorothy Stratten, Patti Hansen, Audrey Hepburn, and the song \"Amigo\" by Roberto Carlos. I will only keep this movie in my collection for these highlights, primarily Dorothy Stratten. Overall, I rate it a four out of ten.",
    "This movie is extremely terrible with multiple flaws such as comedic mishaps by John Ritter, actors delivering lines poorly, inadequate editing, and problematic sound mixing. The plot lacks direction and fails to engage the audience. Shockingly, even Dorothy Stratten, known for her subpar acting, is not the worst in this film, with at least three other actors performing worse. Patti Hansen's delivery lacks emotion, resembling Ben Stein's monotone speech, making one question her inner vitality. Even the director's children perform poorly, with one clearly reading lines from cue cards. The film's overall quality is so low that Peter Bogdanovich faced difficulties securing another project for four years. It is strongly advised to avoid watching it at all costs. If it appears in your TV guide, consider canceling your cable subscription. If a friend suggests it, reassess your friendship, and if your partner wants to view it, it might be time to find a new companion. Enduring this film again is compared to gouging one's eyes out with lawn darts, emphasizing its unbearable nature. In short, the movie is a catastrophe of immense proportions.",
    "I bought this video because I was intrigued by Dorothy Stratten. While it featured wonderful actors and actresses, there were so many subplots that it was hard to stay engaged. Unfortunately, the dialogue was a bit stiff and confusing, and the story felt all over the place, making it less believable. I was a little let down by what I think was one of Audrey Hepburn's final films. However, John Ritter remains my favorite in slapstick comedy, although he seemed a bit out of place in this movie.",
    "I might film a movie next weekend, although I'm working. I'm quite certain I can manage to squeeze it in. The individual behind this movie must have similarly found a way. Hopefully, the creators of this production have alternate jobs because it was terrible! It resembles a homemade video, and I doubt they spent more than $100 creating it. Utter garbage! Who allows this kind of thing to be released?!",
    "Pros: None\n\nCons: Everything\n\nPlot summary: So, get this - a female reporter picks up a hitchhiker who starts rambling about people getting taken out by zombies.\n\nReview: Let me tell you, The Zombie Chronicles is hands down the worst movie I've ever seen. This disaster was clearly made on a shoestring budget – I'd be surprised if they even spent 20 bucks on it. The acting is beyond atrocious, the gore is distastefully over-the-top, and frankly, I'm baffled as to how this movie ever saw the light of day. Trust me, steer clear of The Zombie Chronicles like it's a contagious disease.\n\nMy take: Interestingly enough, this cinematic mess was brought to you by a studio called Brain Damage Films. Well, their brains must've been mush to greenlight a catastrophe like this.\n\nRating: 1 out of 10 (If it was my call, this garbage fire would get a negative bajillion)",
    "To the talented team behind \"Zombie Chronicles,\" if you're reading this, I've got some friendly advice coming your way: 😊🧟‍♂️\n\n1. Hey there! When crafting a \"Twist Ending\" flick, here's a hot tip - keep those close-ups of EVERY DEATH out of the opening credits! No spoilers, right? Let's keep those twists fresh and surprising!\n\n2. I applaud your creativity and resourcefulness in bringing this film to life on a shoestring budget. But hey, consider beefing up your cast with folks who can really deliver those lines with gusto. We need actors who can walk, talk, and emote all at once. (Yes, Joe Haggerty, looking at you!)\n\n3. Ah, time-traveling in films - an ambitious move! But if you're diving into the past, make sure you've got the right props and costumes to transport us there seamlessly.\n\n4. Ah, the art of the twist ending! It's all about the element of surprise, right? Keep us on our toes, but don't give away the big reveal too soon! Let that twist hit us like a speeding zombie - unexpected and thrilling.\n\nWhile I appreciate the effort, maybe this one's just for the die-hard zombie fans out there. Keep refining your craft, and who knows - your next project might just be a blockbuster hit! 🧟‍♂️💥🎬",
    "Movie watched on 8/3/2003 - Rated 2 out of 10. Directed by Brad Sykes. A mindless 3-D film featuring flesh-eating zombies in a three-part story. The film focuses more on showing zombies eating human flesh in 3D rather than developing a compelling storyline like the original zombie classics. The slow-paced and predictable finales make the movie boring. The final story, which revolves around a reporter investigating a ghost town, is lackluster. Skip this 3D film and watch the classics instead.",
    "There are many attractive women in this movie, but unfortunately, it does not feature any nudity. Strike one. \n\nMoving on, one of the storylines is set in 1971, so it's puzzling why the main characters are driving a modern Kia Sportage. It's a continuity error that stands out. \n\nThis film was released in stereoscopic 3D, but the 3D effects are poorly executed. The result is more like double-vision blurs rather than a true 3D experience. Even compared to the company's other 3D movies like HUNTING SEASON and CAMP BLOOD, the effects in this one fall short. \n\nOverall, this movie falls flat and doesn't offer much substance. On a positive note, the actress who portrayed the daughter of the ear-eating woman stood out. She has a captivating presence reminiscent of a young Janet Margolin.",
    "A female reporter encounters a peculiar hitch-hiker while on her way to a remote town that appears oddly close to a freeway. The hitch-hiker offers to guide her to her destination and shares two chilling tales related to the area: one involving an adulterous couple attacked by a zombie after plotting to kill the woman's husband, and another where campers disturb an undead outlaw's grave, cutting their vacation short. Although The Zombie Chronicles by Garrett Clancy and Brad Sykes aims to create a zombie-themed anthology, its limited content falls short. The film disappoints with poor acting, uninspired locations, a lackluster script, a non-nude sex scene, and a perplexing ending. Despite some effective camera work and enthusiastic gore effects, such as ear-biting, eyeball plucking, face removal, brain squishing, and decapitation, the movie is hard to endure even for fans of low-budget horror. I rate The Zombie Chronicles 2/10 but bump it up to 3 for the absence of 3D, although this likely wouldn't have drastically changed the viewing experience.",
    "Brad Sykes is behind two really boring and clichéd films I've seen - this one and Camp Blood. The acting is terrible, the quality is poor, and overall, this film is disappointing. It's like a challenge for us to make better zombie videos for YouTube. I paid £1 for this, but your time is more valuable than wasting it on this bad movie. It's best to steer clear of it, even at a low price.",
    "My girlfriend thought it would be funny to bring over The Zombie Chronicles for us to watch, but it turned out to be a regrettable decision as the movie was incredibly bad. While watching it, I made a mental list of activities I would have preferred to do instead, such as drinking bleach or doing tax returns. The film was full of mistakes and was deemed the worst I had ever seen, even worse than White Noise: The Light. The director, Garrett Clancy, also known as Sgt. Ben Draper, did not impress with his work. Even Owen Wilson reportedly attempted suicide after watching it. My girlfriend left the movie at my place, leaving me embarrassed to own such a terrible piece of cinema. In conclusion, I strongly advise against watching this film.",
    "Amateur, low-budget films can sometimes be surprisingly good, but unfortunately, this one falls short.\n\nThis movie, created by Brad Sykes, has poor acting overall, except for Emmy Smith who shows some potential. The camera work needs significant improvement, and the handheld camera running scenes are ineffective. The special effects lack creativity and are easily identifiable, which takes away from the realism. Additionally, there are issues with visible body parts during gory scenes. The scenery is dull and uninspiring, as seen in Sykes' other projects, and the music is a mix of cheap-sounding tunes reminiscent of adult films and poorly executed guitar-driven metal tracks.\n\nThe film lacks a coherent plot and character development, indicating a failure in the scriptwriting process. The lack of progression in Sykes' filmmaking skills is evident, as seen in his previous works. There is a plea to stop funding his projects due to their consistent poor quality.\n\nIt's clear that this film is not even worth watching casually, as even eating unpopped popcorn kernels would be preferable. One notable low point is the poorly executed military push-ups scene.\n\nAward: The worst ever military push-ups in a film.",
    "While not the most outstanding cinematic work, the film has intrigued me enough to view it twice. The storyline may have its shortcomings, as I found myself questioning its direction during the initial stages of the first short film. Nevertheless, I found the film strangely appealing, with its humor providing a source of entertainment.<br /><br />Jebidia's performance in the movie deserves acclaim, warranting consideration for an accolade such as an Oscar. However, his portrayal was slightly flawed by the discontinuation of his whimsical name-calling halfway through the movie.<br /><br />In conclusion, the film may be deemed somewhat lacking, yet it delivers moments of levity suitable for those seeking inexpensive amusement. If encountered at a reasonable price, such as at Poundland, it may be worth considering a purchase.",
    "Some movies you score for a pound can be surprisingly good - 23rd Century productions dropped a plethora of hidden gems from Italy and America that wowed audiences. Despite Hardgore releasing a few Fulci films and others, most of their releases are more like stinkers such as The Zombie Chronicles.<br /><br />The only saving grace of this film is that it's not as irritating as the Stink of Flesh. Otherwise, it's a clumsily made anthology with the technical quality of a Lego house built by a sea snail.<br /><br />This film has been criticized for showing too much action in the opening credits, leaving nothing to the imagination when the zombie attacks finally come. Bad movie aficionados will delight in spotting the 18,000 continuity errors and revel in the horrendous acting by the cast (especially the hitchhiker, who was so awful he managed to elicit a chuckle or two). Kudos to Hardgore for embracing the film's spirit by offering a print that feels like a worn-out home video from a camping trip.<br /><br />Absolutely dreadful. We've all produced something resembling this when we got our hands on a camera, but most of us had the sense to keep those projects hidden in the dark corners of our closets. Steer clear of this one.",
    "I received this movie as a gift and anticipated it would be bad based on the DVD cover. After more than a year of avoiding watching it, I finally did and found it to be quite disappointing. While I almost didn't finish the film due to its poor quality, I felt it was necessary to watch it completely before forming an opinion. To put it bluntly, the movie is terrible. It's surprising that such a poorly made film was even financed. It seems like it was produced on a very low budget, likely not exceeding $20,000, using basic equipment like a camcorder or cell phone camera, with amateur actors and a poorly written script.\n\nThe story follows a reporter named Tara Woodley who accidentally hits a man while on her way to report on a haunted town. The man is unharmed and they find a conveniently furnished abandoned house with a bottle of liquor on the doorstep. As they explore the house, the man begins telling Tara ghost and zombie stories, with one particularly absurd tale about a soldier named Sgt. Ben Draper. In this story, Sgt. Draper is responsible for the death of a soldier named Private Wilson, who rises from the grave as a zombie seeking revenge on those involved in his death. The twist ending of the story is unsatisfying.\n\nEven if you enjoy B-horror movies, it's best to steer clear of this film.",
    "I haven't watched many low-budget films, but this one is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. The main character, an elderly man, spoke as if he had undergone a lobotomy and could only utter one word every 5 seconds. A 5-year-old could have delivered a better performance. The storyline was incredibly awful, and the character playing the soldier attempted to be realistic but ended up going way overboard. I only continued watching to chuckle at the sheer terribleness of it all, hoping it would eventually improve. I can't believe this movie was even available for a 2-night rental at Blockbusters; it should have been a \"please take this for free and remove it from our store\" situation. I think there was one somewhat competent actor, aside from the female lead. The only decent aspect of the production was the makeup, but they gave away all the important scenes in the opening credits. Absolutely dreadful.",
    "This movie may not be suitable for typical film enthusiasts as it lacks clarity and consistency in its storyline. The abrupt shifts in time periods, poor acting, and reliance on 3D effects for attention make it more of a B-movie or \"bad movie\" choice. If you prefer films by Goddard and Antonioni, this movie is not recommended.",
    "You can't help but admire Brad Sykes, a man who keeps cranking out low-budget horror movies despite receiving less-than-enthusiastic reactions. He soldiers on, relentless and determined. Even the faint praise for his Camp Blood films is begrudgingly given, and I'm just as guilty of it as anyone else. Despite his limitations, Brad always manages to inject something intriguing into his work - a unique concept, a quirky character, among other things. With minimal resources, he relies on the audience to understand and appreciate his vision for what it is and what it could potentially become.\n\nJoe Haggerty delivers a lively and comical performance as Ebenezer Jackson, and it's a testament to Sykes' intuition that he recognized this eccentric portrayal would fit seamlessly into the film's framework. Coming soon to a theater near you - at least in a parallel universe!",
    "Summary: In the movie \"The Zombie Chronicles,\" a young reporter goes on a quest to find a ghost town and encounters a hitchhiker who shares two stories about zombies. However, the film is criticized for having amateurish acting, routine storytelling, and lackluster direction. The 3-D format is also deemed as a wasted opportunity.",
    "A woman seeks directions to a mysterious town and is told two zombie stories by a local weirdo. However, \"The Zombie Chronicles\" film is terrible, with inappropriate scenes, amateur acting, and poor quality. It is filled with dull moments, lacks zombie action, and looks outdated, filmed like a low-budget YouTube video from the 70s. Save yourself the torture and avoid this laughable horror movie. Rating: 0/10.",
    "I am astonished that I ended up spending $5 on the movie. As a dedicated fan of zombies, I had high hopes that the movie would be worth the watch. However, to my disappointment, it turned out to be a complete letdown. While the movie did have some redeeming moments, such as the intense scene where a character's head was violently torn off, there wasn't much else to capture my interest. Overall, I would rather subject myself to sliding down a razorblade slide with bare skin into a vat of vinegar than endure watching this movie again.\n\nIf there had been some gratuitous nudity included, it might have helped salvage the viewing experience, but alas, I had to resort to checking out the previews of other films produced by the same company for that. In conclusion, potential buyers should be cautious unless they have a peculiar inclination towards enjoying pain and suffering.",
    "I viewed this film approximately three years ago, which continues to stand out in my memory as the epitome of the worst cinematic creation ever produced. The viewing experience was so dismal that I doubt I even managed to endure it until the end. This film is of inferior quality, equivalent to a homemade video fashioned by an amateur high school student. Notably, there was a scene within this film attempting to depict the 1970s era, featuring a character clad in a polo shirt and Oakley sunglasses driving what seemed to be a relatively modern SUV, possibly a Toyota Rav-4. The nonsensical portrayal of this character, potentially equipped with a cell phone, further solidifies the ineptitude of the production. The sheer absurdity of such an inaccurate representation left me flabbergasted. Subsequently, I promptly returned the film to the video store, questioning the rationale behind stocking such a subpar creation and inquiring if it was possible to reclaim the valuable hour wasted on viewing it. To date, this film remains etched in my mind as the ultimate testament to a cinematic failure, surpassing the numerous lackluster creations that have crossed my path.",
    "I was quite disappointed with Love's Abiding Joy, which I had been eagerly anticipating. Upon watching it during its recent airing on Hallmark, I found it to be quite different from what I expected. The film was rather somber and filled with numerous mistakes. The editing was subpar, with many scenes feeling out of place. The premature death of baby Kathy and Clark's presence seemed out of sync. The actors appeared lackluster, lacking emotional depth, and there was a notable absence of interaction between Missie and Willie.\n\nIn my opinion, the scriptwriters should have adhered more closely to the source material. It appears that each movie strays further from Janette Oke's original writings. The film omitted crucial elements from the book, such as the mine incident involving the two boys and Clark's injury. I believe the reactions of Missie and Willie to Kathy's death should have been portrayed rather than just mentioned.\n\nAmong the four movies produced thus far, Love's Abiding Joy ranks as my least favorite. For future installments, I hope there will be a more faithful adaptation from the books. If Clark's character reappears, I wish for a more significant role with greater depth. I also anticipate more screen time for Scottie, Cookie, and possibly Marty. However, the direction of the upcoming films remains uncertain, and we can only wait to see what the scriptwriters have in store.",
    "The movie \"Love's Abiding Joy\" strays far from the original book, lacking accurate character details and storyline. It does a disservice to Janette Oke, her fans, and her work. The music is too loud, and the actors lack emotion. It may work as a clean family movie, but not as an adaptation of the book. It is hoped that future movies in the series will stay closer to the original plot and storyline for a more faithful adaptation.",
    "I was really looking forward to this movie! It's a nice family flick, but I think if Michael Landon Jr.'s editing team stepped up their game, the movie could be even better. There were too many scenes that felt out of place. I'm hoping there's another movie in the series because I've enjoyed them all so far. But if they do make another one, please, please pay more attention to the editing. The storyline felt all over the place and lacking focus, which is a shame because the previous movies in the series were fantastic. I love the characters Willie and Missy; they're such strong role models. And who doesn't love a good love story, right?",
    "I have read all the Love Come Softly books, and I was highly disappointed in the movie adaptation. The only similarity with the book is that Missy's father visits, unlike the book where both parents come. The movie's storyline was far-fetched and too sad compared to the book. The overall tone of the movie was bleak, even for a pioneer life setting. The film receives some credit for maintaining the family-oriented theme seen in the books, but it did not capture the essence of the original story.",
    "\"Despite my deep appreciation for Christian movies, I must say that \"Love's Abiding Joy\" falls short of my expectations. It's clear that there is a passion for depicting Christian themes on screen, and while I applaud the effort, the execution in this particular film lacks a certain polish. The storyline is somewhat predictable, the performances are passable, and the editing could use some work. While it may have its place as a TV movie, as a feature film it leaves much to be desired. I encourage filmmakers to continue exploring the world of Christian cinema, perhaps drawing inspiration from literary giants like G. K. Chesterton or C. S. Lewis. There's great potential here, so keep pushing boundaries and striving for excellence!\"",
    "As a child, I found the weapon brandished by the murderer to be fascinating, despite my naivety back then. Even in my youthful ignorance, I couldn't help but feel that the movie's plot was lackluster and unengaging whenever the killer wasn't utilizing his signature light knife to dispatch victims. It's perplexing to see such a formidable cast involved in a production that seems to revolve solely around showcasing a miniature lightsaber. The narrative is often convoluted, culminating in a chaotic and incomprehensible ending that centers on extraterrestrial beings and the enigmatic weapon.\n\nThe story follows two youngsters and an individual who have an encounter with aliens, only to have the mysterious weapon resurface years later, triggering a series of bizarre events that involve the weapon being used for a seemingly benign killing spree. The film begs the question of its purpose, failing to deliver on impactful death scenes, elaborate alien encounters, or fully embracing its light saber theme akin to the iconic \"Star Wars\" franchise.",
    "The movie is about a woman named Jill Dunne, who is dealing with a disrespectful daughter named Liv and a deceitful husband named Sean. The family is targeted by a killer during a storm. However, most of the film focuses on Jill arguing with Liv and dealing with Sean's behavior. As the story progresses, Jill discovers Sean's infidelity, but their marital issues are unresolved. Eventually, the family goes on a camping trip, leading to more conflict. Despite the thrilling premise, the suspenseful moments are minimal until the end.",
    "This movie was terrible. The acting, plot, and premise were all awful. Skip it, don't waste your time.",
    "Lifetime has missed the mark once again with their latest production. The plot was nonsensical, the acting was subpar - particularly from the teenage actors, and the storyline felt overused and tired. Despite promising previews, this supposed thriller fell flat. Although Lifetime occasionally delivers good movies, this certainly wasn't one of them. I recommend steering clear of this film unless you have absolutely nothing else to do. Personally, I felt like I wasted two hours of my life watching it. I'd rather spend that time scraping my face against a brick wall and then soaking it in peroxide - at least that would be more entertaining!",
    "I must admit, I was genuinely taken aback by the high ratings this movie received. To me, it felt entirely nonsensical. I mean, the idea that the mother suddenly develops \"visions\" by touching random things or people? And then, touching something twice makes the vision persist... It all just felt incredibly absurd. Deedee Pfieffer's performance was particularly lacking, in my opinion. Her portrayal was quite grating. On a positive note, the girl who played Lori delivered a solid performance, as did most of the supporting cast, given the material they had to work with.<br /><br />As a fan of LMN, I usually have a very broad taste when it comes to movies, but this one seemed to push the boundaries of believability with its outlandish plot and exaggerated acting. Ultimately, it simply didn't resonate with me.",
    "The original book was based in the 1950s, but for the TV series, it was transformed to embody the 1930s style that most viewers prefer. Interestingly, the tube train near the end was a clever disguise - a 1950s train made to appear like a 1930s train, allowing the Underground to participate in the era's aesthetic. While the storyline revolving around the Jarrow March felt weak, the inclusion of students grappling with social issues added depth. The portrayal of Japp needing to fend for himself was lackluster, serving as mere filler. This episode could have been a compelling half-hour show or a more engaging long-form series if they had stuck closer to the original book. Ultimately, this episode falls victim to prioritizing style over substance.",
    "The repetitive use of the annoying mouse and lullaby was unnecessary and seemed amateurish, much like something from my early days in film school. The story felt dragged out with too many irrelevant elements, giving the impression that the creative team lacked direction or could have benefited from a shorter format. After binge-watching all the episodes up to this point in a week, I must warn others that this was the weakest one and suggest starting elsewhere.",
    "I watched this movie on its opening weekend in Australia, excited to see a great cast including Ledger, Edgerton, Bloom, Watts, and Rush telling the story of Ned Kelly. Unfortunately, even though Heath Ledger delivered an outstanding performance as the lead, the storyline was quite weak. This doesn't make me eager to read \"Our Sunshine.\" There were some positives though, like Edgerton's supporting acting, Jordan's solid direction (which he also showed in Buffalo Soldiers), and the realistic production design of the Australian bush. However, it feels like a missed opportunity to truly capture the essence of this Australian legend, possibly due to trying to cater to Hollywood and the US audience. I'm glad they didn't compromise on the authenticity of the beards just to please Universal though.<br /><br />I guess I'll have to settle for reading Peter Carey's fantastic novel \"Secret History of the Kelly Gang\" instead. I'd rate the movie 4 out of 10.",
    "I witnessed this during its premiere in Melbourne. \n\nThe film is deemed to be lacking depth and fails to leave a lasting impact. Despite having competent actors, they were hindered by a slow-paced and unimpressive screenplay. The narrative lacks substantial literary qualities and solely thrives on conventional characterizations. Regrettably, it falls short of being an entertaining popcorn flick due to its uneven pacing and subpar execution. \n\nIt is improbable that Gregor Jordan could reflect and acknowledge that he maximized the potential of the source material. \n\nNed Kelly remains a captivating historical figure, with a complex significance in Australian folklore. While seen as a potential folk hero, social crusader, and possibly a disturbed individual, Ned Kelly has maintained a prominent position in Australian folklore for more than a century. Once again, his cinematic portrayal has failed to resonate effectively. \n\nSuch is the nature of life.",
    "Ned Kelly (Ledger), an infamous Australian outlaw, is depicted in the movie as a mix of Robin Hood and Billy the Kid, known for rebelling against English aristocratic oppression. The film portrays a romanticized version of history, emphasizing legends over facts. Despite a slow-paced plot, the performances and direction fall short, with exaggerated accents and unconvincing storytelling. The excessive nature shots and irrelevant scenes make it a tedious watch, rendering it a forgettable historical drama better suited for television.",
    "They created a fantasy film reminiscent of \"Man From Snowy River\" and \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,\" featuring Ned and Joe getting involved with wealthy older men's wives. Despite the many myths about Ned Kelly, there are well-documented facts that leave room for artistic interpretation. This story is not a legend lost in time but rather a recent historical event. The movie failed to do justice to the true Kelly story, unlike Peter Carey's novel \"The True History of the Kelly Gang.\" Surprisingly, Mick Jagger's 1970 portrayal was perhaps more accurate and a better film overall. A disappointing watch, but at least it was only a two-dollar rental. I'd rate it 3/10, mostly for the scenic shots of the Australian outback.",
    "This movie was extremely disappointing. Heath Ledger and Orlando Bloom, who are thought to be heartthrobs, did not meet expectations. Rachel Griffiths was great as usual, but Geoffrey Rush's performance seemed lacking. The film failed to engage the audience and was filled with clichés, making it a tedious watch. The final scenes, which were meant to be serious, ended up being unintentionally funny. Overall, the film was a waste of time, leaving many viewers dissatisfied with their experience.",
    "Ned Kelly could be called an \"Australian Western\" if the term made sense. He was seen as a heroic outlaw similar to Robin Hood and other famous bandits. Kelly, an Irish immigrant, became a fugitive and outlaw after being wrongly accused of shooting an Australian law officer. In retaliation, he and his group robbed banks to protest the mistreatment of Irish immigrants in Australia.\n\nThe movie \"Ned Kelly\" follows the typical storyline of a sympathetic outlaw facing off against authorities. It includes clichés like the good-hearted criminal and a romanticized portrayal of robbery. While the film tries to depict Ned Kelly as a hero, it falls short due to a lackluster performance by Heath Ledger and a preachy narration.\n\nOverall, \"Ned Kelly\" may be informative about Australian history, but it's essentially a rehash of familiar themes with an Australian setting.",
    "This movie was incredibly disappointing; it felt like a project put together by inexperienced junior high students trying their hand at filmmaking. The lack of coherence in directing, editing, production, and scripting made it hard to believe what I was watching. Critical elements such as narrative flow, character development, and emotional arcs were poorly executed, leaving scenes feeling disconnected and relationships lacking depth. Despite some decent acting, the subpar writing overshadowed the performances. The film resembled a low-quality TV western, failing to properly capture the intriguing true story it aimed to tell. While some may argue its significance to Australians due to the subject matter, the overall quality of the movie remains deficient. Just because a historical figure like Ned Kelly is important doesn't automatically make the movie good. It falls short on all fronts, except for the attractive leads played by Heath Ledger and Orlando Bloom.",
    "This movie skipped theaters in our area, but once it hit DVD, I eagerly grabbed a copy. However, I quickly realized I should have heeded the critics' warnings and given it a pass! 💥 Despite the star-studded cast, the film was a major letdown - no wonder it went straight to video. 😔 I had high hopes with Bloom, Ledger, and Rush on board, as they've all delivered stellar performances in the past. But sadly, the movie was a slow burn that failed to capture my interest. I struggled to connect with the characters and found myself tempted to fast-forward just to reach the end. 🎬 I wouldn't recommend this film, not even for a dose of 'eye candy' - it falls short on every front. 👎",
    "Key points emphasized:\n\nThis version of a famous Australian story lacks engagement and feels forced and mechanical. The actors Heath Ledger and Orlando Bloom give their characters personality. However, the beginning could have been more captivating by starting with a shootout and incorporating flashbacks. Every scene felt predictably signposted, resembling a bad TV soap. Despite high expectations, the movie falls short, only slightly surpassing the Mick Jagger version.",
    "The Ned Kelly saga holds great relevance for Australians, yet this film is utterly disappointing. Despite being an Australian narrative, it feels strangely transplanted to an American setting. Furthermore, Ned Kelly, an iconic Australian figure, inexplicably possesses an Irish accent in this film. Overall, this movie ranks as the most dreadful I have watched in a considerable amount of time.",
    "Right from the start, this film boldly presents a heavy-handed political narrative that leaves little room for surprises. Unlike the well-advised approach of crafting layered characters with evolving arcs in three acts, this film opts for a simplistic portrayal. The police are portrayed as shallow, inept antagonists, devoid of any depth or nobility one might expect. Rather than exploring the complexities of Ned Kelly's character, the film rushes into scenes without offering insight into his true nature. The constant solemn gazes from Ned Kelly towards the camera, coupled with the uninspiring direction, made viewing this film a tedious task that discouraged further engagement with modern cinema.",
    "I was drawn to this movie because of the intriguing storyline and the talented lead actor, so I decided to give it a try. Directed by Gregor Jordan (Buffalo Soldiers), the film follows Ned Kelly (played by Heath Ledger) who is framed by the police, led by Superintendent Francis Hare (Geoffrey Rush). Kelly is forced to flee, form a gang, and confront the authorities to clear his name and protect his family. Although I wasn't fully engaged while watching, I can share that the cast includes Orlando Bloom as Joseph Byrne, Naomi Watts as Julia Cook, and other actors such as Laurence Kinlan, Philip Barantini, Joel Edgerton, Kiri Paramore, Kerry Condon, Emily Browning, and Rachel Griffiths. Ledger delivers a solid performance, and there are some visually striking moments in the film, notably a gun battle towards the climax. However, my lack of full attention prevented me from fully enjoying the movie.",
    "I didn't understand the rating for The Amati Girls and I was being generous by giving it a 4 out of 10. What could have been a nice story with decent actors turned out to be a total mess in my opinion. The movie is full of clichés, bad hair, and unrealistic scenes. The actors seem to be overdoing it without any real passion. It's not funny enough to be a comedy and too artificial to evoke any real emotion. I couldn't believe I was watching it on my TV in Switzerland. Maybe it just didn't translate well? Overall, it's one of the weirdest movies I've seen, and not in a good way. I'm sorry.",
    "The movie was terrible, especially the ending. It lacked a coherent plot, and the only redeeming quality was the exceptional performances by Robert DuVall and James Earl Jones. However, their talents were not showcased well due to the weak script. Despite their remarkable acting, the movie failed to deliver a compelling storyline. The characters were unremarkable, with the exception of DuVall's portrayal of a disoriented old man. The entire film felt aimless, with no significant events or developments. After enduring the entire film, it was evident that it offered no meaningful plot or depth. The story unfolded over just one day on a Southern plantation, limiting the potential for a compelling narrative. Despite the strong performances by the cast, the film ultimately fell short of being a worthwhile watch.",
    "Oh man, that movie was terrible! The performances were decent, but there was no plot at all. It was just a bunch of clowns chatting about random stuff. Robert Duvall's character was so annoying, asking the same questions repeatedly. The film only got a pass because of the famous actors in it. Overall, it was a complete mess. Nothing really happened - total waste of time!",
    "SWING! is a significant film as it stands out as one of the few Black-produced and enacted movies surviving from the 1930s. While many films from that era have deteriorated beyond watchability, SWING! is a commendable exception, preserved in fairly good condition. It offers a delightful opportunity to witness the talents of numerous Black performers post the peak of the old Cotton Club era, a time often overlooked today.\n\nHowever, despite its historical importance and noteworthy performances, SWING! falls short in many areas. The main plot closely resembles the typical Hollywood musicals of its time, featuring a troublesome prima donna set on sabotaging the show, and an unknown individual who miraculously saves the day. Nevertheless, the screenplay is poorly crafted and occasionally descends into trashiness, projecting derogatory images of Black America that may cause offense. The introduction of a lazy husband living off his hardworking wife, paired with exaggerated performances, sets an unsavory tone. The film further falters with scenes reminiscent of WWE Smackdown and an appalling instance of domestic violence applauded by the crowd.\n\nDespite these flaws, if you can overlook its subpar production quality, poorly developed characters, amateur acting, and weak direction, SWING! might still hold some value. It presents remarkable singing and tap dancing performances and offers a window into a forgotten facet of Black culture. Proceed with caution, though, as the acting is truly cringe-worthy!",
    "\"The Sunshine Boys\" is a comedy adapted by Neil Simon, where old age is depicted as irrational and mean-spirited behavior. Walter Matthau portrays an aged vaudeville performer convinced to reunite with former partner George Burns for a television special. Despite Burns entering the film after about thirty minutes, Matthau's performance overshadows the material. The film becomes increasingly noisy and less enjoyable, with director Herbert Ross failing to deliver successful gags. Matthau, although too young for the role, exaggerates his performance. The film lacks brightness and moves slowly, leading to early disappointment.",
    "I bought the film \"Protocol\" starring Goldie Hawn at Walmart for $5.50, hoping for another great movie from her. However, while mildly amusing, the film never truly finds its rhythm. Certain scenes, like a drawn-out party scene in a bar, feel unnecessary and drag on for too long. The preachy scene at the end of the film leaves a bad taste in my mouth, as I believe it added little to the overall movie. I'm not a fan of comedies that try to teach lessons, especially when written by someone stuck in the '60s! In the end, although I'm happy to add another Goldie Hawn film to my collection, I question if it was truly worth the money spent.",
    "\"Get ready for a rollercoaster ride with Protocol, a movie that may surprise you! Featuring the legendary Goldie Hawn and a stellar cast, this film follows the journey of a quirky cocktail waitress who finds herself thrust into the limelight after a chance encounter with an Arab dignitary. While the plot may take a surprising turn halfway through, Goldie's infectious charm continues to shine. If you're a fan of Goldie Hawn or just looking for some entertainment, Protocol is worth a watch!\"",
    "The role of an \"Executive Producer\" in a movie typically involves securing financial backing for the film. In many movies starring Sean Connery, he also serves as the executive producer, indicating his involvement in raising funds due to his significant influence in the industry. However, when the executive producer is also the star of the movie, it often suggests that the film is primarily a platform to showcase that star, rather than focusing on a strong storyline or screenplay.\n\nIn the case of the movie \"PROTOCOL,\" the story follows Sunny Davis, a quirky cocktail waitress who becomes a diplomat after saving a dignitary. As the plot unfolds, Davis faces increasingly improbable situations. The fact that Goldie Hawn stars in and executive produces the film further emphasizes the concern that the story and screenplay may not meet the desired standards.",
    "Unbelievable concept lacking credibility and failing to generate humor or engage viewers. It is Goldie Hawn's likability alone that saves it from total failure. Goldie's impressive career has thrived despite a lack of quality material.",
    "There are only two movies that deserve a 1/10 rating in my book: this disaster and \"The Man who Fell to Earth.\" I vividly recall watching Protocol at a packed theater in the early 80s during my high school days. The screenplay is so mind-numbingly dull that it insults the intelligence of anyone (even a high school student). It completely lost me with its attempt at humor involving someone getting shot in the rear end. Goldie Hawn's character is supposed to be charming but instead comes off as vacuous and foolish. The film shamelessly perpetuates offensive stereotypes about Arabs, only for Goldie to win the audience over with populist nonsense. The performances are abysmal, including Goldie Hawn's. I swore off watching any of her movies until, in my opinion, she redeemed herself in Everyone Says I Love You. Protocol represents laziness in screenplay writing at its peak. It's simply the worst kind of movie - one that requires little to no effort to make.",
    "One memorable scene from this movie features Goldie Hawn standing in a French-cut bikini, playfully fending off other women as they try to remove her cotton top. This scene made quite an impression on me when I first saw it at fourteen. I recently came across it on TV, where they blurred her midsection, but it served as a reminder of Goldie Hawn's allure in the '80s. Kurt Russell must have had an exciting time being with her.",
    "The writer discovered the Catalan-language film \"El Mar\" at an art-house video store and although appreciating its technical aspects and cinematography, was ultimately unsettled by the graphic content and found some of the characters and their actions bewildering. The story follows three children who survived a violent incident and reunite as adults, with one becoming a nun and the others as tuberculosis patients. The film features excessive violence and dark themes reminiscent of older exploitation movies, with characters' motivations and interactions often feeling disjointed. The reviewer suggests that the film lacks sufficient character development and may not appeal to those seeking a coherent and uplifting narrative. Additionally, it is noted that the film uses the Mallorqui dialect of Catalan, distinct from the Barcelona dialect, with even native Barcelonans possibly requiring subtitles to understand certain parts of the dialogue.",
    "I eagerly anticipated watching a Cataluña's film in the Berlin competition. However, after the screening, I was completely disappointed and furious! The film was a chaotic mix of excessive blood, prolonged runtime, and meaningless themes. While it explored aspects like the Spanish Civil War and human revenge – familiar subjects in many films and plays, the portrayal was lackluster. Mr. Villaronga's attempt at a pseudo-tragedy falls flat and does a disservice to the history of cinema. It's disheartening to see Angela Molina in such a production. My recommendation is to steer clear of this film at all costs!",
    "This film was a major letdown due to its disturbingly high levels of cruelty, violence, and mean-spiritedness. The characters were unsympathetic, with the lead protagonist being particularly slimy. The over-the-top theatrics in the sickroom/house atmosphere left little room for a meaningful exploration of the Spanish civil war. The portrayal of same-sex attraction as a lurid \"horror\" was offensive and poorly executed. The actors appeared uncomfortable in their roles, seemingly trying to distance themselves from the film. Overall, the film relies on brutal scenes of violence against children and pets, making it a potentially appealing choice only for those who enjoy such content.",
    "A three-part \"horror\" film unfolds within the confines of a boarded-up house, as an unknown individual pleads with viewers to avoid venturing \"out there.\" Regrettably, the narrative weaves three tales to substantiate the warning.\n\nIn the initial segment, a young couple entwines with two deranged individuals following a car accident, culminating in two unsurprising plot twists. Despite its brevity (clocking in at approximately 15 minutes), the sequence proves to be swift, brutal, and skillfully executed. While its predictability is evident, the overall experience remains engaging.\n\nThe subsequent storyline centers on a man fleeing with ill-gotten gains, only to face a series of unfortunate events when his vehicle malfunctions, leading him to a local medical facility where danger lurks. The execution is glaringly overt, poorly developed, and frustratingly slow-paced, stretching to an arduous 30-minute runtime. Notably, commendable performances elevate an otherwise lackluster narrative.\n\nLastly, a narrative that teeters on the edge of horror unfolds, following an enchanting yet solitary woman in pursuit of her ideal partner. Displaying lavish set designs, an evocative atmosphere, and a sensuous interlude, the plot maintains an aura of beauty but lacks genuine fright. Once more, the outcome unfolds predictably without instilling a sense of unease.\n\nUltimately, the film concludes in an unsatisfactory manner. While the initial segment offers some semblance of entertainment value, the remainder falls short. Viewers are advised to focus on the first story and subsequently disengage from the film.",
    "- A very cheesy and dull road movie intended to be hip and modern, but only resulting in sleepiness.\n- The cast is wasted, the writing is stupid and pretentious.\n- The only highlights are the top-notch Lalo Schifrin's soundtrack and the original opening sequence.\n- Overall, the bad opinions and comments about this flick are totally deserved; it is really pure garbage.",
    "The film has nice cinematography, but lacks subtitles for key plot points, leaving non-Spanish speakers confused. Matthew McConaughey has a minor role despite being marketed as a star. Patrick McGaw shines as the lead actor. \"Scorpion Spring\" is worth watching but doesn't stand out. Recommended McConaughey films include \"A Time to Kill,\" \"The Newton Boys,\" \"Frailty,\" \"How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days,\" \"Edtv,\" and \"Amistad.\" Avoid \"Larger Than Life\" and \"Angels in the Outfield\" unless looking for children's movies.",
    "I have been searching for this film for a long time as it is considered rare due to being part of the video nasties. Finally, towards the end of last year, I found it on DVD. It is a low-budget movie set in the Amazon jungle, focusing on tribes living in fear of the devil. The story follows Laura Crawford, a model who gets kidnapped by a gang of thugs while working in South America. They take her into the jungle, where she is guarded by a native man who refers to himself as \"The Devil\". Laura undergoes various unpleasant experiences until her captors are satisfied – with maidens being chained up and the devil illustrating gruesome acts like consuming flesh. Peter Weston, a devil hunter, ventures into the jungle to attempt to rescue her.",
    "As I near the end of my Video Nasties list, I came across this terrible film about a kidnapped fashion model in the jungle with bad acting, dubbed voices, and gratuitous nudity, including explicit close-ups. It also features a poorly made-up cannibal cult leader. Not recommended unless you're a die-hard Video Nasties fan, and even then, save it for last - it's not representative of the list's quality.",
    "I'm uncertain whether my opinion is directed towards those who branded this movie as a video nasty or towards the director, but \"Devil Hunter\" is undeniably a peculiar 'horror' film. The storyline loosely mirrors esteemed movies like \"Cannibal Ferox\" and \"Cut and Run.\" It follows the abduction of a woman in a 'jungle' by a 'tribe' of 'savages', yet the jungle resembles more of a park in Mexico. The tribe appears more like hippies dressed in Party City-esque Halloween outfits imitating tribal attire. The savages display a range of ethnicities, from white to Asian, black, and Hispanic, suggesting a lack of cohesive casting. Adding to its faults, the movie is notably deficient in gore, lacking genuine scares, and gratuitously includes unnecessary male nudity. Unfortunately, there was little to enjoy in this production, falling significantly short of expectations, earning a disappointing rating of 2 out of 10.",
    "This controversial film was initially prohibited in Britain but was eventually approved in November without any edits.<br /><br />\nIt stars Ursula Buchfellner, the Playboy Playmate of the Month for October 1979. The beginning alternates between Buchfellner and misty jungle scenes, leaving the purpose unclear. Emphasizing the bathtub sequence would have been more effective.<br /><br />\nThe plot follows Laura (played by Buchfellner), who gets kidnapped and held captive in the jungle for ransom. Peter (Al Cliver - known for \"The Beyond\" and \"Zombie\") is assigned to rescue her and the ransom money. During this time, one of the kidnappers (Antonio de Cabo) makes the most of his time, while another (Werner Pochath) complains incessantly.<br /><br />\nThe ransom handover ends disastrously, and Laura escapes into the jungle. Can Peter reach her before the cannibals make her their next meal? Yes, there are cannibals in this story, which explains why it was considered controversial. Muriel Montossé is discovered by Peter and his partner (Antonio Mayans - \"Angel of Death\") aboard the kidnappers' vessel, provocatively undressed. Peter leaves them and sets out alone to find Laura, who has already been captured. Ignoring the approaching danger, they engage in intimate activities. Expect visceral scenes such as a brutal fight between Peter and the nude antagonist (Burt Altman).<br /><br />\nThis film doesn't hold back on gore, including blood, decapitation, and intestines. It also features abundant nudity, captivating gyrations by the cannibal priestess (Aline Mess), and the memorable line, \"They tore her heart out,\" which will only make sense once you watch the movie.",
    "Among the three Jess Franco titles that made it to the Official DPP Video Nasty list - Devil Hunter, Bloody Moon, and Women Behind Bars - this is perhaps the least deserving of infamy. It is a dreadfully dull jungle adventure with hints of gore, a disturbing rape scene, and plenty of nudity sprinkled in for good measure.<br /><br />Stunning blonde Ursula Buchfellner portrays Laura Crawford, a famous actress who is kidnapped by a ruthless gang and brought to a remote tropical island governed by a tribe that worships a menacing 'devil god' hidden in the jungle. This deity has a penchant for consuming the hearts of young female sacrifices.<br /><br />Hired to deliver a $6 million ransom, the brave mercenary Peter Weston (played by Al Cliver) along with his pilot friend, a Vietnam veteran, journey to the island. However, complications arise when the villains attempt to betray them. Amidst the chaos, Laura manages to escape into the wilderness but unwittingly falls into the clutches of the island's tribal inhabitants, who offer her as a sacrifice.<br /><br />Directed by Franco in his characteristic slow-paced manner, this absurd film is laden with his trademark elements: shoddy special effects, murky cinematography, hasty zoom-ins, ample crotch shots, blurry visuals, poor sound effects, and clumsy editing. The outcome is a chaotic disaster that proves to be an arduous watch from beginning to end (I had to endure it over several viewings), with even the captivating Buchfellner failing to salvage the film's appeal.",
    "A surefire sign that a horror movie is subpar can be pinpointed when it elicits uncontrollable laughter. Admittedly, the core storyline has already been dissected by numerous critics, so I will delve into the comedic aspects it presents.\n\nVarious sources have attempted to pinpoint the movie's location, suggesting places such as South America, Africa, or even a nondescript Pacific island. The setting remains shrouded in mystery. The cannibal tribe, oddly composed of a few black women, black men, and a drummer reminiscent of a youthful Frank Zappa, is overseen by a massive black man afflicted with severe pink eye.\n\nOne of the most bizarre sequences unfolds when \"Pablito\" discovers his partner hanging from a tree, drenched in what appears to be an orange-hued substance assumed to be blood. As \"Pablito\" shrieks incessantly (an unintentionally comical moment), his partner's head tumbles to the ground. To everyone's surprise, \"Pablito\" proceeds to playfully nudge it – an action that seems to serve his amusement. Astonishingly, the eyes within the dislocated head exhibit movement, a surreal and perplexing twist.\n\nHowever, any semblance of fear or unease dissipates once it becomes evident that these peculiar occurrences are merely a byproduct of the movie's poor execution. This viewing experience engenders genuine, long-unheard guffaws, making it a delightful selection for a leisurely Sunday gathering with friends and idle minds. Stock up on some refreshing beverages, cue up this film, and prepare for a truly enjoyable time! In the pursuit of genuine horror or visceral thrills, though, you may want to look elsewhere.",
    "A film actress shooting a film in Africa is abducted and taken to the jungle for ransom. The producer hires someone to rescue her, but complications arise due to the presence of cannibals in the area who worship an unattractive \"god\" that preys on naked women.\n\nThis gory and sleazy movie is filled with excessive nudity, violence, and exploitation, catering to the darkest aspects of human nature. Despite the graphic content, including violent and sexual abuse, as well as a monstrous deity, the film falls flat due to its dullness and disjointed plot. The lack of dialogue and slow pacing make it a tedious watch, with the only significant sound being the victims' screams.\n\nThis movie is best avoided unless you are looking for a sleep aid or have a particular interest in Euro-cannibal films.",
    "This film tells the story of film starlet Laura Crawford being kidnapped by a group demanding a $6 million ransom. Vietnam vet Peter Weston is hired to rescue her, leading to unexpected encounters with a local tribe known for sacrificing young women to a cannibal god. Featuring entertaining elements such as a humorous dub track and a goofy monster with bulging eyes, the movie also includes a strong EuroCult supporting cast. Despite its excessive runtime of 1 hour and 40 minutes, the film offers plenty of nudity, gore, and a memorable fistfight between the main characters. While the Severin DVD generally looks good, there are some issues with ghosting images and untranslated Spanish dialogue. Director Jess Franco provides insights in a 16-minute interview included on the DVD.",
    "Devil Hunter became infamous for being on the DPP 'Video Nasty' list, but in all honesty, it didn't deserve the attention. While some films on the list were there for unknown reasons, this one wasn't exactly a standout in terms of being outrageous. It's not the most mellow film, but it's not exactly the most ban-worthy either. Personally, I wouldn't have bothered watching it if it weren't for its notorious status.\n\nThe story sets a decent foundation for the film, especially compared to most cannibal movies out there. It follows an actress who gets kidnapped and taken into the Amazon jungle. A hunter is then hired to rescue her, facing off against the natives led by a man who goes by \"The Devil,\" hence the title. The movie just kind of goes on for eighty-five minutes without offering many captivating scenes.\n\nIt's a shame that a talented director like Jess Franco ended up making films like this. He's proven his skill in movies such as The Diabolical Dr Z, Venus in Furs, Faceless, and She Kills in Ecstasy. Sadly, Devil Hunter is more of a miss in his filmography. I watched it mainly to complete my viewing of all the DPP's list films (just two more to go!), and I assume that's the motivation for many others who have seen it. However, if you're not into hunting down controversial movies, there's really no need to waste your time on this one.",
    "This movie felt excessively long despite only being 75 minutes because of the extended scenes of characters walking through various jungle locations to fill up time. A highlight of the film is the comical and unclothed native zombie with large, bloody eyes, whose appearance is emphasized by heavy breathing and echoing sounds on the soundtrack. Fans of European exploitation films will find enjoyment in the poorly dubbed dialogue, excessive female nudity, and exaggerated makeup on the monsters and native characters. While lacking in gore for a zombie/cannibal movie, it is possible that I watched a censored version.",
    "This movie is poorly made with a low budget and bad acting. Furthermore, the plot is nonsensical. A man who consumes women, especially non-virgins? It's absurd! If you have absolutely nothing else to do, such as sleeping, then maybe consider watching this film. But honestly, it's not worth your time.",
    "Here's a more relatable adjustment of the content:\n\n\"I remember being a kid when this new TMNT series came out, and boy was it a letdown. Despite being a fan of the original cartoon, this version just didn't cut it for me. There's this one scene that sticks out in my memory where the mafia ape character tries to explain rhetorical questions to his underlings - it's just cringeworthy. While some fans criticized the show for introducing a female turtle, that part didn't really bother me. In fact, I totally forgot she existed until I recently stumbled upon some info about the series. Overall, it's a forgettable mess.\n\nThe one saving grace? The catchy theme song. It's a guilty pleasure for sure...Nananana ninja...\"",
    "This critique expresses disappointment and dissatisfaction with the crossover episode that featured the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and the Power Rangers. The absence of the female turtle, Venus, is appreciated due to its departure from the established canon. The critic believes that the episode missed the mark by portraying the turtles inaccurately, with wrong voices and out-of-character behavior. The design, animatronics, and overall execution are criticized for being subpar. The slow and unnatural lip syncing, the disrespect towards Shredder, and the corniness of the dragonlord character are highlighted as major flaws. The critic suggests that the episode could have been improved by having the characters behave more authentically, by eliminating Venus from the plot, and by enhancing the overall quality of the writing and animation.",
    "Since 1987, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles have been known as four brothers - Leonardo, Michelangelo, Raphael, and Donatello - with their teacher Splinter and their ever-changing enemies. The introduction of a female turtle, Venus, in the new series does not contribute meaningfully to the story nor add excitement. The original TMNT series from 1987, with its familiar characters and new adversaries in each episode, was much better in comparison. Introducing a female turtle weakens the action and does not align with the engaging storytelling we enjoy. We hope for more new adventures in the TMNT series, but prefer to stick with the original characters from 1987 without the addition of a female turtle.",
    "Do not waste your time on this film. The acting is subpar and the plot is unoriginal. It's best to skip this one unless you want a lesson in how not to make a good movie. Opt for a jog instead to avoid the disappointment.",
    "Horrendous film - that summarizes it all. Avoid at all costs. The acting is atrocious, the writing is pitiful. The only positive aspect - Deniz Akkaya's performance - was marred by a senseless and unpleasant rape scene. This movie is a complete disaster - poorly crafted and utterly implausible. The IMDb rule of requiring a minimum of 10 lines to express disdain for this abomination is absurd and unnecessary.",
    "If this movie doesn't make it to theaters, I recommend avoiding it altogether. Unless you're tired of watching well-made films, that is. I attended a screening at AFI Dallas last night but left with 20 minutes remaining because I had lost interest in the plot. It's worth noting a glaring mistake only 5 minutes into the film—a shattered window before any shots were fired, then breaking with the first shot—signaling a rough experience ahead. I won't go into all the shortcomings, but this movie falls short in every aspect, including the lackluster performance by Michael Madsen, which is underwhelming even by his standards. The handling of the rape scene is particularly uncomfortable. Giving it a rating of 3/10.",
    "Some movies are so horrendous that they crush your morale and make you question the state of our society. The overreliance on clichés is mind-boggling. Hollywood's obsession with guns as the main focus of every film is tedious and unrealistic. This film lacks creativity and drains the life out of you. It's a struggle to revive a tired formula, but this film fails miserably. It will leave you feeling worse about the world. In my opinion, this may just be the worst film ever made. Those responsible for this soul-sucking disaster should be ashamed.",
    "Congratulations to the genius who approved this one! Edward Furlong, buddy, let's chat. It's awesome that you're passionate about low-cost amateur projects, but it's tough to hit the mark every time. Let's aim for quality over quantity, yeah? <br/><br/>\nThe filming could use some work, like, a lot of work. Even an amateur with a camera could probably do better. <br/><br/>\nWhen it comes to acting, we might want to broaden our search beyond the supermarket. Great actors often come with experience or training! Now, onto the director, Mr. Jon Keeyes. Let's work together to find your strengths. Directing may not be your calling, but we can figure it out. Your angles might need a bit of tweaking, and the dialogue could use some finesse. And the music cues? Let's fine-tune those. Making movies is an art form that requires skill, and I believe in your potential to grow.<br/><br/>\nRather than a shootout flick, let's explore other creative avenues together. Maybe a fresh start is what we need. Consider trying something new or maybe taking a breather. Your hard work is appreciated, and I think you have more to offer!<br/><br/>\nRating: 1/10 (we all start somewhere!)",
    "I rented a DVD of this movie without any prior knowledge. Seeing Michael Madsen in a film I had never heard of made me suspicious, but since it was a freebie, I decided to give it a shot.\n\nIn hindsight, it seems like Mr. Blonde would likely want to erase any memory of being associated with such a poorly made film. The script and dialogs are terrible, and even the presence of good actors couldn't salvage the movie. The amateur actors featured in the film, particularly non-native English speakers attempting to portray native English speakers, only added to the lackluster experience. The dialogue feels unnatural and cringe-worthy, making it hard to believe anything happening in the movie. The music doesn't fit and overall, the production gives off a vibe reminiscent of a subpar school play.\n\nI suggest watching it just to gain an appreciation for better quality movies. This is why despite deserving a rating of 1, I gave it a 3.",
    "I stumbled upon this DVD at my friend's place, assuming it was a Turkish action flick featuring lesser-known Hollywood stars. Intrigued, I decided to give it a chance later on. However, watching it turned out to be quite a grueling ordeal. Initially, I scoffed at the thought of Turks attempting a Hollywood-style heist/hostage film, only to realize that the film was actually shot in America with an American director and crew. This revelation left me pondering how they managed to secure actors like Micheal Madsen, Edward Furlong, and Arnold Vosloo for this project — money, most likely. Delving deeper into my contemplation, I unraveled the secret behind securing a supposedly international cast: by cutting costs and hiring the most affordable equipment and crew available. The idea that the filmmakers may have also written and directed the movie themselves to stretch their budget further crossed my mind.\n\nContrary to popular belief, the movie wasn't as terrible as everyone claims. It prompts you to contemplate and reflect — a rare trait among contemporary films. It sparks curiosity, evokes disbelief, and encourages you to delve deeper into its narrative.",
    "What was the deal with all the Turkish actors? No offense, but it seemed like a wasted effort for them. The film lacked a solid script to challenge the actors' skills or showcase their talent. It provided very little substance; I specifically got the film to watch Michael Madsen, one of my favorite actors, but unfortunately, it turned out to be another disappointment for him. The script was atrocious, offering no depth or complexity for the characters. Madsen attempted to portray a tough character, but the weak script and direction limited his ability to bring depth and interest to the role.\n\nThe gunfight sound effects at the beginning of the film were unconvincing, resembling the noise of paintball guns in a skirmish rather than actual firearms. It was strange and lacked realism; even a video game would have better sound effects. Moreover, there was an irritating character in the robbery gang at the start of the film, whose high-pitched American accent made him sound like a girl while delivering lines such as \"Let's get the heck out of here\" and \"What are we gonna do, man?\" It was oddly amusing and elicited a brief chuckle. Overall, this film was silly and disappointing, especially for Madsen. Hopefully, he will recover from this setback.",
    "This movie didn't meet my expectations. Initially, I found the plot summary to be promising and decided to watch it. However, the acting was subpar, with the actors appearing uncomfortable in front of the camera, resulting in a lack of authenticity. I feel sorry for Edward Furlong, as I have fond memories of his performance in Terminator 2, a favorite of mine from years past that I've watched countless times.\n\nFurthermore, the plot itself was poorly constructed, with seemingly uninspired dialogue that may have been a result of the writers' lack of sleep.\n\nOn a positive note, despite its flaws, the movie falls into the category of being so bad that it becomes somewhat entertaining. It becomes the type of film you continue watching just to witness how much worse it can get, allowing you to later regale others with tales of its sheer terribleness.\n\nI believe everyone should watch this movie as a means to appreciate truly exceptional films even more.",
    "I am a huge admirer of Arnold Vosloo. It was a delight to finally see him take on a leading role in a recent movie, rather than just a minor part.<br /><br />However, having studied film appreciation in college, the one aspect that stood out to me negatively was the film's location in a deserted area without any background activity or bystanders.<br /><br />While the acting could have been better, Arnold's exceptional performance shines through. I attribute any shortcomings to poor direction and a supporting cast that falls short.<br /><br />I admire Arnold Vosloo greatly, and his presence in the film made it worth watching. Without him, I may have dismissed it as another disappointing movie.<br /><br />The rape scene was harsh and seemed unnecessary, although the actors who made it through to the end delivered solid performances. However, the sound effects during the shoot-out were subpar. Despite some continuity errors, these are forgivable given the film's overall quality.<br /><br />Overall, I found the film enjoyable, mainly due to Arnold Vosloo's involvement.<br /><br />Best regards, Jackie",
    "This is an artistic film produced either in 1969 or 1972, as noted by conflicting sources (the National Film Preservation Foundation cites 1969, whereas IMDb suggests 1972). Despite the ambiguity surrounding its exact year of creation, the film distinctly captures the essence of the late 1960s to early 1970s period. Its cinematography and pop art aesthetics embody the stylistic sensibilities of this era.\n\nComprising of three minimalist yet visually distorted images achieved through unconventional camera techniques, the film is enhanced by a musical accompaniment. Devoid of any dialogue or discernible narrative structure, it appears to be a deliberate exploration of performance art. The initial intrigue dissipates swiftly, leaving behind a monotonous experience. In essence, the film may only resonate with its creators, their acquaintances, and individuals considered avant-garde and ahead of their time, eluding conventional understanding.",
    "Nine minutes of trippy, swirling abstract images, sometimes even mirroring each other, can seriously mess with your head. I noticed a creepy eye right at the beginning, followed by some birds blending into different colors. Personally, it wasn't really my thing. Honestly, it felt like it went on for about 8 and a half minutes too long.",
    "This film boasts a plethora of stunning individuals that may captivate your attention. However, beneath the glamorous facade lies a lackluster script and an unengaging storyline. Despite some commendable performances, the overuse of distracting camera effects detracts from the viewing experience. While the cast shows promise, \"Loaded\" ultimately falls short of being a worthwhile watch. It's best to pass on this one, as it fails to deliver on its potential.",
    "This movie is the worst ever made. It goes beyond being bad and is an embarrassment to the art of filmmaking. It is so horrific that it questions humanity and our existence. The excessive use of cheesy editing effects and lack of originality make it unbearable to watch. Despite enjoying \"bad\" movies, this one crosses the line into a new dimension of awful. The most disturbing aspect is the apparent significant amount of money put into its production. It is suggested that the director should consume Drain-O due to the travesty created. This movie is so agonizing that it could be used as a form of torture. Overall, films like this should not be created and should be stopped immediately.",
    "There are moments when finishing a movie leaves one wishing for a refund on the time invested. This experience was undoubtedly one of those times. I came close to giving up, with just 15 minutes left to endure... and I regret not doing so.<br /><br />The rapid transition of a man from a respectable, controlled life to one of utter weakness and recklessness is hard to comprehend.<br /><br />Starting from a graduation party to the expected conclusion, Tristan Price (portrayed by Jesse Metcalfe), a man of privilege and sophistication, allows himself to be swayed by a woman, violence, and intoxicating substances. While the attraction to the captivating April (played by Nathalie Kelley) is understandable, his quick descent into drugs, violence, and unwavering commitment to a stranger is baffling.<br /><br />To be honest, apart from having the opportunity to admire Nathalie Kelley and Monica Keena, this movie lacks any redeeming qualities. Save your money, save your time... do anything else.",
    "The movie features a weak plot, predictable violence, and characters that are only somewhat interesting. It feels like the writer - who is also one of the stars - was embellishing their own mistakes and inserting wild drug and murder fantasies to make it more exciting. The film's rap and house soundtrack, along with the family conflicts, are poorly acted, stereotypical, and ultimately very dull. Additionally, the title is unoriginal, with IMDb showing five other movies released in 2007-2008 with the same name. I stumbled upon it on Showtime, which mistakenly listed the synopsis for a different film. It wasn't until halfway through that I realized none of the characters were undercover cops, which could have added an intriguing twist despite being a stereotype.",
    "While some have praised this film for its realistic depiction of drug effects and their impact on individuals, the overall execution falls short.

Despite having some visually appealing actors, the lackluster action sequences do not offer much excitement. \n\nIn contrast to the allure of \"bad\" movies, this film falls flat and offers little substance. For viewers seeking educational films on drug issues, there are far more effective options available such as 'Requiem For A Dream', 'Trainspotting', 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas', and 'Candy'.\n\nAdditionally, the movie lacks originality and even borrows memorable lines from other movies. Ultimately, it is advised to steer clear of this film to save both your money and time.",
    "According to IMDb, Corey Large is set to appear in a movie called \"Reload\" as a character named Sebastian Cole. The film is in production as of June 2008. The speaker questions how a poor-quality movie like this could deserve a sequel, especially considering that Sebastian supposedly died in a previous movie, \"Loaded.\" They watched \"Loaded\" during early morning insomnia episodes, and though they found it lacking overall, they thought Corey Large's acting was a highlight. They were somewhat surprised by the praise for the female actors, particularly the one playing Brooke, whom they found pretty but not outstanding.",

While these cuts were seemingly meant to convey deeper meaning, they fell flat and only served to irk the audience.<br /><br />Hoping for a satisfying conclusion to the turmoil depicted in the film, I was met with disappointment. Instead of closure, I felt as though my time had been squandered and the filmmakers had squandered their resources.",
    "This film is a poorly executed thriller that borrows elements from various other movies but fails to deliver any coherent storyline or engaging characters.

    "This is a movie that falls short in terms of entertainment quality. Although there are many worse movies out there. \n\nIn the gangster/drug scene genre, it's challenging to create a believable storyline, and this movie fails in that aspect. For instance, Sebastian's motives seem far-fetched and cliché. Additionally, the character relationships in the movie are not convincing.\n\nThe plot follows Tristan, who distances himself from his family, but the reasons for this are unclear. The film briefly touches on interesting themes such as the lack of rebellious behavior in upper-class families but fails to explore them in depth.\n\nWhile the movie raises some thought-provoking questions suitable for a socially critical drama, it falls short by focusing more on \"cool\" production techniques and special effects rather than character development and storyline evolution.\n\nIt attempts to convey an anti-substance abuse and violence message but ends up resembling a cheap action movie with average actors.

    "From the very start of the movie, you can sense the director's unique vision at play. Rather than allowing the story to dictate the style of the film, the director has boldly chosen to shape the narrative around a distinct cinematic approach. However, the execution falls quite short of expectations. It appears that the director aimed to create a stylish film but missed the mark by a wide margin. Despite its shortcomings, I must acknowledge that he does have a good command of the medium. I've certainly seen worse films than this one. To the film's credit, the director manages to maintain a sense of continuity throughout, and the actors deliver commendable performances.",
    "I briefly perused the movie, scrutinizing it just enough to grasp the essence of its plot. Frankly speaking, I found it rather uninteresting, with certain sequences leaving me perplexed. My sole motivation for watching this film was the captivating presence of CHACE CRAWFORD whom I find undeniably attractive, although I must admit his hairstyle in the movie was peculiar, yet still appealing.<br /><br />\nNevertheless, as appealing as CHACE's allure may be, it fell short in compensating for the film's shortcomings. While the storyline may have merit, what truly detracted from my viewing experience was the incessant profanity littered throughout - a rather unnecessary and off-putting component. Moreover, the ostentatious visual effects and erratic camera movements proved to be a source of discomfort.<br /><br />\nIn conclusion, despite the somewhat tolerable narrative, the film left me rather disenchanted, foundering in overwrought melodrama. Hence, I selectively confined my attention to scenes featuring CHACE. Humorously enough, this movie scarcely merits consideration, unless one harbors an unwavering allegiance to a particular cast member, much like my own fervor for CHACE. Indeed, the cast exuded undeniable allure, with the female contingent radiating a particularly captivating charm. Yet, without doubt, CHACE reigns supreme.",

    "I absolutely would have loved this film if I hadn't already read Pat Barker's 'Union Street.' But, that's not the case! Let me tell you - this film is right up my alley, incredibly well-crafted, and trust me, I'm not here to say otherwise. However, as an adaptation, it falls short in every possible way!\n\nThe gut-wrenching novel depicting the harsh reality of life in a working-class area in northern England gripped my heart and didn't let go for weeks! I was taken on a rollercoaster of emotions - tears, repulsion, shock, anger, sympathy, and pure misery, all thanks to the women of Union Street. Wow! This novel had moments where I almost had to look away, but I just couldn't stop reading. Yes, it's bleak, but my goodness, it's enthralling!\n\nNow, about the film - oh my goodness! Hollywood took Barker's raw truth and then sprinkled it with sweet icing sugar. Don't get me wrong, it's a beautiful film with an inspiring soundtrack, stellar performances, a story of hope and romance... absolutely! But is it a true adaptation of 'Union Street'? Definitely not!\n\nThe complex stories of the women from Union Street are distilled into Fonda's character in the movie - sure, they touch upon some tales, but many are just brushed aside. I get it, some themes from Barker's work are too sensitive for a wide audience, and portraying a narrative with seven main characters is a challenge. But here's my gripe - the soul and the gritty essence of the novel are missing! The darkness, rain, broken windows, and the vivid description of poverty are replaced with sunshine, pristine houses, and a cheerful score.\n\nIf you enjoyed the film for its positive outlook and hopeful tone in the face of harsh reality, then let me suggest this - brace yourself before diving into the book. You're in for something more akin to 'Schindler's List'...minus the happy ending!",
    "I caught a glimpse of the capsule comment raving about \"great acting.\" But let me tell you, these two actors delivered cringeworthy performances with zero chemistry, even under the direction of a usually great filmmaker who is way off his game here. Robert De Niro must be the master of being both brilliant and clueless at the same time. Jane Fonda's portrayal is all over the place, showing that she's lost in a poorly written character. The film's pacing is more agonizing than molasses, making it a real downer to sit through. Despite its aim to be an inspiring tale of overcoming illiteracy, the reality is a massive letdown. I'd rate it a measly 1 out of 10, easily one of the worst films I've seen at this budget level.",
    "Robert DeNiro plays an incredibly intelligent illiterate in this movie. The film wastes talented actors and is disappointing. The script and dialogue are unbelievable. Jane Fonda's character is a caricature and not amusing. The movie is slow-paced, poorly shot, and too preachy, filled with cliches. Swoozie Kurtz gives a good performance, but it doesn't redeem the film. Additionally, new IMDB rules needing ten lines for reviews are annoying. When a movie is this bad, a longer review isn't necessary. Avoid watching this film as it's a waste of time.",
    "A man has unnatural feelings for a pig in this absurd comedy with a chaotic opening scene. Unfortunately, the film remains off-putting throughout with unclear storytelling and confusing dialogue. While it boasts good cinematography by Vilmos Zsigmond and the briefly seen Sally Kirkland and Frederic Forrest, it may not appeal to all viewers.",
    "Dear Bait, I express my disdain towards you through the following points: \n\n1. Your attempts at humor fall flat, as your jokes are clichéd and lack originality, failing to evoke any genuine laughter but rather inducing a sense of nausea. \n\n2. Your dramatic elements come across as contrived and unconvincing, with exaggerated performances and unimpressive villains, reminiscent more of a failed attempt at intimidation by Bill Gates rather than a genuine threat. The portrayal of emotional scenes by Jamie Foxx is so exaggerated that it borders on the ridiculous, invoking further disbelief and discomfort. \n\n3. Your action sequences are lackluster and drawn-out, with shaky camerawork exacerbating the viewer’s discomfort to an extent reminiscent of The Blair Witch Project. The erratic filming style leads to a nauseating experience, further fueling the desire to disengage.\n\n4. Though striving to be a commendable production, your film falls short, resulting in an utter disappointment. The prospect of enduring your mediocrity is so exasperating that I would prefer enduring the harsh conditions of traversing the Sahara with minimal resources and Meryl Streep as my sole companion. Such a predicament sounds more tolerable than subjecting oneself to the absurd narrative and overacted performances of Bait. The nonsensical plot developments, such as miraculous escapes from life-threatening situations, only intensify the frustration, prompting a desire for immediate relief from the cinematic agony. Hence, I implore that such cinematic travesties are best avoided in the future to shield oneself from such distressing experiences.",
    "The movie's premise has already been discussed, and if you're still here, there's no need for me to play the role of a movie critic. Personally, my view on the film is rather disappointing. While I admire Takashi Miike as a filmmaker, this particular work falls beneath his usual standard, much like DOA 2 and 3, and various others.\n\nSome may overlook the movie's flaws simply because it bears Takashi's name, subscribing to a blind loyalty akin to that of high schoolers. However, for discerning viewers like us, enduring an hour and a half of senseless yelling from a child can be quite grating (and yes, it does detract from the viewing experience), while the film's pacing borders on inducing catatonia, and the acting... well, let's just say it's questionable.\n\nDie-hard Takashi fans may still give it a watch out of curiosity. Yet, it lacks any semblance of originality (think The NeverEnding Story) or meaningful character development besides a surface-level exploration of the lead character in the face of adversity.\n\nAlthough noted as Miike's first co-writing credit, the film fails to showcase much of his distinctive personality. Instead, we get glimpses of his signature visual style through the lens of the director of photography.\n\nThe movie possessed the potential to be remarkable, given its relatively straightforward premise. Regrettably, it appears to have faltered in its execution.\n\nFor those new to Miike's works, I recommend starting with classics like Gozu, Ichi the Killer, and Audition before delving into his deeper catalog, including Blue's Harp, Fudoh, Rainy Dog, and Bird People of China.",
    "The movie doesn't do justice to its talented cast. The dialogue feels forced, the ghosts lack magic, and some of the performances seem half-hearted. George C. Scott's portrayal of Scrooge lacks conviction, while Edward Woodward's stilt-walking Ghost of Christmas Present is reminiscent of Bernard Cribbins. Only Frank Finlay stands out with his overacting.",
    "I was thrilled beyond measure to watch this movie after immersing myself in the book just a week before. Anticipation was at its peak as my 13-year-old son and I settled in, ready to experience a beloved holiday tale brought to vivid life on the screen.\n\nHowever, my excitement soon turned to disappointment. The movie strayed far too frequently from the beloved book, leaving me disheartened. While George C. Scott’s talent shone through, his portrayal felt lackluster for the most part, with moments of true immersion few and far between.\n\nAlthough I understand the limitations of filmmaking in '84, particularly in the absence of today's advanced CG effects, the overall quality left much to be desired, especially during the encounter with Jacob Marley.\n\nThe most crushing blow came from the omission of a pivotal moment in the story: the captivating journey where the Spirit of Christmas Present reveals the enduring light and love of the holiday season in the face of despair around the world.\n\nDespite my reservations, I must commend Mr. Scott for his portrayal of the transformed Scrooge at the end, a truly refreshing perspective. Yet, I couldn't help but wish for a grittier representation of Bob Cratchit and a more convincing performance from the depiction of Tiny Tim.\n\nOverall, while this adaptation had its moments, it left me yearning for a more faithful retelling that captured the true essence and emotion of this timeless classic.",
    "Having previously viewed three other adaptations of the same film, I find this one to be the weakest due to Scott's lackluster and unengaging performance. His portrayal lacks depth, making it hard to connect with the story. Alistair Sim's depiction of the role was far superior. Scott fails to convincingly deliver the dialogue during Scrooge's pivotal moments, resulting in a lack of emotional impact. Comparatively, the actors in the Alistair Sim version outshine those in this adaptation. Even musical renditions and interpretations by the Muppets are more skillfully executed. Overall, this version is disappointing.",
    "I viewed a film in my English class this afternoon and was rather dismayed by the quality of this particular adaptation. While George C. Scott delivered a commendable performance as Scrooge, the remaining cast members fell short of expectations. The inconsistent acting and the recurrent proclamation of \"Merry Christmas to everyone!\" had me alternating between amusement and near slumber.<br /><br />This film is an interpretation of a short story by Charles Dickens, depicting a wealthy individual who initially dismisses the holiday season as mere nonsense. Following encounters with three enlightening spirits, the protagonist experiences a transformation in his perspective on Christmas.<br /><br />I am perplexed as to how a production with such a hastily constructed screenplay garnered positive reviews. Instead of endorsing this lackluster film, I wholeheartedly recommend the comedic rendition of the tale, \"Scrooged,\" featuring Bill Murray. It, at the very least, managed to elicit laughter.",
    "When will this pain end? I never want to watch another remake of A Christmas Carol. They just keep churning out movies with the same story, all competing to be the best, but they always fall short. It's such a tired old tale, full of morals and outdated, happy-go-lucky thinking. Like anyone actually learns anything from it! The fact that they keep making different versions shows that we never really do.",
    "It was 9:30 PM last night at my friend's camping trailer and we were excited to catch a new episode of South Park. That being said, South Park airs at 10:30 PM in my country, so to pass the time, we tuned into another show, Father of the Pride. I must confess, I've only seen a couple of episodes of Father of the Pride. Initially, I found it lacking in humor and unnecessarily crude, prompting me to consider the importance of getting enough rest for an early morning football game. Nevertheless, I decided to give Father of the Pride another chance recently and noticed striking similarities to The Simpsons, except with lions in place of the iconic yellow human characters.<br /><br />Curiously, I question the show's TV-14 rating as I find The Simpsons to be more overtly vulgar, with Father of the Pride only featuring a few unimpressive homosexual jokes. The Simpsons also delves into darker themes and crude content, especially in their Halloween specials. Despite learning that the creator of Father of the Pride also directed Shrek 2, I believe the film outshines the show, perhaps due to the creator's focus on family-friendly content. Admittedly, Father of the Pride did manage to bring a smile to my face, even leading to a moment of genuine laughter on a few occasions.<br /><br />All things considered, I view Father of the Pride with indifference. It doesn't incite hatred, yet it fails to capture my interest as compellingly as The Simpsons has in the past.<br /><br />Rating: 3.5/10",
    "This is an exciting futuristic twist on Jules Verne's \"Mysterious Island\"! The sound editing may not be up to par, but it adds to the charm – hearing the on-set dialogue and recorded voices simultaneously gives it a raw, authentic feel. Shot with a group of lively Boston actors in scenic New Hampshire, this amateur film has a captivating energy that will leave New England viewers spellbound! With the director's voice guiding the actors and unique characters like a mind-talking guy and a deep-voiced blue alien, there's never a dull moment. Despite its flaws, the imaginative special effects and dynamic music create an unforgettable experience. Even with its jerky animation reminiscent of Karl Zeman's style, this film showcases Brett Piper's early talent and creativity. In the end, \"Mysterious Planet\" puts other classics like EQUINOX or PLANET OF THE DINOSAURS to shame, making it a must-see for budding filmmakers! And can you believe it was made on a shoestring budget? A true inspiration for anyone passionate about cinema!",
    "\"Let me share with you a hidden gem - Mysterious Planet, a hilariously bad movie that somehow manages to find a special place in my heart. From its comically poor special effects to the laughably awful soundtrack in the first 15 minutes, it's a ride you won't soon forget.<br /><br />Picture this: a space scene so nonsensical that you'll be questioning your sanity, with washing-up liquid bottles flying by as dialogue gets lost in a sea of confusion. And let's not forget the unforgettable double-headed plasticine giant snail that our heroes must face, complete with a delightful mix of original and dubbed voices.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this cinematic masterpiece is a rare find. I like to think I hold the only copy in existence, making it a true treasure for those who appreciate the so-bad-it's-good genre. Take my word for it, you won't want to miss this one-of-a-kind experience!\"",

    "In this TV movie, William Russ is the protagonist who reappears to settle his debts and faces persuasion from the versatile Peter Falk (Colombo) to return home. Despite engaging performances from the former star Peter Falk, the plot is mediocre with predictable storytelling. The movie falls short with an underwhelming performance from William Russ, resulting in a lackluster viewing experience that earns it a \"D\" grade.",
    "\"Finding John Christmas\" is a poorly executed film with a confusing plot, bad dialogue, and lackluster acting from Valerie Bertinelli and co-stars. The script by Michael J. Murray is juvenile. Instead of watching this disappointing movie, consider enjoying classic Christmas films like \"Miracle on 34th Street,\" \"It's a Wonderful Life,\" or modern favorites like \"Home Alone.\" Your time would be better spent seeking out these films for a more enjoyable holiday viewing experience. Merry Christmas!",
    "I never really like to talk about good movies, but when it comes to a bad one, I have to be straight up about it. Let's chat about Vivah - this guy, Sooraj Badjatya, seems to have totally missed the mark after the success of Hum Aapke Hain Kaun. He thought he could strike gold with this cheesy wedding flick. Vivah is dripping with cheese to the point that the Badjatyas have out-cheesed the Johars and Chopras by a mile.<br /><br />Not one moment during the movie made me go 'Wow, this is good!'. Aloknath plays the typical dad role, Shahid Kapoor seems kinda bloated and overdone, Amrita Rao adds to the disaster with the unattractive sets, lousy costumes, tired plot, evil stepmother, actors trying too hard, irritating background music, and subpar soundtracks.<br /><br />And here comes the spoiler alert - like in all his other films, after a disaster, the movie still wraps up with a happy ending. So, be prepared for that!",
    "I wouldn't necessarily call this movie terrible, but it definitely didn't impress me. I was hoping for something better, especially after watching \"Hum Aapke Hain Kaun.\" This film felt completely outdated. I kept waiting for some surprising twists, but all I got was the girl getting burned and earning her aunt's affection.\n\nDespite being engaged, the characters needed approval for every little thing, and they were painfully shy despite numerous interactions. I thought the aunt would be more wicked, but she just complained incessantly.\n\nSure, we all have our moments with the kids, but we don't constantly shed tears. This movie painted an idealistic picture of a happy family, with one villainous woman, supportive in-laws, and a man deeply in love with his wife. It was interesting how the roles reversed for Anupam Kher from \"HAHK,\" now playing the poor bride's father. I had a feeling Mohnish Behl would make an appearance as well. All in all, I feel like I wasted my time watching this. I'd rate it a 2 out of 10.",
    "An adult version of Cinderella immersed in a dreamy, unrealistically romantic tale, with Shahid Kapoor shining as the star. If you seek dreamlike love stories, this is your pick, but for realistic folks, it might not be worth your three hours. Wake up and skip this film! Four out of five viewers with me didn't enjoy it, mainly due to its overly unrealistic scenes. Can it really surpass a classic like Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam?",
    "After being absolutely dazzled by Mr. Brosnan's charismatic turn as a scoundrel in \"The Tailor of Panama\" (a perfect 10/10 in every category: casting, acting, script, story, editing, pace, music, emotional depth, and more), I eagerly awaited his newest film. However, my excitement quickly transformed to disappointment. This movie felt more like a dry script reading than a full-blown cinematic experience, choosing vulgarity over substance at every turn. It pales in comparison to the richness and satisfaction found in \"The Tailor of Panama.\" The blame lies squarely on the shoulders of the screenwriter and director. Despite sitting in anticipation for that anticipated standout moment, it never materialized. No laughter, no tears, just one fleeting smile from a snippet of dialogue. Was it worth the $7 ticket price? Not in the slightest.",
    "I was on the verge of leaving, but I had already paid for the movie ticket, and my equally disappointed friend insisted on staying. After the charming innocence of \"A New Hope\" and the captivating sophistication of \"The Empire Strikes Back,\" I eagerly anticipated the release of \"Return of the Jedi.\" However, right from the first scene of this excessively commercialized film, I felt a deep sense of disappointment and fury towards Lucas. The sheer commercialism of the movie was profoundly disheartening, and it was evident that Lucas lacked even a trace of shame in his quest for profit. The introduction of Episode I only reinforced this viewpoint - I rest my case, Your Honor, on the egregiousness of Jarjar Binks (though I must request that the jury members be provided with barf bags beforehand).\n\nFrom the moment the gate opened at Jabba's lair, it became clear that the \"film\" was primarily a lengthy advertisement for a plethora of marketable action figures that Lucas shamelessly injected throughout the movie - from the grotesque guards and peculiar flunky to Jabba's repulsive muppet-pet and the extensive array of characters, both new and recycled, including the detestably adorable Ewoks and the rebel alliance aliens, each given mere seconds of screen time to entice young viewers. The blatant exploitation of children's consumerist tendencies was nauseatingly evident.\n\nFurthermore, Lucas failed to offer a fresh storyline, instead regurgitating the Death Star from \"A New Hope\" and inundating the movie with saccharine sentimentality. This move felt like a blatant betrayal of the loyal fan base, as though Lucas took pleasure in subjecting them to such substandard material, manipulating their loyalty for his financial gain. The underlying message seemed to be, \"I can produce the most repulsive garbage imaginable, and my fans will still line up in droves to watch it, buying every trinket associated with the film, thereby enriching me further.\"\n\nAlthough there may have been a few fleeting moments where Harrison Ford's performance shone through the mire, any redeeming aspects were overshadowed by the overwhelming sense of overt commercialism that Lucas crassly prioritized in this ultimate capitulation to profit over artistic integrity.",
    "This story follows the unfortunate fate of a secretary caught in a love affair with a married man, leading to a tragic ending. However, the narrative leaves us with more questions than answers, as only one side of the story is presented. The portrayal of the characters may resonate with those familiar with the complexities of romance and betrayal. The tension between moral dilemmas and personal desires adds depth to the tale. Joining the characters on their journey will definitely make you ponder the complexities of relationships, loyalty, and consequences. So grab your popcorn, get cozy, and prepare to be taken on a rollercoaster of emotions!",
    "This film will keep you on the edge of your seat with its unexpected twists and turns! A wild ride from start to finish, filled with shocking betrayals and surprising revelations. Don't miss out on this rollercoaster of emotions and drama!",
    "This film is a blatant attempt to capitalize on the popularity of Sex in the City and Four Weddings and a Funeral. Renaming it \"Sex at a Funeral\" might have given it a better chance at the box office.<br /><br />However, the film struggles to find its identity. The characters deliver ridiculously clever lines but lack any semblance of humanity. A series of nonsensical actions drive the barely-there plot, leaving viewers disillusioned with the entire endeavor.<br /><br />And while Andie MacDowell gives a commendable performance, the standout is Imelda Staunton, who plays an unexpected role as a police detective (no height requirements, apparently). Staunton's flawless portrayal contrasts with the shortcomings of the writer-director.<br /><br />If you found Notting Hill insincere, steer clear of this one. It's a phony baloney experience you'll want to avoid.",
    "This film is criticized for being one of the worst ever. Kate's introduction scene with Jed and a group of guys clapping is described as overly Hollywood. Another negative aspect mentioned is when Kate was shown running her hands over the pavement, giving the impression that she was examining its texture. The acting of Andie was heavily criticized, making it difficult for viewers to connect with the characters and feel their love for each other. The other two women in the film were praised for their performances, overshadowing Andie. Overall, the movie is regarded as overly campy, with many unrealistic situations. Andie's acting was deemed unhelpful to the film. Additionally, a comment was made about Andie's appearance stating that she appears to show a lot of gums and suggesting that her glamorous look in commercials might be achieved with heavy makeup.",
    "The text portrays a negative beginning, with three women acting immaturely while sharing gin, cigarettes, and a caramel chocolate treat for the best 'man' story. It worsens as Andie's character, a headmistress of an English school, falls for her former 14-year-old student who is now an organ player but faces destruction due to her vengeful 'girlfriend'. The storyline descends into clichéd melodrama as Andie's character forgives her 'friend', has the organ player's child, and the three women continue their gin-drinking and cigarette-smoking routine. The narrative concludes with Andie's character discarding the caramel chocolates on the street in a feeble attempt to suggest personal growth.",
    "Delve into the captivating drama of conflicting friendships and humorous mishaps in a film that teeters between hilarity and heartache.

Unravel the tangled web of emotions as the characters navigate through comedy and introspection, raising questions about the essence of true friendship. Prepare for surprises, ranging from comedic graveyard escapades to bittersweet confrontations, all wrapped in a cinematic experience that will keep you guessing until the very end.",
    "This film on IFC is alarming! Amazed by the positive reviews, I can't be the only one who found the characters far from genuine. Kate is expected to be a respectable community figure but is willing to risk her job for a relationship with Jed. Their sudden \"love\" and her extreme grief over his death, yet she skips his funeral and withholds crucial information from his family. How did an American become headmistress of a traditional British school? Janine's abuse of power should have resulted in severe consequences, not a romantic entanglement with a suspect! And Molly's actions are best left unspoken. Janine and Molly's misplaced guilt over Jed is misplaced, considering the circumstances of his demise. What about Gerald, the innocent bystander who suffers as a result? If only I could express my disapproval to the makers of this film.",
    "This movie is not set in New York, but in the British countryside. It may start as a comedy but quickly turns into a dramatic and \"abracadabrantesque\" tale, resembling a French presidential mandate. Despite the confusing plot, the standout performances of the actresses, especially McDowell, captivate with their delicate and nuanced portrayal of characters. The movie offers a feminine perspective, showcasing diverse ways of living and a multitude of viewpoints. While enjoyable, the abrupt ending may leave viewers craving more.",
    "Was this movie supposed to be a comedy or a serious drama? It starts with light banter between three women, then transitions into conflict when one meets a man. As the plot darkens, the tone changes, making it hard to connect with the original feel. The attempt to return to light banter at the end feels forced and the conclusion lacks believability. This British film failed at the box office and was not well-known, even years after its release.",
    "Andie McDowell captivates as the 40-something woman embarking on a late but passionate romance with a much younger man, causing rifts with her two closest friends.<br /><br />Perceiving the young man as a gigolo or gold-digger, the friends take extreme measures to end the relationship, blinded by their own opinions and fears.<br /><br />The series of outlandish events push the boundaries of believability, shattering any hopes of a genuine love story. Instead of a heartfelt tale, viewers are left bewildered and disappointed, shaking their heads at the incredulity of it all. Proceed with caution and lower your expectations before watching this film — it falls woefully short of a satisfying experience, meriting a meager rating of 4 out of 10. Don't waste your time on this one; there are far superior options available.",
    "SPOILER ALERT: In a surprising turn of events, the character Jed is mistakenly accused of infidelity and abruptly expelled by Kate, a spinster played by Andie McDowell. Thinking she has caught Jed in a compromising situation, Kate dramatically kicks him out, throwing his shoes after him. Jed, despite his reluctance, leaves and decides to sit in the middle of the road to put his shoes back on, only to tragically meet his end when he is struck by a truck, a significant moment symbolized by the film's title, \"Crushed.\"\n\nIt is hard to believe that a screenwriter would include such a dramatic plot twist in a supposedly light-hearted comedy. Until this point, the movie attempts to be whimsical but falls short, lacking the genuine charm to captivate the audience. Sadly, Jed is the only character with any redeeming qualities, as the rest of the cast comes across as annoying. However, there is a shift towards the end as the female characters find solace in friendship and support, leaving behind their destructive tendencies. This unexpected turn of events earns the film a disappointing rating of 2 out of 5.",
    "The main flaw of Crush is not its poor acting, lack of plot, or subpar camerawork. Rather, its few outstanding moments lead you to anticipate more. However, these moments are overshadowed by the film's shortcomings. If you enjoy violin music and melodramatic scenes featuring women over 40, you may appreciate it. Personally, I found these elements off-putting and had a negative experience. Overall rating: 4/10.",
    "Not a 'chick flick', but a film for everyone. This is one of the worst movies ever made by a male director about women. Director Andy McKay clearly lacks understanding of women. It is filled with bad taste, reminiscent of American Pie's humor, a crude and senseless storyline, unrealistic characters, and tasteless fantasies brought to life on screen. Insulting and far from funny. It's perplexing how three talented actresses agreed to be a part of this project.",
    "As a single woman over 40, I found this film to be demeaning and insulting towards women in general, regardless of age. It was a poor attempt at a \"chick flick\" by a male writer and director, which ultimately failed. The lack of plot and character development, along with the unrealistic scenarios, made it impossible to connect with any of the characters. Additionally, the forced male fantasy of a woman exploring lesbianism was disappointing. Overall, I regret wasting 112 minutes of my life on this film and wish I could get a refund on the DVD rental.",
    "I received this movie as a gift because of its promising storyline about the friendship between three women, which is disrupted when one of them falls in love with a younger man. However, I found the execution rather disappointing. The characters are portrayed in exaggerated ways, lacking mutual support and instead engaging in schemes to undermine one another.\n\nDespite admiring Anna Chancellor and Imelda Staunton in the past, I was let down by the poor script that forced them to navigate a blend of slapstick and screwball comedy, which felt out of place for professional women in a small town. The portrayal of these intelligent women constantly lamenting about their romantic lives seemed cliché and unoriginal.\n\nThe potential of the storyline, particularly the lesbian sub-plot, was not fully explored, and the depiction of the women as heavy smokers and drinkers felt unrealistic, especially during the baby scene. Overall, I believe this film could have been much better with a stronger script and more tension. Sadly, it fell short of expectations. I would rate it a 4 out of 10.",
    "\"The Crush\" is an absolutely delightful and charming romantic comedy that captures the essence of friendship and love! It cleverly weaves together the perfect blend of romance and comedy, reminiscent of the iconic \"Sex and the City.\" <br /><br />I was particularly captivated by the brilliant portrayal of the young hunk, played by the talented Kenny Doughty, whose character adds a refreshing twist to the storyline. And let's not forget the fantastic performance by Andie MacDowell, who shines as an ex-pat amidst a stellar cast of familiar faces from British dramas and comedies. <br /><br />While the plot takes some unexpected turns towards the end, it keeps you on the edge of your seat with its dramatic flair. And as the credits rolled, I couldn't help but appreciate the unique perspective of writer/director Scot John McKay. His fresh take on relationships and identity adds a layer of depth that sets \"The Crush\" apart from the rest. <br /><br />Overall, this film is a must-watch for anyone looking for a heartwarming and entertaining cinematic experience. Don't miss out on the magic of \"The Crush\"! 🎬💖",
    "The movie could potentially have been improved by delving deeper into a more thought-provoking theme rather than simply skimming the surface of a lesbian relationship. It follows a predictable trajectory, with the two lead actresses bearing a striking resemblance to the Russian music duo t.A.T.u, which may not be entirely coincidental. Lacking originality, the film seems to rely on the fame of others to bolster its appeal. The various supporting actors, many of whom are notable figures in Romania, do not seem to have well-defined roles, with some not even being professional actors. In essence, the formula seems to be \"inspired\" by t.A.T.u, coupled with fame-seeking actors and a lackluster plot, sprinkled with profanity for shock value—resulting in a disappointing end product. Despite the potentially good premise, the movie falls short, leaving much to be desired.",
    "The movie has a good storyline, but the main cast's acting falls short. Maria's performance feels dry and lacks emotion, while Ioana appears tense and unnatural. Tudor is the only standout with his acting. Despite some good elements, like the story and a few performances, the movie overall disappoints. The incestuous relationship in the film seems more believable than the underdeveloped lesbian relationship between Maria and Ioana.",
    "This movie heavily relies on the controversial themes of incest and lesbianism for attention, but unfortunately falls short in creating a compelling storyline. The dialogue is weak, the sensuality in the \"sex scenes\" is lacking, and the overall acting and dialogue feel more suitable for high-school audiences rather than adults. The excessive use of inner monologues further cheapens its quality. It ultimately comes across as a gutless and shallow film that misses the mark on delivering a gripping narrative and engaging drama. It could have greatly benefited from a stronger plot and more depth. Additionally, while the resources may be limited, that should not be an excuse for the film's lackluster performance. The use of musicians rather than trained actors, such as Tudor Chirila, also hinders the movie's credibility. Overall, it's a disappointing viewing experience for both Romanian cinema and mature audiences alike.",
    "The film \"Love Sick\" portrays the intense and complicated sexual relationships of Alex, Kiki, and Sandu resulting in a sad ending. Director Tudor Giurgiu aimed to depict the complexity of Romanian sexual life. The movie lacked a clear explanation of how the relationships developed and did not include a scene of Alex and Kiki's sexual intercourse. However, some scenes, such as the ear-piercing moment and their conversation on the soccer field, were touching and recommended.",
    "I am not as similar to Love Sick as I initially thought. The film delves into the complex sexual relationships among Alex, Kiki, and Sandu, embodying intense emotions of frustration and jealousy. Ultimately, Alex awakens to the realization that their love triangle has no future, culminating in a sorrowful ending.\n\nDirector Tudor Giurgiu joined us at the AMC theatre on Sunday at 12:00 PM on 08/10/06 to watch the movie together. Post-viewing, he shared his intention behind creating the film, aiming to portray the intricate nature of Romanian sexual relationships.\n\nIn my view, sexual relations are inherently intricate universally, and I did not find the movie particularly impactful. The romantic entanglements of Alex and Kiki, as well as Kiki and her brother Sandu, resembled a commonplace neighborhood tale.\n\nThere are two main reasons I did not enjoy this movie. Firstly, it failed to illustrate how the characters' love connections unfolded. It seemed abrupt, with the implication that Alex fell for Kiki simply by living in the same building. Secondly, the absence of a depiction of Alex and Kiki's intimate relationship left me wanting more. Despite this, there were still aspects worth recommending, such as the poignant \"ear piercing\" scene where Alex endures pain to show his love for Kiki. Additionally, the scene where they lie in the soccer field and converse authentically about their love was moving and heartfelt.",
    "This movie, despite its significant and well-executed launch, fell short of expectations. The opening scene, featuring two brothers in an intimate embrace, sets a questionable tone that continues on a downward spiral. The plot lacks any standout moments to capture attention, overshadowed by lackluster performances and a superficial exploration of promising themes like incest and lesbianism. While the filmmakers may claim subtlety, the end result feels disappointingly shallow. Viewers seeking highlights will be left wanting, ultimately disillusioned by the missed opportunities in a film that fails to deliver. Save yourself the time and skip this one, as there are much more fulfilling ways to spend an evening.",
    "It's possible that the movie had potential to be good, featuring a complex love story. However, it was poorly executed. The visuals are inconsistent and the overall presentation feels cluttered and restricted. The audio quality needs improvement, as is common in Romanian films, and the lighting and color choices are questionable at times. The soundtrack is lackluster and doesn't enhance the storyline. The acting is underwhelming, with only the landlady delivering a convincing performance. Overall, the acting lacks maturity and fails to engage the audience. The film comes across as naive, told from a childish perspective. It's recommended to only watch out of extreme curiosity.",
    "Closer to authenticity and delving deeper than \"Breakdance\", Stan Lathan's \"Beat Street\" exudes a subtle charm. Although seizing the wave of the 'breakin' craze, this film manages to offer some entertainment by delving into the lives of three young comrades and a spirited kid in Queens, New York. Each showcases a distinctive flair - one is a hustler, another a d.j., while the third is an artist known for crafting 'burners', and Lee, the youngest, shines as a dynamic 'hip-hop' dancer.\n\nLathan struggles to capture genuine interest in the narrative, with the young ensemble also grappling to embody their roles. Consequently, the film heavily relies on its infectious music and dynamic dancing to carry the weight.\n\nDespite the sharp choreography that electrifies both nightclub and street scenes, it fails to catapult \"Beat Street\" to greater eminence. Regrettably, the movie loses its momentum towards the end, just as a glimmer of promise emerges that it could blossom into something intriguing.\n\nSunday, August 25, 1996 - Video",
    "This movie is about a group of high school students who are into hip-hop, breakdancing, graffiti, and aspiring to become a DJ. However, the film is not well-received. Many find the acting terrible and the drama lacking. The characters are supposed to be charming, but they come across as dull. One character in particular, Ramon, who does graffiti on subway trains, is criticized for defacing public property. The movie portrays these law-breaking activities as enjoyable, which some viewers find questionable. While there are some noteworthy musical performances in the film, the constant hip-hop music can be overwhelming. The movie's focus on music leaves much to be desired in terms of storytelling. Despite a few entertaining scenes, the movie's emphasis on hip-hop may not appeal to everyone. Additionally, the film contains a surprising amount of profanity for a PG-rated movie.",
    "Wow! Wild Style and Style Wars are truly original Hip Hop masterpieces that capture the essence of the culture with authenticity and grittiness. While Beat Street features some early Hip Hop artists, it falls short in comparison to the raw energy and spirit found in the first two movies. The music and dancing in Beat Street may be enjoyable, but its overproduced Hollywood style misses the mark for true enthusiasts. Personally, I find the beats lacking and prefer the genuine vibe of Wild Style. Regardless of differing tastes, it's clear that this movie doesn't quite hit the mark for me, earning only a 4 out of ten rating. But hey, the dancing is still pretty awesome!",
    "I experienced a sense of disappointment while viewing \"Happy Days\" upon the introduction of the character Chachi, which led me to anticipate similar sentiments during a recent film viewing. Despite a notable cameo by Scott Baio in a thrilling skateboard chase scene, the overall impression was lackluster. Jodie Foster, in her inaugural mature role, delivered a commendable performance, yet failed to elevate the film from its uninteresting narrative. Regrettably, this cinematic venture consumed two hours of my time with no redeeming qualities. The lack of compelling characters, implausible plotline, subpar editing, and dismal cinematography further belied any semblance of engagement. Set in 1970s California, the film portrays disillusioned teenagers navigating inept parental figures, resulting in a depiction void of depth or intrigue. I advise against investing time in this lackluster production that fails to meet even the most basic standards of quality filmmaking.",
    "Awful film featuring scattered elements of the Ramones. Follows the typical 1970's/80's comedy format where the cool kids take charge of the school with a whimsical plan. The movie's plot revolves around a Ramones-loving girl and a school rebelling against their oppressive administration. Skip this film and opt for something like Wild Zero starring Guitar Wolf for an entertaining B movie experience. Poor acting, writing, and plot with the Ramones seemingly involved for a quick cash grab. This film is simply terrible.",
    "This movie feels like a 90-minute Ramones concert sprinkled with random silliness and moments that drag on forever. Seriously, what kind of high school is this supposed to be?<br /><br />Unless you're a die-hard Ramones fan, please, I beg you, don't waste your time like I did. It was painful to watch from beginning to end. They should rename it Ramone Fever because that's all you'll see. Everyone seems to love them in this film, but there's no real storyline to follow. As far as teen comedies go, this one is rock bottom.",
    "I rated this film 2 stars solely due to Dominic Monaghan's commendable acting performance. However, the overall quality of the film is notably subpar. The direction of the movie was executed poorly, indicating the need for the director to reconsider her career path and possibly gain inspiration from watching other films. Despite Monaghan's skill as an actor, his talents were not showcased effectively in this low-quality production. The portrayal of Jack's best friend by an unknown actor was unconvincing and should have been avoided altogether. I had low expectations for a small-scale film like this, but it would benefit from more depth and effort in developing the characters and their environment. I strongly advise against investing your time or money in this disappointing film.",
    "I eagerly anticipated watching this movie without any cuts or interruptions, given the positive reviews. However, just as it started to build suspense, it shied away and shifted focus. The eerie elements such as dripping water, black rain, prophetic dreams, and getting lost in raw sewage were introduced but not fully explored to create a chilling atmosphere.\n\nDisappointingly, Chamberlain's expressionless performance left me feeling bewildered as the film progressed. The potential of incorporating Aboriginal chants and instruments in the background was lost in a chaotic mix that did little to evoke fear. The themes of ancient gods inhabiting modern individuals and the belief that red-haired white men were the first priests were presented superficially rather than delving into their deeper meaning regarding the Dream Time.\n\nIn the climactic scene, the intended message was unclear. The significance of a massive wave causing devastation resembling an apocalypse seemed exaggerated given the lack of establishing the world's dire state. The final wave's impact on Burton felt disconnected and failed to resonate as a significant event.\n\nThe most chilling moment occurred in Charlie's apartment when Burton confronts an old man for scaring his wife, with the repeated question \"Who are you?\" creating a truly unsettling atmosphere. Unfortunately, this level of unease was not maintained throughout the film, missing the opportunity to fully showcase Weir's potential.",
    "In this episode, a woman murders her husband with a poker, but her plan is interrupted by a crazy man dressed as Santa Claus. She tries to hide the body and frames the Santa killer for the murder. The episode is repetitive and lacks originality, focusing on the woman's efforts to avoid getting caught with a dead body while staying safe from the maniac. It doesn't stand out as a memorable episode of Tales from the Crypt.",
    "The noise you're hearing isn't bees, it's the aftermath of enduring an incredibly lengthy, tediously dull movie that's poorly acted. I have no idea how I managed to stay awake for the full 3 1/2 hours. The storyline is quite straightforward - three highly unappealing characters conversing about sex over the course of 3 1/2 hours. You might have thought Rohmer's films were boring, but this one is on a whole other level. Watching this whole movie without switching it off or resorting to violence must mean I have a high tolerance for suffering.",
    "Iberia is absolutely delightful to watch on TV, but have you ever thought about experiencing it on the silver screen? This movie is a captivating blend of dance and music that will surely leave you in awe. Whether you have a soft spot for classical music or a love for modern dance, this could very well be your next favorite date night movie! And let's not forget about the mesmerizing skillful dancing that Bollywood movies are known for. If you appreciate skillful dancing incorporated into a lengthy movie, Bollywood is the way to go! Director Carlos Saura's expertise in capturing dance sequences shines throughout the film, making it a visually stunning experience. While the movie may be a bit lengthy at one and a half hours, the beauty and artistry displayed are well worth your time. Remember, not all art needs to be larger than life, and this film beautifully showcases the art of dance and music in its own unique way.",
    "I'm surprised that critics enjoyed this movie because, honestly, it's a mess. The plot is confusing, the characters are flat, and Michael Bowen's character is just a nosy, judgmental mess. There's nothing compelling or interesting about any of it. It's not edgy, imaginative, or clever. In fact, it's downright tedious. It's no wonder this movie didn't make it to theaters, and the fact that it's being aired on \"This Network\" is just sad. I suggest ditching this trainwreck and tuning into a rerun of the Garden Smart show on PBS for a much better time. If you stumble upon this disaster late at night, go for a walk instead. Even if it's in smog, you'll thank yourself for avoiding this mess. Life is short, but this movie sure isn't.",
    "This movie is absolutely awful - the script is terrible, the direction is bad, and the ending is nonsensical. The performances, with the exception of Clancy Brown and Michael Pollard, are also subpar. Watching this movie feels like purgatory - enduring it helps balance out the bad movie karma so you can enjoy a good one later on.<br /><br />The film revolves around a father and son who don't look like they could possibly be related. The male lead's character is poorly written and lacks charisma. The plot points are predictable, and the actions of the female lead and her brother, the cop, are illogical. Moreover, a significant action by the female lead at the end of the movie is inconsistent with the script.",
    "Burt Kennedy's prior brilliance as a director is nowhere to be seen in this sluggish production. The film appears not only low-budget, but also recycles battle scenes from the vastly superior \"The Last Command\" from 1955, making it seem outdated in comparison. The original action sequences lack direction and coherence, mirroring the overall substandard quality of the entire film. The project exudes the amateurish feel of a poorly-made student film, suggesting a limited budget. The pacing is as slow as molasses, with an inconsistent cast delivering performances that swing between exaggerated and lifeless. Despite a commendable effort by Raul Julia, the ensemble's overall display falls short. Historical inaccuracies further detract from the experience. In addition, the lengthy three-hour runtime exacerbates the tedium, contrasting with the concise approach more suitable for uninteresting content. For a worthwhile viewing experience on the topic of the Alamo, consider the 1960 adaptation by John Wayne or revisit the original 1955 film. It's baffling that six producers were involved in creating such a disappointing film. A definite pass.",
    "This film is acclaimed as a top-tier James Arness western but is notorious for being the worst Alamo movie ever created. The storyline was abysmal, filled with inaccuracies and blatant distortions. The lack of continuity was glaring, exemplified by the nonsensical cannon sequence where cannons with mud and ramrods protruding from them were fired by the Mexicans. The absurdity was further compounded by Brian Keith's preposterous hat choice, indicating a lapse in costuming judgment.",
    "This movie has a lot of problems. It focuses more on the myths about the Alamo than the actual history. The quality of the production is poor, making it seem like a project for actors who may not have had better opportunities. The biggest issue for me is that the actors chosen to play the real people from the Alamo don't seem believable at all.<br /><br />As someone from Texas, I grew up hearing the myths about the Alamo. Later on, I learned more about the true history. I can appreciate a good movie from either perspective, but this movie didn't give me a chance to enjoy it. Even older versions by John Wayne or Fess Parker had more life and were somewhat more accurate.<br /><br />This movie was very disappointing. I recommend avoiding it.",
    "This account offers a nuanced portrayal of the renowned and valiant siege of the Alamo during the Texan struggle for independence from Mexico. Notwithstanding certain inaccuracies, the depiction remains intriguing. The cast includes notable actors such as James Arness portraying Jim Bowie, Brian Keith as Davy Crockett, Alec Baldwin as Colonel Travis, and Raul Julia as General Santa Anna. Additionally, this made-for-TV endeavor features the talents of David Ogden Stiers, Kathleen York, and Jim Metzler. The original music composed by Peter Bernstein further enhances the production's quality.",
    "The film \"The Alamo: Thirteen Days to Glory\" is terrible. The acting is bad, it is overly patriotic, and lacks historical accuracy. There are a few decent moments but not enough to maintain interest due to its excessive length. Rating: 1 out of 10.",
    "Norman Maclean's story is a masterpiece, yet Redford's adaptation falls short as it includes mundane scenes of the Maclean brothers engaging in activities not present in the original narrative. Brad Pitt's portrayal of the character Paul Maclean is either comical or disheartening, depending on one's interpretation of the original story. Despite this, some scenes featuring fly casting are visually stunning. Tom Skerritt as the father and Craig Sheffer as Norman deliver strong performances, embodying a traditional sense of masculinity. The female characters in the film lack depth, which is unfortunate given Maclean's affection for women in his narrative.",
    "The scenic beauty in this film captivates the eyes, but sadly, that's where the excitement ends. Enduring a lengthy and monotonous narrative, one can't help but wish for a more thrilling storyline. The minister's failure to address his son's deviance from his teachings is a glaring misstep, making one question the characters' authenticity. The constant blasphemy from the minister's boys feels out of place, especially given their Presbyterian background. The protagonist, Paul, comes across as immature and self-centered, evoking more eye-rolls than empathy. Amidst the mundane backdrop, the tension between Paul and his Native American love interest hints at a more compelling narrative that remains unexplored. Ultimately, the film feels stagnant, with the minister's sons leading uninspiring lives in a sleepy town. Rather than endure this lackluster tale, one might find more enjoyment in a fishing show.",
    "This passage talks about the flaws in the movie \"A River Runs Through It,\" criticizing the lack of a compelling story despite its visually appealing aspects. The portrayal of the narrator/author as a character trapped in a narrow-minded, passive existence is highlighted, as he fails to understand his brother's motivations and lacks any sense of humor or joy in life. The movie is deemed predictable and not worth watching, ultimately receiving a low rating of 3 out of 10.",
    "This film lacked a compelling plot, making its lengthy duration feel unbearable. Despite only being 123 minutes long, it felt like enduring four hours of monotony. Not only was there a noticeable absence of conflict, but the overall narrative was uneventful. While I wouldn't label it as the worst movie I've seen, that title now belongs to \"The Fast And The Furious.\" This critique isn't from a viewer seeking only action-packed films, as I generally dislike modern action movies. This film falls far on the opposite end of the spectrum with its lack of substantial development. Despite its shortcomings, the scenery and costumes were commendable.",
    "While the movie showcases stunning scenery, it lacks a cohesive plot due to the absence of conflict. Despite its attempt to be artistic, the film fails to deliver a compelling storyline, prioritizing aesthetics over storytelling fundamentals. If you appreciate Montana scenery and fly fishing, you may enjoy this film for its visuals, but be prepared for the absence of a coherent narrative.",
    "This movie features stunning scenery but lacks a coherent plot. A plot requires conflict, which this movie fails to deliver. It spends two hours showcasing beautiful scenes without engaging in any meaningful activity. While the film attempts to be artistic, it overlooks the essential elements of storytelling. If you appreciate Montana scenery and fly fishing, you may enjoy certain aspects of this film. However, it lacks a cohesive narrative, so don't expect a compelling story.",
    "I'm sorry, I rated it a 1, which is reserved for movies that I either walk out on or fall asleep during. In this instance, I fell asleep 10 minutes before the movie ended because I was really bored and had no interest in finding out what happened next.",
    "Mann captures the Alberta Rocky Mountains exquisitely, while Stewart and Brennan deliver engaging performances. However, Hollywood's portrayal of a Mountie in Dawson City, Yukon dictating law enforcement and gunfights for control is far from reality. Canadian viewers may find the exaggerated plot either entertaining or disappointing.",
    "This is an action-packed Western movie set in the scenic Northwest and features James Stewart leading a talented cast. The movie showcases stunning scenery, great costumes, and plenty of action and adventure. Stewart plays a wealthy cattleman who faces off against a corrupt government in the old Northwest.\n\nThe main downside of the film is the portrayal of a stereotypical cynical character as the hero, a common trope in Hollywood. Despite this, Stewart's character is kind to his two partners, which adds depth to his credibility and likeability.\n\nHowever, his rude behavior towards others makes it hard to root for him or connect with his character fully. He resembles the one-dimensional characters seen in spaghetti Westerns, though not quite as extreme.\n\nNevertheless, the minor characters, including Walter Brennan, Royal Dano, Harry Morgan, and others, add enjoyment to the movie and make it worth watching.",
    "This sequel is an absolute disaster in the realm of movies. Once again, it fails to make any sense. The killer is back, gleefully taking lives for sport. However, this time around, the victims are the ones creating a film about the events of the original movie. This results in what can only be described as the most ludicrous film ever.\n\nAvoid watching this at all costs. If you value your time, stay far away from it. You'll find yourself questioning the director and anyone around you as to why this film was even made. It completely misses the mark by failing to blend the elements of horror, action, and crime that made the original a success.\n\nKeep this away from your children. Regardless of whether they are teens, young kids, or young adults, this movie will have an undesirable impact on them.",
    "Oh, the local Mexican television channel 5 presents a late-night lineup of horror movies every day at 2:00 a.m., drawing viewers with a collection of classic fright-fests ranging from the 1970s to the early 2000s. Yesterday's feature presentation was \"Return to Cabin By The Lake,\" a movie that left a lasting impression, though perhaps not for all the right reasons.\n\nThe original \"Cabin By The Lake\" was a notable cult favorite characterized by its low-budget charm and relative success among audiences. Unfortunately, its sequel falls flat, lacking the charm and intrigue of its predecessor. Rather than adding to the legacy of the original, this film comes across as dull, uninspired, and a failed attempt at recapturing the magic of the first installment—a sentiment that many viewers would share.\n\nThe movie's downfall can be attributed to its nonsensical plot, which fails on all fronts and comes across as a parody of the horror genre rather than a genuine contribution. Throughout its runtime, \"Return to Cabin By The Lake\" veers into soap-opera territory with its laughable dialogue, awkward cinematography, and uninspired direction, creating an unintentionally comedic effect that dampens any semblance of horror.\n\nIn light of these shortcomings, my sincere advice to fellow viewers would be to steer clear of this film at all costs. It is a cinematic misfire that offers little, if any, value to audiences, even those with a penchant for so-bad-it's-good filmmaking. Consider this a cautionary warning for those considering a late-night viewing choice that may not be worth the investment.",
    "Outlandish follow-up defies belief extensively as wicked sociopath Stanley Kaldwell makes a comeback by infiltrating a movie production based on his novel about garden drownings, cleverly masquerading as the second unit director he previously eliminated. The film playfully mocks the film industry, using a sardonic screenplay to lampoon dictatorial directors who engage in questionable relationships with their actresses to further their careers, while resenting any challenges to their dominance. Unfortunately, Brian Krause's exaggerated performance hinders the satire, rendering it jarringly forced. The narrative revolves around the power struggle between the volatile director, played by Krause, and the authoritative screenplay writer, Alison, portrayed by Dahlia Salem. Andrew Moxham portrays Paul Parsons, seeking vengeance for his sibling's murder featured in the first installment. The sequel capitalizes on dark humor by exploring the absurdity of a serial killer navigating a film set, with Stanley manipulating events to maintain control. As Alison uncovers Stanley's true identity, the film delves into her complex dynamic with the killer, adding a layer of irony to the dark comedy. The climax between Alison and Stanley culminates in an incredibly far-fetched resolution that challenges the audience's suspension of disbelief. Unlike its predecessor's sophisticated cinematography, the sequel employs superfluous techniques like odd camera angles and slow-motion effects, detracting from the overall impact. Overall, this follow-up falls short of the original's mark, with its humor coming across as less effective and more overt.",
    "\"Return to Cabin by the Lake lacked in quality, likely due to a low budget resulting in a mix of movie-quality and simple video camera shots within the same scene. The blend is odd and could have been improved by avoiding the 'home video' effect. If you have seen the original CBTL, it may be worth watching to compare the differences. However, if you haven't seen the original, watching this one first may make it seem too cheesy and turn you off from the original.\"",
    "This made-for-TV movie, while not reaching the standard of a feature film, offers moments of mild humor amidst its sub-par script and overly dramatic acting, common in lower-budget productions. However, a major flaw is the inconsistency in filming style, with most scenes shot on film, but occasional segments shot on video, resulting in a jarring contrast in picture quality and frame rates. While not the worst movie out there, this inconsistency detracts from its overall quality and makes it hard to recommend for viewing.",
    "If you're thinking of watching this film, I highly recommend thinking twice. I don't usually share my thoughts on TV shows, but this one left me feeling like I needed to do something worthwhile to shake off the disappointment. Criticizing all the flaws in this movie would be an endless task. Simply put, please avoid watching it. It was a total letdown for me, and I am certain you won't find it any different. Anyone praising this movie is either clueless or part of the marketing team. I can assure you, you'll regret watching it!",
    "I watched this on the Sci-Fi channel. It aired after the first movie. For some reason, this film managed to keep my interest. Please stop asking why. \n\nSpoiler alert: It was rather corny how the main character was roped into the movie-making process. In the initial film, he had a “reason” to commit the murders, but in this sequel, almost half of them seemed to lack purpose. Stanley killed the director and captured the co-writer due to creative disputes, but attempting to kill off the cast was nonsensical as without them, there would be no movie. Was the aim for the deaths to appear real? If it was a high-budget production, they should have utilized special effects. As expected, similar to the first movie, the captured girl manages to escape, Stanley gets injured, and mysteriously disappears. Wow, what a surprise (sarcasm). This sequel had potential, and what’s truly disheartening is that I would even consider watching “Cabin by the Lake 3”. The only redeeming factor is Judd Nelson, as he is the standout in this sequel.",
    "I watched \"Cabin by the Lake\" this afternoon on USA. Considering this TV movie was interesting enough to make me want to watch the sequel, I tuned in for the airing this evening. However, I was extremely disappointed. The excessive use of DV (digital video) shots left me perplexed as they seemed out of place and lacking a logical explanation within the plot. While the open ending of \"Cabin by the Lake\" was acceptable, the sequel's open ending felt ridiculous. The potential for a movie like \"Return of Return to The Cabin by the Lake\" to be enjoyable is slim, possibly only if aired against infomercials at 4 o'clock in the morning.",
    "This sequel falls short of the impact delivered by the original. Judd Nelson plays a murderous screenwriter who adopts various identities to bring his novel, CABIN BY THE LAKE, to life on screen. The film still features brutal killings, but it veers into a very tongue-in-cheek territory without offering much humor. The project feels rushed, and at times Nelson's performance comes across as overly exaggerated. The storyline revolves around a script going through revisions before production, and it's clear that this script should have undergone its own substantial rewrite.",
    "\"Return to Cabin by the Lake falls short of the original with only one main character returning. This lackluster sequel is not worth your valuable time. As a huge fan of the first film, I found the story and acting to be top-notch, but this installment failed to impress. It's comparable to disappointing sequels like those of Urban Legends and Blair Witch, but with even worse acting that rivals soap opera performances. Save yourself the disappointment and skip this film - it simply doesn't live up to its predecessor.\"",
    "Hedy Burress, who miraculously escaped the first movie's watery grave, is noticeably absent in part two. I anticipated her presence but was disappointed. Perhaps she should have met a fate similar to Friday The 13th Part 2. This film, similar to Scream 3 and Urban Legend 2, delves into the concept of movies within movies. However, my verdict is clear - the entire premise is pure garbage. I advise steering clear of this one.",
    "Viewers praising the title sequence of this film might make you think it's amazing, but trust me, it's actually embarrassingly bad. The story follows a RAF pilot who narrowly escapes death and ends up romantically entwined with an air traffic controller. Despite some strange homoerotic undertones, the movie clumsily addresses love and stereotypes in a convoluted way. The poor production quality, including bad editing and lighting, is overshadowed by the terrible script. The attempts at cinematic techniques like Technicolor and foreshadowing fall flat, making the overall experience more funny than anything else. While some beach scenes are visually appealing, the rest of the film goes downhill fast. It's so bad that it's almost comedic, which is the only positive thing I can say about it."
