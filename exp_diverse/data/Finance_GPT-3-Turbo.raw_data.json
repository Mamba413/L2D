    "Futures contracts are a member of a larger class of financial assets called derivatives. Derivatives are called such because their payoffs depend on the price of other assets (financial or real). Other kinds of derivatives are call options, put options. Fixed income assets that mimic the behavior of derivatives are callable bonds, puttable bonds etc.  A futures contract is a contract that specifies the following: Just like with any other contract, there are two parties involved. One party commits to delivering the underlying asset to the other party on expiration date in exchange for the futures price. The other party commits to paying the futures price in exchange for the asset. There is no price that any of the two parties pay upfront to engage in the contract. The language used is so that the agent committing to receiving the delivery of the underlying asset is said to have bought the contract. The agent that commits to make the delivery is said to have sold the contract.  So answer your question, buying on June 1 a futures contract at the futures price of $100, with a maturity date on August 1 means you commit to paying $100 for the underlying asset on August 1. You don't have to pay anything upfront. Futures price is simply what the contract prescribes the underlying asset will exchange hands for.",

    "\"At any given moment, one can tally the numbers used for NAV. It's math, and little more. The Market Cap, which as you understand is a result of share value. Share value (stock price) is what the market will pay today for the shares. It's not only based on NAV today, but on future expectations. And expectations aren't the same for each of us. Which is why there are always sellers for the buyers of a stock, and vice-versa.  From your question, we agree that NAV can be measured, it's the result of adding up things that are all known. (For now, let's ignore things such as \"\"goodwill.\"\") Rarely is a stock price simply equal to the NAV divided by the number of shares. Often, it's quite higher. The simplest way to look at it is that the stock price not only reflects the NAV, but investors' expectations looking into the future.  If you look for two companies with identical NAV per share but quite different share prices, you'll see that the companies differ in that one might be a high growth company, the other, a solid one but with a market that's not in such a growth mode.\"",
    "Chinese suppliers can quote their price in CNY rather than USD (as has been typical), and thus avoid the exchange risk from US dollar volatility- the CNY has been generally appreciating so committing to receive payments in US dollars when their costs are in CNY means they are typically on the losing end of the equation and they have to pad their prices a bit.  Canadian importers will have to buy RMB (typically with CAD) to pay for their orders and Canadian exporters can take payment in RMB if they wish, or set prices in CAD. By avoiding the US dollar middleman the transactions are made less risky and incur less costs. Japan did this many decades ago (they, too, used to price their products in USD).  This is important in transactions of large amounts, not so much for the tiny amounts associated with tourism. Two-way annual trade between China and Canada is in excess of $70bn.  Of course Forex trading may greatly exceed the actual amounts required for trade- the world Forex market is at least an order of magnitude greater than size of real international trade.

    "\"I read the post.  I read what **they said** about it.   Yet, that part makes **no sense**.  They keep talking about \"\"only avilable to members of the Florida Bar\"\" but stop and think about how that doesn't make sense.  Are they in a *florida* court or in a *federal* court?  Or an IP/administrative setting?    Some things they wrote suggests they're in a *federal* court.  But others things suggest they're in an administrative court related to IP.  For example, they talk about needing an attorney who can represent them in the Trademark/IP courts.  That sounds like patent prosecution - but that's typically just about getting the patent/IP stuff in the first place - and not so much after-the-fact stuff.  But then again, I'm not at all familiar with the area so I could be way off base.  The problem is: I shouldn't have to be speculating so much because their story sucked.  But patent litigation (for infringement for example) as far as I was aware, occurs in traditional district courts and so far as I am aware you don't need a special trademark/ip exam to sue on it.  By contrast, patent *prosecution*, which is getting a patent through the offices, requires that the attorney take the USPTO exam - to become a 'patent' attorney.  [link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USPTO_registration_examination).  Federal courts, if that's where they are, typically use PACER ECF/CM (case management web portal).

    "My super fund and I would say many other funds give you one free switch of strategies per year.  Some suggest you should change from high growth option to a more balance option once you are say about 10 to 15 years from retirement, and then change to a more capital guaranteed option a few years from retirement. This is a more passive approach and has benefits as well as disadvantages. The benefit is that there is not much work involved, you just change your investment option based on your life stage, 2 to 3 times during your lifetime. This allows you to take more risk when you are young to aim for higher returns, take a balanced approach with moderate risk and returns during the middle part of your working life, and take less risk with lower returns (above inflation) during the latter part of your working life. A possible disadvantage of this strategy is you may be in the higher risk/ higher growth option during a market correction and then change to a more balanced option just when the market starts to pick up again. So your funds will be hit with large losses whilst the market is in retreat and just when things look to be getting better you change to a more balanced portfolio and miss out on the big gains. A second more active approach would be to track the market and change investment option as the market changes. One approach which shouldn't take much time is to track the index such as the ASX200 (if you investment option is mainly invested in the Australian stock market) with a 200 day Simple Moving Average (SMA). The concept is that if the index crosses above the 200 day SMA the market is bullish and if it crosses below it is bearish. See the chart below:  This strategy will work well when the market is trending up or down but not very well when the market is going sideways, as you will be changing from aggressive to balanced and back too often. Possibly a more appropriate option would be a combination of the two. Use the first passive approach to change investment option from aggressive to balanced to capital guaranteed with your life stages, however use the second active approach to time the change. For example, if you were say in your late 40s now and were looking to change from aggressive to balanced in the near future, you could wait until the ASX200 crosses below the 200 day SMA before making the change. This way you could capture the majority of the uptrend (which could go on for years) before changing from the high growth/aggressive option to the balanced option. If you where after more control over your superannuation assets another option open to you is to start a SMSF, however I would recommend having at least $300K to $400K in assets before starting a SMSF, or else the annual costs would be too high as a percentage of your total super assets.",

    "First, to answer the question.  The benefit of a 401k is that you don't have to pay income tax on the money contributed nor do you pay capital gains tax on the money that accumulates.  You get that with the restriction that you can't willy nilly remove and contribute money to the account (and you are taxed on withdrawals, more severely if you do it before you are 65).  Similar sorts of restrictions apply to all retirement accounts which give tax benefits.  Now, for the 7000 not providing benefit.  Assuming a very modest 4% growth, over 40 years 7000 becomes 34,671. Not something to sneeze at (inflation, risk reward, blah, blah, blah, it is less than it looks, but 4% is really pretty low, the stock market averages anywhere from 7-&gt;10% and IIRC the bond market is somewhere around 5%).  Now, certainly, to avoid bankruptcy you should withdraw.  However, if it is possible, you will be best served by keeping the money in your 401k account.

    "The details of the 401(k) are critical to the decision. A high cost (the expenses charged within the) 401(k) - I would deposit only to the match, and I'd be sure to get the entire match offered. In which case, that $3000 might be good to have available if you start out with a tight budget.  Low cost 401(k) w/match - a no-brainer, deposit what you can afford.

    "\"Based on the conversations in the comments, I believe a pragmatic solution would be the best immediate course of action, while still working on the long term addiction issues. The first step is to get your husband to agree to give you all of his credit cards and let you manage the money for a set period of time, say 3 months, to see how it goes. (In my experience people are more likely to agree to being uncomfortable for a finite period of time, rather than indefinitely.) Step 2 is to provide him a means for making purchases on his own, but with a limited budget. Here are some examples: Perhaps a combination of the above options would work best. Another thing to consider is to set up alerts with your bank so that you are notified of certain purchases (or all) that are made by your husband. This varies by bank, but nowadays most will allow you to receive text/email immediately when the purchase happens, and can be set to certain amounts or categories. There is a definite psychological difference between, \"\"If I buy this, my spouse will find out at the end of the month and berate me.\"\" and \"\"If I buy this, my spouse is going to run in here in 30 seconds and berate me.\"\" The latter might actually be a deterrent on its own, and you may likely have the opportunity to undo the purchase if you wish to. As a side note, it's important to realize that the above suggestions are still allowing for some limited amount of enabling and temptation to occur. If the addiction is such that it is hazardous to one's health (for example drugs or alcohol addiction), then I don't believe this would be the best course of action. These suggestions are based on my impression that the biggest concern at the moment is financial, and I believe these ideas help to mitigate that. Good luck.\"",

    "So does a post-dated check have any valid use in a business or   personal transaction? Does it provide any financial or legal   protections at all? Yes, most definitely. You're writing a future date on the check, not past, to ensure that the check will not be deposited before that day. Keep in mind that this may change from place to place, since not every country has the same rules. In the US, for example, such trick would not work since the check may be presented any time and is not a limited obligation. However, in some other countries banks will not pay a check presented before the date written on it. While in the US the date on the check is the date on which it was (supposedly) written and as such is meaningless for obligation purposes, in many other countries the date on the check is the date on which the payment to be made, thus constitutes the start of the commitment and payment will not be made before that date. For example, in Canada: If you write a post-dated cheque, under the clearing rules of the   Canadian Payments Association (CPA), your cheque should not be cashed   before the date that is written on it. If the post-dated cheque is cashed early, you can ask your financial   institution to put the money back into your account up to the day   before the cheque should have been cashed.",

I'd have to log in to their site to find the cost of a \"\"bid\"\" for packages, but you can multiply the cost of a single \"\"bid\"\" by 2,118, add another £21.18, and you'll know what all \"\"bidders\"\" trying to receive this item paid - I'll bet the total is substantially more than £249.  People taking part in these scams obviously convince themselves that they are the \"\"clever\"\" ones who will get an item cheaply. Apart from the possibility that a single \"\"bidder\"\" can easily make more bids than the value of the item, if you think you are more clever than everyone else, you are kidding yourself. (If you think you are indeed more clever than everyone else, go ahead and donate your money to these companies).  The \"\"packages\"\" are most likely designed to give you the false impression that you get some value for money. Years ago when I checked a single bid was £1, but in bigger packages the bids would cost say 50 pence. They also want many bidders to make sure the number of bids will be high (although there is nothing other than the website's honesty that prevents them from automatically adding bids if an item would otherwise sell too cheap).  Just to clarify: These are not auction sites. In an auction, the highest bidder pays the price they bid, usually plus some commission (on eBay, the commission is paid by the seller), and gets the goods, while everyone else keeps their money. In this \"\"auction\"\", every bid costs money, and by increasing the bid by one penny each time they make sure there are usually thousands of bids. (They also offer the products at a \"\"reduced\"\" price if you don't \"\"win\"\" the auction; the reduced price is substantially higher than buying from the manufacturer or any reputable retailer directly).\"",

This supports the link between THC concentration and neurocognitive dysfunction. Residual effects, however, continued in subjects who no longer felt the drug's effect.

    "For the US government, they've just credited Person B with a Million USD and haven't gained anything (afterall, those digits are intangible and don't really have a value, IMO). Two flaws in this reasoning: The US government didn't do anything. The receiving bank credited the recipient. If the digits are intangible, such that they haven't gained anything, they haven't lost anything either. In practice, the role of governments in the transfer is purely supervisory. The sending bank debits the sender's account and the receiving bank credits the recipient's account. Every intermediary makes some money on this transaction because the cost to the sender exceeds the credit to the recipient. The sending bank typically receives a credit to their account at a correspondent bank. The receiving bank typically receives a debit from their account at a correspondent bank. If a bank sends lots of money, eventually its account at its correspondent will run dry. If a bank receives lots of money, eventually its account at its correspondent will have too much money. This is resolved with domestic payments, sometimes handled by governmental or quasi-governmental agencies. In the US, banks have an account with the federal reserve and adjust balances there. The international component is handled by the correspondent bank(s). They also internally will credit and debit. If they get an imbalance between two currencies they can't easily correct, they will have to sell one currency to buy the other. Fortunately, worldwide currency exchange is extremely efficient.",

    "\"I used to work for one of the three ratings agencies. Awhile ago. First: There are lots of different ratings. The bulk of ratings are for corporate debt and public finance. So senior debentures (fixed income) and General Obligations e.g. tax-free muni bonds, respectively. Ratings agencies are NOT paid by the investment banks, they are paid by the corporations  or city/ state that is issuing debt. The investment banks are the syndicate that pulls the transaction together and brings it to market.  For mortgage-backed securities, collateralized debt CDO-CLO's, all of which are fancy structured securitizations, well, that is a different matter! Those  transactions are the ones where there is an inappropriately close tie between the investment bankers and ratings agencies. And those were the ratings that blew out and caused problems.  Ratings agencies continued to do a decent job with what WAS their traditional business, corporate and municipal bond ratings, as far as I know.   What khajja said was 100% correct: S&amp;P's fees were paid by investors, the people who were purchasing the bonds, until about 50 years ago. Around the same time that McGraw-Hill purchased S&amp;P, in 1966, they departed from that model, and started charging the bond issuers for ratings. I don't know if that decision was driven by McGraw-Hill or not, though.  One more thing: Not all credit ratings agencies are paid by the issuers. One of the 10 NRSRO's (a designation given by the S.E.C.) is Egan-Jones. Their revenue comes from the investors, bond purchasers, not the companies issuing bonds, unlike the S&amp;P/ Fitch/ Moody's \"\"business model\"\". So there is an alternative, which I consider hopeful and reason not to totally despair.  EDIT: What xcrunna19 mentions is also totally accurate. The part about Nouriel Roubini (who is a professor at N.Y.U. or Columbia or such and a sensible though slightly high strung sort) is consistent with my impression. As for whether it would require government action to implement the changes advocated by Roubini, yes, I guess it would, but I don't know if the government would do that. It would be better if the credit ratings agencies would find their own way to a different, less conflicted payment-incentive model.  Keep in mind too that many of the provisions of Dodd-Frank have removed the existing regulatory requirements for credit ratings on bonds and other securities. This is the scary part though: There isn't anything to replace the credit ratings agencies, not at the moment, as far as I can tell! Eventually the government is supposed to come up with an alternative, but that hasn't happened yet. Which is better: Not requiring ratings at all, or the past situation of sometimes inflated ratings, which imparted a false sense of confidence? I don't know.\"",

    "I believe this argument is most often used when considering which debts to pay back first, or when there are other options available such as investment options, building up an emergency fund, or saving for a large purchase.  In that case, it's simply justifying making minimum payments and paying more over the life of the loan in exchange for larger liquidity in the present. Unfortunately, when it comes to choosing between which debts to pay (e.g. My mom pays more than the minimum on her car because she can't deduct auto loan interest, despite her mortgage carrying a higher interest rate), it's only beneficial if the tax savings offsets the interest savings difference. The formula for that is: tax bracket > (1 - (target loan interest rate / mortgage interest rate)) That said, most people don't think in the long term, either by natural shortsightedness, or by necessity (need to have an emergency fund).",

It's what yahoo told me, but other sources are saying that the beta of KORS is more like -0.01 or close to 0. Yes?   edit 2: Using -0.01 beta, I get a rdWACC of 2.2%. Now this seems more plausible.

You can claim it is all you want, but until you prove its faulty its not. And you yet to prove its actually faulty.   It's a sweeping generalization.

    "\"The question asked in your last paragraph (what's the downside) is answered simply; if you take out a loan and close the cards, that's a ding on your score because your leverage ratio on this portion of your credit jumps to 100% or more, and because you'll be reducing the average age of your lines of credit (one line of credit a few days old versus five lines of credit several years old each). If you take out the loan and don't close the accounts, it's one more line of credit, increasing your total credit, lowering your leverage, but making institutions more reluctant to give you any more credit until they see what you'll do with what you have. In either case, assuming you can get the loan at less than the average rate of the cards (that's actually not a guarantee; a lot of lenders will want APRs in the 20s or 30s even for a title loan or other collateralized loan), then your cost of capital will also go down. That gives you more of a gap of discretionary income that you can better use to \"\"snowball\"\" all this debt as you are planning. Another thing to keep in mind is that the minimum payment changes as the balance does. The minimum payment covers monthly interest at least, and therefore varies based on your interest rate (usually variable) and your balance (which will hopefully be decreasing). A constant payment over the current minimum, much like a more traditional amortization, would be preferable.\"",

When options are issued, they usually do have an expiration date by which you need to exercise if you want to buy the shares. There may be other conditions attached. For instance, whether the plan is about stocks or options, often there is a vesting schedule that determines when you become eligible to buy or exercise. When you buy the shares, they may be registered directly in your name (you might get a fancy certificate), or they may be deposited in an account in your name.

    "When you want to short a stock, you are trying to sell shares (that you are borrowing from your broker), therefore you need buyers for the shares you are selling.  The ask prices represent people who are trying to sell shares, and the bid prices represent people who are trying to buy shares. Using your example, you could put in a limit order to short (sell) 1000 shares at $3.01, meaning that your order would become the ask price at $3.01.  There is an ask price ahead of you for 500 shares at $3.00.  So people would have to buy those 500 shares at $3.00 before anyone could buy your 1000 shares at $3.01. But it's possible that your order to sell 1000 shares at $3.01 never gets filled, if the buyers don't buy all the shares ahead of you.  The price could drop to $1.00 without hitting $3.01 and you will have missed out on the trade. If you really wanted to short 1000 shares, you could use a market order.  Let's say there's a bid for 750 shares at $2.50, and another bid for 250 shares at $2.49.  If you entered a market order to sell 1000 shares, your order would get filled at the best bid prices, so first you would sell 750 shares at $2.50 and then you would sell 250 shares at $2.49. I was just using your example to explain things.  In reality there won't be such a wide spread between the bid and ask prices.  A stock might have a bid price of $10.50 and an ask price of $10.51, so there would only be a 1 cent difference between putting in a limit order to sell 1000 shares at $10.51 and just using a market order to sell 1000 shares and getting them filled at $10.50. Also, your example probably wouldn't work in real life, because brokers typically don't allow people to short stocks that are trading under $5 per share. As for your question about how often you are unable to make a short sale, it can sometimes happen with stocks that are heavily shorted and your broker may not be able to find any more shares to borrow. Also remember that you can only short stocks with a margin account, you cannot short stocks with a cash account.",
    "Disputing the remark seems unlikely to move your score, since it is just that -- a remark.  It's hard to say whether the scoring models can/do read the remarks and incorporate them (somehow) into the scoring metric itself.

In other words, is it showing as an open collection or some other status which would indicate the creditor still has a pending claim?  If so, disputing it might have some effect, although nobody would be able to tell you for certain or even how much your score might be affected. If, as you say, that account should have been part of the bankruptcy package then getting that corrected could be important enough to achieve what you're looking for.

The outstanding principal is the amount left or remaining balance. A program like GnuCash or Quicken makes doing the payment schedule, and applying payments relatively easy to handle.  Spreadsheets will require you to have 36 lines (3 years x 12 months) of payment and recalculation detail, but that shouldn't be too much work.

Once you have your emergency fund started, budget at least enough toward your 401k to capture any matching offered by your employer. Then use the snowball plan to pay off your debts.  (From what your post says, this does not apply to you, but you may have some small credit card debts taht were not discussed).  Earmark the 'extra' for the smallest debt first.  When that debt is paid, the 'extra' grows by the minimum payment of the smallest.  Thus the snowball grows as you pay off debts. Once the debts are gone, reward yourself, within reason (and without going into debt). Now shift your extra into fully funding your retirement savings.  Consult a financial advisor to help you plan how to distribute your retirement savings across the available retirement savings types.  They can explain why it's good to have some of your retirement savings funded from after tax income.  They can help you find the balance between pre- and post-tax funded accounts.   Eventually, you may come to the point where you're putting the max allowed into your tax advantaged retirement accounts.  At your age, this is a significant achievement.

As a frequent traveller, I recommend that you build some flexibility into your plans, especially during the winter. It is not always possible, but try not to need to be somewhere the day of or the day after your flight.  Try to book flights early in the day, as they are less likely to be delayed by problems in flights before them, and you have more options for rebooking.

    "\"From what I've heard in the past, debt can be differentiated between secured debt and unsecured debt.   Secured debt is a debt for which something stands good such as a mortgage on your house.  You have a debt, but that debt is covered by the value of an asset and if you needed to free yourself of the debt, then you could by selling that asset.   This is what is known as \"\"good\"\" debt.   Unsecured debt is debt that is incurred where the only thing that is available to pay it back is your income.  An example of this is credit card debt where you purchase something that couldn't be sold again to pay off the debt.   This is know as \"\"bad\"\" debt. You have to be careful about thinking that house debt is always \"\"good\"\" debt because the house stands good for it though.  The problem with that is that the house could go down in value and then suddenly your \"\"good\"\" debt is \"\"bad\"\" debt (or no longer secured).  Cars are very risky this way because they go down in value.  It is really easy to get a car loan where before long you are upside down.    This is the problem with the term \"\"good\"\" debt. The label makes it sound like it is a good idea to have that debt, and the risk associated with having the debt is trivialized and allows yourself to feel good about your financial plan.  Perhaps this is why so many houses are in foreclosure right now, people believed the \"\"good\"\" debt myth and thought that it was ok to borrow MORE than the home was worth to get into a house.  Thus they turned a secured debt into an unsecured debt and put their residence at risk by levels of debt they couldn't afford. Other advice I've heard and tend to agree with, is that you should only borrow for a house, an education and maybe a car (danger on that last one), being careful to buy a modest house, car etc that is well within your means to repay.   So if you do have to borrow for a car, go for basic transportation instead of the $40,000 BMW.  Keep you house payment less than 1/4th of your take home pay. Pay off the school loans as quickly as possible. Regardless of the label, \"\"good\"\" \"\"bad\"\" \"\"unsecured\"\" \"\"secured\"\", I think that less debt is better than more debt.   There is definitely such a thing as too much \"\"good\"\" debt!\"",
    "I am not a lawyer, but the big thing to consider would be how you would split the money should either of you decide you want to close the account (or, at least her/his portion of the account).  I suspect you'd also need to determine how to split the capital gains/losses for tax purposes.  I can't really see any benefit to a joint account, unless you needed her money to qualify for some of the lower cost funds, and even then the difference in cost would be fairly low, much lower than the cost of having to potentially hire a lawyer to sort out all the questions.",
    "\"Not knowing anything about your situation or what makes it so complex, I would have to agree with the other commenters.  If your accountant screws up your business goes under, but at least your personal finances are safe from that and you'll recover (unless all your wealth is tied up in your business).

Have you set up online bill pay with your bank, so that you can automatically pay all the bills when they arrive?

Again, I don't know your exact situation, but hopefully some of these suggestions help.  Once I started automating my savings and a lot of my bill paying, it gave me a lot of peace of mind.\"",

That being said, there are scenarios like what Peter K. mentioned in his comment, where you're purchasing the building and business outright, but the land it sits on is actually being leased from a separate land-owner.  You may also be seeing the business itself being offered as freehold or leasehold. In this case, you may be purchasing the business of the pub from a pub company, but the building the pub resides in is leased from a property owner.

If that were the case, then, well, I doubt the management would think the UK branch is operating on a healthy basis.  Also, the point the article is trying to make is the losses are *not* just from expansion into the market. No, Starbucks in the UK is healthy and profitable, and the debt costs are inflated by bringing in debt from abroad; debt that has nothing to do with the operating and expansion costs made in the UK, and yet it lowers their tax rate.  This moving around of debt is a scheme only suitable for large multinationals, and I think it's very fair to ask if your tax system should allow such practices.

    "Yes, it's a risk. To put it in perspective, If we look at the data for S&P returns since 1871, we get a CAGR of 10.72%. But, that comes with a SDev (Standard deviation) of 18.67%. This results in 53 of the 146 years returning less than 4%.  Now if we repeat the exercise over rolling 8 year periods, the CAGR drops to 9.22%, but the SDev drops to 5.74%. This results in just 31 of the 139 periods returning less than 4%. On the flip side, 26 periods had an 8 year return of over 15% CAGR.  From the anti-DS article you linked, I see that you like a good analogy. For me, the returns of the S&P over the long term are like going to Vegas, and finding that after you run the math of their craps (dice rolling game) you find the expected return is 10%. You can still lose on a given roll. But over a series of a larger number of rolls, you're far ahead.  To D Stanley - I agree that returns are not quite normal, but they are not so far off. Of the 139 rolling returns, we'd expect about 68% or 95 results to be 1 SDev away. We get 88 returns +/-1SDev. 2 SDevs? We'd expect only 5% to lie outside this range, and in fact, I only get one result on the low side and 4 on the high side, 5 results vs the 7 total we'd expect.

Since it's the same asset, its value should not vary across exchanges once you compensate for exchange rates, right?

Your second question concerns the -19% return calculated for the second quarter.  You seem to think this return is \"\"way-off\"\".  Not really.

Therefore, if I started with $100,000, added $10,000 in cash to the account, and ended up with $100,000 in my account, then my return would be a negative value since I lost the $10,000 that I deposited in the account.

    "\"Yes, your tax bracket is 25%.  However, that doesn't mean that your take home pay will be 75% of your salary.  There is much more that goes into figuring out what your take home pay will be. First, you have payroll taxes.  This is often listed on your pay stub as \"\"FICA.\"\"  The Social Security portion of this tax is 6.2% on the first $118,500 of your pay and the Medicare portion is another 1.45% on the first $200,000.  (Your employer also has to pay additional tax that does not appear on your stub.)  So 7.65% of your salary gets removed off the top. In addition to the federal income taxes that get withheld, you may also have state income taxes that get withheld.  The amount varies with each state. Also, the 25% tax bracket does not mean that your tax is 25% of your entire salary.  You step through the tax brackets as your income goes up.  So part of your salary is taxed at 10%, part at 15%, and the remainder is at 25%. The amount of federal income tax that is withheld from your paycheck is really a rough estimate of how much tax you actually owe.  There are lots of things that can reduce your tax liability (personal exemptions, deductions, credits) or increase your tax (investment income, penalties).

    "\"It's not usually apparent to the average consumer, but there's actually two stages to collecting a payment, and two ways to undo it.  The particular combination that occurs may lead to long refund times, on top of any human delays (like Ben Miller's answer addresses). When you pay with a credit card, it is typically only authorized - the issuing bank says \"\"I'm setting this money aside for this transaction\"\", but no money actually changes hands.  You'll typically see this on your statement as a \"\"pending\"\" charge.  Only later, in a process called \"\"settlement\"\", does your bank actually send money to the merchant's bank.  Typically, this process starts the same day that the authorization happens (at close of business), but it may take a few days to complete.  In the case of an ecommerce transaction, the merchant may not be allowed to start it until they ship whatever you ordered. On the flip side, a given transaction can be voided off or money can be sent back to your card.  In the first case, the transaction will just disappear altogether; in the second, it may disappear or you may see both the payment and the refund on your statement.  Voids can be as fast as an authorization, but once a transaction has started settlement, it can't be voided any more.  Sending money back (a \"\"refund\"\") goes through the same settlement process as above, and can take just as long.

    "\"While I agree that highly processed foods, including plant based meat substitutes, are probably not the best things we could be eating, damning them with scare words like \"\"chemicals\"\" is unhelpful and certainly doesn't account for the bigger picture.  All food is made of chemicals- water is a chemical, broccoli is full of various chemicals.  Looking at the specific nutritional profile of meat alternatives most of them fall somewhere between marginally better and no worse than meat based foods.  Getting protein from leafy greens, whole grains, nuts, and legumes would probably be better, but meat alternatives still make it easier for people to adopt plant based diets, and see them as viable, which is likely to have a positive health impact, or again at least be no worse than an omnivorous diet.  You also discount the non-health related reasons that people choose these options.  Many people may be choosing meat alternatives because of concerns over animal welfare or the environment.  Other people may simply like the taste- many options are different enough from meat to not be comparable from a taste standpoint, and many plant based meat alternatives are much better tasting than similar frozen convenience foods made from animals.\"",

    "My perspective is from the US. Many employers offer 401(k)s and you can always contribute to an IRA for either tax deferred or tax free investment growth. If you're company offers a 401(k) match you should always contribute the maximum amount they max or you're leaving money on the table.    Companies can't always support pensions and it isn't the best idea to rely on one entirely for retirement unless your pension is from the federal government.   Even states such as Illinois are going through extreme financial difficulties due to pension funding issues. It's only going to get worse and if you think pension benefit accrual isn't going to be cut eventually you'll have another thing coming. I'd be worried if I was a state employee in the middle of my career with no retirement savings outside of my pension.

    "If the IRA is costing you $100 a year, you should almost certainly transfer it to a cheaper provider, regardless of whether you're going to withdraw anything.  You can transfer the IRA to another provider that doesn't charge you the fees.  Or you can convert it to Roth and combine it with your existing Roth.  Either way, you will keep all the money, and save $100 per year in the future. If you want to take money out of your retirement accounts, you should take it out of your Roth IRA, because you can withdraw contributions (i.e., up to the amount you contributed) from the Roth without tax or penalty. Whether you should withdraw anything from your retirement accounts is a different question.  If you're already maxing out your Roth IRA, and you have sufficient retirement savings, you could just instead plow that $5500 into your student loans.  (If you can afford it, of course, it'd be better to just pay the $7500 from your income and still contribute to the retirement accounts.)

    "If the check is written as a check to BigCo, it is less clear how Jack can compensate himself for the equity sale. It is as if the equity was owned by the corporation, not by Jack. This is correct.  If the check is written to BigCo, then it is BigCo issuing new shares.  Jack doesn't compensate himself for the equity sale, as he didn't sell anything.  The company traded shares for money which it uses for expansion.  In the long term, the capital gain from expansion may exceed the value of a $200,000 no-interest loan to the company.   If the value of the company before investing $250,000 is $1 million, then the value after investing is $1.25 million.  So $250,000 is 20% of the value of the company.  BigCo should not give the buyer 25% of BigCo but only 20% in that example.  If it does give 25%, the buyer is getting a $312,500 stake for only $250,000.   With the other example, Jack sells 25% of the company for $250,000 from his personal shares.  This doesn't change the assessed value of the company, just Jack's stake.  Jack then loans the company $200,000.  This also doesn't change the assessed value of the company (at least in theory).  It gains $200,000 but has an offsetting debt of $200,000.  In net, that's no change.  Assets and liabilities balance the same.   So if you know that the assessed value of the company is $1 million and that the buyer is paying $250,000 for a 25% stake at that same valuation, then you know that the check is being written to Jack.  If the check is written to BigCo, then one or more of those numbers is incorrect.   The buyer could be getting a 20% stake.  The new value of the company after the investment is $1.25 million.   Or paying $333,333.33.  The new value of the company after the investment is $1,333,333.33.   Or BigCo could only be worth $750,000 before the investment.  The new value of the company after the investment is $1 million.   Or Jack is getting screwed, selling $312,500 in stock (25%) for only $250,000.  Jack's shares drop from being worth $1 million to only $937,500.  The value of the company is $1.25 million.   Or some combination of smaller changes that balances.",

    "Usually that is the case that when fixed rates are lower than the variable rates, it is an indication that the banks feel the next movement in rates could be down. You also need to look at the fixed rates for different periods, for example 1 year fixed compared to 3 year fixed and 5 year fixed rates. If you find the 3 and 5 year fixed rates are higher than the 1 year fixed rates this could be an indication that the banks feel rates will fall in the short term but the falls won't last long and will continue to rise after a year or so. If the 3 year fixed rates are also low in comparison, then the banks may feel that the economy is heading for a longer term down trend. The banks won't want to lose out, so will change their fixed rates on their perception of where they feel the economy is headed. Since your post in May 2011, the standard variable rate has since dropped twice (in November and December) to be at 7.30%. You will also find that fixed rates have also been dropped further by the banks, indicating additional future cuts in the variable rates. Regards, Victor",

If you buy a hybrid universal life policy, the premium and death benefit can be guaranteed to last until any age.

Consumers only looking for a longer duration have a more flexible choice with a new hybrid product that combines elements of both term life coverage and universal life. Hybrid universal  policies are much cheaper then other permanent coverage such as whole life coverage because they do not emphasize cash value accumulation. However, the premiums and death benefits can still be guaranteed to a specific age (i.e. 85, 90, 95, 100). So, premiums can be scaled to coordinate with your desired budget and the face amount required for your family. Typical universal life and whole life insurance contracts only allow for lifetime coverage. However, hybrid universal life offers a much smaller premium because the coverage can be dialed into a specific age. If the policyholder does live beyond the originally selected age, the death benefit will simply begin getting smaller, while the original premium will  continue to remain the same.",
    "20% is almost certainly too high. I agree with 2%, as a very rough rule. It will vary significantly depending on the industry. I generally calculate an average of the previous 2-3 years working capital, and deduct that from cash. Working capital is Current Assets less Current Liabilities. Current Assets is comprised of cash, prepaid expenses, and significantly, accounts receivable. This means that CA is likely to be much higher than just cash, which leaves more excess cash after liabilities are deducted. Which reduces EV, which makes the EV/EBITDA ratio look even more pricey, as Dimitri noted. But a balance sheet is just a snapshot of the final day of the quarter.

    "The answer to this question is related to another question: How would I invest in Uber? Given that Uber is a privately-held company, the average investor cannot directly buy stock.  However, there are some indirect methods that you can use to invest in Uber, and as a result, it is also possible to indirectly short Uber. One method is to invest in (or short) companies that invest in Uber.  Alphabet/Google (GOOG) owns some, as well as Microsoft (MSFT), Toyota (ADR), and other companies.  Theoretically, you could short these companies, as a hit to Uber would be bad for those companies. Another method would be to look at Uber's competitors.  Think about what companies would do well if Uber went under.  Lyft, perhaps, although it is so similar to Uber that if one has trouble, the other may as well.  Perhaps instead you might invest in a traditional taxi company, or a company that provides services to taxi companies, such as Medallion Financial Corporation (MFIN). Keep in mind that either investing or shorting any of these is not really the same as investing/shorting Uber.  It provides you some exposure in Uber, but your investment is also affected by many other things that have nothing to do with Uber.

    "Futures contracts belong to a category of financial assets known as derivatives. Derivatives are so named because their value is derived from the price of another asset, whether financial or tangible. Other common derivatives include call options, put options, callable bonds, and puttable bonds. A futures contract is a specific type of agreement involving two parties: one party agrees to deliver the underlying asset on the contract's expiration date at the agreed-upon futures price, while the other party agrees to pay this price in exchange for the asset. Unlike traditional contracts, no upfront payment is required to enter into a futures contract. In this context, the party receiving the asset upon expiration is said to have bought the contract, while the party making the delivery is said to have sold the contract. For example, if you buy a futures contract on June 1 at a price of $100 with a maturity date of August 1, you are committing to paying $100 for the asset on August 1 without an initial payment. The futures price represents the predetermined amount at which the underlying asset will change hands based on the contract terms.",

As per your query, it is evident that NAV can be quantified by summing up all known factors.

Put simply, the stock price not only mirrors the NAV but also encompasses investors' future outlook.

    "Chinese suppliers have the option to quote their prices in CNY rather than USD, a departure from the conventional practice. This allows them to mitigate the exchange risk stemming from the volatility of the US dollar. Given the general appreciation of the Chinese Yuan (CNY), suppliers find themselves in a disadvantageous position when committing to receiving payments in USD while their costs are denominated in CNY. Consequently, they often adjust their prices to compensate for this discrepancy. Canadian importers are required to acquire Chinese Renminbi (RMB), typically using Canadian Dollars (CAD), to settle their orders. On the other hand, Canadian exporters may opt to accept payment in RMB or set their prices in CAD. By circumventing the intermediary role of the US dollar, transactions become less risky and entail lower costs. This strategic shift mirrors the approach adopted by Japan several decades ago when they moved away from pricing their products in USD. This practice holds significant weight in high-value transactions, as opposed to the relatively minor impact on transactions in the realm of tourism.

    "Upon reviewing the post and their commentary, it is evident that there are inconsistencies and unclear statements that make it challenging to ascertain the actual circumstances. The mention of the exclusivity of services to members of the Florida Bar raises questions about the specific legal jurisdiction in which the situation transpires. The narrative appears to suggest involvement in either a federal court or an administrative domain related to intellectual property rights. However, the varying references within the text create ambiguity regarding the precise legal arena being discussed. For instance, allusions to the need for legal representation in trademark and intellectual property courts hint at patent prosecution, primarily focused on securing patents or intellectual property rights. This contrasts with typical patent litigation scenarios, such as infringement cases, which traditionally occur in standard district courts without requiring specific trademark or IP credentials to initiate legal action. Moreover, the distinction between patent prosecution and litigation is highlighted, emphasizing the role of a 'patent' attorney in navigating the complexities of securing patents through the USPTO examination process. \n\nThe mention of systems like PACER ECF/CM, common in federal courts for case management, raises further questions about the context of the narrative and the clarity of the information presented.

    "Many super funds, including mine, offer one complimentary strategy switch annually. A common recommendation is to transition from a high growth option to a more balanced one about 10 to 15 years before retirement, and then to a capital guaranteed option closer to retirement. This method involves changing your investment choice based on your life stage, typically 2 to 3 times throughout your career. It allows for higher risk investments in youth for potential higher returns, a balanced approach in mid-career for moderate risk and returns, and lower risk investments with moderate returns in later stages. However, a drawback of this approach is potentially switching to a balanced option during market downturns and missing out on significant gains during market recoveries. An alternative active approach involves tracking the market and adjusting your investment accordingly. For example, using the ASX200 index with a 200-day Simple Moving Average to gauge market trends. A combination of both passive life stage-based adjustments and active timing strategies may be most effective, such as waiting for market signals before making planned shifts.

But if they are only a capital investor without any involvement in the company's operations, they may not be sued. In that case, our contract wouldn't be with them, right? \n\nIf the company you're working for goes downhill, you might think of suing them. However, if they have no money, what do you expect to gain? Keep in mind that registered owners of a corporation can also be held liable for its debts. You could also consider having them guarantee your back pay. And don't underestimate the value of your service—there are cases where company owners have agreed to personal liability guarantees. So, never say 'Nobody will ever do that!', because if your service is truly valuable, **YES, THEY WILL**. As proof, I once successfully obtained a personal liability guarantee from a company owner.\"",

Treasury Bonds are considered safe investments and are suitable in situations where cash isn't optimal. They usually carry a patriotic theme that supports national growth. Many investors focus on simply owning bonds rather than studying their rates. However, increased demand for bonds can lower yields. Despite this, I prefer a savings account over a negative interest rate. Judging from recent reports, it appears investing in Treasury Bonds may not be a wise choice.",
    "I operate in both markets and there are numerous factors to consider. Distribution costs in New York are extremely high. Each state has a unique energy generation mix, access to fuel, regulatory costs, taxes, availability of green/renewable energy, mandates, and types of restructuring (e.g., Texas is fully restructured while New York's market was only partially restructured and has encountered significant challenges). There are discussions about transitioning back to a fully-regulated model in New York.\n\nFor business customers, my key recommendations include: \n1. Conduct energy audits and review your processes/equipment to reduce unnecessary energy usage and avoid demand peaks.\n2. Avoid signing exclusive agreements with brokers; compare prices yourself and ensure transparency regarding broker fees.\n3. Analyze your energy usage history, especially demand, over the past year.

It’s a nice little perk, but there are some rules you gotta follow. For example, you can’t just take money out whenever you feel like it, and if you do decide to dip into your 401k before you hit 65, Uncle Sam might take a bigger chunk of it. \n\nNow, about that $7000 just sitting there not doing much. If you leave it alone and let it grow at a modest 4% rate for 40 years, it could turn into around $34,671. Not too shabby, right? But hey, there are some things to consider like inflation, risk, and other financial mumbo jumbo. \n\nIf you’re ever in a pinch and need some cash, it might be tempting to cash out your 401k.

    "Understanding the specifics of the 401(k) plan is crucial in making an informed decision. When it comes to high-cost 401(k)s, it's wise to contribute only up to the employer match and ensure you receive the full matching amount. Having $3000 available can be beneficial when starting on a tight budget. On the other hand, low-cost 401(k)s with a match are a straightforward choice - contribute what you can afford without much hesitation.\n\nFor Roth 401(k)s with a match, similar expense considerations apply. It's advisable to opt for Roth accounts when starting out or while in a lower tax bracket. Maintaining both traditional and Roth accounts is a sensible strategy. Notably, depositing funds into a Roth account entails minimal risk, as you can withdraw the contribution penalty-free if you change your mind the following year. \n\nRegarding your latest query about Roth deposits, it's important to understand the separate components involved. The initial deposit places your earned income of $3000 into a tax-sheltered account, while the investment decision follows. These steps can be taken sequentially, allowing you flexibility in your choices. The timing of dividends is insignificant in an IRA or 401(k) since they are not taxed, making it a non-issue. In a cash account, dividend timing may raise minor tax concerns, but this doesn't factor in when dealing with tax-deferred accounts.",

    "After reviewing the discussions in the comments, it appears that adopting a practical approach would be the most effective immediate strategy, all while addressing the underlying issues of addiction in the long term. A recommended initial step involves requesting your spouse to hand over all credit cards for a defined period, like 3 months, empowering you to oversee the financial management. My observation is that individuals are more inclined to accept temporary discomfort rather than an indefinite arrangement.\n\nThe next phase would entail granting your spouse a controlled allowance for personal expenditures, ensuring independence within set limitations. Potential methods include a combination of the aforementioned options. Furthermore, consider setting up transaction alerts with your bank, allowing you to be promptly notified of specific purchases made by your spouse. This feature can be customized to alert you of purchases immediately via text or email, based on designated thresholds or categories.\n\nThere exists a distinct psychological contrast between the repercussions of \"My spouse will find out at month-end and scold me\" and \"My spouse will confront me within seconds of the purchase.\" The latter scenario could serve as a natural deterrent, potentially giving you the chance to reverse the transaction. It is important to acknowledge that these suggestions may still expose some susceptibility to enabling behavior and temptation.\n\nIf the addiction poses a significant health risk, such as substance abuse, I recommend exploring alternative intervention strategies. These recommendations are tailored towards addressing immediate financial concerns, with the aim of providing practical solutions. Best of luck with the implementation of these suggestions.",

    "Why should wealthy individuals who buy expensive homes receive financial assistance from those who pay less or rent? When someone purchases a $500,000 house in an area with high property taxes, they benefit in two ways. Firstly, they can deduct more from their taxes compared to the average working-class person who buys a $250,000 house. Secondly, they enjoy better public services, like schools, funded by others. The soaring home prices in San Francisco are due to a mix of speculative investment and inadequate government regulation. This has led prices to reach levels similar to Tokyo despite a lower population density. This problem is caused by the failure of local governments to construct more homes, not by a lack of tax breaks. It's fair for a community to choose paying more taxes for enhanced local services, but this shouldn't be at the expense of those who prefer lower taxes. In my opinion, individuals should not be penalized for not owning property or residing in a state with different tax policies.",

    "The US government has simply credited Person B with a million USD, but in reality, those digits hold no intrinsic value. However, this overlooks the key fact that the government itself did not perform the transaction; it was the receiving bank that facilitated the credit. While the concept of intangible digits may seem devoid of tangible gain, it also avoids losses. In practice, governments act solely as overseers in such transfers. The sending bank deducts from the sender's account, while the receiving bank credits the recipient's account.\n\nEvery intermediary in the process profits, as the sender incurs a cost exceeding the credit received by the recipient. Sending banks gain credits in their correspondent bank's account, while receiving banks record debits from their correspondent bank's account. In some cases, banks may face issues with insufficient or excess funds in their correspondent accounts, which can be resolved through domestic payment channels, sometimes handled by government-related entities.\n\nIn the US, banks maintain accounts with the Federal Reserve to adjust balances.

    "I have extensive experience working for one of the top ratings agencies, offering valuable insights into the world of credit ratings. It is crucial to understand that the majority of ratings are assigned to corporate debt and public finance, focusing on senior debentures and General Obligations such as tax-free municipal bonds. Contrary to popular belief, ratings agencies are not paid by investment banks but rather by the corporations or municipalities issuing the debt.\n\nWhile the traditional business of corporate and municipal bond ratings has been fairly reliable, issues arose with more complex financial instruments like mortgage-backed securities and CDOs/CLOs where conflicts of interest between investment banks and ratings agencies led to inaccurate ratings and market disruptions. \n\nIt's worth noting that not all credit ratings agencies operate under the same payment structure. For example, Egan-Jones, one of the ten NRSRO's designated by the SEC, generates revenue from investors rather than bond issuers, offering an alternate business model that gives hope for unbiased ratings.\n\nThe industry has seen significant changes over the years, with S&P shifting from investor-paid to issuer-paid models in the past. While regulatory reforms like Dodd-Frank have relaxed requirements for credit ratings, the lack of a viable alternative poses challenges. The debate between the necessity of credit ratings and their potential for misleading investors underscores the need for a more transparent and accountable system.\n\nIn conclusion, the current landscape calls for a reevaluation of payment models within the ratings industry to ensure independence and accuracy.

    "The question in your last paragraph, \"what's the downside?\", has a straightforward answer. When you take out a loan and close your credit cards, your credit score takes a hit. This is because your leverage ratio on that part of your credit shoots up to 100% or more, and by closing the cards, you are reducing the average age of your credit lines. On the other hand, if you take out the loan but keep the accounts open, it adds another credit line, which can increase your total credit and lower your leverage. However, this could make institutions hesitant to offer you more credit until they see how you manage your current credit lines.\n\nRegardless of the approach you choose, getting a loan at a lower interest rate than your credit cards can reduce your cost of capital. This means you will have more discretionary income available to tackle your debt, following your snowball method. It's important to note that the minimum payment changes as your balance decreases. This payment covers at least the monthly interest, so it will vary based on your interest rate and decreasing balance. Opting for a fixed payment above the current minimum, similar to a traditional amortization, is generally a better strategy.",

It is important to acknowledge that companies may adopt either form of incentive scheme: one centered around stock issuance or an alternative that involves the provision of options, with the ultimate aim of facilitating the exchange of stock for the stipulated option exercise price. It is customary for options to bear a predetermined expiration date that mandates action if one wishes to proceed with the acquisition of shares, potentially subject to additional stipulations.\n\nMoreover, whether pertaining to stocks or options, a vesting schedule commonly governs the timing of eligibility for purchase or exercise. Following the acquisition of shares, they may either be formally registered in your name, possibly accompanied by an official certificate, or be securely stored in an account under your ownership.

    "When you decide to short a stock, you are essentially looking to sell shares you've borrowed from your broker, requiring interested buyers for the shares you're offering. The ask prices indicate individuals looking to sell shares, while the bid prices reflect those wanting to buy shares. For instance, by placing a limit order to short 1000 shares at $3.01, your order would establish the ask price at $3.01. If there is a preceding ask price for 500 shares at $3.00, those shares would need to be purchased first before your 1000 shares at $3.01 become available. However, if buyers do not acquire all shares ahead of yours, it's possible your order to sell at $3.01 may not be fulfilled, potentially causing you to miss out on the trade as the price drops without reaching $3.01. In the event you are keen on shorting 1000 shares, a market order could be used. For instance, if there's a bid for 750 shares at $2.50 and another bid for 250 shares at $2.49, selling 1000 shares through a market order would lead to selling 750 shares at $2.50 followed by 250 shares at $2.49. This is a simplified illustration for clarification purposes. In reality, bid and ask prices typically have a narrower spread. For example, a stock might have a bid price of $10.50 and an ask price of $10.51, resulting in just a 1 cent difference between using a limit order to sell at $10.51 and opting for a market order to sell at $10.50. It is worth noting that the presented example might not be feasible in real-world scenarios as brokers generally disallow shorting stocks trading under $5 per share. In terms of encountering challenges in making short sales, it can occur with heavily shorted stocks where your broker may struggle to locate additional shares to borrow. Additionally, remember that shorting stocks is exclusive to margin accounts and not applicable to cash accounts.",

    "Establish budget categories, allocate income to these categories upon receipt, and settle bills and expenses promptly. When managing debts, prioritize paying the minimum on each. Once all budgeted items are settled, identify the surplus amount, defined as the 'extra,' and direct attention to the following priorities in sequence: First, ensure your emergency fund reaches an optimal level equivalent to 3-6 months of living expenses, tailored to your comfort level. Following this, allocate a minimum contribution to your 401k to capture any potential employer matching. Subsequently, employ the snowball method to eliminate debts, starting with the smallest balance. While your situation may not align with tackling credit card debts mentioned in your post, allocate the 'extra' amount towards the smallest debt initially. As each debt is cleared, the 'extra' allocation swells by the amount of the smallest debt's minimum payment, thereby accelerating the debt repayment process. Upon achieving a debt-free status, treat yourself within reason, without incurring additional debts, before reallocating the 'extra' towards fully funding your retirement savings. Seek guidance from a financial advisor to craft a comprehensive retirement savings plan that conforms to the assortment of available savings avenues. Understanding the importance of diversifying between pre-and post-tax funded accounts, a financial advisor can replicate a suitable balance across these accounts. With persistence, you may eventually reach the pinnacle of maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged retirement accounts, signifying a notable accomplishment at your age. Any residual funds post-retirement savings allocation may be utilized at your discretion, potentially fostering wealth accumulation and towards eventual financial independence.

Frequent travelers might find it less worthwhile, as the accumulated insurance costs could exceed the value of potential canceled trips. As someone who travels often, I suggest allowing flexibility in your plans, especially during winter. Booking early morning flights reduces the likelihood of delays inspired by earlier flight issues and offers better rebooking options. Flight delays due to weather or mechanical problems are common in today's busy industry, making prompt rebooking a challenge.

    "In the past, I have learned that debt can be classified as secured debt or unsecured debt. Secured debt is backed by an asset, such as a mortgage on a house, which ensures that the debt can be covered by the asset's value. This is commonly referred to as \"good\" debt. On the other hand, unsecured debt is not backed by any asset and can only be paid back using your income, like credit card debt. This type of debt is often seen as \"bad\" debt because there is no collateral securing it.\n\nIt is important to note that not all debt labeled as \"good\" may always remain so, as the value of assets like houses or cars can decrease, turning secured debt into unsecured debt. Therefore, it is crucial to borrow wisely for essential expenses like housing, education, and possibly a car, ensuring that the borrowed amount is manageable and within your financial means. Prioritizing the repayment of loans promptly and avoiding excessive borrowing is recommended to maintain a healthy financial status. Ultimately, having less debt is typically more favorable than accumulating excessive amounts of so-called \"good\" debt.",

    "Can I purchase VUSA from one exchange and then sell it on another exchange, assuming my brokerage provides access to both exchanges, or is it restricted to the original exchange? This ability varies depending on the specific securities and stock exchanges, and is subject to the policies of the broker and country. For example, Selftrade explicitly prohibited me from trading VUSA on different exchanges and allowed transactions only within the same currency and exchange. This restriction likely applies across brokers for retail investors, although exceptions may exist for institutional investors. Notably, VUSA is listed in GBP on the LSE and in EUR on the AEX, with the ETF being issued by an Irish entity and bearing an Irish ISIN. While cross-listing does occur between certain exchanges, like those in the US and Canada, it may not be universally permitted. Inter-listed stocks, for instance, cannot be traded between the LSE and NYSE.\n\nThe value of the asset should theoretically remain consistent across exchanges after accounting for exchange rates, as any discrepancies would offer opportunities for arbitrage. Yet, exploiting such differences has become increasingly challenging given the swift actions of automated trading systems that quickly correct any imbalances.\n\nIf currency risk is eliminated, other considerations when selecting an exchange for trading include liquidity, time zone differences affecting market access, tax implications spanning multiple jurisdictions, legal protections for investors, the availability of brokers facilitating trades in desired markets, and regulatory compliance requirements.",

Despite this, present-day investors still regard gold as a valuable asset, often turning to it for secure safekeeping or risk diversification.\n\nWhile gold continues to hold a place as a currency alternative, Graham's philosophy reminds us that investing in currencies or commodities may not align with his teachings. How can one determine the intrinsic value of a currency or commodity reliably, in a manner that embodies Graham's principle of having a safety margin built-in? Broad statements like \"gold is a steal in today's market\" fall short of the rigorous analysis Graham championed. Instead, a meticulous examination akin to Graham's \"net net\" approach, which evaluates stocks based on tangible assets minus liabilities, promises a deeper understanding and a genuine margin of safety.",
    "Many partnership agreements contain a provision known as a shotgun clause, where one partner sets a price and the other can choose to buy at that price or sell their share at the same value. This clause can be quite aggressive as it allows for strategic offers that undervalue the company, especially if one partner relies heavily on the other to run the business. In this scenario, a partner is requesting a buyout for a specific amount, but if that is not agreed upon, they propose keeping their ownership while having their spouse take over their responsibilities. If this arrangement is feasible, with the partner contributing to the vision while the spouse handles day-to-day operations, it could be a wise decision to maintain the status quo. However, if this arrangement is not viable, it does not mean that the buyout should be at an inflated price. Without a clear partnership agreement in place, decision-making can be challenging. One tactic could be to simulate a shotgun clause by asking the partner if they believe that half the company is worth the specified amount and if they would be willing to buy out the other partner at that valuation, with their spouse taking over the role independently. This conversation could lead to a negotiation based on the true value of the company.",

    "Simply contributing capital to the company is not a taxable event. As the owner, providing a loan would be beneficial only if you wish to earn interest from the company, especially when partners are not providing loans. Opting for a loan would allow you to receive compensation for lending, although the interest earned would be considered taxable income for you (as indicated by a 1099-INT form), and can be expensed by the company. On the other hand, a capital contribution is a simpler process, and you can withdraw funds later as a distribution to receive payment without being taxed. These transactions do not incur tax, but you are unable to receive interest.",
    "The Time-Weighted Rate of Return (TWRR) is calculated with the formula TWRR = (1 + 0.10) x (1 - 0.191) x (1 + 0.29) ^ (1/3) = 1.047, which translates to a return of 4.7%. Your concern about the -19% return for the second quarter is reasonable. The TWRR considers cash additions or withdrawals from the account when calculating returns. For instance, if you started with $100,000, added $10,000, and ended with $110,000, the return would be 0% because the increase was solely due to the cash deposit. On the other hand, if you started with $100,000, added $10,000, and ended back at $100,000, your return would be negative because you lost the $10,000 added. In the second quarter scenario, starting with $15,000, depositing $4,000, and ending with $15,750 resulted in almost all of the $4,000 deposit being lost, indicating a significant loss.",
    "Your tax bracket is 25%, but that doesn't mean your take-home pay will be 75% of your salary. Several factors determine your take-home pay. Firstly, there are payroll taxes, commonly listed as \"FICA\" on your pay stub. The Social Security tax is 6.2% on the first $118,500 of your pay, and the Medicare tax is 1.45% on the first $200,000. Your employer also pays additional taxes not listed on your stub, reducing your salary by 7.65%. Apart from federal income taxes, you may also have state income taxes withheld, the amount varying by state.\n\nThe 25% tax bracket does not mean that your entire salary is taxed at 25%. Income is taxed based on different brackets - part at 10%, part at 15%, and the remainder at 25%. The federal income tax withheld from your paycheck is an estimate of your tax liability. Factors like personal exemptions, deductions, and credits can decrease your taxes, while income from investments and penalties can increase them.\n\nWhen you file your tax return, you calculate your actual tax owed. If too much tax was withheld, you receive a refund. If too little was withheld, you need to pay the remaining amount.",

In the 1970s, the company made changes to their beer production process to increase profitability.

As a result, the beer's consistency suffered, resembling \"snot\" at times. While short-term profits rose, long-term customers turned away from the brand.

    "If the check is made out to BigCo, things get a little fuzzy on how Jack gets compensated for the equity sale. It's like the corporation owns the equity, not Jack. That's not the vibe we're going for! \n\nIn reality, if the check is addressed to BigCo, it means BigCo is issuing new shares. Jack isn't cashing in on the equity sale directly because he didn't sell anything. The company is trading shares for money to fuel its growth. Looking at the bigger picture, the gains from this expansion could surpass the benefits of a $200,000 no-interest loan to the company.\n\nLet's crunch the numbers! With a pre-investment company value of $1 million, investing $250,000 pushes the value to $1.25 million. That $250,000 represents 20% of the company value. So, giving the buyer 25% would be overdoing it. They'd be snagging a $312,500 stake for just $250,000. \n\nIn another scenario, Jack offers a 25% stake for $250,000 from his personal shares. This move alters Jack's stake but doesn't affect the company's assessed value. Jack then loans the company $200,000, balancing out assets and liabilities. The result? No change in the grand scheme of things.\n\nSo, if you're aware of the company's $1 million valuation and see a $250,000 payment for a 25% stake, that check is meant for Jack. Giving it to BigCo means something isn't adding up. Maybe the buyer ends up with a 20% stake, or the company's new value post-investment is $1.25 million or $1,333,333.33. Or, if BigCo was initially valued at $750,000, post-investment value reaches $1 million.\n\nWe don't want Jack to get the short end of the stick—selling $312,500 of stock for just $250,000 isn't cool. His shares drop to $937,500 from $1 million, even though the company value climbs to $1.25 million. It's all about finding the right balance! Let's keep this transaction lively and fair.",

    "Consider the following revised version:\n\nFor individuals seeking shorter-term life insurance coverage options, hybrid life insurance can be a beneficial solution. By opting for a hybrid universal life policy, individuals can secure a guaranteed premium and death benefit until a specific age, offering a flexible and more affordable alternative compared to traditional permanent life insurance options. Unlike most permanent policies that prioritize cash value accumulation, finding cost-effective whole life or universal life coverage can be challenging. However, the innovative hybrid product combines elements of term life coverage with universal life, making it a cost-effective choice for those in need of coverage for a specific duration. These hybrid policies are generally more economical than traditional permanent coverage like whole life insurance due to their reduced emphasis on cash value accumulation. Yet, they still provide the assurance of guaranteed premiums and death benefits up to a designated age (e.g., 85, 90, 95, 100), allowing individuals to tailor their premiums to align with their financial plan and family's needs. While conventional universal life and whole life insurance contracts typically offer lifetime coverage only, hybrid universal life presents a more budget-friendly option by allowing coverage until a specified age. Should the policyholder exceed the chosen age threshold, the death benefit may decrease, while the original premium remains constant, offering a practical and sustainable risk management solution.",

However, you can consider indirect methods such as investing in (or shorting) companies that invest in Uber, like Alphabet/Google (GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Toyota (ADR), and others. Another approach is to look at Uber's competitors, such as Lyft, traditional taxi companies, or companies that provide services to taxi companies like Medallion Financial Corporation (MFIN). Keep in mind that while these methods provide exposure to Uber, your investment is also influenced by factors unrelated to Uber. For more insights, refer to the Investopedia article \"Ways to Invest in Uber before It Goes Public,\" although it's advisable to carefully consider the risks involved before proceeding with any investments."
