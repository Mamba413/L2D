    "If you decide to eat here, just be aware it is going to take about 2 hours from beginning to end. We have tried it multiple times, because I want to like it! I have been to it's other locations in NJ and never had a bad experience.   The food is good, but it takes a very long time to come out. The waitstaff is very young, but usually pleasant. We have just had too many experiences where we spent way too long waiting. We usually opt for another diner or restaurant on the weekends, in order to be done quicker.",
    "I've taken a lot of spin classes over the years, and nothing compares to the classes at Body Cycle. From the nice, clean space and amazing bikes, to the welcoming and motivating instructors, every class is a top notch work out.  For anyone who struggles to fit workouts in, the online scheduling system makes it easy to plan ahead (and there's no need to line up way in advanced like many gyms make you do).  There is no way I can write this review without giving Russell, the owner of Body Cycle, a shout out. Russell's passion for fitness and cycling is so evident, as is his desire for all of his clients to succeed. He is always dropping in to classes to check in/provide encouragement, and is open to ideas and recommendations from anyone. Russell always wears a smile on his face, even when he's kicking your butt in class!",
    "Family diner. Had the buffet. Eclectic assortment: a large chicken leg, fried jalapeño, tamale, two rolled grape leaves, fresh melon. All good. Lots of Mexican choices there. Also has a menu with breakfast served all day long. Friendly, attentive staff. Good place for a casual relaxed meal with no expectations. Next to the Clarion Hotel.",
    "Wow!  Yummy, different,  delicious.   Our favorite is the lamb curry and korma.  With 10 different kinds of naan!!!  Don't let the outside deter you (because we almost changed our minds)...go in and try something new!   You'll be glad you did!",
    "Cute interior and owner (?) gave us tour of upcoming patio/rooftop area which will be great on beautiful days like today. Cheese curds were very good and very filling. Really like that sandwiches come w salad, esp after eating too many curds! Had the onion, gruyere, tomato sandwich. Wasn't too much cheese which I liked. Needed something else...pepper jelly maybe. Would like to see more menu options added such as salads w fun cheeses. Lots of beer and wine as well as limited cocktails. Next time I will try one of the draft wines.",
    "I am a long term frequent customer of this establishment. I just went in to order take out (3 apps) and was told they're too busy to do it. Really? The place is maybe half full at best. Does your dick reach your ass? Yes? Go fuck yourself! I'm a frequent customer AND great tipper. Glad that Kanella just opened. NEVER going back to dmitris!",
    "Loved this tour! I grabbed a groupon and the price was great. It was the perfect way to explore New Orleans for someone who'd never been there before and didn't know a lot about the history of the city. Our tour guide had tons of interesting tidbits about the city, and I really enjoyed the experience. Highly recommended tour. I actually thought we were just going to tour through the cemetery, but she took us around the French Quarter for the first hour, and the cemetery for the second half of the tour. You'll meet up in front of a grocery store (seems strange at first, but it's not terribly hard to find, and it'll give you a chance to get some water), and you'll stop at a visitor center part way through the tour for a bathroom break if needed. This tour was one of my favorite parts of my trip!",
    "Amazingly amazing wings and homemade bleu cheese. Had the ribeye: tender, perfectly prepared, delicious. Nice selection of craft beers. Would DEFINITELY recommend checking out this hidden gem.",
    "This easter instead of going to Lopez Lake we went to Los Padres National Forest which is really pretty but if you go to white rock the staff needs to cut down all the dead grass that invades the rock and the water. I would wish the staff would also clean or get rid of the dead grass that's also living by the water. The water is really green and dirty. Los padres national forest staff need to work hard to maintain this forest looking pretty and not like a dumpster. Even Cachuma lake looks like they put a bit more effort.",
    "Had a party of 6 here for hibachi. Our waitress brought our separate sushi orders on one plate so we couldn't really tell who's was who's and forgot several items on an order. I understand making mistakes but the restaraunt was really quiet so we were kind of surprised. Usually hibachi is a fun lively experience and our  cook  said maybe three words, but he cooked very well his name was Francisco. Service was fishy, food was pretty good, and im hoping it was just an off night here. But for the money I wouldn't go back.",
    "My experience with Shalimar was nothing but wonderful.  I wanted to get my engagement ring sized and was told over the phone that it could probably be done within the day.  When I brought it by, the team confirmed that the jeweler would be able to accommodate my same-day request and that it would be around $40 (simple band, decrease by three full sizes). I checked my size one more time, confirmed, and left to let them do their thing. When I came to pick up later that afternoon, the ring was too small. It's very important to note that Shalimar sized the ring perfectly, but that I made a mistake and should've gone up a half-size. The Shalimar group were completely understanding and accommodating, even resizing my ring back up and getting it back to me within an hour at no charge! Even though it was my mistake! The associates' attitudes in dealing with what was a pretty embarrassing situation instantly earned my satisfaction and loyalty as a customer. Very grateful for such a wonderful experience.",
    "Locals recommended Milktooth, and it's an amazing jewel of Indianapolis. I'm glade I had the chance to experience this.",
    "Love going here for happy hour or dinner!  Great patio with fans to beat the StL heat!   Also...very accomodating at this location.  I like the Veal Milanese but with mixed greens instead of pasta!  they'll modify the menu to suit your taste!",
    "Good food--loved the gnocchi with marinara the baked eggplant appetizer was very good too  The service was very slow, but despite this, I'd go back, the food is just that good",
    "The bun makes the Sonoran Dog. It's like a snuggie for the pup. A first, it seems ridiculous and almost like it's going to be too much, exactly like everyone's favorite blanket with sleeves. Too much softness, too much smush, too indulgent.  Wrong. It's warm, soft, chewy, fragrant, and it succeeds where other famed Sonoran Dogs fail.   The hot dog itself is flavorful, but I would prefer that it or the bacon have a little more bite or snap to better hold their own against the dominant mustard and onions.   I'm with the masses on the carne asada caramelo. Excellent tortilla, salty, melty cheese, and great carne.   Super cheap and you can drive through.",
    "Great place for breakfast! I had the waffle, which was fluffy and perfect, and home fries which were nice and smashed and crunchy. Friendly waitstaff. Will definitely be back!",
    "Tremendous service (Big shout out to Douglas) that complemented the delicious food. Pretty expensive establishment (40-50$ avg for your main course), but its definitely backs that up with an atmosphere that's comparable with any of the top tier restaurants across the country.",
    "The hubby and I have been here on multiple occasions and we have loved every part of the meal, every single time. Everyone from the servers to the bartender is very knowledgable about the menu and was able to immediately recommend items I could eat as-is, substitute or delete to make something safe for this Celiac girl to eat. The wine and cocktail menus are spot on. The food divine.  My only wish is that they would have a gluten-free dessert, we've always had to go elsewhere for something sweet. But that is not a big deal and I still want to go here time and time again.",
    "I go to blow bar to get my brows done by natalie (brow specialist) which i highly recommend she is great does a great job on my eyebrows! But then i got a blow by victoria!! Wow i was impress i have thin, straight, dead hair and she left me with the biggest volume ive ever had!!! Tried another girl but didnt like it as much so victoria will be my girl for ever; very beautiful clean place!!!",
    "My absolute favorite cafe in the city. Their black and white latte is probably the best I've ever had (not too sweet and just the right amount of foam), soups are always really good (even for non-soup people) and there's just a lot of space to do work. The noise level is perfect, the music is at a perfect level, and I always enjoy when patrons bring their dogs. I'll keep giving them my business for as long as I can.",
    "HOLY SMOKES!  actual pumpkin pie mixed in with the frozen custard......are you kidding me? Why hasn't this become a huge sweep the nation treat.   The best part was the chunks of pie crust. Like finding a diamond inside another diamond. Super yummy.",
    "Upland is a brewery based out of Bloomington, Indiana that has become popular enough to open up a couple additional locations in central Indiana.  All of their beers are very good, and I am also a fan of their burgers and tenderloins.  Therefore, I was excited to try their pizza, but I don't think it ended up being on par with these other items.  My margherita pizza had a cracker-like crust and was pretty light overall.  The cheese was good, but none of the other toppings added much flavor.  There was no red sauce as is typical for a true margherita pizza.  My opinion is that Upland's pizza might serve as a nice appetizer for a group, but I'll be sticking with their burgers or tenderloins as my meal of choice on future visits.",
    "I thoroughly enjoyed the show.  Chill way to spend a Friday night.",
    "Yes, this is the only sushi place in town. However, it is great when you're craving sushi and don't have time to go somewhere else. The salmon is probably the best fish they have, so we always order salmon. We also love their spicy edamame, tempura, ocean salad, and cabbage salad. Service has always been friendly and quick!",
    "I was really between 3 and 4 stars for this one. I LOVE the 96th street Naked Tchopstix so I was very excited to see this one which is closer to my house. The vibe is totally different as this is geared more to take out although they do have a decent size dining area. You order at the counter and they deliver it. My daughter and I tried the sushi bowl. You pick up a piece of paper and  select from a choice of proteins, vegetables, rice and toppings. I like the fact that it is on paper and you don't have to guess what things are or have to shout over the counter to tell the server what you want. The sushi bowl was good but not wonderful. The choices particularly of the vegetables seemed a little too limiting and I felt I had more rice than other food items. The sauces were tasty. My husband ordered the Maui roll which is my favorite roll at the 96th street location and this just was not up that standard. It was good but the quality and consistently was not as good as at 96th street. I would go back though and I think a lot of people would be happy with the sushi bowls. I do want to make a comment about the low reviews that people have given the place because of service. People - it is a sushi place - it isn't McDonalds- so it will be a bit slower. You are not going to order and get out of there in five minutes even though it is called express. As a healthy alternative to fast food in the area, it is worth the wait. Oh and try the bubble tea. I had the strawberry and it was quite yummy. Next time I am going to try the vanilla chai.",
    "Went for lunch. Beef brisket sandwich was awesome.   So juicy and tender.    Pulled pork was was just as good!",
    "Best thai food in the area.  Everything was authentic and delicious.  Will definitely be back again and again.",
    "Service was crappy, and food was mediocre.  I wish I would have picked some other place for my last dinner in town.",
    "I recently had dinner here with my wife over the weekend and could not have been more pleased!   Our meal was excellent! My wife and I were astounded by how quickly our food came out! Everything tasted fresh and homemade which we both appreciated.   The only problem was trying to pick something from the menu as there were too many delicious sounding items to choose from. We will definitely be returning to try more items! Can't wait to see what the next chef specials will be!",
    "I at least have to give this restaurant two stars due to the decent food. But while on a dinner meeting and after spending $100 on entrées and appetizers, I had to flag down the assistant cook, (the guy in bright red baggy pants watching TV), to see if I could get more avocado for my tuna entrée.  He made it very apparent and direct that he could not help me with that situation and I would have to flag down my  waitress so she could bill me for the four dollar avocado.",
    "First time there and it was excellent!!! It feels like your are entering someone's home. The waiters there funny and nice. The food come out very quickly and it is phenomenal!!! Definitely will be going back to this place.",
    "Great burgers,fries and salad!  Burgers have a hint of salt and pepper flavor.  This location is very quaint. They only have outdoor seating  Friendly staff.  Street parking as well as parking lot in the back.",
    "Great staff always helps and always nice. Always clean and huge store size. Stays stocked with everything you need. The staff always helps make my custom breakfast bagel",
    "Took my vehicle here for some work a few years ago for a manufacturer recall. Problem went away and then started hearing another noise which I thought was related, but turned out was a completely different issue. Kevin and his mechanic lifted my car right up and fixed the issue FREE OF CHARGE even though I told them I'd pay. Outstanding individuals for doing that. Highly recommend!",
    "After my ROTD  yesterday of a different Sweet CeCe's location, I realized that I had never reviewed my local source!  Anyway, I love the product.  Love love love.  And I usually like their selection of toppings - good mix between healthy and not-so-healthy.  Sometimes the girls working there aren't really paying attention or are nowhere to be found.  Sometimes you have to remind them of their deals (like $5 Friday).  But I can't give it less than 4 stars because I just love it so much.",
    "What a great addition to the Funk Zone!  Grab a bite, grab some tastings, life is good. Right next door to the Santa Barbara Wine Collective, in fact it actually shares the same tables.  We had a fabulous savory croissant.",
    "Nice relaxing place to get a massage! Same day appointments are easy to come by! I have never been disappointed with any therapist I have had at the Center!",
    "We checked in around 2:30 pm.  Check-in was quick and easy with complimentary valet parking (always appreciated).  The Peppermill is huge and reminded us of the Caesars Palace in Las Vegas.  They have around eight restaurants on site offering almost any type of food you could want.  The casino area is huge, rivaling almost anything you could find in Las Vegas.  One thing we noticed is that many of the slot machines were noted as being penny machines, but when you actually started to play them you realized they had minimum bets of anywhere from 30 cents to $5.  Talk about false advertising!  We were in the Tuscany Tower on the 12th floor.  Our room had a nice view of the huge pool area.  Our room was large and featured free WiFi (likewise always appreciated), a huge bathroom area with large shower (with two shower heads), TV, a large jetted bathtub and a phone next to the commode.  There were dual sinks and lots of counter space.  Plenty of towels were supplied.  The roomy main area had a king bed with night stands, closet, TV, mini fridge, dresser with two drawers, a safe, table for computer or writing, complimentary bottles of water, and three nicely upholstered chairs and table.  The thermostat did a good job controlling the temperature and keeping it comfortable.  Staff were all courteous and helpful.  A very nice place and we enjoyed our stay.",
    "My boyfriend and I tried this deli for the first time today. I had a turkey, avocado & bacon panini and he ha a buffalo chicken wrap. We will definitely be returning. The wait for food wasn't too long, which is always appreciated during lunch hour. There was SO much to choose from. They have salads, soup, macaroni, sandwiches and hot food. I love a deli that has many options to choose from!",
    "Amazing biscuits and (fill in the blank). Great cocktails too. Highly recommended. A bit busy though.",
    "Food was good- atmosphere/decor is like a fishing lodge- menu is someplace between outback & bonefish. Went on a Groupon & all 3 of our meals & calamari appetizer that we ordered were cooked perfectly- we will def be back.",
    "Straight to the point, it's cheap, it tastes and feels cheap  The good: price, location, dessert (edible food items are: baked chicken, fried chicken, mashed potatoes, Salad bar lol, meat and cheese bar, ravioli, pizza) also our waitress was bomb af  The meh: behind counter meat slicing station, shrimp (not even deveined), Mexican station  The bad: breakfast -worst eggs ever, actually worst, eggs. Le Benedict can't even cut through ham or English muffin (tried on all 3 occasions), steak, shrimp again, hell breaded items can't even, don't even. Decor it's the 1970 nightmare you can imagine  Tried 3 times and failed",
    "The only reason I didn't give this restaurant a 5 star rating, is because of one single pretentious waiter. As a 4 night guest at Hotel Palomar, the location of the restaurant is an obvious plus. The first night of my stay, I met a coworker in the restaurant for a cocktail. When we arrived, the host staff were busy and not available, so we just walked in. The restaurant was not too busy, so we just looked at a small table next to the bar and proceeded to take a seat. A waiter came by and I quickly asked if we could have a seat, before sitting down and told him we'd only be having cocktails. He stumbled on his reply, and in an irritated/in-convinced tone, told me \"I guess it would be fine\" and basically just kept walking mid sentence. My guest and I brushed it off, and started having a conversation while looking at the drink menu. To make a long story short, he was distant and we both got the \"couldn't be bothered\" vibe from him. When it came to the bill, we asked if it could be split due to company transaction policies, and you would have thought asked him for some inconceivable task. We basically spent the rest of our night and elevator ride to our room in shock of the rudeness we had just experienced.   Although that situation left a bad taste in our mouth, and the night before we decided to avoid the restaurant, we decided to grab another cocktail and give this place one more try. After looking around and ensuring \"last nights waiter\" wasn't on shift, we walked over to the bar and started looking over the menu. Instantly, the bartender greeted us with pleasant small talk and made us feel 100% welcome. He asked about our day, recommended cocktails and was a completely genuine person. This guy (I think his name was Ben) is an absolute star! He gave us lessons on Whiskey, described how to make classic cocktails, and was 100% invested in our experience. This is exactly what a bartender at a 4/5 star establishment should be - actually he exceeds that. He was kind, funny, friendly and completely redeemed this restaurant/bar from our terrible experience the night before.  I also ordered room service last night from this restaurant, and it was amazing. The bacon wrapped dates and chocolate cake are to die for! Great restaurant and amazing bartender(s). Too bad one bad egg could have spoiled this experience.",
    "Stopped by after a Sunday morning walk in the park - great food, coffee customer service - love the vibe in here",
    "In a word... \"OVERRATED!\".  The food took forever to come out.  The burger was WAY overcooked (Especially when I ordered it Medium Rare) and the Seafood Jumbalaya was Decent.  Not worth the price.  There are better places to eat in the french quarter.  It was not horrible, but for everything that we had heard about this place, I would have expected much better.",
    "Comfortable bed, good breakfast, fast internet, great location, and low price. Overall I was really impressed with this place. However, if you stay on the top floors you may be waiting up to 15 minutes for an elevator in the morning.",
    "NEVER AGAIN. This is a so called restaurant that does nothing that a restaurant should other than prepare food, because the rest is done by the patron. Want water? Get up and go across the yard to get it. Want a drink, walk up a flight of stairs and pay cash. Want to sit in a dirty yard in dirty lawn chairs, enjoy yourself. The wait staff is mildy helpful in that they bring you your food after you go to the window and pay cash for it...kind of like New Orleans Hamburger and Seafood, but dirty and with live music (which is nice). It's a one in a lifetime experience for me...just once.",
    "If you want to pay for everything a la carte this is the place for you.   Food wasn't terrible not impressive. They brought a basket of chips and some tomato sauce which I asked politely for something spicier and some pico de gallo.  She brought them happily to me and the salsa was much better.  When asked what we would like to drink I asked for a coke and she brought out a bottle which I stated I wanted the fountain drink.  She said \"oh that's only Pepsi\".  Never mentioned that they only had bottle drinks for coke.   We ordered our food which was reasonably priced, asked for sour cream and also to put cheese on the taco.  She let us know cheese was extra.   It was $2.50 extra for another basket of chips.   When I received the bill we paid more for the condiments then the actual food.  Side of sour cream 2.00, pico de gallo 2.50, salsa 2.00, chips 2.50, cheese 1.00 and the bottled coke that we didn't want 5.00.   Just a suggestion...when you order anything make sure to ask if there is an extra charge.",
    "The cafe was extremely cute. We came at 8am and they even had a jazz band playing at that time. I got the breakfast sandwich and it was delicious. I loved how they rolled the egg and put the bacon pieces inside. Great price for a filling breakfast!",
    "On a scale of one to things that are awesome, this place is the bomb.   I was drawn in by the promise of the duckfat frenchfries. Took the boy for his birthday and put our name in, had a drink around the corner while we waited and were given seats at the bar after about 45 minutes.   We were waited on by Keith, the bartender, who was congenial, knowledgeable about his whiskeys and an all-around cool guy. We started with 3 cape may salts (two for me, one for the boy) and tater tots, both of which made me happy.  For dinner, I got Kentucky Fried Quail (stellar, though the succotash was not as exciting as I wanted it to be) and the boy got the 24$ Fois Gras burger, which was incredible. Worth every penny. The duckfat fries were pretty yummy, but not even the best part of the meal. I could've done without the cheese sauce, but as it was on the side I wasn't deterred.  I look forward to coming back here, with everyone I know.",
    "We started with the artichoke dip, big mistake. It was cold and the chips were stale. Mentioned to our waitress, but nothing came of it.  We ordered a large pizza, thin crust which after adding toppings it was a bit pricey for pizza.  Pizza was ok, not great. Except for not being our advocate our server was good.  I have been here before for Cardinals game, it was better then. Will try another venue next time.",
    "It was my fiance's birthday and he decided he wanted a good, laid back Thai restaurant for dinner. Yelp steered us in the Jasmine Rice direction, and it was definitely a good decision. We wanted the summer rolls, which were on the menu, but apparently will not be available until summer, so we settled on the pan-fried dumplings. The flavor was good, but I don't think we'd order them again. We got the green curry fried rice with duck and chicken pad thai. Both of those dishes were great, but the duck stole the show. That was some the of tastiest duck I've ever had. The pad thai was a bit sweet for us, so I think we'd try a different noodle dish when we return. But it was still very good, especially with some chili sauce mixed in. Our service was good, but other people had issues. One table was rushing to get to a show at the Kimmel Center and waited quite a while for their meal (and were going to be late). Another person who got take-out was missing one of their items (but the owner realized it and called him and walked the dish to his house, which was very nice). Overall, good quality Thai! We would definitely go back.",
    "I absolutely love Courtney! She is hands down the best hairstylist I have ever had. The reason I think she is so great is that she knows what will look best on me and over the past year has understood my limits for styles. I always go into the salon and tell her to cut my hair how she thinks will look best, and I always leave blown away at what she does. You know you have a great stylist when you don't have to specify what you want done, but instead they see what needs to be done. Great stylist, great personality and very knowledgeable. I would highly recommend her to anyone who wants to look their best.",
    "I've been to this location many times when I lived in the area and although it is a chain and not exactly sexy, it does the job on many occasions.   If you need an oil change, this place is ok, if you need a state inspection this place does it.   The key is getting there when they are not busy or else you will wait.     Again, nothing fancy here a pep boys is a pep boys but all in all decent stuff.",
    "Replaced 2 old 70s lennox with 2 new ones.  They did a great job and have been runnong for 3 years now.",
    "I love the Brewpub for their variety of dishes.  Nachos, pizza and sandwiches.  Variety of beers to choose from crafted right on sight.    Every time we go, the service is slow.  I think it's just the pace of the restaurant.  It's never a quick beer and a bite of food.  Instead, enjoy the patio and friends, savor that time.    Kid and dog friendly environment.  Also great for your vegetarian and vegan friends.    My go to is a half order of the nachos or fish & chips.    Tried their Pumpkin Seasonal Beer and it's on par with some of my favorite pumpkins.",
    "Farmhouse, rustic, chic.Helpful staff with great ideas to decorate your home. Prices reasonable. Store has items from Joanna Gaines ( Fixer Upper) and much more. Finally a good home store in SB with reasonable prices.",
    "My brother came to visit and we wanted to pick up a six pack of good beers for a night in. Ended up staying and having a few while playing their Nintendo 64 (Super Smash Brothers, which the owner said was donated by fellow patrons). It's a great place with good food and genuinely nice people. Should be a staple in the Northeast.",
    "My go to menu is coconut soup and pad thai with protein. I tried same menu here.  Actually really like their coconut soup. They used enough amount of coconut milk that soup was really creamy and wasn't over powering with herb. I am so used to Americanized thai cuisine that I prefer less herb on my dish except cilantro. Pat thai was great too. Liked the amount of peanut they used, noodle was chewy and perfect and not too sweet. They gave me generous amount of chicken and white meat wasn't dry so I was very happy with my meal.",
    "Excellent service! Great diner food and breakfast is served all day. Came here for lunch- they were busy but very friendly and hospitable. Easy to get to off the 295.",
    "My go-to spot on a Saturday night! I was real bummed that lucys closed, but was pleasantly surprised by this bar just across the street! Their food is better than expected. I always get wings and fries. (be careful of the wtf sauce though) Sometimes it takes a real long time to get the bartenders attention, but the place is usually packed. And if you're lucky the always sunny crew will pop in!",
    "We were a bit weary about trying the Shellfish Company on the Wharf as more often than not, many places like these (see Cannery Row, Monterey) feast on a captive audience and provide sub-standard fare at high prices.  However, emboldened by the perennial good reviews on Yelp, we suppressed our initial observations and went ahead with the trying it out. The place is small, so definitely plan ahead. You will have to wait, so either you know, just do so, or perhaps try to visit outside of peak hours. Luckily, our wait was only about 20 minutes as the dinner rush was just leveling off.  The special was the local rock crab - $25 for 3 lbs of California Rock Crab, salad, and your choice of soup/chowder. After taking a look at a few trays of rock crab being served out, the wife and I both opted for it, as it looked awesome.    The salad/chowder combo was great as you actually received hearty portions of each, so it was a good start. As much as I liked the chowder however, the Shrimp Bisque the wife ordered was amazing, so I would recommend that going forward.   But enough of prattling on about side dishes: the rock crab tasted just as glorious as it looked. Juicy, buttery chunks of white crab meat await you, just a few cracks away. While the rock crab shells are pretty thick, once cracked, they splinter and separate easily, a good sign they are cooked to perfection. The rock crabs provided a great amount of meat for what I felt to be the least amount of work you're going to do for crab, King or otherwise.   We were thoroughly satisfied with our meal and along with the special being an overall great value, devouring the Rock Crab at SBSC turned out to be one of the favorite meals on the trip. I think ordering crab here is a safe proposition indeed.",
    "I LOVE Weaver's Way and really disagree with some of the content in previous reviews. WW is not necessarily meant for convenience shopping. I am a single woman and I find that I have no trouble shopping at the co-op, during peak times or otherwise. I actually find the co-op to be a great place to shop if you live alone because I can get smaller quantities of items than if I shop at the corporate stores like Acme. I also enjoy the work hours - I've worked throughout the store, but most recently, I have been getting in my hours by participating in the membership committee. I wouldn't say that the community is necessarily made up of \"tree huggers\" and \"earth children\", though. The community is made up of a variety of similarly-minded folks from different backgrounds. I enjoy having a place to go to where I can obtain locally grown produce, a place that offers more natural, wholesome, and preservative-free foods than chain stores with prices way below that of Whole Foods. I enjoy interacting with other members and contributing to my local and global community. I don't find the membership fee or the work hours to be prohibitive being a single person vs. a family. I don't think that membership in a co-op is for everyone and, if you aren't single, it's definitely not a solo decision. If you're keen on being committed to the Weaver Way values, you couldn't find a better place to shop. If not, stick to the chain stores or just pay the 10% visitors' fee to pop in once in a while.",
    "Honestly the food doesn't knock my socks off but other people seem to love this place. I go because my husband likes it as for me I'd rather go to a different BBQ spot. I guess it also depends on what you order.",
    "The TV shows are $4.99 and they have commercials! What a cheesy way to make money and a sign of a less than classy hotel, particularly when you pay more than $150 a night.  And there is NO complimentary breakfast, just an overpriced buffet, something even the cheapest hotels in California provide.",
    "I stopped here because it was by the hotel I was staying in. The guys working at the shop were super nice and friendly. I really like the buy one get one deal they do. I also ordered some hot wings and they were pretty good. They had a ton of sauce on them which is awesome. Next time I come back to town I will be sure to stop here for some more pizza!",
    "I've only had the cannolis here but they are awesome! They're freshly filled when ordered and the filling is phenomenal. Not too sweet, it's perfect. If you like cannoli, if you don't think you like cannoli, you should definitely get one from Termini Bros.",
    "Traveling through in our RV, stopped over in Granite City. Found this little gem of a cafe. Upon entering, the staff was very sweet and friendly. This is like home cooking. We ate here twice and all our food choices were fresh, delicious and like we would fix at home. Yum.",
    "After 3 weeks of working in the area I finally found a place off of Magazine that is not overrated. Friendly staff! Y'all know I love Phò so it's pretty damn good!",
    "Our family returned for breakfast again this weekend and the food and service was again impeccable ... Highly recommend",
    "The kayaking tour at the Santa Cruz Island was great.  My husband and I had a wonderful time.  Jen, our tour guide, was helpful and informative.  We had a lot of fun exploring the caves.  We didn't expect much but this tour definitely exceeded our expectation.",
    "Definitely recommend for anyone looking for a delicious meal at a reasonable price. The shrimp and goat cheese crepes are a must have!",
    "After living in the STL area for way over 10 years now, I am both ashamed and remorseful to admit that I ate here for the FIRST time just a few weeks ago. I am ashamed because it's a St. Louis tradition and remorseful because I missed out on it for so..many...years!   This place is amazing. What is not to love! It's a factory where you can get a tour (Friday-Sunday, noon-5pm on the hour), there's a shop, bar, and dining area. They also host many event with live music on the weekends. It's fun to just kind of wander and look around - don't worry, you'll get a chance because there will likely be a wait before you dine. The beer is, of course, amazing. The Hefeweizen is my personal favorite and a great start for anyone who is not a huge beer drinker (like myself). Additionally, the food is homegrown and damn good. I had the pizza (recommendation from my server) and it was really spectacular, though I'm admittedly a pizza connoisseur so I enjoy a good pizza pie more than most probably ;P My date had a bison burger which was also really good.   More fun info: the service is great! I think they tend to hire more funky and alternative people (like tattoo parlor staff) which I support. The quality is what makes this place stand out along with the emphasis on local food and brewery.   It is a little on the pricier side but for all the experience you get and the quality, it is worth it. I will go again and again and you probably should, too!",
    "If I could give it a zero, I would. I order a plain hamburger, and realized they put  bacon in it (which I am allergic to and unable to eat) after two bites. When I went back to the drive-through window to complain (didn't realize the actual restaurant was open--it was almost 2 after all...), the guy took back the burger, said nothing, and disappeared. After 2 minutes of awkwardly making conversation with the next people in line in their car, he came back and rudely told me I had to go inside to get my food. Which I did. And still did not get an apology.  I refuse to go back there after that ordeal, which is a shame, because it's nice to have a variety of places to go to after DT. Guess Freebirds it is!",
    "First time here and they did a great job, very satisfied with the car wash  and the service I received. Thank you",
    "I just started going to Sushi Nara this month (they opened just a short time ago).  I love this place; it is clean, the staff are friendly and acommodating, and the service is fast.  The sushi is always delicious ((I've been here 3 times) and the prices are reasonable. In fact, this week my husband stopped in for take out, bought 4 sushi rolls and the total was $24.  That is amazing.    I love the freshness of the food and there's a huge selection to choose from.  Everyone on the eastside, check this place out!",
    "Awesome little shop.  The owner really knows his stuff and you can tell he loves his work.  They have tires and other parts you won't find anywhere else.",
    "Been here so many times before and all I can say is the food is really good. A hidden gem in Florissant, it has the best Panang curry around. Haven't been to their sister restaurant yet, but I can't seem to want to move on when I am always so satisfied with their fare here.",
    "My food only merited maybe two stars but I will give an extra star because I like the menu (and will try more of it) and their design and concept.  Sadly though, my tomato-basil soup tasted kind of like a weak marinara and my tuna melt type sandwich had a very sharp, off-putting flavor.  It was citrusy, for sure, and I love lemon in a tuna melt but perhaps this was lemon zest or something just way too overpowering?  I think next time I will focus on the dishes with cured Italian meats, mortadella and prosciutto.  And also the baked goods, those sounded pretty good, especially the Nutella bruschetta!",
    "We visited once and were very disappointed in my veggie pizza and my husband's sub sandwich.  The tomato sauce was not tasty, and they did not use enough cheese on my pizza.  The dough looked and tasted like it was prepared by a machine.  Perhaps they have improved, but we are not in any rush to try a second time.",
    "A couple friends and I stopped by for some late night milkshakes and found ourselves at More Than Just Ice Cream. Well, we just got ice cream...not fully taking advantage of what the name implies, but maybe next time.  3 milkshakes: 1 coffee, 1 chocolate, and 1 black&white malt.   All were pretty good. Definitely satisfied the ice cream craving. I thought my coffee milkshake could have been thicker, same goes for the chocolate. The black&white was plenty thick and was probably the best of the three. Unfortunately, I did not order that one so I settled for my not so creamy coffee.  I did sample some ice cream flavors before setting on a milkshake. I tried the pumpkin pie which was AMAZING. I don't know why I didn't just get this. Maybe a milkshake isn't the way to go here.",
    "My husband and I took my mother here for her 100th birthday! We can't say enough about the treatment we received: from a great table and view, to delicious \"compliments of the chef\" extra dishes, to a beautifully decorated cake plate, to the warm and attentive servers. It was much more than we expected, even for this very special occasion. For us, it was a wonderfully memorable experience.",
    "Man. This place is nice. The bartender was awesome. Try the burger. It's fresh with all local ingredients. The plates of food I saw come out looked amazing as well.   The beer is cold. The drinks are mixed perfectly.  This is not a chain restaurant but a dedicated local place with good employees.",
    "I visited this restaurant 4 times during my 5 days stay. Crazy, right? Here are a list of reasons/pros:  - We were staying a nearby hotel. - The restaurant opens 11 - 10:30 pretty much every day including new year's day so it fits into our schedule. - If you are a party of two, chances are you get seated right away. - $9 per dozen of oysters which is a really great deal by any standard! - They have a seafood shop next door that sells boiled and fresh seafood to- go. - Our server (same) is very friendly and recognized us every single time.  Now I want to talk about the reasons why I only give it 3 stars.  - We tried a bunch of stuff which are all pretty mediocre. Raw oysters are not cleaned well. So if your schedule is flexible, go to Superior Seafood during their happy hours for their 50 cents/oyster - better quality and cheaper. Turtle soup has a strange taste so I definitely prefer Felix's. A portion of my boiled shrimps are always mushy somhow, maybe boiled for too long?... - The ambient is inviting but not comfortable so we basically just finished our food and go.  - Clean the bathroom!!  Will probably visit again if we stay in the area next time or simply just pick up some seafood quickly.",
    "Skip this train wreck if you are looking for dinner.  Our server was clueless...like we seriously thought she was lost in the restaurant.  Had to ask for setups, water refills, etc.  Ordered chicken parmesan and got eggplant parmesan instead with a fish bone in it.  The drinks were good.",
    "Meh is all I can say for TDS. The restaurant itself is just cold.... not literally, but figuratively. There was no decor, no menu boards, stainless steel prep tables as dining tables, no soda machines, staff EVERYWHERE with no identification (shirts, nametags, etc). The food is reasonably priced and most of it was quite good, but what really irked my party was the fact that they charge for extra salsa!!! We ordered a salsa trio (which included 3 samples of the various salsas, in 2oz glass prep bowls), and when my brother asked for more salsa for his tacos (mind you, we ordered one of ever taco, three burritos and guacamole), he was told he'd have to buy the trio again! Really!!??? We spent over $40 on food, drinks and apps, too. Even though the food was decent, I wouldn't return as the atmosphere is just blah and you can't get extra salsa for your damn tacos!",
    "I'm so incredibly happy with our pictures! Angela Clifton Photography have worked with us 3 times and we have been happy with every single picture that was taken! Not only are the photos fabulous, but we had such a fun experience. The price is extremely reasonable and the pictures will be a keepsake we will cherish forever!",
    "Enjoyed my fish out at a sidewalk table.  A bit pricey but food was good.  Go to Side street in French quarter if u want quieter dining outside.",
    "The court house is very old and the art is great. The spiral staircase is funny. One can get view of entire city from 5th level. The tower clock room is really surprising with all mechanical gears inside!! You need a prior appointment to get into clock room. Worth spending 2 to 3 hours of time here.",
    "I had the pleasure to meet with Ann today and not only was she extremely helpful and so positive, she went above and beyond to make my 1st experience here amazing and made it a absolute regular customer from this day forward. Thanks girlie!!",
    "This is the first time I tried this place and  I was surprisingly surprised. I had a combination dinner pad Thai and coconut soup. The soup was very tasty as I never had coconut soup before. The pad Thai was exactly what I was expecting and it did not disappoint. The restaurant had great Thai decor and music. The staff and service was top notch. For a town with not much selection for food, this was a great change of pace. This may become my go to place in Carp.",
    "This place was so chill and relaxing. When I come back it'll definitely be in my list if stops. Not to mention the artist performing was fun and eclectic  (I mean really, a country version of \"Let It Go\", what's not to love?)",
    "Id you haven't been to the Smoothie King center since it was know as the New Orleans Arena, you are in for a nice surprise. The arena has had a face lift and, while the seats are the same,  everything else has been refreshed.     Most importantly,  the food options are far more varied and appeal to many tastes.  The quality of the food is very good and significantly improved from a few years back. The drink options are much improved as well and include full service bars, spiked lemonade,  bottled and draft beer and of course, smoothies.  There is even a spot for sweets. You can get funnel cake, cotton candy, and all kinds of delicious things I was too full to take in.    The venue finally feels a bit swanky and top notch.  We are moving on up!",
    "Don't know what it is but If my tummy's feeling icky, I can count on Chipotle's stake to fix me up. I just have to remember not to go during full on lunch time. I usually go between 2 & 4 when it's peaceful and calm. Busy or not the service is always friendly and fast!",
    "I must admit, I wasn't expecting much. This place totally blew us away. This has to be one of the best Indian restaurants in the Tampa Bay. The ambience is wonderful including white table linens. The best part was the food, OMG. The chicken 65 was to die for, and the hot sour soup was rich and flavorful. The waitress (Angel) was friendly,  attentive and very pleasant. They opened just a week ago. I'm sure this will soon be the place foodies seek out for real Indian food.",
    "Had to wait until my third trip to NOLA to actually get in the door.  First two times I tried waiting in line, this time around we got smart and bought reserved seats so we could be on the benches. Well worth the extra $20 to not hassle with waiting in line for an hour. It goes toward the preservation of Jazz so it's a good cause...just splurge.  The show was fantastic.  True musicians and great personalities to boot. I can only imagine that this is what concerts were like 50 years ago. The band members were dapper, engaging and insanely talented.  It's in a tiny hole in the wall space that only holds maybe 200 people? So it's very intimate and nice to see the smiles on the faces of the musicians as they share their craft with you. This is a must do while in NOLA!",
    "A GREAT EXPERIENCE!!!!!!!!!  I was a completely new customer.  I did not have an appointment because my other plans got rained out and my dealership was too busy to take me.  I needed a PA State & Emissions  inspection which I dread because they can be a total ripoff at some places when they add things on and I just wanted to get it over with.  I saw that this place had much better reviews on Yelp than many other shops in the area.  Keystone Discount Tire took my 2008 Pontiac Torrent in for inspection while I waited and had some free coffee.  I only had to get up once to look at some irregular outer front tire wear on my car when it was on the rack during inspection.  I always appreciate it when the technician lets me look at the problem.   It was nothing major.  Easily correctable with an alignment sometime in the future.  Bill was very friendly, knowledgable, and straightforward with his overall analysis of my car.  My car was fully inspected and stickered in less than an hour without my bill being jacked up with add-ons.   I recommend getting on their mailing list for their coupons!!!!!!!!!!",
    "Wow! I never thought my sons phone could be repaired after he dropped it but it is and it took less than a half an hour! Very professional and excellent service! I'm thrilled!",
    "Service and management terrible... After messing up all 4 of our orders the waiter got mad and started cursing... The manager offered our drinks to be free.. What a mess. The food was cold and nasty didn't even eat half of it and waited over an hour... I will never dine in any cracker barrel again after this experience...",
    "I have been to a number of dog friendly hotels...just not in the city and did not know what to expect. Usually they are motel like.  This one was in the heart of the city.  I walked tentatively into the hotel lobby as i have a labrador/golden mix who is not easy to hide.  We got to the front desk to register and i was still feeling uneasy although my  bf had assured me it was a dog friendly hotel. Reception was so nice immediately putting us at ease. As we checked in an attendant asked if Bentley could have treats which she fullly enjoyed. The Reception person also asked if we would like a welcome kit for Bentley. Holy moly. Of course. Dog dishes, a mat, treats, etc. I was blown away.    Plus the guests at the hotel all stopped to compliment and pet \"queen Bentley\". Our room was on the top floor. Awesome!  Even when i went to walk her the car attendants greeted her by name. We were so impressed with the service we decided to come back an extra night.   Thank you Loews. I didnt realize a hotel could be so dog friendly especially to a big dog.",
    "Sometimes this food is very very good.  Unfortunately it's not consistent.   Ordered something I've been getting for years and every other time it tastes incredible. It's like they have different people in the kitchen and you don't know who you will get. So 50 % of the time it's excellent.  UGH.",
    "Been to this location twice and will never go back again!!!!  First time was mediocre, the second time was so very disappointing it beggars belief. I ordered some ribs and had to send them back because one half was warm and the other half was refrigerator cold. They came back and one side was really hot and the other side was still cold, third time it was edible. The manager came over the third time to apologize, never once offered to comp anything. I'm not the kind of guy to cause a fuss to get something comped, but to send something back three times to get it cooked properly and only get an insincere apology really pisses me off, enough for me to write this review.",
    "After trying a few ramen places with crazy variety in their selections and stellar broth, I was not too excited about the ramen I got at Cheu.  Maybe it's a matter of taste, but personally, I was not a fan of their thick noodles, and extremely salty broth.    The service was great, and they had a nice selection of beers!  The friend I went with loved it, and has been many times.  Honestly, I'm just sorry I wasn't a bigger fan.  But I hope others try it for themselves.  I might just be an oddball out on this one.",
    "Federal Doughnuts is a new concession at the ballpark -- who doesn't love some doughnuts and fried chicken?    Also, there is now a concession stand near 136 that is gluten-free dedicated.  They offer pizza, cheesesteaks and even brownies and cookies.",
    "Looks like there is a second Red Kings restaurant in Chinatown and it did not disappoint! Since this place just opened yesterday, I'm not exactly sure if it's replacing the other Red Kings down the street, or if it is just a second helping of spicy, Szechuan food.  We ordered takeout and picked up the Dan Dan Noodles and a shredded Pork in Garlic sauce dish. The spice level in both dishes was perfect.  Extremely mouth-burning, but with delicious flavors that were sweet, earthy, and fresh. The portions were very generous and will make for great leftovers for us. I can't wait to try some of the other dishes and come back here for a sit-down dinner. They also have karaoke rooms upstairs, plus they are BYOB.",
    "This is one of the busiest Chick fil A's I've seen but they always manage to be quick and have exceptional service! I seriously don't know how they can be so quick and great all the time! One of my favorite places!",
    "Best place for salads! I go there every time I'm in town for lunch. It's fast and veggies are always fresh.",
    "My parents and I took the Oak Alley and Laura Plantation tour on September 26th, 2015.  I forgot the name of our driver-he was very informative on our drive to the plantations.  The schedule is perfect!  We were dropped off where we had time before and after the tour for free time to walk around the properties.  They are very flexible with drop off locations on the return drive.  We got off near Jackson Square and got to enjoy the rest of the afternoon in the French Quarter.",
    "We have been here twice for brunch and have enjoyed it immensely. Everything we have tried has been delicious, particularly the grits with scallions and sour cream. But the room is always freezing so be sure to bring a sweater!",
    "Love this place...best hot dogs and chili dogs around...i go here as many times as i can..yum",
    "Sweet spot in the Waterline. Came for some live music with friends on Saturday. Very cool. Best local beer in town by far. Seems like the concept is a few notches up from Fig Mountain. Definitely prefer Topa. Even cooler is that you can order incredible food from the Nook Restaurant, and walk two feet into Lama Dog which is part of the Waterline. I love it!!",
    "Great customer service! We were a little out of their pick up area but they were very accommodating and came and got our group of 7. When we got there we realized we were billed for 8 instead of 7. I called and he refunded my money for the extra ticket in minutes!  The tour itself was SO much fun! We were laughing and smiling and our tour guide was funny! We saw lots of alligators! From babies swimming in the water to full grown ones! We saw turtles and birds too! Our tour guide had a baby alligator we could hold that he's raising until it's a little bigger since it was a late hatch that would have died because of when it was born. The ride back was fun too because we went fast and the guide did some \"tricks\" with the boat! I highly recommend this tour!!!",
    "Westfall replaced our roof in April. We could not be more pleased with the entire process. Quality roof, excellent communication and excellent follow up. Very happy we chose this company to replace our roof.",
    "Good food, reasonably priced, and nice staff. Not ideal for eating in, but since they are going for a fast food approach to vegan food, that makes a lot of sense. I know the buffalo bella is the dish that they push the hardest, but for my money the Cheesesteak is the way to go. And pro-tip: Get the sweet potato fries.",
    "The ramen is okay, nothing spectacular. Service is okay. Good place for a quick stop but wouldn't go if there were other choices. Been here twice, will continue to go.",
    "A menu that satisfies everyone's cravings! Clean, trendy, and delicious! I definitely recommend going early (before 9 am) as the wait tends to get longer after 9 am! But honestly, it is soooo worth the wait. You will leave there feeling so incredible satisfied!",
    "Had the brisket sandwich with two sides and a drink for 9.99 - Great barbecue at an affordable price. Wonderful side such as potato casserole cream spinach baked beans green beans",
    "The food and service was amazing! I only wish they had any vegetarian/vegan options. Can't wait to come back!",
    "Great food. Terrible customer service. I've been three times and I've had two different older waitresses. Not pleasant to deal with whatsoever. The owner on the other hand is lovely.",
    "I first heard about this place on the plane ride over from a Franklin local.  He recommended that we brave the line and try one of Nashvilles best breakfast spots.  HE WAS RIGHT.  Holly cow this place kicked butt and we didn't even have to wait in line!! We were lucky to miss the rush said our waitress.   I had this super savory corn pancake with bacon, salsa, and sour cream. So good. This place will always be a stop when I get back to the south~~~",
    "OMG!!! I can't believe this kind of service exists!  My husband called to make an appointment for full detailing for next Sat with Michael, he called again to confirm on Fri before we head there since it's a distance from our home.  Michael said he didn't know we wanted to do full detailing thou we specifically mentioned that.  He advised us to come the following sat instead.  We agreed and we reached there at 8am on the following week.  Guess what?  Nobody is at the workshop, it's closed!  We called him and he said he is busy and will call back.. We waited for half an hour in our car and there is still no call from him.  We headed for our breakfast and came back again at 9:30am hoping to give him another chance.  Here comes Alex, his partner opening the shop at 9:30am!  1.5 hours away from our appt time and still no sight of Michael.  Alex tried calling Michael and couldn't get hold of him.  We gave up!!! What a horrendous experience!",
    "I had numerous things happen during my move and required additional services from this office. The guys in this office are top notch and are very trustworthy. I'd say more about how they took great care of me, but they may have gone above and beyond what they should have and afraid to say too much. I would recommend this office to my mother!",
    "We stayed at The Saint last year for a girl's trip. The lobby is lovely, they have a cool bar and restaurant that you can't help but to \"ohh and ahh\" over when you walk in.  All the things I'm accustomed too when I stay at a hotel anywhere...ambiance, a little sexy but not overkill! Everyone is so friendly, etc.  I'm thinking \"oh shhhh this is going to be a great weekend!\"  I checked in a few hours before my girl arrived because I had a ton of work i needed to do. So I set up my laptop ordered some room service and worked for about 4 hours straight. Left out to buy a bottle and get a mani/pedi.  My girl arrives...its about to be some trouble in NOLA... the two of us and no supervision...we pop out for dinner, come back in giggling as usual and we see it...a HUGH flying roach.  I'm freaked out.  I literally walk right out of the room down to the front desk.  I CANNOT!!!! They tell me they're sending a maintenance worker to handle it.  NOT GOOD ENOUGH! If there's one that's bold enough to show itself, he has other cohorts that prefer to live behind the scenes. They give us another room but tell me they can't do more until 8am.  No the room the move us too also has small spiders and other dead small bugs in the corners of the window. The TV doesn't work and one of the lamps doesn't have bulbs in it! COME ON!  At this point its about 3am and I know I'm not staying here past 8:15am. I dont want to sit my purse let alone my luggage in this hotel! I go online to my normal go to hotel, The W and book us there for the rest of the trip! 8am comes and goes no manager comes to our room. I go down and demand to see someone immediately.  This younger gentlemen comes out and apologizes.  I thank him for his apology and politely request ALL of my money back immediately.   He obliged and asked if  I would consider coming back after changes have been made! Bless his heart. NO dear!",
    "Say you decide that you need a new door...and you only have $35.  Where do you go?  the Green Project.   Or you have a bunch of left over building supplies, random bits of lumber, some roofing materials, maybe even some paint?  Where can you bring it so it doesn't end up in a landfill?  Again, the Green Project.",
    "Worst place I've ever visited. The bouncer was rude and he didn't have to be. This place thinks just cause your on broadway you can treat people bad and over charge.   I'm not a tourist I live here and will never visit or recommend",
    "Stopped in for the lunch menu with my girlfriend, place was extremely clean, food was ON POINT!  And AFFORDABLE Can't wait to go back!!",
    "So disappointing on so many levels. Have been coming here for years - and the quality of food has fallen off a cliff. Strike one - we shared an artichoke to start - and clearly it had been prepared beforehand (eg, cold on the inside - but the flesh was cooked through)  Strike two - my wife had a Greek salad - and it clearly all came from a bag and was extremely overdressed with tasteless dressing.  Strike three - I had grilled yellowtail which was basically execrable - could not even finish it (overcooked and an inferior-frozen piece of fish - unacceptable for SB).   In short - great setting, good service - but with such horrible food - not worth the visit. This place really needs to up the quality of food - or it's going to end up just another lower State dive for the tourists.",
    "Milktooth is the place to go if you want a good breakfast cocktail and a twist on traditional brunch. At first glance of the menu, you may think you've never heard of any of these foods for breakfast, and you may be right. I guarantee no matter what you order, you're going to enjoy it.   Milktooth is one of the most popular brunch places in Indy, which means you will typically have a wait. Trust me, it's worth the usual 30 minute wait (on weekends). To make it go by a little faster, they've got a walk up bar for their coffee drinks and pastries. Snack on one of those to give you a preview of the amazing meal you're about to have.  Their menu changes from time to time but they have a few things that stay one the menu but change ingredients. I love all of their variations on a Dutch pancake, and their raclette grilled cheese is to die for.  If you're making this a boozy breakfast, don't pass up on the michelada. And sit outside if it's warm enough!",
    "The bar and staff are AMAZING. we got a room upgrade for have been being on our honeymoon and the view was gorgeous. But, the room was not any better than a hilton. It had rust in the tub floor, and some weird stains on the tile. But this was only in the bathroom, so i give it 4 stars! Great staff, but too much for valet so we parked a couple streets down. That was the only other con I would say.   Would recommend if you want to be literally in the working downtown area of st. louis. Lots of cool bars and restaurants on a friday night.",
    "I took the beginning class there, and I loved it. It was perfectly paced, and though the moves weren't difficult, they really stretched me in places I didn't know existed! I even broke a small sweat! But I felt great afterwards! The studio is clean, and I like that I can buy some Beyond Organic food items there too.",
    "Not sure why it took until now for us to find this place. We started out going to the chain lobster restaurant but wanted something more authentic. A friend recommended Lobster Haven and I checked it out online. Looked like a type of place we would eat at in Massachusetts when we visit family. We were not disappointed! Service was great, fast and very friendly. Huge selection of all of the favorites. You have to visit this place if you want authentic New England seafood. You can also purchase live lobster and fresh seafood to go and cook it yourself.",
    "Fabulous! Best happy hour, fresh menu, Delish- drinks, if I had the time, I'd come here every day!",
    "Men's clubs is the tits, plain and simple. All the barbers got skills enough to hook it up fresh. Been coming here for 3 years and I've never had any problems. Except for maybe that one time when this dude tried to steal my cut. Tim kept it real though and said \"I can't give you the same cut as Ryan.\" Thanks Tim.",
    "My husband and I come here often. We love the food here, it's always fresh and the service is great. We highly recommend this place to anyone who loves sushi & hibachi.",
    "Oh Chickie's and Pete's, you are the perfect place to watch some sports and indulge.   No doubt this is not the best food I've ever had but, if you can get a seat, grab some beer with mussels red and crab fries, there's no way not to thoroughly enjoy this place during a game or any time you're down by the stadiums.   My favs are the crab fries, mussels red (white is overloaded with garlic that I can't always take it), the spicy pull and peel shrimp, steamers, and if the mood is right the blue crabs (it's a lot of work but tasty). This place also makes getting down and dirty with your food easy. There are sinks all over so you can rinse the mess off your hands once you're done....good touch.  To sum it up, Chickie's and Pete's is a Philadelphia institution and always a good time. I strongly suggest going at least once to enjoy the experience.   Please note: Make sure to remember two things before coming during major sporting events. 1. You'll never get a table and 2. You'll deal with a ton of drunk people. I've absolutely been one of these people before and we can get annoying unless you're in the right frame of mind. :)",
    "Prompt and professional. On a Saturday. Simple mirror fix, but they made it easy for me. I have used them in Charlotte and they were great then, too.",
    "Good choice in Union Station St. Louis.  I had the Ponchartrain (server said it is same as Tilapia, though that was also on the menu, so why two names for the same fish, I have no clue).  The Ponchartrain was quite good with mushrooms and a cream sauce.  We also had the shrimp cocktail and lump crab cake appetizers....both fine, but not wonderful.  Drinks and service were perfectly acceptable.  We dined outside on the patio since the weather was nice - inside looks comfy and a bit less casual.",
    "I stopped in for a drink yesterday and have to say the atmosphere gets an A+ from me.  Such a unique concept for the St. Pete area.  The attention to detail with the remodel was outstanding, it almost feels like you are in a Harry Potter movie or something.  There is background music that is set at a low volume so you can clearly hear your friends or not have to shout for them to hear you - perfect for the old library-esque environment. Working behind the bar were Michael and Peggy - both couldn't have been more friendly and were overall just interesting people to talk to.   I had eaten dinner already before I came so can't speak on the food but will definitely be back to try - the prices for meat/cheese trays are much better than comparable places in the area.  I would definitely recommend checking this place out...",
    "Yes! I love this place! Maple Street Patisserie is the bomb.com! I've never been disappointed. Best blueberry muffin I've ever had in my whole entire life. Delicious breakfast and lunch spot. They also do specialty cakes so swing by during Mardi Gras and grab a king cake. Also the owner, Ziggy, is the man. He's always running around working crazy hours to make all these scrumptious baked goods. Can't beat this place :)",
    "Really good burger. I had the Bourbon Black and Bleu. It was cooked like I wanted and very tasty.   I gave them 3 stars for the wait. We had a big party - 4 adults and 5 kids - and it took over an hour to get our food. Shouldn't have taken that long, regardless of how many people were at our table.",
    "It seems to me that whenever we have out of towner guests, our go to place is consistently Katie's. The variety of food wonderfully prepared is 2nd to none. Reasonably priced and delicious, Katie's never disappoints. Whether you choose the grilled ersters, the shrimp and grits, the Cuban sandwich, pizza, or soup & salad you will be very pleased and have a great meal. Daily specials hi-lite local seasonal offerings that keep things fresh. The service staff are warm and friendly. On Sunday's, you will want to time your arrival before church let's out or you will have a bit of a wait. That said, you can always manage while enjoying bottomless Mimosas!",
    "Came in after attending the Zurich Classic golf tournament. It was a warm and a bit humid so what tastier then a ice cream cone? I lucked out and found a parking space on the street. The interior is quite cute and comfy.  The selection here is crazy huge but after sampling a couple of unusual flavors I went with the scoop of cookie monster ice cream on a cone. The ice cream hit the spot and I enjoyed it BC it wasn't overly sweet.  Creole Creamery was definitely worth checking out!",
    "I LOVE this place!  I have been coming here for a few years now.  Its a little funky, and I would never order say the escargot, for safety reasons, but when it comes to lots of Saki, great rolls, and mountains of rice and Sashimi, this is the way to go.  Young atmosphere, loud dance music, and SAKI!",
    "We absolutely love everything we have tried here. Our favorite thus far has been the Backyard Bowl, although there are several more that we still need to try. My husband and I are always full after we each get a kids size, or split a large. The ingredients are good quality,  filling foods. For the quality of ingredients, the price is very reasonable. It can get pretty busy here, but have patience, it is worth the wait.",
    "It's was okay service was a bit on the interesting side as the person was new. Food presentation was good though they need to either add rice or more potato salad to the gumbo. Sprite was flat but I didn't need it anyways.",
    "This is a pretty good pancake place, but it's a little disorganized in the way it's run when it's really busy. The pancakes are pretty good but super sweet, so you have to be in there. Good price point. Serves breakfast all day so that's definitely a plus, but not anything particularly special that you couldn't get anywhere else.",
    "Great finds and wonderful staff!  LOVE our finds and will definitely be back!!!",
    "We've been coming here since I was a kid. The staff has watched me and now my kids grow up. They're personable and so nice. They're also very prompt with service. Yoli and frank are the absolute best! The food is amazing! I absolutely love their shredded beef burro and cheese crisp. I feel they have true authentic Mexican food.",
    "Dine-in gets 2 stars. Disappointing service & venue falls short.   The food was ok; so if you were to do take out, maybe this place would get 3 stars.   I ordered the lamb kebab, which tasted ok; but it was very plain. No sauces, lettuce or anything - just meat.",
    "The best middle eastern restaurant in this area!! Food is great and consistent!! Makes my tummy happy!!!",
    "I cannot even believe someone gave this place one star. Here's the scoop. They have the BEST cannoli in the city. Termini's are no where NEAR as good, and Isgro's is far too hyped up for the quality. Potito's is my go to for cannoli, i wouldn't even THINK about going anywhere else. I'm there every xmas eve, and will be for the rest of my days. I stood in line for isgros for TWO HOURS this year for a tirimisu, i walked right into potito's and picked up my bambino cannoli stuffed cannoli. it's as good as it sounds, trust me.",
    "Truly, I cannot say enough good things about this tiny, authentic, perfectly delicious eatery!  Growing up in the panhandle of Texas, we had plenty of authentic Mexican food in our home, and I'm always searching for good Mexican restaurants. El Limon is the best I've ever had in the state of Pennsylvania!  Sopes, tostadas, enchiladas, fajitas, burritos, fish tacos....all excellent and sooooo reasonable!  Waitstaff is always pleasant and attentive.  Best two features: homemade tamales and free margaritas!!  Bring the entire family for an amazing Mexican feast!  Ole!",
    "I'm giving this joint 4 stars because they have earned it, but they are definitely 5 star material, if they work out a few kinks. Granted, they just opened, so some of the errors I've experienced (I work in the area, so I've been there several times) will probably get worked out and they are more than willing to make corrections and accommodations when they mess up.   But over all, the food is REALLY good. Unlike my fellow Yelp-ers, I would say that ther pizza is not their strong suit - its kinds greasy and not sure if they use 100% mozzarella - tastes like its cut with something cheaper. However, so far I've had:    The Quaker (Chicken version) - Delicious. They make their chicken steaks with the chunky chicken, which I like much more than the shredded version. They could season the chicken more, but the cheese was melted perfectly and the veggies were fresh.   The fries - crisp and flavorful. I didn't even need ketchup, and I always eat ketchup on my fries  The onion rings - a little greasy, but very tasty and crisp. The onions stayed in the breading and didn't slide out when you bit them (which I hate).   Spanakopita - mine was a little over cooked, but the flavors were really good  Baklava - VERY GOOD!   Signature Salad - The veggies they use are very fresh which will make or break a salad. Their balsamic is great too!  The (turkey) Greek Burger - one of the best turkey burgers I've ever had! The patty was moist and flavorful all on its own, but then they top it with what must be homemade tzatziki. I could eat a bowl of that stuff! My burger had romaine instead of the advertised arugula, but it was very fresh, so I didn't mind as much. I also asked for feta, which I didn't get, but that sauce made me forget all about it.   Overall, this place is great! Provided they don't stray from the high quality standard they are setting, I will keep going back.",
    "Planet fitness gets four stars just because it is open 24 hours. If you are looking at cheapest it's cheapest best bang for your buck . Not much motivation since bodybuilders don't go there much mostly big women . No pun intended . No discrimination I myself used to be big, although I changed that .  Tanning bed and massage chairs and a sculpt machine and everything. Else for 20.00 a month . 9.99 - the massage and stuff and can't bring friends . All the employees are polite and helpful .",
    "Very disappointed. We went to eat  at 2:15 on Saturday and were told the kitchen closed at 2. Their website says: Sat & Sun all day. Their website claims that they are open until 5. I'm always a bit suspect of places that can't manage simple details like their hours on their website. It makes me wonder about the awareness to quality and other \"small\" items.",
    "These guys do good work, on time, and warranty their work.  I would highly recommend them!",
    "Eat here at least 2 times a week. Servers are always friendly and the food is amazing. I never leave disappointed & always leave with a full stomach",
    "A truly delightful find! This is the transformed Carrow's Restaurant on Plumb and Kietzke that was saved by the wrecking ball by its beautiful redwood beams and fascia. The food was fantastic. My wife had the tri-tip salad -- greens on one side of the plate with a balsamic vinagrette balanced by four good-sized slices of medium-rare tri-tip and potato \"croutons\" -- little heavenly bits of crunchy potatoes. I had the tri/tip/chicken combo, selecting the fresh corn salad and potato salad as my two sides. It was so good that we ordered dessert as well (not something I do regularly). The offering was lemon meringue, mudd pie, apple pie, and ice cream. We shared the first -- again delicious, with real, perfectly set and browned meringue. The prices were very reasonable for the quality of food and the experience. We've already recommended to family and friends locally, and expect to return soon. Well done!",
    "Rebecca didn't Doula my birth.  BUT, she was our nanny to our first born daughter.  Over the months of her being in my home, I realized that I looked forward to talking to her before & after work.  I was big & pregnant with Baby #2, and her information & suggestions hit home with this expectant Momma!  She was always easy to talk with, yet honest and extremely truthful!  (A trait I LOVE!!!).  She loves the special role she plays as Doula to laboring woman!!  She finds beauty and strength in that magical time. Bec would be a great addition to your support team!!!",
    "Recently had my car tinted by Orange Tint and Tune and had fantastic service.  They offer a car pick up service if you live within 4 miles of their shop which is extremely convenient.  Carlos was my technician and went over all the tint options with me and even adjusted the grade of the tint after I expressed the look that I was trying to achieve.  That's the kind of customer care that deserves 5 stars.  In addition, the receptionist was very pleasant and the owner Dustin even followed up to see how my service was.",
    "Stayed here three nights on business.  The property is located very close to the airport but you really don't hear it.  The rooms are standard TownePlace Suite rooms with a refrigerator, stove, etc..  The area in which the hotel is located is quiet with a combination of other hotels and office buildings.  It's about a 20 minute drive to the downtown or university area.  About 5-10 minutes from Pima Air Museum.  There are not too many restaurants close by but there are some fast food options and a sandwich place called Baggins that was really good and within walking distance.  The staff of the hotel was really friendly and helpful.  The breakfast is standard continental with a couple of hot options. They also have a reception on weekday evenings.  My only complaint is that the food and drink go quickly so get there early.  You could use this as a dinner if you wanted.  I got there about 45 minutes after it started and although there was food left there were very few soft drinks left (no diet).  They could improve by keeping the area stocked throughout the period.  Anyway, the rooms are nice, beds are comfortable and area is safe.",
    "We got diverted to Tampa and decided to make the drive to Orlando but first we needed somewhere to eat. Wanting to avoid chain restaurants, yelp steered us towards this little local gem!  The ladies had the 7 oz. Tampa strip and the gents both had a 14 oz. ribeye. They grill their steaks over oak and citrus Wood and the smoky flavor is to die for! We are big fans of our smoker back home and cook our steaks this way as well, it's rare to find steak cooked over woodsmoke in most places and this was worth the side trip!  Sides were veggies and sweet potatoes. The wines on offer were so reasonably priced- most under $20 a bottle but a decent selection. They just don't mark them up 5x like most places!   Our waitress Lisa also made great recommendations and her service was welcoming, friendly, and excellent. We are so glad we went local instead of to a chain. Bookmarking this place for a return trip next time I am in Tampa for sure!",
    "The owner of this location (and two others including Southampton) reached out to me after my previous review. We ended up talking for half an hour and I was very impressed with his approach to business... he's definitely the type of person I want to do business with. I returned to Saladworks on two separate occasions and the service had vastly improved. The new summer salads are wonderful!",
    "By far the best deli I have ever been to in the US. YEP, the US. Lots of crazy choices and oh it is hard to pick!! The Muffalata is so big 4 people can share. It is so tasty and amazing! Go on Saturday or Thursday night when they have live music! The special is always a good pick and don't worry there are plenty of sides to choose from. Great Chili, potato salad and of course chips. GO NOW...",
    "My dad and I are on a cross country trip and one of our first stops was Saguaro National Park.  We did a quick tour with Park Ranger Carolyn and loved it. She was incredibly enthusiastic and passionate about her studies on the saguaro and she was very knowledgeable. Definitely recommend both the tour and Carolyn.",
    "Came here after my husband bought home their lemon pepper wings. They have plenty of flavors. Ranging from ones you've heard of (lemon pepper, mild) to New Orleans flavors (yaka mein, noonie bird). They also have their drinks. The watermelon is to die for. I don't know what they put in it but lord help them. The location isn't the best but they're trying to put something back in the community. It's in the same section with the daiquiri shop so it's really not that bad during the day. I probably wouldn't come at night by myself. Definitely give this place a try. Hey you might even see Skip.",
    "Back to Tom Jones and time to update my review. I didn't see that odd ATM type machine that only lets you withdraw money to apply to your check. It's no longer there-used to be next to restrooms. There is still a payphone back there which I love. There are now ATM's at front entrance.   The blue ribbon is now $3.79, but still a bargain since it includes everything: pancakes, 2 eggs, toast, sausage, bacon,juice & coffee. I ate here with my kids. My daughter's choice. Says she \"loves Tom Jones\". Our meals included blue ribbons, french toast, chicken, club sandwich & baked potato . Everyone gets what they like.     I don't smell stale smoke and would not call it dirty.  I like the \"loud\" orange booths. I feel like I went back in time with these and the payphone. Service is always fast and I always seem to get a different waitress. Don't know where they find these young ladies but they're good. I've seen different managers there and they are all quick and on top of things-which makes a good manager.    Since it's my daughter's fave I'm bumping it up from 4 to 5 stars.",
    "I am an amateur athlete. I first met Dr. Ferrel when I was playing softball. He was watching my game when I was severely injured.  He treated me on the field by relocating my ankle and then told me to come to his office for treatment. I told him I could not afford that as a single mom on a teacher's salary. Instead, I saw a physician. He said it would be months before I would play again. Depressed and without much hope, I reached out to Dr. Ferrel again. He did treat me as he promised. Not only did he treat me, he healed me within weeks instead of months. Over the years Dr. Ferrel has worked on me with amazing results each time. He will always be my hero...",
    "Always fun to go to their shows.  Entertaining and relaxed atmosphere. For a good time and good food at a fair price this is the place to go.",
    "Love in n out. There's just a mood for in n out that you have to fulfill sometimes.  What can I say. 4 patties animal style bruh",
    "Cindy is the best! Great food and service. Food is authentic and so is the staff. Everything is made fresh and you can taste the difference from other Mexican restaurants at first bite. I would recommend to anyone that enjoys Mexican cuisine.",
    "I've been wanting to try Trust Me BBQ for over a year now.  I stopped in there about 3 months ago and waited in line for 10 minutes with no service and left.  After reading reviews, I figured I'd give it a chance again just to see what all the fuss is about.  The food was 50/50 but the service was horrible so I'll likely never return.  The gentleman behind the counter didn't speak, smile or engage with us at all, I felt like I was at a vending machine.  Once we finally ordered, he didn't even listen to the order and put the wrong sides in our meals, we had to correct him while he was serving.  All in all, I will just stick with Down to the Bone BBQ  Pros:  BBQ Sauce is delicious, macaroni salad was different and interesting, \"pulled\" pork was moist.  Cons:  Chicken was more dry than a sheet of paper, inedible even with the BBQ Sauce.  Mac & Cheese was served from a pan that has probably been on the steam table for 2-3 days.  Collard Greens were very mildly flavored.",
    "Was in town for a week and came by this little hole in the wall.  The pa nang chicken was excellent.  I ordered one star spicy and it came quick.  Will definitely return.",
    "Cinco de mayo means margaritas and sangria and all things fried... this great place does a nice job with combining flavors of several different ethnicities and backgrounds and develops recipes that are unique.  Although not touted as a \"Mexican\" destination they know how to rock the rock salt and pour that tequila.  They also just opened a wine bar a couple doors down for overflow and specialty bottles.  A high five for the on the rocks margaritas and house made white or red sangria - definitely worth the trip!",
    "This small little donut bakery is located in one of Hermitage's oldest shopping centers!   I can imagine baking donuts is a hard job, let alone running the business...it's one of those jobs that starts in the wee hours of the morning so that the donuts are freshly made daily!  Yeu, the owner, serves not only your common popular donuts, but he also serves donuts with bacon on top, apple fritters, pigs in a blanket, breakfast pastries, and  kolaches....in addition to these yummy treats...he makes doughssants....they are what seems to be a scandalous marriage of a donut and a croissant...!!!!!!!! Need I say more? Yeah...you heard me. A doughssant! Worth the trip just to eat one of these!   Prices are considerably cheap! The doughssants are only $1.99 each! The regular donuts are about $.60 each!   These sweet donuts are my favorite treats to buy for my kid's school teachers...and they love them!   Coffee also served here!",
    "We have had a blast to each event we've been to.  We've been to concerts and basketball games and other were a lot of fun.  The food is really good, also.  A lot of local favorites are offered.",
    "Excellent food. We tried three appetizers and five entries and all of them were a hit. This prices are reasonable and the service is good. I'd go back again and again.",
    "The service here has gone down. We used to go here a lot but now we go to another one. The service was slow and forgotten about.",
    "Hands down the worst chicken and rice plate I've ever had. When I ordered I was told there was no sauce on the chicken (as I wanted, healthy). I ordered to go, by the time I reached the car the bag was full of oil spilling out of the container. There was easily 5-7 tablespoons of oil on the dish. Not what I was told and not what anyone would ever want to eat. Horrible.   Their slogan even has the word healthy in it. What a joke.",
    "Great experience purchasing a washer and dryer.  I just bought a new home and needed all new appliances. Iam so glad I decided to go even though the reviews were not great which I don't understand since I had no issues whatsoever. There was an excellent selection, knowledgeable salespeople and timely delivery. The level of service we received was beyond expected! I really felt like they were working hard to give me the best price and offered many options to stay in my budget  They even took the time to check if there were any additional sales prices or discounts they could offer me. I was given honest feedback and all of my questions were answered. I am very happy with Sears and I would highly recommend!",
    "The food here is great. They're quick and the staff is so nice, seriously. I always feel welcome when I place my order here.",
    "I finally got to try them. Wow..they did a great job with the remodle. I loved the mushroom cheese steak",
    "The espresso here is excellent. My favorite place to come for an Americano. The staff is polite and friendly and vibes are mellow. It is important to know that there is no access to power outlets, but unlimited wifi access. The bathrooms and the rest of the establishment are always clean.",
    "Went here based on the high ratings and raves from people.  The entire experience was underwhelming from start to finish.  Their website which is fairly useless if you want to figure out the menu before going, you have to pick your location choice out of 3 locations and then drill down to the bottom to see the weak descriptions of their menu offering, no explanations and no price, just this      Roast Beef     Roast Beef Combo     Roast Pork     Roast Pork Combo     Baked Ham     Baked Ham Combo     Roast Turkey     Roast Turkey Combo     Broccoli Rabe     Broccoli Rabe Combo   No explanation of whats in a combo (its just where they add cheese by the way)  The table placecard (instead of menu) had a more detailed description than the website.    When I walked in, its more bar than restaurant, no big deal, but there were tables.  Since I couldnt decide and the sandwiches werent too expensive at $6.85, I got the roast beef and roast port combos.  I got my two sandwiches fast enough, but the roast beef was cold and the roast pork was hot.  Not sure how a cook (for lack of a better word) could serve 2 things at the same time with such a temperature differential, one was obviously sitting for awhile.  I asked the waitress to reheat the roast beef while I finished the roast pork, and supposedly it was reheated, since it was warmer, but it was still cold-ish compared to my roast pork I had just finished.  The waitress did offer to replace it when she inquired, but I was in a hurry and didnt really care for a hot version of this sandwich.  The sandwiches were very skimpy on meat, but they \"made up for it\" by adding too much gravy to make it overly messy and the bread was disintegrating.  The menu place card mentions the \"wet meat\" option where you get less gravy, I strongly recommend you get it that style, especially if the gravy overpower the meat and structural integrity of the sandwich.",
    "Picked up takeout from Village Whiskey (so I can't review the actual restaurant). The Whiskey Burger is pricy ($26) but is amazing if you're ok with a greasier burger. Super tender, the bacon is awesome and it's pretty big. If you can get past the price then highly recommend it. The Duck Fat fries are also rich and delicious.",
    "Blew $80 on food for the family was worth it food was hot and orange chicken best I've tasted in a awhile..now it will be the place we get Asian food!!",
    "I typically do my laundry at my boyfriend's house, but I had family who recently stayed with me and had a bunch of towels, sheets, and comforters to wash.  I was searching for a laundry mat that would be safe, clean and not full of questionable people.  I was so happy to find this facility.  It is clean, well-lit, and the staff is so friendly and helpful.  I was amazed at the speed of the laundry and dryer.  I completed 4 oversize loads ( probably equal to 8 regular loads) in just under 2 hours!  This place has security cameras, flat screen T.V's, magazines, wi-fi, clean bathrooms, vending machines.  It is a wonderful atmosphere to do your laundry.  It was not overly busy, there are plenty of washers and dryers.  I am so happy that I found this place.  Thank you LAUNDROMAT!!!",
    "We ran in for a late night dinner last night. The prices are definitely high. Both couples decided to split a plate (you could tell the annoyed our server), and the food was good- but not worth the price for sure. I will say the garlic bread they bring out before the meal was AH-MAZING! I could have probably eaten my weight in just the bread.   Overall - I probably wouldn't eat there again myself. But it could have been an off night. There is just too much competition in the food world around St Louis!",
    "Stopped by to munch a burger during today's Seahawks/Saints game, and the place was, unsurprisingly, packed. For good reason, too: the Haven burger I ordered was fantastic.  I sat right next to the door, so I didn't get the chance to get more than six feet into the place; as soon as I got my meal, the place started getting busier and busier until I had to work my way through the World's Shortest People Maze to get out. Guess that means I wasn't the first person to hear about the place.  I will be going back to the Haven. Might go for, say lunch on a Tuesday, so it's less busy.",
    "I can only comment on the vermicelli bowls because I have never had the Pho.   The vermicelli are a decent size and a fair price. Conveniently located if you live in the Alberta Ave neighbourhood, my orders have always been ready in 15 minutes - even on a Friday night.",
    "I had the Chicken Marsala recommended by our waiter. The chicken was very thin, tough, and dry. The pasta was under cooked and stuck together. There was absolutely no flavor. My friend ordered the lasagne and did not like it all. There was only a thin layer of pasta and no flavor. My other friend was still eating her dinner and they cleared her plate when she went to the restroom, after she told the waiter she was not finished. They did bring her a new meal in a doggie bag. The positives are a Great atmosphere and live music. I enjoyed dancing with my husband. However, very expensive for awful food.",
    "This place is a gem.Attractive space, great location near Broad Street line, plenty on street parking. BYOB. I've been twice and enjoyed every dish. Highlights were the chaats, beef short ribs, lamb vindaloo, beet salad, breads/pickles, and chai. We got the chocolate cake for the table to share each time and everyone loved it. Can get takeout beer at the corner bar. We'll be back.",
    "This is my favorite restaurant!  I always order their ceviche, which is delicious.  The atmosphere is fun, and the service is great.  Alex was our server, and he was friendly, attentive and thoughtful.",
    "Love this store!  Who doesn't!  The salad bar is fresh and they have all types of ethnic food to try.  N-JOY",
    "Called in a Mediterranean chicken shawarma. Good flavor and they were generous with the amount of chicken in the pita. The food was ready to go when I arrived. Good service. I would revisit the next time I am in the area.",
    "I love this place.  The food is great and the space and staff are very pleasant.  Highly recommended for vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike.",
    "Took a while to get actual service but once we did I was happy. The gumbo was awesome and loved the chicken & waffles. Friendly staff and right on Bourbon St for good people watching!",
    "As airport grab-and-go restaurants are, Earl does a decent job with a variety of sandwich options including turkey, tuna and even a Hawaiian. But today I could smell the roast beef and so I got that one. Yum. Good portion of sliced beef that was beyond medium cooked with cheddar cheese and a yummy horseradish sauce. Nope, don't get lettuce or tomatoes on it. It's perfect the way it is.  And since it's right between the security station and the top of the D gates (right near the Delta SkyClub!), it's easy to get and eat at the gate or on board.",
    "WOW!  What a fantastic place!  Food A+, Service A+++  We started with an appetizer of cheese curds served with a red pepper jelly.  LOVED IT!  I ordered the fish tacos and the wife ordered a beer brat for dinner.  We both thoroughly enjoyed what we ordered!  The portions were huge and priced just right for the portion size.  Our server was on it!  Very attentive and was very knowledgeable about the menu and made us feel very welcomed.  The manager stopped by and asked how everything was.  I let him know that I am pretty sure I have found a cool new place to hang out, have a beer and watch football.  He said they have great deals on game days and let us know about their brunch on the weekends.  Everyone said goodbye as we walked out and reminded us to grab a rootbeer candy on our way out.  I will be back!",
    "I stopped in for dinner and a drink & was thoroughly pleased! I rarely order a burger when I go out to eat, because why order \"out\" what you can make easily a home, right? Well..... when I go back I'll have a hard time NOT getting another burger. Oh, they also have a decent beer selection and the wait staff/bartenders made me feel very welcomed too.  My food was prepared exactly as I ordered and was served quickly.  The restaurant has a nice atmosphere and the restrooms were clean.  All in all I was very happy! ."

    "If you choose to dine here, be prepared for a culinary journey that spans around 2 hours from start to finish. We've given it numerous tries, hoping each visit would capture the magic of its other New Jersey locations, where we’ve consistently enjoyed great experiences. The food here is undeniably delicious, but the painstakingly long wait for it to arrive can be quite the patience test. While the youthful waitstaff brings a burst of pleasant energy, their service often leaves us lingering far too long. Consequently, on weekends, we usually find ourselves gravitating towards other diners or restaurants where our meals come out more swiftly.",

    "Visited a family-owned diner and opted for the buffet. It offered an interesting variety: a sizable chicken leg, crispy fried jalapeño, a tamale, two rolled grape leaves, and some fresh melon. Everything was delicious. They had a multitude of Mexican dishes available. Their menu also features all-day breakfast options. The staff was friendly and attentive. It's a great spot for a casual and relaxed meal with no fuss. Conveniently located beside the Clarion Hotel.",
    "The exterior might not be the most inviting, and we almost skipped it, but stepping inside was a fantastic decision! What a delightful experience – a truly varied and flavorful menu. We were particularly impressed with the lamb curry and korma. Plus, there are 10 different kinds of naan to choose from! Definitely worth a visit if you're looking for something different and delicious.",
    "Charming interior and friendly owner (?) provided a tour of the soon-to-be-open patio/rooftop space, which will be perfect for lovely days like today. The cheese curds were delicious and quite filling. I appreciated that the sandwiches came with a salad, especially after indulging in so many curds! I had the onion, gruyere, and tomato sandwich. It had a good amount of cheese, but I felt it needed something extra, perhaps pepper jelly. I would love to see more menu options, like salads with unique cheeses. There's a wide selection of beer and wine as well as a few cocktails. Next time, I'll definitely try one of the draft wines.",
    "As a loyal, long-time customer, I was shocked when my take-out order for three appetizers was refused because they were \"too busy\"—despite the place being half empty. I'm a generous tipper, and this treatment is unacceptable. I'll be taking my business to Kanella from now on! I won't be returning to Dmitris.",
    "I absolutely loved this tour! The Groupon deal made it an excellent value. As a first-time visitor to New Orleans with little knowledge of its history, this was the perfect introduction. Our tour guide shared fascinating insights about the city, making the experience thoroughly enjoyable. I initially expected to only tour the cemetery, but we spent the first hour exploring the French Quarter and the second hour in the cemetery, which was a fantastic surprise. We met in front of a grocery store—easy to find and convenient for grabbing water. There was also a stop at a visitor center for a bathroom break. This tour was a highlight of my trip and comes highly recommended!",
    "Incredibly delicious wings paired with homemade bleu cheese. Tried the ribeye, which was tender, impeccably cooked, and flavorful. Great variety of craft beers available. Highly recommend discovering this hidden treasure.",
    "This Easter, instead of going to Lopez Lake, we visited Los Padres National Forest. The forest is really beautiful, but if you go to White Rock, you'll notice that the staff needs to cut down all the dead grass that covers the rock and the surrounding water. It would be great if they could clean up or remove the dead grass along the water's edge as well. The water itself looks quite green and dirty. The staff at Los Padres National Forest really need to put in more effort to keep the forest looking nice and not like a mess. Even Cachuma Lake seems better maintained.",
    "Our group of six dined here for hibachi. Disappointingly, our waitress delivered our individual sushi orders on a single plate, making it challenging to distinguish whose order was whose. Moreover, several items were omitted from an order. Considering the restaurant was notably quiet, these mistakes were unexpected. Typically, hibachi dining is an engaging and lively experience; however, our cook, Francisco, spoke only a few words, despite his excellent cooking skills. The service was subpar, though the food quality was satisfactory. I hope this was an isolated incident, but given the cost, I wouldn't consider returning.",
    "My experience with Shalimar was exceptional. I needed my engagement ring resized and was informed over the phone that it could likely be done within the day. When I brought it in, the team confirmed that the jeweler could accommodate my same-day request, estimating the cost at around $40 for a simple band adjustment (decreased by three full sizes). \n\nI double-checked my size, confirmed, and left the ring with them. Later that afternoon, I came to pick it up and found it too small. It's crucial to note that Shalimar sized the ring perfectly according to my instructions, but I had made an error and should have gone up a half-size.\n\nThe Shalimar staff were incredibly understanding and accommodating, resizing the ring back up and returning it to me within an hour at no additional charge, despite my mistake. Their empathetic and professional response to what was quite an embarrassing situation instantly earned my satisfaction and loyalty as a customer. I am very grateful for such a wonderful experience.",
    "Locals recommended Milktooth, and it's an amazing jewel of Indianapolis. I'm glad I had the chance to experience this.",
    "I absolutely love coming here for happy hour or dinner! The patio is fantastic with fans to keep you cool in the StL heat. The staff are super accommodating at this location. I personally enjoy the Veal Milanese with mixed greens instead of pasta, and they're happy to customize the menu to suit your taste!",
    "The food was excellent—I particularly enjoyed the gnocchi with marinara sauce, and the baked eggplant appetizer was also very tasty. Although the service was very slow, I would still return because the food is that good.",
    "The bun is what makes the Sonoran Dog special. It's like a cozy blanket for the hot dog. At first, it seems excessive, just like the popular blanket with sleeves—too soft, too squishy, too indulgent. But it’s not. The bun is warm, soft, chewy, and fragrant, and it excels where other Sonoran Dogs fall short. The hot dog itself is tasty, though I wish the hot dog or the bacon had more crunch to stand up better to the strong flavors of the mustard and onions. I'm a fan of the carne asada caramelo, too. It has an excellent tortilla, salty, melty cheese, and great carne. Plus, it's super cheap and available at the drive-through.",
    "Fantastic breakfast spot! Indulged in the most perfectly fluffy waffle and delightfully crispy home fries. The friendly waitstaff made the experience even better. Can't wait to return!",
    "Exceptional service (special commendation to Douglas) that perfectly complemented the delectable cuisine. Although it is a rather expensive establishment (with main courses averaging $40-50), it justifies this pricing with an atmosphere comparable to any of the premier restaurants nationwide.",
    "My husband and I have dined here several times, and each visit has been delightful. The entire staff, from the servers to the bartender, is well-versed in the menu and could quickly suggest dishes that I could enjoy as-is, modify, or omit ingredients to accommodate my Celiac dietary needs. The selection of wines and cocktails is exceptional, and the food is absolutely delicious. My only minor complaint is the lack of a gluten-free dessert option, which means we usually go somewhere else for a sweet treat. Nonetheless, this doesn’t diminish our enthusiasm for returning again and again.",
    "I go to Blow Bar to get my eyebrows done by Natalie, who is a brows specialist and highly recommended. She does an amazing job on my brows! I also got a blowout from Victoria and was totally impressed. I have thin, straight, lifeless hair, and she gave me the most volume I’ve ever had! I tried another stylist once, but I didn’t love it as much, so Victoria is now my go-to. The place is also very clean and beautiful!",
    "This cafe is, without a doubt, my absolute favorite in the entire city. Their black and white latte stands out as the finest I have ever tasted, striking a perfect balance with its subtle sweetness and ideal amount of foam. The soups they serve are consistently outstanding, so much so that even those who typically do not enjoy soup will find them delightful. Additionally, the ample space available makes it an ideal spot for getting work done. The noise level is meticulously maintained at just the right volume, and the music contributes to a perfect ambiance. One of the highlights for me is seeing patrons bring their dogs, which always adds a touch of warmth to the atmosphere. I am committed to patronizing this wonderful establishment for as long as possible.",
    "Amazingly delicious frozen custard with actual pumpkin pie bits, including pie crust chunks. Why hasn't this become a national hit? Super yummy!",
    "Upland Brewery, hailing from Bloomington, Indiana, has garnered such a following that they've expanded to several locations across central Indiana. Renowned for their exceptional beers, as well as their mouth-watering burgers and tenderloins, Upland has set a high standard. Naturally, I was eager to sample their pizza. However, my experience left much to be desired. The margherita pizza featured a cracker-like crust and was rather insubstantial. While the cheese was of high quality, the other toppings were underwhelming in flavor, and surprisingly, it lacked the traditional red sauce that defines a classic margherita pizza. In my view, Upland's pizza might make for a decent appetizer shared among friends, but I'll be sticking with their exemplary burgers or tenderloins for my main course on future visits.",
    "I absolutely loved the show! It was the perfect way to unwind and kick off the weekend.",
    "Sure, here is a rephrased version:\n\nIndeed, this is the sole sushi restaurant in town. Nevertheless, it's perfect for satisfying your sushi cravings when you're short on time to go elsewhere. The salmon is likely their top choice, which is why we consistently order it. Additionally, we are fond of their spicy edamame, tempura, ocean salad, and cabbage salad. The service has always been friendly and efficient!",
    "I was torn between giving this 3 or 4 stars. I absolutely adore the 96th Street Naked Tchopstix, so I was thrilled to see this closer-to-home branch. However, the vibe here is quite different, leaning more towards takeout despite having a sizable dining area. You place your order at the counter, and they bring it to you.\n\nMy daughter and I went for the sushi bowl. The ordering process is simple: pick up a piece of paper and select your preferred proteins, vegetables, rice, and toppings. I appreciate this method since it avoids the confusion and noise of speaking to the server directly. The sushi bowl was good overall, though not exceptional. The vegetable options felt limited, and the rice portion overshadowed the other ingredients. The sauces, however, were delicious.\n\nMy husband had the Maui roll, which is my favorite at the 96th Street location, but it didn’t quite measure up here. It was good, just not as high-quality or consistent as what I'm used to. Nonetheless, I’d return, and I believe many people would enjoy the sushi bowls.\n\nI also want to address the low service reviews. Remember, this is a sushi place, not a fast-food joint like McDonald’s. It’s naturally a bit slower, and you won’t be in and out in five minutes, even though it’s labeled \"express.\" As a healthier alternative to fast food in the area, I find it worth the wait.\n\nOh, and definitely try the bubble tea. I had the strawberry, and it was quite delicious. Next time, I’m eager to try the vanilla chai.",
    "Had lunch and enjoyed a beef brisket sandwich that was incredibly juicy and tender. The pulled pork was equally delicious!",
    "This place has the best Thai food around! Everything tasted genuinely authentic and super delicious. I'll definitely be coming back often!",
    "The service was poor and the food was average. I regret not choosing a different place for my final dinner in town.",
    "I recently dined here with my wife over the weekend and was thoroughly impressed! Our meal was fantastic! We were amazed by the speedy service and how quickly our food arrived. Everything tasted fresh and homemade, which we both loved. The only challenge was choosing from the menu because there were so many tempting options. We will definitely be back to try more dishes! Excited to see what the next chef specials will be!",
    "I have to give this restaurant at least two stars for the decent food. However, during a dinner meeting where I spent $100 on entrées and appetizers, I had to flag down the assistant cook (the guy in bright red baggy pants watching TV) to ask for more avocado for my tuna entrée. He made it clear he couldn't help and said I needed to ask my waitress so she could charge me $4 for the avocado.",
    "My first visit was outstanding! The atmosphere is welcoming, as if you're entering someone's home. The waitstaff are both humorous and friendly. The food was served promptly and tasted phenomenal. I will definitely be returning.",
    "Great burgers, fries, and salad! The burgers have a nice hint of salt and pepper. This place is super charming, though they only offer outdoor seating. The staff is really friendly. There's street parking and a lot in the back too.",
    "The staff here is incredibly helpful and unfailingly friendly. The store is immaculate and spacious, consistently stocked with all the essentials. They even go above and beyond to craft my custom breakfast bagel to perfection!",
    "A few years ago, I brought my vehicle to this place for some work due to a manufacturer recall. They successfully resolved the initial problem, but afterwards, I started hearing another noise that I assumed was related. It turned out to be an entirely different issue. Kevin and his mechanic promptly hoisted my car and fixed the new problem at no cost, despite my offer to pay. Their exceptional service and generosity truly impressed me. I highly recommend them!",
    "Following my Review of the Day yesterday of another Sweet CeCe's location, I realized I hadn't reviewed my usual spot! Anyway, I'm a huge fan of their product – absolutely love it. Their topping selection is usually fantastic, offering a good balance between healthy and indulgent options. Occasionally, the staff can be inattentive or hard to find, and sometimes you need to remind them about promotions like $5 Friday. Despite these issues, I can't rate it less than 4 stars because I just adore it so much.",
    "What a fantastic addition to the Funk Zone! Enjoy a bite and some tastings—life is good. Conveniently located right next door to the Santa Barbara Wine Collective, it even shares the same tables. We indulged in a fabulous savory croissant.",
    "A great spot to unwind and get a massage! It’s super easy to snag a same-day appointment, and I’ve always been happy with every therapist I’ve seen there!",
    "We arrived for check-in at approximately 2:30 pm. The process was swift and uncomplicated, complemented by the generous provision of complimentary valet parking, which we greatly appreciated. The Peppermill Resort is vast, evoking the grandeur of Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. It boasts around eight diverse restaurants that cater to nearly every culinary craving imaginable. The casino area is expansive, on par with some of the largest in Las Vegas. However, we did notice a deceptive practice: many slot machines were labeled as penny machines, yet the minimum bets ranged from 30 cents to $5, which felt misleading.\n\nWe stayed in the Tuscany Tower on the 12th floor, where our room offered a pleasant view of the extensive pool area. The room itself was spacious and included a variety of amenities such as complimentary WiFi, a sizable bathroom with a large shower equipped with two shower heads, a television, a large jetted bathtub, and a convenient phone next to the commode. The bathroom also featured dual sinks and ample counter space, along with a generous supply of towels. The main living area was roomy, furnished with a king bed, nightstands, a closet, a second television, a mini-fridge, a dresser with two drawers, a safe, a table suitable for a computer or writing, complimentary bottles of water, and three well-upholstered chairs along with a table. The thermostat was effective at maintaining a comfortable temperature. \n\nThroughout our stay, we found the staff to be courteous and helpful. Overall, the facilities and service contributed to a very enjoyable experience.",
    "My boyfriend and I visited this deli for the first time today. I enjoyed a turkey, avocado, and bacon panini, while he had a buffalo chicken wrap. We will definitely be coming back. The wait for food was reasonable, which is always a plus during lunch hour. The menu had an impressive variety with salads, soups, macaroni, sandwiches, and hot dishes. I love a deli with so many choices!",
    "Incredible biscuits and (fill in the blank) that will blow your mind! The cocktails are top-notch as well. Absolutely a must-visit! Just be prepared for a lively crowd.",
    "The food was excellent, and the atmosphere and decor resemble a fishing lodge. The menu is somewhat a mix between Outback and Bonefish. We visited using a Groupon, and all three of our meals along with the calamari appetizer were cooked perfectly. We will definitely return.",
    "The restaurant feels cheap and tastes cheap. \n\nThe Good:\n- Cheap prices\n- Convenient location\n- Edible desserts\n- Varied food selection: baked and fried chicken, mashed potatoes, salad bar, meat and cheese bar, ravioli, pizza\n- Excellent waitress\n\nThe Meh:\n- Meat slicing station\n- Not deveined shrimp\n- Mexican station\n\nThe Bad:\n- Breakfast: worst eggs, uncuttably tough ham and English muffins (tried 3 times)\n- Steak and shrimp below par\n- Breaded items are unappetizing\n- Outdated 1970s decor\n\nTried three times and was disappointed each time.",
    "I almost gave this restaurant a 5-star rating, but one pretentious waiter held me back. As a guest at Hotel Palomar for four nights, I found the restaurant's location very convenient. On my first night, a coworker and I decided to have cocktails there. The host staff was busy when we arrived, so we just seated ourselves at a small table near the bar since the restaurant wasn’t too crowded.\n\nA waiter approached, and I quickly asked if it was okay for us to sit there and explained we were only having cocktails. He responded rather rudely and walked away mid-sentence, not making us feel welcome at all. Despite this, we tried to enjoy our time but got a strong vibe that he couldn't be bothered with us. When we asked to split the bill due to company policy, he acted as if we asked for something unreasonable. We left, shocked by his rudeness.\n\nAlthough that experience was off-putting and we initially decided to avoid the restaurant on subsequent nights, we gave it another try the next evening. This time, we carefully checked that the waiter from the previous night wasn’t on duty. We sat at the bar and were immediately welcomed by the bartender, who could not have been more different. I believe his name was Ben, and he was absolutely fantastic! Friendly, knowledgeable, and genuinely interested in making our experience great, Ben taught us about whiskey, classic cocktails, and more. He completely turned around our perception of the place.\n\nI also tried room service from the restaurant, and it did not disappoint. The bacon-wrapped dates and chocolate cake were incredible! Overall, the restaurant is great, and the bartender(s) truly stand out. It’s a shame one bad experience almost ruined it for us, but Ben made all the difference.",
    "After enjoying a Sunday morning walk in the park, I decided to stop by this place. The food was exceptional, the coffee was superb, and the customer service was outstanding. The overall vibe in here is absolutely delightful, adding to a wonderful experience.",
    "In a word... \"OVERRATED!\". The food took forever. My burger was way overcooked (I asked for Medium Rare) and the Seafood Jumbalaya was just okay. Definitely not worth the price. There are better spots to eat in the French Quarter. It wasn't horrible, but with all the hype, I expected a lot more.",
    "The accommodations provided a remarkably comfortable bed, an excellent breakfast, swift internet connectivity, an ideal location, and competitive pricing. Overall, my impressions of this establishment were exceedingly favorable. However, it is worth noting that guests staying on the upper floors might experience delays of up to 15 minutes for elevator service during the morning hours.",
    "NEVER AGAIN. This establishment fails to meet the basic expectations of a restaurant, aside from merely preparing food; patrons are left to handle everything else. If you desire water, you must fetch it yourself from across the yard. Interested in a drink? You'll need to walk up a flight of stairs and pay in cash. The seating consists of dirty lawn chairs in an unkempt yard. The wait staff offers minimal assistance, delivering your food only after you've paid for it at the window in cash—reminiscent of New Orleans Hamburger and Seafood, but with inferior cleanliness and the added presence of live music, which is at least a pleasant touch. This was a once-in-a-lifetime experience for me—just once.",
    "If you prefer paying for everything a la carte, this place is for you. The food was not terrible but not impressive either. They initially brought a basket of chips and tomato sauce. I asked for something spicier and some pico de gallo, which they provided happily. The salsa was much better. When I asked for a Coke, they brought a bottle, and I specified I wanted the fountain drink. She informed me that only Pepsi was available on tap, without mentioning Coke was only in bottles.\n\nWe ordered reasonably priced food, but were informed that cheese on the taco would cost extra. It was also $2.50 for an additional basket of chips. Upon receiving the bill, we noticed we paid more for condiments than for the actual food: sour cream was $2, pico de gallo $2.50, salsa $2, chips $2.50, cheese $1, and the bottled Coke we didn't want was $5. Just a suggestion: when ordering, always ask if there is an extra charge.",
    "The cafe exuded charm. Arriving at 8 am, we were pleasantly surprised by a live jazz band serenading us. I opted for the breakfast sandwich, which was a delightful choice. The egg was skillfully rolled with bacon bits tucked inside. For a hearty meal, it was an excellent value!",
    "On a scale of one to awesome, this place is phenomenal. Attracted by the promise of duck-fat French fries, I took my son here for his birthday. We put our name on the waitlist, enjoyed a drink around the corner, and were seated at the bar in about 45 minutes. Keith, the bartender, was friendly, knowledgeable about his whiskeys, and an all-around great guy. We started with Cape May Salts (two for me, one for my son) and tater tots, both of which were delightful. I had the Kentucky Fried Quail for dinner, which was outstanding, though the succotash was a bit underwhelming. My son ordered the $24 Foie Gras burger, which was incredible and worth every penny. While the duck-fat fries were tasty, they weren't the highlight of the meal. The cheese sauce on the side was unnecessary but didn’t detract from the experience. I can’t wait to return and share this place with everyone I know.",
    "We kicked off our meal with what we thought would be a delightful artichoke dip, but boy, were we wrong. It arrived colder than a winter’s day and the chips were disappointingly stale. We mentioned this to our waitress, hoping for a resolution, but sadly, nothing changed.\n\nNext, we ordered a large thin-crust pizza, which ended up being quite the wallet-drainer once we added our favorite toppings. When it finally arrived, it was just OK—not the mouthwatering masterpiece we'd hoped for. \n\nDespite our server not really stepping up for us when we needed it, she was otherwise quite good at her job. I’ve been to this place before, especially during Cardinals games, and it was much better back then. Unfortunately, this visit fell flat, so it looks like we’ll be exploring new dining spots next time around.",
    "It was my fiancé's birthday, and he wanted a relaxed evening at a good Thai restaurant. Yelp led us to Jasmine Rice, and it turned out to be an excellent choice. We initially craved summer rolls, which were listed on the menu but apparently only available in the summer, so we opted for the pan-fried dumplings instead. While they had good flavor, we likely wouldn’t order them again. \n\nFor our mains, we chose the green curry fried rice with duck and the chicken pad thai. Both dishes were delightful, but the duck was exceptional—some of the best I’ve ever tasted. The pad thai was a bit on the sweet side for our liking, so we might try a different noodle dish next time, although it was still quite tasty, especially with a touch of chili sauce.\n\nOur service was commendable, though we noticed other diners had some issues. One table, in a hurry to catch a show at the Kimmel Center, had a lengthy wait for their meal and risked being late. Another take-out customer was missing an item, but the owner went above and beyond by personally delivering the dish to their home. \n\nAll in all, Jasmine Rice offers quality Thai food, and we look forward to returning.",
    "I can't get enough of Courtney! She’s hands down the BEST hairstylist I’ve ever had. What makes her so amazing is her knack for knowing exactly what suits me, plus she totally respects my style limits. Every time I walk into the salon, I just let her work her magic. No specific requests, just pure trust in her talent. And every single time, I leave completely wowed by her work! You know you've found a gem of a stylist when they can see what needs to be done without you saying a word. She's not just an incredible stylist—she's got a fantastic personality and a wealth of knowledge, too. If you want to look and feel your absolute best, I can’t recommend Courtney highly enough!",
    "During the time I lived nearby, I visited this location frequently. Although it is part of a chain and lacks a certain allure, it serves its purpose on numerous occasions. For an oil change, this place is satisfactory, and they also handle state inspections efficiently. The trick is to arrive when they aren't busy; otherwise, expect a wait. In summary, while it's nothing extraordinary—a Pep Boys is a Pep Boys—the service provided is generally decent.",
    "Replaced two old Lennox units from the 1970s with two new ones. They did an excellent job, and the new units have been running smoothly for three years now.",
    "I love the Brewpub for their wide range of dishes—nachos, pizza, and sandwiches. They also have a great selection of beers, all brewed right there. While the service can be slow, it seems to be just the relaxed pace of the restaurant. It’s not the place for a quick bite and a beer; instead, take your time to enjoy the patio and hang out with friends. The venue is kid and dog-friendly and perfect for vegetarian and vegan friends too. My go-to orders are a half order of nachos or the fish & chips. I also tried their Pumpkin Seasonal Beer, and it’s definitely up there with some of my favorites.",
    "Looking for something farmhouse, rustic, or chic? The helpful staff here have great ideas to decorate your home, and the prices are reasonable too! They carry items from Joanna Gaines (Fixer Upper) and much more. It's so nice to finally have a good home store in SB with such great prices.",
    "My brother came to visit, and we decided to grab a six-pack of top-notch beers for an epic night in. We ended up hanging out, having a few, and diving into some intense Super Smash Brothers sessions on the Nintendo 64—generously donated by fellow patrons! This place is amazing, with delicious food and truly awesome people. It deserves to be a Northeast legend!",
    "My favorite dishes are coconut soup and pad thai with protein. I tried the same menu here and actually really liked their coconut soup. They used enough coconut milk to make the soup really creamy without too many herbs. I'm used to Americanized Thai food, so I prefer fewer herbs on my dish, except for cilantro. The pad thai was great too. I liked the amount of peanuts they used, the noodles were perfect and chewy, and it wasn't too sweet. They gave me a generous amount of chicken, which wasn't dry, so I was very happy with my meal.",
    "Outstanding service! The diner offers fantastic food, with breakfast available all day. We visited for lunch; despite the crowd, the staff was incredibly friendly and welcoming. Conveniently located off the 295.",
    "My favorite place to hang out on a Saturday night! I was really bummed when Lucy’s closed, but I was pleasantly surprised by this bar just across the street. Their food is better than I expected—I always get the wings and fries (just be careful with the WTF sauce). Sometimes, it takes a while to get the bartender’s attention since the place is usually packed. And if you’re lucky, you might even see the \"It's Always Sunny\" crew pop in!",
    "We were a bit hesitant about trying the Shellfish Company on the Wharf because places like this (such as those on Cannery Row in Monterey) often take advantage of tourists, offering overpriced and low-quality food. However, influenced by the consistently good reviews on Yelp, we decided to give it a chance. The restaurant is small, so plan ahead. Expect a wait, or try visiting during off-peak hours. Fortunately, our wait was only about 20 minutes as the dinner rush was winding down.\n\nThe special was local rock crab - $25 for 3 lbs of California Rock Crab, salad, and your choice of soup or chowder. After seeing a few trays of rock crab served to other tables, my wife and I decided to order it since it looked delicious.\n\nThe salad and chowder were great, with generous portions. Although I enjoyed the chowder, my wife's Shrimp Bisque was amazing, and I would recommend choosing that. \n\nNow, onto the main dish: the rock crab tasted as fantastic as it looked. It had juicy, buttery chunks of white crab meat that were easy to access once the thick shells were cracked. The shells broke apart easily, indicating they were perfectly cooked. The rock crab offered a substantial amount of meat with minimal effort, making it a great choice.\n\nWe were thoroughly satisfied with our meal, and the special was a great value. Enjoying the Rock Crab at SBSC turned out to be one of the highlights of our trip. Ordering crab here is definitely a safe bet.",
    "I'm absolutely in love with Weaver's Way and genuinely disagree with some of the previous reviews out there. This co-op isn't designed for convenience shopping in the traditional sense, but that's precisely what makes it special. As a single woman, I have zero trouble shopping here, even during peak times. In fact, it's ideal for solo shoppers like me because I can buy smaller quantities than what you'd find at big corporate stores like Acme.\n\nI also love the work hours. Over the years, I've worked in various parts of the store, and lately, I've been involved in the membership committee, which has been incredibly rewarding. The community here is diverse and not just a bunch of \"tree huggers\" and \"earth children\"—it's a vibrant mix of like-minded people from all sorts of backgrounds.\n\nOne of the highlights for me is the access to locally grown produce and preservative-free, natural foods at prices far more reasonable than Whole Foods. Plus, the sense of community is unparalleled. I thoroughly enjoy interacting with other members and feel a sense of accomplishment knowing I'm contributing to both my local and global community.\n\nBeing single, I don't find the membership fee or work hours to be a burden at all. However, I understand that co-op membership might not be for everyone, especially if you're making decisions as a family. But if you're excited about Weaver's Way values, you won't find a better place to shop. If not, you can always stick to chain stores or pay the 10% visitor’s fee for occasional visits.",
    "Frankly, the cuisine here does not particularly impress me, although it appears to be a favorite among many others. I frequent this establishment mainly because my husband enjoys it; personally, I would prefer to patronize a different barbecue venue. Admittedly, the experience may vary depending on one's menu selections.",
    "For $4.99, the TV shows come with commercials—talk about a tacky cash grab! It's definitely not what you'd expect from a hotel charging over $150 a night. And forget about a complimentary breakfast; instead, there's just an overpriced buffet. Even the most budget-friendly hotels in California offer free breakfast!",
    "I visited this shop near my hotel and was impressed by the friendly staff. The buy one get one deal is fantastic. I tried the hot wings, loaded with delicious sauce, and loved them. I'll definitely return for more pizza next time I'm in town!",
    "I've only tried the cannolis here, and they are amazing! They fill them fresh when you order and the filling is fantastic. It's not too sweet, just perfect. Whether you like cannolis or think you don't, you should definitely try one from Termini Bros.",
    "While traveling in our RV, we stopped in Granite City and discovered a great cafe. The staff was friendly and welcoming. The home-style cooking was fantastic. We ate there twice, and every dish was fresh and delicious.",
    "After just 3 weeks of exploring the area, I finally discovered a gem off Magazine that's not overrated! The staff here are super friendly! And you know my love for Phò - it's absolutely amazing!",
    "Absolutely! Here's the revised text:\n\n\"We were thrilled to return for breakfast with our family this weekend, and once again, the food and service were impeccable! Highly recommend!\"",
    "Our kayaking tour at Santa Cruz Island was absolutely fantastic! My husband and I had an incredible time. Jen, our tour guide, was both helpful and informative. We had a blast exploring the caves, and the whole experience surpassed our expectations.",
    "I highly recommend this place to anyone seeking a delicious meal at a reasonable price. The shrimp and goat cheese crepes are an absolute must-try!",
    "After living in the St. Louis area for well over a decade, I am both embarrassed and regretful to admit that I only ate here for the first time a few weeks ago. I'm embarrassed because it's a St. Louis tradition and regretful because I missed out on it for so many years! This place is incredible. What's not to love? It's a factory that offers tours (Friday-Sunday, noon to 5pm on the hour), has a shop, bar, and dining area. They also host numerous events with live music on the weekends. It's fun to wander around and explore—don’t worry, you'll likely have time since there often is a wait before you can dine. The beer is phenomenal; the Hefeweizen is my personal favorite and a great choice for those who aren't big beer drinkers (like myself). Additionally, the food is locally sourced and delicious. I had the pizza, recommended by my server, and it was truly outstanding—even as a pizza connoisseur, I enjoyed it immensely. My date had a bison burger, which was also excellent. \n\nMore fun info: the service is fantastic! The staff tends to be more eclectic and alternative, similar to those you might find in a tattoo parlor, which I support. What makes this place stand out is its quality and focus on local food and brewing. It is a bit on the pricier side, but for the experience and quality you get, it's worth it. I will definitely be returning, and I highly recommend you do too!",
    "If I could give it a zero, I would. I ordered a plain hamburger and realized they put bacon in it (which I'm allergic to and can’t eat) after two bites. I went back to the drive-through to complain (didn't realize the restaurant was open; it was almost 2, after all…), and the guy took the burger back without saying anything and disappeared. After 2 minutes of awkwardly chatting with the people in the next car, he came back and rudely told me I had to go inside to get my food. So, I did. Still didn't get an apology. I'm not going back there after that ordeal, which is a shame because it’s nice to have variety after DT. Guess I’ll stick with Freebirds!",
    "First time here, and WOW, they did an AMAZING job! I'm absolutely thrilled with the car wash and the fantastic service I received. Thank you so much!",
    "I just started going to Sushi Nara this month; they opened recently. I love it there because it's clean, the staff are friendly and helpful, and the service is fast. The sushi is always delicious (I've been there 3 times), and the prices are fair. This week, my husband got takeout with 4 sushi rolls for just $24. The food is fresh with a huge variety. Everyone on the eastside should check it out!",
    "Fantastic little shop. The owner is exceptionally knowledgeable and clearly passionate about his work. They stock tires and other unique parts that are hard to find elsewhere.",
    "Visited this place numerous times and all I can express is that the cuisine is excellent. A treasure tucked away in Florissant, it boasts the finest Panang curry around. I have yet to try their sister restaurant, but I find it hard to move on when I am consistently pleased with the food here.",
    "My food only merited two stars, but I'll give an extra star for the appealing menu and unique design and concept. Unfortunately, the tomato-basil soup tasted like weak marinara, and the tuna melt had an overwhelmingly citrusy, off-putting flavor—perhaps due to excessive lemon zest. Next time, I'll focus on dishes with cured Italian meats like mortadella and prosciutto, as well as the enticing baked goods, especially the Nutella bruschetta.",
    "We visited the establishment once and were considerably disappointed with both my vegetable pizza and my husband's sub sandwich. The tomato sauce lacked flavor, and there was an insufficient amount of cheese on my pizza. The dough appeared and tasted as though it had been machine-prepared. While it is possible that improvements have been made since our visit, we are not inclined to return in the near future.",
    "A few friends and I decided to grab some late-night milkshakes and ended up at More Than Just Ice Cream. Despite the name, we only ordered ice cream. We got three milkshakes: a coffee, a chocolate, and a black & white malt. They were all quite good and definitely satisfied our ice cream craving. However, I felt my coffee milkshake and the chocolate one could have been thicker. The black & white malt, on the other hand, had the perfect thickness and was the best of the three. Unfortunately, I didn't order that one, so I ended up with my less creamy coffee milkshake. Before settling on a milkshake, I sampled a few ice cream flavors and found the pumpkin pie flavor to be AMAZING. In hindsight, I should have just gone with that. Perhaps milkshakes aren't the best choice here.",
    "We celebrated my mother's 100th birthday here, and every detail exceeded our expectations. From a prime table with a stunning view to delicious chef's compliments and a beautifully decorated cake plate, the warm and attentive service made it an unforgettable experience. This celebration was truly exceptional.",
    "Wow! This place is fantastic. The bartender is awesome. You’ve got to try the burger – it's super fresh with all local ingredients. The plates of food I saw looked amazing too. The beer is perfectly cold, and the drinks are mixed just right. It’s not a chain restaurant but a wonderful local spot with great staff.",
    "During my 5-day stay, I frequented this restaurant four times. Unbelievable, right? Here are some reasons why:\n\n- We stayed at a nearby hotel.\n- The restaurant's hours are convenient, open from 11 AM to 10:30 PM daily, even on New Year's Day.\n- As a party of two, we were usually seated immediately.\n- Oysters are priced at $9 per dozen, which is quite a bargain!\n- There’s a seafood shop next door offering both boiled and fresh seafood to go.\n- Our server, who attended to us each time, was very friendly and recognized us.\n\nHowever, here are the reasons for giving it only 3 stars:\n\n- Despite trying various items, everything was rather mediocre. The raw oysters were not well cleaned. If your schedule allows, head to Superior Seafood during their happy hour for 50-cent oysters—better quality and cheaper. The turtle soup had an odd taste, so I prefer Felix's. Some of the boiled shrimp were always mushy, possibly overcooked.\n- While the ambiance is inviting, it's not particularly comfortable, so we usually just ate and left.\n- The bathrooms need cleaning!\n\nI might return if I’m in the area again, or just quickly pick up some seafood to go.",
    "I would advise against dining at this establishment if you are seeking a satisfactory meal. Our server appeared to be quite inexperienced and disoriented, leading us to believe she was unfamiliar with the restaurant. We had to repeatedly request basic necessities such as table settings and water refills. Additionally, despite ordering chicken parmesan, we were served eggplant parmesan, which contained a fish bone. On a positive note, the beverages were well-prepared.",
    "TDS didn't quite meet my expectations. The restaurant has an uninviting atmosphere—cold and lacking character. With no decor, menu boards, or drink machines, and dining tables made of stainless steel prep tables, it didn’t feel welcoming. The abundance of unnamed staff (no uniforms or name tags) added to the impersonal vibe.\n\nWhile the food is reasonably priced and generally good, we found it frustrating that they charge for extra salsa. We had ordered a salsa trio, which came in small 2oz glass bowls. When my brother asked for additional salsa for his tacos—after we ordered one of every taco, three burritos, and guacamole—he was informed that he needed to purchase the trio again. Despite spending over $40 on food, drinks, and appetizers, they were still rigid about extra salsa.\n\nIn conclusion, although the food was decent, the overall experience was disappointing. I wouldn’t return due to the lackluster atmosphere and the policy on extra salsa.",
    "I'm thrilled with our pictures! Angela Clifton Photography has worked with us three times, and we've loved every single photo. Not only are the photos amazing, but we also had a fantastic time. The price is very reasonable, and we'll cherish these pictures forever!",
    "I enjoyed my fish at a sidewalk table. It was a bit pricey, but the food was good. For quieter outdoor dining, try Side Street in the French Quarter.",
    "The courthouse is quite old and features impressive artwork. The spiral staircase is amusing. From the 5th level, you can get a view of the entire city. The tower clock room is fascinating, filled with intricate mechanical gears. You need to schedule an appointment in advance to enter the clock room. It's worth spending 2 to 3 hours here.",
    "I got to meet Ann today, and she was super helpful and upbeat. She went above and beyond to make my first experience here amazing. I'm definitely going to be a regular customer now. Thanks, girlie!!",
    "Absolutely! Here’s a more enthusiastic version of your text:\n\nI tried this place for the first time and WOW, was I blown away! I ordered a combination dinner with Pad Thai and coconut soup, and let me tell you, it was amazing! The coconut soup was mouthwateringly delicious—I've never had anything like it before. The Pad Thai was on point, exactly what I was hoping for, and it didn't disappoint at all. The restaurant's Thai decor and music were incredible, creating the perfect ambiance. The staff and service were absolutely top-notch. In a town with limited food options, this spot is a breath of fresh air. I think I’ve found my new favorite go-to place in Carp!",
    "This place was an absolute oasis of relaxation and cool vibes. It's a must-return destination on my travel list. Plus, the artist's performance was a delightful and eclectic mix—imagine a country twist on \"Let It Go\"! How could you not fall in love with that?",
    "If you haven't been to the Smoothie King Center since it was known as the New Orleans Arena, you're in for a delightful surprise. The arena has undergone a fantastic facelift! While the seats remain the same, everything else has been revitalized. \n\nMost excitingly, the food options are now incredibly diverse, catering to a variety of tastes. The quality has skyrocketed compared to previous years. And let's talk about the drinks – they've also seen a major upgrade. From full-service bars to spiked lemonades, bottled and draft beers, and of course, smoothies, there's something for everyone. \n\nGot a sweet tooth? You're in luck. There's a spot for sweets where you can indulge in funnel cake, cotton candy, and countless other delectable treats that I was too full to even try. \n\nThe venue now exudes a swanky, top-notch vibe. It's clear that we're moving on up!",
    "Whenever my stomach feels unsettled, I know I can rely on Chipotle's steak to make me feel better. I try to avoid the busy lunch rush and usually visit between 2 and 4 when it's more peaceful. No matter the time, the service is always friendly and fast!",
    "I wasn't expecting much, but this place blew us away. It's one of the best Indian restaurants in Tampa Bay. The ambience with white table linens is wonderful, but the food is the standout. The chicken 65 was incredible, and the hot sour soup was rich and flavorful. Our waitress, Angel, was friendly and attentive. Despite opening just a week ago, this spot is sure to become a foodie favorite for authentic Indian cuisine.",
    "It took me three visits to New Orleans before I finally managed to get in. The first two times, I attempted to wait in line, but this time we smartened up and purchased reserved seats to secure spots on the benches. Spending an extra $20 was totally worth it to avoid standing in line for an hour. Plus, the funds support the preservation of Jazz, so it's for a good cause—definitely worth the splurge. The performance was phenomenal, showcasing true musicians with fantastic personalities. I can only imagine that this resembles concerts from 50 years ago. The band members were stylish, engaging, and incredibly talented. The venue is a small, intimate space that accommodates about 200 people, allowing you to see the joy on the musicians' faces as they share their art. This experience is a must when visiting New Orleans!",
    "Awesome experience! I was a first-time customer and didn't have an appointment because my other plans got rained out, and my dealership was too busy. I needed a PA State & Emissions inspection, which I usually dread since some places can totally rip you off. I really wanted to just get it done. I noticed this place had way better reviews on Yelp compared to other shops nearby.\n\nKeystone Discount Tire took my 2008 Pontiac Torrent in for inspection while I waited and sipped on some free coffee. I only had to get up once to check out some irregular outer front tire wear on my car when it was on the rack. I love it when the technician lets me see the issue for myself. It was nothing major, just needed an alignment later on. Bill was super friendly, knowledgeable, and gave me a straightforward rundown of my car's condition.\n\nMy car was fully inspected and stickered in less than an hour, and they didn’t jack up my bill with extra charges. I definitely recommend getting on their mailing list for some great coupons!",
    "Wow! I can hardly believe it—my son's phone is back in perfect shape after he dropped it! In less than half an hour, the experts worked their magic. The service was incredibly professional and outstanding! I'm absolutely thrilled!",
    "The service and management at the restaurant were abysmal. After completely bungling all four of our orders, the waiter became irate and started using profanities. In an attempt to make amends, the manager offered to waive the charges for our drinks. What a fiasco. The food was not only cold but also unappetizing, so much so that we couldn’t even finish half of it, despite having waited over an hour. Following this dreadful experience, I have decided never to dine at any Cracker Barrel location again.",
    "I've stayed at several dog-friendly hotels, but never in the city, so I wasn't sure what to expect. Typically, they're more like motels. This one, however, was right in the city center. I walked cautiously into the hotel lobby with my Labrador/Golden Retriever mix, who is quite noticeable. As we reached the front desk to check in, I still felt uneasy despite my boyfriend's assurance that this was a dog-friendly hotel. The reception staff were so friendly, immediately putting us at ease. While we checked in, an attendant asked if Bentley could have some treats, which she thoroughly enjoyed. The receptionist also inquired if we would like a welcome kit for Bentley. Amazing! It included dog dishes, a mat, treats, and more. I was blown away. Additionally, other guests complimented and petted \"Queen Bentley.\" Our room was on the top floor, which was fantastic. Even when I took her for a walk, the car attendants greeted her by name. We were so impressed with the service that we decided to extend our stay by an extra night. Thank you, Loews. I had no idea a hotel could be so accommodating to a large dog.",
    "Sometimes the food here is exceptional, but it's inconsistent. I've been ordering the same dish for years, and half the time, it's amazing. It feels like different chefs are in the kitchen, so you never know what you're going to get. It's a 50/50 chance of being excellent. Ugh.",
    "I've been to this place twice and won’t be going back. The first visit was just okay, but the second time was super disappointing. I ordered some ribs and had to send them back because one half was warm and the other half was fridge cold. They came back really hot on one side and still cold on the other. The third time they were finally edible. The manager came over the third time to apologize but didn’t offer to comp anything. I’m not one to make a fuss just to get free stuff, but having to send something back three times and only getting a half-hearted apology really annoyed me. Hence, this review!",
    "After trying several ramen places with lots of options and excellent broth, I was disappointed with the ramen at Cheu. Personally, I didn't like their thick noodles and very salty broth. However, the service was great, and they had a good selection of beers. My friend, who has been many times, loved it. I wish I liked it more, but I encourage others to try it for themselves. Maybe it's just not for me.",
    "Federal Doughnuts is the exciting new addition to the ballpark—a dream come true for fans craving delectable doughnuts and crispy fried chicken! And that's not all; near section 136, there's a brand-new, dedicated gluten-free concession stand. Treat yourself to their mouthwatering pizza, savory cheesesteaks, and indulge in their delightful brownies and cookies.",
    "It appears there is now a second Red Kings restaurant in Chinatown, and it certainly lived up to expectations! This new location just opened yesterday, so it's unclear if it will replace the original Red Kings down the street or if it simply adds to the abundance of spicy Szechuan cuisine in the area. We opted for takeout and chose the Dan Dan Noodles and a shredded pork in garlic sauce dish. Both dishes had the perfect spice level—intensely spicy, yet bursting with sweet, earthy, and fresh flavors. The portions were quite generous, ensuring we have plenty of leftovers. I'm eagerly anticipating trying more dishes and looking forward to dining in for a sit-down dinner. Additionally, they offer karaoke rooms upstairs and have a BYOB policy.",
    "This is one of the busiest Chick-fil-A locations I've seen, yet they always provide quick and exceptional service. I don't know how they do it, but they're consistently great! It's one of my favorite places!",
    "Great spot for salads! I visit every time I'm in town for lunch. It's quick, and the veggies are always fresh.",
    "On September 26th, 2015, my parents and I went on a tour of Oak Alley and Laura Plantations. Although I can't recall our driver's name, he provided us with a wealth of information during our journey to the plantations. The schedule was perfectly arranged, allowing us plenty of free time before and after the tours to explore the grounds. The return trip was also quite flexible with drop-off points. We chose to get off near Jackson Square, which gave us the opportunity to spend the rest of the afternoon enjoying the French Quarter.",
    "We've visited this place twice for brunch and had quite a pleasant experience both times. The food we've sampled has been delightful, especially the grits with scallions and sour cream. However, the room tends to be uncomfortably cold, so don't forget to bring a sweater!",
    "I absolutely love this place! They have the best hot dogs and chili dogs around. I make a point to go as often as I can. Yum!",
    "Waterline is an exceptional venue. I visited with friends for live music on Saturday and was thoroughly impressed. The ambiance is remarkable. The establishment offers the best local beer in the region, surpassing the offerings from Fig Mountain. I certainly prefer Waterline over Topa. Additionally, you can conveniently order outstanding cuisine from the Nook Restaurant and easily step into Lama Dog, which is a part of the Waterline complex. It was an outstanding experience.",
    "Excellent customer service! Even though we were slightly outside their pick-up range, they were very flexible and came to collect our group of 7. Upon arrival, we discovered we were charged for 8 instead of 7. A quick phone call later, and the extra ticket refund was processed in minutes! The tour itself was incredibly enjoyable! We spent the entire time laughing and smiling, and our tour guide was hilarious! We spotted numerous alligators, ranging from baby alligators swimming in the water to fully grown ones! We also saw turtles and birds! Our tour guide had a young alligator we could hold that he was caring for until it grew larger, as it was a late hatchling that wouldn't have survived otherwise. The return trip was also exciting as we sped along and the guide performed some \"tricks\" with the boat! I highly recommend this tour!!!",
    "Westfall transformed our roof this April, and the entire experience was outstanding. From top-notch quality and clear communication to diligent follow-up, we couldn’t be happier. We’re thrilled we chose this company for our roof replacement.",
    "Delicious food at fair prices and friendly staff. While it's not the best spot for dining in, it fits well with their fast-food take on vegan cuisine. Although the Buffalo Bella gets a lot of attention, I highly recommend the Cheesesteak. Also, don't miss out on the sweet potato fries—absolute must-try!",
    "The ramen is pretty good! Nothing mind-blowing, but definitely enjoyable. The service is decent too. It's a solid spot for a quick bite, though I might explore other options if they’re available. I’ve been here twice and plan to keep coming back!",
    "A menu that satisfies everyone's cravings—clean, trendy, and delicious! I recommend going early, before 9 am, because the wait gets longer after that. But honestly, it's so worth it. You'll leave feeling incredibly satisfied!",
    "I had the brisket sandwich with two sides and a drink for $9.99. It's great barbecue at an affordable price. The sides, such as potato casserole, creamed spinach, baked beans, and green beans, were wonderful.",
    "The food and service were absolutely incredible! My only wish is for more vegetarian and vegan options. I can't wait to return!",
    "The food is fantastic, but the customer service leaves much to be desired. I have visited three times and encountered two different older waitresses who were very unpleasant. However, the owner is delightful.",
    "A Franklin local I met on the flight mentioned this spot, urging us to endure the queue for one of Nashville's premier breakfast venues. HE WAS ABSOLUTELY SPOT ON. We were blown away by how fantastic it was, and luck favored us with no wait! According to our waitress, we managed to avoid the busy period. I savored a wonderfully flavorful corn pancake topped with bacon, salsa, and sour cream. Absolutely delicious. Every time I return to the South, this place is a must-visit~~~",
    "OMG!!! I can't believe this service exists! My husband scheduled a full detailing with Michael for next Saturday and confirmed on Friday, but Michael didn't know we wanted full detailing. He advised us to come the following Saturday instead. We arrived at 8am the next week, but the workshop was closed. Michael said he was busy and would call back, but didn't. We waited, went for breakfast, and returned at 9:30am. Alex, his partner, opened the shop at 9:30am, but still no Michael. Alex couldn't reach him. We gave up! Horrendous experience!",
    "During my move, I encountered several challenges and needed extra services from this office. The team here is exceptional and highly trustworthy. While I could elaborate on how well they took care of me, I'm concerned they might have gone beyond their usual duties. I would confidently recommend this office to my own mother!",
    "Last year, we stayed at The Saint for a girl's trip. The lobby is lovely with a cool bar and restaurant that impressed us immediately. The ambiance was just right—charming and welcoming. I checked in a few hours before my friend and spent the time working in my room. Later, I stepped out for errands and returned when she arrived.\n\nOur excitement quickly fizzled when we spotted a huge flying roach in our room. Disturbed, I went straight to the front desk. They offered to send maintenance, but that wasn’t adequate for me. They moved us to another room, but it too had issues: small spiders, dead bugs, a malfunctioning TV, and a lamp without bulbs. By 3 AM, I had decided we couldn’t stay. I booked us into The W for the rest of the trip.\n\nAt 8 AM, there was still no manager, so I demanded a refund in person. A young gentleman apologized and promptly refunded our money, asking me to consider returning after improvements. Despite his politeness, I declined.",
    "Let's say you need a new door, but you only have $35. Where do you go? The Green Project. Or, if you have leftover building supplies like bits of lumber, roofing materials, or paint, where can you take them so they don't end up in a landfill? The Green Project.",
    "This is the worst place I've ever visited. The bouncer was unnecessarily rude. They seem to think that just because they're on Broadway, they can mistreat customers and overcharge. As a local, I will never visit or recommend this place.",
    "Dropped in for lunch with my girlfriend. The place was spotless, the food was amazing, and the prices were great! Can't wait to return!",
    "It is truly disheartening to witness the decline in quality at this establishment, where I have been a patron for years. The deterioration in the standard of food is quite evident. \n\nFirst, we shared an artichoke to start, which was evidently prepared in advance. It was cold on the inside despite the flesh being fully cooked. \n\nSecondly, my wife ordered a Greek salad that appeared to consist entirely of pre-packaged ingredients and was excessively dressed with a bland dressing. \n\nLastly, I had the grilled yellowtail, which was unfortunately overcooked and of poor quality—seemingly an inferior, frozen piece of fish. This is simply unacceptable for Santa Barbara and I could not even finish it.\n\nIn summary, despite the excellent setting and good service, the subpar food makes a visit here hardly worth it. The establishment must significantly improve the quality of its food, or it risks becoming just another lower State Street dive for tourists.",
    "Milktooth is the ultimate spot for a delicious breakfast cocktail and a unique take on brunch. The menu might surprise you with its creative dishes, but I promise, whatever you choose will be fantastic. As one of the most popular brunch places in Indy, expect a typical 30-minute wait on weekends—it's totally worth it.\n\nTo make the wait pleasant, grab a coffee and pastry from their walk-up bar for a little preview of what's to come. Their menu changes occasionally, but certain favorites stick around with fresh twists. I can't get enough of their Dutch pancakes and their amazing raclette grilled cheese.\n\nIf you're in the mood for a boozy breakfast, don't miss out on the michelada. And if the weather's nice, definitely opt for outdoor seating!",
    "The bar and staff were AMAZING. We received a room upgrade since we were on our honeymoon, and the view was gorgeous. However, the room itself was comparable to a Hilton, with rust on the tub floor and some strange stains on the tiles. These issues were only in the bathroom, so I still give it 4 stars. The staff were great, though the valet service was overpriced, so we parked a few streets away. That's the only downside I'd mention. I would recommend this place if you want to stay right in the busy downtown area of St. Louis. There are lots of cool bars and restaurants to enjoy on a Friday night.",
    "I loved the beginner class; it was perfectly paced and stretched me in new ways. The studio is clean, and I like that Beyond Organic food items are available.",
    "It's surprising that we only just discovered this place. Initially, we planned to dine at a chain lobster restaurant but sought a more genuine experience. A friend suggested Lobster Haven, and after checking it out online, it seemed reminiscent of places we visit in Massachusetts. We were thoroughly pleased! The service was excellent—quick and very friendly. There is a vast selection of all the beloved seafood dishes. If you're looking for authentic New England seafood, you must visit this place. Additionally, you can buy live lobsters and fresh seafood to take home and cook yourself.",
    "Absolutely! \"Fabulous! Experience the best happy hour and indulge in a fresh menu with delish drinks. If I had the time, I'd be here every day!\"",
    "Men's Clubs is fantastic, no doubt about it. All the barbers are talented enough to give you a great haircut. I've been a regular for 3 years and have never had any issues — well, except once when someone tried to copy my hairstyle. But Tim was honest and said, \"I can't give you the same cut as Ryan.\" Thanks, Tim.",
    "My husband and I visit frequently. We adore the food as it's consistently fresh, and the service is excellent. We highly recommend this spot for sushi and hibachi enthusiasts.",
    "Chickie's and Pete's is the ultimate spot to catch a game and indulge in some delicious eats. While it might not be the finest dining experience, if you manage to snag a seat and enjoy a beer with some mussels red and crab fries, you're guaranteed to have a great time, whether it's game day or any day near the stadiums. My top picks include the crab fries, mussels red (I find the white version too garlicky sometimes), spicy pull and peel shrimp, steamers, and occasionally the blue crabs if I'm up for the effort—they're worth it. This place makes it easy to dig into your food with plenty of sinks around to wash up afterward—nice touch. In summary, Chickie's and Pete's is a Philly classic and always a blast. I highly recommend experiencing it at least once. Just keep in mind two things during major sporting events: 1. Finding a table can be nearly impossible and 2. You'll encounter lots of inebriated fans. I've been one myself, and we can be a bit much unless you're in the right mindset. :)",
    "Quick and professional service, even on a Saturday. Fixed my mirror easily. I've used them before in Charlotte, and they were great then as well.",
    "Great pick with Union Station in St. Louis! I dove into the Ponchartrain (which our server mentioned is just another name for Tilapia—though it's also listed separately on the menu, which is a bit confusing!). The Ponchartrain, paired with mushrooms and a rich cream sauce, was delightful. We also sampled the shrimp cocktail and lump crab cake appetizers; they were decent, but nothing to write home about. The drinks were on point, and the service was up to par. We opted for the patio seating to enjoy the pleasant weather, but the indoor ambiance looked cozy and a touch more formal.",
    "Yesterday, I decided to drop by for a drink and was thoroughly impressed by the atmosphere—it’s an easy A+ in my book. This spot brings a refreshingly unique vibe to the St. Pete area. The meticulous remodeling work done here is phenomenal; it feels like stepping into a scene straight out of a Harry Potter movie. The background music is at just the right volume, allowing for clear conversation without having to shout, perfectly complementing the old library-like setting. Michael and Peggy were bartending and they were incredibly friendly and engaging, making for great conversation. Since I had already eaten, I didn't try the food, but the menu looks promising with notably reasonable prices for meat and cheese trays compared to other local options. I’m definitely planning a return visit to sample the food and would highly recommend this place to anyone.",
    "Absolutely! I love Maple Street Patisserie; it's fantastic! I've always been thrilled with everything here. They make the best blueberry muffin I've ever tasted. It's a wonderful spot for both breakfast and lunch. They also offer specialty cakes, so be sure to visit during Mardi Gras to pick up a king cake. The owner, Ziggy, is incredible. He's always hustling and working long hours to create these delicious treats. This place is unbeatable!",
    "Great burger! I had the Bourbon Black and Bleu, and it was cooked perfectly and tasted awesome. I only gave 3 stars because of the wait. We had a big group—4 adults and 5 kids—and it took over an hour to get our food. It really shouldn’t have taken that long, no matter how many of us there were.",
    "Every time we have out-of-town guests, we love taking them to Katie's. The food selection is incredible and always beautifully prepared—nothing else compares. The prices are reasonable, and the food is delicious; Katie's never lets us down. Whether you're in the mood for grilled oysters, shrimp and grits, a Cuban sandwich, pizza, or soup and salad, you're guaranteed a great meal. They also offer daily specials featuring local, seasonal ingredients to keep things exciting. The staff is warm and friendly, making the experience even better. If you plan on going on a Sunday, try to get there before church lets out to avoid a wait. But even if you do have to wait, you can enjoy bottomless Mimosas while you do!",
    "After attending the Zurich Classic golf tournament, I was craving something refreshing because it was warm and a bit humid. What could be tastier than an ice cream cone? Luckily, I found a parking space on the street. The interior of the place was cute and comfortable. They had a huge selection of flavors, and after sampling a couple of unusual ones, I chose a scoop of Cookie Monster ice cream on a cone. The ice cream was perfect—not overly sweet. Creole Creamery is definitely worth checking out!",
    "I LOVE this place! I've been coming here for years. It's quirky, and while I wouldn't risk the escargot, the Saki, great rolls, and heaps of rice and Sashimi are top-notch. The young atmosphere, loud dance music, and plenty of Saki make it a must-visit!",
    "We have enjoyed everything we've tried here, with the Backyard Bowl being our favorite so far, though there are many more we still want to sample. My husband and I find that a kids size each or sharing a large portion fills us up completely. The ingredients are of high quality and quite filling, and the price is very reasonable considering this. Although it can get quite busy, it's worth the wait.",
    "The service was alright, though a bit unconventional since the staff member was new. The food presentation was appealing, but they should consider adding rice or more potato salad to the gumbo. The Sprite was flat, but I didn't really need it.",
    "This pancake place is awesome! The pancakes are so deliciously sweet and satisfying, perfect for anyone with a sweet tooth. The fact that they serve breakfast all day is an absolute win! The prices are just right, making it a great spot to enjoy a fantastic meal without breaking the bank. Sure, it gets a bit hectic during busy times, but that’s just part of the lively atmosphere. It may not be the only place to get breakfast, but it’s definitely worth checking out!",
    "Fantastic discoveries and an amazing team! We absolutely love our purchases and will definitely return!!!",
    "We've been coming here since I was a kid, and it's amazing how the staff has watched me grow up and now gets to see my kids grow up too! Everyone here is so personable and nice. The service is always prompt, and Yoli and Frank are the absolute best! The food is amazing, and I can't get enough of their shredded beef burro and cheese crisp. They really deliver authentic Mexican flavors!",
    "Dine-in experience receives 2 stars. Service was disappointing and the venue didn't meet expectations. The food was acceptable, so for takeout, this place might earn 3 stars. I ordered the lamb kebab, which tasted alright but was very plain—just meat with no sauces, lettuce, or any accompaniments.",
    "This is the best Middle Eastern restaurant around! The food is always great and makes my tummy happy!",
    "I can't believe anyone would give this place just one star. Here's the truth: they have the BEST cannoli in the city. Termini's doesn't even come close, and Isgro's is overly hyped and underwhelming. Potito's is my go-to for cannoli—I wouldn't even think of going anywhere else. I'm there every Christmas Eve and will be for the rest of my life. This year, I stood in line at Isgro's for TWO HOURS for a tiramisu, but I walked right into Potito's and got my bambino cannoli-stuffed cannoli. It's as amazing as it sounds—trust me.",
    "I can't praise this tiny, authentic, and perfectly delicious eatery enough! Having grown up in the Texas panhandle with plenty of authentic Mexican food, I'm always on the lookout for good Mexican restaurants. El Limon is the best I've found in Pennsylvania! Their sopes, tostadas, enchiladas, fajitas, burritos, and fish tacos are all excellent and very reasonably priced. The waitstaff is consistently pleasant and attentive. The standout features: homemade tamales and free margaritas! Bring the whole family for an amazing Mexican feast! Olé!",
    "I'm giving this joint 4 stars, but trust me—they're on the cusp of being a full-fledged 5-star sensation! They've just opened, so a few hiccups are to be expected, and they are more than willing to make corrections and accommodations when needed. But let's talk about the food—it's REALLY good!\n\nUnlike some other reviewers, I don't think their pizza is their strong suit. It's a bit greasy and the cheese doesn't taste like it's 100% mozzarella. But don't let that deter you because here's what I've tried, and it's amazing:\n\n- The Quaker (Chicken version): Absolutely delicious! They use chunky chicken steaks instead of shredded, which I prefer. The chicken could use a tad more seasoning, but the cheese was perfectly melted, and the veggies were incredibly fresh.\n\n- The fries: Crisp and full of flavor! I didn't even need ketchup, and that's saying something.\n\n- The onion rings: A bit greasy but still very tasty and crispy. The onions stayed in the breading, which I love.\n\n- Spanakopita: Mine was a little overcooked, but the flavors were spot on.\n\n- Baklava: VERY GOOD!\n\n- Signature Salad: Super fresh veggies and an excellent balsamic dressing. A total win!\n\n- The (turkey) Greek Burger: One of the best turkey burgers I've ever had! The patty was moist and flavorful, and topped with what must be homemade tzatziki. I could eat a bowl of that stuff! They used romaine instead of arugula, but it was so fresh that I didn't mind. I also asked for feta and didn't get it, but the sauce made me forget all about it.\n\nOverall, this place is fantastic! If they maintain their high-quality standards, I'll keep coming back for more!",
    "Planet Fitness earns a gleaming four stars primarily for its unbeatable 24-hour access. If affordability is your priority, you'll find it offers the best value for your money. While you may not spot many bodybuilders there, the crowd generally consists of larger individuals—something I can relate to from my past. The gym features a tanning bed, massage chairs, and a sculpt machine, all for just $20.00 a month. Opt for the $9.99 plan if you're fine without the extras and don't mind flying solo. The staff? Unfailingly polite and helpful, making each visit pleasant.",
    "I was very disappointed. We went to eat at 2:15 on Saturday, only to be told the kitchen had closed at 2. Their website indicates they serve all day on Saturdays and Sundays, and it also states they are open until 5. When a place cannot manage simple details like updating their hours on the website, it makes me question their attention to quality and other \"small\" things.",
    "They deliver quality work promptly and offer a warranty. I highly recommend them!",
    "I dine here at least twice a week. The servers are consistently friendly, and the food is incredible. I always leave satisfied and with a full stomach.",
    "What a delightful discovery! This establishment is the transformed Carrow's Restaurant on Plumb and Kietzke, saved from demolition by its stunning redwood beams and fascia. The food was fantastic. My wife enjoyed the tri-tip salad, featuring greens on one side with a balsamic vinaigrette, balanced by four generous slices of medium-rare tri-tip and crunchy potato \"croutons\" – little heavenly bits of crispy potatoes. I opted for the tri-tip and chicken combo, accompanied by a fresh corn salad and potato salad. It was so delectable that we decided to order dessert, which is a rare treat for me. The dessert options included lemon meringue, mud pie, apple pie, and ice cream. We shared the lemon meringue, and it was superb, with real meringue perfectly set and browned. The prices were very reasonable given the quality of the food and the overall experience. We've already recommended this gem to our local family and friends and look forward to returning soon. Well done!",
    "Rebecca didn't help with my birth as a Doula, but she was our nanny for our first daughter. Over the months she spent in our home, I found myself looking forward to chatting with her before and after work. I was heavily pregnant with Baby #2, and her advice was very helpful to me as an expecting mom. She was always approachable, honest, and truthful, which I really appreciated. She loves being a Doula and finds beauty and strength in that special role. Rebecca would be a great addition to your support team!",
    "I recently had my car tinted at Orange Tint and Tune and received excellent service. They offer a convenient car pick-up service if you live within 4 miles of their shop. Carlos, the technician, explained all the tint options and adjusted the tint to match the look I wanted. This level of customer care deserves 5 stars. The receptionist was very friendly, and the owner, Dustin, even followed up to check on my experience.",
    "I stayed here for three nights on a business trip. The property is very close to the airport, but you can't really hear any noise from it. The rooms are the typical TownePlace Suites setup, complete with a refrigerator, stove, and other amenities. The hotel is in a quiet area, surrounded by other hotels and office buildings. It's about a 20-minute drive to downtown or the university, and just 5-10 minutes from the Pima Air Museum. There aren’t many restaurants nearby, but there are a few fast food restaurants and a great sandwich place called Baggins within walking distance. The hotel staff is very friendly and helpful. They offer a standard continental breakfast with a couple of hot options and have a reception on weekday evenings. My only complaint is that the food and drinks at the reception run out quickly, so it's best to go early. I arrived 45 minutes after it started and found there was still food left but very few soft drinks, and no diet options. It would be better if they restocked the area throughout the event. Overall, the rooms are nice, the beds are comfortable, and the area feels safe.",
    "Our journey took an unexpected turn to Tampa, so we opted to drive to Orlando. First, though, we needed a place to eat. Eager to avoid chain restaurants, Yelp led us to this charming local spot! The ladies ordered the 7 oz. Tampa strip, while the gents went for the 14 oz. ribeye. They grill their steaks over oak and citrus wood, giving them an incredible smoky flavor that's simply irresistible! As enthusiasts of wood-smoked steaks ourselves, we were thrilled to find a restaurant that shares our love for this cooking method. The sides consisted of vegetables and sweet potatoes. \n\nThe wine selection was impressively priced, with most bottles under $20—what a refreshing change from the usual high markups! Our waitress, Lisa, offered fantastic recommendations and provided excellent, friendly service. We're so happy we chose a local restaurant over a chain. We will certainly mark this spot for a return visit next time we're in Tampa!",
    "After my previous review, the owner of this location (and two others, including Southampton) reached out to me. We talked for half an hour, and I was very impressed with his business approach. He's definitely someone I want to do business with. I returned to Saladworks twice, and the service had vastly improved. The new summer salads are wonderful!",
    "The best deli I've visited in the US! So many choices make it hard to pick. The Muffalata feeds four and is delicious. Visit on Saturday or Thursday night for live music. The special is a great choice, with plenty of sides like chili, potato salad, and chips. Go now!",
    "My dad and I are on a cross-country trip, and one of our first stops was Saguaro National Park. We took a quick tour with Park Ranger Carolyn and loved it. She was incredibly enthusiastic, passionate about her studies on the saguaro, and very knowledgeable. We definitely recommend both the tour and Carolyn.",
    "I came here after my husband brought home their amazing lemon pepper wings. They have so many flavors to choose from! You'll find classics like lemon pepper and mild, as well as unique New Orleans flavors like yaka mein and noonie bird. Their drinks are also fantastic – the watermelon drink is absolutely to die for. I'm not sure what their secret ingredient is, but it's incredible! The location isn't the greatest, but they're making an effort to give back to the community. It's close to the daiquiri shop, so it's quite safe during the day. I might avoid coming alone at night, though. Definitely give this place a try. Who knows, you might even bump into Skip!",
    "Returning to Tom Jones, it's time to refresh my review. I noticed that the peculiar ATM-like machine which only allowed you to withdraw money for your check is no longer present. It used to be located near the restrooms. However, there's still a payphone back there which I really appreciate. Now, there are ATMs near the front entrance.\n\nThe blue ribbon special is now priced at $3.79, but it's still a great deal because it includes everything: pancakes, two eggs, toast, sausage, bacon, juice, and coffee. I dined here with my kids, as it was my daughter’s pick. She says she \"loves Tom Jones.\" Our meal selections included blue ribbons, French toast, chicken, a club sandwich, and a baked potato. Everyone was able to get what they liked.\n\nI didn’t notice any stale smoke odor and wouldn’t describe the place as dirty. I like the \"loud\" orange booths; they give a nostalgic feel along with the payphone. The service is consistently fast, and I always seem to have a different waitress. Not sure where they find these young ladies, but they all do a great job. I’ve seen different managers there, and they are all efficient and proactive–traits of good managers.\n\nSince it's my daughter’s favorite place, I’m increasing my rating from 4 to 5 stars.",
    "As an amateur athlete, I first met Dr. Ferrel while playing softball. He treated my severe injury on the field and asked me to visit his office for further treatment. Initially, I declined due to financial constraints as a single mom on a teacher's salary. Another physician estimated months for recovery, but feeling hopeless, I reached out to Dr. Ferrel again. He treated and healed me within weeks. Over the years, Dr. Ferrel has consistently achieved amazing results. He will always be my hero.",
    "Their shows are always a blast! You'll find an entertaining and relaxed atmosphere that's perfect for a great night out. Delicious food, good times, and fair prices make this the go-to spot for an unforgettable experience.",
    "I love In-N-Out. Sometimes, you just crave it. Four patties, animal style!",
    "Cindy's is truly exceptional! The food and service are outstanding, offering an authentic culinary experience that stands out. Every dish is freshly prepared, and you can immediately taste the difference compared to other Mexican restaurants. I highly recommend Cindy's to anyone who loves Mexican cuisine.",
    "I've been wanting to try Trust Me BBQ for over a year now. I stopped by about three months ago but left after waiting ten minutes without any service. After reading some reviews, I decided to give it another shot just to see what the buzz was about. Honestly, the food was hit or miss, but the service was terrible, so I doubt I'll go back. The guy behind the counter didn't speak, smile, or engage with us at all—it felt like dealing with a vending machine. When we finally ordered, he didn't pay attention and gave us the wrong sides. We had to correct him as he was serving. \n\nIn the end, I'll stick with Down to the Bone BBQ. \n\nPros: The BBQ sauce is delicious, the macaroni salad was unique and interesting, and the \"pulled\" pork was nice and moist.\nCons: The chicken was drier than a sheet of paper, completely inedible even with BBQ sauce. The mac & cheese seemed like it had been sitting on the steam table for days, and the collard greens were barely flavored.",
    "While I was in town for a week, I stumbled upon this little hole in the wall. The pa nang chicken was excellent; I ordered it with one-star spice level and it arrived quickly. I'll definitely be coming back.",
    "Cinco de Mayo just wouldn't be complete without margaritas, sangria, and all things fried! This fantastic spot masterfully blends flavors from diverse ethnicities to create truly unique recipes. While it may not be labeled as a traditional \"Mexican\" eatery, they excel at crafting the perfect tequila-infused drinks and rocking that rock salt. Plus, they've recently launched a wine bar just a few doors down, offering overflow seating and exclusive bottles. Their on-the-rocks margaritas and house-made white or red sangria are absolute must-tries—definitely worth the visit!",
    "This charming donut bakery, nestled in one of Hermitage's oldest shopping centers, goes beyond expectations. Baking fresh donuts daily is no simple task; it requires starting in the early morning hours. Yeu, the dedicated owner, offers not only the classic donuts but also unique creations like bacon-topped donuts, apple fritters, pigs in a blanket, breakfast pastries, and kolaches. The standout treat? The doughssant—a divine fusion of a donut and a croissant. These delights alone make the visit worthwhile. Prices are incredibly affordable: doughssants at $1.99 each and regular donuts at just $0.60 each. These delicious treats are a hit with my kid's school teachers. And don't forget, they serve coffee too!",
    "We've had a fantastic time at every event we've attended. We've enjoyed concerts, basketball games, and other activities that were a lot of fun. The food has been excellent, with many local favorites on offer.",
    "The food at this restaurant is excellent. We sampled three appetizers and five entrées, and each was a delightful experience. The menu offers reasonable prices, and the service is attentive and efficient. I am eager to return multiple times.",
    "The quality of service at this establishment has declined. We were frequent patrons, but we have since chosen to visit another location. The service has become notably slow and sometimes neglectful.",
    "This was by far the worst chicken and rice plate I've ever had. Despite being assured there was no sauce on the chicken to keep it healthy, the dish was drenched in oil. By the time I reached my car, oil had spilled out of the container and soaked the bag. There must have been at least 5-7 tablespoons of oil on the plate. This is not what I was promised, and certainly not what anyone would want to eat. It's ironic that their slogan includes the word \"healthy.\" What a joke.",
    "I recently purchased a washer and dryer for my new home, and though I wasn't expecting much based on the poor reviews, I was pleasantly surprised. The selection was impressive, and the salespeople were clearly well-versed in their products, making the process easier than anticipated. The timely delivery also exceeded my low expectations. \n\nDespite being skeptical, I felt the staff genuinely tried to offer me the most competitive pricing and guided me through several budget-friendly options. They even checked for additional discounts, which was a nice touch. I appreciated the honest feedback and thorough answers to all my questions. My experience at Sears defied the negative reviews, and I ended up quite satisfied. Given my experience, I'd suggest giving them a chance.",
    "The food here is fantastic. Service is quick, and the staff is incredibly friendly. I always feel welcome when I place my orders.",
    "I finally got to try them out. Wow, they did an awesome job with the remodel. I loved the mushroom cheesesteak!",
    "The espresso here is exceptional, making it my favorite spot for an Americano. The staff is courteous and friendly, and the atmosphere is relaxed. While there are no power outlets available, there is unlimited WiFi access. The bathrooms and the rest of the establishment are consistently clean.",
    "Prompted by the high ratings and enthusiastic recommendations, I decided to give this establishment a try, only to find the overall experience disappointingly lackluster from beginning to end. The website is scarcely useful for menu reconnaissance, necessitating an inconvenient navigation through three location choices and then scrolling to find minimalistic descriptions devoid of explanations or prices. The menu items are listed as follows: Roast Beef, Roast Beef Combo, Roast Pork, Roast Pork Combo, Baked Ham, Baked Ham Combo, Roast Turkey, Roast Turkey Combo, Broccoli Rabe, and Broccoli Rabe Combo. There is no clarification on what constitutes a \"combo\" (which, as I later discovered, merely entails the addition of cheese).\n\nUpon my arrival, the venue seemed more akin to a bar than a restaurant, although there were designated tables. Faced with indecision and considering the sandwiches were reasonably priced at $6.85, I opted for both the Roast Beef and Roast Pork combos. The sandwiches were served promptly; however, the roast beef was noticeably cold while the roast pork was hot. It is perplexing how the kitchen could allow such a glaring temperature disparity in simultaneously prepared items, clearly indicating one had been left sitting for some time.\n\nI requested the waitress to reheat the roast beef while I consumed the roast pork. Allegedly reheated, the roast beef emerged marginally warmer yet still far from satisfactory compared to the freshly finished roast pork. Although the waitress kindly offered to replace the sandwich, time constraints deterred me from accepting a replacement.\n\nThe sandwiches proved underwhelming in substance, skimpy on meat, and overly drenched in gravy to the detriment of the bread's integrity, resulting in a messy affair. The table place card, which provided more comprehensive descriptions than the website, mentioned a \"wet meat\" option with less gravy. I strongly advise opting for this alternative to prevent the gravy from overpowering both the meat's flavor and the sandwich's structural stability.",
    "I got takeout from Village Whiskey, so I can't comment on the restaurant itself. The Whiskey Burger is expensive at $26 but fantastic if you don't mind a greasier burger. It's very tender, the bacon is excellent, and it's quite sizable. If the price isn't an issue for you, I highly recommend it. The Duck Fat fries are also very rich and tasty.",
    "I spent $80 on food for the family, and it was absolutely worth every penny. The dishes we received were not only hot and delicious, but the orange chicken, in particular, was the best I've tasted in quite some time. As a result, this restaurant is now going to be our go-to place for Asian cuisine!",
    "I usually do my laundry at my boyfriend's house, but after having family staying over recently, I faced a mountain of towels, sheets, and comforters to wash. I needed a laundromat that was safe, clean, and free from sketchy vibes. When I found this facility, I was over the moon! It's spotless, brightly lit, and the staff couldn't be more friendly and helpful. I was blown away by how fast the washers and dryers were. I knocked out four massive loads (the equivalent of eight regular ones) in just under two hours! This place has everything: security cameras, flat-screen TVs, magazines, Wi-Fi, clean bathrooms, and vending machines. The atmosphere is fantastic for doing laundry. It wasn't crowded at all, with plenty of washers and dryers available. I'm thrilled I discovered this gem. Thank you, LAUNDROMAT!!!",
    "We went in for a late-night dinner yesterday. The prices are definitely on the higher side. Both couples opted to share a plate (which visibly annoyed our server), and while the food was good, it didn't justify the cost. However, the garlic bread served before the meal was absolutely amazing! I could have easily eaten a lot of it. Overall, I probably wouldn't choose to dine there again. It might have just been an off night, but with so much competition in the St. Louis food scene, there are better options.",
    "Dropped by to grab a burger during today's Seahawks/Saints game, and the place was understandably packed. And for good reason: the Haven burger I had was excellent. I sat right by the door, so I didn't get more than six feet inside. As soon as I got my meal, the crowd kept growing until I had to navigate through a maze of people to leave. Clearly, I wasn't the first to discover this spot. I'll definitely be returning to the Haven. Maybe for lunch on a Tuesday when it's less busy.",
    "I am only able to provide feedback on the vermicelli bowls, as I have not yet had the opportunity to try the Pho. The vermicelli portions are generous and offer good value for the price. The restaurant is conveniently situated for those residing in the Alberta Avenue area. Impressively, my orders have consistently been prepared within 15 minutes, even during the busy period of a Friday evening.",
    "I tried the Chicken Marsala that our waiter suggested. The chicken was super thin, tough, and dry. The pasta was undercooked and all clumped together. It had zero flavor. My friend got the lasagna and didn't like it either. There was only a thin layer of pasta, and it was bland. Another friend of mine had her plate taken away while she was in the restroom even though she told the waiter she wasn't done. They did give her a new meal to take home, though. On the bright side, the atmosphere was great with live music, and I had fun dancing with my husband. But honestly, the food was terrible, and it was pretty pricey.",
    "This place is fantastic! It has a nice atmosphere, is conveniently located near the Broad Street line, and has plenty of street parking. It's also BYOB. I've visited twice and loved every dish. My favorites were the chaats, beef short ribs, lamb vindaloo, beet salad, breads and pickles, and chai. We always get the chocolate cake to share, and everyone enjoys it. You can also get takeout beer from the corner bar. We will definitely return.",
    "I absolutely love this restaurant! I consistently go for their mouthwatering ceviche. The vibe is lively, and the staff is outstanding. Alex served us and was incredibly friendly, attentive, and considerate.",
    "Absolutely love this place! It's hard to find someone who wouldn't. With a fresh salad bar and a wide variety of ethnic foods to explore, there's so much to enjoy. N-JOY",
    "I ordered a Mediterranean chicken shawarma. It had great flavor, and they were generous with the amount of chicken in the pita. The food was ready when I got there, and the service was good. I'll definitely go back next time I'm around.",
    "Love this place! Great food, pleasant space and staff. Highly recommended for both vegetarians and non-vegetarians.",
    "Service was slow at first, but I was happy once it started. The gumbo was awesome and I loved the chicken & waffles. Friendly staff and a great spot on Bourbon St for people watching!",
    "For an airport grab-and-go restaurant, Earl offers a respectable variety of sandwich options such as turkey, tuna, and even a Hawaiian. Today, however, the enticing aroma of roast beef caught my attention, prompting me to choose that one. I wasn't disappointed. The sandwich featured a generous portion of sliced beef, cooked beyond medium, topped with cheddar cheese and a delicious horseradish sauce. Trust me, you don't need lettuce or tomatoes; it's perfect as it is. Conveniently located between the security station and the top of the D gates, near the Delta SkyClub, Earl makes it easy to grab a bite to eat at the gate or onboard. Yum.",
    "WOW! What an incredible spot! Food: A+, Service: A+++ We began with an appetizer of cheese curds paired with red pepper jelly. LOVED IT! I had the fish tacos, and my wife had a beer brat for dinner. We both thoroughly enjoyed our meals! The portions were generous and reasonably priced. Our server was excellent—very attentive, knowledgeable about the menu, and made us feel very welcome. The manager stopped by to check on us, and I mentioned that I might have found a new favorite place to hang out, have a beer, and watch football. He informed us about great game day deals and their weekend brunch. Everyone said goodbye as we left and reminded us to grab a root beer candy on our way out. I will definitely be back!",
    "I dropped by for dinner and a drink and left feeling completely satisfied! Normally, I avoid ordering burgers when dining out since they're so easy to make at home. However, this experience might just change that habit. The burger was so good that I'll struggle to order anything else next time. Plus, the beer selection didn't disappoint, and the friendly wait staff and bartenders made me feel right at home. My meal arrived just as I had asked and in no time at all. The restaurant's ambiance was pleasant, and the restrooms were spotless. Overall, it was a delightful visit!"
