    "Futures contracts are a member of a larger class of financial assets called derivatives. Derivatives are called such because their payoffs depend on the price of other assets (financial or real). Other kinds of derivatives are call options, put options. Fixed income assets that mimic the behavior of derivatives are callable bonds, puttable bonds etc.  A futures contract is a contract that specifies the following: Just like with any other contract, there are two parties involved. One party commits to delivering the underlying asset to the other party on expiration date in exchange for the futures price. The other party commits to paying the futures price in exchange for the asset. There is no price that any of the two parties pay upfront to engage in the contract. The language used is so that the agent committing to receiving the delivery of the underlying asset is said to have bought the contract. The agent that commits to make the delivery is said to have sold the contract.  So answer your question, buying on June 1 a futures contract at the futures price of $100, with a maturity date on August 1 means you commit to paying $100 for the underlying asset on August 1. You don't have to pay anything upfront. Futures price is simply what the contract prescribes the underlying asset will exchange hands for.",

    "\"At any given moment, one can tally the numbers used for NAV. It's math, and little more. The Market Cap, which as you understand is a result of share value. Share value (stock price) is what the market will pay today for the shares. It's not only based on NAV today, but on future expectations. And expectations aren't the same for each of us. Which is why there are always sellers for the buyers of a stock, and vice-versa.  From your question, we agree that NAV can be measured, it's the result of adding up things that are all known. (For now, let's ignore things such as \"\"goodwill.\"\") Rarely is a stock price simply equal to the NAV divided by the number of shares. Often, it's quite higher. The simplest way to look at it is that the stock price not only reflects the NAV, but investors' expectations looking into the future.  If you look for two companies with identical NAV per share but quite different share prices, you'll see that the companies differ in that one might be a high growth company, the other, a solid one but with a market that's not in such a growth mode.\"",
    "Chinese suppliers can quote their price in CNY rather than USD (as has been typical), and thus avoid the exchange risk from US dollar volatility- the CNY has been generally appreciating so committing to receive payments in US dollars when their costs are in CNY means they are typically on the losing end of the equation and they have to pad their prices a bit.  Canadian importers will have to buy RMB (typically with CAD) to pay for their orders and Canadian exporters can take payment in RMB if they wish, or set prices in CAD. By avoiding the US dollar middleman the transactions are made less risky and incur less costs. Japan did this many decades ago (they, too, used to price their products in USD).  This is important in transactions of large amounts, not so much for the tiny amounts associated with tourism. Two-way annual trade between China and Canada is in excess of $70bn.  Of course Forex trading may greatly exceed the actual amounts required for trade- the world Forex market is at least an order of magnitude greater than size of real international trade.

    "\"I read the post.  I read what **they said** about it.   Yet, that part makes **no sense**.  They keep talking about \"\"only avilable to members of the Florida Bar\"\" but stop and think about how that doesn't make sense.  Are they in a *florida* court or in a *federal* court?  Or an IP/administrative setting?    Some things they wrote suggests they're in a *federal* court.  But others things suggest they're in an administrative court related to IP.  For example, they talk about needing an attorney who can represent them in the Trademark/IP courts.  That sounds like patent prosecution - but that's typically just about getting the patent/IP stuff in the first place - and not so much after-the-fact stuff.  But then again, I'm not at all familiar with the area so I could be way off base.  The problem is: I shouldn't have to be speculating so much because their story sucked.  But patent litigation (for infringement for example) as far as I was aware, occurs in traditional district courts and so far as I am aware you don't need a special trademark/ip exam to sue on it.  By contrast, patent *prosecution*, which is getting a patent through the offices, requires that the attorney take the USPTO exam - to become a 'patent' attorney.  [link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USPTO_registration_examination).  Federal courts, if that's where they are, typically use PACER ECF/CM (case management web portal).

    "My super fund and I would say many other funds give you one free switch of strategies per year.  Some suggest you should change from high growth option to a more balance option once you are say about 10 to 15 years from retirement, and then change to a more capital guaranteed option a few years from retirement. This is a more passive approach and has benefits as well as disadvantages. The benefit is that there is not much work involved, you just change your investment option based on your life stage, 2 to 3 times during your lifetime. This allows you to take more risk when you are young to aim for higher returns, take a balanced approach with moderate risk and returns during the middle part of your working life, and take less risk with lower returns (above inflation) during the latter part of your working life. A possible disadvantage of this strategy is you may be in the higher risk/ higher growth option during a market correction and then change to a more balanced option just when the market starts to pick up again. So your funds will be hit with large losses whilst the market is in retreat and just when things look to be getting better you change to a more balanced portfolio and miss out on the big gains. A second more active approach would be to track the market and change investment option as the market changes. One approach which shouldn't take much time is to track the index such as the ASX200 (if you investment option is mainly invested in the Australian stock market) with a 200 day Simple Moving Average (SMA). The concept is that if the index crosses above the 200 day SMA the market is bullish and if it crosses below it is bearish. See the chart below:  This strategy will work well when the market is trending up or down but not very well when the market is going sideways, as you will be changing from aggressive to balanced and back too often. Possibly a more appropriate option would be a combination of the two. Use the first passive approach to change investment option from aggressive to balanced to capital guaranteed with your life stages, however use the second active approach to time the change. For example, if you were say in your late 40s now and were looking to change from aggressive to balanced in the near future, you could wait until the ASX200 crosses below the 200 day SMA before making the change. This way you could capture the majority of the uptrend (which could go on for years) before changing from the high growth/aggressive option to the balanced option. If you where after more control over your superannuation assets another option open to you is to start a SMSF, however I would recommend having at least $300K to $400K in assets before starting a SMSF, or else the annual costs would be too high as a percentage of your total super assets.",

    "First, to answer the question.  The benefit of a 401k is that you don't have to pay income tax on the money contributed nor do you pay capital gains tax on the money that accumulates.  You get that with the restriction that you can't willy nilly remove and contribute money to the account (and you are taxed on withdrawals, more severely if you do it before you are 65).  Similar sorts of restrictions apply to all retirement accounts which give tax benefits.  Now, for the 7000 not providing benefit.  Assuming a very modest 4% growth, over 40 years 7000 becomes 34,671. Not something to sneeze at (inflation, risk reward, blah, blah, blah, it is less than it looks, but 4% is really pretty low, the stock market averages anywhere from 7-&gt;10% and IIRC the bond market is somewhere around 5%).  Now, certainly, to avoid bankruptcy you should withdraw.  However, if it is possible, you will be best served by keeping the money in your 401k account.

    "The details of the 401(k) are critical to the decision. A high cost (the expenses charged within the) 401(k) - I would deposit only to the match, and I'd be sure to get the entire match offered. In which case, that $3000 might be good to have available if you start out with a tight budget.  Low cost 401(k) w/match - a no-brainer, deposit what you can afford.

    "\"Based on the conversations in the comments, I believe a pragmatic solution would be the best immediate course of action, while still working on the long term addiction issues. The first step is to get your husband to agree to give you all of his credit cards and let you manage the money for a set period of time, say 3 months, to see how it goes. (In my experience people are more likely to agree to being uncomfortable for a finite period of time, rather than indefinitely.) Step 2 is to provide him a means for making purchases on his own, but with a limited budget. Here are some examples: Perhaps a combination of the above options would work best. Another thing to consider is to set up alerts with your bank so that you are notified of certain purchases (or all) that are made by your husband. This varies by bank, but nowadays most will allow you to receive text/email immediately when the purchase happens, and can be set to certain amounts or categories. There is a definite psychological difference between, \"\"If I buy this, my spouse will find out at the end of the month and berate me.\"\" and \"\"If I buy this, my spouse is going to run in here in 30 seconds and berate me.\"\" The latter might actually be a deterrent on its own, and you may likely have the opportunity to undo the purchase if you wish to. As a side note, it's important to realize that the above suggestions are still allowing for some limited amount of enabling and temptation to occur. If the addiction is such that it is hazardous to one's health (for example drugs or alcohol addiction), then I don't believe this would be the best course of action. These suggestions are based on my impression that the biggest concern at the moment is financial, and I believe these ideas help to mitigate that. Good luck.\"",

    "So does a post-dated check have any valid use in a business or   personal transaction? Does it provide any financial or legal   protections at all? Yes, most definitely. You're writing a future date on the check, not past, to ensure that the check will not be deposited before that day. Keep in mind that this may change from place to place, since not every country has the same rules. In the US, for example, such trick would not work since the check may be presented any time and is not a limited obligation. However, in some other countries banks will not pay a check presented before the date written on it. While in the US the date on the check is the date on which it was (supposedly) written and as such is meaningless for obligation purposes, in many other countries the date on the check is the date on which the payment to be made, thus constitutes the start of the commitment and payment will not be made before that date. For example, in Canada: If you write a post-dated cheque, under the clearing rules of the   Canadian Payments Association (CPA), your cheque should not be cashed   before the date that is written on it. If the post-dated cheque is cashed early, you can ask your financial   institution to put the money back into your account up to the day   before the cheque should have been cashed.",

I'd have to log in to their site to find the cost of a \"\"bid\"\" for packages, but you can multiply the cost of a single \"\"bid\"\" by 2,118, add another £21.18, and you'll know what all \"\"bidders\"\" trying to receive this item paid - I'll bet the total is substantially more than £249.  People taking part in these scams obviously convince themselves that they are the \"\"clever\"\" ones who will get an item cheaply. Apart from the possibility that a single \"\"bidder\"\" can easily make more bids than the value of the item, if you think you are more clever than everyone else, you are kidding yourself. (If you think you are indeed more clever than everyone else, go ahead and donate your money to these companies).  The \"\"packages\"\" are most likely designed to give you the false impression that you get some value for money. Years ago when I checked a single bid was £1, but in bigger packages the bids would cost say 50 pence. They also want many bidders to make sure the number of bids will be high (although there is nothing other than the website's honesty that prevents them from automatically adding bids if an item would otherwise sell too cheap).  Just to clarify: These are not auction sites. In an auction, the highest bidder pays the price they bid, usually plus some commission (on eBay, the commission is paid by the seller), and gets the goods, while everyone else keeps their money. In this \"\"auction\"\", every bid costs money, and by increasing the bid by one penny each time they make sure there are usually thousands of bids. (They also offer the products at a \"\"reduced\"\" price if you don't \"\"win\"\" the auction; the reduced price is substantially higher than buying from the manufacturer or any reputable retailer directly).\"",

This supports the link between THC concentration and neurocognitive dysfunction. Residual effects, however, continued in subjects who no longer felt the drug's effect.

    "For the US government, they've just credited Person B with a Million USD and haven't gained anything (afterall, those digits are intangible and don't really have a value, IMO). Two flaws in this reasoning: The US government didn't do anything. The receiving bank credited the recipient. If the digits are intangible, such that they haven't gained anything, they haven't lost anything either. In practice, the role of governments in the transfer is purely supervisory. The sending bank debits the sender's account and the receiving bank credits the recipient's account. Every intermediary makes some money on this transaction because the cost to the sender exceeds the credit to the recipient. The sending bank typically receives a credit to their account at a correspondent bank. The receiving bank typically receives a debit from their account at a correspondent bank. If a bank sends lots of money, eventually its account at its correspondent will run dry. If a bank receives lots of money, eventually its account at its correspondent will have too much money. This is resolved with domestic payments, sometimes handled by governmental or quasi-governmental agencies. In the US, banks have an account with the federal reserve and adjust balances there. The international component is handled by the correspondent bank(s). They also internally will credit and debit. If they get an imbalance between two currencies they can't easily correct, they will have to sell one currency to buy the other. Fortunately, worldwide currency exchange is extremely efficient.",

    "\"I used to work for one of the three ratings agencies. Awhile ago. First: There are lots of different ratings. The bulk of ratings are for corporate debt and public finance. So senior debentures (fixed income) and General Obligations e.g. tax-free muni bonds, respectively. Ratings agencies are NOT paid by the investment banks, they are paid by the corporations  or city/ state that is issuing debt. The investment banks are the syndicate that pulls the transaction together and brings it to market.  For mortgage-backed securities, collateralized debt CDO-CLO's, all of which are fancy structured securitizations, well, that is a different matter! Those  transactions are the ones where there is an inappropriately close tie between the investment bankers and ratings agencies. And those were the ratings that blew out and caused problems.  Ratings agencies continued to do a decent job with what WAS their traditional business, corporate and municipal bond ratings, as far as I know.   What khajja said was 100% correct: S&amp;P's fees were paid by investors, the people who were purchasing the bonds, until about 50 years ago. Around the same time that McGraw-Hill purchased S&amp;P, in 1966, they departed from that model, and started charging the bond issuers for ratings. I don't know if that decision was driven by McGraw-Hill or not, though.  One more thing: Not all credit ratings agencies are paid by the issuers. One of the 10 NRSRO's (a designation given by the S.E.C.) is Egan-Jones. Their revenue comes from the investors, bond purchasers, not the companies issuing bonds, unlike the S&amp;P/ Fitch/ Moody's \"\"business model\"\". So there is an alternative, which I consider hopeful and reason not to totally despair.  EDIT: What xcrunna19 mentions is also totally accurate. The part about Nouriel Roubini (who is a professor at N.Y.U. or Columbia or such and a sensible though slightly high strung sort) is consistent with my impression. As for whether it would require government action to implement the changes advocated by Roubini, yes, I guess it would, but I don't know if the government would do that. It would be better if the credit ratings agencies would find their own way to a different, less conflicted payment-incentive model.  Keep in mind too that many of the provisions of Dodd-Frank have removed the existing regulatory requirements for credit ratings on bonds and other securities. This is the scary part though: There isn't anything to replace the credit ratings agencies, not at the moment, as far as I can tell! Eventually the government is supposed to come up with an alternative, but that hasn't happened yet. Which is better: Not requiring ratings at all, or the past situation of sometimes inflated ratings, which imparted a false sense of confidence? I don't know.\"",

    "I believe this argument is most often used when considering which debts to pay back first, or when there are other options available such as investment options, building up an emergency fund, or saving for a large purchase.  In that case, it's simply justifying making minimum payments and paying more over the life of the loan in exchange for larger liquidity in the present. Unfortunately, when it comes to choosing between which debts to pay (e.g. My mom pays more than the minimum on her car because she can't deduct auto loan interest, despite her mortgage carrying a higher interest rate), it's only beneficial if the tax savings offsets the interest savings difference. The formula for that is: tax bracket > (1 - (target loan interest rate / mortgage interest rate)) That said, most people don't think in the long term, either by natural shortsightedness, or by necessity (need to have an emergency fund).",

It's what yahoo told me, but other sources are saying that the beta of KORS is more like -0.01 or close to 0. Yes?   edit 2: Using -0.01 beta, I get a rdWACC of 2.2%. Now this seems more plausible.

You can claim it is all you want, but until you prove its faulty its not. And you yet to prove its actually faulty.   It's a sweeping generalization.

    "\"The question asked in your last paragraph (what's the downside) is answered simply; if you take out a loan and close the cards, that's a ding on your score because your leverage ratio on this portion of your credit jumps to 100% or more, and because you'll be reducing the average age of your lines of credit (one line of credit a few days old versus five lines of credit several years old each). If you take out the loan and don't close the accounts, it's one more line of credit, increasing your total credit, lowering your leverage, but making institutions more reluctant to give you any more credit until they see what you'll do with what you have. In either case, assuming you can get the loan at less than the average rate of the cards (that's actually not a guarantee; a lot of lenders will want APRs in the 20s or 30s even for a title loan or other collateralized loan), then your cost of capital will also go down. That gives you more of a gap of discretionary income that you can better use to \"\"snowball\"\" all this debt as you are planning. Another thing to keep in mind is that the minimum payment changes as the balance does. The minimum payment covers monthly interest at least, and therefore varies based on your interest rate (usually variable) and your balance (which will hopefully be decreasing). A constant payment over the current minimum, much like a more traditional amortization, would be preferable.\"",

When options are issued, they usually do have an expiration date by which you need to exercise if you want to buy the shares. There may be other conditions attached. For instance, whether the plan is about stocks or options, often there is a vesting schedule that determines when you become eligible to buy or exercise. When you buy the shares, they may be registered directly in your name (you might get a fancy certificate), or they may be deposited in an account in your name.

    "When you want to short a stock, you are trying to sell shares (that you are borrowing from your broker), therefore you need buyers for the shares you are selling.  The ask prices represent people who are trying to sell shares, and the bid prices represent people who are trying to buy shares. Using your example, you could put in a limit order to short (sell) 1000 shares at $3.01, meaning that your order would become the ask price at $3.01.  There is an ask price ahead of you for 500 shares at $3.00.  So people would have to buy those 500 shares at $3.00 before anyone could buy your 1000 shares at $3.01. But it's possible that your order to sell 1000 shares at $3.01 never gets filled, if the buyers don't buy all the shares ahead of you.  The price could drop to $1.00 without hitting $3.01 and you will have missed out on the trade. If you really wanted to short 1000 shares, you could use a market order.  Let's say there's a bid for 750 shares at $2.50, and another bid for 250 shares at $2.49.  If you entered a market order to sell 1000 shares, your order would get filled at the best bid prices, so first you would sell 750 shares at $2.50 and then you would sell 250 shares at $2.49. I was just using your example to explain things.  In reality there won't be such a wide spread between the bid and ask prices.  A stock might have a bid price of $10.50 and an ask price of $10.51, so there would only be a 1 cent difference between putting in a limit order to sell 1000 shares at $10.51 and just using a market order to sell 1000 shares and getting them filled at $10.50. Also, your example probably wouldn't work in real life, because brokers typically don't allow people to short stocks that are trading under $5 per share. As for your question about how often you are unable to make a short sale, it can sometimes happen with stocks that are heavily shorted and your broker may not be able to find any more shares to borrow. Also remember that you can only short stocks with a margin account, you cannot short stocks with a cash account.",
    "Disputing the remark seems unlikely to move your score, since it is just that -- a remark.  It's hard to say whether the scoring models can/do read the remarks and incorporate them (somehow) into the scoring metric itself.

In other words, is it showing as an open collection or some other status which would indicate the creditor still has a pending claim?  If so, disputing it might have some effect, although nobody would be able to tell you for certain or even how much your score might be affected. If, as you say, that account should have been part of the bankruptcy package then getting that corrected could be important enough to achieve what you're looking for.

The outstanding principal is the amount left or remaining balance. A program like GnuCash or Quicken makes doing the payment schedule, and applying payments relatively easy to handle.  Spreadsheets will require you to have 36 lines (3 years x 12 months) of payment and recalculation detail, but that shouldn't be too much work.

Once you have your emergency fund started, budget at least enough toward your 401k to capture any matching offered by your employer. Then use the snowball plan to pay off your debts.  (From what your post says, this does not apply to you, but you may have some small credit card debts taht were not discussed).  Earmark the 'extra' for the smallest debt first.  When that debt is paid, the 'extra' grows by the minimum payment of the smallest.  Thus the snowball grows as you pay off debts. Once the debts are gone, reward yourself, within reason (and without going into debt). Now shift your extra into fully funding your retirement savings.  Consult a financial advisor to help you plan how to distribute your retirement savings across the available retirement savings types.  They can explain why it's good to have some of your retirement savings funded from after tax income.  They can help you find the balance between pre- and post-tax funded accounts.   Eventually, you may come to the point where you're putting the max allowed into your tax advantaged retirement accounts.  At your age, this is a significant achievement.

As a frequent traveller, I recommend that you build some flexibility into your plans, especially during the winter. It is not always possible, but try not to need to be somewhere the day of or the day after your flight.  Try to book flights early in the day, as they are less likely to be delayed by problems in flights before them, and you have more options for rebooking.

    "\"From what I've heard in the past, debt can be differentiated between secured debt and unsecured debt.   Secured debt is a debt for which something stands good such as a mortgage on your house.  You have a debt, but that debt is covered by the value of an asset and if you needed to free yourself of the debt, then you could by selling that asset.   This is what is known as \"\"good\"\" debt.   Unsecured debt is debt that is incurred where the only thing that is available to pay it back is your income.  An example of this is credit card debt where you purchase something that couldn't be sold again to pay off the debt.   This is know as \"\"bad\"\" debt. You have to be careful about thinking that house debt is always \"\"good\"\" debt because the house stands good for it though.  The problem with that is that the house could go down in value and then suddenly your \"\"good\"\" debt is \"\"bad\"\" debt (or no longer secured).  Cars are very risky this way because they go down in value.  It is really easy to get a car loan where before long you are upside down.    This is the problem with the term \"\"good\"\" debt. The label makes it sound like it is a good idea to have that debt, and the risk associated with having the debt is trivialized and allows yourself to feel good about your financial plan.  Perhaps this is why so many houses are in foreclosure right now, people believed the \"\"good\"\" debt myth and thought that it was ok to borrow MORE than the home was worth to get into a house.  Thus they turned a secured debt into an unsecured debt and put their residence at risk by levels of debt they couldn't afford. Other advice I've heard and tend to agree with, is that you should only borrow for a house, an education and maybe a car (danger on that last one), being careful to buy a modest house, car etc that is well within your means to repay.   So if you do have to borrow for a car, go for basic transportation instead of the $40,000 BMW.  Keep you house payment less than 1/4th of your take home pay. Pay off the school loans as quickly as possible. Regardless of the label, \"\"good\"\" \"\"bad\"\" \"\"unsecured\"\" \"\"secured\"\", I think that less debt is better than more debt.   There is definitely such a thing as too much \"\"good\"\" debt!\"",
    "I am not a lawyer, but the big thing to consider would be how you would split the money should either of you decide you want to close the account (or, at least her/his portion of the account).  I suspect you'd also need to determine how to split the capital gains/losses for tax purposes.  I can't really see any benefit to a joint account, unless you needed her money to qualify for some of the lower cost funds, and even then the difference in cost would be fairly low, much lower than the cost of having to potentially hire a lawyer to sort out all the questions.",
    "\"Not knowing anything about your situation or what makes it so complex, I would have to agree with the other commenters.  If your accountant screws up your business goes under, but at least your personal finances are safe from that and you'll recover (unless all your wealth is tied up in your business).

Have you set up online bill pay with your bank, so that you can automatically pay all the bills when they arrive?

Again, I don't know your exact situation, but hopefully some of these suggestions help.  Once I started automating my savings and a lot of my bill paying, it gave me a lot of peace of mind.\"",

That being said, there are scenarios like what Peter K. mentioned in his comment, where you're purchasing the building and business outright, but the land it sits on is actually being leased from a separate land-owner.  You may also be seeing the business itself being offered as freehold or leasehold. In this case, you may be purchasing the business of the pub from a pub company, but the building the pub resides in is leased from a property owner.

If that were the case, then, well, I doubt the management would think the UK branch is operating on a healthy basis.  Also, the point the article is trying to make is the losses are *not* just from expansion into the market. No, Starbucks in the UK is healthy and profitable, and the debt costs are inflated by bringing in debt from abroad; debt that has nothing to do with the operating and expansion costs made in the UK, and yet it lowers their tax rate.  This moving around of debt is a scheme only suitable for large multinationals, and I think it's very fair to ask if your tax system should allow such practices.

    "Yes, it's a risk. To put it in perspective, If we look at the data for S&P returns since 1871, we get a CAGR of 10.72%. But, that comes with a SDev (Standard deviation) of 18.67%. This results in 53 of the 146 years returning less than 4%.  Now if we repeat the exercise over rolling 8 year periods, the CAGR drops to 9.22%, but the SDev drops to 5.74%. This results in just 31 of the 139 periods returning less than 4%. On the flip side, 26 periods had an 8 year return of over 15% CAGR.  From the anti-DS article you linked, I see that you like a good analogy. For me, the returns of the S&P over the long term are like going to Vegas, and finding that after you run the math of their craps (dice rolling game) you find the expected return is 10%. You can still lose on a given roll. But over a series of a larger number of rolls, you're far ahead.  To D Stanley - I agree that returns are not quite normal, but they are not so far off. Of the 139 rolling returns, we'd expect about 68% or 95 results to be 1 SDev away. We get 88 returns +/-1SDev. 2 SDevs? We'd expect only 5% to lie outside this range, and in fact, I only get one result on the low side and 4 on the high side, 5 results vs the 7 total we'd expect.

Since it's the same asset, its value should not vary across exchanges once you compensate for exchange rates, right?

Your second question concerns the -19% return calculated for the second quarter.  You seem to think this return is \"\"way-off\"\".  Not really.

Therefore, if I started with $100,000, added $10,000 in cash to the account, and ended up with $100,000 in my account, then my return would be a negative value since I lost the $10,000 that I deposited in the account.

    "\"Yes, your tax bracket is 25%.  However, that doesn't mean that your take home pay will be 75% of your salary.  There is much more that goes into figuring out what your take home pay will be. First, you have payroll taxes.  This is often listed on your pay stub as \"\"FICA.\"\"  The Social Security portion of this tax is 6.2% on the first $118,500 of your pay and the Medicare portion is another 1.45% on the first $200,000.  (Your employer also has to pay additional tax that does not appear on your stub.)  So 7.65% of your salary gets removed off the top. In addition to the federal income taxes that get withheld, you may also have state income taxes that get withheld.  The amount varies with each state. Also, the 25% tax bracket does not mean that your tax is 25% of your entire salary.  You step through the tax brackets as your income goes up.  So part of your salary is taxed at 10%, part at 15%, and the remainder is at 25%. The amount of federal income tax that is withheld from your paycheck is really a rough estimate of how much tax you actually owe.  There are lots of things that can reduce your tax liability (personal exemptions, deductions, credits) or increase your tax (investment income, penalties).

    "\"It's not usually apparent to the average consumer, but there's actually two stages to collecting a payment, and two ways to undo it.  The particular combination that occurs may lead to long refund times, on top of any human delays (like Ben Miller's answer addresses). When you pay with a credit card, it is typically only authorized - the issuing bank says \"\"I'm setting this money aside for this transaction\"\", but no money actually changes hands.  You'll typically see this on your statement as a \"\"pending\"\" charge.  Only later, in a process called \"\"settlement\"\", does your bank actually send money to the merchant's bank.  Typically, this process starts the same day that the authorization happens (at close of business), but it may take a few days to complete.  In the case of an ecommerce transaction, the merchant may not be allowed to start it until they ship whatever you ordered. On the flip side, a given transaction can be voided off or money can be sent back to your card.  In the first case, the transaction will just disappear altogether; in the second, it may disappear or you may see both the payment and the refund on your statement.  Voids can be as fast as an authorization, but once a transaction has started settlement, it can't be voided any more.  Sending money back (a \"\"refund\"\") goes through the same settlement process as above, and can take just as long.

    "\"While I agree that highly processed foods, including plant based meat substitutes, are probably not the best things we could be eating, damning them with scare words like \"\"chemicals\"\" is unhelpful and certainly doesn't account for the bigger picture.  All food is made of chemicals- water is a chemical, broccoli is full of various chemicals.  Looking at the specific nutritional profile of meat alternatives most of them fall somewhere between marginally better and no worse than meat based foods.  Getting protein from leafy greens, whole grains, nuts, and legumes would probably be better, but meat alternatives still make it easier for people to adopt plant based diets, and see them as viable, which is likely to have a positive health impact, or again at least be no worse than an omnivorous diet.  You also discount the non-health related reasons that people choose these options.  Many people may be choosing meat alternatives because of concerns over animal welfare or the environment.  Other people may simply like the taste- many options are different enough from meat to not be comparable from a taste standpoint, and many plant based meat alternatives are much better tasting than similar frozen convenience foods made from animals.\"",

    "My perspective is from the US. Many employers offer 401(k)s and you can always contribute to an IRA for either tax deferred or tax free investment growth. If you're company offers a 401(k) match you should always contribute the maximum amount they max or you're leaving money on the table.    Companies can't always support pensions and it isn't the best idea to rely on one entirely for retirement unless your pension is from the federal government.   Even states such as Illinois are going through extreme financial difficulties due to pension funding issues. It's only going to get worse and if you think pension benefit accrual isn't going to be cut eventually you'll have another thing coming. I'd be worried if I was a state employee in the middle of my career with no retirement savings outside of my pension.   Ranting: Employees pushed hard for some pretty absurd commitments and public officials let the public down by giving in. It seems a little crazy to me that someone can work for the state until they're in their 50's and then earn 70% of their 6 figure salary for the rest of their life. Something needs to be done but I'd be surprised if anyone has the political will to make tough choices now before thee options get much much worse and these states are forced to make a decision.",
    "If the IRA is costing you $100 a year, you should almost certainly transfer it to a cheaper provider, regardless of whether you're going to withdraw anything.  You can transfer the IRA to another provider that doesn't charge you the fees.  Or you can convert it to Roth and combine it with your existing Roth.  Either way, you will keep all the money, and save $100 per year in the future. If you want to take money out of your retirement accounts, you should take it out of your Roth IRA, because you can withdraw contributions (i.e., up to the amount you contributed) from the Roth without tax or penalty. Whether you should withdraw anything from your retirement accounts is a different question.  If you're already maxing out your Roth IRA, and you have sufficient retirement savings, you could just instead plow that $5500 into your student loans.  (If you can afford it, of course, it'd be better to just pay the $7500 from your income and still contribute to the retirement accounts.)

    "If the check is written as a check to BigCo, it is less clear how Jack can compensate himself for the equity sale. It is as if the equity was owned by the corporation, not by Jack. This is correct.  If the check is written to BigCo, then it is BigCo issuing new shares.  Jack doesn't compensate himself for the equity sale, as he didn't sell anything.  The company traded shares for money which it uses for expansion.  In the long term, the capital gain from expansion may exceed the value of a $200,000 no-interest loan to the company.   If the value of the company before investing $250,000 is $1 million, then the value after investing is $1.25 million.  So $250,000 is 20% of the value of the company.  BigCo should not give the buyer 25% of BigCo but only 20% in that example.  If it does give 25%, the buyer is getting a $312,500 stake for only $250,000.   With the other example, Jack sells 25% of the company for $250,000 from his personal shares.  This doesn't change the assessed value of the company, just Jack's stake.  Jack then loans the company $200,000.  This also doesn't change the assessed value of the company (at least in theory).  It gains $200,000 but has an offsetting debt of $200,000.  In net, that's no change.  Assets and liabilities balance the same.   So if you know that the assessed value of the company is $1 million and that the buyer is paying $250,000 for a 25% stake at that same valuation, then you know that the check is being written to Jack.  If the check is written to BigCo, then one or more of those numbers is incorrect.   The buyer could be getting a 20% stake.  The new value of the company after the investment is $1.25 million.   Or paying $333,333.33.  The new value of the company after the investment is $1,333,333.33.   Or BigCo could only be worth $750,000 before the investment.  The new value of the company after the investment is $1 million.   Or Jack is getting screwed, selling $312,500 in stock (25%) for only $250,000.  Jack's shares drop from being worth $1 million to only $937,500.  The value of the company is $1.25 million.   Or some combination of smaller changes that balances.",

    "Usually that is the case that when fixed rates are lower than the variable rates, it is an indication that the banks feel the next movement in rates could be down. You also need to look at the fixed rates for different periods, for example 1 year fixed compared to 3 year fixed and 5 year fixed rates. If you find the 3 and 5 year fixed rates are higher than the 1 year fixed rates this could be an indication that the banks feel rates will fall in the short term but the falls won't last long and will continue to rise after a year or so. If the 3 year fixed rates are also low in comparison, then the banks may feel that the economy is heading for a longer term down trend. The banks won't want to lose out, so will change their fixed rates on their perception of where they feel the economy is headed. Since your post in May 2011, the standard variable rate has since dropped twice (in November and December) to be at 7.30%. You will also find that fixed rates have also been dropped further by the banks, indicating additional future cuts in the variable rates. Regards, Victor",

    "If your uncle is looking to maintain life insurance coverage for specific shorter period of time he may want to look into hybrid life insurance. If you buy a hybrid universal life policy, the premium and death benefit can be guaranteed to last until any age. Since, most permanent policies focus on cash value accumulation it is hard for most people to find cheap whole life or affordable universal life. Consumers only looking for a longer duration have a more flexible choice with a new hybrid product that combines elements of both term life coverage and universal life. Hybrid universal  policies are much cheaper then other permanent coverage such as whole life coverage because they do not emphasize cash value accumulation. However, the premiums and death benefits can still be guaranteed to a specific age (i.e. 85, 90, 95, 100). So, premiums can be scaled to coordinate with your desired budget and the face amount required for your family. Typical universal life and whole life insurance contracts only allow for lifetime coverage. However, hybrid universal life offers a much smaller premium because the coverage can be dialed into a specific age. If the policyholder does live beyond the originally selected age, the death benefit will simply begin getting smaller, while the original premium will  continue to remain the same.",
    "20% is almost certainly too high. I agree with 2%, as a very rough rule. It will vary significantly depending on the industry. I generally calculate an average of the previous 2-3 years working capital, and deduct that from cash. Working capital is Current Assets less Current Liabilities. Current Assets is comprised of cash, prepaid expenses, and significantly, accounts receivable. This means that CA is likely to be much higher than just cash, which leaves more excess cash after liabilities are deducted. Which reduces EV, which makes the EV/EBITDA ratio look even more pricey, as Dimitri noted. But a balance sheet is just a snapshot of the final day of the quarter.

    "The answer to this question is related to another question: How would I invest in Uber? Given that Uber is a privately-held company, the average investor cannot directly buy stock.  However, there are some indirect methods that you can use to invest in Uber, and as a result, it is also possible to indirectly short Uber. One method is to invest in (or short) companies that invest in Uber.  Alphabet/Google (GOOG) owns some, as well as Microsoft (MSFT), Toyota (ADR), and other companies.  Theoretically, you could short these companies, as a hit to Uber would be bad for those companies. Another method would be to look at Uber's competitors.  Think about what companies would do well if Uber went under.  Lyft, perhaps, although it is so similar to Uber that if one has trouble, the other may as well.  Perhaps instead you might invest in a traditional taxi company, or a company that provides services to taxi companies, such as Medallion Financial Corporation (MFIN). Keep in mind that either investing or shorting any of these is not really the same as investing/shorting Uber.  It provides you some exposure in Uber, but your investment is also affected by many other things that have nothing to do with Uber.

    "Chinese suppliers have the option to quote their prices in Chinese Yuan (CNY) rather than in US Dollars (USD) as has traditionally been the practice. This shift allows them to avoid the risks associated with fluctuations in the US Dollar's value. Given that the Chinese Yuan has been generally appreciating, agreeing to receive payments in USD while their expenses are in CNY often results in financial losses for them. Consequently, they need to pad their prices to account for this volatility. Meanwhile, Canadian importers would need to purchase Chinese Yuan (usually with Canadian Dollars, CAD) to pay for their orders. Canadian exporters, on the other hand, can choose to accept payments in Chinese Yuan or set their prices in Canadian Dollars. By eliminating the US Dollar as an intermediary, these transactions become less risky and involve lower costs.\n\nJapan adopted a similar approach several decades ago when they, too, used to price their products in USD. This adjustment is particularly significant in transactions involving large amounts, though it is less critical for smaller transactions, such as those related to tourism.

    "Many super funds, including mine, offer one free strategy switch per year. It is often recommended to shift from a high-growth option to a balanced option approximately 10-15 years before retirement, and then to a capital-guaranteed option a few years prior to retirement. This passive approach has its pros and cons. \n\nThe main advantage is its simplicity: you only need to adjust your investment strategy based on your life stage two to three times during your lifetime. This allows you to take more risks and potentially achieve higher returns when you are young, adopt a balanced approach with moderate risk and returns in mid-life, and minimize risk for stable returns in later years.\n\nHowever, a potential downside is that you might be in a high-risk/high-growth option during a market downturn and switch to a balanced option just as the market starts to recover. This could result in significant losses during the market decline, and you might miss out on the subsequent gains when the market rebounds.\n\nAn alternative, more active approach involves tracking the market and adjusting your investment strategy accordingly. For example, you could monitor the ASX200 index (if your investments are primarily in the Australian stock market) using a 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). If the index crosses above the 200-day SMA, the market is considered bullish, whereas crossing below indicates a bearish trend. This method works well during upward or downward trends but can lead to frequent changes during sideways markets, which might not be ideal.\n\nA more suitable option might be a hybrid approach: use the passive strategy to adjust from aggressive to balanced to capital-guaranteed based on life stages, but apply the active strategy to time these changes. For instance, if you are in your late 40s and plan to switch from an aggressive to a balanced option soon, you could wait until the ASX200 crosses below the 200-day SMA before making the switch. This way, you can capitalize on the bulk of the uptrend before transitioning.\n\nIf you seek greater control over your superannuation assets, you might consider starting a Self-Managed Super Fund (SMSF). However, it is advisable to have at least $300K to $400K in assets before doing so, as the annual costs might otherwise be too high as a percentage of your total super assets.",
    "Did you know that investors aren't always protected from lawsuits? \n\nWell, not in the way you might think. If an investor is a partner in a company, they share responsibility for the business debts just like any other partner. On the other hand, if they're merely a capital investor with no stake in the company's business actions, they can’t be sued. However, in that scenario, my contract wouldn't be with them, would it?\n\nNow, consider this: if the company you work for goes under, sure, you can sue them. But if they’re broke, what are you really going to gain? Interestingly, if it’s a corporation, the registered owners can also be held liable for the company's debts. Plus, you can always negotiate for them to sign as a guarantor for your back pay. \n\nAnd before you say, \"Nobody will ever do that!\", think again. If your service is valuable enough, **YES, THEY WILL**. I once secured a personal liability guarantee from a company owner myself. It’s all about knowing your worth and pushing for it.",

    "I'm involved in both markets, and there are numerous factors to consider. Distribution costs in New York are exorbitantly high. Different states have varying generation mixes, access to fuel, regulatory costs, taxes, availability of green/renewable energy, and mandates. Additionally, the types of market restructuring differ: Texas is fully restructured, whereas New York's partial restructuring has led to chaos—they are even contemplating reverting to a fully regulated model.\n\nFor business customers, my primary recommendations are:\n1. Conduct energy audits and, if relevant, review your processes, equipment, and other factors to ensure you are not using unnecessary energy or causing unnecessary demand peaks.\n2. Avoid signing exclusivity agreements or letters of authorization/power of attorney with brokers. Instead, compare the prices they offer and shop around yourself. If you opt to use a broker, ensure the contract clearly states how much the supplier is paying them per kWh/therm.\n3. Review your usage history, including demand, for at least the past 12 months. Compare this data to the utility tariff you are under, and take any steps necessary to avoid demand charges. Ensure your utility company has not placed you in a demand charge-carrying class if you do not qualify for it.\n\nI would be happy to share more information if anyone is interested.",
    "First, let's address the main point of your question. The primary advantage of a 401k is that you can contribute money without paying income tax on it upfront, and you won't be subject to capital gains taxes on the account's growth. However, there are important restrictions: you can't freely add or withdraw money, and withdrawals are taxed, with significant penalties if withdrawn before age 65. \n\nThese kinds of restrictions apply to all retirement accounts offering tax benefits. Now, regarding the $7,000 not seeming like a benefit—consider this: even with a modest 4% annual growth rate, over 40 years, that initial $7,000 can grow to $34,671. This is not a trivial amount, especially considering that 4% is a conservative estimate; the stock market typically averages between 7% and 10%, and even the bond market averages around 5%.\n\nWhile it's crucial to avoid bankruptcy at all costs, if possible, you should try to avoid withdrawing from your 401k. The penalties and lost earning potential are substantial. For exact calculations on the impact of an early withdrawal, I recommend looking at the numbers shared by u/BeatArmy99 [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/2ct0qy/why_cant_i_access_my_401k_if_its_my_money/cjiorl7).

    "The specifics of the 401(k) are pivotal in the decision-making process. For a 401(k) with high expenses, I would only contribute up to the employer match and ensure that I fully take advantage of the available match. In such instances, having an additional $3,000 on hand might be beneficial, especially if you are starting with a constrained budget. \n\nConversely, for a low-cost 401(k) with an employer match, it is advisable to contribute as much as you can afford. Similarly, for a Roth 401(k) with an employer match, the same expense considerations apply. It is particularly advantageous to utilize a Roth 401(k) when beginning your contributions or if you are in a lower tax bracket. Having a combination of both traditional and Roth accounts is prudent.\n\nIt is important to note that contributing to a Roth now is without risk, regarding the account itself, although not necessarily the investments within it. Should you decide in the following year that the Roth is not suitable, you can withdraw your initial contribution without penalty or tax. In response to the updated query, there are two components to consider regarding Roth deposits: the initial contribution, which allows $3,000 of earned income to be placed in a tax-sheltered account, and the subsequent investment decision. These steps are sequential, and you can deliberate between them carefully.\n\nRegarding the timing of dividends, in an IRA or 401(k), dividends are not taxed, rendering the timing irrelevant in this context. However, in a taxable account, dividends may incur a minor tax liability, but this concern does not apply to tax-deferred accounts.",

    "Based on the discussions in the comments, a pragmatic solution is the most effective immediate course of action, while addressing long-term addiction issues. The initial step is to secure your husband's agreement to surrender all credit cards, allowing you to manage the finances for a defined period, such as three months, to evaluate its effectiveness. This finite timeline increases the likelihood of his cooperation.\n\nSubsequently, provide him with a means to make purchases independently but within a limited budget. Implementing a combination of these options may yield the best outcome. Additionally, consider setting up bank alerts to notify you of purchases made by your husband. Modern banking systems typically offer immediate text or email notifications for transactions, which can be configured based on amount or category.\n\nThe immediate awareness, as opposed to discovering the purchase at the end of the month, might significantly deter impulsive spending and give you the chance to reverse transactions promptly.\n\nIt is crucial to recognize that these measures allow for some degree of enabling and temptation.

    "You should definitely be cautious about these \"penny auction\" websites. Take madbid.com, for example. It's a British site with UK prices, but it works similarly in the US. They claim someone bought an iPod Touch 64GB for just £21.18, while it's £249 directly from Apple. Selling it for £21.18 means there were 2,118 \"bids\".\n\nTo figure out how much bidders actually paid, you'd need to know the cost of a single \"bid\" and multiply that by 2,118, then add the £21.18. I'm pretty sure the total is way more than £249. People getting involved in these scams often think they're the smart ones who will snag a bargain. But honestly, if you think you're smarter than everyone else, you're just fooling yourself.

They also want lots of bidders to drive up the number of bids, and there's nothing stopping them from automatically adding bids if an item looks like it might go too cheap.\n\nJust to be clear: these aren't real auctions. In a typical auction, the highest bidder wins and pays their bid price, plus maybe a commission. With these \"auctions,\" every bid costs money, and by increasing the bid by a penny each time, they ensure there are usually thousands of bids.

    "For the US government, the assignment of a Million USD to Person B might seem inconsequential—they are, after all, just digital figures without tangible value. However, this perspective has two major flaws. First, the US government isn't directly involved in the transaction. It's the recipient's bank that credits the account. Second, if these digits are deemed intangible and hence valueless, they neither increase nor decrease in worth.\n\nIn reality, the government’s role in such transfers is purely supervisory. The sending bank debits the sender’s account, while the receiving bank credits the recipient’s account. All intermediaries profit from the transaction because the sender's cost is higher than the recipient’s credit. The sending bank typically gains a credit in their correspondent bank's account, while the receiving bank incurs a debit.\n\nShould a bank frequently send money, its correspondent bank's account balance may deplete. Conversely, a bank that regularly receives funds will accumulate a surplus. Domestic payments, often facilitated by governmental or quasi-governmental agencies, manage this imbalance. In the US, banks adjust balances via accounts with the Federal Reserve.\n\nInternationally, correspondent banks handle these transactions. They credit and debit internally, but an imbalance between two currencies may necessitate exchanging one currency for another. Fortunately, the global currency exchange system is highly efficient, ensuring smooth corrections.",

However, unlike call options, warrants are issued by the company itself and involve creating new shares, thus diluting the ownership stakes of current shareholders.

    "I used to work for one of the big three ratings agencies a while back. Let me give you an inside look! First of all, there are numerous types of ratings, primarily focused on corporate debt and public finance. Think senior debentures for fixed income and General Obligations like tax-free municipal bonds. Contrary to popular belief, ratings agencies aren't paid by investment banks but by the corporations or cities/states issuing the debt. Investment banks, meanwhile, are the masterminds pulling transactions together and bringing them to market.\n\nNow, when it comes to mortgage-backed securities and complex structured products like collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), it's a different ball game. Here, you do see some unsettlingly close ties between investment bankers and ratings agencies, and these were the transactions that sparked major problems. Despite this, ratings agencies generally did well in their traditional domains, focusing on corporate and municipal bonds.\n\nInterestingly, S&P's fee model shifted about 50 years ago when McGraw-Hill bought them in 1966; before that, their fees were paid by investors who were purchasing the bonds. Whether McGraw-Hill initiated this change remains unclear. But not all credit ratings agencies operate this way; take Egan-Jones, for example. Unlike S&P, Fitch, and Moody's, Egan-Jones gets its revenue from investors, the folks buying the bonds. This model gives me a glimmer of hope that we don't have to be completely disheartened by the system.\n\nAs user xcrunna19 rightly pointed out, Nouriel Roubini, a well-regarded professor, suggests that change might require government intervention. While this seems probable, I'd prefer if ratings agencies independently adopted less conflicted payment models. Complicating matters, many Dodd-Frank provisions have removed existing regulatory requirements for credit ratings on bonds and other securities. Here's the kicker: there's currently nothing to replace these ratings agencies. We're awaiting a government-devised alternative, but until then, which is worse: having no ratings at all or relying on occasionally inflated ones that give a false sense of security? Your guess is as good as mine.",

    "This argument usually comes up when deciding which debts to pay off first or when considering other financial options like investments, building an emergency fund, or saving for a big purchase. Basically, it justifies making minimum payments and paying more interest over the life of a loan to have more cash on hand now. \n\nFor example, my mom pays more than the minimum on her car loan because she can't deduct auto loan interest, even though her mortgage has a higher interest rate. This only makes sense if the tax savings outweigh the interest you'd save.\n\nHere's the formula for that: tax bracket > (1 - (target loan interest rate / mortgage interest rate))\n\nThat said, most people don't think long-term, either because they're naturally shortsighted or they need to keep an emergency fund.",

Should I be using a different beta figure?\n\nAdditionally, when calculating the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC), my E/(D+E) ratio is effectively 1.0 because KORS has a market value of equity of $7 billion and a market value of debt of only $147 million.\n\nAfter further research, I suspect the -0.58 beta from Yahoo is inaccurate. Other sources suggest the beta for KORS is around -0.01 or close to zero. Using a beta of -0.01, I calculated a WACC of 2.2%, which seems more reasonable. Research indicates that significant negative betas are rare and typically associated with gold. Therefore, I believe the -0.01 beta from other sources is correct, rather than the beta provided by Yahoo.",

    "The question posed in your last paragraph—what's the downside?—is straightforward to answer. If you take out a loan and close your credit cards, your credit score will be negatively impacted because your leverage ratio will spike to 100% or more. Additionally, you'll reduce the average age of your credit lines (replacing several long-standing lines with a single, new one). \n\nOn the other hand, if you take out the loan but keep your accounts open, you'll have an additional line of credit. This will increase your total available credit and lower your leverage ratio. However, lenders may become more hesitant to extend you further credit until they can see how you manage your current obligations.\n\nIn either scenario, if you can secure a loan with an interest rate lower than the average rate on your credit cards (which isn't guaranteed, as some lenders may offer APRs in the 20% to 30% range even for secured loans), your overall cost of borrowing will decrease. This reduction in cost frees up more discretionary income, which you can then use to strategically \"snowball\" your debt, as you mentioned.\n\nFinally, remember that your minimum payment requirement will vary with your balance and interest rate, which are typically variable. A fixed payment amount above the current minimum—similar to traditional amortization—would be more effective in paying down your debt.",

Options generally come with an expiration date by which they must be exercised to purchase the shares. Additional conditions often apply.

Upon purchasing the shares, ownership may be registered directly in your name, which could result in receiving a certificate, or they may be deposited into an account in your name.

    "When you want to short a stock, you're attempting to sell shares that you borrow from your broker, so you need buyers for those shares. The ask prices represent sellers, while the bid prices represent buyers. For example, you could place a limit order to short (sell) 1,000 shares at $3.01, which would set the ask price at $3.01. If there is an existing ask price for 500 shares at $3.00, those shares must be bought before anyone can buy your 1,000 shares at $3.01. However, your order might not be filled if buyers don't purchase all the shares ahead of you, and the price could drop to $1.00 without reaching $3.01, causing you to miss the trade.\n\nIf you definitely want to short 1,000 shares, you could use a market order. For instance, if there’s a bid for 750 shares at $2.50 and another bid for 250 shares at $2.49, a market order to sell 1,000 shares would fill first at $2.50 for 750 shares, then at $2.49 for 250 shares. In reality, bid-ask spreads are usually narrower. A stock might have a bid price of $10.50 and an ask price of $10.51, just a 1 cent difference. Thus, placing a limit order at $10.51 or using a market order to sell at $10.50 would yield similar results.\n\nAdditionally, brokers generally don't allow shorting stocks trading under $5 per share. Short sales can sometimes be prevented if a stock is heavily shorted and the broker cannot find shares to borrow. Remember, short selling is only allowed with a margin account, not a cash account.",
    "Challenging the remark on your credit report is unlikely to alter your score significantly, as it is merely a comment. It's uncertain whether scoring models can read and incorporate these remarks into the actual score. However, disputing a revolving account that should be marked as closed is another issue entirely. The main concern is the current status of that account—whether it is listed as an active collection or in a similar state that suggests the creditor still has an outstanding claim. If that’s the case, disputing could possibly impact your score, though the extent of that change is unpredictable. If you believe the account should have been included in your bankruptcy filing, then correcting this discrepancy might be crucial for achieving your intended credit report accuracy. It’s worth a try to see if it makes a difference, but regardless of the outcome, it's important to ensure your credit report accurately reflects your financial situation.

    "If you're aware of the combined amounts ($5,000 and $7,500 in your example) rather than the original loan amounts, you can determine a payment schedule using tools like Excel, Google Sheets, or online calculators, based on that combined amount and the interest rate. Once you have the payment schedule, you can apply your payments ($100). Ensure that interest accrues if your $100 does not cover the monthly payment, or apply any excess towards the principal if it exceeds the payment amount. The outstanding principal will be the remaining balance.\n\nUsing software like GnuCash or Quicken can simplify creating the payment schedule and managing the payments. If you’re using a spreadsheet, you’ll need to detail 36 lines (for 3 years x 12 months) of payments and recalculations, but this shouldn't be too much work.

    "You expect interest because you give up the opportunity to use the money yourself and take on the risk that the borrower might not repay you. The same applies to gold—if you lent someone your gold for a period, you would expect interest in return. When you deposit money in the bank, you are lending it to the bank, which then lends it to others. This process allows the bank to pay interest on your deposits.",
    "Start by creating budget categories and allocate your income to these categories as soon as you receive it. Make sure to cover all your bills and expenses. When it comes to debts, only pay the minimum required on each. After budgeting, any remaining money is considered 'extra.' Use this 'extra' to prioritize the following steps:\n\n1. Build an emergency fund that covers 3-6 months of living expenses, adjusting according to your comfort level. \n2. Once your emergency fund is established, contribute enough to your 401k to take full advantage of any employer matching.\n3. Use the snowball method to pay off your debts, starting with the smallest. Allocate the 'extra' towards this debt, and as each debt is paid off, the amount you can put towards the next one grows larger, creating a snowball effect. If you have small credit card debts, this applies to them as well.\n\nOnce all your debts are eliminated, treat yourself within reason, but avoid incurring new debt. Shift your 'extra' funds into maximizing your retirement savings. Consult a financial advisor to help you balance contributions between pre-tax and post-tax retirement accounts. They can also guide you in maximizing your tax-advantaged retirement accounts, which will be a significant milestone.\n\nAny remaining funds after maximizing retirement savings can be used as you wish. If you choose to focus on wealth building, it can lead to financial independence. Look into FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) for advice on frugal living and wealth-building strategies. This community often aims to save enough to live off passive income from interest and dividends, with many targeting retirement before the age of 50. Given your age and income, you might even achieve this by 40, though it requires strong commitment and a particular mindset. This path may not suit everyone, but it could be ideal for you.",

    "You need travel insurance. It's rarely a credit card perk, but you can buy it separately. Decide if it's worth the cost, especially for expensive trips like cruises. Frequent travelers may find it less valuable as the cost might outweigh the benefits over multiple trips.\n\nAs a frequent traveler, build flexibility into your plans, especially during winter. Avoid needing to be somewhere right after your flight lands. Book early flights to reduce the risk of delays, and you'll have more rebooking options.\n\nFlight delays due to weather or mechanical issues are common. Full flights can make rebooking difficult. Be polite to gate agents and airline staff—they can't control delays but will be more willing to help if you're nice. Be assertive with your needs, but a smile and a kind word go a long way.",
    "I would be cautious about using Yelp. I've heard stories of businesses having problems with them. For instance, a business might have ten 5-star reviews and one 2-star review. However, Yelp might only show the 2-star review on the company's main page. Then, Yelp would contact the business owner and offer to display the 5-star reviews on the main page for a fee. This practice seems shady, but it's not illegal since businesses choose to use Yelp's service.",

This makes sense because if all doctors did were surgeries, there wouldn't be any doctors except surgeons.\n\nThe limit on medical schools is an interesting point. I hadn't heard about it before and it sounds like it really drives up costs. The only good thing is that it keeps the quality of doctors really high, but I can see how that's a big drawback.",

    "Debt can generally be categorized into secured debt and unsecured debt. Secured debt is backed by an asset, such as a mortgage on your house. This type of debt is often referred to as \"good\" debt because the asset can be sold to repay the loan if necessary. However, it's crucial to remember that the value of the asset can decrease, turning your \"good\" debt into \"bad\" debt. For example, homes and cars can lose value, which may leave you with debt that exceeds the asset's worth, making the debt no longer secured.\n\nOn the other hand, unsecured debt is not backed by any asset, and repayment relies solely on your income. Credit card debt is a common example, where purchases can't easily be resold to cover the debt. This type of debt is often seen as \"bad\" debt because it lacks any collateral to offset the risk.\n\nIt’s important to be cautious of the terms \"good\" and \"bad\" debt, as these labels can be misleading. They might lead you to underestimate the risks associated with having debt, fostering a false sense of security about your financial situation. For instance, the belief in the \"good\" debt myth has led many to borrow more than their home value, contributing to the foreclosure crisis when they couldn't meet their repayment obligations.\n\nSound financial advice suggests borrowing only for essential needs like a house, education, and possibly a car, with a preference for modest purchases within your means. For example, instead of splurging on a luxury vehicle, opt for basic transportation. Keep your house payment below one-fourth of your take-home pay, and strive to pay off educational loans as quickly as possible.\n\nIn summary, regardless of the type—secured or unsecured, \"good\" or \"bad\"—less debt is generally better than more debt. It's important to recognize that even too much of what is considered \"good\" debt can become a financial burden.",
    "I'm not a lawyer, but a crucial point to think about is how you'd divide the money if one of you chooses to close the account or at least their share of it. You'd also likely have to figure out how to split any capital gains or losses for tax purposes. Frankly, I don't see much advantage in having a joint account unless you need her money to qualify for some lower-cost funds. Even in that case, the savings would be minimal compared to the potential expense of hiring a lawyer to resolve all the complications.",
    "Without knowing the specifics of your situation or the complexities involved, I agree with the other commenters. If an accountant mishandles your business finances, it could lead to your business failing, but your personal finances would typically remain protected, allowing you to recover—unless all your wealth is tied up in the business.\n\nOn the other hand, if a virtual assistant were to misuse your personal information, it could result in loss of money, damaged credit, and numerous other issues. Recovering from such violations would be a lengthy and difficult process.\n\nIf managing your finances for a few hours each month is becoming overwhelming, consider exploring alternative ways to automate and organize them. Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. **E-bills**: Ensure that as many bills as possible are electronic and sent directly to your bank.\n2. **Online Bill Pay**: Set up online bill pay with your bank to automatically pay bills as they arrive.\n3. **Financial Management Tools**: Use online services like Mint, Thrive, or your bank’s virtual wallet/portfolio for budgeting and expense tracking.\n\nEven without knowing your exact situation, I hope these recommendations prove helpful.

Taking this step was incredibly worthwhile before becoming a host—highly recommend it!",
    "When it comes to property ownership, the terms \"Freehold\" and \"Leasehold\" carry specific meanings that are crucial to understand. Freehold means you own the property outright. In contrast, leasehold indicates a rental arrangement. However, the real world often presents more nuanced scenarios. For instance, as Peter K. mentioned, you might buy a building and the business within it, yet the land it sits on could be leased from a different owner. \n\nSometimes, you encounter businesses like pubs marketed as either freehold or leasehold. This could mean you're purchasing just the pub business—complete with its brand, decor, and partnerships—but the building housing the pub remains under a lease from another property owner. Essentially, you’d own everything about the pub except the walls and roof enclosing it.\n\nTo navigate these complexities, consider hiring an Estate Agent. They are invaluable in refining your search and might even uncover hidden opportunities that aren’t advertised. So, if you're diving into the property market, an Estate Agent's expertise could be your best asset.",

    "You're suggesting that Starbucks' losses in the UK are simply due to the costs of expanding into the market. If that were the case, the management probably wouldn't view the UK branch as being on solid ground. However, the article argues that the losses aren't just from market expansion. In fact, Starbucks in the UK is healthy and profitable. The real issue is that their debt appears inflated by borrowing from abroad—debt unrelated to their UK operations and expansion—which conveniently lowers their tax rate.\n\nThis kind of financial maneuvering is a luxury only large multinationals can afford. It's absolutely fair to question whether the tax system should permit such practices. After all, the small coffee shop on the corner or your local chain with a few stores can't exploit these loopholes and end up paying a much higher tax rate.",
    "Certainly. Here is a more formal version of the text:\n\nIndeed, it involves a certain degree of risk. To put this into perspective, an analysis of S&P 500 returns since 1871 reveals a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 10.72%, accompanied by a Standard Deviation (SDev) of 18.67%. Consequently, 53 out of the 146 years yielded returns of less than 4%. \n\nWhen this analysis is performed over rolling eight-year periods, the CAGR decreases to 9.22%, while the SDev falls to 5.74%. This results in only 31 out of 139 periods producing returns below 4%. Conversely, 26 periods achieved eight-year returns exceeding a 15% CAGR. From the anti-DS article you referenced, I note your appreciation for a good analogy. To me, the long-term returns of the S&P 500 can be likened to gambling in Las Vegas, wherein the expected return for craps (a dice game) is 10%. Although losses can occur on any given roll, over a larger series of rolls, the expected return significantly favors the player. \n\nAddressing Mr. Stanley's observation - I concur that returns are not perfectly normally distributed, but they are not substantially deviant either. Among the 139 rolling returns, we would anticipate approximately 68%, or 95 results, to fall within one standard deviation. The actual data shows 88 results within ±1 SDev. For two standard deviations, one would expect only 5% to fall outside this range. In the actual findings, only one result is on the low side and four on the high side, amounting to five results as opposed to the expected seven. The outcomes suggest a somewhat more profitable scenario than would be indicated by a normal bell curve distribution.",
    "If I buy VUSA from one exchange, can I sell it on a different exchange, assuming my brokerage account lets me trade on both? Or is it somehow tied to the exchange I bought it from? This doesn’t apply to all securities or all stock exchanges, so it depends on your broker and country. I asked Selftrade about VUSA, and they said I can only trade it in the same currency and on the same exchange where I bought it. Most brokers probably have the same rule for regular folks, but banks or millionaires might have different options.\n\nVUSA is listed in GBP on the LSE and in EUR on the AEX, and it was created by an Irish company with an Irish ISIN. Chris mentioned below that this kind of thing happens between US and Canadian exchanges, but it’s not common across all exchanges. You can’t trade inter-listed stocks between the LSE and NYSE. Since it's the same asset, its value should stay consistent across exchanges once you account for exchange rates, right? Otherwise, it would open up easy arbitrage opportunities, and everyone would jump on that. Any differences get quickly corrected by market players using sophisticated computers.\n\nIf there’s no currency risk, what other factors should I consider when choosing an exchange to trade on? You might want to think about liquidity, time differences (like Japanese markets closing while you’re still asleep), tax implications in different countries, investor protections, finding brokers that cover the markets you’re interested in, dealing with multiple brokers, and regulatory issues.",

    "During Graham's career, gold and currency were essentially equivalent due to the gold standard. He advised against investing in currencies, focusing instead on bonds and stocks, and recommended stocks only for intelligent speculation. Graham passed away a few years after Nixon ended the gold standard by closing the gold window. \n\nToday, gold can still be considered a form of currency, as it is used by endowments and other investors as a store of value and for risk diversification. However, investing in currencies or commodities does not align with Graham's principles. Accurately estimating the intrinsic value of a currency or commodity to achieve a Graham-like margin of safety, where the intrinsic value significantly exceeds the market value, is challenging. \n\nClaims that gold is \"clearly underpriced in today's market\" lack substantiation. Graham's approach, such as the \"net-net\" method—which values stocks based on their current tangible assets minus all liabilities—is grounded in quantitative analysis of audited accounting numbers, providing a genuine margin of safety.",
    "Many partnership agreements feature a shotgun clause: one party sets a price, and the other can either buy at that price or sell to the initiator. It's a rather harsh mechanism. Strategic offers can be made, potentially lower than the company's value, especially if you know the other party will have to accept under unavoidable circumstances, such as their inability to run the business without you. \n\nCurrently, he's requested $X for his buyout. If that can't be arranged, he prefers to retain his share and have his wife—who might be capable but is also dealing with his serious illness—take over his role. If he can occasionally contribute to the strategic vision while she manages daily operations, maintaining the status quo could be the practical choice. However, the situation doesn't compel you to pay more than you believe the company's half is worth.\n\nWithout a formal partnership agreement in place, navigating forward is challenging. One tactic is to act as though a shotgun clause exists. Ask him if he thinks the company's half is worth $X, and if he's prepared to purchase your share at that same price and let his wife manage the business without you. He might reveal that it's overvalued and that she isn't up to the task. At this juncture, meaningful negotiations can begin.",

Using your home as collateral can be a mental challenge, and if investments don't perform as expected, the outcomes could be unfavorable. By tapping into your home equity, you also diminish your financial buffer if the real estate or investment markets decline.

Therefore, it's crucial to seek advice from a professional financial advisor to assess whether this strategy fits your needs, and if so, to custom-tailor it to your and your family's unique financial circumstances.",
    "It’s astonishing that you can't grasp whether you’re just naive, young, or deliberately trolling. You keep suggesting that if we don’t like taxes, we can simply \"go to Somalia.\" That's completely false. Even if I wanted to abandon my American citizenship and move to Somalia, I would still be required to pay taxes. If leaving were entirely free, you might have a point that by not leaving, we're choosing to stay. But that’s far from reality. There are significant costs associated with leaving and renouncing citizenship, which means we're under a form of duress in this so-called \"agreement\" you argue we make. Edit: Are you seriously unable to understand that I'm referring to exit taxes—not the usual income, property, or other taxes?",
    "If you contribute capital to the company, it's not considered a taxable event. However, if you're the owner and you provide a loan to the company, it might be beneficial if you want to earn interest, especially if other partners aren't lending money. A loan enables you to receive interest payments, which are taxable income (reported on a 1099-INT form), but the company can deduct the interest as an expense. On the other hand, making a capital contribution is simpler and allows you to take distributions later to recover your investment without any tax implications, though you won't receive interest.",
    "The TWRR calculation still works even when dealing with negative values. Consider this formula: TWRR = (1 + 0.10) x (1 + (-0.191)) x (1 + 0.29) ^ (1/3) = 1.047, which translates to a 4.7% return. Now, regarding your concern with the -19% return for the second quarter, you might think this is \"way off,\" but in reality, it's not. \n\nThe TWRR measures the return by factoring in any cash added or withdrawn from the account. For instance, if I start with $100,000, add $10,000, and end up with $110,000, the return on my investment is 0% because the balance increase is solely from the additional cash. Conversely, if I start with $100,000, add $10,000, and end up with $100,000, it's a negative return since I've essentially lost the $10,000 I put in.\n\nIn your case, you started the second quarter with $15,000, deposited $4,000, and ended with $15,750. This means you lost nearly all of the $4,000 you deposited, which is indeed a significant loss.",
    "Your tax bracket is 25%, but this doesn't mean you'll take home 75% of your salary. There are several factors affecting your take-home pay. First, there are payroll taxes, usually labeled \"FICA\" on your pay stub. This includes a 6.2% Social Security tax on the first $118,500 of your income and a 1.45% Medicare tax on the first $200,000. Note that your employer also contributes additional taxes not shown on your stub, so 7.65% of your salary is immediately deducted.\n\nIn addition to federal income tax, your paycheck might also have state income taxes deducted, which vary by state. Importantly, being in the 25% tax bracket doesn't mean you pay 25% on your entire salary. You pay different rates on portions of your income: 10%, 15%, and then 25% on the remaining amount.\n\nThe federal income tax withheld from your paycheck is an estimate of your total tax liability. Various factors, such as personal exemptions, deductions, and credits, can decrease your overall tax bill, while investment income and penalties can increase it. When preparing your tax return, you'll determine the actual tax due, which may result in either a refund if too much was withheld or a payment if too little was taken out.",

In theory, you might persuade them to increase their limit by agreeing to cancel the other card. However, since you're unable to do a balance transfer due to your current debt levels, you would need them to raise the limit first. They will evaluate your income, credit history, credit score, and the age of your account with them to determine if you're eligible for an increase.

    "One of the most striking examples of the perils of prioritizing profit over quality is the story of Schlitz Brewing Company. Once a Fortune 500 titan, Schlitz decided to cut corners in the 70s to boost its profit margins. They sped up the fermentation process, switched to using corn syrup instead of malt, and used hop pellets rather than fresh hops. To make up for the loss in quality, they added unusual additives, which sometimes turned the beer to the consistency of \"snot.\" While the short-term profits soared, loyal customers soon abandoned the brand.\n\nFor a more contemporary perspective, consider these companies from the 2012 Fortune 500 list:\n\n- **Morgan Stanley**: Involved in the global economic crash, they sold financial products to customers while secretly betting against them.\n- **Bank of America**: They doubled interest rates on customers in good standing and introduced fees for everything, including speaking to a teller.\n- **General Motors**: They've cheapened their car interiors, now made mostly of plastic.\n\nThese modern-day examples emphasize that the temptation to sacrifice quality for profit is still very real.",
    "The company likely wants to pay you for a product via a purchase order rather than as a contractor. Can they re-issue the check to you as a sole proprietor under a business name like ABC Consulting?

This allows you to open a business bank account and use the company's check as your first deposit.\n\nIf re-issuing the check isn't possible and you need to form an LLC, gather $125 by doing odd jobs or borrowing. Besides the LLC filing fee, your bank may require an Operating Agreement. This agreement, simple or detailed (especially crucial with a partner), outlines responsibilities and profit distribution.\n\nFor single-member LLCs, boilerplate forms are available online, but for partnerships, it's advisable to consult an attorney for accuracy.

    "As a former intern, here are some tips for you:\n\n- Ditch the attaché.\n- Save the suit for specific occasions like client meetings or special events, unless otherwise expected.\n- Observe your surroundings: if your team or floor doesn’t wear ties, you shouldn’t either (unless it’s one of those special occasions). The same goes for suits and other formal wear. \n- You’re free to dress as you like, but avoid going overboard. The same principle applies to your work hours — try to sync up with your team. As an intern, you’re not expected to stay as late as 8 pm; typical hours are around 9-6, depending on your area or team. Don’t be the intern who bolts at exactly 5:00 pm — this isn’t a retail shift.

    "We may have an oversupply of retail square footage, but many of these spaces will be repurposed into showrooms. The future of retail still includes brick-and-mortar stores since consumers prefer sensory experiences, such as the ability to touch products. In the future, customers may visit stores to see items but have them delivered to their homes the same day or the next day. This approach allows stores to occupy smaller spaces, as they won't need to carry large inventories; local warehouses will handle that. Stores will function mainly as showrooms to showcase products and possibly serve as locations for customers to pick up or return items.\n\nThe current buzzword is \"experiential.\" Stores need to provide experiences that digital platforms cannot. For example, when I first heard the term \"experiential,\" I thought about the now-closed Sports Authority, which had large spaces filled with items I could easily find at Walmart, Target, or order from Amazon. There was no unique draw. Reflecting on it, those stores had enough square footage to host mini rock climbing gyms or simulation activities for sports like tennis and golf. Such experiences could attract people, especially children, repeatedly. If retail stores do not offer these types of engaging experiences, they will struggle to survive.",
    "Although I haven't personally gone through being a \"grad student poor\" (I attended grad school at night while working full-time), I would aim to save 10-20% of your monthly income ($150-$300). This, of course, depends on your current savings. If you don't have much saved up, you might want to aim for a higher savings rate (30-40%). If you have the option to move to a more affordable place, consider doing it as soon as possible. Housing is your largest expense, and any place where you can spend less than $900 will provide immediate savings without needing to cut back on your living expenses.",
    "In my view, debit cards seem to be at a disadvantage because they don’t involve lending money, which might appear bad for banks. But that's not entirely accurate. While it's true they don't lend money, banks charge retailers a significant commission for each transaction, which is pure profit with minimal risk. Congress is considering (or may have already approved) a proposal to cap this commission. This change would turn debit cards into just a service for checking account holders rather than a profit center for banks. For individuals, this is beneficial. \n\nI disagree, though. Debit cards are more convenient than checks, but they offer much less protection compared to credit cards. Here’s what I previously mentioned on this topic, and it seems like the community agrees.\n\nWhy do we need a credit history to buy expensive items? Because the system is flawed. It rewards people in debt by giving them more opportunities to incur even more debt, while those who are debt-free struggle to get credit when they need it. The current system only allows creditors to assess the risk of someone who already has debt; they can't evaluate someone with no debt history. To me, this entire credit card system seems like a lucrative scheme backed by the government.\n\nHowever, it's not the credit cards themselves but the credit score system that's broken. If you replace \"card\" with \"score\" in your question, then you're on the right track. This applies to the U.S.—I’m not familiar with how creditors assess risk in other countries.",
    "The founders are almost certainly liable for taxes on the \"income\" they effectively gain from not being charged rent. It's unclear, however, if the corporation also has to pay income tax on the rent it isn't collecting from them. Seeking advice from a professional tax accountant is highly recommended, as it not only provides clarity but also offers protection in case this arrangement is ever scrutinized.",
    "It isn't usually obvious to the typical consumer, but there are actually two phases in processing a payment and two methods to reverse it. The specific combination of these can result in prolonged refund times, in addition to any human delays (as Ben Miller's answer explains). When you make a payment with a credit card, it is generally only authorized - meaning the issuing bank says, \"I'm reserving this money for this transaction,\" but no actual funds transfer occurs yet. This is usually visible as a \"pending\" charge on your statement. Only later, through a process called \"settlement,\" does your bank transfer the money to the merchant's bank. This process usually starts at the end of the business day when the authorization happens, but it might take a few days to complete. For ecommerce transactions, the merchant may not be allowed to initiate the process until they ship your order. Conversely, a transaction can either be voided or refunded. In the first case, the transaction simply disappears; in the second case, it might disappear or you might see both the payment and the refund on your statement. Voids can occur as quickly as authorizations, but once a transaction has entered the settlement phase, it can no longer be voided. Refunding money (a \"refund\") goes through the same settlement process and can take just as long. Specifically, in answer to your question: You receive the SMS when the transaction is authorized, even though no funds have been transferred. The refund won’t appear until several days after someone initiates it, and there is no \"reverse authorize\" function to notify you or your bank in advance.",

    "I've been considering a mix of ELSS (Equity-Linked Savings Scheme) and Tax Saving Fixed Deposits. But is this the right decision? What other choices do I have?

Other options include life insurance, retirement plans offered by mutual funds, or NSC (National Savings Certificate).",
    "Eight hard inquiries over two years? No big deal if you’ve got a solid score of 750! Now, here’s the first big question: How much of your credit limits are you using right now? Using less than 30% is good, under 15% is even better, and keeping it around 10% is fantastic!\n\nDon’t stress about waiting a certain number of days after applying for a mortgage or a new card to boost your approval odds for other credit. Just keep an eye on how many hard pulls you’ve had in the reporting period. But really, like I said, 8 hard inquiries over a couple of years isn’t going to hurt much at all.\n\nNext big question: What kind of negative marks are lurking in your credit history? Are we talking young age, lower income, missed payments, bankruptcies, or low credit limits? Some of these can be tricky — like having low limits because you’re young and your credit history is still growing. But these factors do play a role in how much lenders are willing to let you borrow.",
    "While I agree that highly processed foods, including plant-based meat substitutes, might not be our top dietary choices, using fear-inducing terms like \"chemicals\" is counterproductive and overlooks the bigger picture. Remember, all food consists of chemicals—water is a chemical, and even broccoli is packed with various chemicals. When we examine the specific nutritional profiles of meat alternatives, most range from being marginally better to no worse than meat-based foods. Though getting protein from leafy greens, whole grains, nuts, and legumes might be superior, meat alternatives make it easier for people to transition to plant-based diets and see them as viable options. This shift can have a positive health impact or, at the very least, be no worse than an omnivorous diet.\n\nAdditionally, it's important not to ignore the non-health-related reasons people choose these options. Many opt for meat alternatives due to concerns about animal welfare or the environment. Others simply enjoy the taste. Many plant-based meat alternatives offer unique flavors that aren't directly comparable to meat and, in many cases, taste better than similar frozen convenience foods made from animals.",
    "In a long-term bull market, optimistic investor sentiment pushes prices upward, with participants generally being net buyers over time. These extended market trends are usually influenced by significant national and global events, such as shifts in demographics and governmental policies. While bear markets can occur during these longer periods, they don't typically reverse the overall trend. There are still numerous reasons to consider buying long-term bonds, even if yields are low due to the nearly flat term structure of interest rates. Despite recent downgrades in U.S. sovereign credit ratings, U.S. Treasury bonds still offer relatively higher security compared to many other options. If Germany were not part of the EU, its government bonds would be managed by the Bundesbank and denominated in Deutsche Marks; in that scenario, German government bonds might be a preferable choice over U.S. 30-year Treasuries. Nonetheless, long-term U.S. Treasuries remain in demand among investment and portfolio managers because:",
    "From a U.S. perspective, numerous employers provide 401(k) plans, and individuals can also contribute to an IRA to benefit from either tax-deferred or tax-free investment growth. It’s advisable to take full advantage of any 401(k) match offered by your employer to avoid missing out on essentially free money. Given the financial strain on companies, relying solely on a pension for retirement is risky unless it is a federal government pension. States like Illinois are facing severe financial challenges due to pension funding problems, and this situation is likely to deteriorate further. It’s crucial not to depend entirely on a state pension, especially if you are midway through your career without other retirement savings. \n\nMany employees have demanded unreasonable pension commitments, and public officials have failed the populace by conceding to these demands. It is concerning that someone can work for the state until their 50s and then receive 70% of their six-figure salary for life. Action is necessary, but it's doubtful that anyone currently has the political courage to make the difficult decisions needed to prevent worsening conditions and force states into inevitable choices.",
    "If your IRA is costing you $100 annually, it's wise to transfer it to a more affordable provider, even if you don't plan on making withdrawals. You can switch your IRA to a provider that doesn't impose such fees or convert it to a Roth IRA and merge it with your existing Roth account. Either approach allows you to retain all your funds and save $100 each year going forward. \n\nIf you intend to withdraw funds from your retirement accounts, it’s best to take them from your Roth IRA since you can withdraw your contributions (up to the amount you initially contributed) without incurring taxes or penalties. Deciding whether to withdraw from your retirement accounts, however, is another matter. \n\nIf you are already maximizing contributions to your Roth IRA and have adequate retirement savings, consider redirecting that $5,500 towards paying off student loans instead. Ideally, if possible, it’s better to use $7,500 from your income for loan repayment while continuing contributions to your retirement accounts. There's no benefit in withdrawing from retirement savings to settle loans when you can use your current income for this purpose.",

    "After diving deep into this topic, I've found that the common belief is actually a myth. Long-term asset growth does not align with the compound interest rate of expected return. Yes, the standard deviations of annualized returns do decrease over time, but since the asset value fluctuates, the standard deviations of the total return actually increase. So, the notion that you can take on more risk just because you have a longer time horizon is completely misguided.",

    "When the check is made out to BigCo, it becomes ambiguous how Jack can compensate himself for the equity sale, as it appears the equity belongs to the corporation, not Jack. This interpretation is accurate. When the payment goes to BigCo, it signifies that BigCo is issuing new shares, not Jack. Therefore, Jack doesn't profit from selling the equity personally; instead, the company raises funds through the share issuance, which it can use for expansion. Over time, the capital gains from this expansion may surpass the value of a $200,000 no-interest loan to the company.\n\nFor example, if BigCo's valuation is $1 million before investing $250,000, then post-investment, its value becomes $1.25 million. Thus, $250,000 represents a 20% stake in the company. BigCo should only offer the buyer a 20% share, not 25%, in this scenario. Providing a 25% share means the buyer receives a $312,500 stake for the $250,000 investment.\n\nConversely, if Jack sells 25% of the company for $250,000 from his personal shares, it doesn't alter the company's assessed value, only Jack's ownership percentage. Jack then lends $200,000 to the company, which doesn't impact the company's assessed value theoretically, as the company gains $200,000 but accrues a $200,000 liability, leaving the net value unchanged. Assets and liabilities remain balanced.\n\nIf the company's valuation is $1 million and the buyer pays $250,000 for a 25% stake at that valuation, it implies that the check is written to Jack. Any other scenario involving the check being payable to BigCo suggests that some figures are off. For instance, the buyer might actually be acquiring a 20% stake, bringing the company's value to $1.25 million post-investment. Alternatively, the buyer could be paying $333,333.33, raising the company's valuation to $1,333,333.33. Another possibility is that BigCo's pre-investment worth might be $750,000, making the post-investment value $1 million. In such a case, Jack might be at a disadvantage, selling $312,500 worth of stock (25%) for just $250,000, resulting in his shares dropping in value from $1 million to $937,500, with the company’s total valuation at $1.25 million. Any of these scenarios or a combination thereof could explain the valuation adjustments.",

    "When fixed rates are lower than variable rates, it typically signals that banks anticipate a downward movement in rates. It is important to examine the fixed rates over different periods, such as 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year fixed terms. If 3-year and 5-year fixed rates are higher than 1-year fixed rates, this suggests that banks expect a short-term decline in rates with a subsequent rise. Conversely, if 3-year fixed rates are also low, this indicates that banks foresee a prolonged economic downturn. Banks will adjust their fixed rates based on their economic outlook to avoid losses. Notably, since your post in May 2011, the standard variable rate has decreased twice (in November and December) to 7.30%. Correspondingly, fixed rates have been further reduced by banks, signaling anticipated future cuts in variable rates. Regards, Victor",

While not emphasizing cash value, hybrid policies guarantee premiums and death benefits up to a specific age (e.g., 85, 90, 95, 100), allowing customization to fit your budget and family needs. Unlike typical lifetime coverage of universal and whole life policies, hybrids offer reduced premiums with coverage tailored to a specific age.

    "A 20% estimate is almost certainly too high. I agree with using 2% as a rough guideline, although this can vary significantly depending on the industry. Typically, I calculate an average of the working capital over the previous 2-3 years and deduct that from cash. Working capital is defined as Current Assets minus Current Liabilities. \n\nCurrent Assets include cash, prepaid expenses, and accounts receivable, which means they are likely to be much higher than just cash. This results in more excess cash after liabilities are deducted, thereby reducing the Enterprise Value (EV) and making the EV/EBITDA ratio appear more expensive, as Dimitri noted.\n\nHowever, it's important to remember that a balance sheet is just a snapshot of the final day of the quarter. Due to seasonal effects, it's critical to smooth this data by averaging it over several periods. After doing these calculations for a few companies, compare the working capital to revenue.

However, I strongly advocate for legislation that allows individuals working 85 (or 60) hours a week—equivalent to 12-hour days for 85 hours per week—to sustain themselves. By \"sustain,\" I mean being able to afford modest housing, nutritious food, decent health insurance, clothing (even second-hand), and saving a little.\n\nMinimum wage jobs are typically held by young people entering the job market and older individuals with limited skills.

    "Got a question about investing in Uber? Well, it's a bit tricky since Uber is a privately-held company, meaning you can't just go out and buy its stock directly. But don't worry, there are some workaround methods you could try to get involved.\n\nFirst off, you can invest in companies that have put money into Uber. Think Alphabet/Google (GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Toyota (ADR), and a few others. If you think Uber is going to struggle and want to short them instead, you could look into shorting these companies since they’ve got a stake in Uber.\n\nAnother angle is to check out Uber’s competitors. For example, if Uber takes a hit, companies like Lyft might benefit (although, to be fair, Lyft has its own challenges). You could also think outside the box—maybe investing in a traditional taxi company or one that supports taxi services, like Medallion Financial Corporation (MFIN).\n\nJust keep in mind that investing or shorting these companies isn't the same as doing it directly with Uber. You're getting some indirect exposure to Uber’s performance, but it's influenced by a bunch of other factors too.\n\nFor more details, you might want to check out the Investopedia article \"Ways to Invest in Uber before It Goes Public.\" And just so you know, I'm not advising you to actually go out and do any of this!"
