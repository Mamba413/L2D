    "The full cost of damage in Newton Stewart, one of the areas worst affected, is still being assessed. Repair work is ongoing in Hawick and many roads in Peeblesshire remain badly affected by standing water. Trains on the west coast mainline face disruption due to damage at the Lamington Viaduct. Many businesses and householders were affected by flooding in Newton Stewart after the River Cree overflowed into the town. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon visited the area to inspect the damage. The waters breached a retaining wall, flooding many commercial properties on Victoria Street - the main shopping thoroughfare. Jeanette Tate, who owns the Cinnamon Cafe which was badly affected, said she could not fault the multi-agency response once the flood hit. However, she said more preventative work could have been carried out to ensure the retaining wall did not fail. \"It is difficult but I do think there is so much publicity for Dumfries and the Nith - and I totally appreciate that - but it is almost like we're neglected or forgotten,\" she said. \"That may not be true but it is perhaps my perspective over the last few days. \"Why were you not ready to help us a bit more when the warning and the alarm alerts had gone out?\" Meanwhile, a flood alert remains in place across the Borders because of the constant rain. Peebles was badly hit by problems, sparking calls to introduce more defences in the area. Scottish Borders Council has put a list on its website of the roads worst affected and drivers have been urged not to ignore closure signs. The Labour Party's deputy Scottish leader Alex Rowley was in Hawick on Monday to see the situation first hand. He said it was important to get the flood protection plan right but backed calls to speed up the process. \"I was quite taken aback by the amount of damage that has been done,\" he said. \"Obviously it is heart-breaking for people who have been forced out of their homes and the impact on businesses.\" He said it was important that \"immediate steps\" were taken to protect the areas most vulnerable and a clear timetable put in place for flood prevention plans.

    "A fire alarm went off at the Holiday Inn in Hope Street at about 04:20 BST on Saturday and guests were asked to leave the hotel. As they gathered outside they saw the two buses, parked side-by-side in the car park, engulfed by flames. One of the tour groups is from Germany, the other from China and Taiwan. It was their first night in Northern Ireland. The driver of one of the buses said many of the passengers had left personal belongings on board and these had been destroyed. Both groups have organised replacement coaches and will begin their tour of the north coast later than they had planned. Police have appealed for information about the attack. Insp David Gibson said: \"It appears as though the fire started under one of the buses before spreading to the second. \"While the exact cause is still under investigation, it is thought that the fire was started deliberately.\"",
    "John Edward Bates, formerly of Spalding, Lincolnshire, but now living in London, faces a total of 22 charges, including two counts of indecency with a child. The 67-year-old is accused of committing the offences between March 1972 and October 1989. Mr Bates denies all the charges. Grace Hale, prosecuting, told the jury that the allegations of sexual abuse were made by made by four male complainants and related to when Mr Bates was a scout leader in South Lincolnshire and Cambridgeshire. \"The defendant says nothing of that sort happened between himself and all these individuals. He says they are all fabricating their accounts and telling lies,\" said Mrs Hale. The prosecutor claimed Mr Bates invited one 15 year old to his home offering him the chance to look at cine films made at scout camps but then showed him pornographic films. She told the jury that the boy was then sexually abused leaving him confused and frightened. Mrs Hale said: \"The complainant's recollection is that on a number of occasions sexual acts would happen with the defendant either in the defendant's car or in his cottage.\" She told the jury a second boy was taken by Mr Bates for a weekend in London at the age of 13 or 14 and after visiting pubs he was later sexually abused. Mrs Hale said two boys from the Spalding group had also made complaints of being sexually abused. The jury has been told that Mr Bates was in the RAF before serving as a Lincolnshire Police officer between 1976 and 1983. The trial, which is expected to last two weeks, continues.",
    "Patients and staff were evacuated from Cerahpasa hospital on Wednesday after a man receiving treatment at the clinic threatened to shoot himself and others. Officers were deployed to negotiate with the man, a young police officer. Earlier reports that the armed man had taken several people hostage proved incorrect. The chief consultant of Cerahpasa hospital, Zekayi Kutlubay, who was evacuated from the facility, said that there had been \"no hostage crises\", adding that the man was \"alone in the room\". Dr Kutlubay said that the man had been receiving psychiatric treatment for the past two years. He said that the hospital had previously submitted a report stating that the man should not be permitted to carry a gun. \"His firearm was taken away,\" Dr Kutlubay said, adding that the gun in the officer's possession on Wednesday was not his issued firearm. The incident comes amid tension in Istanbul following several attacks in crowded areas, including the deadly assault on the Reina nightclub on New Year's Eve which left 39 people dead.",
    "Veronica Vanessa Chango-Alverez, 31, was killed and another man injured when an Audi A3 struck them in Streatham High Road at 05:30 GMT on Saturday. Ten minutes before the crash the car was in London Road, Croydon, when a Volkswagen Passat collided with a tree. Police want to trace Nathan Davis, 27, who they say has links to the Audi. The car was abandoned at the scene. Ms Chango-Alverez died from multiple injuries, a post-mortem examination found. No arrests have been made as yet, police said. Ms Chango-Alverez was staying at her mother's home in Streatham High Road. She was born in Ecuador and had lived in London for 13 years, BBC London reporter Gareth Furby said. At the time of the crash, she was on her way to work in a hotel. The remains of the bus stop, which was extensively damaged in the crash, have been removed. Flowers have been left at the site in tribute to the victim. A statement from her brother Kevin Raul Chango-Alverez said: \"My family has had its heart torn out, at this Christmas time, we will never be the same again. \"On Friday night we were together as a family with Veronica meeting her newly born nephew and preparing for Christmas. \"I last saw her alive as she left to go to work on Saturday morning, but moments later I was holding her hand as she passed away in the street.\" Describing the crash as \"horrific\" Det Insp Gordon Wallace, said: \"The family are devastated. The memory of this senseless death will be with them each time they leave their home. \"The driver fled the scene abandoning the grey Audi, which was extensively damaged. \"We are looking to speak to Mr Nathan Davis in relation to this collision.\" The 51-year-old man injured at the bus stop remains in a critical condition in hospital while the condition of the 29-year-old driver of the Volkswagen is now stable.",
    "Belgian cyclist Demoitie died after a collision with a motorbike during Belgium's Gent-Wevelgem race. The 25-year-old was hit by the motorbike after several riders came down in a crash as the race passed through northern France. \"The main issues come when cars or motorbikes have to pass the peloton and pass riders,\" Team Sky's Rowe said. \"That is the fundamental issue we're looking into. \"There's a lot of motorbikes in and around the race whether it be cameras for TV, photographers or police motorbikes. \"In total there's around 50 motorbikes that work on each race. \"We've got a riders union and we're coming together to think of a few ideas, whether we cap a speed limit on how fast they can overtake us. \"Say we put a 10 kilometres per hour limit on it, if we're going 50kph they're only allowed to pass us 60kph or something like that.\" Demoitie, who was riding for the Wanty-Gobert team, was taken to hospital in Lille but died later. The sport's governing body, the UCI, said it would co-operate with all relevant authorities in an investigation into the incident. The Professional Cyclists' Association (CPA) issued a statement asking what would be done to improve safety. Despite Demoitie's death, attitudes to road racing will stay the same says Rowe, who has been competing in Three Days of De Panne race in Belgium. \"As soon as that element of fear slips into your mind and you start thinking of things that could happen, that's when you're doomed to fail,\" he told BBC Wales Sport. \"If you start thinking about crashes and the consequences and what could potentially happen then you're never going to be at the front of the peloton and you're never going to win any races.\" In a separate incident, another Belgian cyclist, Daan Myngheer, 22, died in hospital after suffering a heart attack during the first stage of the Criterium International in Corsica.",
    "Gundogan, 26, told BBC Sport he \"can see the finishing line\" after tearing cruciate knee ligaments in December, but will not rush his return. The German missed the 2014 World Cup following back surgery that kept him out for a year, and sat out Euro 2016 because of a dislocated kneecap. He said: \"It is heavy mentally to accept that.\" Gundogan will not be fit for the start of the Premier League season at Brighton on 12 August but said his recovery time is now being measured in \"weeks\" rather than months. He told BBC Sport: \"It is really hard always to fall and fight your way back. You feel good and feel ready, then you get the next kick. \"The worst part is behind me now. I want to feel ready when I am fully back. I want to feel safe and confident. I don't mind if it is two weeks or six.\" Gundogan made 15 appearances and scored five goals in his debut season for City following his £20m move from Borussia Dortmund. He is eager to get on the field again and was impressed at the club's 4-1 win over Real Madrid in a pre-season game in Los Angeles on Wednesday. Manager Pep Guardiola has made five new signings already this summer and continues to have an interest in Arsenal forward Alexis Sanchez and Monaco's Kylian Mbappe. Gundogan said: \"Optimism for the season is big. It is huge, definitely. \"We felt that last year as well but it was a completely new experience for all of us. We know the Premier League a bit more now and can't wait for the season to start.\" City complete their three-match tour of the United States against Tottenham in Nashville on Saturday. Chelsea manager Antonio Conte said earlier this week he did not feel Tottenham were judged by the same standards as his own side, City and Manchester United. Spurs have had the advantage in their recent meetings with City, winning three and drawing one of their last four Premier League games. And Gundogan thinks they are a major threat. He said: \"Tottenham are a great team. They have the style of football. They have young English players. Our experience last season shows it is really tough to beat them. \"They are really uncomfortable to play against. \"I am pretty sure, even if they will not say it loud, the people who know the Premier League know Tottenham are definitely a competitor for the title.\"",
    "The crash happened about 07:20 GMT at the junction of the A127 and Progress Road in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex. The man, who police said is aged in his 20s, was treated at the scene for a head injury and suspected multiple fractures, the ambulance service said. He was airlifted to the Royal London Hospital for further treatment. The Southend-bound carriageway of the A127 was closed for about six hours while police conducted their initial inquiries. A spokeswoman for Essex Police said it was not possible comment to further as this time as the \"investigation is now being conducted by the IPCC\".",

    "Weaknesses in the way mice swapped data with computers left them vulnerable, said security firm Bastille Networks. Attackers could spoof poorly protected signals letting them use PCs as if they were sitting in front of them, it said. Information about the loopholes have been passed to the makers of vulnerable mice, some of who are creating updates to make the mice more secure. The radio signals sent by many wireless mice to a \"dongle\" plugged in to a computer were often unencrypted, said Marc Newlin and Balint Seeber, from Bastille, who carried out the research. \"That makes it possible for the attacker to send unencrypted traffic to the dongle pretending to be a keyboard and have it result as keystrokes on your computer,\" Mr Newlin said. By contrast, they said, signals sent by wireless keyboards were scrambled to stop attackers eavesdropping on or spoofing them. The pair found they could spoof signals for mice using a few lines of code and an antenna and dongle that cost $20 (Â£15). The attack worked at distances of up to 180m (590ft). Using this kit, they sent specially crafted mouse clicks that a computer interpreted as key presses, letting them run commands and take control of a target machine. The Bastille researchers said many companies spent a lot of time and money securing the physical devices sitting on their networks but often neglected to keep an eye on data sent via radio. Wireless mice produced by HP, Lenovo, Amazon and Dell were found to be vulnerable. Bastille said it had reported its findings to the hardware makers and to the company that made the chipset used inside the spoofable mice. Updates to the internal computer code, or firmware, for some of the vulnerable mice are now being made available, But Bastille said many of the insecure mice it had found could not be updated.",
    "Administrators confirmed the redundancies affecting 38 staff at Galashiels-based Murray and Burrell. The business, established in 1928, went into administration last week citing \"adverse trading conditions\". There are hopes some of the workers affected could find posts at another building firm in nearby Melrose which currently requires staff. Thomson Cooper partner Richard Gardiner was appointed as administrator at Murray and Burrell on Monday. A statement confirmed: \"Directors explored all options in an effort to preserve trading and jobs. \"Regrettably, 38 jobs were lost as there is no prospect of continuing to trade.\" South of Scotland MSP Rachael Hamilton described it as a \"sad day for the Borders\". However, some of the workers laid off could find employment with a Melrose-based company. JS Crawford has said that, with several housing projects on its books, it needs staff.",
    "The EC's doubts about the arrangement were detailed in a document on Friday. The EC said that its \"preliminary view is that the tax ruling... by Luxembourg in favour of Amazon constitutes state aid.\" However, Amazon said it \"has received no special tax treatment from Luxembourg\". \"We are subject to the same tax laws as other companies operating here [in Luxembourg],\" it said. The Luxembourg finance ministry said: \"Luxembourg is confident that the state aid allegations in this case are without merit and will be able to convince the Commission of the legitimacy of the anticipatory decision in question and that no competitive advantage was granted,\" it said. The European Commission began a probe of the tax arrangement last year, saying that it had suspicions it broke EU rules. The Commission document, which was sent to the Luxembourg Ministry of Foreign Affairs in October, gives its rationale for launching the investigation. The Commission said it had \"no indication\" that the tax arrangement was \"compatible with the internal market\". The current European Commission chief, Jean-Claude Juncker, was prime minister of Luxembourg when the deal was struck. Mr Juncker has come under pressure over claims that around 340 global companies were granted tax  avoidance deals during his 18 year tenure in Luxembourg. Commission doubts over the Amazon deal included whether Luxembourg had properly looked into Amazon's \"transfer pricing\" proposals about how money would be moved between different Amazon subsidiaries. Doubts also existed about whether the country had assessed that the proposed tax regime was in line with market conditions before agreeing the deal in 2003, the European Commission document said. The Commission also had questions about how royalty payments between certain Amazon companies were calculated, and whether \"Amazon has a financial incentive to exaggerate the amount of the royalty\" between its Luxembourg head office company and an Amazon firm that holds shares in the head office company. \"If the royalty is exaggerated, it would unduly reduce the tax paid by Amazon in Luxembourg by shifting profits to an untaxed entity from the perspective of corporate taxation,\" the EC said. It added that Luxembourg might have been too hasty in assessing Amazon's requested arrangement before striking the deal. Luxembourg's finance ministry said it \"has provided all the information required by the Commission and cooperated fully with the Commission in its investigation.\" \"Among other things, detailed reports on the transfer price requested by the Commission were disclosed,\" it added. Luxembourg is also being investigated by the Commission over suspected \"sweetheart\" tax deals with the financing arm of carmaker Fiat. In addition, Ireland's tax deal with Apple and the Netherlands' arrangement with Starbucks are being scrutinised as part of a crackdown on multinationals' tax avoidance schemes.",
    "The three-day extravaganza of farming, food and family fun celebrates many aspects of agricultural life. The Balmoral Show is run by the Royal Ulster Agricultural Society (RUAS) and dates back 148 years. Last year, it attracted more than 90,000 visitors to its recently-adopted home outside Lisburn in County Antrim. It was traditionally staged at the RUAS's headquarters in south Belfast, but the show moved to a larger venue on the site of the former Maze prison in 2013. The Maze venue, re-named Balmoral Park, is now hosting the show for the fourth consecutive year. The 2016 event coincides with Northern Ireland's Year of Food and Drink, and local produce features prominently in the exhibitions. One of this year's highlights is an \"edible garden\", in which visitors can see their food growing in the ground before it gets to their plates. The aim of the garden is to encourage people to grow their own food at home. The event will also showcase the best of local livestock, with prized pigs, cattle, poultry and ponies all lining up in bid to be the stars of the show. Their owners will also get a chance to shine, with horse riding and show jumping displays along with sheep shearing competitions and awards for the best livestock breeders and handlers. For younger visitors, there is a family fun area hosting displays from the Northern Ireland School of Falconry as well as a gun dog skills demonstration and a performance from balloon artist Bruce Airhead. BBC News NI are covering the event live on social media on Wednesday on Twitter at @BBCNewsNI, on Snapchat at bbcnewsni, and on BBC Newsline's Facebook page.",
    "Mr Mosley wants Google to block photos of him at a sex party first printed in the now-defunct News of the World, which he successfully sued in 2008. He is suing the internet firm for breaches of the Data Protection Act and misusing private information. Google's barrister argued that Mr Mosley no longer has a \"reasonable expectation of privacy\". Mr Mosley won damages from the News of the World after it published a story alleging he had organised a Nazi-themed orgy. Photographs and a video which show his private sexual activity were originally obtained by News Group Newspapers Limited (NGN) in a clandestine \"sting\" operation. Mr Mosley - the son of 1930s fascist leader Sir Oswald Mosley - won Â£60,000 after a judge ruled there was no substance to the allegation that there had been a Nazi theme to the sex party and found that his privacy had been breached. In that ruling, the High Court also said the article was not in the public interest. Mr Mosley has said the role-play at a rented Chelsea basement flat was harmless, consensual and private. On launching his legal action last year, Mr Mosley urged: \"Google should operate within the law rather than according to rules it makes itself. It cannot be allowed to ignore judgements in our courts.\" Google has said it will remove URLs that it is alerted to, but is not prepared to remove the images entirely from its search engines. In court on Wednesday, Google's barrister Antony White QC for Google conceded that it was technically possible to remove the images and was \"not burdensome\" to do so. However, he argued that Google was not the publisher of the private information, and that Mr Mosley no longer had a reasonable expectation of privacy in relation to the images. On that basis, Google will seek to show that Mr Mosley's claim is unfounded. The hearing is due to conclude on Thursday.",

Eddie has been excellent all year for us, he has really stepped up to the mark and will be a big loss.\" However, Jones says Jackson's misfortune can be a chance for others to thrive. \"We are very fortunate to have the likes of Ollie Griffiths, Harrison Keddie, James Thomas who can come into the back-row,\" said Jackson. \"Harri has shown glimpses of what he can do all season and there's definitely a player there, so this is an opportunity.\" Dragons travel to Munster in the Pro12 on Friday.",
    "The announcement ends months of uncertainty for Cornish Language Partnership staff whose contracts had been due to end. Local government minister Andrew Stunnell said the three-year funding package for the service would help make sure the language survived. But he warned that long term funding should come from Cornwall. He said it was \"important to make sure the Cornish were given the opportunity to put down sound foundations.\" \"In the longer term support for the Cornish language is going to be something which is going to have to be based in Cornwall and will not come from London,\" he added. The Cornish Language Partnership's, Jennifer Lowe, said: \"We can now plan for the future thanks to the funding.\" The United Nations recently upgraded the status of the Cornish language from \"extinct\" to \"critically endangered\".

Monaco finished eight points ahead of nearest rivals Paris St-Germain to be crowned champions of France in 2016-17. \"I feel part of AS Monaco and the principality,\" said Portuguese Jardim, the former Olympiakos boss. Monaco also beat Tottenham and Manchester City on their way to reaching the semi-finals of the Champions League during 2016-17, before losing to Juventus 4-1 on aggregate in the semi-finals.

    "A State Department spokesman said the election process was flawed and could not be seen as free and fair. He said the Ortega government had side-lined opposition candidates and limited monitoring of the polls. Daniel Ortega won 72.5% of the vote with 99.8% of the ballots counted. His closest rival, centre-right candidate Maximino Rodriguez, only received 14.2% of the vote. The State Department's Mark Toner  said the Ortega government had not invited international election observers, which he said, \"further degraded the legitimacy of the election\". \"We continue to press the Nicaraguan government to uphold democratic practices, including press freedom and respect for universal human rights in Nicaragua,\" he added. Mr Ortega had been widely expected to win both due to the popularity of his social programmes and because he faced no obvious political challenger. A former left-wing rebel, Mr Ortega has led Nicaragua through a period of economic stability which has made him popular with the country's business sector and foreign investors. Supporters of Mr Ortega took to the streets to celebrate his victory. But even before the first results were announced, members of the opposition coalition Broad Front for Democracy (FAD) called the elections a \"farce\". The FAD, which had urged voters to boycott the election, alleged that more than 70% had abstained from voting. They were contradicted by the electoral authorities which put voter participation at 65.8%. Mr Ortega's running mate was his wife, Rosario Murillo, who now looks set to become vice-president. Analysts say that Ms Murillo already shares decision-making with Mr Ortega and could become president if her 70-year-old husband were to bow out. Nicaragua's economy has grown at double the Latin American average, but the country still needs to attract more foreign investment. A $50bn (£40bn) plan to build an interoceanic canal across Nicaragua with Chinese investment has gained international attention, but there are serious doubts over whether it will ever be built. The country has been able to avoid the sky-high murder rates of some of its Central American neighbours but it also faces the ever pervasive threat of drug-trafficking.",
    "The decision comes after 170,000 activists from around the world demanded action to help lesbians targeted for \"corrective rape\". The authorities have been accused of not doing enough following the recent killing and rape of lesbian activist Noxolo Nogwaza. Police say they do not consider sexual orientation when investigating murder. \"To us, murder is murder, whether somebody is Zulu, English, male or female - we don't see colour, we don't see gender,\" police ministry spokesman Zweli Mnisi told the BBC on Tuesday, after rights groups urged the police to do more to find those responsible Ms Nogwaza's death. She was stoned, stabbed and gang-raped in the KwaThema township east of Johannesburg over the Easter weekend. Unlike in many African countries, homosexual acts are legal in South Africa and discrimination based on sexual orientation is banned, but activists say gay and lesbian people are often attacked in townships. They say \"corrective rape\" - when a lesbian is raped to either punish her, or \"correct\" her behaviour - is becoming increasingly common. Ndumie Funda, founder of the gay rights organisation Luleki Sizwe which works in 10 black townships and rural areas near Cape Town, welcomed the government's announcement. She said it was important to get \"corrective rape\" classified as a hate crime. \"The South African constitution is one of the highly respected and acknowledged constitutions and it says we are all equal; we're therefore reminding our government to say that this was being promised and we voted for you so we need protection,\" she told the BBC's Network Africa programme. Luleki Sizwe started an online petition at Change.org to get the government to take action. \"In less than six months, a tiny group of township activists has mobilised more than 170,000 people from 163 countries and gotten the highest levels of government to address their basic demand, that the sadistic crime of 'corrective rape' be taken seriously,\" Change.org representative Benjamin Joffe-Walt is quoted by the Sapa news agency as saying. Justice ministry spokesman Tlali Tlali said the the task team would begin its work in July and include six representatives from the judiciary, police and department of social development and six representatives from the gay community. \"The team will be charged with developing a legislative intervention plan, a public awareness strategy, and LGBTI [lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex]-sensitive shelters,\" he said. In 2008, female footballer and gay rights activist Eudy Simelane was also killed in KwaThema, some 80km (50 miles) east of Johannesburg. Two people were given long prison terms for her murder and rape, although prosecutors denied that her sexuality had been a motive.",
    "Big oil producing nations meet this weekend in Qatar to discuss plans for a freeze in production levels. But there is scepticism over whether such a deal would make much difference to the current oversupply of oil in the market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 28.97 points to 17,897.46. The S&P 500 was down 2.05 points to 2,080.73. The technology focused Nasdaq Composite slipped 7.67 points to 4,938.22.

Shares in banking giant Citigroup closed 0.13% down after trading mostly higher all day. It reported a 27% fall in quarterly profit, but that was not as bad as analysts had been expecting. Shares of Marathon Petroleum were down 3.8%, Exxon Mobile fell 0.5% and Chevron was 0.75% lower. Shares of Apple dropped 2% after a report suggested the company was cutting iPhone production in the April-June quarter due to weak sales. Investors also had a gloomy economic report to chew over.

    "Mr Varoufakis said Greece was subject to a programme that will \"go down in history as the greatest disaster of macroeconomic management ever\". The German parliament approved the opening of negotiations on Friday. The bailout could total €86bn (£60bn) in exchange for austerity measures. In a damning assessment, Mr Varoufakis told the BBC's Mark Lobel: \"This programme is going to fail whoever undertakes its implementation.\" Asked how long that would take, he replied: \"It has failed already.\" Mr Varoufakis resigned earlier this month, in what was widely seen as a conciliatory gesture towards the eurozone finance ministers with whom he had clashed frequently. He said Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, who has admitted that he does not believe in the bailout, had little option but to sign. \"We were given a choice between being executed and capitulating. And he decided that capitulation was the optimal strategy.\" Mr Tsipras has announced a cabinet reshuffle, sacking several ministers who voted against the reforms in parliament this week. But he opted not to bring in technocrats or opposition politicians as replacements. As a result, our correspondent says, Mr Tsipras will preside over ministers who, like himself, harbour serious doubts about the reform programme. Greece must pass further reforms on Wednesday next week to secure the bailout. Germany was the last of the eurozone countries needing parliamentary approval to begin the talks. But the head of the group of eurozone finance ministers, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, has warned that the process will not be easy, saying he expected the negotiations to take four weeks. On Saturday, the Greek government ordered banks to open on Monday following three weeks of closures. But the decree stated that the weekly withdrawal limit should be a maximum €420. Separately, the European Council approved the €7bn bridging loan for Greece from an EU-wide emergency fund. The loan was approved in principle by eurozone ministers on Thursday and now has the go-ahead from all non-euro states. It means Greece will now be able to repay debts to two of its creditors, the ECB and International Monetary Fund (IMF), due on Monday.",
    "The IPC opened proceedings against the National Paralympic Committee of Russia after a report claimed the country had operated a widespread doping programme. A decision on any ban will come in the week commencing 1 August. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has opted against a blanket ban. \"I can assure you that our board will take the right decision in the interest of sport and the interest of the Paralympic movement moving forward,\" said Craven. On Sunday, the IOC said it would leave it up to the governing bodies of individual sports to decide if Russian competitors are clean and should be allowed to take part. But Craven, himself a member of the IOC, was critical of that decision and said the IPC would not necessarily follow suit. \"I am disappointed in their decision, but that is a personal view,\" he added. \"We have to acknowledge their right to take such a decision. This is ultra-serious. I don't think there has been a situation in the past where you have had institutional doping on such a scale. \"We believe the Russian NPC is either unwilling or unable to uphold the IPC anti-doping code, which is in line with the World Anti-Doping Agency code, so that is what they have to respond to.\" Canadian law professor Richard McLaren's report, published last week, claimed Russia operated a state-sponsored doping programme from 2011 to 2015. The IPC said it acted after McLaren provided the names of the athletes associated with the 35 \"disappearing positive samples\" from the Moscow laboratory highlighted in the report. Nineteen samples potentially doctored as part of the sample-swapping regime during the 2014 Sochi Paralympic Winter Games have been sent for further analysis. Russia will have up to 21 days to appeal against any IPC decision, with the Rio Paralympics due to begin on 7 September.",

King is not financially involved in the team but will take a leading role on the business side of the operation. Fitzpatrick's investment is a personal one and the money he has put into the team does not come from Ovo. He said: \"I have a lifelong passion for F1 and can't wait for the season ahead.\" Manor Marussia have announced Englishman Will Stevens will be one of their drivers and said a deal to sign the second would be completed soon. The team's new car, a modified version of the 2014 model, must pass F1's mandatory crash tests before they can race at the season-opening Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne from 13-15 March. Those tests are scheduled to take place this week. Graeme Lowdon, who has been with the team through its various guises as Manor, Virgin and Marussia, remains as president and sporting director. He said: \"It has been a challenging period for all of us but we've come through it and now we just want to go racing again. \"With formidable new business leadership in Stephen Fitzpatrick and the board presence of Justin King, we are now in a great place ahead of the new season. This is a fantastic and very rewarding moment for all those involved with the team.\"",
    "The destination of a stimulus package worth nearly £39m was agreed as part of the Welsh government's budget deal with the Liberal Democrats. Finance Minister Jane Hutt said it would help \"generate immediate benefits\" for the economy. But Plaid Cymru said it was \"completely inadequate\" and the Conservatives said it should go to council tax payers. Labour and the Lib Dems announced a budget deal on Friday night, ending weeks of negotiations between ministers and opposition parties. With 30 of the assembly's 60 seats, Labour needs the help of at least one other party to approve its spending plans. The £38.9m windfall - to be spent over two years - also formed part of budget discussions. The money is coming down from the Treasury as a result of a council tax freeze in England. A programme to help businesses hire young recruits is among projects receiving funding. The government said an extra £4.9m would create 1,800 more apprenticeships. Some £9m will go towards upgrading school buildings, with the same amount spent on delivering an additional 130 homes. The government will spend £3.5 improving roads in places where it is planning to create enterprise zones. Five parts of Wales have been earmarked as zones where businesses will get help to grow. First Minister Carwyn Jones has said that copying the UK government by using the money to keep down council tax would not significantly benefit the economy, adding that tax bills for band D homes were lower on average in Wales. Labour has faced criticism from opponents, particularly Plaid Cymru, for not doing enough to respond to a deteriorating economic situation. Ms Hutt pointed to other government spending commitments, intended to help growth. She said she had considered proposals to spend the money from across the government. She said: \"This package builds on those actions to boost the economy and develop public services, generating immediate benefits for our economy while complementing our long term aims.\" Conservative shadow finance minister Paul Davies said he was disappointed ministers were using additional resources to \"top up\" existing policies. He said: \"There is nothing new in this package other than a fresh attempt by Welsh Labour ministers to be seen to act on the economy, while spending money which would be better spent by taxpayers themselves.\" Welsh Lib Dem leader Kirsty Williams said her party will also work with the government on how to spend any money allocated to Wales as a result of Tuesday's Autumn Statement by Chancellor George Osborne. \"The Welsh Liberal Democrats approach will be to continue to get our economy moving and improve the quality of life for people in Wales,\" she said. Plaid Cymru economy spokesman Alun Ffred Jones said: \"For over six months, Labour has sat back and done nothing - exposing Wales to the full force of this economic crisis. \"Now, they're trying desperately to create the impression that this small sum of money will do what's needed. Quite simply, it will not.\"",
    "Network Rail and Thames Water engineers are at the scene after the hole appeared in Forest Hill on Monday. The disruption is expected to last until Wednesday, with Southern, Thameslink and London Overground services affected. Thames Water said a sewer under the track had collapsed. It said the repair work was \"extremely complex\" and that engineers had located the problem section of the sewer and were working to seal it. Dry concrete has been put into the hole, forming a base to pour wet concrete on top. Once it has set, about 50 tonnes of ballast will be inserted, with the aim of opening the railway on Wednesday. Network Rail has closed all four lines between East Croydon and London Bridge, meaning Southern services to London Bridge are either cancelled or diverted. London Overground services are not running between West Croydon/Crystal Palace and New Cross Gate. Carl Leadbetter, Thames Water's regional network manager, said: \"Our teams continue to work as fast as possible on this critical job. \"While we need to work quickly to reopen the train lines, we also need to consider local residents, who will potentially suffer from sewer flooding if the pipe is not properly enclosed. \"This is an extremely complex job as the pipe is in a difficult location in the tracks and six metres below the ground.\" Network Rail apologised for the delays and said it was working \"as hard as possible\" to get the problem fixed by Wednesday morning's rush hour. Spokesman Chris Denham said the hole \"couldn't be in a worse place\". \"This is a massive piece of railway,\" he told BBC Radio London. \"It's the equivalent of shutting the A2 out of London in the morning. It's absolutely huge.\" Some passengers expressed their frustration on social media, mentioning how the problem occurred on the hottest day of the year so far. Elsewhere in London, high temperatures have been disrupting trains between the city and the West, with speeds being cut over fears of rails buckling. Trains coming out of Paddington, Euston and Liverpool Street all saw severe disruption. And Southern services heading to Brighton from Victoria were heavily disrupted following a track failure in the Gatwick area. It comes as commuters have experienced months of cancellations and delays on Southern trains due to an RMT dispute. New rail minister Paul Maynard will appear before the Commons Transport Select Committee on Wednesday to give evidence on the Department for Transport's role in the issue.

    "Overflow pipes at the Burry Inlet near Llanelli are used to help stop flooding. But the European Court of Justice ruled this broke clean water laws in a special conservation area. The Welsh Government, Natural Resources Wales and Welsh Water said they were investing in improvements. Though the UK has not been fined, it will have to pay legal costs in a case that also found a number of other breaches around the handling of waste water in England and Gibraltar. The problems stem from the UK's ageing Victorian sewers, engineering marvels of their time, but now out of date. The pipes were designed to mix both sewage and rainwater but over the years new housing developments and more frequent storms as a result of climate change have put pressure on the system. Welsh Water has 3,000 special overflow pipes which act as relief valves to deal with the extra sewage and rainwater but go straight into rivers and the sea. At the Burry Inlet there are 14 overflow pipes which discharge into an area supposed to be protected by UK and EU laws. It includes salt marshes and is a habitat for tens of thousands of wild birds during the winter. 2,200 hectares of saltmarsh - largest continuous area in Wales 20,000 waterfowl are supported 13,590  oystercatchers 35,000  wildbirds spend winter including curlew, godwit and shelduck The local cockling industry has also been hit but Welsh Water insisted this was not due to their discharges. It is investing in a Â£113m project to reduce the number of spills. RainScape involves reducing the amount of water that reaches the sewers through planting green spaces on streets and roofs to absorb rain and building channels to capture surface water. The UK argued the improvements would mean it could comply with EU clean water laws by 2020. However, the ECJ - which rules on disputes involving EU legislation - found the UK had acted \"too late\" and was failing in its obligations. Judges ruled spills contributed to the deterioration of water quality in the Loughor Estuary. A Welsh Government spokesman said: \"We will continue to work with Natural Resources Wales and Dwr Cymru on a Â£113m programme to reduce the number of spills, improve water quality and reduce the risk of local flooding by 2020.\" Welsh Water added: \"We have met the legal permits for water quality in the Loughor estuary and are aware of ever increasing environmental standards and the need to manage long-term challenges, such as climate change, in a truly sustainable away.\" The UK Government said all sites in England included in the judgement \"now comply with the directive and plans are in place elsewhere across the UK to deliver compliance by 2020 at the latest\".",

The former England playmaker was dropped at Cas for three games in March after an \"internal investigation\". Chase has swapped table toppers Castleford for bottom-of-the-table Widnes, who have won twice in 13 games. \"It is a great signing for us and I'm excited we've managed to pick up someone of Rangi's quality to come into the side,\" Betts told BBC Radio Merseyside. \"I know he's excited about playing as he wants to be playing regularly - he wants to start games and play 80 minutes. \"He comes here, he's got a clean slate and he wants to go again. \"He's up for the challenge as he knows we've got our backs against the wall, he knows the situation and he's been told that.

    "He is approaching the end of his 10th year in charge and thinks it is the right time to seek a fresh challenge. Cricket Scotland chairman Keith Oliver said: \"There is no doubt that the governing body of cricket in Scotland is unrecognisable from where we were in 2004. \"And the credit for this must go to Roddy and his staff.\" During Smith's time as chief executive, his management team have increased from eight to 25 and turnover has quadrupled. I am delighted that I leave an organisation in good health with a growing game and after a year of exceptional on-field performances by national teams at all levels Cricket Scotland reported a rise in participation figures for players, coaches and umpires during those 10 years. And the national side have secured a place at next year's World Cup finals in Australia and New Zealand by beating Kenya in a qualifying event. Oliver, who has worked with Smith during that whole period, said: \"Back then, we could not have imagined we would have won global qualifying events, played in world cups at youth and senior level, played One Day International games in front of thousands, run a fully professional national team as well as winning numerous development awards at a European and Global level. \"I and all at Cricket Scotland wish Roddy every success in his next role.\" Cricket Scotland will start the recruitment process to find Smith's successor with the aim of having a replacement in place early in the new year. Smith said: ''I have thoroughly enjoyed my time with Cricket Scotland and it's hard to believe it has been nearly a decade. \"I am delighted that I leave an organisation in good health with a growing game and after a year of exceptional on-field performances by national teams at all levels. \"Ten years is a long time for a chief executive of a national governing body and now feels exactly the right time to move on to my next challenge. \"With a Cricket World Cup to look forward to early next year and a number of newly-appointed quality staff to work with, I am looking forward to handing over to my successor an organisation that is very well placed to succeed in the future.\" Cricket Scotland announced in June that it plans a new \"world class\" base in Stirling, relocating from Edinburgh, with a new pavilion at the home of Stirling County Cricket Club designed to host international matches.",
    "The 130m-tall (420ft) Bulford Kiwi, on Bulford Hill near Stonehenge, was carved by New Zealand troops who were stationed there. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport has made it a scheduled monument on the advice of Historic England. Kiwi soldiers played a significant role in the Battle of Messines, fought in June 1917 in Belgium. Another monument at Cannock Chase in Staffordshire, marking the same battle, has also been granted protection. The Terrain Model of Messines - a scale model of the battlefield - was made by German prisoners of war using soil, concrete, bricks and pebbles. The model was a popular tourist attraction at the end of the war, but it became neglected and was lost until it was recently excavated. It has now been covered over again to protect it from damage and erosion. Roger Bowdler from Historic England said: \"These two monuments pay tribute to the bravery of New Zealand's fighting forces in the First World War and we are delighted that they are now being protected for the future. \"The Bulford Kiwi was cut into the chalk at the end of the war by Kiwi soldiers themselves, to mark the presence of their forces in England, and their achievements at the front. \"The taking of the Messines ridge was one of the war's most stirring attacks, and this model lay-out remains as testimony to the planning which made possible the victory. \"Like so much of our historic environment, these lasting reminders enable us to connect with lives and events from the past that made us who we are as a nation. \"One hundred years on, it is right to remember New Zealand's valour.\" Sir Jerry Mateparae, New Zealand High Commissioner to the UK said: \"It's fantastic to see Historic England protecting two very significant sites of huge importance for New Zealand. \"The special connections that were forged 100 years ago, with communities in the UK where New Zealanders trained, are still strong today and it's moving to see these sites protected for generations to come.\"",

    "Figures show that for those aged 65, men can expect to live for another 19 years and women a further 21 years. But there is concern that too many elderly people are living in poor health. And the figures vary across the country, with the North East and North West having lower life expectancies for 65-year-olds than other regions. Life expectancy among older age groups in England rose to its highest level in 2014 - with male life expectancy increasing by 0.3 years at age 65 and 0.2 years at ages 75, 85 and 95 since 2013. Female life expectancy increased by the same amounts at the same ages. This comes after a fall in life expectancy in some older age groups between 2011 and 2012. The only region where male and female life expectancy did not increase in 2014 was in the North East, where male life expectancy was higher in 2013. Among local authorities in England, the majority showed an increase or no change in life expectancy at age 65 - but one quarter showed a decrease. In the past, statistics have tended to focus on life expectancy at birth but now that most deaths in England occur in people over the age of 80, patterns of mortality in older age groups are becoming more important. Prof John Newton, chief knowledge officer at Public Health England, said the report presented a positive national picture that made achieving \"a good quality of life in later years even more important\". \"This report is an opportunity to remind people that, even during mid-life, it is not too late to improve your health,\" he said. \"Most of us could make changes today, like stopping smoking, being more active or eating better, that would allow us to look forward to healthier later years.\" He said it was not clear what had caused the variation in trends between local areas. Danny Dorling, professor of human geography at the University of Oxford, said there was an urgent need to find out why improvements had stalled in many parts of England in recent years. \"Beneath the headline figures of this report, there is evidence of worsening health for many older people in some parts of the country,\" he said. In Scotland, life expectancy continued to improve, with 65-year-old men expected to live for a further 17.4 years and women a further 19.7 years, according to the latest statistics. But there are also wide variations across the country.",

    "Glasgow City Council said it planned to put up the tax by 3% after the national council tax freeze ended this year. Council leader Frank McAveety said while the increase would raise more than £7m, the council faced a budget gap of £67m. Most councils have yet to confirm plans, with about a third indicating they may propose a 3% increase. Further details of Glasgow's budget proposals are expected later. Mr McAveety said: \"Raising Council Tax will support frontline services while protecting the most vulnerable in our city. \"One-in-four households will not pay a penny more - and we can avoid around £7m of the most difficult cuts, which would otherwise hit every community across the city.\" The average bill in the city - in the Band D category - is £1,213, compared to the national average of £1,149. All other bills are a set proportion of this figure. But changes this year mean those in bands E, F, G and H properties will automatically pay more - even before the 3% across-the-board rise is factored in. Increases are due to take effect just weeks before May's council elections. BBC Scotland's local government correspondent Jamie McIvor said: \"Inevitably, close attention will be paid to decisions taken by councils in the west of Scotland where the SNP is hoping to make big inroads into Labour's council powerbase. \"Privately, some Labour councillors believe they are caught between a rock and a hard place. \"They argue a rise in council tax would merely limit cuts rather than end them, so they would risk asking voters to 'pay more and get less'. \"However, they also believe that if they did not raise the council tax, they would be accused of failing to use the means at their disposal to at least attempt to mitigate cuts.\" Labour-run South Lanarkshire has said it plans to freeze bills this year but the leader of West Dunbartonshire Council has indicated a rise is likely. There have been no public declarations yet from Labour-run Inverclyde, Renfrewshire, East Renfrewshire, North Ayrshire, East Dunbartonshire and North Lanarkshire. The Scottish government has said more money would be available in the coming financial year for local services across Scotland.

    "Mr Besigye was the main challenger to President Yoweri Museveni in the country's recent general election, which Mr Museveni won by a landslide. He insists he was the rightful winner of the polls, but Uganda's top court upheld the official result. \"We have been informed by police today that Besigye appeared in court in Moroto and was charged with treason,\" said his lawyer Erias Lukwago. Mr Besigye was arrested on Wednesday in downtown Kampala and flown to Moroto, where he has been in custody ever since. It follows a series of arrests of the opposition leader during the election campaign. Meanwhile, Mr Museveni was sworn in on Thursday for his fifth elective term, extending his 30-year rule of Uganda. Foreign observers said the poll had been marred by fear and intimidation. In a BBC interview, Mr Museveni rejected allegations of vote rigging, and accused Mr Besigye of planning to incite violence. Responding to criticism from European Union observers that the electoral commission \"lacked independence and transparency\", Mr Museveni told the BBC's Zuhura Yunus that \"those Europeans are not serious\". \"Transparency is what we've been voting for,\" he added. Mr Museveni, a key ally of the West in the campaign against militant Islamists in the region, seized power in 1986 and is credited with restoring stability to Uganda.

    "Prosecutors accuse Fifa president Sepp Blatter of making a \"disloyal payment\" of $2m (Â£1.6m) to Mr Platini. Mr Platini has provided information to the investigation but said he did so as a witness. Both men deny any wrongdoing. Mr Platini has said he is still determined to run for Fifa president once Mr Blatter steps down. Asked whether criminal proceedings had been opened against him, Mr Platini said: \"Absolutely not. I was heard last week by the Swiss Authorities only as a person providing information and I cooperated fully.\" But this was contradicted by the Swiss attorney general, Michael Lauber, who said: \"We didn't interview Mr Platini as a witness, that's not true. We investigated against him in between as a witness and an accused person.\" Mr Lauber also said he was prepared to search the Uefa headquarters as part of the investigation. The allegations centre on a payment made to Mr Platini in 2011 at Fifa's expense for work he completed almost a decade earlier. It came just two months before Uefa gave its backing to Blatter's 2011 presidential campaign, leading some to question the timing of it. Mr Platini said he was told when starting the work that Fifa would not be able to pay him all the money because of its \"financial situation\". But Fifa accounts show a revenue surplus of around $83m (Â£55m) from 1999-2002, when Mr Platini undertook the work as a technical adviser. Fifa was thrown into turmoil this year when the US and Swiss authorities launched separate investigations into corruption at the body. Mr Blatter is also suspected of signing a contract that was \"unfavourable to Fifa\". He is due to stand down next year, but says he will carry on in the role despite the criminal proceedings.",

I'm buzzing.\" Higgins won all three sessions against Wilson, the world number 16, and believes his game has grown in strength over the course of the tournament. The Scot considers reigning champion Mark Selby as the favourite for the title, while his pre-competition tip was Hawkins. Yet Higgins is in a good place mentally as he prepares for the semi-final. \"The nerves get more difficult, but I'm more relaxed this year,\" he said. Media playback is not supported on this device \"I don't know if that's because I feel as if I'm playing OK. At this event, you need to have a few sessions when you have good, frame-winning breaks.

I feel as if my game can be there to do that but I'm sure other players will say the same thing. \"There are some sessions, especially this year, when I couldn't have played any better. I played [Ronnie] O'Sullivan in the final of the Champions and couldn't have played any better.

Mr Richard, a US citizen who lives in Islington, north London, says the sex was consensual and that he \"reasonably believed\" the girl was over 16. He gave a total of Â£480 to the teenager and her friend, which he says was for \"travel expenses\". Prosecutor Gino Connor told the jury how Mr Richard met the girl through a US website where he listed his profile as a \"sugar daddy\", while 13-year-old called herself a \"sugar baby\". During an iChat exchange retrieved from his laptop, the defendant asked her for a \"revealing\" photograph on her hands and knees. \"You are my new daddy I will do anything to keep you happy,\" the girl replied. They arranged to meet and Mr Richard made a payment of Â£120 through PayPal, the court heard. The girls travelled to Liverpool Street station on the morning of 2 January, where they met Mr Richard in a nearby cafe. He asked their ages and they told him they were 16 and 17, the court heard.

The 21-year-old looked comfortable in the semi-finals, producing a burst of speed down the back straight to move to the front of the pack and take the line two metres clear of her rivals. \"In 800m you need to be able to run a fast race, and you need to be able to win a tactical slow race,\" explained Mutola, who is in London to fine-tune Semenya's preparations. \"You [need to] combine those two things - so if the race is slow you can win anyway and if the race is fast then it's even better, [as in] the final they'll have to dip under two minutes. \"Since I've got here I've focused more on my athlete Caster Semenya as I know she has to do well, so I'm just enjoying being a coach for the first time.\" Semenya became global news when she was asked to take a gender test by athletics' governing body the International Association of Athletics Federations in the aftermath of winning her world title. Doubts were raised over her gender because of her muscular physique, running style and sudden improvement in times. Semenya was suspended for 11 months by the IAAF but was cleared to return to the track in July 2010. She won silver at last year's World Championships in Daegu despite a back problem.",
    "According to AP, the lawsuits accuse them of serious safety lapses. Rashad Charjuan Owens has been in jail on murder charges since March after four people died when his car broke through a barrier at the music, film and interactive festival. The crash, which happened outside the Mohawk venue, also injured 23 people. Among several wrongful deaths lawsuits was one from the family of Steven Craenmehr, a Dutch music executive, who was knocked off his bike. His widow and mother claim that SXSW organisers didn't put enough traffic safeguards on the roads for pedestrians during the event, which sees thousands of bands performing at venues across Austin. \"A festival organiser or traffic design consultant of ordinary intelligence would have anticipated the danger,\" the lawsuit says. Lawyers for SXSW released a statement which read: \"What happened on Red River was a terrible tragedy, caused by Rashad Owen's utter disregard of human life. \"Our hearts continue to ache for those injured and the families of those who lost their lives. \"We look forward to his prosecution for his awful crimes.\" Authorities say that Owens drove his grey Honda Civic through a barricade after an officer on a drink-drive patrol tried stopping the car. According to police, his blood alcohol level was .114, above Texas' legal driving limit of .08. In September, a SXSW safety report found that alcohol consumption and overcrowded venues during the event had left Austin facing a \"critical point where public safety could be compromised\" if changes are not made. Organisers called the report incomplete and said it failed to address root issues. SXSW is known as one of the world's best platforms for rising music talent.

It also plans to increase the ethylene capacity of its crackers at Grangemouth in Scotland and Rafnes in Norway. Both rely on fracked shale gas being shipped across to Europe from the US. Ethylene and propylene are key building blocks in the manufacture of plastics. In a statement, Ineos said its investment would boost the amount of ethylene it can produce at each plant in Grangemouth and Rafnes by about 50%, to more than one million tonnes.

    "His departure was said to be one recommendation of a report  by former US Attorney-General Eric Holder about the company's culture and practices. Uber said the board had voted unanimously to adopt all the report's recommendations. However, its contents will not be released until Tuesday. Mr Holder was asked to undertake the review in February after former Uber engineer Susan Fowler made claims of sexual harassment. The Financial Times reported that neither Uber nor Mr Michael would comment on whether he had resigned or been fired. James Cakmak, an analyst at Monness Crespi Hardt, said Mr Michael's departure reflected Uber's need for a \"fall guy\" and could help protect Mr Kalanick. \"If Kalanick did leave, we think it would be very difficult for him to come back,\" Mr Cakmak told Bloomberg. It is possible Mr Kalanick could be forced to take a leave of absence or have his role altered. That issue was on the agenda at a seven-hour board meeting held in Los Angeles on Sunday. Mr Kalanick has been on bereavement leave following the death of his mother in a boating accident. An Uber insider said the recommendations in Mr Holder's report include introducing more control on spending, human resources and other areas where executives led by Mr Kalanick have had an unusual degree of autonomy for a company of Uber's size. The San Francisco-based ride-hailing service has more than 12,000 employees. Mr Kalanick has earned a reputation as an abrasive leader and was criticised earlier this year after being caught on video berating an Uber driver. He said in response to the video: \"I must fundamentally change as a leader and grow up.\" Uber board member Arianna Huffington has said Mr Kalanick needed to change his leadership style from that of a \"scrappy entrepreneur\" to be more like a \"leader of a major global company\". One Uber investor said the board's decisions were a step in the right direction, giving the firm an \"opportunity to reboot\". Jan Dawson, an analyst with Jackdaw Research, said: \"This week we finally learn just how committed Travis Kalanick and the rest of the senior leadership team at Uber is  to meaningful cultural change.\" Last week Uber said it fired 20 staff after another law firm examined more than 200 cases including complaints about sexual harassment, discrimination and bullying. As part of its attempt to draw a line under its recent problems, Uber said it had appointed Wan Ling Martello, a Nestle executive and Alibaba board member, as an independent director. She is the third high-profile female appointment to the company in the past week. Uber, which is still privately owned with voting control resting with Mr Kalanick and his two board allies, is valued at about $68bn. Although revenues hit $6.5bn last year, it is yet to make a profit.",

The bridge had been blamed for nearly wrecking a nearby grade I-listed church during the January 2014 floods. Dorset County Council, which has worked with the Environment Agency on the project, said the replacement bridge would \"reflect the character\" of the existing bridge, and would use \"as many of the original bricks as possible\".

Officers asked him to provide a breath test and he gave an alcohol reading of 78mg - the legal limit is 22. At Glasgow Sheriff Court, McGregor was also fined Â£500. Sheriff Neil Mackinnon disqualified McGregor for 12 months, although he may get a reduction if he successfully completes a drink driving course. Last August, McGregor was banned from driving for four months and fined Â£400 after being caught driving at 69mph in a 50mph zone. The court opted to impose a four-month ban instead of a heavier penalty and left him with nine points on his licence. He was convicted at Hamilton Justice of the Peace Court after claiming the speed gun was faulty.

    "The Supreme Court's decision to uphold the death penalty of Pakistani national Mohammad Ajmal Amir Qasab, the sole surviving gunman of the 2008 attacks on Mumbai, has opened the debate once again. Predictably, the main opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has been quick to demand Qasab's swift execution \"as those who wage war against the country and kill innocents deserve no mercy\". Qasab can still appeal to the highest court to review the verdict; and his last hope lies with a plea for clemency to the president. His appalling crime of gunning down innocents surely qualifies as a \"rarest of the rare crime\", a condition for handing out the death penalty in India. But, as critics of capital punishment say, there's no evidence to show that the death penalty deters crime. Two-thirds of the world's countries have done away with the death penalty in law or in practice. Last year, according to Amnesty International, death sentences were imposed in 63 countries, but only 21 countries actually carried out executions. India has shied away from executing people for many years now. There have been only two hangings in the country in the past 12 years and the majority of convicts on death row can expect their sentences to be commuted to life. Former president Pratibha Patil commuted the death sentences of 35 convicts midway through her five-year term. Clemency pleas of 29 prisoners on death row in India are pending before the president. They include Afzal Guru, who was convicted for carrying out an attack on the Indian parliament in December 2001. The Supreme Court upheld his death sentence as long ago as 2004. Then there is a serious practical problem: there are only one or two hangmen available in India. Two years ago, I met one in a Calcutta prison who had been employed as a hangman-cum-sweeper, and was still waiting to carry out his first execution. Recently, 14 retired Indian judges wrote to the president asking him to commute the death sentences of 13 inmates being held in prisons across the country. And the Supreme Court itself recently admitted that some death penalties it had upheld were erroneous. \"Public opinion in India can no longer ignore the global movement in favour of abolition of the death penalty,\" says AP Shah, the former chief justice of the Delhi High Court in an interview in today's The Times of India.

    "An operation to pump 3,000 tonnes of water out of the Hoegh Osaka is expected to last until Sunday. But poor weather conditions has made it unsafe for the salvors to board on Saturday to finalise pumping arrangements. High winds of up to 83mph during the night caused the vessel to drag anchor for approximately 100 metres. The ship had been anchored to help control its movement. Salvage company Svitzer described working conditions on board as \"difficult\". The Hoegh Osaka has been secured two miles (3.2km) east of the Bramble Bank sandbank from which it freed itself on Wednesday. Water, described as being \"lightly contaminated with oil\" is being pumped from the ship's hold, which salvers say will cause the ship's 50-degree list to decrease. The film of oil on the water is believed to have come from vehicles held within the hold. With no power from the ship's generators, the water is being discharged using portable pumps during daylight hours. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) said there was no evidence of any pollution. Divers are also waiting until conditions improve to complete an inspection of the hull which began yesterday. The Queen's Harbour Master has introduced an exclusion zone of 984ft (300m) around the vessel, currently held by tugs between Cowes and Lee-on-Solent. Speaking at a press conference on Thursday, Hugh Shaw, the Secretary of State's representative for maritime salvage and intervention, said: \"I've got confidence the salvors can discharge the bulk of the water from sucking underneath the oil and that will leave us with a small quantity of oil on board the vessel.\" The 51,000-tonne vehicle transporter \"refloated\" itself unexpectedly at 14:00 GMT on Wednesday due to the high tide. It was towed two miles east of Bramble Bank, where it was grounded on Saturday. At a news conference on Tuesday, Bram Sperling of Svitzer, said there was some water inside because of a \"small opening in the vessel\" that had since been closed. A refloat was the preferred option to avoid further damage to the ship from the sandbank. Salvage experts boarded the ship on Monday and began carrying out an assessment to form a rescue plan. The Singapore-registered transporter set sail for Germany at about 20:20 on Saturday, shortly before being deliberately run aground by the crew after it unexpectedly started to list. There were 1,400 cars on board, including 1,200 Jaguar and Land Rover vehicles and 65 Minis, as well as 105 JCB machines and 500 tonnes of fuel. Two crew members out of 25 rescued by RNLI Lifeboats and the Solent Coastguard on Saturday suffered non-life threatening injuries.

The FBI has never named the security firm or group of hackers who helped unlock the phone, which was used by killer Syed Rizwan Farook.

In February, a court order demanded that Apple help unlock the phone, something which Apple resisted, saying it was unable to do so. It added that it hoped that the government would share with the company any vulnerabilities of the iPhone that might come to light. There was speculation that the FBI paid at least $1.3m (Â£1.05m) to break into the phone, based on calculations following comments by FBI director James Comey who said that the agency had paid more to get into the phone than he \"will make in the remaining seven years\" in his post.

    "This follows earlier warnings that the reef was experiencing its worst coral bleaching event on record. Prof Terry Hughes from the National Coral Bleaching Taskforce told the BBC the link between bleaching and global warming was \"very well established\". Rising water temperatures cause corals to drive out colour-giving algae. The corals can die if conditions do not return to normal. In pictures: Great Barrier Reef Vinegar could help save Barrier Reef The taskforce's survey shows that the extent of the damage is most severe in the northern section of the 2,300km (1,429 mile)-long reef, which lies off the coast of Queensland state. Only 7% of the reef showed no signs of bleaching, Prof Hughes said. The effects of El Nino, as well as climate change, are being blamed for the rise in sea temperatures that causes the bleaching. More than 900 individual reefs were surveyed using a light plane and a helicopter, with the accuracy of the aerial survey then checked by teams of scuba divers. \"I'm inherently an optimist, but I think we have a rapidly narrowing window of opportunity to save the Great Barrier Reef,\" Prof Hughes said. \"If we don't take action on global warming it will become more degraded. \"After three bleaching events the mix of coral species has already changed.\" This bleaching event is far more severe than previous bleaching events recorded in 2002 and 1998, he said. \"We know that this time only 7% of the reef didn't bleach. It was closer to 40% in the other two events. \"If these events start coming as frequently as every five to 10 years there will not be sufficient coral regeneration,\" he said. Tourism to the Great Barrier Reef generates $A5bn ($3.9b, Â£2.7bn) each year and employs around 70,000 people, the National Coral Bleaching Taskforce said. \"Thankfully many parts of the reef are still in excellent shape,\" said Daniel Gschwind, chief executive of the Queensland Tourism Industry Council in a statement. \"But we can't just ignore coral bleaching and hope for a swift recovery.\" The current worldwide bleaching event, which is also affecting reefs on Australia's north-west coast, is predicted to be the worst on record.

    "Greek coach Skafidas admitted nine rule violations, committed in 2011 and 2015. \"He was put into a position of trust, he abused that trust and as a result categorically destroyed a career,\" said Ukad chief executive Nicole Sapstead. Sprinter Wilson was banned for four years in 2011 after she tested positive for testosterone and clenbuterol. The 31-year-old tested positive for clomiphene in an out-of-competition test in February last year but her sanction was reduced to 10 months due to \"the substantial assistance\" she gave Ukad. A UK Athletics-licensed coach, Skafidas ran a training group for young athletes in Lincolnshire, but Ukad confirmed the nine violations all related to his conduct with Wilson.",
    "The Scottish capital's trams began running on Saturday, after six years of disruption and cost increases. Mr Salmond cited \"considerable public concern\" over the Â£776m project, which he said had disrupted homes and businesses in Edinburgh. The problems included a dispute between the city council and its contractor. The first minister stopped short of announcing a full public inquiry, raising concerns over the timescale, and instead decided on a \"non-statutory\" option. Speaking during first minister's questions in the Scottish Parliament, Mr Salmond said: \"I am sure that everyone in Edinburgh, and indeed all over Scotland, will be delighted to see that the Edinburgh trams are fully operational and carrying passengers. \"We cannot, however, lose sight of the considerable public concern over the conduct of the project, the disruption it has caused to households and businesses in the city of Edinburgh. \"I therefore recommended to the Cabinet, and it has been decided, to establish a judge-led public inquiry into the Edinburgh trams project to establish why the project occurred significant overruns in terms of cost and timing, requiring in particular a considerable reduction in the original scope.\" He added that the government had been assured by the City of Edinburgh Council that it would fully cooperate with the inquiry. The first minister added: \"There are lessons to be learned from the conduct of the Edinburgh trams project and I think the course of action we are proposing will be a substantial assistance in doing that.\" Mr Salmond was responding to a question from Marco Biagi, the SNP MSP for Edinburgh Central and an opponent of the city's trams, which run on an 8.7-mile route, from the New Town to Edinburgh Airport. \"All of us who opposed the trams project from the start as risky and over-engineered have been disappointed almost daily by being shown to be right,\" said Mr Biagi. \"Now that the trams are indeed rolling, if there is to be any faith from the public in future management or potential cost estimates for projects like this, we need to know for sure that these mistakes will never be repeated\". In the decade since the first money was allocated to the project, the price has doubled, the tram network has halved and it has taken twice as long to build as originally planned. Four years ago, a bitter dispute between Transport Edinburgh Limited, the arms-length company responsible for delivering the project, and main contractor Bilfinger Berger brought the whole project to a halt for months.",
    "A video was released via social media from MotoGP's Valencia Grand Prix, appearing to show the Italian colliding with the fan while riding a motorcycle. The nine-time world champion apologised for the incident and said that he hoped she was ok. Rossi, 37, added it was difficult for him to move quickly around the paddock. Fan Ana Cabanillas Vazquez told Spanish radio station COPE she would have accepted the apology if she thought it \"had been an accident\". \"Seeing the video, you can tell that it was done on purpose,\" she said. \"I have a small bruise on my leg.

    "A number of options are being considered to improve care in the north of the county, including removing consultant-led services from Whitehaven's West Cumberland Hospital. The boss of North Cumbria University Hospitals NHS Trust said it does not look like Whitehaven has the \"infrastructure\" to maintain services. Midwives have raised safety concerns. They have warned mothers and babies \"may die\" if consultant-led maternity services are removed from Whitehaven and concentrated at Carlisle Cumberland Infirmary. Trust chief executive Stephen Eames told BBC Cumbria: \"The options we are looking at are likely to mean there will be changes in maternity services and they're likely to mean we'll need to concentrate our expertise in our consultant staff in one place. \"Everybody involved would prefer a consultant-led service in both, but I think the reality is it isn't just about maternity, it's about the other clinical services that support it. \"So while we've made some improvements in children's services recruitment it doesn't look like we can recruit the infrastructure to support two independent consultant-led services.\" Midwives at Whitehaven are concerned mothers facing unexpected problems would need a potentially risky 40-mile (64km) transfer across the county. Earlier this month, Bernadette Bowness said: \"We're going to become a third world area because of our inaccessibility to a consultant-led unit. \"If ladies have to be transferred, mothers may die, babies may die. \"If babies have foetal distress, what with the transfer time they may end up brain damaged.\" A public consultation exercise will be launched next month to gauge opinion on the future direction of services provided by the trust. The organisation has been in special measures since 2014 after Care Quality Commission inspectors judged it to be failing to provide a sufficiently high level of care in a number of areas.",
    "Celtic have not lost a domestic game this season ahead of their Scottish Cup semi-final against Rangers. And Lovenkrands, 37, insists reaching the cup final in May should be all the motivation the Ibrox players need. \"I don't think it's anything to do with being the first team to beat them,\" the Dane said. \"With the Old Firm, you have to win. If you are playing for Rangers, you have to go and beat your rivals and Celtic will say the same. \"I don't think anybody would be looking at it from a Rangers point of view, that we want to be the first team to beat them this season. \"You need to approach every game to win it.\" Lovenkrands spent six years at Ibrox and scored twice, including a late winner, in the 3-2 Scottish Cup final win over Celtic at Hampden in 2002. He also scored the eventual winner in the 2-1 League Cup final defeat of Celtic at the national stadium the following year. And the former Newcastle United and Schalke player, who won 22 Denmark caps, would like to see a new Rangers hero emerge on Sunday. \"I would hope someone could come out and grab that chance,\" he explained. \"I grabbed my chance and these things happen in Old Firm games. It happens for Celtic players, like Henrik Larsson, he did fantastic scoring goals against Rangers. \"You get your chance and it is about grabbing it and hopefully someone will go and grab the headlines.\" Celtic, who have already won the Premiership title and the League Cup, are 33 points clear of Rangers in the league. The Ibrox outfit go into Sunday's match having won three games and drawn two under new manager Pedro Caixinha. \"Anything can happen in football,\" Lovenkrands added. \"I have always said it is 50-50 in an Old Firm game. \"Celtic have won the league comfortably and deservedly so. But Rangers have stepped up in the last couple of games. \"They have changed their manager and they have changed their way of playing. I like the way they have changed and the more direct approach suits the players better, they seem to be getting the results. \"But it is all about what happens on the day, a challenge after five minutes can change the whole run of the game.\"",

    "Sarah Sands, 32, killed her 77-year-old neighbour Michael Pleasted weeks after finding out he allegedly abused three boys, the Old Bailey was told. She told police that Mr Pleasted, who had been charged with sexual assaults on two children aged under 13, had been \"asking for trouble\". He was killed in his Canning Town flat on 28 November. Ms Sands denies murder. The court heard how Ms Sands armed herself with a knife after drinking two bottles of wine and a bottle of brandy. The case's prosecutor Jonathan Ree said CCTV footage showed she was in his block of flats for 20 minutes. Mr Pleasted, who was stabbed eight times, had been on bail awaiting trial. Police were also investigating an allegation he had abused a third boy. Ms Sands had befriended the pensioner who was a familiar local figure and ran a bric-a-brac shop from a Mace convenience store, the court heard. She used to visit him at his flat and bring him meals before she became aware of the abuse allegations. After the stabbing, Ms Sands went to the Isle of Dogs, putting the knife and clothes she had been wearing in a carrier bag. Before deciding to hand herself in, she told a family friend: \"I stabbed him\". During a police interview, she said she had tried to help him, while all the while he was abusing young children. She later said in a statement that she denied intending to kill Mr Pleasted or cause him serious bodily harm, claiming she went to confront him and took a knife for protection as she was scared. The trial continues.",
    "Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International released a report criticising conditions at a detention centre on the island of Nauru. The report concluded that Australia must intentionally allow abuse of detainees to deter asylum seekers. A statement from the Immigration Department criticised Amnesty for not consulting the government. \"There was no consultation with the Department of Immigration and Border Protection from Amnesty International in preparation of this report,\" the statement said. \"We strongly refute many of the allegations in the report and would encourage Amnesty International to contact the Department before airing allegations of this kind.\" The statement said Australia did not exert control over the laws of Nauru, a sovereign country. It said the Australian government welcomed independent scrutiny of its facilities. Australia transports asylum seekers who arrive by boat to off-shore processing centres in Nauru and Papua New Guinea. Read more: Why are asylum seekers so controversial in Australia? The Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch report was written after an incognito visit to Nauru last month. The organisations said Australia's actions seemed designed to discourage other migrants from attempting to get to Australia. No documentary evidence was provided in the report to support the claim. But interviews with 84 refugees and asylum seekers unearthed claims of rape and assault at the hand of Nauruan locals, inadequate medical care and cramped, uncomfortable living conditions. The detention centre at Nauru is run by a company called Broadspectrum and medical services are provided by International Health and Medical Services. Both companies have a contract with the Australian government. One woman quoted in the report said she had married a man 15 years her senior in order to feel safe on the island. Another said Nauruan men had driven her into the jungle with the intent of raping her. Although most held on the island have been identified as genuine refugees and released into the community, many felt afraid to leave their accommodations, particularly at night, the report said. The report also alleged that Nauruan police tended to downplay or ignore asylum seekers' reports of abuse.",
    "Assembly Tory leader Andrew RT Davies said although devolved, health was one of the main election issues for voters. \"Wherever you go across Wales people raise the issue of the NHS, and Labour are running the NHS in Wales,\" he said. Labour responded saying that Tory sums on the NHS \"simply don't add up\". Mr Davies said Welsh Conservatives would protect health spending and introduce a cancer drugs fund. He defended his party's decision to campaign on an area of policy that was not controlled in Wales by Westminster. \"(Labour leader) Ed Miliband has used the example of 'compare and contrast', and I think it is perfectly reasonable to point out we don't have a cancer drugs fund here in Wales and some of the most disappointing ambulance response times on record,\" he said. \"There is a real dilemma for voters in May. Do they want to vote for the Conservative party who want to protect health spending or do they endorse a party who have drastically cut health provision in Wales?\" But Welsh Labour's Deputy Health Minister Vaughan Gething accused the Conservatives of wanting to privatise the NHS. \"The Tories have had three opportunities in the campaign so far to rule out privatising the NHS and they have refused to do so\" he said. He added: \"This election is a clear choice between a Labour government that would invest in the NHS to train an extra 1000 doctors, nurses and front-line staff, or a Tory government that would introduce a tablet tax for sick people and privatise health services.\" Elsewhere on the campaign trail on Monday, Welsh Lib Dem leader Kirsty Williams was promising better rural health care while visiting target seats in mid Wales. Ms Williams said her party wanted to invest in cottage hospitals and community care. \"An urgent care centre in Montgomeryshire is essential if we are to relieve pressure on A&E departments and cut waiting times,\" she said. Plaid Cymru accused its rivals of neglecting the economy of north Wales.

    "Earlier this year, signs for the Clifton Village residents' parking zone appeared but some were fixed to railings which are Grade II* listed. It prompted complaints that the signs were spoiling a conservation area. The council said it used railings as much as possible to minimise posts in the pavement. It said it \"met regularly\" with English Heritage to talk about listed building work and legislation. The council said when signs were put up in the Kingsdown conservation area it was advised as long as it was not making \"significant or permanent changes to a building, which would alter its character, it was acceptable\". English Heritage's letter, seen by the BBC, raised the \"potential cumulative impact\" of the signs in West Mall and Caledonia Place, which contains listed buildings. \"We would suggest that taken together such work might fall within Section 7 of the [Planning and Listed Buildings and Conservation 1990] Act,\" it said. \"In our view, it would be prudent to seek a listed building consent... to allow for a careful consideration of the impact of the works on the special interest of the terrace, of the number of signs and the consideration of alternative locations.\" Numbers one to 31 Caledonia Place and their attached basement railings are Grade II* listed by English Heritage for their \"special architectural or historic interest\".",
    "Civil protection officials have already revealed that rescuers were let down by the Siresp emergency services network during the four-day disaster. Now details have emerged of pleas for help that did not get through to commanders on the ground. The government has ordered an investigation into the network. The fire began in the Pedrógão Grande area during the afternoon on 17 June and within hours the failures of the emergency network, which relies on mobile antennas, were becoming clear. The first failure came at 19:45 on 17 June. Three people dialled the 112 emergency number from an abandoned house in nearby Casalinho to report that the building was surrounded by flames. Emergency services tried to contact the local command post and the deputy commander but were unable to get through, according to a civil protection authority (ANPC) timeline, described by Portuguese media as a \"black box\". Five minutes later, officials were unable to contact a command post to help a father and son in trouble a few kilometres away in Troviscais. These and several other cases are documented throughout the night by the Público and Jornal de Notícias websites. At 01:02 on 18 June comes the most chilling entry on the civil protection authority's log, in a reference to the deaths of 47 people on a single stretch of the N-236 road. Thirty of the victims died in their cars. A district relief operations command appeals for help in tackling \"breakdowns in the Siresp network\" and for \"lifting the dead victims who are in the road, making it impossible for combat means to get through\". The civil protection authority has already confirmed \"failures in the Siresp network\" that continued throughout the four-day emergency and on the Saturday evening, firefighters resorted to using their old radio network. The government on Monday said it had asked for a study into Siresp's operation, particularly during serious accidents and disasters. Prime Minister Antonio Costa said last week that the network had suffered because cables and communication towers had been damaged by the fire. However, he said the mobile network had provided temporary mobile antennas. The forest fires were the worst in Portugal's history, with 64 dead and 254 injured. Portugal's Siresp (joint emergency and security network system) has had a chequered past. It was set up in 2006 as a partnership between the government and private sector. The system stopped working during a rescue attempt in storms in January 2013 and it was linked to the deaths of two firefighters a few months later.",

Blatter, 79, and vice-president Michel Platini have both been suspended for 90 days amid corruption allegations, which both men deny. Platini is seeking the next presidency, as is Prince Ali bin al-Hussein. Frenchman Platini, president of European football's governing body Uefa, submitted his candidacy papers earlier this month, but Fifa says it cannot recognise his candidacy while his ban is in place and he cannot campaign. However, Fifa's electoral committee says it may allow him to stand if his suspension ends before the election date. Shaikh Salman bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa of Bahrain is expected to contest the election. Former Trinidad and Tobago midfielder David Nakhid said he will stand, while ex-Tottenham defender Ramon Vega is considering doing likewise. South Korean Chung Mong-joon, another confirmed candidate, claimed his campaign has been \"sabotaged\" by a six-year ban from Fifa's ethics committee. On Tuesday, the 64-year-old's bid to lift the ban was rejected a Zurich district court. Swiss Blatter is under criminal investigation over claims he made a £1.35m payment to Platini in 2011, as well as allegations he signed a contract \"unfavourable\" to Fifa. Fifa's reform committee also made a number of recommendations for the governing body to make changes to \"improve efficiency, prevent fraud and conflicts of interest and increase transparency in the organisation\".

    "Announcing his decision, Dane County District Attorney Ishmael Ozanne said police officer Matt Kenny had been attacked and feared for his life. Nineteen-year-old Tony Robinson Jr, who was mixed race and unarmed, was shot on 6 March in a Madison apartment. His death sparked protests in the state capitol building, one of a series of US police shootings to raise tensions. More protesters with banners saying \"Black lives matter\" gathered in Madison after the attorney made his announcement on Tuesday. Mr Robinson's mother, Andrea Irwin, vowed to continue the \"fight\" as she addressed a crowd of supporters outside Grace Episcopal Church. Earlier, Mr Ozanne had said: \"This tragic and unfortunate death was the result of a lawful use of deadly police force and no charges should be brought against Kenny.\" Officer Kenny was responding to an emergency call about a man obstructing traffic who had allegedly been involved in an assault, when he confronted Robinson. On the night of the shooting, Robinson had various illicit drugs in his system, according to autopsy reports. His friends who made multiple 911 calls said he was \"acting crazy\" and tried to choke one of them. They said he attacked people on the sidewalk and was running in front of cars, Mr Ozanne said. Mr Kenny drew his firearm before entering the apartment building Robinson was in and he claims he was attacked by Robinson at the top of the stairs. He said he feared he would be knocked down the stairs and Robinson would take his gun, and he fired seven shots at him. But Mr Robinson's relatives, and many of the Wisconsin protesters, insist he is a victim of police brutality. \"My decision won't bring him back, it will not end the racial disparities that exist in justice system,\" said Mr Ozanne. \"It is not based on emotion, rather the facts as they have been investigated and reported to me, guided by the rule of law.\"",
    "The list of 198 firms owed a total of £466,219 in arrears and included football clubs, recruitment firms, care homes and hairdressers. Top of the list was a London restaurant which owed almost £100,000 to 30 employees. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said all the money owed had been paid back to workers. The list was the largest of its kind since the \"naming and shaming\" scheme was introduced in October 2013. The department said 688 employers in total have been publicly identified for flouting the law, with total arrears of more than £3.5m. Business Minister Margot James said: \"It is not acceptable that some employers fail to pay at least the minimum wage their workers are entitled to. \"So we'll continue to crack down on those who ignore the law, including by naming and shaming them.\" Restaurant San Lorenzo in Wimbledon, South West London, owed £99,541.98 to 30 workers, while Premier Recruitment Ltd in Derby owed £34,797.33 to 424 workers. Also on the list were football clubs Blackpool FC and Brighton and Hove Albion, which owed £2,861.64 to one worker. Brighton and Hove Albion said its reputation had been \"unfairly tarnished\" by its inclusion on the list, claiming the case was a \"minor administrative error\" which resulted from being \"over generous\" in paying expenses to someone on work experience two years ago. A spokesman for the club insisted: \"We are one of the few clubs who pays its staff over and above the National Living Wage.\" TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady called for the \"worst offenders\" to be prosecuted, adding: \"Bosses who try to duck the minimum wage must have nowhere to hide. \"The level of underpayment in some cases is truly eye-watering.\" The list comes after the new National Living Wage was introduced in April, requiring employers to pay at least £7.20 an hour to employees aged 25 and over. However, the Living Wage Foundation calculates that a rate of £8.25 per hour is required to meet the cost of living, rising to £9.40 in London. Some employers pay this higher living wage voluntarily. The National Living Wage of £6.70 an hour applies to workers aged 21 to 24, with lower rates for younger people and apprentices. The government's list includes firms that have failed to pay either the minimum wage or the National Living Wage. Conor D'Arcy from think tank the Resolution Foundation backed the government's policy of naming and shaming but added: \"With the number of people on the wage floor set to treble over the next four years, the government will need to strengthen its resources for enforcing both the national minimum wage and the national living wage.\" Green Party peer Baroness Jones said: \"The government must introduce a real Living Wage, calculated by the actual cost of living, as called for by the Living Wage Foundation and the Green Party, among others. \"This is the only way to ensure people can afford to live in Britain today.\"",

    "Thousands of the furry insects, with a wing span of up to 16cm (6in), interrupted a semi-finals match at the Darul Makmur Stadium last week. Over 800 sightings were also reported in neighbouring Singapore last month, sparking intense online debate. The Lyssa Zampa tropical moth, which is also known as the Laos brown butterfly, is native to South East Asia. Biology lecturer N Sivasothi said that while the moth sightings appear to be \"unprecedented\", it is not a new phenomenon. \"The moths are actually present during other times of the year but in very small numbers, so they are usually not noticed by people,\" Mr Sivasothi said, adding that the creatures typically emerge between April and August every year. Ecologist Anuj Jain said moths' use of light for navigation often causes them to head to built-up areas. \"Their tendency to emigrate in search of new uneaten host plants attracts these moths to light in urban city areas,\" he said. Experts said that while people suffering from asthma may be sensitive to hairs on their wings, the nocturnal creatures do not pose any threat. \"The moths are harmless and the public has nothing to be afraid of,\" said Lena Chan, Director of the National Biodiversity Centre at the National Parks Board in Singapore. \"There is no need for people to protect themselves against these moths as they do not cause any allergies or diseases. In fact, they are important pollinators and are beautiful to watch.\" Many Malaysians and Singaporeans however, took to the internet to share their moth encounters and to upload photographs of the winged creatures. Although many seemed to welcome the arrival of the furry insects, others remained cautious. \"In China, moths are viewed as symbols of death as they represent the souls of deceased loved ones,\" said Chinese astrologer Cindy Wu. \"It is therefore considered a serious taboo to kill moths or disturb them.\"",
    "This is according to a study revealing that 96% of the chicks are dying at two to three weeks old. Conservationists say that human activity has driven the birds to one remaining wetland, but that that site has insufficient food for the ducks. The research is published in the journal Bird Conservation International. The Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust (WWT), which led the research, estimates that only 25 individual birds now remain in the wild. Human activity, including deforestation, farming and fishing, has destroyed their habitat to the point that this last population is now restricted to one wetland in north-east Madagascar - a complex of lakes near Bemanevika. After the rediscovery of the species at this site in 2006, the WWT and its partners, including the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust and the Peregrine Fund, set up a conservation breeding programme and began to monitor the wild birds. Dr Geoff Hilton, head of species research at the WWT, said that with such a small number of birds, keeping a close eye on the population was straightforward. \"We had about 10 or 11 females, [and] we were able to tell that most of those females were laying eggs, and those eggs were hatching,\" he told BBC News. But at the point when the ducklings were two to three weeks old, they would start disappearing. Piecing the evidence together, including samples of food from the bottom of the lake, the researchers realised that the chicks were starving to death. These diving ducks feed from the bottom of lakes, and this steep crater lake was simply too deep for them. WWT senior research officer Dr Andrew Bamford, who led the study, said: \"The last refuge of the Madagascar pochard is one of the last unspoilt wetlands in the country, but it's simply not suited to its needs. \"Something similar happened in the UK when the lowland red kite became confined to upland Wales, and in Hawaii, where the last nenes survived only on the upper slopes of volcanoes because introduced predators had occupied their favoured grassland habitats.\" Dr Hilton added: \"What we think we're seeing is a bit of a classic wildlife conservation conundrum. \"The place where the species hangs on at the end is not a particularly good place for them - it's just the place that's been least badly affected by human activities.\" But the researchers say the species could thrive in Madagascar again if the captive-bred ducks can be found a new wetland home. \"We have been very successful in establishing a captive population,\" said Dr Hilton. \"And we have recently identified a lake that we think has potential to be restored and become a reintroduction site. \"The main thing we have to do is work with the local people to reintroduce and restore the pochard, but also to restore the lake and help people to get a better livelihood from the lake they live around.\" Follow Victoria on Twitter",
    "The new week-long round-robin competition aims to give more T20 tournament experience to the eight associate countries involved. Ireland's second game will be against Namibia in Abu Dhabi on 17 January before they face hosts the United Arab Emirates a day later in Dubai. The tournament's semi-finals and final will take place in Dubai on 20 January. Experienced internationals Boyd Rankin, Stuart Thompson and Andrew Balbirnie return to the Ireland squad for the tournament. Rankin (broken leg), Balbirnie (hip) and Thompson (performance anxiety) missed most of Ireland's 2016 campaign. Niall O'Brien has been left out of the squad with the Ireland selectors opting to take Gary Wilson as the only wicket-keeper while Middlesex seamer Tim Murtagh is also omitted. Jacob Mulder and Little retain their places in the T20 squad following their debuts in the format against Hong Kong, and Greg Thompson's impressive return in that game after an eight-year absence also sees him make the tour.

    "Hywel Dda University Health Board wants to reduce the hours of the paediatric ambulatory care unit (PACU) at Withybush Hospital by four hours a day. It is making a recommendation in response to there being \"fewer consultant paediatricians available.\" The plans will be discussed at a full health board meeting on 24 November. The PACU cares for children who experience sudden pain, high temperatures, sickness, infections, or requirements for dressings, blood tests, x-rays or scans. If the recommendation is accepted, it would mean the PACU would be open daily from 10:00 to 1800 GMT instead of 10:00 to 22:00. Sick children who require assessment after the new closing time would be referred or transferred by ambulance to Glangwili Hospital in Carmarthen. The health board said the move to reduce hours in the short term was the result of \"longstanding difficulties in recruiting paediatric consultants across the UK\". This coincided with the retirement of a Pembrokeshire paediatric consultant and the maternity leave of another. The health board said to do nothing would be a \"risk.\" There is also a recommendation to merge the on-call rota with the one operating in Carmarthenshire. This means that if there was a paediatric out-of-hours emergency at Withybush Hospital, the on-call paediatric consultants would offer remote advice. The health board's chief executive Steve Moore said: \"It is our duty to be realistic about the availability of our consultants and to plan care around this so that it is safe, consistent and to avoid public confusion. \"Otherwise, we risk the event of having insufficient staff and having to close the unit in an unplanned and uncoordinated way, risking patient safety and public confidence.\" He added that the health board's recruitment efforts are continuing.",

    "Mrs Foster said on Wednesday that she wanted to better understand those who love the language. She said she wanted to \"listen to and engage with those from the Gaelic Irish background, those without the party political background\". Mr Ó Muilleoir said he hoped the meeting would happen soon. \"It's a positive move,\" he said. \"Anything that encourages dialogue, that encourages conversations, that encourages increased understanding has to be positive.\" Stormont's parties have \"paused\" talks to strike a deal to form an executive until after Easter. The parties have yet to find a deal almost six weeks after the assembly election. One of Sinn Féin's key priorities in the talks is a guarantee that an Irish Language Act will be enacted. In February, Arlene Foster said the DUP would never agree to an Irish Language Act. But she has now said she would meet with \"people who genuinely love the Irish language and don't want to use it as a political weapon\". Mr Ó Muilleoir said he hoped she would listen carefully to the views of Irish speakers as they are \"united and firm on the need for an Irish Language Act\". \"I think that Arlene will find when she meets the Irish language community that they're a very broad church, people with all political views and none,\" he said. \"She'll find they're united behind the belief that Irish is a shared treasure of our people. \"It's a gift which I think Irish speakers want to share with everyone including, of course, those unionists who haven't yet completed the journey of understanding how important the Irish language is.\" He added that it is \"too early\" to judge where the DUP stands in relation to an Irish Language Act but that the meeting will \"be of benefit to her and to the Irish language community\".

    "The 32-year-old attacking midfielder has signed a two-year deal with Hull City after eight months Stateside. \"The national team weighed heavily on my mind,\" said Maloney. \"It was in March that I noticed that the travel back for the international games was proving more difficult than I thought it was going to be.\" The former Celtic, Aston Villa and Wigan player acknowledged \"it was proving difficult\" to be \"physically 100% able for training and matches\" as he looked to add to his 40 international caps. Maloney played in both of Scotland's matches in the spring, where he was subbed at half-time in the friendly against Northern Ireland and played the full 90 minutes of the 6-1 win over Gibraltar in Euro 2016 Group D qualifying. In June, he was back in Scotland for the friendly against Qatar and a few days later played a key role in Scotland's 1-1 draw in the Euro 2016 qualifier against the Republic of Ireland in Dublin. Earlier this week, he was named in the Scotland squad for next month's Euro qualifiers against Georgia in Tbilisi and Germany at Hampden. He said of his decision to leave Chicago: \"There were various reasons, a couple of them personal, but once I thought about it professionally, I still had a real desire to achieve something in British football. \"I have loved living in Chicago. I had a brilliant time. I don't think I've been happier living anywhere else. \"The football didn't work out they way we all hoped. The owner, the manager hoped for things to be different. \"I didn't want to give the national manager any excuse whenever I met up with the national team, travelling back from Chicago.\" Maloney did not speak to Scotland boss Gordon Strachan about his move to Hull, a Championship club he was keen to join with Steve Bruce as manager. He said: \"Once I made it known that I was going to come back, it was two or three weeks ago that Hull showed an interest in me. That's when a decision had to be made. \"My mind was made up pretty quickly that I wanted to play for him. Everything is geared up to get the team back into the Premier League.\" Scotland sit third behind Poland and Germany in Group D qualifying. \"We're in a good position,\" Maloney added. \"Let's hope that we're good enough to get the results needed to get us out the group and get us to a major championship.\"",

    "James Male, Andrew Bridge, Steve Warren and Paul Goslin died when Cheeki Rafiki, the yacht they were sailing, capsized in the North Atlantic. Prosecutors at Winchester Crown Court said yacht manager Douglas Innes failed to get it checked ahead of its trip. Mr Innes, of Stormforce Coaching, denies four counts of manslaughter by gross negligence. The 42-year-old, of Whitworth Crescent, Southampton, also denies a further charge of failing to ensure the vessel was operated in a safe manner. Prosecutor Nigel Lickley QC also outlined to the court how the yacht had been given a category 2 code, which meant it was only authorised to be used commercially up to 60 miles away from a \"safe haven\". The code certificate had expired shortly before the tragedy, he added. The men were returning from Antigua Sailing Week to Southampton when the vessel overturned in May 2014. The court heard that after receiving an urgent email from Andrew Bridge on board the yacht, Mr Innes, who was in a pub at the time, did not call the coastguard but instead went to another pub where Mr Bridge phoned saying the situation had worsened. Mr Innes returned home, called the coastguard and emailed the crew suggesting they check the bolts of the keel. Mr Lickley said it was a \"tragedy\" that they would eventually discover a number of bolts had failed or broken, causing the keel to detach from the yacht. He said: \"Some had failed and were broken and had been for some time,\" before the yacht left the UK in October 2013. Skipper Mr Bridge, 22, from Farnham in Surrey, Mr Male, 22, from Romsey, Hampshire, Mr Warren, 52, from Bridgwater in Somerset and Mr Goslin, 56, from West Camel in Somerset, died after the yacht lost its keel more than 700 miles from Nova Scotia in Canada. The yacht was found by a container ship on 17 May, two days after Mr Bridge's urgent email, with its life raft still on board. Mr Lickley told jurors the keel's loss would have caused a \"rapid capsize\" and the men on deck would have been \"jettisoned\" into the water while those inside would have been trapped. He added: \"What is clear from two of the emergency beacons used by Andrew Bridge and James Male is that they may have survived for some time, most probably in the water, that is until they were lost too.\" The US Coastguard was criticised for calling off its search after two days. However, following protests from family and friends, and intervention by the British government, it was restarted and the boat was discovered, the court heard. The trial continues.",
    "The 23-year-old signed from Atletico Madrid for a club record fee of £15m following Fernando's Llorente's move from Sevilla. Borja said: \"We can adapt and play with two strikers or just one, whatever the boss asks from us.\" The record signing will not play in Swansea's season opener at Burnley. Borja added on Llorente: \"We don't know each other personally but I've been told he's a really good guy. \"I'm sure we'll both work together well and do whatever's best for the team.\" Borja was born in Madrid and came through the academy at Atletico, but has spent the past five seasons on loan away from the Vicente Calderon. \"Of course there's a bit of frustration I didn't play much at Atletico,\" said Borja, who scored 18 goals last season in La Liga for Eibar. \"I grew up there, went through the ranks and wish I'd had more of an opportunity in the first team.\" Despite competition from La Liga and Premier League sides for the Spaniard's signature, Borja says his decision to join Swansea was not difficult. \"Swansea showed the most interest, they seemed to want me more than anyone else,\" he said. \"It's a great club who have a lot of confidence in their players and I really want to make a good impression here.\" Unlike 31-year-old Llorente, who was a part of his Spain's 2010 World Cup and Euro 2012-winning squads, Borja has yet to earn a senior call-up for his country. But he hopes to emulate ex-Swans striker Michu, who went on to earn a cap for his country after a prolific season with Swansea. \"Michu did a great job at Swansea which eventually earned him a place in Spain's squad,\" said Borja. \"If only I could score as many goals as he did, helping the team in every possible way, for the good of Swansea, but also to put myself in the frame for national selection too.\"",

    "The hashtag #penuriecarburantdansunfilm, which translates as \"fuel shortage in a film\", became France's top Twitter trend on Tuesday, with more than 5,000 tweets. A strike over new labour laws is now affecting all of France's eight oil refineries. An estimated 20% of petrol stations have either run dry or are low on supplies. In their posts, French social media users talk about films such as Total Recall, the title of both a 1990 and 2012 science fiction film. Total is also the name of a French multinational oil and gas company. Some users also changed film titles to reflect the shortage: Pulp Fiction was renamed Pump Friction, The Full Monty became The Fuel Monty and Mad Max: Fury Bicycle Lane replaced Mad Max: Fury Road. American actor Vin Diesel's surname and his Hollywood blockbusters attracted particular attention, with people inventing several titles for his Fast and Furious series: Last and Furious, Pas Fast Mais Furious (translation: Not Fast But Furious), Immobile and Furious and Fuel Furious. Others renamed 8 Mile, a semi-biographical drama staring US rapper Eminem, 0 Mile and 8 Miles a Pied (translation: 8 Miles on Foot). American director Stanley Kubrick appeared to inspire people who posted about Fuel Metal Jacket, referring to Kubrick's 1987 film Full Metal Jacket. 2001, l'Odyssee de l'espace is the French title of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. But Espace is also the name of minivan built by French car manufacturer Renault. Pictures of people filling jerrycans at petrol stations led people to incorporate the term into film titles. Tom and Jerrrycan, Jerrycan Beauty and Catch Me If You Jerrycan were the result. Another obvious target was Nicolas Winding Refn's 2011 film Drive which social media users changed to Walk and Drive Pas. Read more about France's controversial new labour laws",

    "Francee, the fortunate feline, was found and saved by Campbell Baird, who came to check on construction work at his new home. He only noticed the unfortunate cat after hearing \"meowing\" coming from the walls. \"I couldn't believe it at first,\" said Mr Baird. He used a drill, chisel and hammer to free Francee before posting a video of the unlikely cat rescue on Facebook in an effort to track down the owner. The video has since been shared more than 700 times and Francee has been reunited with her owner, a little shocked but uninjured from her ordeal. According to Mr Baird, the cat got stuck in a tiny cavity space after apparently clambering a ladder to the first floor. \"The only way in would have been from above so she must've climbed up and then got stuck down in between the wall. \"It's fortunate I came up to the house or the cat would not have been found. \"It was a small cavity space in the wall.

    "Shamsul Arefin brought four people from his native Bangladesh to work at the Stewart Hotel near Appin in Argyll over a three year period. His victims took out loans to pay him substantial sums for employment at the hotel. One was threatened with having his kidney removed by money lenders back home if he didn't pay his debt. Arefin's crimes were  described as a \"clear case of modern day slavery\". At Fort William Sheriff Court, he was found guilty of breaches of the Asylum and Immigration Act. He carried out the crimes between 2008 and 2010. He recruited his victims by offering them jobs as chefs at his hotel. They were told to pay him substantial sums of money which he described as a \"deposit\" in exchange for employment and a salary. On their arrival at the hotel, their wages were reduced to a fraction of the contracted amount and they were required to work far longer hours with their duties extended beyond the kitchen. The men told how they had to paint the hotel, clean rooms and cut and move logs in the hotel grounds in freezing winter temperatures. Arefin threatened his victims with termination of their employment when they complained and refused to return the money they had paid him. In one case the victim described how money lenders in Bangladesh had threatened to remove his kidney as a result of his inability to pay back what he owed. The crimes came to light following an investigation by the UK Border Agency and the then Northern Constabulary. Responding to Arefin's sentencing, Kath Harper, the Crown's national lead prosecutor for human trafficking, said: \"Arefin's greed had life-changing implications not just for his victims, but for their families and others who supported them. \"Human trafficking can come in many forms and as prosecutors we are committed to doing all we can do eradicate it from Scotland.\" Kevin Hyland, independent anti-slavery commissioner, added: \"The victims of these particular crimes endured exploitation and abuse many thought was a distant memory of the past. \"This is a clear case of 'modern day slavery' and I commend the bravery of the four men who gave evidence at the trial. I hope that receiving justice in the courts assists in their journey of recovery.\" Det Insp Richard Baird from Police Scotland said: \"Shamsul Arefin was driven by financial greed and held no regard for the working conditions of those in his employment. \"This was apparent by the poor condition that his victims were subject to through working long hours at no extra pay and often with substandard equipment and working supplies. \"In bringing this individual to justice we have disrupted, if not dismantled, one more illegal enterprise and hopefully saved other potential victims from inevitable suffering.\"",

    "The 14-time major champion, who has twice undergone surgery during 15 months out, is nine shots off the pace set by fellow American JB Holmes. Woods, 40, had four birdies in eight holes but he bogeyed the ninth after a wayward drive and poor chip. Another shot went on the 11th, while double bogeys on the 16th and 18th left the world number 898 a stroke over par. Woods said he \"felt pretty good\" and \"looking forward to the next few days\" after completing his round at the event he hosts to benefit his charitable foundation. \"I hit the ball in three bushes and the water, so it could have been something really good,\" he said on Sky Sports. \"I got off to a solid start but then I made a few mistakes. I didn't play the par fives particularly well. \"I had some awkward shots.  If you drive great you can take advantage of this golf course, but if you don't you can end up in bushes or rocks and go sideways.\" His first double bogey came after he pulled his approach to the green from the centre of the 16th fairway and was forced to chip out short of the green. He over-hit his fourth and two putted from the back edge for a six. Woods then pulled his drive on the par-four 18th into a lake and although he hit the pin with his fourth shot, he two-putted from 12 feet for the fourth six of his round. He had briefly tied for the lead at four under after a run of three birdies from the sixth hole as he played the first nine holes in three-under-par 33. And although he cancelled out his bogey on the 11th with a birdie on the 15th, his two late double bogeys blotted an otherwise encouraging round. Holmes leads the 18-man event after an eight-under-par 64 that featured seven birdies and an eagle. Japan's Hideki Matsuyama is a shot further back on seven under, with US Open winner Dustin Johnson on six under.

    "Its leader, Heinz Christian Strache, said the way postal votes were handled was among numerous irregularities. \"We are not sore losers,\" he said. \"This is about protecting the foundations of democracy.\" The party's candidate was defeated by the former Green Party leader by just under 31,000 votes. The filing of the challenge was confirmed by Christian Neuwirth, a spokesman for Austria's constitutional court. The court now has four weeks to respond. If it takes the full four weeks, its findings will come just two days before the poll winner, Alexander Van der Bellen, is due to be sworn in. Is Europe lurching to the far right? Europe's nationalist surge, country by country Is populism a threat to Europe's economies? The presidency is a largely ceremonial post, but a victory for the Freedom Party could have been a springboard for success in the next parliamentary elections, scheduled for 2018. Correspondents say the legal challenge threatens to renew divisions created by the vote, which split Austria and exposed, once again, deep differences in Europe over how to deal with the migrant crisis, the economy and how to balance national interests against those of the EU. Mr Van der Bellen was declared the winner of the election the day after voting, with 50.3% of the vote against Mr Hofer's 49.7% - despite preliminary results placing the Freedom Party's Norbert Hofer slightly ahead. But the Freedom Party is alleging numerous irregularities in its 150-page submission to the constitutional court. Mr Strache says he has filed evidence that postal ballots were illegally handled in 94 of 117 district election offices, reports said, suggesting that more than 570,000 ballots could have been affected by this. The party also claims it has evidence that under-16s and foreigners were allowed to vote. \"The extent of irregularities is more than terrifying. That's why I feel obliged to challenge the result,\" Mr Strache told a news conference. \"You don't have to be a conspiracy theorist to have a bad gut feeling about this whole election. Without these irregularities Mr Hofer could have become president.\" The BBC's Bethany Bell in Vienna says that if the constitutional court accepts the evidence presented by Mr Strache, there could be several possible outcomes, including a partial recount or a fresh vote in affected areas. But the court will have to decide whether the law was broken and whether any possible breaches would have affected the outcome of the election.",
    "The report suggested splitting the current role, as both head of the legal system and president of the States. Political expert Dr Adrian Lee said the dual role was unique to the islands. He said they were the only democratic jurisdictions in the world where the person judging a case had been involved in making the law. The Carswell Committee, which authored the report, suggested Jersey's Bailiff should step down as president of the States of Jersey and be replaced by an elected speaker. Lord Carswell said: \"There are various international constitutional documents, which rather frown on the idea of judges having anything to do with the legislator.\" He said there was also a practical reason, as in recent years the Jersey Bailiff had had to spend increasing amounts of time on States work. Dr Lee, a former professor of politics at Plymouth University, said: \"The Carswell Committee also made the point that as the two islands increasingly develop their international personalities, as they're called, it's important that their legal systems and political systems are clear to the outside world. \"At the moment there is some lack of clarity over who is speaking on behalf of, who's representing the island - is it the chief minister, the Lieutenant Governor, the Bailiff or is it all three?\" A spokesperson for Guernsey's Policy Council said it would watch the developments in Jersey with interest. Guernsey States Assembly and Constitution Committee said it intended to discuss the report at a meeting next week.

    "The official ONA news agency said they were flown on Wednesday out of Yemen's capital, Sanaa, which is controlled by the Houthi rebel movement. The US government had requested Oman's help in finding them, it added. The ministry gave no details on the Americans' identities, but one Yemeni security official told the Reuters news agency had been held by the rebels. \"The three Americans were detained by the security forces run by the Houthis and were held on suspicion of spying,\" the official said by telephone from Sanaa. Earlier this month, the US state department said an American contractor for the United Nations who was detained at Sanaa's airport last month had died. John Hamen and a colleague - reportedly also American - were held as they arrived on a UN aircraft from Djibouti. In September, two Americans held hostage for months by the Houthis were freed and flown to safety in Oman, along with a British citizen and three Saudis.

Oman, which is not part of the coalition, has played an active role in efforts to negotiate an end to the conflict. The fighting has left at least 5,700 people dead, about half of them civilians, since the end of March, the UN says.",
    "It has been waiting on a review of the Russian Proton rocket, which failed on its last outing in May while carrying a Mexican payload. Inmarsat's third Global Xpress platform was due to be the next passenger and was grounded as a consequence. The launch on the Proton is now set for 28 August from Baikonur, Kazakhstan. Lift-off will be at 17:44 local time (12:44 BST). Inmarsat is the world's largest mobile satellite services operator. Its principal customer base is the shipping sector, but the company also caters for any groups that need telecommunications away from a fixed line. These include oil and gas installations, the aviation sector, armed forces, aid agencies and NGOs in disaster areas, and TV news crews reporting from trouble zones. Its new £1bn GX network is the biggest commercial UK space project in the process of being rolled out right now. It is designed to incorporate three spacecraft distributed around the globe to give worldwide coverage. Two have already gone up, to relay telecommunications from Asia all the way across to the Americas. The upcoming launch should complete the network over the Pacific, and give customers seamless coverage wherever they are - something that is especially important to the shipping and aviation sectors. Investigators are now confident they understand the loss of May's Proton. The natural vibration in the rocket's third stage loosened bolts that held a turbopump in place for a steering engine. The disruption ultimately broke an oxidizer line and led to the pump shutting down, and the loss of the engine. Measures have been put in place to make sure this cannot happen again. The Proton has had a torrid record of late. Six vehicles and their payloads have been lost in the past five years, and Inmarsat's GX network is roughly a year behind schedule because of all the problems the rocket system has experienced. \"The return to flight is typically the best flight to be on because there is extra caution, extra controls,\" Michele Franci, Inmarsat's Chief Technical Officer, told BBC News. The new satellite is insured, but the company has taken the additional precaution of ordering a fourth platform from manufacturer Boeing. This would be available in mid-2016 should anything go wrong this month. Global Xpress sees Inmarsat take its first, firm step into Ka frequencies to deliver communications. Traditionally, its spacecraft have worked in the L-band. The higher frequency of Ka allows faster throughput connections, giving the new satellites broadband speeds that are 100 times faster than the company's previous generation of spacecraft. \"If there has been any benefit from the delay, it's that it has allowed us to fix network issues that we would have had anyway in this period,\" said Mr Franci \"So, once we go really live at the end of the year, the network will be more stable and more reliable. But we could definitely have done without the delays, that's for sure.\" Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos",
    "One person was injured in the crash on Saturday night, which happened during heavy rain near the national stadium. Police said in a statement on Monday that both drivers were in their 20s and unemployed. The statement prompted many questions online about how they came to be driving the cars. \"What are their names? Who are their fathers?\" one user on the Weibo microblog site asked, according to AFP. \"Socialism is so good that it allows unemployed people to drive supercars,\" joked another. Photos which emerged on Monday showed the lime green Lamborghini with its front section almost entirely torn off. The red Ferrari appeared to have lost a door, and was bashed along on its side and rear. The tunnel itself was also damaged, with a section of the wall torn off and guardrails mangled. Workers could be seen clearing up debris strewn across the road. The cause of the crash is not clear, but police are investigating. Witnesses told local media that the tunnel was often used for drag racing. It was widely observed online that the crash coincided with both the Grand Prix being hosted in Shanghai and the premiere of the latest Fast and Furious film, a franchise full of fast cars and high-value write-offs.",

    "Developers claim the 100MW project at Glenmuckloch, near Kirckconnel, could generate power for more than a century. It is the latest in a series of renewable energy schemes planned for the site, which is owned by Buccleuch Estates. They are part of a project to redevelop the opencast mine as Glenmuckloch Energy Park. The details have emerged in a scoping report for the pumped storage hydro scheme submitted to Dumfries and Galloway Council. Buccleuch Estates has joined with mining company Hargreaves and 2020 Renewables to draw up the plans. It will involve creating two reservoirs - one higher than the other - which will be connected by a tunnel with a pump-turbine. The report states: \"When excess electricity exists within the grid the pump-turbines go into pumping mode lifting water to the upper pond and when demand within the network exceeds available supply the pump-turbines reverse and change to generating mode with water released from the upper pond.\" If the project goes ahead, the lower reservoir will be created from the existing opencast void, while a second, upper pond will be excavated at the head of Halfmerk Hill. The higher reservoir will have a water depth of 22m (72 feet), creating 3.3million cubic metres of water storage. The redevelopment of Glenmuckloch follows the collapse of surface mining firm Aardvark TMC in 2013, leaving a shortfall in the money needed to restore the site to its pre-opencast condition. However since then Buccleuch Estates and Hargreaves have worked to implement a rolling programme of restoration in parallel with coaling operations. Later this summer two community wind turbines will be built to the west of the hydro site. Earlier this year plans for an eight turbine wind farm next to the mine were submitted to Dumfries and Galloway Council.",
    "East Sussex Healthcare Trust which runs the Conquest Hospital in Hastings and Eastbourne District General Hospital is currently rated as \"inadequate\". However, BBC South East Today has learned the trust has failed to improve and is likely to be placed into special measures at a meeting on Friday. The trust said it was awaiting a report to be published and would not comment. The other trusts currently in special measures include East Kent Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and Medway NHS Foundation Trust. Medway's Maritime Hospital was forced to turn away ambulances earlier, and on Wednesday, to help ease the burden on its A&E department. The East Sussex trust was rated as \"inadequate\" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) in March, after failing to meeting government targets. In May, it was criticised by Eastbourne Borough Council, which passed a vote of no confidence in its management. And in July the chief executive resigned while the trust had to apologise after patients' details were found in the street. Leadership would appear to be the big problem at this trust. In its March report, the CQC described a \"disconnect between the trust board and it's staff\" and a \"culture where staff were afraid to speak out\". The trust's problems have been well documented but what has apparently been lacking is any real progress in putting things right. It's my understanding the CQC feel very little has improved in the last few months. Friday's meeting between all the stakeholders will be a chance to discuss the way forward but many people I have spoken to in the wider NHS believe special measures will be imposed on the trust. A spokesman for the trust refused to comment on whether it would be put into special measures. He said: \"We are waiting for the publication of the CQC report next week and until it is published and they have made any recommendation we are unable to make any further comment.\"",
    "Lisa Doughty, who has mesothelioma, was a pupil at Haggerston Girls' School in Hackney, east London in the 1980s. The 47-year-old said the music desks were often covered in dust, which may have had asbestos particles. Hackney Council said it had not received a formal claim and could not investigate until it did. Ms Doughty said she had spent a lot of time in the music room each week rehearsing plays. \"We used to sit on the desks and have to wipe white dust off them,\" she said. \"There were two heavy doors at the entrance to the music room and these would constantly slam, shaking the room. The school was in pretty bad repair so maybe the dust came down from the ceiling when the door closed.\" Ms Doughty said if it was proved the music room was the cause of her cancer, then it was \"possible that many others have been affected\". \"I wanted to raise awareness of this and to appeal for anyone else who has been affected, pupils or teachers, to get in touch.\" Ms Doughty's lawyers, Slater and Gordon, have found that asbestos ceiling tiles were in place during the time that she was a pupil at the school. They are considering taken further legal action. A Hackney Council spokesman said: \"Asbestos was historically used extensively in both public and private buildings due to its fire retardant properties and, as with any building of this age, Haggerston School has been subject to regular condition and asbestos surveys and removals.\" Edmund Young, an asbestos-related disease specialist at the law firm, said: \"Mesothelioma is traditionally a form of cancer that has affected those working in industrial jobs, but we are seeing more and more people - both teachers and former pupils - coming to us who have breathed in asbestos particles while at school.\"",

    "The area near the main administrative block of JNU is filled with passionate students. They cheer loudly as a speaker climbs on to a stage. Slogans like \"free Kanhaiya Kumar\" and \"long live revolution\" fill the air as hundreds of visibly agitated students pour into the area. Those gathered here believe that Mr Kumar, the leader of the university's student union, is innocent of the sedition charges levelled against him, and are shocked by the fact that police entered the university to arrest him on Saturday. Police have alleged he organised an event commemorating the hanging of 2001 Parliament attacks convict Afzal Guru, where \"anti-India slogans\" were raised. The students here passionately defend Mr Kumar when I ask them what actually happened at the event. \"We are not terrorists. We are just students and we also condemn anti-India slogans. Our president had nothing to do with those slogans at the event,\" a student tells me. But she refuses to speak on camera. \"I don't want to be seen on camera. I am worried about my safety,\" she says. Student activist Shreya Ghosh speaks of the fear prevailing inside the university. \"We have been sleeping in different rooms every night to avoid arrest,\" she says. Another student activist Deepshita claims that ideological politics lies at the heart of Mr Kumar's arrest. \"Right-wing students want to increase their foothold in the university and that is why they got him [Mr Kumar] arrested. They feel bolstered because the right-wing BJP party is in power at the centre,\" she says. Professor Rajarshi Dasgupta agrees. It's 3pm and speakers are becoming more ferocious in their attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his BJP party. Among the speakers is Prof Ajith Kanna. \"If Kanhaiya is anti-national, then I am also anti-national,\" he tells the cheering crowd. But he pleads with his students to remain peaceful and not pay attention to rumours. And rumours are not in short supply, flying across the tension filled campus. Among them are that more than 100 armed right-wing activists have entered the campus. I meet right-wing student group Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) member Saurabh Kumar a few blocks away from the protest site. \"The law will decide whether he [Kanhaiya Kumar] is guilty or not but we won't tolerate anti-India activities inside this campus,\" he says. But not everyone is protesting. At one of the student housing facilities, I meet PhD students Bibas Sewa and Bijay Thapa. The two condemn the arrest of Mr Kumar, but agree that the protests have disrupted their studies. Even at a time when politics has gripped JNU, there are some students who just want to get on with their work.",

    "One is the US Grand Prix in Austin, Texas; the other is Singapore. Each one has that certain je ne sais quoi that lifts them out of the humdrum and makes them exceptional. As far as Singapore goes, it's no surprise it has become second only to Monaco as the place where most business gets done over a grand prix weekend. It's a place you just really want to go. That message permeates, and has made it into one of the most desirable races on the calendar. For a start, the ambience is terrific - and, let's be honest, this is what appeals to the business visitors, rather than the demands of racing on one of the longest tracks in F1 in crippling humidity. Singapore is a fascinating destination full stop, thanks to its place at the crossroads of south-east Asia and colonial past. But hosting the race at night adds an extra dimension. The track jags through the city centre under lights, Chinese lanterns adding a dash of colour, the futuristic city skyline the backdrop. As the sun sets, the whole place seems to shimmer and sparkle for a while. Darkness takes the edge off the tropical heat, and a heady, luscious tropical atmosphere settles over the place. For those working at the race, there's a surreal edge to it, too. Know someone who volunteers in sport and deserves recognition for their efforts? Give them the chance to shine by nominating them. First track sessions at dusk, qualifying and race after dark means staying on European time. So you wake up at 2pm, finish work in the early hours and go to bed at six in the morning. You can eat in a hotel restaurant, some of which stay open all night for the race weekend. Better, though, to head to an all-night hawkers' market, where delicious, cheap local food is on offer from a myriad of stalls and you can drink in the atmosphere of the place. Oh, and the track is pretty good, too. It's no Spa or Suzuka, but the Marina Bay Circuit has a challenge all of its own. A long, long lap, a nearly two-hour race, bumps, 23 corners and intense humidity make it arguably the toughest grand prix on the calendar - only Malaysia comes close. Add it all up and it's a race not to be missed. Andrew Benson, chief F1 writer Subscribe to the BBC Sport newsletter to get our pick of news, features and video sent to your inbox.",

    "The victory represented a gain from the SNP, who took the seat in the 2011 Holyrood election. The by-election was caused by the resignation of sitting MSP Bill Walker, who was thrown out of the SNP and jailed for domestic abuse. Cara Hilton, the parliament's newest MSP, said the people of Dunfermline \"deserved better\". The SNP won Dunfermline as part of its landslide election win in 2011 with a majority of just 590 votes, but was not able to hold on. In the end, Labour took the seat with a majority of 2,873 - a 7% swing from the SNP. The Liberal Democrats came third in the contest, with the Conservatives in fourth place. Ms Hilton said: \"After the disgrace of Bill Walker, Dunfermline deserves better and I will ensure that we will be better - far better than what went before.\" Labour majority: 2,873 Turnout 24,200 - 42.65% Swing: 6.94% from SNP to Labour And ahead of the SNP administration's independence referendum next year, she added: \"We need a Scottish government that will address the needs of Scots, not one  that will simply make promises about what will happen after 2016. \"Today Dunfermline has sent a message to Bute House and Alex Salmond: it's time for you to focus on the real priorities of Scots, not your constitutional obsession.\" The by-election campaign centred on contentious local issues, including proposed school closures, while the SNP focused on its national policies such as the council tax freeze and the decision to remove the tolls on the nearby Forth Road Bridge. Despite the result, SNP candidate Shirley-Anne Somerville said she was proud of the campaign she fought. \"We've run a positive campaign trying to support local parents in their schools and I hope we can come together, all of us in the party, to make sure those three schools in the Dunfermline constituency stay open,\" she said. The Liberal Democrats saw their vote drop by 8% on the night. Candidate Susan Leslie said: \"I think it has been a victory for women in politics in Scotland that four women stood in this by-election and fought positive campaigns on the issues for Dunfermline.\" Scottish Conservative candidate James Reekie - whose party saw a 1% increase in its vote - added: \"When the people of Dunfermline are faced with the dilemma of Labour and the SNP, they chose the Conservatives.\" Turnout in the by-election was 42.65%.",

    "The force's interest in using the birds of prey follows trials in the Netherlands. Drones - pilot-less aircraft which are controlled remotely - are used by police forces to capture footage on difficult terrain, including cliffs. But there are concerns criminals are also using the new technology. In November, the Ministry of Justice said a drone used to smuggle mobile phones, SIM cards and drugs into the grounds of HMP Manchester had been recovered by guards. The MoJ reported nine attempts to use drones to infiltrate prisons in England and Wales in the first five months of 2015. A think tank has also warned that drones could be used by terrorist groups. The UK Air Proximity Board said last month that drones had been involved in four serious near misses at UK airports. The birds would help by taking down the aircraft, which they would consider to be prey. However, Jemima Parry-Jones, who is the director of the International Centre of Birds of Prey in Gloucestershire, described the idea as a \"gimmick\". \"Eagles are big, powerful birds; they should not be flown in built-up areas. And secondly in terms of the safety of the bird, you're asking it to grab hold of a drone, which often have four rotating blades keeping it in the air,\" she said. \"If the police in the UK are asking the right experts they should listen to our advice. \"If you don't believe us, try putting your own fingers into the propeller of a reasonably sized drone and see what happens.\" But a spokesman for the RSPCA said: \"In principle we would not have an issue with police forces training eagles in an attempt to tackle drones, although we would have concerns over the welfare of the birds. \"At the moment, however, there is not enough information available for us to be able to make an informed comment.\" A Met Police spokesman said: \"As would be expected in an organisation that is transforming, we take an interest in all innovative new ideas and will of course be looking at the work of the Dutch police use of eagles.\"",

Now, the farming of the shellfish has taken off, secured the highest quality rating and are due to be sold locally. Roger Hall, from the Porlock Futures Community Interest Company, said it had been a \"brilliantly successful trial\". Using oysters from Morecambe Bay in Lancashire, trials were set up to establish whether the shellfish could be farmed in the seas around Porlock. \"We've proved the oysters not only grow but have got the best Class A classification for cleanliness you can get,\" said Mr Hall. \"It's the realisation of what started off as an interesting idea and now we've got 70 trestles with thousands of oysters on them all waiting to be eaten in the restaurants.\" Following a successful trial, the project has been awarded Â£75,000 from the Power To Change fund and raised more than Â£65,000 from the local community.

    "Capped 94 times, Phillips' comments come as criticism has been levelled at coach Rob Howley for failing to bring new players into the Wales team. As they prepare to face France, Wales have capped just three new players since the 2015 World Cup, but Phillips says he understands the situation. \"You can't just blood youngsters because they are young,\" he said. Since 2015, only Blues flanker Ellis Jenkins, Newport Gwent Dragons lock Cory Hill and Ospreys fly-half Sam Davies have been handed their senior debuts. In Wales' final Six Nations clash in Paris, there have been calls for Howley to have one eye on the future and play new faces. Instead the has stuck with the same side that beat Ireland last time out. This comes despite Howley having a host of uncapped players in his squad in the shape of Ospreys flanker Olly Cracknell and lock Rory Thornton, Leicester fly-half Owen Williams, Scarlets wing Steffan Evans, Dragons wing Ashton Hewitt, Scarlets scrum-half Aled Davies and Wasps flanker Thomas Young. Media playback is not supported on this device Howley has also ignored calls for Davies to start at fly-half and for Ospreys' teenager Keelan Giles to come in on the wing. Phillips said he agreed with Howley's decision and that he believed the onus was on the young players to show they are ready for the senior side. \"There's a few guys on the verge, but those youngsters have still got to learn,\" Phillips told BBC Radio Wales. \"They are young and developing, but they will get their time in seasons to come. But they've got to improve in training and show Rob that they deserve to be first-choice players.\" Against France, Phillips believes Howley has got his selection spot on. He added: \"It's a difficult one. In that international jersey should be the best because you are the best in the position. You should not just hand out caps willy-nilly to people. \"The development of the future is an important thing, but that needs to be done in a structured way. \"But it has been difficult because of the way things have panned out.

    "The Dudley Business Loan Fund is aimed at businesses in the borough with fewer than 250 staff that have struggled to secure bank loans. The scheme is a partnership between Dudley Council and the Black Country Reinvestment Society (BCRS). Councillor Shaukat Ali said he believed it could play a \"vital role\" in stimulating the local economy. He said there were some 9,000 businesses in the area that could be eligible. The scheme, offering loans of £10,000 to £50,000, is open to small and medium-sized businesses with a turnover of less than £5m.

    "Transgender protesters forced a halt to debate on the bill on Wednesday. Last month, the state approved a human rights measure banning gender identity discrimination at public facilities. In recent weeks, two other states passed laws ensuring equal access to gender-segregated facilities for transgender students. The bill in Arizona's Republican-dominated legislature would make it a misdemeanour offence to use a public toilet, bathroom, shower, bath, dressing room or changing room associated with a gender other than what is on one's birth certificate. Penalties could include six months in prison. \"If you look like a man and you live your life like a man, you should be able to use a man's bathroom,\" said Dru Levasseur, a transgender rights lawyer for the advocacy group Lambda Legal. But John Kavanagh, the Republican lawmaker who sponsored the bill, said he feared criminals might take advantage of the situation and expose themselves to children of the opposite gender. \"This law simply restores the law of society: men are men and women are women,\" Mr Kavanagh said, according to the Associated Press. \"For a handful of people to make everyone else uncomfortable just makes no sense.\" But, Mr Kavanagh added, police would be allowed to use their discretion over whether to press charges if women used the men's room to avoid a long queue. On Wednesday, Mr Kavanagh agreed to postpone a vote on the bill at the start of a hearing filled with dozens of transgender activists. The bill's opponents say it would force transgender people to reveal themselves and risk harassment, \"Most transgender people try to slip through public places without being noticed,'' activist Erica Keppler said. \"This will turn us into criminals.\" And advocates say transgender people can find it difficult to change gender on their birth certificates because many states require proof of gender treatment surgery. Meanwhile, other states such as Idaho and Ohio do not allow such changes at all, the American Civil Liberties Union said. It is already illegal to discriminate against transgender people in 16 US states, although the extent of protections can vary, the group added. In an ongoing case, a Colorado family has filed a complaint against the state after their six-year-old, who was born a boy, was banned from using the girl's bathroom at her primary school.",

A Lancashire Police spokesperson said: \"We have checked CCTV and spoken to the club and inquiries continue. \"We have had no formal complaint from Mr Marquez.\" After the attack, Marquez tweeted: \"Thanks for all your kind messages and support about Blackpool. \"It was a bad experience but I'm feeling better and just want to look forward to the show on Saturday!\" Mr Marquez made his Strictly debut in this year's series and had been partnering EastEnders actress Tameka Empson, who plays Kim Fox in the BBC soap. They were eliminated in the second round but Marquez has continued to appear in the programme as part of the weekly group routines.",
    "The children at Newington Church of England Primary School in Sittingbourne were aged between four and 11 and received the news in Friday assembly. The scenario had not been discussed with parents or senior staff first, the school admitted. It said the exercise was part of a week of learning about refugees. In a statement, the school said: \"We intended to provide a scenario that would enable the children to empathise with those we were raising money for. \"In future all activities of this nature will be discussed with a member of the senior leadership team prior to being undertaken. \"Only options that allow the children to empathise and understand without causing them unnecessary stress and anxiety will be considered and approved.\" The school said the message could have been delivered in \"a more appropriate manner\" and has apologised to parents and children. It had been taking part in Christian Aid's refugee week. Charity Christian Aid, for whom the school has fundraised, said: \"We have very little information about what pupils were actually told in the assembly, but we would never recommend any teaching approaches that put undue stress on children.\"",
    "The 67-year-old suffered a broken collarbone when he was knocked to the ground outside his Gateshead home in January. An online appeal set up by beautician Katie Cutler raised £330,135. Richard Gatiss, 25, from Gateshead, had pleaded guilty to assault with intent to rob at Newcastle Crown Court. After the sentencing, Mr Barnes said it was \"just about the right length of time\" and he hoped prison would give Gatiss time to reflect on what he had done. \"I hope while he's in prison he'll do some thinking and when he comes out he'll do something useful,\" he said. Gatiss, from Split Crow Road, was caught after police retrieved DNA evidence from a pocket on Mr Barnes' jacket. He had been desperate for money to buy legal highs but ran off empty-handed when Mr Barnes shouted for help, the court heard. Judge Paul Sloan QC described Gatiss' actions as \"despicable and opportunistic\" and said he had picked on Mr Barnes because he was vulnerable. Mr Barnes has lived with disabilities from birth after his mother contracted German measles when she was pregnant. He is visually impaired and stands 4ft 6in (1.21m) tall. After the hearing, Mr Barnes, who was joined by 21-year-old Miss Cutler, said: \"I'm pleased he's been sentenced and I think the sentence of four years is just about the right length. \"I hope while he's in prison he'll do some thinking and when he comes out he'll do something useful. Maybe he might decide to help people, which I think would be a good idea for him. \"It's sad that he was brought to the stage of doing something like this - not necessarily just me, it could have been anybody and they might not have got over the incident. \"But I've moved on,\" he said. Holding back tears, Miss Cutler added: \"It's hard for me to talk about Richard as it wasn't me who was attacked, but I just hope he gets the help that he deserves. \"I'm just glad that that some good has come from this and we can move forward.\" While on remand, Gatiss was kept in segregation for his own safety. Jamie Adams, defending, said it was \"an awful case\" but publicity surrounding it made it difficult to \"keep a proper outlook on what the sentence should be\". On the prison bus to court Gatiss had been \"the subject of some pretty awful double-standard behaviour\" from other inmates, Mr Adams said. \"Life is not easy for him. He is going to be in the public glare for a long time to come and he knows that.\" His father, Karl Gatiss, refused to comment on the sentence outside court but called for legal highs to be banned. Northumbria Police said the sentencing \"should send a message out to those criminals who think it is acceptable to target the vulnerable\".",
    "In the first half of August, 3,800 migrants arrived in the province of Quebec seeking asylum. Most are Haitians who fear they will be deported if they stay in the US. Government officials are now redoubling efforts to counteract misinformation helping bring them to Canada's doorstep. Nearly 60,000 Haitians were offered temporary protection in the US after a devastating earthquake in Haiti in 2010. The Trump administration extended that temporary protection until January 2018. Canada completely lifted its own protected status for Haitians a year ago. In 2016, about 50% of all asylum claims by Haitians was rejected. On Monday, federal Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale warned that \"people should not think that border-hopping is a desirable or productive thing to do\". Canadian diplomatic staff in the US  have been trying to \"aggressively dispel the myths\" about coming to Canada circulating south of the border, including that residency is guaranteed, said Immigration Minister Ahmed Hussen. Federal Liberal MP Emmanuel Dubourg, who is of Haitian origin and speaks Creole, has been tasked with engaging extensively with Haitian media in American cities like Miami and New York. End of Twitter post  by @CitImmCanada Over the weekend, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also addressed the issue. \"Canada is an opening and welcoming society,\" he told journalists at a news conference in Montreal on Sunday. \"But let me be clear. We are also a country of laws. Entering Canada irregularly is not an advantage. There are rigorous immigration and customs rules that will be followed. Make no mistake.\" Mr Trudeau has been criticised over his government's refugee-friendly message and \"irresponsible tweets\" by opposition politicians who argue that those  helped encouraged the surge. Canadian officials are also trying to counteract the spread of misinformation online about the openness of Canada's asylum system. Since January, 7,500 migrants have crossed illegally into Canada. The majority are crossing into Quebec, where migrant numbers more than tripled between June and July to 2,996 from 781. In the first half of August, 3,800 migrants crossed seeking asylum in the province. The federal government has increased the number of staff in the region in order to help process claims that determine whether a migrant is eligible to make a refugee claim. There is currently a five-month wait.",
    "A University College London team spoke to paediatricians at 177 hospitals in England and Wales and found poor knowledge on identifying underweight children and serious complications. This was despite most respondents having experience of treating a child with an eating disorder. The Royal College of Paediatrics said it was working to improve training. Study leader Dr Lee Hudson from the Institute of Child Health, University College London, said more under-13s now presented with eating disorders than meningitis due to the success of vaccination programmes. This shift in childhood illness may be one reason why his research suggested a lack of knowledge on spotting underweight children and the associated medical problems, he added. In the study, one on-call paediatrician was questioned in every hospital providing acute in-patient care for children. During a phone interview they were asked how they would identify if a child was underweight and what clinical examinations they would carry out to check for severe or potentially life-threatening complications. Only half said they would use Body Mass Index to decide if older children or adolescents were underweight, as advised in international guidelines. And only one in five said they would adjust that for appropriate cut-offs in children. There was also a lack of awareness of signs and symptoms of complications in children whose weight had dropped to seriously low levels. The researchers were particularly concerned that only 13% knew a specific danger sign to look for in tests checking that the heart was working properly, the team reported in Archives of Diseases in Childhood. Doctors also scored poorly on knowledge of dangerous complications associated with giving nutrition to someone who has not eaten for a while or is severely malnourished. Dr Hudson said this was not a criticism of doctors because eating disorders tended to present with vague symptoms, but highlighted a gap in training. \"In addition to that, services for children with eating disorders are very hit and miss around the country.\" But he stressed that as those surveyed would be the first paediatricians to assess such children, especially out of hours, they needed to know how to spot dangerously underweight children and teenagers and signs of severe complications. \"From previous research we know that a third of children who are underweight present with life-threatening features,\" he added. Prof Russell Viner, a co-author of the study but also a member of the Royal College of Paediatrics Nutrition Committee, said the college was aware there was a training need around eating disorders and underweight issues. \"We are refreshing training on adolescent health,\" he said. \"And in association with the Department of Health and the Royal College of Psychiatry we are developing a training programme around mental health in adolescents.\"",
    "Couples will now be allowed to have two children, it said, citing a statement from the Communist Party. The controversial policy was introduced nationally in 1979, to slow the population growth rate. It is estimated to have prevented about 400 million births. However concerns at China's ageing population led to pressure for change. Couples who violated the one-child policy faced a variety of punishments, from fines and the loss of employment to forced abortions. Over time, the policy has been relaxed in some provinces, as demographers and sociologists raised concerns about rising social costs and falling worker numbers. The decision to allow families to have two children was designed \"to improve the balanced development of population'' and to deal with an aging population, according to the statement from the Community Party's Central Committee carried by the official Xinhua News Agency (in Chinese) on Thursday. Currently about 30% of China's population is over the age of 50. The total population of the country is around 1.36 billion. The Communist Party began formally relaxing national rules two years ago, allowing couples in which at least one of the pair is an only child to have a second child. China's one-child policy What was China's one-child policy? Trauma and sympathy shared online Correspondents say that despite the relaxation of the rules, many couples may opt to only have one child, as one-child families have become the social norm. Critics say that even a two-child policy will not boost the birth rate enough, the BBC's John Sudworth reports. And for those women who want more than two children, nor will it end the state's insistence on the right to control their fertility, he adds. \"As long as the quotas and system of surveillance remains, women still do not enjoy reproductive rights,\" Maya Wang of Human Rights Watch told AFP. I was born in 1979, the year the one-child policy was implemented. And even then, I wasn't supposed to be born. In my parents' work unit, there were also quotas for babies. By the time my mother announced her pregnancy, the quotas were all used up for the year. But kind-hearted officials decided to look the other way and allowed my birth. My would-be siblings were less lucky. As a result of the policy, my mother had to endure two abortions. Even today, she talks about 'Number Two' and 'Number Three' and what they might have been like. Read more personal stories Carrie Gracie: U-turn may not bring prosperity Writing in The Conversation, Stuart Gietel-Basten, associate professor of social policy at the University of Oxford, says the reform with do little to change China's population and is instead a \"pragmatic response to an unpopular policy that made no sense\". The announcement in China came on the final day of a summit of the Communist Party's policy-making Central Committee, known as the fifth plenum. The party also announced growth targets and its next five year plan.",
    "The 33-year-old, the world's number one ranked Test bowler, is set to miss Lancashire's next two County Championship games. England begin their four-match series against Pakistan at Lord's on 14 July. Anderson suffered a stress fracture in the right shoulder blade during the third Test against Sri Lanka. Paceman Anderson played a key role in the recent Test series against Sri Lanka, which the hosts won 2-0. England's leading wicket-taker in Tests took 21 wickets across the three matches, including 10 as the hosts won the opener at Headingley by an innings and 88 runs. He replaced team-mate Stuart Broad at the top of the International Cricket Council bowling rankings after taking 8-94 in the second match of the series. The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) said Anderson's availability for the Pakistan Test would be \"determined following ongoing management and review by both the ECB and Lancashire's medical teams\". Anderson missed the last two Tests of England's 2015 Ashes win with a side strain, before a calf problem forced him to sit out the first Test against South Africa in December. A short statement from Lancashire read: \"The club wishes James well with his recovery and hopes to see him back in action soon.\" Durham all-rounder Ben Stokes could replace Anderson after returning to competitive action on Friday after injuring a knee during the Sri Lanka series.",

    "British Gas unveiled a 5.1% price reduction, followed swiftly by EDF's announcement of a 5% cut. British Gas's price change takes effect on 16 March, while EDF's kicks in eight days later. The moves benefit customers on a standard domestic gas tariff. Britain's big six energy suppliers have been under pressure to pass on savings to customers after a 57% drop in wholesale gas prices since this time last year. E.On was the first to announce a cut this year of 5.1%, followed by similar reductions by SSE, Scottish Power and Npower. Executive director at consumer group Which?, Richard Lloyd, said :\"Seeing all of the big suppliers mirror each other with small cuts in the face of falling wholesale prices will raise questions in many people's minds about whether competition is working in this market.\" British Gas, which is owned by Centrica, said 6.8 million of its customers on dual-fuel deals would see an average annual saving of Â£31 due to the 5.1% cut. It said customers on so-called \"fix and fall\" tariffs would also benefit from the price reduction. EDF said about 900,000 of its customers would also make an annual saving of Â£31. It said it had no exit fees on any of its fixed deals. Beatrice Bigois, managing director of customers at EDF, said: \"Our prices are under constant review and today's announcement reflects falls in wholesale gas costs.\" Centrica's Mark Hodges, chief executive of its energy supply and services in UK and Ireland, said: \"Competitive pricing is the way to retain existing customers and win new business in this hard-fought market.\" Some commentators warn that these types of \"standard\" tariffs are among the most expensive, so there is still benefit in shopping around. Rachel Fletcher, Ofgem's senior partner for consumers and competition, said: \"These price cuts are a movement in the right direction for loyal customers, but they are dwarfed by the savings available by switching from a standard tariff to a fixed deal. \"You could save more money, up to Â£300, by switching.\" There was also criticism of the industry for failing to cut electricity tariffs, despite falling wholesale costs. Energy analysts at Jefferies said: \"There has still been no movement in electricity tariffs, despite a 30% fall in wholesale electricity prices since August 2014. \"This is likely due to increased environmental costs, which fall on electricity rather than gas, and additional network charges.\" British Gas said it was unable to lower electricity prices due to rising costs, such as for network delivery, adding that wholesale costs only make up a third of electricity bills. Energy and Climate Change Secretary Amber Rudd said there was still more to do. Suppliers are awaiting the outcome of a competition watchdog investigation set to conclude in June, which Ms Rudd said would help determine if consumers were getting a \"rough deal\".",

    "Resuming on 33-1, Machan (81) and Wells put on 134 for the second-wicket before Machan was bowled by Ravi Patel (4-42). Wells fell to Patel shortly after for 61, but Yardy's innings of 70 at Lord's helped the visitors up to 300 all out - a first innings lead of 66. At stumps, Middlesex were 47-0, with Sam Robson racing to 41 not out, trailing by 19 runs. A worn-looking pitch made Machan's fine knock all the more impressive, with Yardy and Wells taking a more workmanlike approach to their innings. Patel was not introduced to the Middlesex bowling attacking until 150 runs were on the board but in just his second over he removed Machan, going on to add Wells, Chris Nash and Ben Brown. Just as the home side were threatening to take control at 216-6, a Sussex fight back began, with Ashar Zaidi putting on 38 with Yardy, followed by a useful 40 from Yardy and Ollie Robinson.

The current leader points to a surge in party membership under his stewardship as evidence that he is building a \"mass movement\" capable of winning a general election, with his allies saying the Tories are \"in retreat\". But Mr Smith said: \"I think that's delusional, and I think Jeremy needs to think a bit more about that straight, honest politics that he started his campaign with.\" He said: \"The straight, honest truth is that we are right now at our lowest ebb in the polls, ever. \"If there was an election tomorrow Labour would be decimated, and that's got to be a shock to Labour's system.\" He said Mr Corbyn was \"misleading himself if he thinks we are heading towards an election victory\". If Labour continued on its current \"disastrous trajectory\", Mr Smith said, it would be left with as little as 140 MPs. It currently has 230, with the Conservatives on 329. \"If Jeremy is deluding himself that we are heading to victory I do not think the rest of the party or the country can afford to be deluded about where we are,\" he said, claiming Labour was \"in the doldrums\" and that it faced \"Groundhog Day\" if Mr Corbyn won.

    "The US central bank said it had unanimously agreed to keep rates at close to zero this month, but believed the economy was on a stronger footing. \"Economic activity has been expanding moderately in recent months,\" it said in a statement. But it still did not give a clear indication of when rates would rise. In its statement, the Fed noted that the job market, housing and consumer spending had all improved. The central bank's policy makers also said they expected inflation to rise gradually toward its 2% target. On employment - which is now at a seven-year low of 5.3% - the bank said job gains had been \"solid\", more  positive language than last month. But it again reiterated that it would only hike its benchmark interest rate \"when it has seen some further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective\". The Fed's decision to keep its main interest rate on hold this month had been widely expected. \"The bottom line is they didn't do a lot. \"But they've nudged the market in the direction of a 2015 rate hike. And it's increased our confidence in a September rate hike,\" Millan Mulraine, deputy head of US strategy at TD Securities told the BBC. Barclays economist Michael Gapen said that he also still expected a rate rise in September, which he said remained the bank's \"baseline forecast\" And Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Funds, said the statement confirmed the Fed was \"taking baby steps\" towards an increase. The interest rate has now been at a record low for six and a half years. The US central bank's decision to cut the rate to such a low level in December 2008 was aimed at boosting growth in the economy amid the global financial crisis. Most analysts expect the first hike in September, but Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen has emphasised that any increase will be determined by the latest economic data. She has also said that when rates do begin to rise, the increase will only be gradual. US stock markets, which were up ahead of the Fed's decision, continued to trade higher after the decision.",

Labour's Roberta Blackman-Woods was the only other candidate who stood in the election. Details of the number of votes each candidate got will be published later. As no other Conservative candidate put their name forward, Mrs Laing was automatically chosen as first deputy chair of ways and means. Deputy speakers, who stand in for Mr Bercow in the main Commons chamber and have a range of other duties, were elected for the first time in 2010.",
    "Complaints about data collection by GCHQ, MI5 and MI6 were put forward by campaign group Privacy International. The ruling said some data collection did not comply with the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). But it added that proper statutory supervision was put in place last year. It was a \"highly significant judgement\", Privacy International said. As part of its review of the spy agencies' activities, the IPT examined the organisations' collection of communications data - involving the \"who, where, when, how and with whom\" was involved in conversations, but not their contents - and personal information about people. Such data is \"vital for identifying and developing intelligence targets\", according to GCHQ. Article 8 of the ECHR states, however, that all citizens have the right to a private life and that any interference with personal data must be lawful and necessary. \"It is very significant,\" said Graham Smith of London law firm Bird & Bird. He added that much of the data collection had been carried out under an older piece of law - section 94 of the Telecommunications Act 1984. \"It gave absolutely no clue at all that it could be used for this particular purpose,\" said Mr Smith. \"Everyone accepts that what the agencies do operationally has to be secret, but the laws that say what they can and can't do shouldn't be secret.\" An official policy about how such data collection should be carried out lawfully came into force in February 2015 - this was put into practice by the intelligence agencies later the same year. It included guidance as to how collected data should be acquired, managed and destroyed The tribunal found that, prior to this, personal datasets compiled by spy agencies did not comply with Article 8 and were therefore \"unlawful\". \"The powers available to the security and intelligence agencies play a vital role in protecting the UK and its citizens,\" said the Home Office in a statement. \"We are therefore pleased the tribunal has confirmed the current lawfulness of the existing bulk communications data and bulk personal dataset regimes.\" It added that the government was \"committed\" to providing greater transparency and stronger safeguards for bulk data collection powers available to intelligence agencies.",
    "Another five soldiers were wounded in a rocket attack on Turkish tanks, the military said in a statement. The fatalities are believed to be the first since Turkey launched its operation inside Syria two weeks ago. Two fighters from the Free Syrian Army were also killed and another two injured in the attack. \"Two of our hero comrades were martyred and five were wounded in a rocket attack on two of our tanks by Daesh (IS) elements,\" the army statement said. The rocket attack was launched near the village of al-Waqf, it added. Syrian rebels backed by Turkey say they have recaptured a number of villages from IS since the Turkish operation - code-named Euphrates Shield - began. The rebels have also retaken the key border town of Jarabulus. On Sunday, Turkey said IS fighters were pushed out of their last positions along the Turkish-Syrian border. Turkish forces have targeted IS inside Syria, but have also attacked Kurdish fighters in the same region. The pursuit of the Kurdish YPG militia has led to criticism by Washington, which regards the Kurds as one of the most effective forces in the battle against IS.",

    "The 20-year-old Frenchman joined Celtic from Fulham in the summer, with his 32-goal haul ensuring he is now one of Europe's most sought-after strikers. And Rodgers insists Dembele has benefited massively from making the switch to Scotland's top-flight. \"He's developed very well and met the challenge to play for a big club, feel pressure and win trophies,\" he said. \"He wants to improve and that's the type of player you want to work with.\" Dembele cost Celtic a development fee of just £500,000 but his value has rocketed after a stunning debut season. Rodgers concedes that the striker will leave the club one day but expects a lot more from him before that time comes. \"I think we all know at some point he will move on, it's just about timing,\" Rodgers told BBC Sport. \"But I know at this point he's very happy here. He's only 20 and he's been a joy to work with. \"There's no doubt there will be a natural point in time that he goes, I think we all understand that. Unfortunately, that's how it goes up here. But if he serves the club well in his time here that's all we can ask for.\" Media playback is not supported on this device Celtic will win the Premiership title if they beat Hearts at Tynecastle on Sunday. They are unbeaten in the league this season, have already won the League Cup and are in the semi-final of the Scottish Cup. Rodgers described the club's unbeaten run as \"incredible\" but knows his side have a lot to do to go through the whole campaign without suffering a loss. \"I think the unbeaten one is very difficult,\" he said. \"We have nine games to go and the last five games you go into a split. The last five are against top six teams so it becomes really difficult. \"In terms of the treble, we never really mention it. We have to stabilise that emotion and just think about performing and playing well. \"We want to win every game we play.

    "Terry Smith, 33, died in hospital in November 2013, a day after being held in Surrey under the Mental Health Act. He had been taken to Staines police station and kept in restraints. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) has referred the case to the Crown Prosecution Service. The IPCC said two sergeants, one of whom had retired, and a health worker contracted to Surrey Police could face charges of gross negligence manslaughter and misconduct in public office. It had investigated eight police officers and two staff,  the methods used to detain Mr Smith and why he was kept under restraint at the police station. Police arrested Terry Smith, a father who lived locally, in Stanwell at about 22:00 GMT on 12 November 2013 after a call for assistance from an ambulance crew. He fell ill and was taken to St Peter's hospital in Chertsey, where he died the following day. IPCC Commissioner Jennifer Izekor said:  \"We have now completed our investigation into the events leading up to Mr Smith's death. \"I have decided to refer the case to the CPS to determine whether any criminal charges should be brought against any officer. \"My thoughts remain with everyone affected by Mr Smith's death.\"",
    "The hotel chain said the investment programme would bring 150 jobs and 10 apprenticeships. Two of the new hotels, located off the Royal Mile on New Market Street, will open at the end of this month. The third, which will be in York Place in the New Town, is scheduled to open in late spring. The new sites will take the total number of Premier Inn hotels in the city to 14, with more than 1,500 rooms. One of the two hotels on the Royal Mile will be a hi-tech \"hub by Premier Inn\", the chain's first in Scotland. The hub will allow guests to control their room settings using an Apple Watch. Additional investment by Premier Inn in the city includes a £1.8m extension at Premier Inn Newcraighall and a £1.2m refurbishment at Edinburgh Central. Simon Ewins, chief operating officer for Premier Inn and hub, said: \"We are absolutely delighted to be opening three new fantastic hotels in Edinburgh and it is great that we are able to bring so many jobs and apprenticeships to the city. \"Hub is a new concept for us which we are really excited about, especially as this is the first one in Scotland and outside of London. \"We are confident our guests visiting the beautiful city of Edinburgh will enjoy this new digital experience and we will look to open more in Scotland in the future.\"",
    "Courts such as Stirling, Kilmarnock and Dundee were jailing nearly 20% of women appearing before them, compared to 7% in Edinburgh and 5% in Airdrie. The judiciary said it was not appropriate for an active sheriff to be interviewed for the programme, but retired sheriff Peter Gillam gave the view from the bench. He served as a sheriff from 1991 until 2013, and said the variations reflected the independence of the judiciary. He said: \"Obviously there is now, as I understand it, a board set up for advising on sentence to the judiciary. \"But every judge is his own person or her own person, and they all have different ways of dealing with things, they all have different views and they are all independent. \"There has to be a certain degree of uniformity and that is undoubtedly enforced by the existence of an Appeal Court so anyone who does something which is particularly outrageous, as far as what is perceived to be the appropriate way of dealing with people, that can be corrected. \"But variety is the spice of life and I think that it would be wrong to try to dragoon the judiciary into dealing with things which they believe to be the correct way of dealing with things. \"They have local knowledge, they know the person, they have full information and they deal with it to the best of their ability and you have to trust that person to deal with it in that particular way.\"",
    "The 25-year-old batsman died from a haemorrhage in the brain two days after being hit on the neck during a match in Sydney on 25 November 2014. The five-day hearing was convened to examine if his death was avoidable. Some players giving testimony at the inquest have been accused of dishonesty for saying they could not recall many of the events of the day. The inquest, which began on Monday at New South Wales Coroner's Court, heard evidence from players including Brad Haddin, Doug Bollinger and David Warner. The court examined whether Hughes, batting for South Australia in a Sheffield Shield game against New South Wales, had been targeted by short-pitch bowling, or had received unsettling comments from opponents. Questions were also raised about whether a bowler told Hughes \"I'm going to kill you\" before he was fatally injured. Hughes' parents walked out of the inquest as the counsel representing the family, Greg Melick SC, criticised the players for repeatedly answering many questions by saying \"no recollection\" or \"I can't recall\". \"At the end of the day, there was a plan, there was sledging, and short-pitched balls were bowled at Phillip Hughes, which increased the risk of an injury,\" Mr Melick said. \"Nine consecutive short-pitched balls from the one bowler aimed at leg stump or the body of the batsman was going too far.\" Suggestions of fabricated evidence were denied by the counsel representing Cricket Australia and its players. Hughes' brother and sister later exited the inquest as the sworn statements from the players were defended. The counsel assisting the coroner, Kristina Stern SC, said concerns about sledging and short balls were \"unnecessary\" and should not form part of the findings. NSW State Coroner Michael Barnes will deliver his finding from the inquest on 4 November. A previous report, commissioned by Cricket Australia, said protective helmets should be compulsory for batsman facing fast- and medium-paced bowling. But it said helmets meeting the newest safety standards would not have saved Hughes' life.",
    "The 19 were freed following mediation by South Sudan's government, it adds. This is the first group to be released since about 125 children were abducted in the cross-border raid. Members of the Murle community carried out the attack. They have previously been accused of stealing livestock and children to raise as their own. More than 200 people from the rival Nuer community in Ethiopia's western Gambella province were killed in the 15 April raid. Ethiopian forces crossed into South Sudan, encircling villages where the children were held. However, the children were freed without any fighting after South Sudanese officials entered into negotiations with the abductors, the Ethiopian News Agency reports. Negotiations would continue to free all the children, it reports. \"The children must be rescued and be reunited with their families. The cattle that was taken should also be handed over to the right owners,\" South Sudan's ambassador to Ethiopia, James Pitia Morgan, is quoted as saying. Ethiopia shares a long border with South Sudan and cross-border raids involving the Murle and Nuer communities are not uncommon. However, the scale of the 15 April shocked many people in both countries, and led to protests in Ethiopia's Gambella region with parents demanding greater protection for their children. Ethiopia's Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn said \"primitive and destructive forces\" carried out the raid.",
    "Priyanka Yoshikawa, 22 and who also has an elephant training licence, said she would use her win to \"change perceptions\". Last year, Ariana Miyamoto was the first mixed-race person to win the Miss Universe pageant. Critics complained then that a \"pure\" Japanese should have won. Only about 2% of babies born every year in Japan are biracial, or \"haafu\", the Japanese word for half. \"We are Japanese,\" Ms Yoshikawa told AFP news agency. \"Yes, my dad is Indian and I'm proud of it, I'm proud that I have Indian in me. But that doesn't mean I'm not Japanese.\" She credited her win to Ms Miyamoto, saying she had helped show \"mixed girls the way\". \"Before Ariana, haafu girls couldn't represent Japan,\" said Ms Yoshikawa. \"That's what I thought too. Ariana encouraged me a lot by showing me and all mixed girls the way. \"I know a lot of people who are haafu and suffer,\" she said. \"When I came back to Japan, everyone thought I was a germ.\" \"Like if they touched me they would be touching something bad. But I'm thankful because that made me really strong.\" A few years ago, a woman of Indian descent, Nina Davuluri, faced Twitter abuse after being crowned Miss America. Some called her an \"Arab\", some a \"terrorist\", and some an \"Arab terrorist\". Indians, in large numbers, came to her defence. Now, Ms Yoshikawa is being criticised for having an Indian father and some Indians have taken to social media to advise the Japanese to \"get over it\". One Twitter user said she won because she \"must have deserved it\" while another said \"after Gautam Buddha, Ms Yoshikawa is the only Indian to make it big in Japan\". In Ms Yoshikawa's case - as in Ms Davuluri's before her - the biggest complaint seems to be the \"lack of purity\". But some are wondering whether this debate over purity has any relevance in today's globalised world. As one Twitter user said: \"Talent cannot be controlled or ruled by caste, colour, gender or country of origin.\" The pageant winner, also an avid kick-boxer and qualified elephant trainer, said that she hoped to change perceptions. \"When I'm abroad, people never ask me what mix I am. As Miss Japan, hopefully I can help change perceptions so that it can be the same here too.\" Ms Yoshikawa's win did not trigger the backlash that Ms Miyamoto received on social media. There were however, several on Twitter that expressed unhappiness. \"It's like we're saying a pure Japanese face can't be a winner,\" said one user. \"What's the point of holding a pageant like this now? Zero national characteristics,\" another complained. Ms Yoshikawa however, was not letting the doubters get to her. \"There was a time as a kid when I was confused about my identity,\" she said. \"But I've lived in Japan so long now I feel Japanese.\"",

    "The Labour leader told ITV it was \"impossible\" for members of his top team to remain in place if they rebelled against a three-line whip. Shadow Welsh Secretary Jo Stevens quit last week over the issue - other senior MPs say they will rebel. Mr Corbyn has ordered all Labour MPs to support the bill triggering Article 50. Labour backed the campaign to keep the UK in the EU in the referendum in June and many Labour MPs represent constituencies which voted for Remain. But many seats which voted to leave the EU are also represented by Labour MPs. Mr Corbyn says he understands the pressures on MPs in pro-Remain constituencies but has called on them to unite around the important issues. His shadow home secretary Diane Abbott has said that, since a UK-wide referendum with a 72% turnout returned a vote in favour of withdrawing from the EU, it would \"be very undermining of democracy\" for MPs to vote against beginning the formal process of leaving. Ms Stevens quit on Friday saying Brexit was a \"terrible mistake\". Shadow minister Tulip Siddiq also quit last week saying she would vote against the EU (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill. Two Labour whips, Jeff Smith and Thangam Debbonaire, who are in charge of party discipline, have also said they will rebel - though they have not resigned. Another shadow minister Daniel Zeichner has said he will vote against the bill, as will other MPs including former Culture Secretary Ben Bradshaw. Mr Corbyn told ITV's Peston on Sunday: \"There was no need for anyone to resign at this stage. It's obviously impossible to carry on being in the shadow cabinet if you vote against a decision made after a very frank and very long discussion of the shadow cabinet earlier this week.\" Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson has said divisions in the party will be handled sensitively and suggested some rebels could be back in senior roles \"within months\". The European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill was introduced after the Supreme Court ruled that parliament - not just the government alone - must vote to trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which starts the formal process of the UK leaving the EU. Prime Minister Theresa May has promised to begin the formal process of leaving by the end of March. The bill is due to be debated by MPs on Tuesday - in a sitting that may last until midnight - and clear the Commons on 8 February, after which it will move to the House of Lords. Labour has demanded changes including giving the Commons a vote on the final Brexit deal before European leaders or MEPs consider it. The Liberal Democrats have vowed to oppose the triggering of Article 50 unless there is a guarantee of another referendum on the final Brexit deal that is agreed with Brussels, while the SNP has vowed to table 50 amendments to the legislation.",
    "He felt a problem after coming on as a second-half substitute at St James' Park and a scan showed a strain. It is the latest in a long line of injury absences for the 26-year-old, who had just returned to action after knee and foot problems. Sturridge has made six appearances so far this season, scoring four goals. Having scored 28 times for Liverpool and England in 2013-14, he was restricted to just 18 appearances last season because of thigh, calf and hip injuries. After recovering from a hip operation in May, Sturridge played three games at the start of this term but then did not feature from 4 October until 29 November. He scored twice in the 6-1 League Cup quarter-final win at Southampton last Wednesday but was hurt at Newcastle after coming on in the 62nd minute. When a foot problem picked up in training forced him to miss the Reds' Europa League win over Bordeaux on 26 November, Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp said Sturridge had to learn \"what is serious pain and what is only pain\". Liverpool, currently eighth in the Premier League, face seven games from now until the first leg of their League Cup semi-final at Stoke on 5 January."

    "Nicaragua's recent election, where Daniel Ortega secured a fourth term as president with a landslide 72.5% of the vote, has drawn sharp criticism from the United States.  The State Department condemned the election process, calling it neither free nor fair. They pointed to the Ortega government's sidelining of opposition candidates, limited election monitoring, and refusal to allow international observers as evidence of a flawed election.\n\nDespite these concerns, Ortega remains popular within Nicaragua. His social programs, coupled with a period of economic stability during his leadership, have garnered him support from both the business sector and foreign investors.  His supporters took to the streets to celebrate his victory. \n\nHowever, opposition groups, like the Broad Front for Democracy (FAD), have denounced the election as a \"farce\" and alleged widespread voter abstention.

    "Greece stands on the precipice of economic ruin, locked into a bailout program that former Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis condemns as \"the greatest disaster of macroeconomic management ever.\"  Despite securing parliamentary approval from Germany, the final hurdle in a long and contentious process, the €86 billion bailout comes at a devastating cost:  Austerity measures so severe that Varoufakis, in a scathing indictment, declares the program \"failed already.\"\n\nThe Greek people, held hostage in a high-stakes game of economic brinkmanship, face crippling withdrawal limits and a future shrouded in uncertainty.  Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, forced to capitulate to the demands of creditors, now leads a cabinet united in their skepticism of the very reforms they must implement. \n\nWhile the emergency €7 billion bridge loan offers a temporary reprieve, allowing Greece to avert immediate default, the long-term prognosis remains dire.

    "The case of coach George Skafidas is a stark reminder of the devastating consequences of betraying trust and violating the fundamental principles of clean sport. Skafidas, entrusted with guiding and supporting young athletes, instead used his position to facilitate the doping of sprinter Bernice Wilson, ultimately shattering her athletic career. \n\nHis actions, which included multiple rule violations spanning several years, demonstrate a blatant disregard for the integrity of sport and the well-being of athletes.  Ukad CEO Nicole Sapstead rightfully condemned his behavior, stating, \"He was put into a position of trust, he abused that trust and as a result categorically destroyed a career.\" \n\nWilson's four-year ban in 2011 for testing positive for banned substances should have served as a wake-up call for Skafidas. However, he continued to engage in doping practices, further jeopardizing Wilson's career and undermining the values of fair play. \n\nThis case underscores the critical need for robust anti-doping measures, ethical coaching practices, and a zero-tolerance approach to those who seek to gain an unfair advantage through doping. The destruction of Bernice Wilson's career serves as a powerful indictment of Skafidas's actions and a stark warning to anyone tempted to compromise the integrity of sport. \n",

The inquiry aims to determine the reasons behind the significant cost overruns and delays that plagued the project, ultimately forcing a reduction in its original scope. \n\nWhile stopping short of a full statutory inquiry, Salmond emphasized the need to learn from the project's mistakes to ensure greater accountability and transparency in future infrastructure projects.\n\nThe inquiry will examine a history of problems, including a bitter dispute between the city council and its contractor, which halted construction for several months. The project's final cost, at £776 million, is double the initial estimate, with the tram network covering only half the originally planned route. \n\nOpponents of the project, such as Edinburgh Central MSP Marco Biagi, have expressed a lack of faith in future project management and cost estimates unless a thorough investigation identifies and addresses the root causes of the trams' troubled history. \n",

    "A recent report by Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International has condemned the conditions at the Australian-funded asylum seeker detention center on the island of Nauru.  The report, based on interviews with refugees and asylum seekers, alleges inadequate medical care, cramped living conditions, and instances of rape and assault by Nauruan locals. \n\nThe report further suggests that these conditions are a deliberate strategy by the Australian government to deter future asylum seekers. However, the report does not offer documentary evidence to support this claim. \n\nThe Australian Department of Immigration and Border Protection has refuted many of the allegations, criticizing Amnesty International for failing to consult with the government before publishing the report. While acknowledging its support for independent scrutiny, the department emphasizes that Australia does not have control over the laws of Nauru, a sovereign nation.\n\nThe report also criticizes the alleged downplaying of abuse claims by Nauruan police.

    "Esteemed members of the board, esteemed colleagues,\n\nWe stand at a critical juncture in the provision of pediatric care within our health board region.  Due to longstanding recruitment challenges for pediatric consultants across the UK, compounded by recent retirements and maternity leave within our own ranks, we are facing an acute shortage of specialized staff. \n\nTo address this pressing issue and ensure the ongoing safety and well-being of our young patients, we are recommending a temporary reduction in the operating hours of the Pediatric Ambulatory Care Unit (PACU) at Withybush Hospital. \n\nUnder this proposed plan, the PACU would operate daily from 10:00 to 18:00 GMT. Children requiring assessment after these hours would be referred or transported to Glangwili Hospital in Carmarthen.  This measure, while not ideal, is necessary to mitigate the risks associated with insufficient staffing levels, ensuring consistent and reliable care.\n\nFurthermore, we recommend merging the on-call pediatric rota with that of Carmarthenshire. This allows for remote consultations by on-call pediatric consultants in the event of out-of-hours emergencies at Withybush Hospital.\n\nLet me assure you that our recruitment efforts remain a top priority.  We are actively pursuing all avenues to attract and retain skilled pediatric consultants.  \n\nOur paramount concern is the safety and well-being of our patients.  These recommendations are not made lightly but are essential to maintain the highest standards of care during this challenging period.  We appreciate your understanding and collaboration as we navigate this complex situation. \n",

    "In a stunning victory, Cara Hilton has claimed the Dunfermline seat for Labour, reclaiming the constituency from the SNP after a hard-fought by-election. Hilton's win sends a powerful message to the Scottish National Party, signaling a shift in the political landscape ahead of next year's independence referendum.\n\n\"The people of Dunfermline deserve better,\" Hilton declared, echoing the sentiment of a community yearning for change after the Bill Walker scandal. \"This victory is about focusing on the real priorities of the Scottish people, not constitutional obsessions.\"\n\nThe by-election, sparked by Walker's resignation and subsequent imprisonment for domestic abuse, became a referendum on both local and national issues. Labour skillfully capitalized on discontent over proposed school closures, while the SNP championed its broader policies.\n\nDespite a valiant effort from SNP candidate Shirley-Anne Somerville, the momentum swung decisively in Labour's favor, culminating in a 7% swing and a comfortable 2,873-vote majority. \n\nHilton's victory, a beacon of hope for Labour, reverberates across Scotland.  It signals a potential turning tide, a challenge to the SNP's dominance, and a renewed focus on the everyday concerns of the Scottish people. \n\n\n",

    "As the use of drones by criminals and terrorists rises, police forces are exploring innovative ways to combat this emerging threat.  One potential solution being considered by the Metropolitan Police is the use of trained eagles, inspired by successful trials conducted by Dutch law enforcement.\n\nDrones, small unmanned aircraft controlled remotely, have become increasingly popular among criminals for smuggling contraband into prisons and by terrorist groups for reconnaissance and potential attacks.  The UK Air Proximity Board has also reported a concerning number of near misses between drones and aircraft at UK airports.\n\nEagles, with their exceptional hunting instincts, could be trained to intercept and take down drones, treating them as airborne prey. However, this approach has sparked concerns about the safety and welfare of the birds.\n\nJemima Parry-Jones, a leading expert on birds of prey, criticizes the idea as a \"gimmick,\" highlighting the risks associated with flying large birds in urban areas and the potential for injury from drone propellers.  The RSPCA, while not dismissing the concept outright,  expresses reservations about the birds' well-being and emphasizes the need for more information before forming a definitive opinion. \n\nThe Met Police, acknowledging their interest in innovative solutions, confirm that they are evaluating the Dutch police's use of eagles as a potential strategy for addressing the growing drone threat. \n",

    "A controversial bill in Arizona has sparked heated debate over transgender rights and access to public restrooms. The proposed legislation would criminalize the use of restrooms that don't align with the gender listed on a person's birth certificate, potentially leading to imprisonment for transgender individuals. \n\nSupporters of the bill, primarily conservative lawmakers, argue that it's necessary to protect women and children from potential harm by individuals who may exploit gender identity laws. They maintain that biological sex should determine restroom use. \n\nHowever, transgender rights advocates vehemently oppose the bill, arguing that it discriminates against transgender people, forces them to reveal their gender identity, and puts them at risk of harassment. They emphasize that transgender individuals already face challenges in changing their gender on legal documents and that many states offer limited or no protections against discrimination based on gender identity. \n\nThis contentious issue is not unique to Arizona.  Similar bills have been introduced and debated in other states, highlighting a growing national conversation about transgender rights and the complexities of inclusivity in public spaces.  A case in Colorado, where a transgender child was banned from using the girls' restroom at her school, further illustrates the challenges and legal battles facing transgender individuals and their families. \n",

    "A serious lapse in judgment by Newington Church of England Primary School has left parents outraged and questioning the school's sensitivity towards young children. During a recent assembly, pupils, aged between four and eleven, were subjected to a deeply upsetting exercise designed to simulate the plight of refugees. \n\nThe school's actions, undertaken without prior consultation with parents or senior staff, demonstrate a shocking disregard for the emotional well-being of their pupils. Subjecting young children to a traumatic scenario, without proper preparation or support, is not only irresponsible but potentially harmful. \n\nWhile the school's intention may have been to foster empathy, their misguided approach has backfired, causing distress and anxiety among pupils.  The school's belated apology rings hollow in the face of such a serious breach of trust.  \n\nThis incident underscores the urgent need for schools to prioritize the emotional welfare of their students and to exercise greater caution when addressing sensitive topics.  The school's commitment to consult with senior leadership in the future is a necessary but insufficient step towards regaining the trust of parents and ensuring the well-being of their pupils. \n\n\n\n\n",
    "The courtroom buzzed with anticipation as Alan Barnes, a frail figure with a gentle smile, took his seat.  At 67 years old, he had endured a lifetime of challenges, born with disabilities after his mother contracted German measles during pregnancy.  But it was a recent, senseless attack outside his Gateshead home that had brought him to this place, seeking justice for a crime that had shaken the nation.\n\nIn January, Richard Gatiss, a young man driven by desperation for money to buy legal highs, had targeted Barnes, knocking him to the ground and fracturing his collarbone.  The image of this vulnerable man, preyed upon by a callous opportunist, sparked a wave of outrage and compassion.\n\nBeautician Katie Cutler, touched by Barnes' plight, launched an online fundraising campaign that captured the hearts of strangers.  Donations poured in, exceeding all expectations, raising over £330,000 – a testament to the inherent goodness that resides in humanity.\n\nNow, Gatiss stood before the judge, his actions condemned as \"despicable\" and \"opportunistic.\"  The sentence: four years in prison, a time for reflection and, hopefully, redemption.\n\nBarnes, his voice trembling with emotion, expressed a hope that prison would provide Gatiss with an opportunity to confront his actions and emerge a changed man.  \"Perhaps he might decide to help people,\"  Barnes mused, his words reflecting a spirit of forgiveness that resonated throughout the courtroom. \n\nAs for Barnes, he was ready to move on, his journey a testament to the indomitable human spirit, a beacon of hope amidst the darkness.

    "Canada is facing a surge in asylum seekers crossing the border from the United States, many of them Haitians fearing deportation from the US.  This influx has sparked a flurry of activity as Canadian officials work to manage the situation and address the spread of misinformation that's driving people to their doorstep. \n\nImagine a wave of hope washing over thousands of Haitians, seeking refuge and a better life in Canada.  Many were granted temporary protection in the US after the devastating 2010 earthquake, but with that status set to expire, anxieties are running high. \n\nCanadian officials are working overtime to dispel the myths circulating about guaranteed residency in Canada.  They're reaching out directly to Haitian communities in the US, using social media and engaging with Haitian media outlets to clarify the rules and realities of Canada's immigration system.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau, known for his welcoming stance on refugees, has stepped in to emphasize that while Canada is open and compassionate, it also upholds the rule of law.  Entering irregularly offers no advantage, he stresses, and all immigration procedures will be followed meticulously.  \n\nThe surge has overwhelmed resources in Quebec, where the majority of crossings occur.  The government is boosting staff to process asylum claims, but the wait times are long, adding to the uncertainty faced by these individuals seeking a safe haven. \n\nIt's a complex situation, balancing compassion with legal obligations, as Canada grapples with a growing humanitarian challenge at its southern border. \n",
    "A recent study conducted by University College London has revealed concerning gaps in pediatricians' knowledge about identifying and treating underweight children, particularly those with eating disorders.\n\nThe study, involving 177 hospitals in England and Wales, found that only half of the surveyed pediatricians would use Body Mass Index (BMI) to assess if older children were underweight, despite its recommendation in international guidelines.  Even fewer adjusted the BMI for appropriate age-related cut-offs in children.\n\nFurthermore, there was a significant lack of awareness regarding the signs and symptoms of complications associated with severe weight loss.  Alarmingly, only 13% of doctors were aware of a specific danger sign to look for in heart function tests.\n\nWhile the researchers acknowledge that eating disorders can present with vague symptoms, they emphasize the need for improved training in this area.  Dr. Lee Hudson, the study's lead author,  points out that the incidence of eating disorders in children under 13 is now higher than that of meningitis, underscoring the growing need for pediatricians to be equipped to identify and manage these cases effectively.\n\nThe Royal College of Paediatrics acknowledges the need for enhanced training and is actively developing programs to address this gap in pediatricians' knowledge, particularly regarding adolescent health and mental health. \n",
    "In a landmark decision reflecting the evolving needs of its people, China has announced a significant shift in its family planning policy, paving the way for couples to have two children.  This historic move marks the end of the one-child policy, implemented in 1979 to address rapid population growth. \n\nRecognizing the challenges posed by an aging population and the social and economic implications of a shrinking workforce, the Communist Party's Central Committee has embraced a more balanced approach to population development. This decision empowers families to make choices that align with their personal aspirations while addressing the long-term demographic needs of the nation.\n\nThe two-child policy acknowledges the changing social norms in China, where smaller families have become increasingly common. While some experts believe this adjustment may not dramatically boost the birth rate, it represents a positive step towards greater individual autonomy and reproductive freedom.  \n\nThis policy shift, announced during the Communist Party's fifth plenum, coincides with the unveiling of new economic growth targets and a forward-looking five-year plan, signaling a commitment to a brighter future for China and its people. \n\n\n",

A stress fracture in his right shoulder blade, a cruel reminder of the physical demands of fast bowling, has cast a shadow over his immediate playing future.\n\nAnderson's absence would be a significant blow to England's aspirations.  His mastery of swing and seam, honed over years of experience, has made him a formidable opponent, a bowler capable of dismantling even the most formidable batting lineups.  \n\nThe 33-year-old, currently ranked as the world's number one Test bowler, played a pivotal role in England's recent series victory over Sri Lanka, claiming an impressive 21 wickets. His absence from Lancashire's upcoming County Championship matches underscores the seriousness of his injury.\n\nWhile the ECB remains hopeful that Anderson will recover in time for the Pakistan series, his recent history of injuries raises concerns.

    "Following pressure from consumers and government officials, British Gas and EDF have announced reductions in their standard domestic gas tariffs. British Gas will implement a 5.1% cut effective March 16th, while EDF's 5% reduction takes effect eight days later. Both companies cite falling wholesale gas prices as justification for the reductions. \n\nThese announcements follow similar price cuts from other major energy suppliers, including E.On, SSE, Scottish Power, and Npower.  \n\nConsumer groups, however, remain critical, questioning the adequacy of these reductions and urging consumers to explore fixed-rate deals for greater savings.  Ofgem, the energy regulator,  estimates potential savings of up to £300 by switching to a fixed tariff.  \n\nCritics also point to the lack of movement on electricity tariffs despite falling wholesale costs.

    "The US Federal Reserve has decided to maintain its benchmark interest rate near zero, citing continued improvement in the US economy.  The decision, made unanimously, was widely anticipated by analysts. \n\nThe Fed's statement acknowledged moderate economic expansion in recent months, with improvements in job growth, housing, and consumer spending.  Policymakers also expressed confidence that inflation would gradually move towards its 2% target.\n\nWhile the Fed did not provide a specific timeline for raising interest rates, the statement's positive tone regarding economic progress has increased market expectations for a rate hike in September. \n\nSome economists, including Millan Mulraine of TD Securities and Michael Gapen of Barclays, believe the Fed's statement supports a September rate increase as the most likely scenario.  \n\nThe benchmark interest rate has remained at a record low for six and a half years, following a significant cut in December 2008 during the global financial crisis.  Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen has emphasized that any rate increases will be gradual and data-dependent. \n\nUS stock markets continued their upward trend following the Fed's announcement. \n",

Good luck with that! 😜 \n\nThen, they needed to choose two deputies, one from the Conservatives and two from the opposition parties.  Eleanor Laing, a Tory, was the only Conservative who wanted the job, so she got it automatically. Lucky her! \n\nAnd for the other deputy spot,  Rosie Winterton, also from Labour, snagged the position. She beat out Roberta Blackman-Woods, who was the only other person who wanted the gig. \n\nSo yeah, the Speaker's got his crew!

    "In a landmark victory for privacy rights, the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT) has ruled that certain data collection practices by UK intelligence agencies violated the European Convention on Human Rights. This momentous decision affirms the fundamental right to privacy in the digital age and underscores the need for transparency and accountability from those entrusted with our security. \n\nWhile acknowledging the vital role intelligence agencies play in safeguarding national security, the IPT's judgment makes it clear that even these agencies must operate within the bounds of the law.  The ruling, hailed as \"highly significant\" by Privacy International, highlights the importance of robust legal frameworks to ensure that data collection practices are both lawful and necessary.\n\nThe IPT's findings, a testament to the tireless work of privacy advocates, send a powerful message to governments worldwide:  the right to privacy is not a privilege; it's a fundamental human right that must be protected even in the face of national security concerns. \n\nWhile the government maintains that current practices are now compliant with the law, this ruling serves as a crucial reminder of the need for continuous scrutiny and robust safeguards to ensure that our fundamental rights are respected.  It's a victory for transparency, accountability, and the right to a private life in an increasingly interconnected world. \n",

    "A recent analysis of sentencing data in Scotland has revealed significant variations in the proportion of women receiving jail sentences across different courts. This discrepancy, with some courts imprisoning almost 20% of female offenders while others jail as few as 5%, has raised questions about consistency and fairness within the judicial system. \n\nRetired Sheriff Peter Gillam, offering his perspective, emphasizes the independence of the judiciary as a contributing factor to these variations.  While acknowledging the existence of sentencing guidelines, he highlights the individual discretion afforded to each judge.\n\n\"Each judge brings their own experiences, perspectives, and approaches to the bench,\" Gillam explains. \"This individuality is an essential aspect of a fair and balanced justice system.\"\n\nHe further points out that the appeal process serves as a safeguard against excessive or unjust sentences, ensuring a degree of uniformity within the system.  \"Judges possess local knowledge, understand the nuances of each case, and make decisions based on the information presented to them,\" Gillam asserts. \"We must trust in their expertise and judgment.\"\n\n\n",

    "The recent release of 19 abducted children is a positive but insufficient step towards achieving justice for the victims of the horrific cross-border raid by the Murle community on April 15th.  While negotiations are ongoing, the fact that over 100 children remain captive is a stark reminder of the ongoing threat posed by the Murle and the urgent need for a more decisive response. \n\nThe Ethiopian government's reliance on negotiation, while commendable in its avoidance of further violence, raises concerns about its effectiveness in deterring future attacks.  The Murle, with a history of cattle rustling and child abduction, have operated with impunity for far too long.  \n\nThe scale of the April 15th raid, resulting in the deaths of over 200 Nuer people and the abduction of over 125 children, demands a more forceful response.  The Ethiopian government must demonstrate its commitment to protecting its citizens by holding the perpetrators accountable and implementing measures to prevent future atrocities.\n\nSimply returning stolen cattle and abducted children is not enough.

This echoes the backlash faced by Ariana Miyamoto, the first mixed-race woman to win Miss Universe Japan just last year. \n\n\"Yes, my father is Indian, and I'm proud of it,\" Yoshikawa stated confidently. \"But that doesn't diminish my Japanese identity.  Being mixed race is a part of who I am, but it doesn't define me.\" \n\nYoshikawa acknowledges the struggles faced by \"haafu\" individuals in Japan, a term used to describe those of mixed heritage. She shared her own experiences of feeling ostracized and perceived as an outsider upon returning to Japan after living abroad.\n\n\"It was hurtful,\" she admitted,  \"but those experiences made me stronger. Now, as Miss Universe Japan, I hope to use my platform to challenge these narrow perceptions and show that diversity is a strength, not a weakness.\"\n\nYoshikawa's victory, though met with less vitriol than Miyamoto's win, still triggered whispers of discontent on social media, highlighting the persistent undercurrent of racial bias in Japanese society.  \n\nHowever, Yoshikawa remains undeterred.  \"I've lived in Japan for most of my life, and I feel Japanese,\" she affirmed.  \"Hopefully, I can inspire others to embrace diversity and recognize that what truly defines us is not our heritage, but our character, our values, and our contributions to society.\"\n\nHer story, a testament to resilience and self-acceptance,  is an inspiration to all who challenge traditional notions of identity and strive for a more inclusive and accepting world.  \n\n\n",

It's a heartbreaking setback for Sturridge, who had just battled back from a series of knee and foot problems. \n\nIt's like a cruel joke for the 26-year-old, a player whose brilliance is often overshadowed by his frustratingly lengthy stays on the treatment table. Remember that magical 2013-14 season when he was banging in goals for fun?  Since then, it's been a constant cycle of injuries, recoveries, and more injuries.  Thighs, calves, hips – you name it, Sturridge has probably tweaked it. \n\nJust when it seemed like he was finding his form again, scoring a brace in Liverpool's League Cup demolition of Southampton, fate intervened once more.  Jurgen Klopp, Liverpool's ever-optimistic manager,  had even joked about Sturridge needing to learn the difference between \"serious pain and only pain.\"  Sadly, this time it's serious.\n\nWith a packed December schedule ahead,  Sturridge's absence is a major blow for Liverpool as they fight for a top-four spot and aim for League Cup glory.

    "Global efforts to combat the HIV/AIDS epidemic have achieved a momentous milestone, with 15 million people now receiving life-saving antiretroviral therapy (ART).

Today, that number has increased more than twentyfold, a testament to the effectiveness of global collaboration and targeted interventions. \n\nThe UN AIDS report highlights the remarkable progress made since the turn of the millennium:\n\n* **30 million new HIV infections averted**\n* **Nearly 8 million AIDS-related deaths prevented**\n* **Annual new HIV infections reduced from 2.6 million to 1.8 million**\n* **Annual AIDS-related deaths declined from 1.6 million to 1.2 million**\n* **Global investment in HIV/AIDS increased from $4.8 billion to over $20 billion**\n\nWhile celebrating these accomplishments, the report acknowledges persistent challenges:\n\n* **Awareness of HIV status:**  A significant barrier to treatment access, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, where 66% of new infections occur.\n* **Treatment access for children:**  While progress is being made, ART coverage for children living with HIV remains significantly lower than for adults (32% versus a global average exceeding 40%).\n\nThe report emphasizes that the next five years are critical, advocating for intensified investment to achieve the ambitious goal of ending the AIDS epidemic by 2030.  This coincides with the transition from the Millennium Development Goals to the Sustainable Development Goals, which encompass a broader framework for global development.\n\nUN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, acknowledging the progress made, declared, \"The world has delivered on halting and reversing the AIDS epidemic.

    "Dumfries and Galloway Council is embarking on a journey to reshape the educational landscape of Dumfries, seeking to optimize resources and ensure a bright future for the town's young minds.  A new report, set to be presented to the local authority next week, unveils a plan to align school capacities with shifting demographics, ensuring that every child has access to a high-quality education.\n\nThe town's educational landscape has transformed over the past two decades.  Secondary school enrollment has declined significantly, while primary schools find themselves with ample space to accommodate a growing number of young learners.  \n\nThe council's ambitious Learning Town scheme, with its construction of new schools and refurbishment of existing facilities,  has created an opportunity to rethink school capacities and ensure efficient utilization of resources.  \n\nUnder the proposed plan, Dumfries Academy and Dumfries High School will see a temporary cap on their Year 7 intake, a measure designed to align enrollment with current demand.  These caps will be reviewed annually, ensuring flexibility and responsiveness to future changes in student numbers.\n\nMeanwhile, primary schools, with the exception of those slated for relocation to new sites, will have maximum intake levels set at or above their 20-year average.  This ensures that primary education remains accessible and responsive to the needs of the community.\n\nThe council's proactive approach to managing school rolls reflects a commitment to providing a sustainable and equitable education system for Dumfries.  By adapting to changing demographics and optimizing resource allocation, they are paving the way for a brighter future for the town's students. \n",
    "Reading FC has bolstered its attacking options with the signing of Icelandic forward Jón Daði Böðvarsson.  The 25-year-old, arriving from Wolverhampton Wanderers on a three-year deal,  is expected to inject pace, power, and versatility into the Royals' frontline. \n\nBöðvarsson's acquisition comes as a timely boost for manager Jaap Stam, as veteran striker Yann Kermorgant faces a spell on the sidelines following hip and groin surgery. \n\n\"Jón is a perfect fit for our system,\"  Stam explained.  \"His ability to operate across multiple attacking positions, whether as a central striker, part of a two-man attack, or on the wing, gives us valuable tactical flexibility.\"\n\nStam highlighted Böðvarsson's physical attributes and technical skills, stating, \"He's a strong runner, comfortable on the ball, and possesses good pace. He'll undoubtedly be a valuable asset to our squad.\" \n\nBöðvarsson, who joined Wolves from Kaiserslautern last summer, made 48 appearances, scoring three goals.  He now embarks on a new chapter with Reading, eager to make a significant impact in the Championship. \n"
