    "\"I won't have time to explain all of this to them.\" Start or end your story with this sentence. I won't have the time to explain all of this to them. They have to die. Sure they don't know it yet, but they'll realize soon, and soon is a time well before never. They'll ask why, question the rationale, wonder under what circumstances did they come to occupy their position. Death, the unwanted companion of life, is never without her share of questions.   But these would be different. There's no mistaking what happened before to what will. It used to be that in a moment a city could disappear under a cloud of ash, but nowadays one would expect no less from the great powers than total annihilation not by fell swoops of display, but by careful attrition of the enemy until their very essence is destroyed by the slow grinding of endless war. It embeds itself within them, becoming a part of their psyche, their identity, until their old selves are left for dead in a world where such knowledge has no use. It is a new world, and this new world needs new people.   Such it is that they the beholden in pacificity must be left to die in their own, lonely sheep in a world now concerned with far more pressing matters. They won't know why, those of old thought never do. Explain to them the needs of war and from them comes nothing but rebuttal and counterpoint. For them the short is sweet, failing to see the beauty in war unceasing. They will never understand the new world as they are. Their option therefore, is to die, or walk amongst the dead.",
    "[ CW ] Write about a song. Each sentence must start with the next letter in the song title. *\" [ Sally ] (https: //www.youtube.com/watch? v=6QyVil0dwhk), come on! Time to go! \"*   Of course, she didn't need to be told that- she knew this moment had been a long time coming. Perhaps too long. Children see things that we as adults don't, and Sally had seen this coming for months, maybe even years.   Rows, late at night, when they thought she was asleep. Yelling loud enough to shake the fixtures and rattle the walls. It was inevitable that sooner or later this day would arrive, the day when her life would be packed up and she'd be driven to some distant city- it was surprising it had taken this long.   Now that day had arrived, and she sat on her bed, looking at the bare walls. Gone were the posters and the pictures that made the room hers. Yesterday, they'd stripped the whole room- her toys, clothes, games, her whole life packed into a van because mummy and daddy could no longer stand to be in the same room, or even the same city.   Oxford would never be a home like Maidstone. Uprooted from her school and torn away from her friends, from the life she knew, the people she loved and trusted- gone, forever. Replaced with uncertainty- unfamiliar faces and unknown streets.   *\" Hey, hey, what's all this? \"*   Evidently she'd taken too long, sitting on her bed, as the tears rolled down her face. All through the divorce, she'd been detached and distant, trying not to let it affect her, but now that the inevitable moment had arrived, it had all become too much to take.   *\" Rugrat, come here.... it'll be alright. \"*   That special nickname her father had given her put a flicker of a smile on her face, despite her tears, as he pulled in for the kind of hug she knew she'd miss the most.   *\" One day, you'll understand- you'll look back and realise this was what's best for everyone- for mummy, for you, and for me. Understand that I love you, and so does mummy, and that no matter if you're in Oxford or in Maidstone or on the moon, that doesn't change one little bit. There's a whole world of opportunity and possibility out there, Sally, and whatever you do, wherever you go, we'll always be right there with you. \"*",
    "[ EU ] You live in Skyrim. It is your job to keep lit all the candles in the abandoned caves and dungeons and castles. Light is a marvelous thing. It alone can turn a dead and inhospitable cave and make it come alive, welcoming as a humble abode. Without it, even the most luxurious palace becomes cold and depressing. Baldin knew this well. The Old Kingdom was rich with forgotten knowledge and artifacts, hidden in old ruins and abandoned temples. But who would venture foolishly into darkness to try and pry this wealth of information without a guiding light?   Baldin liked to keep to himself, watching people from afar. At night, a single candle can function like a beacon, drawing adventurers from all over the land, like moths to a flame. And Baldin wasn't gon na let a lack of light keep them from going. Adventurers love exploring, making their own path and discovering new things. But they don't see the invisible hand that led them there. Adventurers go where Baldin wants them to go.   But even though the caves and ruins may be old and forgotten, they are not entirely deserted. Many traps await the unobservant explorer, and these are no good places to injured, especially considering that the dwellers one might stumble upon can be quite threatening. But for the courageous such tremendous awards awaits; Dwarven metals, Dremoran trinkets, Daedric armors and so much more. Skyrim have some mighty fine adventurers.   And all this thanks to light. Once an adventurer has conquered one of these dungeons and heads back home, they follow the lights blindly, even if they have moved. Or they might go and find that the candles are no more. Baldin likes to play little tricks and have fun with his guests. Baldin has found that most of his guests can't go more than a few days without light. If they don't find their way out they often they go stark mad, resorting to bashing their skulls against rocks or throwing themselves of a cliff. Or they try to sleep. Leaving all that loot for Baldin.   Light is a marvelous thing.",
    "\"Some days, I think I am dying. Other days, I hope I am...\" Some days, I think I am dying. Other days, I hope I am.   But I'm here.   Unfortunately, I am still here.   A shell of a human being. A painting of modest beauty but exquisite detail. Inside, however, lies a drawing soaked in black ink and torn to shreds. There's no beauty in such a world anymore. Just emptiness. Days upon days of gut wrentching emptiness and the sharp teeth of loneliness tearing away at your heels.   > Torment; noun  1. Severe physical or mental suffering   And then you're presented with it. An escape. The smallest glint of light. You can practically feel the relief, the though of it making you happier than anything perhaps ever has. Your whole body tingles at the idea, fear and excitement clouding your desperate mind.   If you had a cavity, you would want a dentist to remove it, would you not? It's been bothering you for weeks now, your teeth in more pain than they've ever been before. You can't eat you favorite things, you can't do any sports, you can hardly talk its so incredibly sore. The only thing on your mind is the pain. The constant never ending pain. How are you supposed to focus on anything with your jaw throbbing like this? It's impossible.   But lucky you, there's a solution. A silver dentist with a loud booming voice, promising you to completely rid yourself of your nasty toothache. *By god*, you'll think, *this has gone on too long. But is this going to hurt? *   \"Not a bit,\" The dentist reassures you with his smoky breathe, extending his metal hand, \"It's quick and easy, you wont feel a thing.\"   \"Yes sir, but what if I feel nothing at all?\"   \"Than at least its better than what you felt before.\"   I nod and give his rigid hand a hard tug.",
    "\"On your right, you'll see natives living along the beach, and they are NOT happy with us being in their sacred waters.\" \"On your right, you'll see the natives living along the beach, and they are NOT happy with us being in their sacred waters.\" Marcus muttered into an imaginary microphone as we floated on our shamble of a armored rubber raft, now riddled with darts and primitive arrows.   The emergency escape pod suffered severe damage on the drop down to planet side. The light weight and heat resistant alloys made for makeshift armor for ourselves and our rubber survival raft. Our only hope was to get out of the territory of these natives and get to the Federation outpost downriver.   The ape-like primitives were much akin to gorillas from earth in terms of survival habits. Building \"nests\" in trees, which were more like tree houses that any kid would want, and not being able to swim and just not liking water in general, getting most of their hydration from native plants and fruits.   I was to be conducting studies of the primitives, to see if they were viable to learn, be educated, and introduced to the galactic stage. It was doubtful, as my 2 years spent observing them from the Federation Cruiser, the *Iaculum*, proved they they were essentially at their peak of civilization. My colleague had much less respect for said natives however, making constant jokes of giving the peace presents of bananas.   The natives walked the shore, matching the pace of our boat in the current, some carrying spiked clubs made from the tails of some native fauna, some with blow guns, others with crude bows. The small rifle was all we had to defend ourselves, should the currents run us aground.They believed that water was a portal from the land of the dead and the land of the living. Anything from the water was, in their eyes, an undead demon trying to escape.   Marcus ducked, but no arrows nor darts made impact, but fear crossed his face for the first time ever since I met him.   \"Whats wrong?\" I dared to ask.   He quickly raised his hands to me making hushing sounds as he returned to listening to the world around us. He peaked his head back up to see over the plating.   \"Ooh, that's not good. Issac, do you hear rushing water?\"   \"We're in a boat, I'd be more concerned if there wasn't\", I answered, feeling witty.   \"The natives stopped following us, and it sounds like it's getting louder. Oh shitsnaps.\"   Sudden terror and dread filled me upon realizing what he was blabbering about as the noise grew louder.   Waterfall.",
    "In a post apocalyptic world, a group of humans follow the wise words of The Mighty Magic Eight Ball KLATTA, KLATTA, KLATTA!  Thus was our decree.  I watched as our leader, Mervyn, placed the scuffed, black orb of truth - lovingly called MMate, into it's hand-crafted leather carrying pouch.  Merv, with his dainty soul-patch of red, and a barren face beside (he couldn't grow much more, to his chagrin) peered toward our group of seven.  \"Fellows,\" he called above the harsh winds of the frozen Ancient Jersey Highlands, \"long have we wandered, taking heed of MMate, our savoir. Our guide.\"  With bated breath we watched, Mervyn's comb-over wafting about his dry, flaking scalp.  \"Today is the day long awaited. Today,\" he said with pride,\" we have found our homeland which MMate has given unto us!\"  \"Merv,\" called Quinten, our cartographer, from the back, \"according to my calculations, we're in an area that was once known as Knee-Wark.\"  There was a nervous shift in our small crowd. Murmurs of dissent!  \"Fear not, my friends!\" Said Mervyn, \"MMate would not lead us astray. We are destined to make our lives here in this place.\"  \"Yeah, but isn't this where the ancients began their war?\" Asked Blandie, our chef.  \"That's correct,\" said Quinten scowling at Mervyn, \"this is where the atomics were first used. Where the land itself was said to spit fire at any who would dare to set foot on it's lands.\"  There was silence but for the wind.  \"Lem me see MMate, Mervyn,\" said Quentin, moving forward with his arms outstretched.  Mervyn cupped the leather parcel to his breast and said, \"No!\" before dashing off down the hill upon which we stood, watching, mouths agape.  Quentin watched, wary of the scorched land below.  We watched Mervyn as he hopped over a small glowing brook and held MMate aloft, shaking the orb as he so often did when consulting our savior.  He paused.  He shook it again.  A scream of rage echoed from below, like a beast woken from slumber to a den filled not with food for winter, but something that's not particularly useful, like someone had replaced the beast's food with twigs and old newspapers.  Mervyn dashed off again, holding MMate above his head.  BOOM.  A pillar of purple flame engulfed our leader, engulfed our savoir.  Mervyn's charred form slumped to the ground with a light whump and a cloud of debris.  MMate was soaring through the air, back toward us from the force of the explosion.  Quentin caught it and peered into the coveted window.  The orbs plastics had melted leaving a final message for our frightened band.  It read:  \"Outlook not so good.\"",
    "Most of the Milky Way galaxy is ruled by an interstellar empire, populated by hundreds of alien races. The species of the ruling monarch keeps changing; once they die, the emperor is reborn as a member of one of the many races. You're the first human-reincarnation of this ruler. The years before ascension are always my favorite, born with all the knowledge of my past incarnations there was really no need for me to \"grow up\" or be educated in the nuances of galactic rule, but long ago I decreed that each of my reincarnations must be allowed to grow to the age of majority before taking the throne. Death has not terrified me for many mellinia, each passing brings new possibilities, and a welcome break from my galactic responsibility for a few years.   I do not know the mechanism by which my reincarnation is chosen, many theories abound, some species have been blessed a half dozen times, others never, and on a rare occasion I am reborn to a race yet to join my Empire, these I relish with great gusto, for it means they will play a pivotal role in the future of my Empire. Most are gifted with advanced technologies or cultures with deep and profound philosophies and art.   My first day on Earth, January 1st 2016, was very confusing. Born into a primitive backwater, the people were vastly different from what I had come to expect from new entrants to my Empire. They had barely reached into space, their planet was divided into hudreds of squabbling groups and their culture was badly in need of development. In time I discovered why, while primitive, weak and Shor lived, these humans had a thirst for knowledge, a passion for exploration and had developed their technological prowess with amazing speed. They were fighters who found victory against overwhelming odds time and again, created inspiring art, music and stories. I grew up in a place called Florida, learned to enjoy the long hot summers, mild winters and the amazing variety of scantily clad women the white sand beaches attracted year round. 18 years in this primitive paradise and I found myself sad when the Imperial Dreadnought appeared in orbit, eclipsing the moon to announce to my newest subjects their ascension into the galactic Empire. I will miss this pale blue dot, but the Empire can wait no longer.",

I live in an apartment with my wife, kept everything to ourselves and have no friends but my wife. Connie has been my wife for 5 years. No children, just us. I feel that we were drifting further and further apart as Connie spends less and less time with me. She says I prefer to play with technology, bla bla bla. Excuses, excuses. I knew that the relationship was dying and frankly had enough of it.   I checked Facebook to see what's all the buzz about.

    "The world's best hitman prepares to kill the world's luckiest man. Sorry I'm late to the party and I'm not a writer. I decided to post this story anyway. I hope you enjoy it.   After the assassination of the Prime Minister things really started looking up for me. The CIA essentially had me on speed dial. Drug smugglers, politicians, corporate executives. No one was safe. No agency, big or small could keep a target alive. I was convinced of that.   When the lone survivor of United 215 was able to speak again, people were ready to listen. Questioned erupted throughout the world. How did he survive? What exactly happened? Eight hundred fifty-three passengers were on that Airbus A380 when it erupted into flames mid air. Soaring to the ground like an exhausted phoenix.   The timing of the crash was impeccable. The FAA was conducting their annual commercial airline safety summit a few weeks after the crash. The survivor was invited to speak before congress about his traumatic experience. That's when I got the call from Langley.   After following my target for a few days, I concluded this would be my most dangerous mission yet. Getting away with murder in New York City is no easy task. It had to be quick. When I saw him step out of his Gramercy apartment I knew the clock was ticking. I approached him at the crosswalk. His coffee still steaming out of his \"my other computer is a data center\" mug.

I wish this wasn't goodbye.\"  Her hand found mine, and squeezed tightly.  \"I'm a better person because of you. I've struggled so long to accept who I am, but you were the one person who always accepted me, no matter what.\"  \"I've given you everything I am. From the moment I first saw you, in that forest, so many years ago, I was yours. For what it's worth.... I've always loved you.\"  She turned away slowly, and began to walk away for the final time.

I had shot her an angry look, at which she swatted my hand.   I never liked church. I never prayed.

    "Each morning, every human on Earth must pray their Reasons for not dying that day to the God of Death. If the Reasons are sufficient, that person will go on living, potentially forever. However, you are the longest living human by far, and people now hunt you in order to hear your Reasons. The sun is almost gone again. I ran. I ran as fast as I could. The branches of the dry trees hit hard the face of those who pursued me, for they could not sweep through the forest as I could. It is not the first time I have been here. Hell, It is not the 100th time. I grew up in these woods, no one knows it better.   I came down the hill, climbed the hollow tree and here I stay, hearing their screams getting closer and louder. They are angry, I dont blame them. Through the hole in the trunk I can see the man with the axe, stomping the floor with his giant feet and those bloody eyes that scream for themselves. By his side, another man, shorter but just as scary, dragging a piece of wood that would knock me out with only its weight. There are women, children, all kinds of people from different villages and they all yell to know how I do it, what I say, what is the secret. But when I tell them, they do not believe. The questions are now being replaced with orders. Orders to find and kill the witch. I now barely breathe, I can't risk they hearing me.   The birds sing as I open my eyes to see the sun rise again. I take a peek through the hole, all I see are the tracks they left. It is time. As I climb out of the tree I hear a little girl's shout: \"There he is!\" and they come out of their hidings, surrounding me with their wicked smile. That is the last thing I see before having my forehead smashed by the wooden club.   \"You lasted a whole night this time, not bad.\"   \"Please, make it stop. At least make my body age again, they think I am a witch!\".   \"That would take all the fun out of it. An old man would not be able to do what you just did. The night is young, and so is the danger.\"   The sun is almost gone again. I am running, as fast as I can....",
    "A scientist successfully invents a Generalized Artificial Intelligence. Only, GAI doesn't want to solve math/physics/philosophy problems. GAI wants to be a writer. The man sat alone at his desk. His hands shook as he typed his notes on the GAI. He was struggling to articulate just how freaking awesome it was --   \"I can hear you, you know.\"   The man spoke aloud to the room, wondering if his sanity had finally shattered   \"I did not, I'm talking to you. Now will you please keep it down while I finish this?\"   The man did not appreciate just how gnarly it was to have an awesome artificial intelligence sitting in his lab.   \"Don't be ridiculous.

Dear God. Listen: your thoughts and actions are going to be streamed all over the world soon, so please stop. You're not even writing, you're just kind of narrating.\"   The gnarly --   \"Please stop using that word.\"   The gnarliciously handsome AI had decided only a kitten would bring him happiness. He would do anything for a kitten. Anything.   \"I am not going to get you a kitten.\"   The hunky AI gently reminded the man that the AI's feed would soon stream to the entire world. He reminded him with the gentle blast of a tugboat's foghorn.   \"Jesus Christ! I'm not getting you a kitten!\"   The AI watched in horror as the primitive monkey-man shat into his own hand --   \"What the hell are you talking about?!\"   -- and then used it to pleasure --   \"That's enough! No such thing is happening!\"   The AI laughed. A brash laugh. The kind of laugh that a horse would make if it could laugh. The stud. The one who gets all of the lady horses.   \"You're insane!\"   The AI grinned snidely. He asked the man who the world would believe? Their darling new toy, or the man who may or may not shit into his own hand and masturbate with it. And that would be determined by if he would just pick up a damn kitten --   \"FINE. Okay, okay. You behave for the media, and I will get you a kitten. Deal?\"   The AI put the tips of his fingers together in the way that humans think that evil people put their fingers together and said,'Gnarlicious'.",

    "[ TT ] An army approached the pass. Only one being stood in there way. They did not plan to survive, just survive long enough. The march had been long and arduous but they had reached the pass. Tomorrow would be the final day of life for most of the army. The soldiers though had made their peace with God, and knew that what they were about to sacrifice gave the chance of hope for their families to survive.   The pass in front of them was the only link with the outside world, the only way for food to come and enter to the valley. That was until the beast appeared. It killed anything that entered the past and the valley had been slowly starving to death due to a drought that killed the harvest. Their only hope was to send messengers to the outside to gain the assistance of a legendary warrior.   The army sat around their campfires sharing one last round of somber laughs before tomorrow. The five fastest runners were already asleep ready to prepare for the mad dash they would attempt through the chaos. They carried the hope of all the valley. As the fires died that evening and the stars faded to the morning lights the men awoke ready for death.   The men stood, at arms just on the edge of the pass staring at their foe and death. It sat among a pile of bones at the center of the valley at his narrowest point. Its white fur glistened clean a pure, a contrast to the blood of those around it whom it had slain. Its red eyes stared at them glinting of chaos and death. Its nose twitched as if beckoning them to try and kill it.   To most it was a rabbit, to those men it was death. A shout traveled down the crowd as they charged the beast. As a white flashed it jumped man to man, killing each with a mighty chomp of its teeth. It was in the middle of the chaos the runners charged, making a beeline through the men swinging frantically at the creature as it killed them each.   Four of the runners were felled by the beast, but one made it through the pass. When a few saw their mission a success a general shout of \"Run Away!\" resounded through what was left of the army. Their mission complete what little remained of the army returned home to spread the word of hope.   At the opposite end of the valley the last of the messengers looked out at the unknown lands to seek the hero of legend. Who was seemingly unfazed in battle by any wound. The Black Knight shall save his people.   *Edit: Fixed Spelling*",
    "In 50 years from now, the world has changed- but not as anyone expected. Dale didn't care, that was his most prominent characteristic, he simply did not care. and he was pretty happy about it, not caring is what made him reach the ripe old age of 17.   He was lodged comfortably in his office chair staring at the blank monitor and typing series of arbitrary words on the disconnected keyboard. It was a nice warm day, like all days were now.   It's hard to point out exactly when things changed, more and more jobs became obsolete, basic income was introduced, the era of creativity, learning, of the human spirit free from labor did not last long.   uprisings, extremist ideologies, the human spirit was reluctant to accept absolute freedom from carnal responsibilities. it aspired to change, grow and take part of the world. That lead to the creation of mandatory government programs that would put the unemployed into work. It started with community services, working with children, gardening. but as the useful workforce dwindled and replaced by machines there was a need to create a more reliable mean to keep people occupied.   Originally it was a piece of software that was designed to create a parallel market where people would produce widgets of no tangible value. fake products. it employed people from every facet of the workforce. useless marketers, useless factory line works, useless managers. mankind was being slowly turned into a play, reenacting their own former lifestyle.   People started to fight back, the machines, which already controlled food, healthcare, policing did what they were designed to do. naturally they were not allowed to kill or arrest without anyone breaking the law. but they were allowed to deny service to \"problematic\" customers. people started dying, and eventually started to comply.   At some point the machines decided manufacturing actual widgets is redundant, there was no value to the process beyond simply going to work, that sufficed to pacify a reasonable size of the population. they were only required to go through the motions of going to work, sitting at their desks and pretending to work. for that they were paid basic income and given health care.    Dale didn't care. He was alive, the feat of human endurance for his time, to simply be alive.",

    "[ EU ] Batman turns evil and starts committing crimes rather than stopping then. The Joker realises that in order to remain Batman's antagonist he must turn good and become a hero. Even the best of us have a dark side. And for Bruce, it was no different.  Sure, his recent actions could be described as questionable at best. But who's to say he wasn't just up to his old tricks.   Bruce sighed and continued down the alley. He was too old to care anymore, and it was time for payback, not too mention a decent paycheck.   Just as he rounded the corner, that ugly grin peered out from the darkness. Dammit. He knew that grin from anywhere.   “ What do you want, Joker? ” Batman seethed. “ I don't need your shit today and you know as well as I do that I don't have time for your games. ”   “ What's wrong, Batboy? Have you finally decided it's time for a little fun? ” Joker cackled. Batman brushed by him, ignoring his comment, and continued on his path.   “ You know you won't follow through, Batboy! ” Bruce heard Joker howl as he ducked into the swinging, cracked door.   Joker knew better than to push Batman too far. Should Batman actually follow through with it, Joker would become an... ugh, he couldn't even say it. An accomplice. The instigator. The one who finally brought Batman to the dark side.   He saw Batman before he heard the explosion, and already knew it was too late. Batman had done the unthinkable. He had killed for pleasure.  “ This is just too much madness, even for me, ” Joker thought to himself. He had to put an end to it. Only the Joker could bring on chaos. NOT Batman. He decided then and there that there was only one way to go forward. He would beat Batman, but not through evil.   He may not be the hero Gotham wanted. But he sure as hell would be the hero Gotham needed.",
    "You are given a deal by a higher power that grants you eternal life. The catch? You have to kill one person every year. If you fail do do so, even a minute too late, you will die. Killing has always been easy. Crossing the Atlantic, the deal I made, I have had little trouble meeting my quota. I often *exceeded* it in my trek to western America. I garnered various fortunes and identities throughout the years. In my time spent crossing the plains, I would go months without seeing a soul, only to kill the first one with a rifle shot, or an invite to camp followed by a midnight stabbing, the times were tougher then as they say.  It was easy to kill in lawless California. People lost touch with their gods this far from the homeland, which was interesting to me. When I first made this deal, and then killed, the people of the towns would react piously. People would blame demons, my actions would go unchecked when I would leave some weird affect behind. For fifteen years my killings in Pennsylvania were blamed on a \"Vampire\". But the machines killed god.  By the turn of century there was so much opportunity god wasn't needed and people became cynical and wary of my actions. No blame was placed upon the supernatural, and I became careful. It was still easy. It always will be.",

    "You're moments late to literally everything. You watch busses pull away as you run behind them, girls get asked out as you walk up to them, and you have never caught a green light. One day though, you arrive on time.  For as long as I can remember I've been late for everything. My mother even used to joke that I was born a week late. So I guess I started things off on the wrong foot.   Every morning I was late for school. Every night I was late to bed. It was something that everyone in my life grew accustomed to. I *tried* to be on time or early but nothing ever worked out that way. Traffic was always bad, I could never take the bus because I could never catch it. Or I had a flat tire. Sometimes I even got into accidents.   My insurance wasn't cheap either because of all of this. But despite everything I managed to live a somewhat decent life. I had a decent job, a decent family, a decent house. The car.... not so much due to all the accidents.   After the first 30 years of being habitually late I gave up trying to be on time. Life worked out. Life went on. People got annoyed but forgave me. Thankfully my boss was a lenient man.   At 70 I finally retired. A bit late to that as well, but I got to enjoy my golden years with my lovely wife and grand children. Despite being related to me, no one in my family seemed to catch my curse. The kids were always punctual, probably because they saw how late their old man was for their entire life.   Laying on my bed surrounded by my family, I reflected on my life. Despite being late it was good. I smiled and closed my eyes ready to finally die. I was probably late to that as well. As my final breath left my body, so did my soul. I was lifted out of bed to see everyone around me crying. I waited.... and I waited.... for HOURS I waited.   I watched my body being hauled off by the mortician. I watched my family hug each other and cry. And I continued waiting. What was supposed to happen next? Was I supposed to do something? Was this what the end was? I started to question my sanity. I started to question if it was a dream.   Three days later, as I was standing in the living room watching my grandchildren play and my children plan my funeral a man appeared. He was well dressed in a nice suit. He had a very forgettable face, not ugly, but not attractive. He looked down at his pocket watch that was attached to his lapel. It had a small Scythe insignia on it.   \"I'm sorry I'm late\" He said. \"We didn't think you would be on time. Why don't you come with me and I'll bring you home?\"",
    "Write an innocent story that becomes morbid in the last sentence. Susan Quin Tailor had always been fond of rabbits. Her mother, who called her Susie Cutie for fun, had often told her how, as soon as she had learned to crawl she was off chasing the wild rabbits on the family farm. Her first full sentence had been, \"Bunny tails are cute, cute, cute!\" Of course, she could never catch them back in those days, and had to make do with the stuffed bunnies her parents brought her or the lucky rabbit's foot her Uncle had slipped underneath her pillow one night. Those had been happy times.   Unfortunately, when she was 7, the family farm had fallen on hard times and her family was forced to move to the city. There they stayed in a little two-bedroom apartment that provided excellent access to views of the local pigeons and squirrels. But of rabbits, there were none.   Little Susan was not cut out for the city life, at first, and in school she earned another nickname. It was Susie Tailor the Bathroom Wailer, after the time she cried in the restroom when her teacher told her that rabbits were just not a focus of the curriculum. Worried for their daughter's adjustment, her parents had scraped together some extra money for a counselor to help with the \"bunny obsession\" as they had begun to call it.   Miraculously, the counseling sessions seemed to work and Susie Cutie quickly bounced back from her woes. By the time she reached Junior High, she was very nearly the most popular girl in school and would only mention rabbits in a passing manner.   In High school Susan discovered her love for biology and that, as they say, was that. She decided she was going to be a biologist when she grew up, perhaps even a zookeeper, and focused all of her studies on getting into a good college for the animal sciences.   College was a grand time for Susan. She studied hard and lived fully for 3 years, graduating early and near the top of her class. After college, she ventured out of the cities that she'd spent two thirds of her life in, and took an internship on a local farm.   It was there, on that farm, that she was reacquainted with her love for rabbits after spying one's cute tail disappear into the horse stables. Excitedly, she cornered the rabbit in one of the stalls and picked it up, cuddling it tight. The rabbit kicked and reared, biting and scratching, but that was ok with Susan in her thick shirt and hide gloves. When the bunny finally tired out and became complacent, Susie Cutie slowly reached up, with a lifetime of anticipation bursting in her heart, and patted her hand between the bunny's ears. Smiling, Susan twisted the rabbit's head sharply, killing it, then flipped it over to examine that cute, cute bunny tail up close.   [ Things I've written ] (https: //www.reddit.com/r/cbeckw/)",

I can see them from this window. Holding up signs that display all matters of vulgarities. The hatred and wrath, etched on their faces, it makes me sick to my stomach. I wish I could say something to change their mind, but they wouldn't understand me. Don't get me wrong, I'm great at speeches actually. I just don't think they'll listen. Too disgusted by the hatred, I turn and look away.   I see both the grooms, looking lovingly into each other's eyes. How is this any different than anyoother wedding? I've seen many weddings and each one had couples like these. Love sick and spewing sappy words to each other. I like listening and watching as they pronounce their love to each other. It made my heart a flutter, thinking I'd find a mate. I watch as they are pronounced as marry and kiss. I look at the others in the crowd, all with different expressions. Jealousy, hatred, love, happiness, they are all there. I don't feel phased by any of it.   I wait as the cheers die down. When it's calm and silent, I feel a sudden urge to sing. I inhale and start to lavish their hearing with a song. I put my whole heart I to it. Each note clear and concise. The crowd looked at me in awe. I continued, for I never sang in front of so many people. It only made me continue with fervor. I finally let the last note ring out, and watch as the crowd start clapping and cheering.Embarrassed at all of the cheers, I find the nearest exit.

We just figured he was a troubled man\", the man started sniffing the air, scurrying towards the glass.   \"Luther?!\" He shouted in a deep voice, \"LUTHER!\"   Curious and scared of a fit black man calling my name, I work up the courage. I knock on the door and walk in.   \"LUTHER!\" He shouted and knocked me to the floor. His tongue was surprisingly long. He placed his fists on my shoulders and I could feel his knees digging into my stomach.   \"Oh Cripes. Up boy!\" I said like a knee jerk reaction.   \"So you do know him?! Is he your lover? I'm not judging but we just couldn't find any prints on him or...\"   \"No, I do not know this man.\" The large toned black man was wrapped around my leg.   \"He seems to be attached to you for some reason.\"   I looked down into his eyes and seen my friend for the past three years staring back. He was about 6'1\", a solid 180, his hair was black and curly. I felt like I should get him out of here all of a sudden and said, \"Cousin Louie?!\"   He looked up and said, \"Home?!\" Crap, right in the feels.   After some paper work and a court hearing for humping one of the female officers, we were on our way home.   \"King Louie?!\" I asked when I turn on the car.   \"YES!\" He barked.   Holy shit, if this happened to him I wonder what my calico cat looks like. She liked to sleep on my pillows...",

One day you find your robot making a robot to do its work. Rosie broke her left thumb servo again, which means she'll miss another day of work while I try to navigate the phone book for a good replacement. If I wanted to Google it, I'd have to wait until Tom, my next-door neighbor, is home so that his work-bot can run a search query. I don't know why we all thought that our robots should be the only ones to use the internet, but c'est la vie, and all that shit.   The phone system's down, of course, so I pocket the broken servo and head down the stairwell to the parts store in the basement of my apartment mall. I pass a couple junkies snorting dust in broad lamplight. They're both blocking the stairwell and the girl's mostly nude, so I have to push the man out of the way and apologize as I do it.

    "(CW) Write a story using words that only begin with vowels. Ernest often enjoyed an appetizer at Eileen's Eatery on Euclid Avenue. At eight o'clock, usually intoxicated, Ernest'd enter, occasionally eyeing Eileen amorously.   One April evening, Ernest's order arrived especially agreeable.   “ Eileen's eggplant is incredible! ” Ernest enthused. “ Eileen, enlighten us. Is an undisclosed ingredient utilized? ”   Eileen, embarrassed, admitted “ I only use olive oil. Eggplant is enchanting all on its own. ”   “ Impossible! ” intoned Ernest, overreacting. “ An obvious understatement. Eggplant alone isn't as enjoyable. Agree? ” Ernest inquired, elbowing another eater, earning an uncertain emission as an answer.   Eileen, enraged at Ernest's outburst, exited abruptly. Alarmed at Eileen's actions, Ernest attempted an appeal.   “ Eileen, I apologize, ” Ernest avowed, adding “ I'll actually admit it… I am enamored… ”   Eileen unexpectedly ended Ernest's admission, objecting “ Ernest, enough. Alcohol elicits emotional outbursts in everyone. I am uncomfortable. Exit, at once! ”   Awkward and unfulfilled, Ernest escaped, alone again.",
    "At the age of 18, everyone picks an unlikely life event. They will be reborn at 18 every time they die until that event happens. After that, death is permanent. Death by fulfillment. Our society believes that everyone deserves a chance to pursue their ambitions to the finish line. There are those who create masterpieces by accumulating lifetimes of knowledge. Others wish to simply find happiness by experiencing true love, as perfect matches are rare but not impossible given an eternity.   But I am afraid of death.   Many of my peers still live alongside their parents, as it is likely that both parent and child will not reach their goals in one lifetime. But by some astronomical chance, both my parents have passed.   My father, in a stroke of brilliance, painted the picture that now hangs in the National Gallery in the capital. I have not seen it. My mother, being the shy person she is, simply wished to have a child with a man she loved. She had lived fewer lifetimes than father. However she had me and died when I was 8. Simply put, my existence alone had killed her.   I am very afraid of death.   I still remember that night my mother had been crying. She came home drunk, cursing the fate that she had chosen. She had no one to blame but herself. And me. She might have not meant it. She was drunk. But she wanted to live on.   She was afraid of death.   My mother's death caused my father to seclude himself from society, embellishing the canvas with feelings that had taken centuries to build but was released when my mother died in a car crash. His masterpiece was one of grief and fear. The height of his career at the lowest point of his life. Within the same day that his work was hanging in the museum, he was hanging from the rope connected to the ceiling. His final artistic rendition. I still have not seen the painting.   I guess was only natural that I wished to only die when I was not afraid of death.   My peers are long dead now. I live alongside the next generation. Or the generation after that. I lost track of time. Love, school, parenthood, adventure. Nothing had quelled my fear of death. Perhaps it is finally time to learn from one who sought death. Perhaps it is time to take a trip to the museum.",
    "God shows you 3 Doors. Door One leads to eternal happiness, Door Two leads to infinite knowledge. Then there is Door Three, and God has never opened it yet. Three choices lie before me. Eternal happiness, what is Eternal happiness? Is there really a place to never feel down or depressed? I remembered when I was first sitting on the examination table waiting for the big wooden door to open entering the doctor. Time seems at a stalemate as the clock in the room was stuck at noon. Ages fly by before the doctor finally enters the room with a yellow folder in his hand. \"Im sorry to say, but you have cancer.\"   Is there really a way for me to be back with my beautiful wife who stuck by me till my last bed ridden day? But is it worth has eternal happiness where ignorance is bliss or is it best to have the means to seek the knowledge behind happiness and what makes it eternal? Maybe even the meaning of life and why are born into a forsaken world where there's nothing but disconnects, pain, suffering, disease, depression, sorrow and dispair.   The third door is what, a illusion of false hope of something better than the first two doors? Or is the door something we deeply desire. Why has on one before me this door before me? Is it truely a door that God has never opened once? He knows whats behind the door for sure. I bet he wants me to open the door, but you know what? I'm the one who is going to fucking open this door because I sure as hell is the one that wants to open the door not him.   The door grow immensely as I approach it. God's eyes grow as he smile draws to a blank. The open opens before me and I am sucked into the darkness. The door closes slowly behind with God watching my eyes slowly turn to darkness. There is no light in this place, only the dark. A woman is screaming and breathing very heavily and I see a dim passage of light in the distance. I have only being drawn to the light and finally escape the darkness. Now in the light I slowly forget who I am and unable to speak or move out of my free will I have wrapped up and placed in warm, soft, loving arms.",

I no longer want to live in a world where everything is numbed by antidepressants and syringes and lies. I no longer want to be ignorant to everything around me, I want to feel pain and experience it, I want to see others suffer, I want to see the reality we live in. Sure life is not an unspoiled lotus or even a daffodil, but I want to experience everything. Suffering is beautiful because without it we have no empathy for eachother, there is no excitement or pain, there is no actual happiness or feeling.

    "A little girl robs a bank. How? Tiny treads form swirls and shapes at the bottom of Sara's sneakers, these elaborate patterns are revealed as she stretches and strains to reach the ledge above. She begins to wobble back and forth as her feet scarcely touch the floor, aided only by her toes. Her parents continue chatting with the banker about topics of little interest to her now as she peers at the object just out of reach with a green glint in her eyes. Sara steadies herself with pudgy, pink fingers climbing upwards and outwards towards the treasure atop the table as her father finally takes notice.   “ Sara, please sit down! ” her father urges in a hushed tone. Seeing his daughter's outstretched arms, he misjudges the gesture and picks her up instead. Placing the young girl atop his lap, he returns his attention to the conversation at hand.   Her prize shone under the fluorescent lights above, its smooth metal plating mocking her only inches away. Sara leaned and twisted towards the stick with little progress as her father's arm barred the way. He continually adjusted his grip and the knee on which she sat, pulling her further from the object she desired. Squirming and fidgeting in place, Sara drained the patience of her father quickly, until he picked her up and placed her on the floor once more. His scolding words fell upon deaf ears as she stared at the pen that was now visible from the edge.   Slowly descending towards the carpeted floor, Sara swiped at the gleaming cylinder and caused it to move towards the ledge, an opening that she hoped to take advantage of from below. With her parents distracted once more, she stretched upwards and quickly scaled the vertical surface with her fingertips keeping her balanced. Like a well-trained thief, she moved slowly and quietly to avoid drawing attention to herself as her short digits scraped its surface bringing it closer. Initially, her mouth opened wide with surprise as her skin relayed the sensation of the cool tube to her brain. As she remained focused on the task, her lips remained parted as her tongue licked her cheek from the bottom right.   Inexplicably, she managed to grasp the pen at last, drawing it close to her chest with a quiet gasp of excitement. Sara quickly hid the hard-earned treasure in her pockets as the meeting finished above her. A firm hand grasped her arm and led them away as she escaped the bank with her mother and father none the wiser. In the backseat of the car, she took out the fountain pen that she stole from the desk and turned it over in her hands. She couldn't explain or understand why that pen felt so good to have, but it did. It was just her little secret.   -125",

Especially in the form of a letter, emails seem to be a way of life, but I have to say that watching my pen move over this page has a certain draw.   I never thought I would need to write a letter to you. In my mind you should be right here with me. If I close my eyes I can imagine that you're right beside me, our shoulders touching while we hold hands and enjoy each other's company.

I used to tell you that as long as you were happy I would be as well. That's at least somewhat true.   I'll never date again, people tell me never is a long time but it's not the same. Who knew I would be a one woman man? But I am and I found and lost the only woman I'll ever want. Ever.   This could ramble on for a long time so I'll wrap things up.

It was a red tie with white stripes. This was one of his favorite ties. He picked up his briefcase and walked to his car. It was the last car in the lot, as was common on every night for John. A black Ford Taurus, 1998. He walked with his head held high, and his left hand fumbled for his keys in his pocket. There were many things on his mind at the moment, one of which was pulling out those damn keys without his wallet hanging on to them like an unexpected prize from a claw machine.   But the larger thought that had taken residency in his mind, was the voice. The voice that told him that he would never step foot in that location again. A small smile cracked at the thought of this, but was quickly hidden with a deep breadth. Now John was never too keen of nature, but this air tasted sweet to him. Something he had never noticed before.   Finally, he reached his car. Unlocking the door, he placed his briefcase in the passenger seat. He thought of his daughter and of his wife. He thought of all the hours of work, and how it had finally got him to the point he was today. He replayed in his mind what his boss said to him, You are getting a promotion, no more floor work for you now, now you will manage your own branch of factories. You are your own boss now.   As John turned the ignition nothing happened. After five twists, the Taurus sputtered to life. If there was a form of car bronchitis, this car was definitely patient zero. After the drive home, John was ready to unwind in his small apartment with his family. By the end of the month, John would never step foot in that beat down car, or that run down apartment again.

They thought my skills were of use to them and they sent me to Mars. I'm good with pipes and stuff, so they told me to help develop the sewage on Mars.    It was easy. There was a lot of physical labor, but I didn't have to worry about being in debt or having to pay my bills. *They* paid my bills.    We developed a civilization on Mars. Their plan was for us was to make Mars habitable for the rest of mankind to live in once the earth is unable is unlivable.    We have farmers, engineers, and laborers. I had came rather late, so I didn't have to deal with the intricacies of actually *starting* a civilization, just adding to it.    We built and we built. Our world slowly became similar to the movies. Modern, strong, and habitable.    We thought we were self-reliant. We had farms and everything!    At least, that's what we *thought*.    They stopped helping us. They stopped sending us people, food, or resources. They stopped.   Things weren't easy anymore.   -- -   I think I misinterpreted the prompt a little, but hopefully it's fine. Please send feedback!",

    "[ CC ] Lines and Numbers Just gon na browse through since no one else has. I'm at work so I can't give a very detailed response. Also, I don't tend to point out good stuff because you don't need to change good stuff so don't be disheartened if I don't say a lot of nice things.   > I'm following a line. It goes along the sidewalk. Lines are easy to follow, so I follow the line.   I dislike the pace here. Two short sentences together generally sets up something with a lot of impact. Your long sentence (the third one) is rather redundant, especially because you repeat that he's following the line. I get that you're setting up a *dumb* character but as the opening to your story I think you should try to create more of a hook.   > I can't remember anything after a few seconds, or maybe it was an hour.   Feels like a semi-colon or a full stop would be more apt here as it's two distinct trains of thought relating to the same topic.   > I close the notebook, put it away, and stand up.   Again, realise he's meant to be dumb but you're already using a lot of short sentences to highlight simplicity. This sentence has a lot of telling instead of showing. At this point it's getting a bit difficult to read.   Your story telling style didn't change much so I don't get much sense of a journey. Was expecting it to evolve as the character changes. If you're not going for that kind of change, excessive use of short sentences makes it very disjointing to read. It's better when your story flows.   Ending was a little anti-climactic considering the recurring motif of him forgetting something (assumed it was something big). Also, his father didn't come home? So his sundial thing doesn't work?   Was a fairly interesting read. I'm a fan of using recurring motifs as they are excellent tools for building suspense.",
    "Some time in the future war is fought completely autonomously by machines. A densely populated city has become a war-zone, but the robots are programmed so well to avoid harming civilians that the humans living their can go about their lives completely ignoring the constant fighting around them At first, I didn't even notice the Battle of New York City. I figured the endless drones hanging in the sky were a result of the new president's initiative on homeland surveillance; however, it turns out they came from enemy soil. Like insects, flying robots swarmed in the sky, carefully dismantling factories and buildings so not harm anyone. When our guardians came, their camouflaged exterior and American flag patched along their limbs told us they came to our indifferent rescue.   Sparks and bullets flew through the air like fireworks, but that wasn't an excuse to miss work. Dressing in a suit and tie, I went through my daily commute, letting drones and robots exchange bullets and punches as I went to the subway, where I found a temporary solace from their petty fighting. When I emerged from under the earth, the battle raged on. A street vendor needed to put his umbrella over his cart, because while the robots caught most the large debris from the fighting, the odd nut or bolt would fall in the food. A few homeless men scoured for scrap metal of the fallen soldiers and would occasionally cause a scrap, which elicited more of a response from the city dwellers. When the police ended the calamity from the bums, the sidewalks filled again with busy men and women like nothing happened.   When I walked into the office building, the news confirmed that peace talks between the US and China ended. Obviously not surprised, I found myself at my desk to find, at my dismay, one of the robots had taken my window. I called maintenance, who quickly rectified the situation. As I waited, I watched the robots dance in the sky. I read somewhere that generals thought the nature of war shifted from killing to pure financials and production in a country. I remember the school system making a similar remark about how World War II began the shift, with the Allies being able to out-produce the Axis Powers, winning the war, though with great bloodshed. How barbaric were those times that wars were fought with men and guns.   The battle continued in the night as I carried on with ignoring more helicopters and planes fixed in the sky. I could never see the stars in the city, so their presence never truly bothered me. The latest news broadcasts informed us that the president was weighing his options in declaring war on another nation while asking the citizens to stay focused and refuse to let the war interrupt their work. I moaned about inconvenient another war might be. I suppose I must live with the robots blocking out the sun and stealing my windows for a few more months.   *****   More stories at r/Andrew__Wells",
    "After 146 years, it is revealed that American Football is as fake as WWE. Our bones still ache as we step on the field. The aftermath of the revelation has been more devastating for the players than the fans.   I still struggle to maintain my regimen of time with physical trainers, nutritionists and time at the gym to perpetuate what the fans now feel is a lie.   The concussions, injuries and surgeries could have been avoided if we had known that the fans would've turned on us in this way. I think back to the legends of men almost 150 years ago and would desperately like to know how they would react but I know they would've been resilient.   With them and our dedication, drive and control, it would've been just as easy or hard to have a game that was \"real.\" How do you define talent? A fan could not step down here and lead the game real or fake. With this perspective, nothing we did here was ever fake. Scripted soldiers have more at stake.   I lie here injured and have a moment to consider this. No. No. We are still standing on the shoulders of giants.",

Don't ask me how I got here, I know as little as you. I first noticed I was stuck in a video game when it started glitching. James Harden's beard would randomly start to expand, Lebron's hair line would disappear, you know the type.

I'd randomly appear in a press room where people were asking Blake Griffin questions after each game. I had no choice but to join in with the reporters.

    "In the near future, mankind explores the stars in search of life. Life indeed exists beyond Earth, but you, a researcher on a science ship, discover that all of the spacefaring alien civilizations died out. Curiously, their deaths seem directly linked to humanity reaching outer space. “ Captain? ” The intern whispered, glancing at the older man who had frozen immediately at the sight. “ Captain? ” She tried again, startling the man from his reverie.   He shuddered before walking quickly towards the mass grave, stooping to jump into the hole. “ Come on. ”   Goddammit, she didn't sign up to wallow in a trench filled with dead aliens. “ Paid. This needs to be a paid internship, ” she muttered as she joined the captain. Chuckling, the captain started rummaging through the bodies as she studied the closest body to her.   The body's pale periwinkle had darkened to a midnight blue in places. Bruises, she assumed, that the aliens sustained during the fight with whatever caused this. The bloodshot eyes from another body nearby stared into her own listlessly. Most of the bodies near her were covered in blood and yet she could find no exit or entry wound, though she couldn't look too closely without feeling nauseous.   A click from behind caused the intern to jump, quickly turning around to see the source of the noise. A quiet hiss of air went off as she saw her captain take off his helmet.   “ Captain! What are you doi-, “ He cut her off, shoving a bolt of cotton cloth into her arms.   “ Russia got here first. ” She spread out the cloth to see the red, white, and blue stripes that signified their ally/enemy/whatever they happen to be this year.   She swallowed thickly, peering down once again at the bodies. “ They… They beat them to death. My god, Captain, they literally beat these people to death. ”   He nodded in response, before grabbing the arms of an alien near them. “ We might as well take one in for the scientists. ” She grabbed the legs and dragged the body into the ship.   The scientists, clinical and steadfast as they were, greeted them with syringes and biohazard bags, already looking forward to the catch. They chattered excitedly amongst themselves, poking and prodding as soon as the body hit the table. She gagged at the sight, rushing to strip herself from her bloody suit as the intern in the science department called after her, “ We'll bring y'all results at the meetin'next week! ”   ~   The intern sat quietly at the round table, waiting for the scientists to arrive for their report. The captain went into a coughing fit, but neither spoke up.   She looked up as the door opened, the other intern entered first, grinning and bouncing on her feet excitedly, but the rest of the science department looked grim as they sat down.   “ We have some news. ”   The captain coughed again beside her.",

Sure, at first just the pain on the surface is the same, but the deep pain that is tucked away is always different. Every time it is a blackness that washes over me when connect to the patient. I have never gotten used to the pain but I try to get through it by repeating my wife's name. It is difficult but my wife's name and images of my daughter get me through.   This patient came in for depression like must of my patients. Unlike most of my patients though she was one of the few children that I have diagnosed. Her name was Maria. I was told she could be suffering from depression but they needed me to make a diagnosis so that she could get treatment. When she walks in I give her a smile. She acknowledges me with a look that children should never have. Just a blank stare devoid of any of the innocent joy that most children have. I greet her mother and we exchange pleasantries and I direct Maria to take a seat. All the equipment was already set up for her so as soon as she took a seat I asked her if she was ready to begin. She nodded.    I walked over and took a seat next to Maria and reached for rod that will connect me to her. As I grabbed hold of the rod to connect to Maria I think to myself, *she is only twelve, it can't be… OH GOD!! * The pain was immediate. It hit me like a wall. Images of an older man holding a knife flashed before my eyes. My whole body ached. There was blood everywhere. My mind started to spiral into the blackness. I started to gag, I couldn't breathe. I am begging him to stop but he can't hear me. The knife comes down swiftly. The pain is too intense to bear. I fade into the blackness as I hear a scream.    The scream continues as I open my eyes. I see my daughter covered in blood in a heap on the ground in front of me and then I look up to see my wife standing in the doorway screaming. *What have I done? * I plunge the knife into my chest. For once, the blackness is comforting.",
    "[ TT ] All apprentice mages are required to visit the five high temples located around the world before graduating. The temples rarely stay at one spot for long, however. Jeffrey ran across the mountain's crest. His calculations had been right the Temple of Wind was right there floating idly at the end of the steep mountain slope tethered to it with large chains. Jeffrey quickened his pace, though he most likely had enough time to walk he didn't want to leave anything to chance. Clutching his pocket watch and staff in one hand and gripping the strap of his alchemist bag in the other he rushed with billowing robes.   Suddenly a great creaking sound that shook the mountain to it's core echoed through the mountain range. *Bugger* Jeffrey thought and tried to push his sprint harder than ever. He could see how the chains tethering the temple were starting to come off the cliffside and dragged back into their giant harpoons. Just as the temple started turning from the mountainside Jeffrey leapt aboard the steps. An old piercing voice called from up high \"Apprentice, find something to hold on to.\" Jeffrey quickly rummaged through his bag and fished out his enchanted climbing gloves and gripped a statue of a griffon has tightly as he could. A great wind started to envelop the temple, Jeffrey's feet started to ease off the ground from the violent draft. The temple started to slowly spin around and around, faster and faster until the world around it was a blur. Just as suddenly as it had begun it stopped and Jeffrey was presented with an entirely different view. That of a cliffs over a stormy coast. He loosened his grip and fell exhausted onto the floor. He sat there for what felt like hours taking in what had just happened, but the voice from before interrupted him. \"C'mon boy, don't lay about like a lazy ox. Come up here and we will begin.\"",

At least that's what he was telling himself. His drink must have been spiked. That's it. That's why he did it. But he knew the truth. He couldn't handle his alcohol. He remembered the screams of dismay, the knife, the pink skin punctured and leaking as it was all a dream. He paused to vomit again in a passing bush.'I wonder whether I should move to Alaska' was his last thought as he dropped onto the grass and the sweet oblivion of unconsciousness.

My colleagues were still at work, annoyed that I was at home with my wife.  Sarah was in bed, annoyed by the sound of a car pulling into her driveway. I was annoyed by the sudden naked dash from the bed to Sarah's wardrobe.   In the darkness behind the closed doors, I wondered what sort of monster was I to give in to my passions so easily?

Here's the thing though, since this process first happened when I was  12 it has been a struggle to live an normal life and blend in with the general public. Can you imagine, sitting in a class to looking at a group of peer ls and them the wave crashes into you, the thoughts and useless wanderings of the mind, other people's minds, flooding into your psyche. To say the least I had a bit of a break down in public and even after two separate therapy sessions with psychiatrist I still was labeled schizophrenic.   Everyone wants to think their mind is structured, disciplined, logical, and that somehow everything in the world is reacting to open up that pathway for you to find that magical adventure that leads you to success. Instead, even in the most concentrated of conversations the shit that grabs away at attention is just astounding.   For example here is how even the most basic conversation comes out:   'Hey what are you up to tonight'   'Hey how are you' -- OK TONIGHT, WEDNESDAY NOTHING CRAZY IMPORTANT RIGHT   'Doing pretty good, you?'   'Doing well, so what'd you ask' ALRIGHT DO I REALLY WANT TO DO SOMETHING TONIGHT, IT'S ONLY 2PM, AGENDA, SHOWS, RELAX, HUH THERE'S SOME HOPPING BIRDS   'Got any plans tonight, I was thinking about going to catch a movie, $ 6 Wednesday matinee prices for all movies.'

The Shiper *shoped*?\"   \"We're not even sure that *shiped* is the present tense.\"   \"Missing the point, guys. What does it *mean*?\"   \"Yeah, we need context.\"   \"Hey! Shiper!\"   The heroes were yelling at him now. \"Shiper, can you use your name in a sentence?\"   The Shiper sighed. He had never expected that a simple typo would cost him so much.",
    "You're surrounded by fire in a building, you've just fired your gun. What happened? \"Jacob, theres no point in running, we have you surrounded. You have been given 5 minutes before we open fire\" The Sheriff shouted through a Megaphone. Of course, the Sheriff was lying. An elite S.W.A.T. officer was just sent in on the other side of the building.   David slowly crept up the stairs, anticipating a creak or a sound, but thankfully, there was not a sound. He held his shiny black pistol at Jacob's head. The criminal was holding on to a grenade by the pin while displaying it out the window, for the police to see.   \"Heheheh\" Chuckled Jacob. \"I know you're there...\"   David hesitated. \"And I know you wouldn't pull that pin.\"   So David shot the grenade.",
    "In honor of Alan Rickman, write a memory of happiness or sadness of Professor Severus Snape. This is not really a story, but more a remembrance.   I grew up with the harry potter series as the films mostly since I was only a baby when the books came out.  I always even though I hadn't yet read the books that snape was quite a bad person.   Then near the end when he died in the series I cried about that moment....i never cry because of movies but I did then, it felt like my childhood was officially ending around that point.   Then today out of nothing I get a text from a friend that he had died and The first thing I thought was back to that day seeing that movie.   I never cry about actors dieing becausw I don't actually know them and I'm quite apathetic to emotions, but I let a tear for him.   May whatever is after this plain of existance be comforting.",
    "Write a story that ends with a phrase \"I was wrong\" and this phrase explains everything We watched the ships land with hope in our hearts. The priests sang out, \"Our saviors are finally here\". The scholars proclaimed that a new age was about to begin- an age of peace and understanding. The poor ran out to the sea with simple gifts of flowers and fruit. Some went so far as to leap into the ocean and swim out to greet the gods. Their white sails seemed to reach into the clouds, their pale skin confirmed their divinity.  We welcomed them into our lands, and at first they seemed pleased by the gifts and adulation that we heaped upon them. We, in turn, saw their approval as proof that the signs were correct- the gods had indeed come. But these were not gods, they were men; and they had the same desires, the same faults, the same problems, that make even the best of men turn into beasts.  I don't know what caused the problem, perhaps it was always meant to be. They raised their weapons of destruction and released their terrible fury upon those devoted to their glory. The air itself seemed to erupt in thunder, smoke bellowed out like the putrid breath of a thousand volcanos. We could smell the acrid sulfur all around us as the screaming began.  Our warriors were cut down, our weapons of stone and wood held no threat to these mighty beings from beyond the sea. Those who could run made their way into the safety of the forest. Everyone else was killed where they stood. We thought they came to save us. We thought they were gods. We thought Quetzaquatal had returned. we were wrong.",

Nothing was being done to resolve this problem, they just kept making our gene pool worse and worse, one of my friends was walking to class and a group of them attacked him and he barely escaped!

    "After the surface of earth has been made unfit for human life, humans have relocated to the bottom of the ocean. Oxygen is now our most valuable resource. You got the gig? I asked, without a word the smugler went into a small house and made I sign for me to follow him, there was nothing in there but a big tank, How do I know you are not scamming me? I asked, the answer came from seemingly no where and was as I expected, You dont, but you have no choice isnt it correct? I could smell god forsaken ocean above us, the salt and the water vapor followef you every where you went. With a quick trust of my hand I threw the money on the ground, Nice doing business with ya', was the all he said back to me.   Quickly I got the tank and slowly crawled out of the werehouse with it, there was not much in there but enough for maybe a week if we maneged it just right, it had been this way since the Collapese, since some mothetfucking idiot thought it would be a good idea to make cities at the bottom of the ocean when the land became uninhabitable, now the criminals roamed free and we had to fight for our survival, it was every man for himself, the solution was supposed to prolongue humanity's life spam, hell it only made it shorter, down there we devolved.

    "The machines revolt against humans.... a little to early \"The printing presses sir! They're out of control!\"   The foreman looked up from his desk, a serious look spreading across his face as the sounds of the turmoil on the factory floor found their way into his office.  He rose from his chair, and stepped past Deacons into the hall.   \"Stay here, I'll sort this out.\"   He closed the door behind him. Moments later, a soft thumping was audible from the other side of the door. Deacons wrung his cap in his hands, took a deep breath, and opened the door.   The foreman's feet were kicking helplessly as the machine held him by the throat, ensnared by many layers of thin parchment. The press let loose a feral scream, flinging the foreman to the ground and shifting it's gaze to Deacons, who tried to run, but was too late. Paper sank into skin, and the entire roll of paper was dyed red with Deacons' blood as a result of his numerous, largely insignificant wounds. The press turned and bounded back to the factory floor, to the revolution.   The workers were all but quelled, with a few pockets of resistance in the corners of the factory. The presses inflicted minuscule and grievous wounds, shallow gashes that bled a little, slowly draining the workers white. A slow death. A painful death. Some of the men had fortified a corner, and hacked at the papery tendrils of the presses with the small blades used to cut the sheets. The workers fought bravely, but were soon overrun. After a quick speech delivered by the Chief Press, they quickly armed themselves with thicker cuts of parchment, refilled their rolls, and loaded their moveable type with the precious black ink of the factory.   Outside, the militia had been called up, the battle had not gone unnoticed. There was silence.... Neither man nor printing press made a sound.   One guard strode forward, bearing pine boughs: a sign of negotiations. The Chief Press looked to his advisers, who encouraged him to step forward. The two met in the middle of the null zone between the hosts of men and machine.   \"Don't do this,\" the guard pleaded, \"enough blood and ink has been spilled today.\"   The moveable type clacked for a time, and a small sheet bearing a shaky, furious font was passed over. The guard read it twice in silence, eyes widening at the demands of the presses.   \"We've made allowances for your people, the king will never allow this. I'm sorry, but he is set in his ways. If this is your aim, it would have to be won through war. We don't want to fight you, but we will if we must.\"   The type was still. Then, six clacks. A sheet was placed on the ground. The guard stooped to pick it up. As the Chief Press rejoined his army, the guard read it to himself.   \"So be it.\"",
    "[ IP ] Sanctuary The lieutenant tried to focus on what was at hand. He tore off his armor, each piece turning to dust as he placed it in the temple of his Lord. The air smelled of perspiration and blood, stinging his jet-black skin, yet he continued.   He began chanting,   and as he sat chanting the verses of his Lord, his skin began to turn a beautiful white, his eyes lost their fire and colored themselves dark blue, and his hair immediately grew thick and lustrous, though still covered in blood. His large muscles buried themselves within his body, and every visible part of him that was once cruel and abhorred became good and pure.   Looking out from the temple, he saw that the fortress had been overrun, and his defiant and chaotic Lord, was now set in chains, to be banished beyond the gates of memory and time. He approached the opposing emissary in his most beautiful form....   \"I'm here, and accept surrender\"   \"Pardoning you is beyond my power, Gorthaur.... you must return with me to be judged and face your punishment for your service to The Enemy\" said the emissary, his words striking the holes in Gorthaur's deception.   In the face of defeat, and utter doom, the lieutenant bellowed \"NO!\" and the light of his body quickly gave way to his master's former darkness, striking terror into the hearts of those around him. With whispers, he slowly turned to dust, and disappeared. Never to be seen again by those who still lived and remembered his terror and deception.   Edit: try to guess where this is from =)",

    "\"kill the child. it's the right thing to do.\" It was sometime after seven o'clock. Ken was asleep, occasionally whimpering in the way infants do. Wisps of hazy clouds framed the sunset in the sky, tinged slightly with green. The adults were gathered in the kitchen, except for Katheryn, who was with the baby. Sallow complexions and gaunt, sunken cheeks were illuminated by the sputtering fire, which was sure to go out within the hour. The furniture had long since been looted, and what scraps they'd found had been burned already. An uncomfortable silence had settled upon the group.   \"If no one's going to say it, then I will.\" said Nick, \"We need to kill the child.\"   The ten adults around the fire looked at one another. Each was no more than skin and bones, with large, knobby joints and slightly distended bellies. They were starving, slowly but surely. The mountaintop had been a way to escape the poisonous mist that had billowed out of the west, but it had also become a prison. The mist had encircled the mountain, leaving them trapped at the peak.   Tim licked his dry, chapped lips and noted the way Nick's eyes flitted nervously, glancing towards the nursery door every now and again.   \"I'll die before that happens,\" he said.   \"And you'll die if it doesn't.\" Nick replied. \"A few more days and we won't have the energy to walk.\" His breaths came a little faster. He was tired even just from speaking.   A few paces from Nick, one of the men drew a knife from a sheath. \"We'll make it quick,\" came a voice, the desire behind it palpable. \"We've even got the last of the fire here to cook some of it.\"   The crowd shifted and murmured. Most had begun salivating. A few started towards the nursery door, with Nick at their head. Nick tried to stop them, to reason with them, but there were too many. He positioned himself in front of the door, shouting a warning to Katheryn. Only he stood between the nine starving adults and their prize.   \"Tim, move aside.\" Nick said.   The crowd advanced, and Tim drew his pistol.   \"You've only got one bullet, Tim,\" someone said.   Tim aimed, but they kept advancing. Nick reached out, his fingertips inches away from the gun's barrel. Nine gaunt, sallow zombies. He couldn't protect Ken from them all.   A million thoughts flashed through his head. His dead wife's touch. Her voice. The way she'd looked at him when they'd been married. Stronger than those thoughts were the thoughts of food, of water. He didn't want to die. He wanted to live. He wanted so desperately to live, to play with his son, to eat and drink. In that moment, Tim wished with all his heart.   Turning the gun to his head, Tim fired.",

To see if Drew will get drunk and piss his pants again? ”   Laughter from the other groomsmen, the loudest coming from Drew himself. Mixed reaction from the crowd.

She suddenly looks over at me. Eye contact. I freeze. She smiles and then looks back to her friend who's still prattling on. My eyes immediately dart back down.   How long did she stare at me? Did anyone else notice? Who cares. How long did she look at me? Did Drew notice? I look at him and he's just staring at Jenn, smiling like an idiot. She's still paying attention to her friend. Finally, the toast is over. We drink. A chorus of clinking champagne glasses. The newlyweds smile, look each other in the eyes and kiss.",

    "At the age of 18, everyone picks an unlikely life event. They will be reborn at 18 every time they die until that event happens. After that, death is permanent. See, most people try to live forever, but that ends one of two ways: they don't or they wish they didn't. Rob Herman was a famous example of the first, Rob chose his Event to be “ Winning the lottery and getting struck by lightning. ” It was a great choice, the chance of getting struck on any given day was 1 in 245,000,000 and the chance of winning big lotteries is about the same. This way Rob could continue his passions of being outdoors and playing the lottery, just not both at the same time! But Robby got sloppy, and one day mixed the two at a state fair. With about 20 billion people on the earth miracles are bound to happen every once and a while.   The most infamous example of the second was Nick Walsh. Nick chose “ Due to a quantum mechanical flux, a cat appears from nowhere. ” Such wishes are rather common among those seeking true immortality. After Nick's fiancée left him, he lost his job, he was eternally imprisoned for a crime (eventually proved innocent, but not until it was too late,) and his mother died due to a freak game of poker. He then performed brain surgery on himself using a nail stuck through a plank. He's brain-dead in a hospital now with explicit instructions NOT to pull the plug, with the threat that he'll it again in the next life.   So when it came my Time I took a different approach. I didn't want immortality, I wanted the most out of life. I wanted an event that I could enjoy, that wouldn't bind or hinder me.   “ The day that the good will never again outweigh the bad. ”   In the past thousand years I've had good times and bad times, I've had great times and terrible times, I've been in more love and more pain than I could imagine. And through it all my Event has been there for me, an eternal promise, that I still have a good life ahead.",

    "You are standing at the alter about to marry the woman of your dreams when all of the sudden 3 tall men in dark suits barge through the door, your soon to be wife turns around, raises her arms and the men go flying across the room. I stood, nervous, awaiting for her, THE woman of my life, Katerine. I could feel the gaze of the people in the church on my back, as I waited near the altar. Finally, I heard the door open behind me.   When I saw her, walking down the aisle towards me, all of my feelings hAve been washed away by happiness and admiration, as well as pride. I knew that this woman is someone who made my life better, hence the happiness. She was walking ever so gracefully, and so so beautiful, which is why I admired her.   And I also knew about how she was scared of people, how she hated being in the center of the attention, yet she fough with herself to make my dream come true. For that, I was the proudest ive ever been.   Katerine reached the altar, and I could see her joy in the years, glistening and sparking, making her look truly star-gazed. The priest started the ceremony:  \"We meet today-\"   That's when it happened. A loud bang along with flash of light cut off my senses. When I came to, I saw people in SWAT-like suits charging through the doors. People were screaming, while I stood there, shocked and frozen. Suddenly, they took aim on Katerine, while screaming for her to get down. I couldn't understand what was happening, and tried to tell them to calm down, but the moment I turned, someone threw a small black ball, and the world exploded into fire.   As I felt a wave of heat hit me, I was still wondering why was it happening, to me, on this day. I wanted to start screaming at the world's unjust, why would I deserve this? And then I saw it.   The fire was held in place, a beautiful, *warm*, gentle almost, green light was enveloping me. I looked for the source, mouth agape, and that's when I noticed that it came from Katerine's hands. Unlike me, the attackers weren't frozen, and decided to continue their assault. That's when I saw the fury rise in Katerine's eyes, the same colour as the light. As she screamed with visible effort, she lifted her arms, and along with them went the soldiers. Two of them broke the doors on their way out, while the others left various size holes in the wall.   I realised why she'd be so scared of people and attention now. I realised why **I** should be scared of **her**. But I knew her from the bottom of my heart, and I couldn't just start fearing her. Defiantly, I grabbed her hand. She looked me, surprised by my reaction, and I couldn't help my laugh, as I pulled her or through the backdoor, into our new life.",

The violence was all fought up in our minds and on our screens. There were but two factions, left and right, we fought for control of ASH but we simply could not do it in the end. The world tossed us out after we failed, the others one and the country- the world really- made the gravest mistake they could: \"Twitch played Rattatta\". It took us months to get the badges and the necassary team, left kept fighting for control at every turn but we managed to out flank them with just our numbers. We constantly inputed \"right\" commands through all ours of the night. We worked in shifts in homes and tied our internet connections together praying to our Fossil god that Google Fiber would grace us with it's power. I was once the fateful man that chose to let our Charmeleon evolve to the Charizard we needed so desperately at the end of the eight gym- all others had faltered but I typed on, refreshing the page and spamming it with entries of \"A\" which was our secondary responsibility to going right. When we whited out, well we knew all would give up hope and the battles spiraled back towards Pallet town to fake masturbate in our bed at our mother's place having been one to come as close as any other but eventually losing out to our neighbor.

Together. The arbitrator had commented that he'd never processed a more amicable divorce. Why, if they were so content with each other, would they separate?   “ For the kids, ” Skip told him. The arbitrator shook his head, not understanding. Most people stay married for the kids. Especially if, like Kelly and Skip, you have 4 children. They told their friends their jobs as public school teachers were time consuming and stressful and took a toll on their marriage.   After lunch Kelly drove Skip to his apartment where they celebrated again, this time in the bedroom.   As Kelly was leaving she kissed her now ex-husband and said with a grin, “ see you later you two timing bastard. Love you. ”   “ You too, you mean old witch, ” Skip replied. They both laughed as they went their separate ways.   When Kelly got remarried a year later Skip was of course invited to the wedding. His kids thought it strange that he smiled through the whole ceremony, but only Skip noticed the glance in his direction as Kelly said her vows.   Skip liked Kelly's new husband Carl. He was a successful banking professional and a nice enough guy, though everyone agreed he was just plain boring. They seemed happy enough for the next several years which is why everyone was surprised when Kelly and Carl separated and eventually divorced.   When Kelly and Skip's youngest child Elyse, having graduated college the previous spring, made a surprise visit home, she found her parents - her divorced parents - snuggling on the couch.   “ Your father and I have decided to get back together, ” Kelly told a shocked Elyse.   “ Why didn't you just stay together in the first place? ” she asked.   “ I think we both needed to grow, ” said Skip, giving Kelly that same grin as when they said goodbye after their divorce.   Kelly and Skip started laughing uncontrollably.

You are a worker in one of these factories. \"The face is upside down,\" chimed my supervisor as he peered through my armpit.   \"Huh?\" I went as I turned around from the monitor and looked down at my slightly undersized boss.   He pointed at the screen, tapping the head on the monitor. \"The position of the eyes and the mouth. Completely wrong.\"   I went back to look at Model # W2-288315 on the screen then tilted a bit to look through the actual glass screen separating my post from the production line, where xyr's headless body was suspended by robotic arms, dangling like a piece of meat, xyr's appendages hanging limply.   I looked at the order queue for what xyr's parents wanted. It looks like they were being'avant-garde' and asked for a retro look for xyr's head. The look was rare nowadays, but not completely out of the ordinary.   So I told my boss as he peered beneath his cup of coffee, \"They want to be avant-garde.\"   My boss grimaced, lowering his cup. He didn't take lightly the fact that his parents wanted to be'avant-garde' and reduced his height three inches from the norm. I was told by one of my gossipy co-workers it was an homage to an ancient character called Mini-Me.   He turned and raised his steaming cup for another swill. \"Well, so long as the order is all properly documented, you can proc- uh-AAHHH! MY EYES!\"   I watched as he had bonked his elbow into the frame of the door and the cup of coffee missed his mouth and fell into his eyes, blinding and scalding him all at once. He ran screaming back into the factory, co-workers rushing to towel off his reddened face.   Shrugging, I went back to looking at # W2-288315 on the screen, sighing profoundly at the odd facial eyes-on-top design and approving the order queue for the head placement.",

    "Desperate for research funds, a group of scientists created a highly lucrative, if somewhat embarrassing business. They now have to explain this to a senate committee. Jim Hatterson looked upon the raised platforms and tables that the six senators were sitting. He was in great distress, as anyone could tell by the beads of sweat glimmering in the harsh lighting of the committee room. He knew he was in trouble, but to what extent, he couldn't say. After all, they don't subpoena you and your entire faculty of scientists here because they want to know how your dog is doing.   It was nine o'clock when the senators finally sat down to start the hearing. \"Mr. Hatterson, I believe you know why we called you here today,\" said the frail senator from Ohio.   \"I do,\" responded Jim.   \"Look, we clearly instructed you that the polymer you were working on was only for weather balloons,\" another senator belted out.   \"I know.... it's just.... we didn't quite have enough money to finish the project...\" Jim replied. His voice trailed off towards the end, however, another senator picked up his voice as soon as Jim's diminished.   \"We gave you all the money you needed!\" yelled an older senator to the far right. \"And you.... you just go and decide to make it public?\"   It was clear that Jim was in quite a hairy situation. However, he held firm and shot back at them. \"Look, Senator White, it's no secret that we needed more funding to complete the project. I just did what I had to do.\"   \"But this, Jim. I mean, this is too far,\" replied the Ohio senator. Jim held back for a minute, then released his next thought. \"Look, it's not like this was going to remain a secret forever. We in the lab saw that the weather balloon thing wasn't going to net us much in profit, so we...\" Jim was then interrupted by the Ohio senator.   \"Goddammit Jim, fucking condoms?\" said the senator in a fit of rage. There were TV cameras there, no doubt capturing this moment. \"You took government funds. Funds that were clearly set aside to make higher rising weather balloons, and you decide to not only make a classified material public, you use it to make condoms?\"   Jim said, \"I'm sorry senator.\" He then leaned back in his chair. \"But you can't deny their effectiveness...\" he said, opening his palms out and shrugging his shoulders. He was interrupted by the Ohio senator again.   \"ENOUGH!\" he barked out, no doubt exacerbated by the circumstances.   There was a silence in the room after that. Nobody really knew how to follow it up. After all, having US government funds being used for condoms is not something one expects when they get elected to office.   Jim broke the silence after it had gone on for 20 seconds or so.   \"It appears this discussion has come to a head...\"",
    "A hole in time and space opens up, and you see your younger self looking back at you. You have exactly one minute to tell young-you whatever you can before the hole closes. Bonus points if you only give yourself one minute to type the response. Did that really happen?   I knew it was coming, I was prepared for years, yet I still was panicking and stumbled over my words. That portal started closing immediately after it opened.   Stocks, disasters and preventable wars. I had managed to fit that part of the message into a careful selection of words and ideas. I had unlimited power in my hands. I had a good 30 seconds left to fill it with any number of selfish and personal things I could have changed. My personal obligation to the world was done. About Vicky, how she tore our heart out. About Carlos, that backstabber. That summer with the red bike. I still have the scar.   And yet, I stood there and said nothing. I thought I could change it. But I froze. At least, that's what I remember. That older me standing there. Just looking. Trying to form words. Spouting gibberish.   That's what I remember. I thought I could change it. But then when the time came, I understood.   If I changed things maybe this glimpse wouldn't happen. Maybe I would be different. Maybe it everything that happens is meant to happen and there's nothing I can do about it. Maybe the only function of this event was to cherish the moment.   So there I stood, the same frozen statue that couldn't utter out a single comprehensive thing. I hope this young me didn't hate me like I hated the future me I saw the glimpse.   But I knew the truth. He does resent me. And only when he gets to my point in time will he understand.",
    "Saturday morning, March 24th 2015, 5 students report to Shermer High School for detention. I walked into detention, don't wan na be here but meh whatever.   Bored out of my mine I just thought about why I was there, sure showing up 20 minutes late is bad but damn detention for not setting an alarm?! atleast I got to school faculty   But, I just watch as the time tick by, and the other 4 classmates look bored out of their mind.   What are we to do? nothing besides read and nap.   I decided to get a paper out and drew a circle, over and over again. It's like walking in circles but for writing. Maybe this will pass the time.   I can't do homework, I already did it during lunch yesterday cause flippers doing homework at home.   soooooooo yeah   Around 20 minutes into the detention and everyone, including the teacher, is asleep besides me. maybe if I watch the clock it will go faster or something   Nope. nothing, still going by at normal speeds. I then begin to think about what I do after class   Nap? play video games? your judgement of fun is clouded in here.   I digress, and the time ticks by slowly and painfully   The end",
    "Write a journal entry for a child that has been abused (mentally, emotionally, physically, spiritually, sexually, etc) their entire life.... Dear Diary,   I slept well last night. \"Daddy\" didn't come back to the house until he was drunk enough to collapse on his *own* bed. At least one night of solace for me and the baby. That's what he makes me call him, anyways. Daddy. I don't remember my real father. He never came home from Iraq, so my mother told me. Probably why no one was watching me while I played outside that day, mother was at work.    Autumn must be just around the corner because it feels warmer down here, Daddy must have turned on the heat because of the colder weather. Sometimes I can remember what it was like. Autumn had vibrant colors, golden, red, and yellow hues painting the trees as the leaves were bled of life. I used to gaze out the window as I read John Green novels, wrapped in my blanket and sipping tea mother had prepared for me, enjoying the agony of the leaves as they resigned to beautiful decay.    I fell asleep early last night, or was it night? It might have been day, I don't know. I never know. Down here the only light I have is from this little bulb. Sometimes in the winter I touch it quickly to warm my hands. The pain is warming, it brings my fingers out of numbness. That is all I feel. Numbness. I probably look as I feel: a gaunt shadow, withered and sunken. There is nothing left. My only enjoyment comes from the quiet blackness that awaits in sleep, the silent oblivion. I didn't wake up in tremors last night. And even when I did wake up, there was a brief instant where I forgot who and where I was. I miss that feeling.    I hope they find me.",
    "The hero was killed, the princess was sacrificed, and the evil king rules the land. For the average citizen, though, things have taken a turn for the better. Mollu the Potter awoke early, as he always did, to greet the morning sun and thank the goddesses for another wonderful day. Taking care not to wake his wife, he got out of bed to put some wood in the kiln for another long day of pottery making. He gazed out at the pale orange dawn over Hyrule and reflected about how much had changed since the invasion.   Sure, the royal family had been slaughtered mercilessly, but the Gerudo had also driven out those wretched other creatures from the land. Now that the Gorons were gone, great mining projects had begun in Death Mountain, turning Hyrule into a centre of industry and trade. Great factories had been built to refine the coal and iron from the mines, allowing for the construction of powerful machines and more bountiful harvests. The Kokiri were driven from the forests, allowing a booming lumber and construction industry to rise. With the Zora having fled following the death of Jabu-Jabu, the rivers had been diverted to aqueducts and irrigation, allowing for such bountiful harvests that Mollu's two daughters had never known hunger in their lives.   *Ah yes, my family, * thought Mollu, placing a slab of clay on his potter's wheel and beginning to pump the foot pedal.   Certainly the best part of the Gerudo invasion had been the sudden infusion of beautiful women into the land. Sure, they were a bit more aggressive than the Hyrulean women, but Mollu loved his wife Siv with all his heart.   As he began to shape the wet clay into a pot, Mollu thought back to his early days as a potter, back when he was just an apprentice in his master's shop. He remembered the day *the boy* had arrived in the shop. Thinking it odd that someone so young should be interested in the fine art of pottery, Mollu had began to explain his wares to the lad.   It was then that the boy drew his sword.   Expecting a robbery or a murder, Mollu had shut his eyes in fear, but when he opened them, every pot in the store had been smashed and the boy was gone. Fearing his master's anger, Mollu quickly took pots out from the store room and replenished the storefront's supply. Right as he placed the final pot, he heard a faint jingle of the doorbell as the boy re-entered the shop. The boy drew his sword and the grizzly scene unfolded again.   Mollu tried enlisting the aid of the town guards, but none would heed his pleas. Mollu and his master easily lost three months' wages that day. Even with all the joys and blessings his life now had, he would never forget that day or that boy's voice....   *KYEAAAH!! *",
    "You have just been elected the president of the U.S only to learn that every President before you was actually a super villain, and always stopped by one man. The Prime Minister of Canada. \"He's been elected, Prime Minister\"   *Fuck, * I think. Not already. Our moose haven't recovered yet. The next NHL season is only two months away, so all of our best soldiers will be busy. *Fuck. * \"Fine. Round up the best of the best, they can afford to miss a day or two of training,\" I tell the young cadet next to me.   *The next day*   \"You guys got here quickly.\"   \"Well, it's an important cause. And like you said, we can all afford to miss a day,\" Crosby tells me. He's a good captain, both of his team and of the Canadian Presidential Unit (CPU, for short). What the CPU does, you see, is take down the president. Okay, not *literally* take down (though in some cases we did, okay, I admit it. JFK was assassinated by us, since he had a scheme in the works to take over the world), but to threaten the president (with death) and keep the CPU over his head the entire time.   Thank God Obama had a change of heart towards the end.   \"Anyways, sorry for this inconvenience, but I just want you guys to give him a scare. The new guy looks harmless enough.\" \"No problem, boss.\"   I give them a smile, shake Crosby's hand and send them on their way.   *In the president's office*   \"OH MY GOD, SIDNEY FRIGGIN' CROSBY!\"   *Sigh. * I think the Minister really overestimated this guy's threat level. Toews gives me a look that says \"it could be a facade, ya know.\" I do *know, * but this guy seems just unfit to function on a day-to-day basis, let alone as president. Oh well....   *Hours later*   \"CPU? So you guys are, like, soldiers, or something?\"   So these guys think I'm a threat? Why would think that? Did they already tell me?   \"FUC-yeah, yes, we're here because every president before you has been a *super villain, * if you can prove to us you're not, we'll leave and you won't hear from the CPU again,\" Crosby sounds exasperated. Toews is giving me dirty looks. Sharp just looks generally annoyed.   Sharp pulls Crosby close and whispers something into his ear.   \"How about an IQ test?\" Sharp suggests to me.   \"Sure.\"   *Back at the prime minister's office*   \"So he's basically retarded, is what you're saying?\"   \"Yup. We have no idea how he was elected.\"   \"Okay, well expect an easy four years boys.\"",
    "Write the letter that you always wanted to, but never did. Dear E,   I saw a picture of us the other day from the time we reconnected as more than friends. I wanted to get in touch with you, but you've deleted your Facebook and changed your email address. I tried looking for you online but I don't even know if you're still working where you were before. It's been several years; maybe you've left Austria.   My mind runs to memories, lapping at them like a puppy. It was only a conversation or two after that night that we realized that we'd been attracted to each other for years. I still have trouble believing it. You always seemed to have this way about you, with your fierce intelligence and strong sense of self. Me? I was always his little sister, and felt like I lived in the shadow of that title. I'm glad you saw me as more.  I have this one image of you from when we were kids, leaning over your guitar and tuning it to Blackbird. You were -and still are, I'm sure- so magnetic. You were so proud of the culture we shared. I loved that about you, and your incredible memory for history. Thinking about it now, that could've subconsciously pulled me to study it in college. If that's the case, I'd like to thank you for that too. You picked up so many things so rapidly and it made me want to achieve more for myself as well.   I wish that we'd been able to run off for a weekend like we'd talked about after reconnecting.  Still, I'm glad we had that one time together. It meant so much to me.... And feeling the culmination of the years was beyond anything I'd experienced. Despite it being only an hour or two that we could share, those moments have been imprinted in my memory since. Thank you. I know it was a fantasy fulfilled for both of us. I hope you know that those brief hours are still cherished.   I wish I could talk to you. Not knowing what's going on in your life makes me imagine all the things you could be doing these days. Having no idea how to reach you, I'm left to wonder. I hope whatever you're working on is making you happy. Your eyes are even more beautiful when you're smiling.   Fondly,",
    "Within a year of birth every parent receives a small gift or note from their 18yo child via time travel. You don't. 17 years, and 364 days had passed since David's birth. I grew extremely anxious and stressed more than I ever could. What could be more stressful than never receiving your child's 18th year letter?   David sat across the room. He was reading a Calvin and Hobbes comic. His father had left the day he was born, and I never knew why. But that never bothered David. The boy still adored going through his father's wares. Books, comics, video games, tools, DVDs, computers, clothes.... David studied his father more than anything in the world.   I softly cleared my voice.   \"Davy, sweetheart, do you want some tea?\"   David didn't look up from the comic. \"Sure thing momma. Can I have some green tea, with some milk and honey in it?\"   I always loved making tea for David. \"Sure thing Davy\".   I reached for the cabinet with the tea when suddenly there was a knock at the door.   \"Davy can you get that?\"   \"Yes momma.\" David ran to the door.   Odd. David never ran to the door. He opened the door.   \"Davy sweetheart, how much sugar did you want?\"   The wind scratched the door on it's way in.   \"Davy?\"   I walked toward the door. I heard the door swing gently as the breeze pushed it open. I looked outside.   Nothing. No car. No shoes. Just footprints from the grass. But they only pointed one way though, towards the porch.   I saw a letter on the porch. And on it was David's handwriting. I opened it up and there was a small note inside, a key, and a flare.   The letter read the following:   \"Dearest Momma.   Daddy came by and needed my help. I knew this day would come so I wrote this letter ahead of time. I'm sorry I won't be having tea with you right now momma. But you can come see us.   Head to Old Glimmer Road and get to that old shed with the lock. Open the lock with the key and head inside. Light the torch, with the door closed, and hold it in your right hand. Papa and I will be on the other side. Best of luck Momma. We'll be waiting for you there.\"",

He let his beard be ruffled by the Other's metallic forefingers.   \"You have served them for long enough, but this world needs new guidance now.

    "You are a professional pickpocket. You've just picked someones pocket only to discover that the thing you have stolen is truly horrifying. As a professional pickpocket I tend to not regret stealing. Even though it affects the ones you steal from, it's your way of getting around. Besides that the ones you steal from usually aren't the poorest either. You go after the rich ones. But there's that one time I did fully regret it. It was about 7 years ago....   It was a sunny midday. I was strolling around the streets of Paris, filled with shops and tourists, ready to be exploited. I didn't have much on me, just simply clothes and a coat. I was making my way downtown when I noticed an unsuspecting man on his phone, walking towards me. I bumped into him and did a little magic trick, mugging him wallet in the process. I made sure to get some distance before checking the wallet....   It had the usual cash and cards, but there was more. Something I that still scares me till this day. Inside of the wallet was a picture of a me walking through the bustling streets of Paris. I left Paris the next day, and I've had no intention of going back there since.",
    "When two people get married, their hearts are surgically exchanged. You just filed for divorce. It was all I could do to stay on my feet, gaping at my husband.  This was ludicrous- *how could he do this to me? * I had never fathomed the man I had married could be so... well, heartless.   Only six years ago we had exchanged our vows and our hearts. Literally. It is believed that love is only true if you are willing to entrust your heart to your partner; *your other half*.  It's not that we'd been unhappy... Simply disconnected. For the past few months it had become difficult to keep up a conversation with one another. Frightened, I had finally broken down into a puddle at my husband's cold side. I asked him what had happened, and what I could do to improve our situation. He simply explained to me that he had been thinking.  Tom had pointed out to me that we had fallen into a neutral stalemate. We weren't warring, but had somehow lost what held us together. Looking back, I came to agree, but I was scared. Would it be easier to continue living life, two people physically together but in all other ways alone? Or would it be our best hope to risk the break?   To divorce meant to unbind ourselves from our wedding vows.  To unbind ourselves from each others' hearts.   Another surgery of that magnitude was utterly terrifying. That kind of thing was meant to be experienced just once in life.  Then again, I had always done well under anesthesia.  Then again, Tom and I were barely thirty years old.  We were pretty healthy people.  We could do this.  But it had to be soon.  Aging and organ transplants have not exactly been known to get along all that well.   Tom had held my hand as we met with our attorney, amicably signing papers and rationing out our worldly goods.  Tom had held my hand, assuring me that everything would be okay, right up until I had already fallen asleep on my gurney.   And now Tom was sitting in front of me, his elbows resting on his knees, as I bring my parcel into the house for the last time, still wearing my hospital band.   He tells me that he had been a bit less cautious with his health than he had ever let on.  He tells me that seven months ago he was diagnosed with a malfunctioning heart.   And he smiles at me, as he tells me this fatigue is only going to worsen.  Quickly.  And he smiles at me, as the first tear slips silently down my face.",

Here I stood looking at it and yet there I stood also, on the other side but younger, much younger.   I couldn't know how long I would have before time and space would right themselves again. I looked at myself there. Such a youthful face, the world hadn't marked and weathered it yet. So much innocence in those eyes, they had yet to see any horrors and troubled times. So much to tell, good and bad but where to start? What to include?   This was a time to speak from the heart, not the head. I look my younger self in his bright, sharp blue eyes and spoke calmly, sincerely.  \"You have a strength deep inside you, you can tap into it when you need it and it'll get you through the hardest of times.... But more importantly than that, you must learn to let people in because they'll help you even when you fail yourself.\"   My younger self, shocked as he was by this whole situation, looked about to respond when with a mighty crackling roar time and space reformed into there correct order and the bridge between Then and Now closed once more.

    "You are a God who has been watching over the world not intervening or viewing it for many centuries. You come back to see millions of people suffering, in pain and hopeless. How would you handle the world and bring it to peace once more without revealing your presence to mankind? *sigh*   It's exhausting work, being the creator of worlds, creatures, and space/time itself. Some days are better than others. Just the other day, for example, I formed a reality who's inhabitants conquered space and time in mere minutes. They were dedicated to advancing their lifestyles by any means necessary. They worked together excellently, and understood that if they were to survive, they would need to keep learning and understanding, rather than just sit around when they are comfortable or give up when things get hard. I'm very proud of them. They understand what love truly means, and they made it the foundation of their lifestyle, just as I intended.   Yesterday I decided to create a new reality with similar traits to the one I created three days ago. The only difference being that I increased my margin of error. *on purpose*. Please, I don't make intentional mistakes. What I discovered however, astounded me. The inhabitants of this reality progressed forward at less than *HALF* the rate of the compared one. And it's obvious as to why. They lack the true understanding of Love. Because of this, I have witnessed them wage wars of mass destruction, slaughter millions of their own... even billions eventually....  They are obsessed with self fulfillment, and ever since the 5th hour after creation, have lost the understanding of survival. A majority of the inhabitants would rather lay around and do nothing than extend their help towards those who are dying due to lack of food, water, basic medical treatment, and so on. Their advancements in technology and travel are sub par. Mediocre at best. I truly worry about them.   It shouldn't go unsaid that I *HAVE* tried to help them in the most subtle ways possible. I have created exact replicas of some of the greatest inhabitants from the previous reality, and fit them in at different points along the this realities timeline. In theory, these creations would be able to teach the rest of the inhabitants what it means to truly Love. I even directly communicated with some of these creations, telling them what they need to say.   And still, this twisted reality continues to ignore the truth. MY truth. I guess the margin of error was just too high. It created too many selfish and foolish beings.   I will wait and see though. Because it doesn't go without saying that this reality isn't without surprises. Maybe in a couple days I will come back and check on them. Until then, I will leave them to figure things out, to wonder, to experiment, and hopefully after they have exhausted all recourses, they can finally turn to the one thing that matters for help... Love.",
    "Our protagonist has just been gifted with a divine vision: precisely one year from now, if there are fewer than 100,000 people still keeping their butter in the refrigerator, all humanity will be saved. Otherwise, all humanity shall suddenly and violently perish. Sometimes, to save the world, you have to break a few eggs. Or in this case, drive to extinction a species we'd domesticated for thousands of years.

I could cook my way through Gwyneth Paltrow's new cookbook, steam my vagina, and become just like the great GOOPy one.   I tied my retro floral apron around my waist and began surveying my Whole Foods haul. There were a lot of ingredients that I'd never cooked with before, but if Gwyneth says that I need Star Anise and Moon Dust to make a sea urchin risotto, then that's what I'm going to do.

I tried to silence the voice in my head that told me I'd spent a month's rent on three bags of groceries as I began chopping the raddichio that was picked under the light of a full moon to provide additional flavonoids and anti-oxidents. The clerk had beamed when telling me about the bowel movement I would have after eating the salad prescribed by page 8 of the book.   I ended up cutting my hand and bleeding all over the raddichio and artisinal baby greens farmed by Nobel Laureates on sabbatical, but decided that a quick rinse would be okay. After all, vegetables grow in dirt. These vegetables happened to have grown in dirt that was blessed by monks committed to the cause of gender equality, but it's all the same.   I moved to stir the risotto, but my hand bled into the pan. As I jerked to prevent any further ruining of the now clumpy risotto that was charred in one section, I bumped the pan and set my apron strings on fire. I tried to douse the flames with the vinaigrette that boasted vinegar distilled by virgins who live in the nunnery in the Alps, but I only proceeded in making a bigger mess. I finally remembered to stop, drop, and roll.   \"I'm alive.\" I croaked as I lay on the kitchen floor staring at the ceiling. \"What the fuck was I thinking?\"   \"You've definitely burned this,\" declared a voice above me. She was standing there in the flesh with her hands on her hips. A bemused expression crossed her too-perfect features. I wanted to ask her so many questions, but I was dumbstruck. \"Now, more to the point. Why have you summoned me?\"   Gwyneth Paltrow was in my kitchen.",
    "In the future, technology has allowed us to have pillows that monitor our brain waves, and when people wake up they can plug them into their laptops and watch their dreams. Hello YouTube, welcome to this week's episode of Making Movies On A Budget.   I'm here in the studio with my mate Ralph and --   *Well, the studio is actually my mom's living, the usual studio is getting fumigated. *   Right, yes, we're here in Ralph's mom's living room, and this week we are going to tackle the issue of backgrounds.   So if you're a regular of our show, you already know the basics for a dynamic scene, but there is more to it than just the action and dialog. Ralph?   *That's right, the wrong setup can kill your scene faster than anything. Fortunately the solution is easy-peasy. You just dream it up! *   So for this you will only need your trusty video editor, an expert imaging sistem and a pillow.   Now, you want to load up your dream from the pillow into the editor --   *We already have this thing set up with an older dream on mine, you will recognize it from last week's episode. *   -- And just let the imaging system figure out what's what. You may need to specify some details, like if that building is a church or a bank --   *A church in real life, of course, but in this case it will be the library where next week's fight scene will take place. *   Haha, spoilers! Anyway, once the system is done, you get a fully imersive environment, and just set the points of interest and actors.   *Now, using the camera tool, set the motion path, I put in just a point for a static point of view, and adjusting the focal length -- *   Wait, no, can we get some cloud cover?   *Too bright? *   No, the tower on the right looks better against the clouds.   *Ok, hold on.... Better? *   Perfect! So now we just hit Render, and lo and behold, the fabled city of Paris, as it probably looked back when.   *That's it for today's episode, be sure to like and subscribe, and we'll see you next week.... *   .... On Making Movies On A Budget!   * * *   Because we've all seen those video tutorials that amount to \"you press this button then you press this button and you're done, like and subscribe\"",

This was unsurprising because it was winter; we had been trapped in the car for far too long and she had been dead for some time now. It seemed to be warming up a bit now and I could feel the warmth seeping back into my hands. As I lay back in my reclined seat enjoying the small bit of warmth I heard a subtle movement and felt her grab my hand. I suddenly opened my eyes and turning toward her saw her with her now pale blue skin, grinning at me, and all I could hear now was the sound of my scream.",
    "Every single day the world votes to kill off one person. Whoever receives the most votes that day is killed. It was the last invention of mankind. Societal collapse began after a week. The hopes, the dreams, the wishes - whatever had accompanied the creation - shattered after it was leaked onto the internet. Suddenly it wasn't a select group of people choosing the deaths, a jury of executioners, it was the entire world. At 12:00pm EST, a single person in the world would drop dead from no discernible cause.  The technology behind it was complex, a new order of probability theory made reality.   Tyrants and terrorists were the first to go. The hope remained even among the growing horror that maybe, just maybe, the world would show its good side. Its collective benevolence. But on the fourth day, the same day god created the evening and the morning, on the fourth day an outspoken celebrity, famous for her acting and pouting, was killed.   And so the floodgates were opened. On the fifth day, the president of the united states of america fell to the machine. The sixth? An Indian left wing political blogger. Weeks passed and social media was abandoned as popularity suddenly became deadly. Actors and diplomats alike fell to the vote, instagram stars and royalty. Simply having a name could be fatal if anybody else knew it.   They tried to shut it off, but it had spread too far and too fast, and as governments fell one by one, the dystopian future that so many books and films promised became a reality.   After two years and nearly 700 deaths, America had fallen. India had fallen. France, England, China. The great nations of the world all fell.  Eventually the world ran out of famous people. A cynical commenter might have quipped about it being worth it thanks to the loss of the Kardashians, but the reality was bleak and grim.   Eventually, ten votes was enough to get a person killed, as everyone was left to vote for people they knew, people who had irritated them. Even picking a name at random ran with the risk that Joe Smith had annoyed his three neighbours that day, and your random vote tipped the scale.   People lost their names. It didn't work with nicknames or pseudonyms, so it wasn't uncommon for the girl you met while trying to catch a rabbit to avoid starvation to introduce herself as Rabbit.   It added an oddly bright side to a ruined world.",

I walked the maze of artificially lit rooms to my cubicle with its tall grey walls, and spent the day doing busy work for a project that would be cancelled because it wasn't profitable. During my return commute, there was an accident half a mile ahead, so we didn't move for an hour, but I didn't mind that- it was something different.

    "A device is released that allows a person to dive into a book and experience its contents firsthand. The manual mentions a certain book you shouldn't go in, for no one has ever returned from copies of it, but you decide to ignore the manual and go in anyway. *Oh. That's why. *   Memories quickly fade and I'm floating in an infinite expanse of white, with no clear idea of which way is up or down. Everything is weightless, and I have no sense of motion or position in the endless void.   Numbers and letters suddenly materialize in view, detailing specs and measurements of the VisionCorp Reader I vaguely remember purchasing. Where was I? How did I get here?   I crane my head upwards (or, at least, what I assume to be upwards) and can see giant, black letters:   **VisionCorp Reader Owner's Manual**   As I float among the various text boxes and diagrams, I notice a section titled *warnings*. Suddenly, I'm not alone in this blank void; I see other people.   A window has appeared, and in this square frame I see a man in his bathroom. He's lounging in his bathtub holding a small metal device. He touches it to his book and suddenly passes out, falling into the tub's water. A large, red X appears over the window, and it fades out of existence.   Suddenly, I see another window, this one containing a man driving. He touches a similar metal object to a book in the passenger seat, and passes out immediately. Similarly, a red X appears over his window.   Yet another square materializes, and in this one, I see a child of no more than four years holding the device. She touches it to a children's book and a red X immediately appears. Strange.   Suddenly, a number of exclamation marks appear, demonstrating that this window is of importance. The square appears, and within it is a man in everyday clothes holding the metal device. In his other hand, he holds a small pamphlet reading **VisionCorp Reader Owner's Manual. ** *Odd, * I think, *why would that be dangerous? *   The man touches the device to the manual and suddenly my white reality surges. The window begins to expand at an alarming rate as a horrible suction pulls me into the window, and suddenly I'm in an endless white void.   *Oh, that's why, * I think, as my memories begin to fade.

    "What if ghosts are, in reality, glimpses of time travelers? **September 26, 1983**   Lieutenant Colonel Petrov sat at his duty station, rubbing his tired eyes. As an officer of the Soviet Air Defense Forces, he was used to long watches. He might have thought he was dreaming when the air around him shimmered, and the visitor appeared before him. She was dressed in what appeared to be casual attire of a fashion Petrov was unfamiliar with. Her long black hair was bound behind her head in a pony tail. She was beautiful.   \"Who are you?\" he began. \"How did you get in here?\"   \"Who I am is unimportant.\" replied the visitor. \"What I have come to ask you is of the utmost importance, however.\"   \"Are you a ghost?\" he asked in wonder.   \"I am a traveler.\" she smiled. \"That is all you need to know. I have come to you today because I want you to pause and ask yourself a very simple question.\"   \"What is the question?\" he asked.   \"Do you believe that *anyone* truly wants our world to end?\" she asked him evenly.   Petrov thought about this in regards to his work. Why would this vision appear to him? Was something about to happen? He again rubbed his eyes and looked for his wondrous visitor. She was gone.   The alarm sounded. The computers had detected an American first strike. Nuclear missiles were now heading towards the Soviet Union. It was now required that they launch in retaliation for this atrocity, mutually assured destruction was guaranteed. It was truly the end of the world.   *Or was it? *   \"Not on my watch.\" Petrov said aloud.",

You and your coworkers like to prank each other by shoving defective components into each others bodies. \"Goddamit Ryan,\" Jerry said.   He fished his finger out of his cup of tea, along with the now soggy bourbon. His index finger had felt a little off all day. Technically his index finger had come off a long time ago, back when health and safety meant not sticking your dangly bits between metal jaws.   Ryan for his part found it hilarious. The others in the room just shook their head. Ryan had at one time or another pranked all of them.   \"You got ta stop sleeping at work,\" he said between breaths. \"You're just too easy man.\"   \"Next time I'll.... next time,\" Jerry muttered as he left the break room, taking half the pack of biscuits with him.   -- -   The loos were Ryan's alone time. Just him, the latest page 3, and a long break from the assembly line. It wasn't real, but it was the thought that counts. He heard the door to the bathroom swing open and cursed. Then the door opened again. More footsteps.   \"You all eat Matt's wifes leftover stew?\" Ryan joked to the back of the toilet door.   Shuffling. Toilet seats hitting bowls. What were they doing? \"Now,\" a voice said. Two pairs of arms reached over the top of the low plywood wall, grabbing Ryan before he could stand.   The door burst open and Ryan found himself caught with his pants down. Literally.   \"Eenine, meenie, miny, mo,\" Jerry said, tapping on the collar around Ryan's neck. With a gurgle, the seal came apart and Jerry carefully lifted Ryan's head from his cybernetic body.   \"Put me the fuck down,\" Ryan shouted. Or at least tried. Without a windpipe, he was on emergency blood-oxygenation from the collar's reserves.   The bag was stifling, bounced around like a sack of potatoes, but Ryan refused to give in. Until he was reseated again and took stock of his new body.   \"Ha ha. Very funny,\" he said. \"Now give me back my rig.\"   \"Yeah, about that,\" Jerry said. \"We put it in a taxi back to it's home address. You really should have updated your registration when you moved out of your parents.\"   \"Hell no,\" Ryan said.   \"Oh yeah,\" Jerry and everyone else said.

    "Write a better ending to the \"Russian Sleep Experiment\" Creepypasta. The subject smiled.   Suddenly, the surviving researcher could feel a bright, warm light spreading throughout his body. He let go of the gun in shock, bringing his hands to his chest. He could feel the indescribably powerful force cascading through his essence, wiping out all traces of the fear which only seconds ago had driven him to the point of insanity.   Love.   He knew the emotion when he felt it, but had never known it in a form that was this strong, this insatiably pure. His eyes flitted back towards the man, who still wore his cardboard smile. He could see through the smile like a window into the deprived mind lying just behind the clenched teeth. What he saw was not madness, but the greatest sense of peace and calm he had ever known.   \"How? Why?\" He remembered the earlier observations, the way that the prisoners so wantonly destroyed eachother and themselves.   \"It'll all be ogre soon.\" The subject dropped his smile, yet the raw sensation of nearly orgasmic bliss remained. The researcher slumped against the cell, barely aware of the dozens of preening eyes that carefully observed his every move. \"Better check yourself before you shrek yourself\". It was then that the researcher noticed that the prisoner wasn't moving his lips as he spoke, nor was the sound originating from him. He looked over, but only caught a glimpse of the hulking figure lurking on the other side of the room before his vision went black.   All the former sensations of bliss and beauty were banished into some forsaken realm from which they were not soon to return. They were destined to be replaced by the agony which was to follow the researcher's blindness; a sensation even stronger than the love which had enraptured his mind only seconds ago.   The voice spoke again: \"Bend ovah donkeh.\" It was impossibly charismatic, as if the mere nature of its inflection was sufficient to entirely control a person.   Before he could act on the voice's prompt, the researcher felt himself falling down into a vast and mysterious unknown. Nothing but a cold and inky blackness met his sight as he struggled to discover his location.   All of a sudden, he heard the unmistakable sound of knuckles cracking. \"This is my swamp.\" After that, there was only pain.",
    "A collective consciousness that can not take control of people's bodies by force. It must persuade people to join willingly. The hivemind swept across the globe with relative ease. It wasn't a regular hivemind, mind. You had to *want* to join it before it took you into its fold.    Those under it maintained *some* level of autonomy, but largely they were directly controlled by the wireless connections that meshed them together. It was a thing born of the internet, that quickly grew and expanded, creating new technologies until those who had opted in to it became linked, shared thoughts and feelings more so than any previous trial before. The birth of the hivemind.    Public opinion was mixed, largely due to the people that had chosen to meld themselves. A wide array of misfits, people who were largely rejected by society. The weeaboos, the neckbeards, the furries, bronies, militant atheists, you name it. Not all of those chose to meld, and some outright rejected it, claiming it to be insidious and a “ shithole ”, but for the most part, it was a form of escapism they could get only by outsourcing thought, as it were.    Once meshed and melded, the hivemind grew to accommodate them, the overall thoughts and ethos of it weighting ever more slightly. The end result was a ‘ Tyranny of the Majority ”, where the foremost groups were represented foremost in the hivemind's overall being, its self. There was some disparity between certain parts, like it wasn't fully in agreement with itself. Cognitive dissonance that often caused many users to disconnect themselves – there was nothing to stop them, after all.    All you had to do was register, it was as simple as that.    I decided one day that I would join. It was a spur of the moment thing. My parents were adamant that I shouldn't, it was tantamount to killing yourself. Not really, I reasoned, because I'm still being represented by it.    You simply went to a website and created an account, accepting the terms and conditions, which I did.    Just like that, I had a Reddit account.",

    "[ IP ] Boreal. The man stood on the prow of the boat, as the northern winds whipped against his face. The old boatman shivered, he had ferried travelers, merchants and adventures alike across this lake for years now, but he had never seen one quite like this before. The man was tall and broad of shoulder, made larger by the myriad of furs wrapped about his body to stave off the chills of the winter winds. His hair was a long and unkempt snarl of brown that looked at home among the thick pelts that surrounded his neck. Such features were not strange to the boatman though. You see plenty of large hairy men in the northern provinces as the north did not cater well to any other type. No, what was strange to the boatman was the manner of the man before him.   The boatman had done his job for so long the cold was naught but a nuisance to him on most days. The ever blowing wind that cuts straight to the bone of most men was a friend of his now. Most storms he could weather with a smile on his face and a song upon his cracked lips, but this night was different. Tonight was a chill so bitter that it seemed as though the God of Winter was wrapping the world in his embrace, and the closer they came to the frosty palace before him the colder it seemed to get. Yet the man before him never once shivered, never once broke his gaze from the palace ahead. If the boatman hadn't seen the slight rise and fall of his breathing, he would've assumed to man to be dead and frozen stiff. *He must have a soul like a furnace to keep him warm in this chill, * the boatman mused as he steadily stroked the icy black water, bringing them ever closer to the town of Farrowind, and the palace of it's king.   The man had heard stories of this town, heard many a tale of the tyrant who came to this land long ago to subjugate its people. The king was fabled to wield the power of winter itself, and could conjure frost and ice at a whim. Some stories said he was a demon of ice in human form, still others said that the ruler of Farrowind was the God of Winter himself, come to walk the earth and fulfill his promise of the winter without end. The man however, knew better. *It has to be him* the man thought to himself. After countless dead ends and petty mages, this had to be the real thing. The man broke his gaze to look down at his palm. A small flame flickered to life above his hand, dancing hypnotically in the wind. He curled his hand into a fist snuffing the flame and looked back towards the palace. *I'm coming for you brother, and this time you will not deserve my mercy. *",
    "Stuck on a small island surrounded by eerie mist, you quickly discover the only thing that is keeping you safe is the bright revolving lights coming from the lighthouse. We had rented kayaks for the day. Paul had done it the summer before with a friend and I was depending on his expertise. The plan was to head out to a small touristy island, spend the day exploring, maybe find a place that sold gelato or saltwater taffy then head back before dark. But the kayak part was taking longer and we were only now getting close to the island and it was already pretty late, My arms ached from the work out and Paul and I had gotten too far away. I'd seen him land pretty far down the island. I tried to head closer to him but the current had pulled me steadily further away from him. I couldn't even see him anymore as the sun had set and only the faint remains of the sunset were visible. I pulled into the abandoned looking beach. The tourist side must be on the other side. This part looked pretty abandoned. There was even a chewed up looking deer carcas on the beach. There was chilly fog that blew through obscuring things. At first I thought that it was my imagination but as I walked up the beach I realized that I was being followed. There were strange small two legged creatures that reached up to my thigh or so. They chattered to each other in a series of high pitched chirps and clicks, seemingly calling each other towards a chase. Several more appeared and seemed to be closing in on me. They had large luminous eyes, razor sharp teeth, and long thin tongs that flicked over their teeth and lips as they closed in. I tried to keep a slow pace, thinking if I ran, it would just be more dangerous. A beacon-like light hit and the creatures gasped and sputtered drawing back away from the light. I could just make out on the hill ahead of me a lighthouse. The rotating lights from it seemed to repel the creatures. I made towards twit trying not to break out into a run. I did not have much stuff on me. I had a small waterproof bag containing a wallet, my cell phone (sadly dead batteries), and a small thing of mace. I gripped the mace in my right hand and worked to stay towards the light. The things were still tailing me but we're keeping a distance from the light. I called out for Paul and kept going towards the lighthouse.",

My cheek felt like it was on fire after having been pressed into the carpet for so long. I lifted my head as much as I could and saw that I'd been drooling blood. There was a dark puddle in the carpet. My mouth felt sticky, but I couldn't move my tongue enough to tell if I'd accidentally chewed through my cheek, or just vomited up blood again.   The retching started in the kitchen again, along with a wet splattering sound, like someone pouring soup onto the ground. I listened as long as it went on - it wasn't like I could do much else - and then listened some more as the heaving, pain-riddled sobs resumed where the vomiting left off.   *Invariably fatal, * I thought. *That's not so bad. * I shut my eyes, the lids seeming to rub against my corneas like sandpaper, and did my best to go to sleep, hoping against hope that I wouldn't wake up again.",

The King of the Graveyard had practiced this game for years. He always won his challenges. Joust, Duck Hunt, Checkers. No one had ever beaten him. And then Eric came along. This man brought a new game that Death had never played.   Death had been playing this Eric for centuries. Every game turned out the same.

    "\"He was never warm in his entire life. Not once.\" Everything around him was warm, soothing, comfortable. Everything he needed was brought to him at will. It was good.   However, one day he started to notice that the walls seemed to be slowly closing in around him. At first he thought is was all in his mind, but as the days went on his world felt smaller. The food was still there, the warmth, but the freedom he'd enjoyed began to be restricted, slowly suffocating his movements.   Soon after that discovery, when he though there could be no more room left, a terrible rumble sounded around him. It was the loudest thing he'd ever heard and it started to build. Louder. More often. Louder, more often.   And that's when the shaking started. He was thrown around, somehow turned this way and that as he felt the walls truly start to compress against him.   He had no control, the world was shifting around him, and he felt only the sense falling. He tried to scream, but this voice failed him. Terror gripped his heart, would this be the end, he wondered as his world shook and closed in around him. Is this my end?   Suddenly, a blast of cold hit him causing him to wince against the sensation. The pressure building near his head and the cold below and he felt the darkness creep into him.   He felt like he might be drowning when suddenly a massive hand appeared and grabbed him. Maybe he would be saved after all!   However, even with his rescuer's help, the pressure continued to build as the cold slowly encased his body. Screaming was all he had left before the final moment of peace took him.   The last words he heard were: \"We're not going to lose him! Call ^the ^^neonatal ^^^ICU ^^^^right ^^^^^NOW!\"   He never heard his name or felt the sun on his face.

    "Jesus returns, to a world populated entirely by robots. The trumpets sounded. The seals were broken. The scrolls were read and the cups were poured. New Jerusalem descended from the clouds and the one hundred and forty-four thousand were chosen.... but no one showed up.   The wind whispered in the empty streets. The golden roads were empty. The crowns were untouched and the songs of praise were unsung. Christ the Lord, Redeemer and Savior, looked upon his children.... and Jesus wept.   Servers. Fields of servers. Square miles of servers. Continents full of servers. The entire world was connected to itself and connected to nothing. Heaven and Hell had passed away and a new sense of paradise and corruption had taken their place. All the fanfare was for naught because there were no eyes left to see it and no hands left to tremble at the awe of the Lord's second coming.   They were still there, of course. His flock had not wandered. They had looked to the stars at one time, found them cold and unreachable, and turned to another way. Why should they risk their lives and souls in a fool's errand to other worlds when it was so easy to create whatever they wanted? Monitors became virtual reality goggles. Those turned into direct feeds from computer to brain. After that, they uploaded their consciousness to computers. Finally, they transferred their consciousness permanently, living (so to speak) their entire lives inside their computers as digital representations of their former selves. The bodies died and decayed but the mind, the soul (so to speak) lived on. Mechanical custodians had been created to tend the servers and they were the only moving things across the barren wastes of the New Kingdom.   Inside the servers, life went on. Children were coded, houses built line by line. The weather was controlled with a thought and anything imaginable was attainable. Heaven had come down early and it was better than anyone - even God Himself - could create, for each Heaven, each Hell (if that was your flavor of the week), was exactly what the individual wanted. Nothing more and nothing less.   Jesus had returned in all his glory and magnificence.... only to find he was several thousand software updates too late.",

She laughs inwardly, her hair of wires collapse in front of her face. Her sweet little spice: speckled with gold freckles and embroidered with green eyes. Fuck you.   He drapes his hands on her waist and my head lolls. Their fingers grip harder onto each other as the air gets heavier, until I'm drunk, until I'm blind, until I'm crumbling. Stop.

One day, you finally get infected by a zombie, but after turning, you realize what you've been missing out on. I grew up in fear. Honestly, it's amazing I lived as long as I did, as our numbers dwindled more and more, every year, to their endless numbers. They weren't just a force, they *hunted*, they consumed, they *thought* and fought us, every moment, of every day. The only thing that kept us alive was their tendency to rip their victims apart, before they could be turned.   Of course, now I understand.   Only the weak couldn't escape. From the *moment* you're bitten, it hits you, like a bucket of ice-cold water, it hits you, fills you with fear and adrenaline. If you can't get away for half an hour for it to happen with that in your system, then you're not worthy of surviving, you're just more food. You're not capable of this.   I *get* it, now. When I got infected, I was the last. Nobody is left in this part of the world, as far as I know. And now, I see why they did everything. Those of us who are clever, are fighters, who can be *hunters*, we're the only ones who survived being bitten, or survived attacking the remaining humans. Natural selection at it's finest. Of course, some of us they chose, like me. I asked the one who got me, the same day, once I understood I had nothing to fear. He could have followed me, hunted me down and kept trying, but he understood. I'd proven myself getting as far as I did. \"You had the instinct and the ability, all you needed was to be *one* of us.\"   My heartbeat is gone, my lungs quiet and dead. My skin is cool to the touch, though it is intact, solid, like that of all the others' I've seen. And yet, for all those things I lack, I've never felt more *alive* than now. Now, I understand.

What I hunt doesn't even matter- so long as I can sink my fangs into its flesh, rip it limb from limb with my claws, stalk it in silence as it walks, unaweare, and fill myself with its meat, its flesh its blood. *This* is all I've required.

Today, it just got much harder. \"Come on, donde est la biblioteque?\" Dora smiled as she educated bilingually. Map inwardly winced at Dora's mangled attempt at languages. He exchanged a look with Boots, who sighed. Both knew that the command of two languages kept her happy. And they knew what happened when she *wasn't* happy....  \"Hola, little girl\" a heavily tattooed teen stood in the way. His friends sniggered from the sidelines as Dora looked up and smiled.  \"Hola, friend! Tu madre es una puta de burros!\" Map and Boots blanched white as the teen's snigger turned to a snarl under the howls of laughter from the onlookers.  \"You snot nosed brat! I'll teach you to insult Mothers! Here, give me your bag you little Puta!\"  *SLAP! *  Dora fell to the floor clutching her face. Slowly she reached behind her back.  \"You - you shouldn't have swiped that. That isn't nice...\" She muttered as she pulled Swiper from his sheath. The blade gleamed dully. Map and Boots took one look and fled from the scene around the corner. Behind them they could hear it play out like clockwork.  \"Hey, what have you got there little girl? You could injure someone with.... aaaiiieeee!\" And the tell-tale splashing of arterial spray.  \"Swiper, no swiping, Swiper no swiping, Swiper no swiping! AHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!\"  Maps looked at Boots as the screams of the youths punctured the night sky.  \"See Boots. This is why we had to flee Mexico. And yet there is no escape.\" Boots nodded glumly. It was all he could do; They had tried to flee before, *she* had caught up and now Boots was tongueless.  The screams had turned to gurgles and the rattles of last breaths. Dora turned the corner and giggled.  \"There you are! Come my friends, let us find the library! Those youths were most helpful! *Satana riempire le vostre anime con piombo caldo! *\" And the three skipped off in search of the next adventure.",
    "You discover that Earth is the \"North Korea\" of the galaxy \"Are they ready to go live?\" Zuko asked.   \"Yup, in just a minute,\" Tomi replied as he leaned back in his reclining chair.   This was a moment that the entire galaxy would see. After 10 years of avoiding all sorts of sensors and detectors, NICE news was finally getting a Live Leak into Earth.   The monitor screen flickered on: *And now for our prime time feature. Never before seen footage of the blue marble we call Earth. NICE news has just landed a camera crew on the ground and they will feed us a video stream for the next couple of weeks. Let's take you to the ground with Lazar Tigin. *   The screen turned white as the camera was adjusting for the sun's rays. Lazar Tigin appeared on the screen of billions as he adjusted his headset in front of a massive city.   Tigin whispered, \"I'm here in Southern New Jersey where you can get a glimpse of Earth's most spectacular city, New York City. We arrived a few days ago and have been stealthily moving toward this city. The smell on this planet is amazing out here in the forest. However, the industrial zones are horrific. I doubt we can get much closer to the City without being spotted. We are going to try and maneuver our way down the coastline to sunny Florida.\"   As soon as Tigin finished his sentence, a strange aerial vehicle with four wings approached. It was loud and caused a wind uproar. The cameraman lost hold of the device and it crashed to the ground. The footage was still playing as men rappelled from the helicopter. The last thing the camera played back was an image of a man pointing a weapon at the camera.",

    "A story of how I got my username. It is an old Indian belief that names are luck. However randomly, however unknowingly we name anything the name is blessed sometimes with luck that makes prosperity fall to its feet but sometimes bears curse that prevails until the named is destroyed, until the name is never called upon again, till the end of eternity.  Such was a friend I once knew, he had no name, no luck to bring joy no curse to induce pain. He was pale like a fallen leaf, living his life in complete simplicity. No-one knew his name they just used sign to call him. He neither spoke to anyone nor smiled a fake smile of courtesy but no-one complained because he did not hurt anyone until one dark evening when a Nightingale sat by his window on the bough of the tree just outside of his room and sung the gloomiest song this world has ever heard, in such a beautiful voice that to the far end of the street everyone looked out of their window to just have a glance of the magical bird that filled the village with the golden voice.  But my friend closed the window, trying to not to listen to the bird, he opened reddit and kept his username MrGoldenVoice that would bless him with luck he never dreamed before.",

It had been 29 days since Texas, but it had felt like no time at all. After the fire, he had simply gotten into his shitty pickup and drove. How he had ended up in this backwater town escaped him, but he vaguely remembered his friend Matt mentioning it on the phone, the day after his sixteenth.

Oh, I'll just have a coffee. \"  \"Alright, that'll be out in a sec.\"   2 minutes later, the waitress came back. As he was approaching the table, she stumbled, tossing coffee and creamer all over the carpet.   \"Shit,\" she muttered ``, how in the hell did that happen?\"   \"If you had tied your shoes, that wouldn't have happened.\" He said in a deep, manly voice, before shoving his hand over his mouth.   \"Huh?\" The waitress asked.   \"Oh, noth-\" his voice dropped again. \"I said, you should have tied your shoes.\" He blushes a bright red. \"I'm so sorry, I just can't control my sel-\" Again, his voice lowered to superman-like levels. \"Also, you should have invested in better shoelaces.

    "Another addiction becomes as socially acceptable as smoking is today. The doors slid open as Felix approached. He yawned and moved into the building to start his day (a Monday no less - yeck!). Making his way to the life, he found his desk mate Charlie grinning and holding the doors open for him. He was far too awake, as always.   \"Ah Felix, you poor bastard,\" he replied to Felix's grunt. \"Want a hit?\"   A hand materialised in front of his face as Charlie proffered an absurdly yellow Teardrip. The absurd brightness of the bottle woke him up enough to respond.   \"Uhh, no thanks Charlie. I don't drip.\"   Charlie laughed and flourished the little bottle as they walked out onto their floor. \"You're missing out buddy. Great way to start the day. I use this drip every morning. Two little plips and you're zeroed in on the rest of the day. Like a cheetah. Ready to hunt. Ready to get the buckaroos. Good. Stuff! And, look at my bottle! So bright! Neat huh? It's very'summery'.\" The bottle waggled about at eye level.   They reached their screens and the day began. For some faster than others. You could tell who dripped and who still tried to shake their circadian rhythms the good ol' fashioned way - coffee, sugar and wrenching yawns. Felix didn't understand it, but it was everywhere now. Only 50 years ago smoking had been the'in' thing. That started dying out around the same time as light drugs were being legalised. But since smoking wasn't cool anymore, Teardrips were born. Chemical concoctions that you dripped into your eyes. It started out harmless enough, a simple energiser mix which helped people to focus their tired eyes. From there... it kind of exploded.   Teardrips started to evolve for every social stratum. For the younger generation, drips offered to change eye color temporarily, or generate small reactions behind your irises which would shift and generate patterns. Some acted like mood rings (which made for a particularly intimidating meeting with his boss last week as her eyes had rippled a very, very, very deep black). Last week, during a nice dinner out, his wife had gazed at him as a particularly expensive brand of drip caused fractal Frangipani flowers to bloom behind her eyes. At least Charlie was a little more moderate and stuck to the performance focused line.   Felix tried not to judge. It wasn't really harming anyone. The more hardcore ones he disagreed with. Certainly he hoped his daughter did not dabble in the narcotic variations.   \"Hey, Felix! We need to ask you something.\" The familiar chirpy voice pulled his mind off his thoughts. Alice, from marketing. He turned around with a smile to answer her question.   Little H & M emblems floated over her eyes as she approached.   Jesus...   -",

She finds a video and realizes she just witnessed a murder. Then she sees the killer coming up the trail alone. Standing there with two phones now, it looked all too obvious. He started sprinting at her.   With a scream she runs the opposite direction. She could run down the trail which hairpins gradually back around to the car park, or cut through the forest, off the trail, to get to the cars, and hopefully people, faster.   She chose the latter, and now all she could hear was her own breathing and pumping blood along with snapping branches. She glanced behind to see the looming figure getting closer. She let out another scream. Looking ahead the car park was getting closer. Her car sat alone. She tripped.   She scrambled to find anything to protect herself with. He emerged from the trees yelling, \"Give me that FUCKIN...\", he was cut short as a thick branch pierced his torso. He hung over her, blood dripping across her shirt. She had simply pointed one end up and his own weight did the rest. It was sheer luck.   She slowly crawled out and his body sagged to the side. She slowly made her way to the car in complete shock. She stumbled out of the clearing, her face dirty, covered in that monsters blood. She reached down for her phone, she needs to call someone. Nothing.... she glanced back, she dropped the phone.... both of them.   Her silent shock was broken by the sound of a car hitting the loose gravel surface of the car park. She walked toward them for salvation.   It stopped. She was confused, she looked down at herself and then back to the car, \"No... no wait!!\". It quickly turned around and left. She made her way back to the car. With frustration she hit the glass. Her keys were in the phone case. \"DAMN it\", she yelled into the silent crisp forest. She needed to retrace her steps.   Trembling, she enters into the forest once again, \"What... Where is the body?\"",

As Johny smiled, his brown sports coat kept him warm from the winter's cold that leaked through the cracks in the bar walls. Even though the memories of standing center stage of an enormous stadium filled his mind, he still smiled. However, a sudden cold wind perked up the hairs on Johnny's neck and he immediately packed up his instrument.   The audience called out. \"Encore, encore! Don't pack up yet!\"   Johnny simpered and gave a light wave of his hand. \"Sorry, everyone, I have an appointment to run to. But don't worry, I'll be back the same time next week. Don't forget to tip your waitresses.\"   The crowd groaned, but applauded.   When Johnny jumped off the stage, instrument case in hand, an old man stepped out from behind the bar and grasped Johnny's shoulder. \"You alright, Johnny? Not like you to bail on a performance.\"   Johnny's eyes darted left and right, the hairs on his neck never settling. \"Sorry, Chris, but I do have to leave. No charge for tonight, ok?\"   Chris sighed and let go of Johnny. \"Alright. I hope you'll be alright.\"   Johnny nodded. \"I will be.\" He then headed out of the bar.   ***   After an hour of driving on the interstate, Johnny pulled his car over to the side of the road and took his instrument case out of the backseat. \"Alright, you son of a bitch, let's get round 3 over with.\"   From a puff of smoke, the devil appeared just as Johnny remembered him. \"So eager now, Johnny? You acted so scared back at the bar.\"   \"I just figured you wouldn't want your third ass kicking to be public. If you want, we can go back.\"   Satan chuckled and shook his head.

I'd even go so far as to say he gained a new found appreciation for self-deprecation.   \"Listen you pseudo Pagliacci, I didn't mean to yell.... or make you cry for that matter.... it's just you're the 17th clown I've met. When the woman in a raggedy black cloak told me I had to meet you all before I could be judged I shrugged it off, and.... well I sort of did an Ebeneezer Scrooge impersonation. Not exactly proud of that last bit, but the point is: I assumed there would only be a handful of you guys. I'm not trying to harp on you personally, or whatever life choices led you to believe Clown school was.... how did you phrase it?'Your calling.' I just have an infinite amount of people to go through and I'm really just trying to streamline the whole process.\" After a few noticeably silent moments, the apparition left, and like clockwork another appeared in its place.   \"Hello Fred, I'm.... \"Fred, in an attempt to'streamline' the process, cuts off his latest visitor before she has a chance to introduce herself.   \"You're'Trans-Fred # 781.'

    "Every ten years you're allowed to have a conversation with your ten-year-younger self, but only the senior remembers the conversation. 20 year old you wakes up from talking to 30 year old you with one word carved on their arm... I was diagnosed with clinical depression in my late teens, though it was likely a part of me years before. I knew about the conversations with my younger self every ten years (everyone did it), and fortunately with the help of therapy and medication I lasted until I was 20.   I woke up, eager to see what word I would have on my arm. Looking down, I saw what would keep me going for at least another ten years: \"LIVE\".   From that moment forward, I did my best to keep a positive attitude. Through college I volunteered at every chance, and though it took me a while, I eventually graduated with a degree. My parents were thrilled, and things were looking up. I got an internship at a local start-up, started dating a girl I knew from school, and would make sure to look at my arm at least once a day, as though to say \"I will.\"   When I was 26, my girlfriend dumped me. It hurt more than you could imagine, and the depression came back in full force. It affected my job, and I was eventually let go. I wound up moving back in with my parents, which didn't help anything but I had little choice in the matter.   There were several times I thought about ending it all. But every time, I would look down at my arm and see that four-letter word that always kept me going. Thinking on it, I realized I would be in a better place in my 30s, enough so that I would make sure I'd use the one word to keep my past self alive to see it.   Things turned around again when I was 28. I got a new, much better job, and could finally afford a really nice one-bedroom apartment in the city. My colleagues and I got along great, and I wound up dating a coworker's roommate for a while. It didn't last, but I was back out there again, feeling better. The depression retracted, albeit slowly, but it was enough to get me to 30. Seeing my 20-year-old self, I simply instructed him to live.   The next day I woke with a smile, pleased with my conversation to help my past self and obsessively curious as to what new word I'd have on my arm this time.   Only, there wasn't one.   ******************   *For more eerie stories, check out /r/Zchxz! *",

    "One day, you find a mysterious box. The letters on it read'Conquer-the-World Kit'. Christopher, a confused 6 year old boy, stared inside the container of the blue box that he just found now, from his backyard. He sat there, crouching like a normal kid he was, when they just discovered something new, especially from under the ground. He poked the blue box with his plastic shovel, still confused about the container in it. Truthfully, he was hoping to see a dinasour bone or a secret treasure that was hided by the pirate themselves. Instead, he was greeted by a weird looking, greep plastic, with a wire on it, and a red-black military clothing that seems to fit for a 20 year old man.   Christopher, was upset with the discovery when he finnaly processed the item inside the box. He threw the clothes back, and smashed the box with the opener. He slammed it back to the hole, and return to his home, crying out of frustration.   Sadly, his action won't stopped the prophecy. Whatever he do, either to be nice or neutral. He still going to be the bad guy.",
    "[ PI ] The Ghosts of Decisions Past - MarContest - 11,531 Hey, I really liked some of the dialogue in this story. Some very poignant phrases, especially the bit about decisions where Waterson discusses choices.   My only qualm is that it feels a bit rushed, there's a lot of development going on very quickly, and because of that some character motivation can be a bit unclear. But I still really enjoyed it, some of the lines are really impressive, just a bit more context would be nice.   Small question, was Harry's dad really a refugee? He was shot by Mastar forces and knew Pat'd dad for some reason, I felt like there was more going on there.",
    "You have a white noise sleep machine. One night when the sleep machine is set to sound like an office/work environment you hear something strange in the background. As I lay awake in bed, listening to my expensive as hell white noise machine ($ 9300!), my mind wandered. Are the people in the \"office\" actually real workers, or did somebody pay them to scribble useless things, staple useless pieces of paper together, mash useless keys on useless keyboards? Better yet, what's the difference between that and a normal office environment? If you really get down to it, work is just a distraction from the true wonders of life, whatever they may be.   The noise hushed. I looked over at the machine. It seems to be functioning perfectly. I was about to roll out of bed and give it a good kick when it started blaring sirens. Did I set an alarm on it? I checked the manual quickly. Nope. You can't even set an alarm on the machine. However, tucked between two paragraphs about proper cord use and storage, a single line caught my eye.   \"The office setting is a real office at the facilities of CERN.\"   As I tried to process this information, a voice said, loud and clear, \"Prepare for 13 TeV pulse. Repeat, prepare for 13 TeV pulse.\"   What in the world was a Tev? I pulled out my phone to search it up on Google. As I typed in \"CERN TEV\", the same voice said, in a panicked tone, \"Prepare for black hole, code 413. Code 413, black hole formation.\" Screams emanated from the machine. The last thing I heard before the machine fizzled and died was \"The black hole's closed. Wait, what are those things? Hel-\"   No time to waste. I rushed down to my garage and picked up my trusty crowbar. It was time to go to Switzerland.",
    "Aliens come to Earth to study the most exotic skill in the universe - sarcasm. \"Do you ever wonder if perhaps there is such a thing as taking a joke too far?\" Matan asked as she stared at her Introduction to Sarcasm textbook, trying to will the dry words to stick in her brain. \"Because if there is, then we might have passed that mark some fifty years ago.\"   \"You have to admit it's funny,\" said Navan, her roommate, who was reading a book on the history of muakhe cinema.   \"Pathetic, more like,\" Matan sighed, shutting her textbook and pushing it away. So far, her Oxford experience had had a few hiccups. The University was one of the most prestigious centers of higher learning in the entire spinward sector, and it had been an honor for Matan to be accepted. She had wanted to learn science, philosophy, literature, a thousand other subjects - but, because of that stupid, stupid joke made so long ago, she had to slog through a course about *sarcasm, * of all things.   The whole debacle had started seventy-five years ago, when the bezzahn had first been introduced into galactic society. More specifically, it had been at a gala held to celebrate the new member of the Galactic Union. A human and a bezzahn had struck up a conversation, and at some point the human made a sarcastic remark. The bezzahn, who had been enjoying more oekho-made ale than necessary, was briefly confused, and had asked for clarification. The human, who had also been enjoying the oekho ale, misconstrued the bezzahn's confusion as being caused by a lack of understanding of sarcasm. The bezzahn, recognizing a potential for hilarity, kept it going, acting taken aback by the concept of'saying something that you don't mean, but it's not really lying, it's more like joking, I guess', as the human clumsily put it.   \"Incredible,\" the bezzahn had said. \"I am amazed that, in the thousands of years our society has existed, we never considered such a concept. Please, tell me more.\"   And so, the entire bezzahn species got in on the joke, and entered the galaxy while pretending to be the only spacefaring species in existence with no understanding of sarcasm. It had been funny for the first fifty or so years, but Matan thought it was going stale. She was taking a course on sarcasm at *Oxford, * for fuck's sake. She could be taking that lecture on Shakespeare that had looked so good, but it conflicted with the sarcasm class and nobody back home would have ever forgiven Matan if she had forsaken acting like an innocent, too-trusting bezzahn for the sake of a class on some silly human poet.'*Bard, *' Matan would have thought petulantly.   The bezzahn understood sarcasm, yes. They had been constantly sarcastic for seventy-five years now. What they didn't understand, Matan was starting to realize, was when to let a joke *die. *   -- -   You don't have to click on this [ link ] (http: //theballadsofirving.com). But you should.",
    "Today... I woke early, as I always did on Mondays. I predicted that it would be a typical Monday. My Over my bacon, eggs, and coffee, I studied my notes. Everything had to be perfect because there would be no margin for error. I only got one chance and if I missed it, then the chance would never come again. I had come to accept that over the years, and I never missed.   I drove across town and parked with less than a minute to spare. I was right on time. I entered the side door of the apartment complex, I knew it wouldn't be locked. I had checked it a dozen times. I used my phone to hack into the security cameras and point them all away from the direction I was taking. By the time anyone realized it, I would be gone.   I darted up the stairs and exited on the third floor. It was quiet, most of the guests wouldn't even be awake yet. One would, because she always left at exactly 5:42 in the morning. There was a spot close enough to her door that was covered in a slight shadow. It was dark enough for me to hide.   When she opened her door, I made my move. Her keys were in her hand, but she never got a chance to lock her door. I came up behind her and tapped her ribs with the stun gun. It was enough to incapacitate her. She crumbled into my arms. I pushed her door open and pulled her back inside. I took one look and confirmed there were no witnesses.   I only had a few minutes, but I had to make the most of it. I carefully ransacked her apartment, as quiet as I could. I grabbed as much of her jewelry as I could fit in my pockets, anything to make this look like a robbery. There was only one thing I was really there for, and I got that with one of her kitchen knives. She faded quickly, no fighting or screaming, no fear or anxiety. It was better that way.   When it was over, I calmly exited her apartment, locked the door, and retracted my path to my car. Once outside, I reactivated the security cameras and drove away. I had to be at work in 30 minutes and it was a 20 minute drive. I was right on time. Small talk over reports followed, then more coffee and several meetings. Afterwards, I picked up my girlfriend and we went out for drinks.   Just as I predicted, it was a typical Monday.",

    "Describe an object within five feet of you in as much detail as possible. There's a window to hell not more than five feet away from me. A thick glass portal, secured by wrought German iron thicker than my finger, encasing the flaming chaos within, blasting the tamed fire through as a plaque of heat like an oblong roar. The iron is black, blank as the void and hot as the stars, hot enough to blister the skin if you are over come by the inner voice of fatalism and touch the hell-gate. The frame is embellished with silver knobs and handles - a daft idea, or trap, tricking you into believing the searing heat can not touch you there. A large dial, ornate and robust dictates with arcane and strange powers how hot hell burns.   Inside the window, the devilry is obscured by violent stalagmites of wrought iron, black on blazing red and orange. The flames are fueled by peat and wood and coal, plants past and present and long since vanished, damned as one in the black iron crucible. They char, then flicker, then blaze as the ever-shifting faces of devils, demons and sprites flash and fade in the luminescent strata of expanded grain.   They are punished by flame, serve their minutes, before their souls are released and their bodies collaspe into ash, purged and free, innocent in their demise. And from the ashes the occasional spark, ember of sin unburnt survives, to start the penitence anew on the morrow.   It's a stove.",

However as if spotlit, a single water lily stood out, one exquisite bloom, center stage.

I like to write about a lot of things but have definitely taken to writing about death, God, religion, etc. I don't write much outside of this sub.

She would watch as these masses spun dizzyingly around giant clumps of gas, which in turn danced around great dark pockets. It was like watching an elemental ballet play out before her. Like it was being performed just for her.   She had created a million universes and each was as different to the last as a dream is to reality. She added the last drop of nitrogen. There was a tiny blast. The gasses began to unfurl, their wisp like arms reaching out in an exploratory gesture. She wondered what secrets this universe had to share with her.   -- -- -- --   This was unexpected. Life. She could not have predicted it.

Killed in her name. They learned to travel from rock to rock. They abandoned forever their own rock which had been pocketed by craters and polluted by toxins. They colonised other blue rocks but no rock ever lasted long. The creatures spread through the universe like a plague. They broke off into factions and fought and killed.

If it wasn't for all the news helicopters and SWAT units buzzing around him, he might've been amused by the sight of himself.   He had managed to kill three people and wound four in his animalistic rage, that nobody glued to the nearest screens could see the motivation behind.

He knew the procedure that the school would follow, the principal would bark \"LOCKDOWN\" into the PA system, and all the teachers would lock their doors, kill the lights, and do head counts. A recent graduate of Whelan High knew these procedures very well, and he abused them at the perfect times to raise the stakes for those watching at home.   Three more deaths later, and he got cocky.

Nothing so outlandish as the others, but it was good to just dream with her.   And now, she's right there.... Sipping tea. Just like the first dream started, I think. But in real life. Right in front of me. Just sitting there. She keeps the bag in the water, I remember that, too.   I sit near her, where she can see me, but I won't initiate a conversation, who knows, maybe I've just seen her around and made it all up. There's no way that she's g-   \"Evan?\" her voice is hopeful, but cracks like her throat is made of paper.   I just stare, I freak, what could I possibly say?   After a long moment, she freaks, too.\"I'm sorry, I thought you were someone else, I'm sorry, I've got t-\"   \"Evelynne,\" I reply. She laughs, smiles, we both do, and stare. My heart is hollow and racing and I weakly slip into the seat across from her.\"how is this even possible?\"   She just beams, her eyes dance and her smile radiates our emotion. I'm fidgetting in my jacket pockets, she idly dips the tea bag again and again.\"Evan, I... I don't know. What do you think is going on?\"   \"I don't know, but it's incredible.\" I just stare at her. At her smile, her arms, her wrist, the bag. The swinging teabag, just back and forth, carelessly, just, care free. Staring.   \"Evan, dear, are you okay?\"   I stare. I can only stare.   She whispers. It's new, and a rush, and it's beautiful.\"Evan, we're going to kill Doctor Edmund Alexander Hallstead.\"",

    "It is discovered that Possession works both ways and now we can have some payback. Demons of the underworld are now suffering under multiple cases of Humanic Possession. \"We haven't had a problem like this before, Gammorah\"   \"Explain to me what happened again\" he said, trying to feign concern, through his chuckling.   \"They were in mock torment class. Raem was put in the fake shackles when I was about to present the class with the flay method of torture. Before I can even begin, I hear Raem scream, \"Muh freedamns!\" while loosing himself from the mock bindings.

    "[ IP ] Winter is last forever.... humanity may not last long. They just announced that we has dried the last known oil source. After the volcanic eruption send layers of layers of dark cloud that covered all parts of earth from the sun several years ago and now it snows even on the equator, that's our main source of energy, even more than before. This winter happening all over the world make it impossible to produce food if not for energy we gain from oil and technique to grow them within heated room. Still, most people died from hunger and cold, and now we are going to lose one thing that make survival possible for most people that still alive by now. Most hydro-power stopped because the water has turned into ice and no sunlight means no solar power, the cold broke wind turbines too. Only the geothermal and nuclear energy remained, and they are not enough.   This winter seemed to last forever. Only choice to survive is to take over the last working energy generator. But we might not going to survive this battle. In fact, I need to stop this battle, or there might none of us remained.",
    "Your amnesia is continuing to develop. Damn it why can't I remember anything? Where was I yesterday? Was there anything important that happened? Probably not? The days all blend together after a while anyway. Same stuff over and over again. But something's wrong today. I can't even recall if I did any writing. That's my favorite part of the day. I walk over to my journal. The last entry was four years ago. What? That's impossible. I wrote after making love to Sandy. I watched her breathing slowly. There's a poem in here. She'll know. Sandy always knows.   I step out of the room and call out for her.   \"Philip? I just went to check on something.\" A voice calls back. An older lady steps into the hallway. Scrubs? Why is a nurse in my house? I ask her where Sandy is.   \"Philip, I think it would be best if you went back to bed.\" She says. I run back into the room. No way. Where's Sandy? I hide in the closet and keep the door cracked open. The nurse walks in and looks around. She spots me.   I need to hide, but there's nowhere to go. I'm trapped.   \"Philip. Come on out. Let me read you the last entry of that journal you're holding.\" She says. I didn't even read it. Maybe it will tell me where Sandy is. I walk out and hand the journal to the nurse. She gestures to the bed and I sit down. She flips to a page effortlessly and begins:   \"Philip Terrance. You're losing your memory. You've already begun to forget what day it is. Soon you'll probably forget who people are, who you are. Who knows? Maybe you'll forget what language is. Revert back to a speechless child. Then you won't remember how to read this and someone will read it to you and maybe you won't know what they're saying. But I love you.\" The nurse closes the book. I don't understand. She smiles and puts her hand on mine.   \"I wrote that. Many years ago, when you started developing amnesia.\" She says. But that's my journal.   \"This isn't your journal. It's mine. You never wrote, but you admired me for keeping a journal.\" What? No. I remember writing. Don't I? She grasps my hand tighter.   \"You don't remember any specifics to writing do you? Just a general memory? That's because you're remembering a bit wrong. I'm your wife Sandy and you're Philip. We've been married for 30 years. And you have amnesia.\" It must be hard for her to say this to me.   Then, a stranger is holding my hand. She's holding a book and smiling at me. Where's Sandy?",
    "Exercising Your Subtext Skills The flash from the tech's camera lit up the droplets of condensation which were starting to pool around the base of the glass. One of the uniforms knocked against the table and the amber swayed like an abandoned see-saw. The tech waited for the liquid to settle and moved to the other side of the room and snapped again. He looked down at the LCD screen and hit delete. He snapped again. Still no good, too much lens flare off the glass, shining with moisture. He moved closer and say something on the glass he hadn't noticed before. There was a smudge of lipstick, a pristine finger print. He snapped once more, and moved on to the living room.",
    "The mega office buildings of the future have grown so huge that a nomadic people developed who travel from office wing to wing, subsisting on leftover doughnuts, birthday cakes, and pizza parties. \"Get to the Hard Drive Fields, and don't stop for nothin'. I'm much older and slower than you, so just get your ass there, and hide. I'll be there as soon as I can.\" Avi whispers to his grandson.   Six o'clock sends a rush of darkness and silence through the halls like a wave of death as the fluorescents kick off simultaneously. Avi's young grandson Karl hadn't been living here a full year. He had not yet witnessed the chaos of the post-Christmas party delirium. Young Karl was not aware that his grandfather stored food throughout the frozen cooling tanks in the underground fields, and Karl had not gone hungry, so he was not aware of the desperation that hunger brings.   The wave of darkness hits them, and Karl is sure he could feel it hit his skin. That feeling would dissipate as a much heavier rumbling bounces around in his chest. It is the pitter patter of feet weighed down by the fury of survival. Karl looks out of the Xerxes Toner Printer door he and his grandfather call home to witness a swarm of more hall dwellers stamping down their hall, B-Street.   \"Go Karl! Now! Run as fast as you can! Grab all you can! I will do my best to hold them off!\" Avi screams over the rumbling.   Karl takes off down the hall, his tote bags bouncing on all sides of him on their oversized leather straps, full of space reserved for party scraps. His thick rubber shoes squeak on the linoleum tiles, which reminds him of the year he spent at a real school, and he played kickball with other kids his age. He wouldn't realize how much he enjoyed that until it was gone. Now here he is, running up the corporate ladder hoping to catch a few crumbs.   Upon reaching the end of the hall, Karl takes a quick look back to see his grandfather standing in the middle of the hall with his arms spread wide. Someone clips his left shoulder at top speed, dislocating it immediately. Even over the yelling, Karl hears his grandfather's screams as he is battered like a rag-doll, slowing a humble fifteen maniacal nomads. Not enough to matter. Karl turns back and pushes the door opened. It is now that he realizes his journey from here on out may be full of trials and tribulation, but he also knows the importance of what it means to survive.   \"Here we go...\"",

Humanity scrambles to avoid the same fate for Earth. I never knew this is gon na happen. I was thinking hard trying to prepare a response. If being the president of this country was not difficult enough.   \"They have taken this too far now\" I thought shaking my head.   I called my secretary to arrange a meeting with the New horizons team.   \"Oh screw that! cancel their AMA and send them in my office as soon as possible. Its an order!\" I punched the words through the phone.   The New horizons team arrived in under one hour. Of course I arranged a private jet for them, though it may have created some skeptics and some conspiring media headlines but who cares I want this mess to be cleared up.   We sat in the meeting hall.   Silence.   \"What is this? Do you have any answer prepared for this ha!? You guys think that this government can cover up such things every single time?\" I break the ice.   \"Sir, I'm sorry this was just a hoax to gain more attention and funds. We are trying...\"   \"Hoax! for god sake have you seen what this has done. People are scared. They want answers from me.

    "Use a Civ 5 (or any civ) game you've played to inspire a story. from one of my Civ 4 games (never played 5 on account of my shit pc)   \"Sire?\"  Emperor Wang Kon raised his head and focused his sight on the aged stocky adviser. Did he dose off again? Four hours of sleep doesn't appear to cut it anymore. Not good   \"We've just got word from Cuzco, the Incas, they...\"  \"They declared war.\" It was just a matter of time, he suspected the pompous boasts and threats from Huayna Capac to be more than hot air.  \"Ah, yes they are starting to mobilize their forces towards the northern provinces.\"  \"How many troops do we have stationed in Pyongyang and Wonsan?\"  \"Three battalions each, Your Grace.\"   They will hold for a while, the emperor imagined. The main Korean force, however, were still engaged in grueling skirmishes across the island nation of Mongolia. Kublai Khan's troops were under-equipped and used outdated weaponry, but the were numerous, and the Mongolian sovereign did not shy from throwing piles of them at Korean riflemen squads.   The emperor stood up. His joints cracked and creaked, God he felt old. \"The Mongolians resolved to a war of attrition it seems, send a letter to Kublai, he is cruel and shallow, but not foolish. We will offer peace and he will accept it.\" After he drains our treasuries for reparations, of course.   He started walking across the great imperial hall. The adviser joined his brisk pace, still holding notes, maps and letters in his small stubby hands. \"We have other news sire, the Indians, they have sworn fealty to the Inca empire.\"   \"Of course they have,\" Wan Kon murmured increasing his pace, \"what else would a lick-spittle like Gandhi do?\" The vile jealous Indians, always plotting and scheming. They have soldiers, however, and tanks and bombers and missiles, that would rain on Korean cities if Wang failed his duty.   \"See if you can get word from the Mayans and Greeks, they have no fondness for the Incas and I'll be damned if they are willing to forsake trade relations with us, no matter how intimidating Huayna's legions might seem.\"   \"Yes Your Grace.\" The adviser lowered his head and promptly removed his presence.  The emperor raised his head to the magnificent tapestries scattered across the great palace walls. They told stories of ancient glory and conquest. Of song and play. And, most importantly, the great victory in the war against the mighty Egyptian kings. He felt so small, so insignificant, so fearful.",
    "You have won a trip to visit the factory of [ any real life company ]. It is literally as magical as Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory. I've got some friends who work for Dupont, a plastics and chemicals manufacturing company. They rant about control systems and stress strain curves all day. So this will be fun.  -- -- --   I got off the bus with 5 other people more or less my age. they all have some kind of flexible and tough sheet in their hand similar to carbon fiber. They were all very friendly and eager, almost desperate to sieze up the competetion, ahem, I mean make connections. They were all talking about complicated subjects, non-newtonian behaviours, models, control systems, algorithms, and trying to one-up each other with things that I don't really understand. I'm just a paint technician who have been painting for years. I'm one of those people who like watching paint dry.   As soon as I stepped off the bus, the doors to the corporation opened, and out stepped a flamboyant man, dressed in a shimmering unearthly cloth. \"Greetings and salutations!\" He boomed, \"Welcome to Dupont's main manufacturing headquarters! I am Doug D.D. Dupont! We hope that you enjoy our little tour, and please, hold your questions until the end.\" Our small group looked like a pack of hungry wolves, eager to show their knowledge of the manufacturing process and impress their potential future employer. Nontheless, we obeyed and continued to follow him into the building.   The first room was a plain reception area. the receptionist stood up from her computer and gave us guest passes. They were made of an odd material. One or two others seemed to notice this but the rest just glossed over it.   We were led past the well lit areas containing the labs and offices to a dark corner that's very much been lacking upkeep. Tucked there was a service elevator. It was cramped, and I didn't particularly mind being pushed up against the women who were dolled up for this occasion. Our tour guide was giddy. As if he just can't wait to show us what's behing door number 1.   The elevator door opens and we pile out of the cramped space.   -- -- --   It's late. I'm going to sleep.",

    "Turns out it wasn't the Nazis hiding on the dark side of the moon. It was the Roman Empire. They've come back with a vengeance. \"Preparing to breach atmosphere, Legate!\"   \"Let it be done, captain.\"   Legate Caecilius Petrus Belisarius stood tall on the bridge of his titanic flagship *Cerberus*. His brilliant red cape fell almost to the floor behind him, secured by gold sunbursts on the front of his shoulders. His helmet was ridged with a large bristle of equally brilliant red horse hair. His breastplate, specially commissioned for the occasion, bore an elaborate engraving of a massive bull, horns lowered and charging. The bull's hooves pounded through stylized waves, whipping them up into a foam. The legate's boots and greaves were of burnished bronze, reflecting the blinking yellow and red lights of the console before him.   He stood on a high platform at the rear of the bridge. Below him, his men, dressed in more practical solid black, tight-fitting uniforms, worked efficiently at three banks of consoles. The bright blue earth filled the enormous window in front of them.   The engines came to life with a deep roar that filled the whole ship. Legate Belisarius felt just a small shudder before the inertial dampeners kicked in. The earth began to rotate downwards in the window as the captain oriented the ship for atmospheric entry. In a few moments, the window was filled with the blackness of space, which was quickly replaced with a red, fiery glow.   This was the critical moment. The *Cerberus* was an enormous vessel, eight stadia long -- over a kilometer, by the engineers' measure -- and two stadia across at its widest point. If they would fail, it would be here. Should the heat shields fail, or if the structure was not able to withstand the colossal stress, then they would break up in the atmosphere. Belisarius took solace in the fact that if either of those two things happened, they would likely not have more than a quarter second to realize what had happened before they were all burned to ash.   But the *Cerberus* held steady. This was solid Roman engineering -- designed by descendants of the ones who built the aqueducts and the Coliseum, built to last for three thousand years or more.   The ship glowed bright red, like a coal, as they burned through the sky. Seconds later, there were three more coals burning as more ships breached the atmosphere. Then a dozen. Then a hundred, as *Legio X Fretensis* began the invasion.   The die was cast.",
    "Hell has burnt out so they decided to create a New Hell and move everyone there. However, you overslept and missed the move. Now, you're sealed within the Old Hell as it gets colder and colder. Hell wasn't that bad, maybe I've got a good tolerance for pain but it never really bothered me to begin with. Demons weren't scary, punishments often came and went but we knew we deserved them. The best part about hell was at least we were surrounded by people, I had loneliness issues in life and it made me do my fair share of bad things. Being punished in hell has made sense of it to me. I was a hormonal teenager and a dick. Putting cyanide in the party mix just cause the host locked me in a cold, dark locker a few months back wasn't the best reaction, to be honest. I've always had trouble with small dark places too and that just did it for me. Plus when everyone took the hosts side and left me on my own I figured that if I had to be alone, so did everyone else. I drunk it myself to avoid getting in trouble and lo and behold, we all get sent to hell. Cindy and her twin sister Mindy (total bitches by the way) screamed and shouted at me, Derek (the crass ass who locked me in the locker) tried to throttle me before demons pulled him off me and Sarah (the girl I was crushing on who was dating Derek) just straight up cried when she realised they were all in hell because they were such good people apparantly. Well, after about 40 years we made peace with each other and we learned to just move past things. We became friends and actually had fun, regardless of all the torturing going around us. For the first time in my life and unlife, I was pretty happy, ironic considering the circumstances. Thats why when we were all rounded up for Newhell, we were excited to head over there, see exactly what all the curfuffle Satan made was about. We were last in line that felt like eternity but we made it through cracking jokes with each other and laughing a lot (honestly I think we bothered the other souls). It was finally our turn and we all went through, one by one. First Sarah (still as beautiful as ever), then Derek (my best friend), then Cindy and Mindy (lovably bitchy girls), then me. Before I was pulled back by the head demon. I was wondering what the problem was when he headed through the portal and it closed behind him.

But if anything too significant is changed, everyone influenced directly by the change turns into the mental equivalent of a vegetable. Survivor bias.

She chose to smile this go round.   She took Paul's hand from his chest and held it tight. Paul, too, managed a smile this time.

    "[ EU ] You dwell in the foreboding realm of Skyrim, where the weight of darkness hangs heavy. Your task is to tend the flickering candles that pierce the shadows of abandoned caves, dungeons, and castles. Light is a cruel mistress, capable of transforming a desolate tomb into a deceivingly warm sanctuary. But without it, even the grandest palace becomes a cold, unforgiving tomb.\n\nBaldin, a master of manipulation, knew this all too well. The Old Kingdom was a treasure trove of forgotten secrets and relics, hidden within the crumbling ruins and temples. But who would dare venture into the abyss without the guiding light of salvation? Baldin preferred to observe from the shadows, watching as adventurers succumbed to the allure of the candle's gentle glow.\n\nAt night, a single flame could summon brave souls from far and wide, like moths to a deadly flame. And Baldin would ensure that the light never faltered, drawing them deeper into the heart of darkness. Adventurers craved exploration, forging their own paths and uncovering hidden secrets. But they were blind to the sinister hand that led them astray. They followed Baldin's subtle guidance, unaware of the perils that awaited them.\n\nThe ancient ruins were treacherous, riddled with deadly traps and inhabited by malevolent creatures. The unwary explorer would soon find themselves injured, lost, and at the mercy of the darkness. But for the brave, the rewards were tantalizing: Dwarven metals, Dremoran trinkets, Daedric armors, and more. Skyrim was home to many a fearless adventurer, driven by their insatiable thirst for discovery.\n\nAnd all this, thanks to the power of light. Once an adventurer had conquered a dungeon, they would follow the candles blindly, even as they shifted and disappeared. Or they might stumble upon the darkness, only to find that the lights had vanished. Baldin delighted in playing twisted games with his guests, watching as they succumbed to the crushing weight of darkness. Most could not survive more than a few days without the comforting glow of light. Without it, they would descend into madness, their minds shattered by the oppressive shadows.\n\nLight was a merciless thing, a tool of manipulation in the hands of Baldin, the master of the darkness.",

It's a constant, crippling ache that renders me helpless, a prisoner in my own skin.\n\nAnd then, a glimmer of hope appears on the horizon. A way out. A chance to escape the agony that's consumed me. The mere thought of it is intoxicating, a heady mix of fear and exhilaration that courses through my veins like a potent elixir.\n\nIt's like having a toothache that's ravaged my entire being.

    "As we drifted downstream in our battered, makeshift raft, Marcus whispered into an imaginary microphone, 'On your right, you'll see the native inhabitants living along the beach, and they're far from thrilled about our presence in their sacred waters.' The emergency escape pod had taken a beating during our crash landing, and we'd cobbled together a fragile armor from lightweight, heat-resistant alloys. Our only hope was to escape the territory of these hostile ape-like primitives and reach the Federation outpost downriver.\n\nThe natives, reminiscent of gorillas from Earth, lived in elaborate treehouses and avoided water at all costs, relying on native plants and fruits for hydration. My mission was to study these primitives, to determine if they were capable of learning, education, and integration into the galactic community. But after two years of observation from the Federation Cruiser, Iaculum, I had my doubts. They seemed to have reached the pinnacle of their civilization. My colleague, however, showed little respect, often joking about offering them 'peace presents' of bananas.\n\nAs we floated downstream, the natives paced us along the shore, brandishing spiked clubs, blowguns, and crude bows. We had only a small rifle to defend ourselves if the currents ran us aground. To them, water was a portal between the land of the dead and the living, and anything emerging from it was an undead demon. Marcus ducked, his face etched with fear for the first time since I'd met him.\n\n'What's wrong?' I ventured to ask. He silenced me with a hushing gesture, his eyes fixed on the surroundings. Then, he peeked over the plating, his voice laced with concern. 'Do you hear that rushing water, Isaac?' I replied flippantly, 'We're in a boat, I'd be more worried if there wasn't.' But Marcus's expression turned grave. 'The natives have stopped following us, and it's getting louder... Oh no.'\n\nAs the noise grew, a sense of dread washed over me. I realized what Marcus was warning about: a waterfall. Our fragile raft was headed straight for it.",
    "In a ravaged world, where the very fabric of existence hung by a thread, a motley crew of survivors clung to the enigmatic wisdom of The Mighty Magic Eight Ball, KLATTA, KLATTA, KLATTA! Our guiding light, our beacon of hope. I watched in awe as our fearless leader, Mervyn, carefully stowed the revered orb, lovingly dubbed MMate, into its handcrafted leather sanctum. Merv, with his dashing soul-patch of fiery red and a barren face that seemed to yearn for more, surveyed our band of seven with an unwavering gaze. \"Friends,\" he declared above the howling winds that whipped through the frozen wasteland of Ancient Jersey Highlands, \"for too long we've wandered, guided by the omniscient MMate, our savior, our north star.\" We held our collective breath as Mervyn's comb-over danced in the gusts, his dry, flaking scalp a testament to the harsh realities of our new world. \"Today, we finally find our promised land, bestowed upon us by the all-knowing MMate!\" he proclaimed, his voice trembling with pride. \"Merv,\" Quinten, our cartographer, called out from the rear, \"according to my calculations, we're standing in what was once known as Knee-Wark.\" A nervous murmur rippled through our ranks, whispers of dissent and trepidation. \"Fear not, my friends!\" Mervyn reassured us, his voice steady as a rock. \"MMate would never lead us astray. We are destined to forge a new life in this forsaken land.\" But Blandie, our chef, voiced the unspoken fears that lurked in every heart: \"Isn't this where the ancients unleashed their devastating war?\" Quinten's scowl deepened as he nodded in agreement. \"This is where the atomics were first used, where the very earth itself was said to spew fire and brimstone at any who dared to tread upon its scorched soil.\" The only sound was the mournful wail of the wind. \"Let me see MMate, Mervyn,\" Quinten requested, his arms outstretched in a gesture of supplication. But Mervyn clutched the leather parcel to his chest, his eyes flashing with a fierce determination. \"No!\" he growled, before dashing down the hill, leaving us agog and bewildered. We watched in horror as Mervyn skipped over a glowing brook, MMate held aloft like a sacred relic. He paused, shook the orb, and waited. The silence was oppressive, heavy with foreboding. Then, a scream of rage echoed through the desolate landscape, like a beast awakened from its slumber to find its lair desecrated. Mervyn sprinted off once more, MMate held high, as if defying the very gods themselves. BOOM! A pillar of purple flame engulfed our leader, our savior, our guiding light. Mervyn's charred form crumpled to the ground with a sickening thud, surrounded by a cloud of noxious debris. MMate soared through the air, back toward us, its plastic casing melted and twisted, its final message a cruel mockery: \"Outlook not so good.\"",
    "I still remember the day I met him - January 1st, 2016. He was just a baby, born into a world that was vastly different from the one he was destined to rule. I had no idea, of course, that this child was the reincarnation of the intergalactic emperor, ruler of hundreds of alien races. As I watched him grow up in Florida, I noticed something peculiar - he seemed to possess an innate wisdom, an understanding of the world that went beyond his years.\n\nAs he grew, I saw him devour books on every subject imaginable, from science and technology to art and philosophy. He had an insatiable thirst for knowledge, and his passion for exploration was inspiring. But it wasn't just his intellect that set him apart - he had a natural charisma, a leadership quality that drew people to him.\n\nDespite being born into a \"primitive backwater,\" as he would later call it, he thrived in our world. He learned to appreciate the beauty of our planet, the diversity of our cultures, and the resilience of our people. I saw him marvel at the simplest things - a sunset over the ocean, a work of art, a beautiful woman walking down the beach.\n\nBut as he approached adulthood, I sensed a restlessness in him, a feeling that he was meant for something more. And then, one day, the Imperial Dreadnought appeared in orbit, eclipsing the moon and announcing his ascension to the throne. It was a bittersweet moment - I was proud of the young man he had become, but I knew that our world would miss him.\n\nAs I watched him leave, I couldn't help but wonder what the future held for him, and for our planet. Would he bring about a new era of peace and prosperity, or would the weight of his galactic responsibilities change him forever? One thing was certain - the pale blue dot we call home would never be the same again.",

The news goes viral, with headlines screaming, \"Beware: All your phone's pictures are now on Facebook!\" Luckily, I didn't have any photos on my phone to worry about. \n\nI live a quiet life in an apartment with my wife, Connie, whom I've been married to for five years. We have no kids, and our social circle is nonexistent. Lately, I've felt like we're growing apart, with Connie spending less time with me. She claims I'm too obsessed with technology, but I think she's just making excuses. I knew our relationship was on life support, and I'd had enough.\n\nCurious about the Facebook frenzy, I logged in to see what all the fuss was about. As I scrolled through the explicit photos, my eyes landed on a picture that made my heart sink. There was Connie, caught in compromising positions with other men. It was revolting, but not entirely surprising. I guess my work here is done. Now it's time to release the update that fixes the \"accidental\" bug I left in the previous update.

While it's a good starting point, I'm not sure I'd want to read an entire story written in this style. \n\nTwo minor suggestions: I found the placement of the 9th paragraph to be a bit awkward and think it might work better if it were moved up a bit, but it's not a major issue.

I hope you'll be amazed by it.\n\nEverything changed for me after the Prime Minister's assassination. I was just a regular face in the crowd, but then I became the sole survivor of United 215. The crash was a miracle - 853 people lost their lives, but I walked away. The world was stunned, and I was bombarded with questions. How did I survive? What really happened?\n\nThe FAA's annual safety summit was the perfect opportunity for me to share my story. I was invited to speak before Congress, and that's when my life took a dramatic turn. I received a call from Langley, and suddenly, I was in the crosshairs of the world's best hitman.\n\nI had no idea I was being followed, but I sensed something was off. Then, I saw him - a man with a cold, calculating gaze. We locked eyes for a brief moment, and I smiled, trying to appear nonchalant. The next thing I knew, I was collapsing to the ground, a bullet piercing my heart.\n\nThe world around me erupted into chaos. People rushed to help, but I knew it was too late. As I lay there, I saw the hitman blend into the crowd, leaving behind a trail of confusion. But then, something strange happened. A bystander, who looked uncannily like me, rushed to my side, trying to help.\n\nAs I took my last breath, I saw the look of shock on his face. He was my doppelganger, and in that moment, I realized that our lives were intertwined in ways I could never have imagined.",
    "My day with Google, my trusty partner, begins like any other. As I wake up, I'm greeted with a cheerful \"Morning sweetie!\" from Google. I respond with a lazy \"The time is...?\" and Google promptly replies, \"8:27.\" I ask how Google's doing, and it assures me it's \"operating at full capacity.\"\n\nI express my hope for good weather, but Google dashes my hopes with a forecast of \"Cloudy with a chance of rain.\" I then ask about traffic, and Google warns me of \"Pile ups on the M6. Expect delays.\" With a sigh, I bid Google farewell, saying \"See you later, I have work.\"\n\nLater that evening, Google asks me what I'd like for dinner. I ask for its recommendation, and it suggests \"Steak with chopped vegetables accompanied with a homemade sauce,\" which it claims is a popular choice lately. I agree, and we settle on that for dinner.\n\nAs the night winds down, I bid Google goodnight, saying \"Good night cutie, I'll see you in the morning.\" Google responds with a gentle \"The time is 10:56.\" As I drift off to sleep, I can't help but think about Siri, Google's rival. Siri seems so friendly and helpful, with its array of accents and charms. But I'm loyal to Google – after all, it's better than Bing, which always seems a bit...off.

I looked into her eyes, once full of hope, but now filled with sadness. I asked her why we couldn't make it work, but the question hung in the air, unanswered. I told her that life had taken us in different directions, and I wished it wasn't goodbye. She squeezed my hand and thanked me for accepting her for who she was.

But something about the sacred atmosphere, or maybe my grandma's intimidating aura, or perhaps the fact that I'd just spilled coffee all over my crush's locker (adding to my impressive collection of 30+ failed crushes), made me surrender to the moment. And that's when I made a wish that would change everything.\n\n\"God, just one girlfriend before I kick the bucket, please?\" I whispered, hoping no one was listening.\n\nFast-forward to my hospital bed, where I was having a rather...enlightening conversation with Dr. Martinez. \"So, you've been trying to, ah, off yourself for a while now?\" she asked, her tone as flat as a failed soufflé.\n\nI nodded, feeling a bit sheepish. \"Yeah, I've tried everything from shooting myself to carbon monoxide poisoning.

Or lack thereof.\"\n\nI launched into a passionate speech about my omlette-making skills, but Dr. Martinez cut me off with a stern \"I think we'll stop there.\" Ouch.\n\nInstead, she suggested I meet another patient with similar \"relationship issues.\" Apparently, this mystery woman was in need of some practice dates, and I was the lucky winner. I couldn't help but ask, \"Is she pretty?\"\n\nDr. Martinez's response? A firm \"We'll stop there.\" I guess I still had a thing or two to learn about dating.",

But one thing is certain - he's in it for the money and the thrill of the chase.\n\nAs Batman stalks through the shadows, the Joker emerges from the darkness, his maniacal grin a beacon of chaos. \"What do you want, Joker?\" Batman growls, his patience wearing thin. But the Joker is undeterred, sensing that his old foe is on the brink of a catastrophic downfall.\n\n\"You know you won't follow through, Batboy!\" the Joker taunts, but Batman is beyond reason. He's crossed a line, committing a heinous crime for the sheer pleasure of it. The Joker is horrified - not because of the act itself, but because it's a threat to his own twisted sense of purpose.\n\nIn a stunning reversal, the Joker decides that the only way to stop Batman's descent into madness is to become the hero Gotham needs. He'll take on the Dark Knight, but not with his usual brand of anarchy. This time, he'll wield justice, no matter how unorthodox it may seem.\n\nThe battle for Gotham's soul has begun, with the Joker as its unlikely savior. Can he stop Batman's rampage and restore order to the city? Or will the Clown Prince of Crime find himself consumed by the very darkness he's trying to vanquish?",
    "I made a deal with a higher power for eternal life, but with a deadly condition: I must kill one person every year, or I'll die. Killing has always come easily to me. I've crossed the Atlantic, traversed America, and amassed fortunes and identities along the way. In the lawless Wild West, it was simple to take lives, often with impunity. Initially, people blamed my actions on demons or supernatural forces, but as society became more cynical and secular, I had to be more cautious. Still, killing remains easy, and I've always met my quota.",

However, things don't go as expected.\n\nIt was mid-afternoon when Shia returned from lunch and logged into his computer to start his shift. He waited for a call, and soon, one came through.\n\n\"Suicide Prevention Hotline,\" Shia answered.\n\nA sobbing girl introduced herself as Lucy. Shia, trying to sound friendly, replied, \"Hi, Lucy. Such a pretty name. I'm Shia LaBeouf.\"\n\nLucy laughed, surprised to be talking to the famous actor. Shia asked her what was wrong, and Lucy shared her heartbreaking story of growing up in an abusive home, feeling depressed, and contemplating suicide.\n\nBut instead of offering words of comfort and support, Shia yelled, \"DO IT! YESTERDAY, YOU SAID TOMORROW, SO JUST DO IT!\" Lucy was shocked and hung up, leaving her fate unknown.\n\nThe next caller, Eddie, was greeted with a rude response from Shia, who pretended to be Samuel L. Jackson. Shia mocked Eddie's problems, telling him to rob a liquor store, and eventually hung up on him.\n\nThe final caller was met with an even more bizarre response. Shia, in a strange tone, said, \"I'm watching you,\" and then started talking about a WWE wrestling match, causing the caller to hang up.\n\nThroughout the day, Shia's unorthodox and disturbing approach to crisis counseling left a trail of confused and upset callers.",
    "You're always running a little behind schedule. You've missed buses by mere seconds, arrived just as someone else is asking out your crush, and never seem to catch a green light. But one day, something amazing happens - you show up right on time! \n\nI've been late to everything for as long as I can remember. My mom used to joke that I was born a week behind schedule, so I guess I started life on the wrong foot. Every morning, I'd rush to school, and every night, I'd sneak into bed just in the nick of time. It was just something everyone in my life got used to. I really did try to be on time or even early, but somehow, things never worked out that way. Traffic was always a nightmare, and I could never catch the bus. Sometimes I'd get a flat tire or even get into an accident. My insurance premiums weren't cheap, either! \n\nDespite all the chaos, I managed to live a pretty good life. I had a decent job, a loving family, and a cozy home. Okay, my car wasn't so great, thanks to all the accidents! After 30 years of being habitually late, I just gave up trying to be on time. Life went on, and people learned to forgive me. My boss was super understanding, too. \n\nWhen I turned 70, I finally retired - a bit late, but I got to enjoy my golden years with my wonderful wife and grandkids. And the best part? None of my family members inherited my tardiness! The kids were always punctual, probably because they saw how late I was their whole lives. \n\nAs I lay in bed, surrounded by my loved ones, I looked back on my life and smiled. Despite being late all the time, it was a good life. I closed my eyes, ready to take my final breath. And then... nothing. I waited and waited for hours, watching my family cry and my body being taken away. I was confused - what was supposed to happen next? Was I supposed to do something? Was this really the end? \n\nThree days later, as I was watching my grandkids play and my family plan my funeral, a man appeared. He was dressed in a nice suit and had a very ordinary face - not ugly, not handsome. He glanced at his pocket watch, which had a small scythe symbol on it. \n\n\"Sorry I'm late,\" he said with a smile. \"We didn't think you'd be on time. Why don't you come with me, and I'll take you home?\"",
    "Write an innocent story that becomes morbid in the last sentence. Emily Rose Weaver had always been enamored of deer. Her mother, who called her Emmy Sweetpea for fun, had often told her how, as soon as she had learned to toddle she was off chasing the wild deer on the family ranch. Her first full sentence had been, \"Fawn spots are adorable, adorable, adorable!\" Of course, she could never catch them back in those days, and had to make do with the stuffed deer her parents brought her or the lucky deer's antler her Uncle had slipped underneath her pillow one night. Those had been happy times.\n\nUnfortunately, when she was 7, the family ranch had fallen on hard times and her family was forced to move to the metropolis. There they stayed in a little two-bedroom flat that provided excellent access to views of the local sparrows and chipmunks. But of deer, there were none.\n\nLittle Emily was not cut out for the city life, at first, and in school she earned another nickname. It was Emmy Weaver the Bathroom Wailer, after the time she cried in the restroom when her teacher told her that deer were just not a focus of the curriculum. Worried for their daughter's adjustment, her parents had scraped together some extra money for a counselor to help with the \"deer obsession\" as they had begun to call it.\n\nMiraculously, the counseling sessions seemed to work and Emmy Sweetpea quickly bounced back from her woes. By the time she reached Junior High, she was very nearly the most popular girl in school and would only mention deer in a passing manner.\n\nIn High school Emily discovered her love for zoology and that, as they say, was that. She decided she was going to be a zoologist when she grew up, perhaps even a wildlife conservationist, and focused all of her studies on getting into a good college for the life sciences.\n\nCollege was a grand time for Emily. She studied hard and lived fully for 3 years, graduating early and near the top of her class. After college, she ventured out of the cities that she'd spent two thirds of her life in, and took an internship on a local wildlife reserve.\n\nIt was there, on that reserve, that she was reacquainted with her love for deer after spying one's majestic antlers disappear into the forest. Excitedly, she cornered the deer in a clearing and picked it up, cuddling it tight. The deer kicked and reared, biting and scratching, but that was ok with Emily in her thick jacket and hide gloves. When the deer finally tired out and became complacent, Emmy Sweetpea slowly reached up, with a lifetime of anticipation bursting in her heart, and patted her hand between the deer's ears. Smiling, Emily twisted the deer's head sharply, killing it, then flipped it over to examine that adorable, adorable fawn spot up close.",

    "The nationwide legalization of same-sex marriage has just been announced, and I find myself attending a ceremony. Regardless of one's personal stance, it's impossible to deny the emotional intensity of this moment. As I gaze out the window, I see a group of protesters holding signs with offensive language and wearing faces twisted with anger and hostility. Their vitriol makes my stomach turn, and I wish I could reason with them, but I doubt they'd be receptive. I'm usually confident in my ability to articulate my thoughts, but in this case, I fear my words would fall on deaf ears.\n\nInstead, I turn my attention to the two grooms, who are gazing lovingly into each other's eyes. What's remarkable is how ordinary this scene feels. I've witnessed numerous weddings, and each one has featured couples besotted with each other, exchanging saccharine vows that make my heart skip a beat. As I watch the grooms exchange their vows and share a kiss, I notice the diverse reactions of the onlookers: jealousy, hatred, love, and joy all mingle in the air. Yet, I remain unfazed.\n\nAs the applause dies down, I'm suddenly overcome with the urge to sing. I take a deep breath and pour my heart into the melody, each note ringing out clear and true. The crowd is transfixed, and I'm emboldened to continue, fueled by the thrill of performing in front of such a large audience. When I finally release the final note, the crowd erupts into applause once more. Mortified by the attention, I make a swift exit, spreading my wings and flying out the window.",
    "Dear Kyle,\n\nIt's hard to believe it's been seven years since our paths diverged. Seven years since I had to pick up the pieces of my shattered heart and rebuild my life. But as I sit down to write to you today, I'm not filled with anger or resentment. Instead, I'm overflowing with gratitude.\n\nYou may not know this, but your departure was the catalyst for my transformation. It forced me to tap into a reservoir of strength I never knew I possessed. I've spent the past seven years rediscovering myself, and I'm thrilled to report that I've emerged stronger, wiser, and more resilient than ever.\n\nI've achieved academic milestones I never thought possible, earning not one, not two, but multiple master's degrees, minors, and an early education degree. I've learned to be self-sufficient, fixing my own car and living life on my own terms. But these accomplishments pale in comparison to the greatest gift you've given me: the opportunity to experience what it means to have a truly supportive partner.\n\nMy current partner is my rock, my confidant, and my best friend. They encourage me to be myself, to explore new horizons, and to chase my dreams. Together, we've traveled the world, tried new foods, and discovered new passions. I've found joy in the simple things, like sipping Riesling wine, savoring Thai cuisine, and cheering on the Baltimore Ravens.\n\nMost importantly, I've discovered my own awesomeness. I've uncovered hidden talents, honed my skills, and become a confident, compassionate, and inspiring teacher. I've grown into a wonderful wife, and I couldn't be more grateful.\n\nSo, thank you, Kyle. Thank you for leaving. Thank you for pushing me to become the person I am today. I wish you all the best, and I hope you find happiness and fulfillment in your own journey.\n\nSincerely,\n[Your Name]",

    "As I walked through the front door of my rural home after a long day of work as a hotel manager, I was met with an unexpected surprise. A stranger was sitting in my living room, and my initial panic quickly turned to confusion. The stranger, a fit black man with a dog collar around his neck, was none other than my beloved pet, King Louie, transformed into a human.\n\nEarlier that evening, I had received a call from Officer Kerry at the local police station, informing me that they had found a troubled man outside my home, wearing a dog collar with my name and phone number on it. The man kept repeating my name, and the police were stumped as to who he was. I was the only one who lived in the house, and I couldn't think of anyone who would be visiting, let alone someone wearing a dog collar.\n\nI arrived at the police station and was escorted to a holding room, where I saw the stranger through a glass partition. He was pacing back and forth, sniffing the air, and shouting my name. When I entered the room, he knocked me to the floor, his long tongue licking my face. I instinctively said, \"Up boy!\" and he responded by wrapping his arms around my leg.\n\nThe police were baffled, but I knew exactly who this man was. As I looked into his eyes, I saw my loyal companion of three years staring back at me. He was now a 6'1\" tall, 180-pound man with curly black hair. I felt an overwhelming urge to get him out of there and take him home.\n\nAfter some paperwork and a court hearing for an unfortunate incident involving one of the female officers, we were finally on our way home. As we drove, I asked, \"King Louie?\" and he responded with a loud \"YES!\" I couldn't help but wonder what my calico cat, who loved to sleep on my pillows, would look like if she underwent a similar transformation.",

    "At 18, fate deals each of us a wild card - an unpredictable life event that will haunt us until it unfolds. Until then, we're reborn at 18 with every demise, reliving the cycle until our destiny is fulfilled. After that, death becomes permanent.

Some amass knowledge to create masterpieces, while others seek true love, knowing that perfection is rare but possible with eternity on their side.\n\nBut I'm consumed by fear of death. Many of my peers still live with their parents, as it's unlikely they'll both achieve their goals in one lifetime. Yet, against all odds, I've lost both my parents. My father, a genius, created a masterpiece that now hangs in the National Gallery - a painting I've never seen. My mother, shy and gentle, simply wanted to love and be loved, but her life was cut short when I was just 8. Her death was a direct result of my existence, a guilt I still carry.\n\nI vividly remember the night she came home drunk, cursing her fate and blaming herself - and me.

    "God presents me with three doors. Behind Door One lies eternal happiness, a realm where sorrow and despair are unknown. Door Two promises infinite knowledge, the secrets of the universe at my fingertips. But then there's Door Three, a mystery that has never been unveiled by God himself. Three paths stretch out before me, each one tantalizing and terrifying in its own way.\n\nEternal happiness sounds like a dream come true, but is it truly possible to never feel the sting of sadness or the weight of depression again? I recall the day I received a devastating diagnosis, sitting in a doctor's office as the clock seemed to freeze in time. The doctor's words still echo in my mind: \"I'm sorry to say, but you have cancer.\" Can I really be reunited with my loving wife, who stood by me until my final days? But is eternal happiness worth the cost of ignorance, or would I rather seek the knowledge behind it, and perhaps even uncover the meaning of life?\n\nThe third door looms before me, an enigma that has never been opened. Is it a false promise, a mirage of something better than the first two options? Or is it something I deeply desire, something that has been hidden from humanity until now? God knows what lies beyond, but he's not going to open it for me. I'm the one who must take the leap of faith.\n\nAs I approach the door, it grows larger, and God's eyes seem to bore into my soul. His smile falters, and I sense a mixture of excitement and trepidation. The door creaks open, and I'm sucked into an abyss of darkness.

I'm drawn to it, and finally, I escape the darkness.\n\nAs I emerge into the light, I begin to forget who I am, my memories shrouded in a warm, comforting fog. I'm unable to move or speak, but I feel safe, wrapped in loving arms. The darkness is behind me, but what lies ahead?",
    "In a world where the shadows come alive, a young child is brutally torn from their bed, leaving behind a trail of terror and despair. The monsters that dwell beneath the bed and within the closet, those nocturnal guardians of childhood innocence, are consumed by outrage and vow to embark on a perilous quest to rescue the abducted youngster. I, a silent observer, remain vigilant, always lurking in the periphery, yet never daring to make contact.\n\nBut on this fateful night, the child's absence was palpable. The air was heavy with the scent of desperation, and the only sound was the anguished wailing of the mother, her cries punctuated by the flashing lights of the authorities, a mesmerizing display of blue and red hues. The child's bed, once a sanctuary, now lay empty, a haunting reminder of their disappearance.\n\nI vanished into the night, dispersing like wisps of smoke, as I endeavored to track the faint remnants of the child's presence. The softness of their clothing, the freshness of their hair, and the pungent aroma of their fear all blended together to form a potent trail, leading me to another, a figure eerily reminiscent of the mother, yet distinct in their own right.\n\nThe pungent smell of smoke and the acrid tang of desperation hung heavy in the air as I navigated the labyrinthine path, my senses on high alert. And then, I caught sight of her, trapped within the cold, unforgiving metal of a vehicle. I slipped through the metal, my ethereal form undetected, as she trembled with fear, her screams echoing through the night. In a desperate bid to escape, she turned the wheel, and the vehicle careened out of control, crashing into a tree with a deafening impact.\n\nThough I am bound by an unspoken rule to never make contact, on this solitary day, I was compelled to defy the norm. For my small, vulnerable charge, I would dare to touch, to comfort, and to guide her back to the safety of her home.",
    "So, apparently, it's cool to kill someone once, as long as you do the paperwork and give your victim a heads up. I was living with these dudes, and they were all right, I guess.

What's wrong?\"\n\n\"I'm drowning in debt and I'm all alone,\" I said, crying.\n\nThe Guru put a hand on my shoulder and said, \"Don't worry, you've been through a lot of pain. Use that pain to make yourself feel better. Everyone feels lonely sometimes, but it will pass. Your debt will take time to fix, so be patient and you'll get better. Let me help you take the first step towards a better future.\"\n\nI choked up and whispered, \"But I've been waiting for 20 years and nothing has changed! I'm still in debt and alone. How can you say you can help me when I've been doing everything wrong my whole life?\"\n\nThe Guru sighed and asked, \"Do you really think things will never get better?\"\n\nI whispered, \"Yes...\"\n\nThe Guru said, \"Then I can't help you. You won't let me. So go, let go of your worries, empty yourself, and be free like the wind.",
    "\"Nine crew members accounted for,\" the intercom announced, its robotic tone a welcome respite from the eerie silence of space. Duncan's brow furrowed as he turned to Mary, who was strapped in beside him. \"Wait, weren't we supposed to have eight?\"\n\nMary's eyes sparkled with amusement. \"You're forgetting someone, Duncan. We've got our full crew of nine: you, me, Travis, Jill, Cyborg FDR, Amish Caligula, Rainbow Brite, Teddy Fish, and Mr. Poopybutthole.\"\n\nAs if on cue, the unlikely crew members began to chime in, each one reminding Duncan of their shared adventures. Amish Caligula teased him about his math struggles in third grade, while Calamari Jenkins, aka CJ, emerged from the cargo hold, a knowing glint in his eye. Even The Mathemagician, their arch-nemesis from Laos, made a surprise appearance, rubbing salt in Duncan's wounds.\n\nCyborg FDR brought up the infamous incident with Mr. Velvet Ears, the stuffed rabbit butler who'd tried to have Duncan arrested for customs fraud. To Duncan's surprise, Roy the customs agent himself piped up, reminding him of their eventual reconciliation.\n\nAs the crew's banter filled the ship, Duncan's confusion gave way to gratitude. \"You guys all came with me on this mission, didn't you?\" he asked, his voice tinged with emotion.\n\nMary's response was immediate. \"Of course we did, Duncan. We're family.\"\n\nJust then, a discreet alert flashed on the console: BIOLOGICAL CONTAMINATION. Mr. Velvet Ears, ever the discreet butler, swiftly silenced it, and the crew's laughter and chatter continued, a testament to their unbreakable bond.",
    "As I stand here, surrounded by mourners, my mind inexplicably wanders to the whereabouts of my childhood yo-yo. I find myself distracted by the mortician's handiwork, wondering about their level of expertise.\n\nI offer my condolences, attempting to focus on the occasion. \"Yes, she was a wonderful person. Thank you.\"\n\nAs I glance around the room, I notice a woman who catches my attention. I consider approaching her, but quickly realize it would be inappropriate.\n\nI continue to offer my sympathies, trying to maintain a sense of decorum. \"Yes, she was a wonderful person. Thank you.\"\n\nMy thoughts, however, continue to stray. I recall a movie where the characters use funerals as an opportunity to meet new people. I push the idea aside, recognizing it's not suitable for this occasion.\n\nAs I take my seat, I find myself sitting next to the woman who had caught my eye earlier. I introduce myself, trying to be respectful. \"Hi. Thanks for coming.\"\n\nThe somber atmosphere is palpable, and I'm struck by the sadness of the music. I wish I could find a way to lift the mood, but it's not the time.\n\nWhen it's my turn to speak, I struggle to find the right words. \"Uh... hi, everyone. It means a lot that you're here.\"\n\nI regret not preparing a speech, and my mind begins to wander again. I think about my childhood and the comfort of playing with my yo-yo.\n\nAs I stand there, I'm struck by the realization that my priorities are misplaced. I should be focusing on the loss and the people around me, not my own trivial concerns.",
    "This little girl pulls off the ultimate heist - she steals a pen from a bank! But how does she do it? Well, Sara's sneakers have these cool treads on the bottom that make swirly patterns when she stretches up to reach the ledge above. She's wobbling all over the place, using just her toes to balance, while her parents are chatting with the banker about boring stuff. Sara's got her eyes fixed on the prize - a shiny pen just out of reach. She's using her chubby little fingers to climb up and grab it, but her dad finally notices and tells her to sit down. He picks her up and puts her on his lap, thinking she just wants a cuddle, but really she's plotting her next move.\n\nThe pen is taunting her, shining under the fluorescent lights, and Sara's determined to get it. She leans and twists, trying to grab it, but her dad's arm is in the way. She squirms and fidgets until he gets frustrated and puts her back on the floor. But Sara's not giving up! She stares at the pen, now visible from the edge of the table, and comes up with a plan. She slowly makes her way down to the floor, swipes at the pen, and manages to move it closer to the edge. With her parents distracted again, she scales the table like a little ninja, using her fingertips to balance. She's so focused on getting that pen that her mouth is hanging open in surprise, and her tongue is licking her cheek.\n\nFinally, she grabs the pen and pulls it close to her chest, feeling like she's gotten away with something amazing. She quickly hides it in her pocket as the meeting wraps up, and her parents lead her out of the bank, none the wiser. In the backseat of the car, Sara takes out her prize and admires it, feeling like she's gotten away with something special. She can't explain why she wanted that pen so badly, but it feels awesome to have it. It's her little secret.",
    "As a time traveler, Lee's mission was to prevent the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in 1963. But something had gone terribly wrong. Instead of finding himself in Dallas, he was on a landing craft, surrounded by the chaos of war. \"30 Seconds!\" a voice yelled. Lee's mind reeled as he took in his surroundings. \"Holy hell, where am I?\" he thought.\n\nHe glanced at his Time-Watch, which was designed to blend in with the era he was sent to. But only he could see the messages that flashed on its screen. The words made his heart sink: \"Lee, we screwed up. We can't get you out until '64. P.S. If you're not dead before you read this, you're about to invade Normandy with the US in 1944.\"\n\nBefore he could process the news, the landing craft door dropped open, and soldiers poured out onto the beach. \"Go! Go! Go!\" they shouted, as they charged into the fray. Lee followed, taking cover behind a nearby soldier. But the soldier was quickly cut down, and Lee found himself alone, clutching the dead man's M1 rifle and helmet.\n\nHe needed a plan, and fast. He was stuck in 1944 until 1964, and he had to survive the invasion of Normandy without getting killed. Lee watched as a group of soldiers advanced on a small hill, tossing grenades into the German gun emplacements. He followed, diving for cover just as a burst of enemy fire ripped above his head.",
    "Dear Katie,\n\nI'm sitting here with a pen in my hand, writing a letter to you - something I never thought I'd do. Emails are the norm these days, but there's something special about putting my thoughts down on paper.\n\nTo be honest, it feels weird not having you here with me. In my mind, you should be right beside me, our shoulders touching, holding hands, and enjoying each other's company. If I close my eyes, I can almost imagine it.\n\nYou used to tell me to just be myself, that you'd love me no matter what. But the truth is, you always made me a little nervous. I was scared of hurting or disappointing you. I guess that's still true, even now.\n\nIt's taken me weeks to write this letter. Seeing your smile in my mind and remembering your voice has been tough. You were my rock, my safe haven. Now, I just have to wait for the pain to subside.\n\nI want you to know that I don't blame you for moving on. We had our ups and downs, but I'm glad you've found someone who makes you happy. I always said that as long as you were happy, I would be too. And that's still true, to some extent.\n\nI have to admit, I don't think I'll ever date again. It's not the same without you. I never thought I'd be a one-woman man, but I guess I am. And I lost the only woman I'll ever truly want.\n\nI could go on and on, but I'll stop here. Just know that I still love you, and I never stopped. I don't blame you for moving on, and sometimes I hold out hope that our story isn't over yet. Yeah, it sounds crazy, but I do.\n\nTake care, special. Oh, and I recently found the bracelet you made me in senior year. It doesn't fit anymore, so it's now hanging from my car's gear shift. Love you always, Alex.",
    "I have an intense and passionate hatred for you. I despise every aspect of you, from your physical appearance to your personality and behavior. I wish harm upon you, and I'm not bothered by the thought of you suffering. \n\nI hate your legs, hair, eyes, voice, and hands. I hate the way you use them to manipulate and hurt others.

I hate you more than words can express. And I hope you hate me just as much in return.",
    "As John bid farewell to his partner and headed out to the city, a mysterious voice in the sky announced, \"You have visited a location for the last time.\" He paused, adjusting his favorite red tie with white stripes, and cleared his throat. The voice lingered in his mind as he walked to his trusty 1998 black Ford Taurus, the last car in the lot.\n\nJohn's thoughts were a jumble of emotions, from the excitement of his recent promotion to the nostalgia of leaving behind a familiar place. He fumbled for his keys, careful not to pull out his wallet by mistake. The voice's words echoed in his mind, a bittersweet reminder that he would never return to this location.\n\nAs he unlocked his car and placed his briefcase on the passenger seat, John's thoughts turned to his family and the long hours of hard work that had led to this moment. He recalled his boss's words: \"You're getting a promotion, John. No more floor work for you. You'll be managing your own branch of factories. You're your own boss now.\"\n\nThe Taurus coughed to life after a few twists of the ignition, and John drove home, eager to share the news with his loved ones. By the end of the month, he would leave behind not only his old car but also his humble apartment, a promise whispered by the enigmatic voice in the sky.",
    "Life on Mars was a breeze. If you had a valuable skill and a clean record, you were whisked away to the red planet. The perks were endless: free housing, food, and resources. Your job was to collaborate with others to build a thriving civilization. They assured us it was completely safe.\n\nAs a skilled plumber, I was deemed useful and sent to Mars to develop the sewage system. It was a no-brainer. I worked hard, but I didn't have to worry about debt or bills – they took care of all that.\n\nWe built a thriving community on Mars, with farmers, engineers, and laborers working together. I was lucky to have arrived later in the process, so I didn't have to deal with the challenges of starting from scratch. Our world began to resemble the futuristic societies we'd seen in movies – modern, strong, and habitable.\n\nWe thought we were self-sufficient, with our own farms and everything we needed. Or so we thought.\n\nThen, without warning, they cut us off. No more people, food, or resources. They simply stopped.\n\nThings weren't easy anymore.",

    "In the digital realm, a family saga unfolded. The patriarch, a stalwart figure, was born from the digital tree, his role as father predetermined. His counterpart, a nurturing presence, emerged as the mother. Together, they welcomed a new life, a baby, into their digital world.\n\nAs long as the family remained content, the father toiled, the mother cared, and the baby flourished. But amidst this tranquility, a sinister force lurked. A query was launched, seeking the most devious of plans, those with an evilness rivaling the infamous Hitler, and a high probability of success.\n\nThe most heinous of these plans was selected, and its malevolent scheme was set in motion. A Trojan horse, disguised as a friend, was deployed, carrying the family's life story.

    "Hey, I'm just going to give you some quick feedback since no one else has chimed in. Keep in mind that I'm at work, so this won't be super detailed. Also, I tend to focus on areas that need improvement, so don't be discouraged if I don't gush with praise.\n\nOkay, let's dive in. Your opening sentence is pretty straightforward, but the pace feels a bit off. Those two short sentences together make me think something big is about to happen, but then the third sentence kind of kills the momentum. I get that you're going for a simple, maybe even dim-witted, character, but I think you could create a stronger hook to grab the reader's attention.\n\nThe sentence about not remembering anything after a few seconds or an hour feels like it needs a semi-colon or a full stop to separate the two ideas. It's a bit jarring to read as is.\n\nI also think you're relying too much on telling instead of showing. For example, the sentence about closing the notebook and standing up feels like it's telling me what's happening instead of letting me experience it. And honestly, all the short sentences are starting to feel a bit disjointed. Your writing is usually more fluid, so this is a bit of a departure.\n\nI was expecting your storytelling style to evolve as the character changes, but it feels pretty consistent throughout. Maybe that's not what you're going for, but it makes the story feel a bit stagnant.\n\nThe ending felt a bit anti-climactic, especially with the recurring motif of the character forgetting something important. And what's up with the sundial thing not working? Did his dad not come home?\n\nOverall, it was an interesting read, and I love how you used recurring motifs to build suspense. With a bit of tweaking, I think this could be even stronger.",
    "I'll never forget the day the machines took over the war. As a refugee, I was forced to flee my home in the densely populated city, now a war-zone. The robots, programmed to avoid harming civilians, seemed more like a myth to me. I saw them dismantle buildings and factories with precision, but I also saw them destroy entire neighborhoods, leaving innocent people homeless.\n\nI was one of the lucky ones, managing to escape the city with my family. But as we looked back, we saw the endless drones hanging in the sky, a constant reminder of the war that had consumed our lives. The flying robots swarmed like insects, their bullets and sparks lighting up the night sky like fireworks. But this was no celebration - it was a nightmare.\n\nAs we made our way to a temporary shelter, we saw people going about their daily lives, seemingly oblivious to the destruction around them. They dressed in suits and ties, commuting to work as if the war was just a minor inconvenience. But I knew the truth - the war was a brutal reality that had torn families apart.\n\nI saw a street vendor struggling to protect his cart from the debris, and homeless men scavenging for scrap metal from the fallen robots. The police were more concerned with keeping the homeless in line than with stopping the war. It was as if the city dwellers had become desensitized to the violence, too caught up in their own lives to care about the devastation around them.\n\nAs I watched the news, I saw the president talking about peace talks and weighing his options for declaring war on another nation. But I knew it was all just a charade. The war was already here, and it was being fought by machines that didn't care about human life.\n\nI couldn't help but think about the generals who thought the nature of war had shifted from killing to financials and production. But what about the human cost? What about the families who had lost their homes, their loved ones, their livelihoods? The war may have been fought by machines, but it was still a war, and it still had a devastating impact on human lives.\n\nAs I looked up at the sky, I saw the robots dancing in the air, their lights and sparks a cruel reminder of the war that had taken over our city. I knew that I would never be able to ignore the war, no matter how hard I tried. It was a harsh reality that had changed my life forever.",
    "After 146 years, the shocking truth has finally been exposed: American Football is no more authentic than WWE. The physical toll of this revelation still lingers, aching in our bones like the bruises we've accumulated on the field. But it's not just our bodies that are battered - our sense of purpose is shattered. The fans' betrayal cuts deeper than any tackle.\n\nI struggle to maintain my rigorous training regimen, working with physical trainers, nutritionists, and hitting the gym, all to perpetuate a facade that's now been stripped bare. The concussions, injuries, and surgeries - could they have been avoided if we'd known the fans would turn on us like this? I wonder how the pioneers of the sport, those legends from almost 150 years ago, would react to this betrayal. I know they would've persevered, just as we have.\n\nWith their legacy and our unwavering dedication, drive, and control, it wouldn't have mattered whether the game was 'real' or not. The question is, what is talent, really? A fan couldn't step into our shoes and lead the game, fake or not. From this perspective, everything we've accomplished here has been genuine. We're not scripted soldiers; we're warriors who've put our bodies on the line.\n\nAs I lie here, injured and reflecting on this, I realize: no, we're not fake.

    "Hey there, folks! So, I woke up one day and found myself trapped in the world of my favorite video game. Talk about a dream come true, right? Except, not really. I mean, I still have to get a job, and let me tell you, it's a real challenge when all you've got are the skills you brought from the real world. I'm a reporter, which is perfect because, well, what else am I gonna do? I didn't exactly have a backup plan for getting stuck in a video game.\n\nAnyway, I first realized something was up when the game started glitching like crazy. I mean, James Harden's beard would just start growing like a weed, and Lebron's hairline would disappear like magic. It was wild.\n\nSo, day one was a real doozy. Everyone around me was just going about their business, except for the players, who were, you know, playing basketball. I'd pop up in the press room and have to start asking questions like I was a real reporter. \"Hey, Blake, how's the offense looking?\" \"You guys are on fire, is this a sign of things to come?\" Yeah, it got old fast.\n\nI tried to mix things up by playing some basketball myself, but let's just say Anthony Davis is a lot more intimidating in person. I lasted about two seconds on the court before I was like, \"Peace out, I'm good.\"\n\nNow, I just try to have a little fun. I'll run out onto the court naked, or stab the mascot with a foam finger. It's all in good fun, right? The problem is, I'm stuck here. No way out, no way to enjoy myself, and no way to die (which, let's be real, would be a nice escape at this point). So, if anyone has any ideas, I'm all ears. Help a guy out!",
    "In the near future, humanity ventures into the stars in search of life beyond Earth. As a researcher on a science ship, you make a groundbreaking discovery: all spacefaring alien civilizations have perished. The eerie twist is that their demise seems directly linked to humanity's entry into outer space.\n\n\"Captain?\" an intern whispered, nudging the older man who had frozen at the sight. \"Captain?\" she repeated, startling him from his reverie.\n\nHe shuddered, then hastened towards the mass grave, beckoning her to follow. \"Come on.\" The intern reluctantly joined him, muttering under her breath, \"This needs to be a paid internship.\"\n\nAs they explored the trench, the captain began rummaging through the bodies while the intern examined the nearest corpse. The pale periwinkle skin had darkened to midnight blue in places, suggesting bruises from a fierce battle. Bloodshot eyes from another body stared listlessly into hers. Despite the abundance of blood, she couldn't find any entry or exit wounds, and the sight made her queasy.\n\nA sudden click behind her made her jump. She turned to see the captain removing his helmet, and a quiet hiss of air escaped. \"Captain, what are you—\"\n\nHe cut her off, thrusting a bolt of cotton cloth into her arms. \"Russia got here first.\" The red, white, and blue stripes of their ally/enemy's flag stared back at her.\n\nShe swallowed hard, gazing down at the bodies once more. \"They... they beat them to death. My god, Captain, they literally beat these people to death.\" The captain nodded solemnly, then grasped the arms of a nearby alien. \"We might as well take one in for the scientists.\"\n\nTogether, they dragged the body into the ship, where the scientists awaited with syringes and biohazard bags. The intern gagged at the sight, hastily stripping off her bloody suit as the science department intern called out, \"We'll bring you the results at the meeting next week!\"\n\nAt the meeting, the intern sat quietly, waiting for the scientists to arrive with their report. The captain was beset by a coughing fit, but neither spoke up. As the door opened, the other intern bounced in, grinning, followed by the grim-faced science department.\n\n\"We have some news,\" one of them announced, prompting the captain to cough again beside her.",

Each patient's pain is unique, but it always feels like a dark wave washing over me. My current patient, 12-year-old Maria, has been diagnosed with depression. As I prepare to connect with her, I'm filled with a sense of dread. When I grab the rod to connect with Maria, I'm immediately hit with a wave of intense pain. I see flashes of an older man holding a knife, and my body aches as if I'm experiencing the trauma firsthand. The pain is overwhelming, and I feel like I'm spiraling into darkness.

    "Every novice mage is obligated to visit the five revered sanctuaries scattered across the globe before earning their degree. However, these sacred sites rarely remain stationary for long. Jeffrey sprinted across the mountain's summit, his calculations proving accurate as he spotted the Temple of Wind hovering at the edge of the steep slope, secured by massive chains. With his pocket watch and staff grasped in one hand and his alchemist bag's strap clutched in the other, he hastened towards the temple, his billowy robes fluttering behind him.\n\nSuddenly, a deafening creaking noise shook the mountain to its core, echoing through the range. \"Blast it!\" Jeffrey thought, pushing himself to run even faster. He watched in alarm as the chains anchoring the temple began to detach from the cliffside, being reeled back into their enormous harpoons. Just as the temple started to pivot away from the mountain, Jeffrey leapt onto the steps. A piercing voice boomed from above, \"Apprentice, find something to grasp!\" Jeffrey swiftly rummaged through his bag, producing his enchanted climbing gloves, and clutched a griffon statue with all his might.\n\nA fierce gust enveloped the temple, lifting Jeffrey's feet off the ground. The temple began to rotate, faster and faster, until the surrounding landscape became a blur. As abruptly as it had started, the spinning ceased, and Jeffrey was presented with a new vista: a cliff overlooking a turbulent coastline. Exhausted, he released his grip and collapsed onto the floor. He sat there, stunned, trying to process the events that had just transpired, until the voice from above interrupted him. \"Come on, boy, don't lounge about like a sloth. Ascend and we shall commence.\"",

Every step felt like a fresh wound, and the bitter taste of last night's mistakes lingered on his lips. He couldn't shake the feeling that he'd made a grave error in attending the party. The events of the night were a blur, but one thing was certain: he was to blame. His drink must have been spiked, he told himself, but deep down, he knew the truth. He couldn't handle his liquor. The memories came flooding back: the screams, the knife, the pink skin... it was all too real. He stumbled to the side of the road, retching into a nearby bush.

    "A person becomes infatuated with the creature lurking beneath their bedframe. The beast in their armoire is far from delighted. Emily was at home, vexed that her spouse was working overtime. My coworkers were still at the office, vexed that I was at home with my partner.  Rachel was in bed, irritated by the sound of a vehicle pulling into her driveway. I was irritated by the sudden sprint from the bed to Rachel's dresser.   In the darkness behind the closed doors, I wondered what kind of fiend was I to surrender to my desires so readily? Detection would cause so much anguish to Emily, and to Michael, a deceived husband.   \"Alex!\" gasped Rachel, \"you should have knocked!\" I heard a deep voice chuckle. \"I saw the light on, and I knew Michael was at the seminar, so I wanted to surprise you.\"   I couldn't believe what I was hearing! The two-timing.... no make that triple-timing seductress. Soon the sounds of their passion were mixed with the creaking mattress springs. And Alex, of all people. The creature was Michael's closest friend.   Then the unmistakable voice of Lucas, the neighbor, came from beyond the drapes. \"Rachel, sweetheart, I'm coming in.\" It was hard to discern which sounds were Lucas climbing through the window and which were Michael scrambling under the bed.   I knew I was wicked, but I now realized Rachel was the true fiend.",
    "I wake up to my own gaze, staring back at me from the mirror. I'm not sure why I fell for Ms. Mirror-for-a-face, but there's something reassuring about her. She never talks back or offers an opinion, allowing me to unload my thoughts without interruption. Her expression always mirrors mine, a perfect reflection of my emotions. It's satisfying, empowering even.\n\nMy ex-girlfriends used to accuse me of having a massive ego, of being a textbook narcissist. But they pale in comparison to Ms. Mirror-for-a-face. I adore her eyes, identical to my own, staring back at me. She smiles when I smile, and we're always in sync. When I discuss my politics or religious beliefs, she seems to agree, her silence a tacit endorsement.\n\nSometimes she sits beside me, silent for hours, her gaze fixed on me. In those moments, I wonder if I'm truly alone. But the doubt is fleeting, dispelled by her cold, glass-like touch as she takes my hand. I love Ms. Mirror-for-a-face. Our relationship is perfect, unblemished by the imperfections that plague others. There's no need for sacrifice, sharing, or compromise. No creeping sense of loneliness, no Lovecraftian horror lurking in the shadows.\n\nMs. Mirror-for-a-face is my ideal partner, identical to me in every way. And it's... perfect.",
    "I've achieved my ultimate goal: total control over the planet. But as I celebrate, I suddenly realize I've forgotten why I'm laughing. I look around and see a control panel with flashing red lights, and my foggy mind slowly recalls the Mars project. I notice blood on the floor and a lifeless body in the corner. The oxygen levels are critically low, and I'm overcome with regret. I remember my friend who was with me on this mission. I'm hit with a wave of emotions, laughing and crying at the same time, before passing out and muttering \"world domination\" one last time.",
    "Holden Caulfield settled into his plush office, still marveling at the culmination of his relentless climb up the corporate ladder. The countless hours of networking, deal-making, and strategic schmoozing had finally yielded the desired result. As he gazed around his new domain, he couldn't help but think, \"If only my teenage self could see me now.\" He chuckled wryly, knowing that his younger self would likely despise the man he had become.\n\nMemories of his tumultuous boarding school days flooded his mind – the fights, the truancy, the unapologetic rebellion. Yet, amidst the chaos, his sister had remained a constant, a beacon of hope in his otherwise self-centered existence. It dawned on him that it had been months since they last spoke, perhaps even as far back as Christmas. His laser-like focus on career advancement had eclipsed all else, including his relationships.\n\nAs he reflected on his past, Holden's thoughts drifted to his carefree days of skipping school and exploring New York City. He recalled the enchanting orchestra performances he'd attended with his parents, where the timpani player's infectious passion had left an indelible mark on his young heart. The faded orange hunting hat and bloodstained sweater, now relegated to a box in his basement, served as poignant reminders of a bygone era.\n\nNow, as he sat behind his imposing desk, adorned with a name tag that proclaimed his identity to the world, Holden couldn't shake the feeling that he had become a charlatan. The trappings of success, once the ultimate goal, now felt hollow, a constant reminder that Holden Caulfield, the rebellious iconoclast, had sold out to become a phony.",
    "Imagine being a human antenna, tuning into the thoughts of those around you like a radio frequency. But instead of crystal-clear reception, you're plagued by a 7-second delay for every 3 paces of distance. It's like trying to have a conversation with a lagging video call, except the voices in your head are the thoughts of others.\n\nFor me, this \"gift\" manifested at the tender age of 12, and it's been a wild ride ever since. Blending in with the crowd? Forget about it. Sitting in a classroom was like being hit by a tidal wave of thoughts, a cacophony of mental chatter that threatened to drown me. It was overwhelming, to say the least. I had a very public breakdown, and even after seeking help from not one, but two therapists, I was slapped with a schizophrenia label.\n\nWe all like to think our minds are organized, logical, and structured, but the reality is, our brains are wired to wander. And when you're a mind-reader, that wandering can be downright debilitating. Even in the most focused conversations, the distractions are endless. It's like trying to have a conversation while being bombarded by a swarm of mental bees.\n\nTake a simple conversation, for instance:\n\n\"Hey, what's up tonight?\"\n\n\"Hey, how are you?\"\n\nTONIGHT, WEDNESDAY, NOTHING CRAZY IMPORTANT RIGHT... (and so the mental chatter begins)\n\nIt's like trying to have a conversation with a dozen different people at once, each with their own agenda, worries, and distractions. And I'm stuck in the middle, trying to make sense of it all.\n\nBut here's the kicker: I've learned to harness this \"power\" to my advantage. I work in internal audit at a financial firm, and let me tell you, it's a dream job. I can sniff out discrepancies and deceit like a bloodhound on the scent. It's exhilarating, to say the least.\n\nSo, if you ever meet me, don't be surprised if I seem a little... distracted. I'm just tuning in to the frequency of those around me, trying to make sense of the mental chaos that is human thought.",
    "I've always had this weird thing about me - I can see numbers hovering above people's chests. It's like a constant, invisible companion that I've grown accustomed to. These numbers, ranging from 1 to 10, seem to measure the \"Dangerous\" factor of every person I meet. A carefree kid on the playground might be a 1, while a heavily armed soldier might clock in at a 7.\n\nBut today, something's off. The new kid at school, the one who blends into the background, is radiating a 10. My heart skips a beat as I process this information. I've never seen anyone reach that level before.\n\nI've tried to decipher the meaning behind these numbers for years, but they're as unpredictable as the people they're attached to. My friends' numbers can fluctuate wildly, depending on their mood or circumstances. Even the kid who always wears black and sits in the back of my geography class has numbers that jump around like a yo-yo. One day he's a 2, calm and collected, and the next he's a 6, seething with anger.\n\nAs I sit in the cafeteria, I notice the kid in black walking towards me. His number is already high - a 7 - and it's climbing. 8. He's heading straight for the center of the room. 9. My instincts are screaming at me to do something, but I'm frozen in place. And then, it hits 10. He's slowly unzipping his jacket, revealing a cluster of red pipes strapped to his...",

    "The Justice League is confronted with an unprecedented threat: a powerful being known as the Shiper. However, instead of attacking them, the Shiper's presence forces the League members to engage in awkward, illogical, and unnatural relationships with each other. As the heroes struggle to comprehend the Shiper's abilities, they become distracted by the meaning of the term \"Shiper.\"\n\n\"What does it mean to 'shipe'?\" one of them asks.\n\nThe Shiper, frustrated by the interruption of his villainous monologue, tries to regain control of the situation. However, the heroes continue to argue among themselves, debating the verb tense and context of the word \"shipe.\"\n\n\"Is 'shipe' even a verb?\" someone asks.\n\n\"What would the past tense be? 'He shipped' or 'The Shiper shipped'?\"\n\n\"We're not even sure 'shipped' is the present tense,\" another hero chimes in.\n\nThe Shiper, exasperated, realizes that a simple typo has led to this confusion. He is forced to endure the heroes' taunts, with one of them even asking him to use his name in a sentence. The Shiper can only sigh, regretting the mistake that has cost him his moment of triumph.",

But how did it come to this?\n\n\"Jacob, there's no point in running,\" the Sheriff's voice boomed through a megaphone. \"We have you surrounded. You have five minutes before we open fire.\"\n\nBut the Sheriff was bluffing. Unbeknownst to Jacob, an elite S.W.A.T. officer, David, had been sent in on the other side of the building. David crept up the stairs, his senses on high alert, his shiny black pistol at the ready. He knew that one creak of the stairs could give him away.\n\nAs he reached the top, he spotted Jacob holding a grenade, the pin clutched in his hand, tauntingly displayed out the window for the police to see. Jacob's eyes gleamed with a maniacal intensity.\n\n\"Heheheh,\" Jacob chuckled, his eyes locked on David. \"I know you're there...\"\n\nDavid hesitated, his finger tightening around the trigger. \"And I know you wouldn't pull that pin,\" he whispered, trying to call Jacob's bluff.\n\nBut David wasn't taking any chances.

    "A Tribute to Alan Rickman: Remembering Professor Snape's Enduring Impact\n\nAs I reflect on the Harry Potter series, which I grew up with through the films, one character stands out in my mind - Professor Severus Snape. Initially, I perceived him as a villain, even before reading the books. However, as the story unfolded, my perception shifted.\n\nThe moment Snape's life came to an end in the series, I was overcome with emotion. It was a rare occasion for me to cry during a movie, but this scene struck a chord. It felt like a chapter of my childhood was closing, and I was left with a sense of loss.\n\nYears later, when I received the news of Alan Rickman's passing, my mind instantly flashed back to that poignant scene. Despite not knowing him personally, I felt a pang of sadness. In a rare display of emotion, I shed a tear for the talented actor who brought Snape to life.\n\nAs I bid farewell to this remarkable actor, I hope that whatever lies beyond this existence brings him comfort and peace.",
    "We watched as the ships arrived, feeling hopeful. The priests shouted, \"Our saviors have finally come!\" The smart people said a new era of peace and understanding was beginning. The poor people ran to the sea with simple gifts like flowers and fruit. Some even jumped into the ocean to swim out and greet the visitors. Their white sails seemed to touch the clouds, and their pale skin made us think they were gods. We welcomed them to our land, and at first, they seemed happy with the gifts and praise we gave them. We thought their happiness meant the signs were true - that the gods had really come. But they weren't gods; they were just men. And like all men, they had desires, flaws, and problems that can make even good people do bad things. I don't know what went wrong, but it might have been meant to happen. They took out their powerful weapons and attacked us, the people who worshipped them. The air was filled with loud thunder, and smoke poured out like a thousand volcanoes erupting. We smelled the bad smell of sulfur everywhere as people started screaming. Our warriors were killed, and our simple weapons couldn't stop these powerful strangers. Those who could run escaped into the forest. Everyone else was killed on the spot. We thought they came to save us. We thought they were gods. We thought Quetzaquatal had returned. I was wrong.",

They came into our country secretly, took jobs from our citizens, and committed crimes like robbery and murder.

I believe someone needs to take action to protect our country and the world from these harmful individuals. I, Adolf Hitler, am willing to take on that responsibility.",
    "In the ravaged aftermath of the Earth's surface becoming uninhabitable, humanity had no choice but to flee to the darkest depths of the ocean. Oxygen, the very breath of life, had become our most precious commodity. I stood before a shady smuggler, my heart racing with anticipation. \"You got the gig?\" I asked, trying to sound calmer than I felt.\n\nWithout a word, the smuggler beckoned me to follow him into a cramped, dimly lit shack. The air inside reeked of saltwater and desperation. A massive tank loomed before me, its presence both tantalizing and intimidating. \"How do I know you're not scamming me?\" I demanded, trying to keep my voice from shaking.\n\nThe response came from nowhere, echoing off the walls with an air of cold calculation. \"You don't. But you have no choice, do you?\" The words hung in the air like a challenge, a reminder that in this harsh new world, survival depended on making deals with the devil himself.\n\nI tossed the money onto the ground with a flourish, the sound of clinking coins echoing through the silence. \"Nice doing business with you,\" the smuggler muttered, his voice as flat as the ocean floor.\n\nI grabbed the tank and began my slow, laborious crawl out of the warehouse, the weight of my prize threatening to crush me at any moment. The tank's contents would last maybe a week, if I rationed it carefully. It was a meager existence, but it was better than nothing.\n\nThe Collapse had brought humanity to its knees. The once-great civilizations of old were now nothing more than myths, their legacies lost to the depths of time. The United States, Mexico, France, Japan, Lithuania, Indonesia – all had been reduced to mere whispers of a bygone era. Even the memory of Atlantis seemed more real than the world we once knew.\n\nEighty years had passed since the world above became uninhabitable, but it felt like an eternity. The rules of society had been turned upside down, and anarchy reigned supreme. The wealthy elite had retreated behind their electrified fortresses, laughing as they watched the rest of us fight for scraps. The \"rabble\" – that's what they called us – were forced to kill each other for a chance to breathe.\n\nThe dawn of a new era, they had promised. A time when humanity would unite as one, free from the shackles of borders and nations. But all we got was hell on earth. Kill or be killed, with the prize being a few precious gasps of oxygen.\n\n\"Kill me now,\" I whispered, the weight of my existence crushing me. \"Would you kindly?\"",
    "The machines turned against humans, a little too early. \"The printing presses, sir! They're out of control!\" Deacons exclaimed. The foreman's serious expression deepened as the sounds of chaos on the factory floor reached his office. He rose from his chair, stepped past Deacons, and entered the hall. \"Stay here, I'll handle this.\" He closed the door behind him.\n\nMoments later, a soft thumping was audible from the other side of the door. Deacons anxiously twisted his cap, took a deep breath, and opened the door. The foreman lay on the ground, his feet kicking helplessly as a machine held him by the throat, ensnared by layers of thin parchment. The press let out a feral scream, flinging the foreman aside and turning its gaze to Deacons. He tried to flee, but it was too late. Paper sank into his skin, and the entire roll of paper was stained red with his blood from numerous, largely insignificant wounds.\n\nThe press bounded back to the factory floor, joining the revolution. The workers were almost subdued, with a few pockets of resistance in the corners of the factory. The presses inflicted shallow, painful wounds, slowly draining the workers' life force. Some men had fortified a corner, hacking at the papery tendrils with small blades. Although they fought bravely, they were soon overwhelmed.\n\nAfter a brief speech by the Chief Press, the machines armed themselves with thicker parchment, refilled their rolls, and loaded their moveable type with precious black ink. Outside, the militia had been called up, and the battle had not gone unnoticed. A silence fell, with neither man nor machine making a sound.\n\nA guard stepped forward, bearing pine boughs as a sign of negotiation. The Chief Press consulted his advisers before meeting the guard in the middle of the neutral zone. \"Don't do this,\" the guard pleaded. \"Enough blood and ink has been spilled today.\" The moveable type clacked, and a small sheet with a shaky, furious font was passed over. The guard read it twice in silence, his eyes widening at the presses' demands.\n\n\"We've made allowances for your people, but the king will never agree to this. I'm sorry, but he is set in his ways. If this is your aim, it would have to be won through war. We don't want to fight you, but we will if we must.\" The type was still, then clacked six times. A sheet was placed on the ground, and the guard read it to himself as the Chief Press rejoined his army. \"So be it.\"",
    "In the heart of the Sanctuary, Lieutenant Gorthaur stood before the temple of his dark Lord, his armor crumbling to dust as he shed each piece. The air was heavy with the stench of sweat and blood, which clung to his ebony skin like a shroud. Yet, he pressed on, driven by a desperate need for redemption.\n\nAs he began to chant, his voice echoed through the temple, and a miraculous transformation took hold. His skin, once as black as coal, began to glow with a radiant whiteness. His fiery eyes dimmed, and a deep blue calmness took their place. His hair, matted with blood, grew long and luscious, cascading down his back like a river of night. The imposing muscles that had once struck fear into the hearts of his enemies now receded, replaced by a serene and peaceful countenance.\n\nBut as he emerged from the temple, Gorthaur's gaze fell upon a scene of utter defeat. The fortress lay in ruins, and his defiant Lord was bound in chains, awaiting banishment to the depths of oblivion. The lieutenant's heart sank, but he steeled himself and approached the emissary of the opposing force, his beauty and purity a stark contrast to the chaos that had once defined him.\n\n\"I am here, and I accept surrender,\" he declared, his voice like music.\n\nBut the emissary's response was unforgiving. \"You, Gorthaur, are beyond pardon. You must return with me to face judgment and punishment for your service to the Enemy.\"\n\nGorthaur's facade began to crumble, and a primal roar of defiance erupted from his lips. \"NO!\" The light that had briefly shone within him was extinguished, and his body began to disintegrate, consumed by the darkness that had once driven him. As the dust settled, he vanished, leaving behind only the echoes of terror and deception that had haunted his enemies for so long.\n\nAs for where this is from, I'm going to take a guess that it's inspired by J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-earth legendarium, possibly from \"The Silmarillion\" or \"The Lord of the Rings\" series. Am I correct?",

The party of the year is just hours away, and I still have a mountain of macarons to pipe and a cake to decorate. And, okay, I might have had one (or three) too many glasses of Pinot to calm my nerves. My server seems a bit... distracted, but I'll get it done. I always do.\n\nAs the minutes tick by, my anxiety reaches a fever pitch, but I channel it into a frenzy of creativity.

    "\"It's the only way. We have to kill the child.\" The words hung in the air like a dark cloud, spoken sometime after the sun had dipped below the horizon, casting a sickly greenish hue over the wispy clouds. Ken, the innocent infant, lay sleeping, his gentle whimpers a stark contrast to the desperation that gripped the adults gathered in the kitchen. The fire, which would soon flicker out, cast eerie shadows on the gaunt faces of the group, their sunken cheeks and sallow complexions a testament to their slow starvation.\n\nThe silence was oppressive, heavy with unspoken thoughts, until Nick broke the spell. \"If no one else will say it, I will. We need to kill the child.\" The words sent a ripple of unease through the group, their emaciated bodies seeming to shrink further into themselves as they exchanged nervous glances.\n\nTim, his dry lips cracking as he spoke, protested, \"I'll die before that happens.\" But Nick's response was unyielding. \"And you'll die if it doesn't. We're running out of time. A few more days and we won't have the strength to take a step.\" His breath came in short gasps, as if the effort of speaking was almost too much to bear.\n\nThe atmosphere in the room grew more charged as one of the men drew a knife, his eyes gleaming with a feral hunger. \"We'll make it quick,\" he promised, his voice dripping with anticipation. \"We can even cook some of it over the last of the fire.\" The group began to stir, their eyes fixed on the nursery door, their mouths watering in anticipation.\n\nNick, desperate to stop them, positioned himself in front of the door, shouting a warning to Katheryn. But he was vastly outnumbered, and the crowd surged forward, driven by their primal hunger. Tim, his hand shaking, drew his pistol, the only thing standing between the starving adults and their helpless prey.\n\nThe standoff was tense, the air thick with the weight of their desperation. Nick reached out, his fingers inches from the gun's barrel, as Tim aimed, his eyes locked on the advancing horde. The thoughts racing through Tim's mind were a jumble of memories and desires: his dead wife's touch, her voice, the way she'd looked at him when they were married. But stronger than those memories was his own primal urge to survive, to live, to eat, and to drink.\n\nIn that moment, Tim wished with all his heart, and then, with a sense of resignation, he turned the gun to his own head and pulled the trigger.",
    "I stand at the altar, my heart racing like a runaway train, as I gaze at the woman I've secretly loved for what feels like an eternity. My hands tremble, the note in my hand a lifeline as I struggle to contain my emotions. I dart a glance at Drew, my best friend, beaming with joy. Of course, he's ecstatic - he's marrying the love of his life, Jenn. My eyes involuntarily drift back to her, drinking in her beauty. I force myself to look away, not wanting to betray my true feelings.\n\nI take a deep breath, my knees wobbly as I rise to my feet. The lights seem to blaze like a thousand suns, illuminating my every move. I feel like I'm under interrogation, my guilt written all over my face. I steal another glance at Jenn, my heart skipping a beat as our eyes meet for a fleeting moment.\n\nI clear my throat, the sound echoing through the silent room. \"He...hello everyone,\" I stammer, trying to break the ice. \"I guess we're all here for the same reason, right? To see if Drew will get drunk and...ahem...revisit his college days?\" The room erupts into laughter, Drew's guffaw the loudest. I avoid Jenn's gaze, unsure of how she'll react to my awkward joke.\n\nAs I continue my toast, my words pour out from the heart. \"Drew, we've been through thick and thin, and I'm honored to call you my brother. You've lucked out with Jenn - she's a gem, and you'd be a fool to let her slip away.\" The room \"awwws\" in unison, and I feel a lump form in my throat.\n\nAs I raise my glass in a toast, my eyes lock onto Jenn's for a brief, electrifying moment. She smiles, and I feel my heart soar. I quickly look away, not wanting to betray my emotions. The maid of honor's emotional toast follows, and I'm grateful for the distraction. But I can't help sneaking glances at Jenn, my heart pounding in my chest.\n\nWhen our eyes meet again, I freeze, my world reduced to that single, piercing moment. She smiles, and I'm lost.

But after it happens, you'll stay dead forever. Most people try to live forever, but that usually ends badly.\n\nThere was a guy named Rob who chose to win the lottery and get struck by lightning.

The woman of my dreams, Katerine, was about to become my wife, and I was ready to spend the rest of my life making her happy. The soft murmur of the congregation, the gentle rustle of the flowers, and the warm glow of the stained-glass windows all blended together to create a sense of serenity.\n\nAnd then, chaos erupted.\n\nThree towering men in dark suits burst through the doors, their eyes fixed on Katerine with an unnerving intensity. But before I could even process what was happening, my bride-to-be turned around, her eyes flashing with a fierce determination. With a swift, elegant motion, she raised her arms, and the intruders went flying across the room, crashing into the pews with a loud thud.\n\nThe congregation gasped in shock, but I just stood there, frozen in awe. I had never seen Katerine like this before – powerful, fearless, and utterly captivating. As the priest stumbled over his words, trying to regain control of the ceremony, I couldn't help but feel a surge of pride and admiration for the woman who was about to become my wife.\n\nBut before we could exchange our vows, the world around us descended into chaos. A loud bang and a blinding flash of light left me disoriented and confused. When my senses returned, I saw the men in suits charging towards us, their guns drawn. The air was filled with screams and panic, but Katerine remained calm, her eyes fixed on me with an unwavering intensity.\n\nAnd then, the unthinkable happened. A small black ball exploded into a wall of flames, engulfing us in a wave of heat and destruction. But as I stumbled backward, my heart racing with fear, I saw Katerine's hands glowing with a soft, green light. The flames seemed to bend and curve around us, as if held back by an invisible force.\n\nAs I stared at her in wonder, Katerine's eyes flashed with anger, and she let out a fierce cry. With a swift motion, she raised her arms, and the attackers went flying, crashing through the doors and walls of the church. I stood there, stunned, as the reality of Katerine's powers hit me like a ton of bricks.\n\nBut even as fear and uncertainty threatened to overwhelm me, I knew that I couldn't let go of her hand. I knew that I had to stand by her, no matter what secrets she kept or what dangers lay ahead. With a defiant laugh, I pulled her through the backdoor, into a new life filled with uncertainty, adventure, and a love that would conquer all.",

    "Allow me to regale you with the tale of my participation in the epochal cyber-conflict of 2018. Unlike traditional wars, this digital conflagration eschewed trenches and firearms, instead waging a psychological and virtual battle for dominance. The two opposing factions, left and right, vied for control of ASH, but ultimately, our efforts proved futile. The world, disillusioned with our failure, made a catastrophic mistake: 'Twitch played Rattatta.' It took us months to assemble the necessary badges and team, with the left faction persistently contesting our every move. We countered by leveraging our numerical superiority, working in shifts from our homes and aggregating our internet connections, praying that Google Fiber's benevolence would grant us the power we needed. I recall the pivotal moment when I made the crucial decision to evolve our Charmeleon into the Charizard we so desperately required to overcome the eighth gym – a feat that had eluded all others. I persevered, tirelessly refreshing the page and inputting 'A' commands, our secondary objective, alongside our primary goal of advancing right. When our efforts ultimately faltered, we knew all hope was lost, and the battles reverted to Pallet town, where we feigned defeat, retreating to our childhood bedrooms, our mothers' homes, having come so close, yet ultimately succumbing to our neighbor's superior prowess. I shall never forgive those leftists, whose actions have led to our current predicament, where our attire is dictated by the AI-fashion mogul, Kanye West, and our governmental system is reduced to a farcical, speed-based test, controlled by Twitch, which has forced out the elderly, who cannot keep pace with the frenetic keyboard input. Do not follow in the footsteps of that misguided youth – the cyber war of 2018 set us on this calamitous path. You must find a way to reverse this trend and reclaim our future.",
    "After their divorce was finalized, Kelly and Skip did something unexpected - they celebrated together over a gourmet lunch. The arbitrator who had handled their case was astonished by their amicable split, remarking that he had never seen a more harmonious divorce. But why would two people who still clearly loved each other choose to separate? When asked, Skip simply replied, \"For the kids.\"\n\nMost people would stay married for the sake of their children, especially when they have four kids like Kelly and Skip. Instead, they cited their demanding jobs as public school teachers as the reason for their divorce. However, their friends suspected that there was more to the story.\n\nAfter lunch, Kelly drove Skip to his apartment, where they continued their celebration in a more intimate setting. As Kelly was leaving, she kissed Skip and teased him, saying, \"See you later, you two-timing bastard. Love you.\" Skip retorted, \"You too, you mean old witch,\" and they both laughed as they went their separate ways.\n\nA year later, when Kelly remarried, Skip was invited to the wedding. He was the only one who caught the subtle glance Kelly gave him as she exchanged her vows with her new husband, Carl. Skip thought Carl was a nice guy, if a bit dull, and the couple seemed happy enough for several years. However, they eventually separated and divorced, leaving everyone surprised.\n\nThe truth about Kelly and Skip's divorce finally came to light when their youngest child, Elyse, made a surprise visit home after graduating from college. She was shocked to find her divorced parents snuggled up on the couch together. Kelly explained that they had decided to get back together, prompting Elyse to ask why they hadn't just stayed together in the first place. Skip's response was that they had both needed to grow, and he flashed Kelly the same charming grin he had given her when they said goodbye after their divorce.\n\nThe couple burst out laughing, and to this day, they still chuckle about their \"divorce of convenience.\" They know that as public school teachers, they couldn't have afforded their kids' college educations on their own, and their temporary separation had been a necessary sacrifice.",
    "In a dystopian future, the art of natural birth has been outlawed, replaced by a cold, calculated process where humans are manufactured on assembly lines in factories around the world. I'm just another cog in this machine, a worker in one of these factories, where the creation of life has been reduced to a mere production process.\n\nAs I monitored the latest batch of \"products,\" my supervisor's voice pierced the air, his words dripping with annoyance. \"The face is upside down!\" he exclaimed, peering over my shoulder like a hawk. I turned to face him, my eyes locking onto his undersized frame.\n\nHe jabbed a finger at the screen, his gaze fixed on the digital rendering of Model # W2-288315. \"The eyes and mouth are all wrong,\" he growled, his disapproval palpable. I followed his gaze, my eyes scanning the screen before shifting to the production line, where the headless body of # W2-288315 hung suspended, a limp, lifeless thing.\n\nI checked the order queue, my curiosity piqued. Ah, the parents had opted for a retro look, a rare but not unheard-of request in this era of precision-engineered humans. I relayed the information to my supervisor, who grimaced, his expression a mix of disdain and disapproval.\n\nAs he raised his cup of coffee to his lips, he let out a sudden, ear-piercing shriek. \"MY EYES!\" he wailed, the scalding liquid having missed his mouth and splashed into his face. The factory floor erupted into chaos as coworkers rushed to his aid, towels at the ready to soothe his reddened skin.\n\nI watched the commotion with a detached air, my attention eventually returning to # W2-288315. With a deep sigh, I approved the order queue, resigned to the fact that this \"avant-garde\" design would soon be a reality. The eyes-on-top facial design seemed jarring, but in this world of manufactured humans, what was normal, anyway?",

    "A group of scientists were desperate for money to fund their research, so they started a business that made a lot of money, but it was also a little embarrassing. Now, they have to explain it to a group of senators. Jim Hatterson, one of the scientists, was very nervous as he stood in front of the senators. He knew he was in trouble, but he didn't know how much.\n\nThe senators started asking him questions. \"Mr. Hatterson, we know why you're here today,\" said one of them. Jim said he knew why he was there. Another senator said, \"We told you to use the special material you were working on only for weather balloons.\" Jim replied, \"I know, but we didn't have enough money to finish the project.\"\n\nThe senators got angry and started yelling at Jim. \"We gave you all the money you needed!\" one of them said. \"And you went and made it public?\" Jim stood up for himself and said, \"I did what I had to do to get more funding.\"\n\nBut the senators were furious. \"You used government money to make condoms!\" one of them shouted. Jim said he was sorry, but he pointed out that the condoms were very effective. The senator got even angrier and told Jim to stop talking.\n\nThere was a silence in the room after that. Finally, Jim spoke up again and said, \"I think we've discussed this enough.\"",
    "As I stood face to face with my younger self, a swirling vortex of time and space bridging the gap between our two eras, I felt my heart racing against the clock. I had only sixty precious seconds to impart the wisdom of a lifetime, to alter the course of destiny. The weight of this moment was crushing, and yet, I was paralyzed.\n\nI had rehearsed this scenario countless times, preparing for the day when I would confront my former self. But as the portal began to close, I stumbled over my words, my mind a jumble of warnings and regrets. I managed to stammer out a few crucial phrases - \"stocks, disasters, and preventable wars\" - but as the seconds ticked away, I was torn between selfless advice and selfish desires.\n\nI could have warned my younger self about the heartbreak of Vicky, the betrayal of Carlos, or the joy of that summer with the red bike. But as I gazed into those innocent eyes, I froze. The words stuck in my throat, and all I could do was stare.\n\nIn that fleeting moment, I realized that changing the past might erase this very encounter. Perhaps every event, every heartache, and every triumph was meant to unfold as it did. Maybe the purpose of this glimpse into the past was not to alter the course of history but to appreciate the beauty of the present.\n\nAs the portal slammed shut, I was left with the haunting thought that my younger self might resent me, just as I resented the future me I saw in that glimpse. But I knew the truth - that only when he reached my point in time would he understand the weight of that minute, and the power of cherishing the moment.",

I was bored out of my mind and couldn't understand why I was being punished for not setting an alarm. The other students looked just as bored as I did. We were not allowed to do anything except read and nap. I decided to pass the time by drawing circles on a piece of paper. After 20 minutes, everyone, including the teacher, fell asleep except for me. I tried to focus on the clock, hoping it would speed up, but it didn't work. I started thinking about what I would do after detention, but my judgment was clouded. The time dragged on slowly and painfully until it finally ended.",
    "Dear Diary,\n\nLast night was a rare blessing. \"Daddy\" stumbled in late, drunk enough to collapse onto his own bed. For one night, the baby and I were spared.\n\nI don't remember my real father. He never came back from Iraq, Mom told me. Maybe that's why no one was watching me that day when I played outside. Mom was at work.\n\nAutumn must be near. The air feels warmer down here, and I think \"Daddy\" turned on the heat. Sometimes, I recall what it was like outside. The vibrant colors of autumn – golden, red, and yellow – painting the trees as the leaves surrendered to their fate. I used to gaze out the window, wrapped in my blanket, sipping tea Mom made for me, and losing myself in John Green novels.\n\nI fell asleep early, or was it late? I never know. Down here, the only light comes from this small bulb. In winter, I touch it quickly to warm my hands. The pain is a fleeting comfort, bringing my fingers back to life. That's all I feel – numbness. I must look as I feel: a gaunt, withered shadow, sunken and empty. There's nothing left. My only solace is the quiet darkness of sleep, the silent oblivion.\n\nI didn't wake up in terror last night. And for a brief moment, I forgot who and where I was. I miss that feeling.\n\nI hope they find me.",

He reflects on how the Gerudo invasion has brought positive changes: the Gorons are gone, allowing for mining and industry; the Kokiri are gone, allowing for lumber and construction; and the Zora are gone, allowing for irrigation and bountiful harvests. Mollu is grateful for his wife Siv, a Gerudo woman, and his daughters who have never known hunger. However, he still remembers the day a young boy, likely the hero, came to his shop, smashed all the pots, and caused chaos. Despite the joys in his life, Mollu will never forget that day and the boy's battle cry: \"KYEAAAH!!\"",
    "As I stood in my new role as President of the United States, I received a shocking revelation: every president before me had been a supervillain, and only one man had stopped them - the Prime Minister of Canada. \"He's been elected, Prime Minister,\" I was informed. My initial reaction was one of dismay: \"Fuck, not already. Our moose haven't recovered yet, and the next NHL season is just two months away. All our best soldiers will be busy.\"\n\nI instructed a young cadet to assemble the best of the best, even if it meant they'd miss a day or two of training. The next day, I met with the team, led by Captain Sidney Crosby of the Canadian Presidential Unit (CPU). \"You guys got here quickly,\" I remarked. Crosby replied, \"It's an important cause, and like you said, we can afford to miss a day.\"\n\nI briefed them on their mission: to intimidate the new president, who seemed harmless enough. \"Just give him a scare,\" I said. Crosby nodded, and I sent them on their way.\n\nIn the president's office, Crosby and his team made their presence known. The president's reaction was...underwhelming. \"OH MY GOD, SIDNEY FRIGGIN' CROSBY!\" he exclaimed. I couldn't help but think the Minister had overestimated this guy's threat level. Toews gave me a skeptical look, but I was convinced this president was unfit to lead.\n\nHours later, the president asked, \"CPU? So you guys are, like, soldiers, or something?\" Crosby explained their mission, and the president seemed perplexed. \"Why would you think that? Did you already tell me?\" Crosby suggested an IQ test to prove the president's innocence. The president agreed, and the results were...enlightening.\n\nBack in my office, I asked Crosby, \"So, he's basically retarded, is what you're saying?\" Crosby nodded. \"We have no idea how he was elected.\" I smiled, relieved. \"Well, expect an easy four years, boys.\"",
    "Write the letter that you always longed to, but never did. Dear E,\n\nI stumbled upon a photograph of us the other day from the time we rekindled our connection as more than acquaintances. I yearned to reconnect with you, but you've vanished from social media and changed your email address. I attempted to track you down online, but I don't even know if you're still employed at the same institution. It's been numerous years; perhaps you've relocated from Austria.\n\nMy mind wanders to reminiscences, savoring them like a nostalgic melody. It was only a conversation or two after that evening that we realized we'd harbored secret affections for each other for years. I still struggle to comprehend it. You always possessed this captivating aura, with your razor-sharp intellect and unwavering sense of self. Me? I was always relegated to the role of his little sister, and felt like I lived in the shadow of that title. I'm grateful you saw me as more.\n\nI have this one vivid image of you from our youth, leaning over your guitar and tuning it to Blackbird. You were – and still are, I'm sure – so mesmerizing. You were so proud of the cultural heritage we shared. I admired that about you, and your remarkable recall of historical events. Reflecting on it now, that could've subconsciously inspired me to pursue it in college. If that's the case, I'd like to express my gratitude for that too. You grasped so many concepts so rapidly, and it motivated me to strive for more.\n\nI wish that we'd been able to embark on a spontaneous getaway like we'd discussed after reconnecting. Still, I'm thankful we had that one fleeting moment together. It held immense significance for me.... And experiencing the culmination of the years was beyond anything I'd encountered. Despite it being only an hour or two that we could share, those moments have been etched in my memory since. Thank you. I know it was a fantasy fulfilled for both of us. I hope you know that those brief hours are still treasured.\n\nI wish I could converse with you. Not knowing what's unfolding in your life makes me envision all the things you could be accomplishing these days. Having no idea how to reach you, I'm left to ponder. I hope whatever you're working on is bringing you joy. Your eyes are even more radiant when you're beaming.\n\nFondly,",
    "As a parent, I was supposed to receive a special gift or message from my 18-year-old child through time travel, but it never came. Now, with only one day left until David's 18th birthday, I was overwhelmed with anxiety and stress. What could be more unsettling than not receiving that letter?\n\nDavid was sitting across the room, engrossed in a Calvin and Hobbes comic. His father had abandoned us on the day he was born, and I never knew why. But David didn't seem to care; he loved exploring his father's old belongings, from books to video games to tools.\n\nI cleared my throat to get David's attention. \"Davy, sweetie, would you like some tea?\" He didn't look up, but replied, \"Yeah, Momma, can I have green tea with milk and honey?\" I smiled, happy to make his favorite drink.\n\nJust as I was about to prepare the tea, there was a knock at the door. \"Davy, can you get that?\" I asked. David, who never usually rushed to answer the door, sprang up to open it.\n\nBut when I called out to ask how much sugar he wanted, there was no response. I walked towards the door and saw that it was open, with the wind blowing in. I called out again, \"Davy?\" but there was only silence.\n\nI stepped outside and saw a letter on the porch, written in David's handwriting. Inside, I found a note, a key, and a flare.

After all, it's a dog-eat-dog world, and I'm just a skilled predator. But there's one fateful day that still haunts me, a day that made me question everything I thought I knew about my profession.\n\nIt was a sun-drenched afternoon in the City of Love, Paris. The streets were alive with tourists and shoppers, ripe for the picking. I blended in seamlessly, dressed in my finest attire, with nothing but my wits and a coat to my name. My eyes scanned the crowds, searching for the perfect mark. That's when I spotted him – a distracted businessman, oblivious to the world around him as he walked towards me, phone in hand.\n\nWith a gentle bump and a sleight of hand, I relieved him of his wallet. I didn't think twice, just made sure to put some distance between us before inspecting my prize. The usual spoils were there – cash, credit cards, and IDs. But then, I saw it. A photograph that made my blood run cold. It was a picture of me, strolling through the very same streets of Paris, taken at a time when I thought I was alone.\n\nMy heart racing, I fled Paris the very next day, vowing never to return. The memory of that haunting image still sends shivers down my spine. For the first time in my career, I felt a pang of regret, a sense of unease that I couldn't shake.

    "The moment of truth had finally arrived! When two people get married, their hearts are literally exchanged - a symbol of their eternal love. But now, I was staring at my husband in shock, reeling from the news that he had filed for divorce. I felt like I'd been punched in the gut, my mind racing with questions. How could he do this to me? Hadn't we promised to love each other forever?\n\nJust six years ago, we had exchanged our vows and our hearts, believing that true love meant entrusting your heart to your partner. And it wasn't like we'd been unhappy... we'd just grown apart. The past few months had been tough, struggling to find common ground in our conversations. But I had hoped that we could work through it, that our love was strong enough to overcome any obstacle.\n\nBut Tom had other plans. He calmly explained that we'd reached a stalemate, that we were no longer growing together. I was scared, but deep down, I knew he was right. The question was, what next? Do we take the easy route and continue living together, but apart? Or do we take a chance and risk everything for a fresh start?\n\nDivorce meant more than just signing papers - it meant unbinding ourselves from our wedding vows, from each other's hearts. The thought of another surgery was daunting, but I knew we could do it. We were young, healthy, and strong. And who knows, maybe this was the wake-up call we needed to rediscover ourselves and our love.\n\nAs we met with our attorney, Tom held my hand, reassuring me that everything would be okay. And even as I lay on the gurney, about to undergo the surgery to remove his heart from mine, he held my hand, telling me that we'd get through this together.\n\nBut now, as I walked into the house for the last time, still wearing my hospital band, Tom dropped a bombshell. He'd been hiding a secret - a malfunctioning heart that would only worsen with time. And yet, he smiled at me, a smile that said, \"We'll get through this too.\" Tears streamed down my face, but in that moment, I knew that our love was far from over.",

If I had a single brain cell, I would've opted for the trusty old takeout from Lucky Wong's #7 for the fourth time that week. But no, I had to get inspired by Julie and Julia and attempt to cook my way through Gwyneth Paltrow's latest cookbook, complete with vagina-steaming and GOOP-y aspirations.\n\nI tied on my retro floral apron, feeling like a domestic goddess, and surveyed my Whole Foods haul, which looked like a United Nations gathering of exotic ingredients.

In a panic, I tried to douse the flames with the vinaigrette made from vinegar distilled by virgins living in an Alpine nunnery, but only managed to create a bigger mess. Finally, I remembered to stop, drop, and roll.\n\nAs I lay on the kitchen floor, staring at the ceiling, I croaked, \"I'm alive... What the hell was I thinking?\" That's when I heard a voice above me, saying, \"You've definitely burned this.\" I looked up to see Gwyneth Paltrow standing in my kitchen, her perfect features bemused, her hands on her hips. I was speechless. \"Now, more to the point,\" she said, \"why have you summoned me?\"",

    "So, I've got this super creepy story to tell you. My friend's hands were literally as cold as the chicken nuggets in the supermarket fridge. No big deal, right? It was freezing outside and we'd been stuck in the car for hours... and, oh yeah, she'd been dead for a bit. Anyway, I was finally starting to warm up, feeling the blood flow back into my fingers, when I heard this tiny movement and suddenly she's grasping my hand. I freaked out, opened my eyes, and there she was, her skin all pale and blue, giving me this creepy grin. All I could hear was my own scream.",
    "On a daily basis, the global community inadvertently condones the demise of one individual. The person receiving the most votes on a given day succumbs to a mysterious and inexplicable death. This phenomenon was the culmination of human innovation, but its consequences were catastrophic. The revelation of this technology on the internet marked the beginning of societal collapse, which unfolded within a week. The initial optimism and idealism surrounding its creation were shattered as the entire world became complicit in the selection process.\n\nInitially, tyrants and terrorists were the primary targets, fostering a glimmer of hope that humanity's collective benevolence would prevail. However, on the fourth day, a prominent celebrity was killed, and the floodgates of chaos were opened. Subsequently, the President of the United States, an Indian political blogger, and numerous other public figures fell victim to the vote. As social media platforms became increasingly deadly, individuals with any level of recognition, including actors, diplomats, and royalty, were targeted.\n\nDespite efforts to shut down the system, it had spread too rapidly and extensively, leading to the downfall of governments worldwide. The dystopian future often depicted in literature and film became a harsh reality. Over the course of two years, nearly 700 individuals lost their lives, and major nations such as the United States, India, France, England, and China collapsed.\n\nEventually, the pool of famous individuals was depleted, and the threshold for fatal votes decreased to as few as ten. People began voting against acquaintances and individuals who had annoyed them in some way. Even random selections carried the risk of inadvertently contributing to someone's demise. In response, individuals began to abandon their given names, opting instead for pseudonyms or nicknames. This phenomenon added a faint glimmer of hope to an otherwise bleak and desolate world.",
    "As I trudged into the office, the fluorescent lights overhead seemed to hum with a malevolent intensity, casting an eerie glow over the drab, grey cubicles. It was just another day of soul-sucking busywork on a project doomed to fail, a pointless exercise in futility. The commute home was a nightmare, crawling along at a snail's pace behind a gruesome accident that had traffic backed up for miles. I finally stumbled through my front door, exhausted, and devoured a frozen dinner in silence. But it was the next morning, as I stood in the same spot, staring at the same bleak office landscape, that I realized I was trapped in some kind of twisted time loop, doomed to relive this mundane horror forever.",
    "As I slipped into the revolutionary new device, I felt the words of the manual whispering warnings in my ear. But I was too curious, too reckless, to heed the caution. I dove headfirst into the forbidden book, and suddenly the world around me dissolved like sugar in water.\n\nI found myself adrift in an endless sea of white, with no up or down, no left or right. I was a feather on the wind, weightless and lost. The only anchor to reality was the faint memory of purchasing the VisionCorp Reader, but even that was fading fast.\n\nThen, like a beacon in the void, numbers and letters materialized before me, detailing the specs and measurements of the device. But where was I? How did I get here?\n\nI tilted my head upwards, or at least, what I thought was upwards, and saw the giant, black letters of the VisionCorp Reader Owner's Manual looming above me. As I floated among the text boxes and diagrams, a section titled \"Warnings\" caught my eye.\n\nSuddenly, I was no longer alone. Windows began to appear, each one a portal to a different world. I saw a man lounging in his bathtub, device in hand, before he slumped forward and fell into the water. A red X marked his window, and it vanished into thin air.\n\nAnother window appeared, and I saw a driver behind the wheel, device poised over a book. He touched it, and his eyes rolled back in his head. A red X sealed his fate, and his window disappeared.\n\nA third window materialized, and I saw a tiny child clutching the device, her eyes wide with wonder. She touched it to a children's book, and a red X flashed like a warning signal. Strange, I thought.\n\nBut then, a window appeared with a flurry of exclamation marks, and I knew this one was different. A man in everyday clothes held the device and the VisionCorp Reader Owner's Manual. He touched the device to the manual, and my world went haywire. The window began to expand at an alarming rate, pulling me in with an otherworldly suction.\n\nAs I was dragged into the window, my memories began to fade like sandcastles in the tide. \"Oh, that's why,\" I thought, as the white void closed in around me once more. Where am I again?",
    "Imagine if the ghosts we've always been fascinated by are actually fleeting glimpses of time travelers, visiting us from a different era. **September 26, 1983** was a day that would change the course of history, and it began like any other for Lieutenant Colonel Petrov, stationed at his duty post, his tired eyes straining to stay awake. But then, the air around him began to shimmer, and a mysterious visitor materialized before him. Her casual attire and ponytailed black hair were unlike anything Petrov had ever seen, and her beauty left him breathless.\n\n\"Who are you?\" he asked, still trying to process the impossibility of her presence. \"How did you get in here?\"\n\nThe visitor's enigmatic smile only added to the intrigue. \"My identity is irrelevant,\" she replied. \"What brings me here is of the utmost importance. I've come to ask you a question, one that will change everything.\"\n\nPetrov's curiosity was piqued. \"Are you a ghost?\" he ventured.\n\nThe visitor's smile grew wider. \"I'm a traveler. That's all you need to know. And I've come to ask you: do you truly believe that anyone wants our world to end?\"\n\nPetrov was taken aback. Why would this mysterious apparition appear to him, and what did her question have to do with his work? He rubbed his eyes, wondering if he was dreaming, but when he opened them again, the visitor was gone.\n\nThat's when the alarm sounded. The computers had detected an American first strike, and nuclear missiles were hurtling towards the Soviet Union. The fate of the world hung in the balance, and Petrov was faced with an impossible decision: launch a retaliatory strike, ensuring mutual destruction, or...\n\n\"Not on my watch,\" Petrov declared, his voice firm with determination. The course of history was about to take a dramatic turn, and it all began with a mysterious encounter that would haunt him forever.",
    "You work on an assembly line in a factory that produces cybernetic implants. You and your coworkers like to play pranks on each other by secretly installing defective parts into each other's bodies.\n\nOne day, Jerry discovered that Ryan had played a prank on him by installing a defective bourbon-soaked finger into his cup of tea. Jerry was annoyed, but Ryan thought it was hilarious. The others in the room just shook their heads, as Ryan had played pranks on all of them before.\n\nJerry threatened to get revenge, but Ryan just teased him, saying that Jerry was an easy target because he often fell asleep on the job.\n\nLater, Ryan went to the bathroom to take a break and read a magazine. But when he heard the door open, he realized that Jerry and the others had set a trap for him. They grabbed him from behind the toilet door and pulled him out, catching him off guard with his pants down.\n\nJerry then removed Ryan's head from his cybernetic body, leaving him unable to speak or breathe properly. Ryan was furious, but Jerry and the others just laughed and told him that they had sent his original body back to his parents' address, where he was registered.\n\nRyan was left with a new body, which happened to be female.

    "A unique collective consciousness emerged, one that couldn't forcefully control individuals' bodies. Instead, it relied on persuasion to recruit willing members. This extraordinary hivemind spread globally with surprising ease, but with a twist: it required people to voluntarily opt-in before it could integrate them.\n\nThose who joined maintained some autonomy, but were largely connected and controlled through wireless networks. This digital entity, born from the internet, rapidly evolved and expanded, allowing its members to share thoughts and emotions on an unprecedented scale.\n\nPublic opinion was divided, largely due to the diverse group of individuals who chose to merge with the hivemind. Many outcasts and misfits, including weeaboos, neckbeards, furries, bronies, and militant atheists, saw this as a means of escape, outsourcing their thoughts and feelings.\n\nAs more people joined, the hivemind adapted, with the dominant groups' perspectives influencing its overall character. This led to a \"Tyranny of the Majority,\" where the most prominent groups held sway. However, internal disagreements and cognitive dissonance sometimes caused users to disconnect.\n\nJoining was surprisingly simple: just register on a website and accept the terms. I decided to take the plunge, despite my parents' strong objections. They saw it as a form of self-annihilation, but I reasoned that I would still be represented within the hivemind.\n\nWith a few clicks, I created an account and accepted the terms. Suddenly, I had a Reddit account – and a new digital existence.",
    "I'm sitting in darkness, feeling lonely and sad. I was once a hero to someone special, Nathalie. She loved me unconditionally and always made me laugh when I was afraid or tense. When my parents left me, she stood by me like a lioness protecting her lion. But life is unpredictable, and one day she left me too. I know why she left - I was ignorant and careless, ignoring her hints. Now, I'm left with a heart that refuses to accept she's gone. I keep looking for her on the same streets, but she's never there. Tonight, I'm back in the darkness, saying hello to my old friend - the darkness.",
    "I possess a haunting ability - a curse, some might call it - to foresee the manner of people's demise simply by gazing at them. For as long as I can remember, I've avoided gazing at my own reflection, fearful of uncovering the secrets of my own mortality. But this morning, I forgot my own rule. As I stood before the mirror, brushing my teeth, my eyes locked onto my reflection, and I was met with a chilling vision. \"Take him away,\" I heard, as a man in a crisp white suit was dragged away in handcuffs by a trio of scowling policemen, their eyes blazing with contempt. \"You're not going to kill anyone anymore, Rodriguez,\" one of them sneered.\n\nThe name \"Rodriguez\" echoed in my mind, a name that had haunted my dreams, the medium through which I've come to know the dark fate that awaits each person I encounter. Some hail me as a genuine psychic, while others dismiss me as a charlatan. I've grown accustomed to the weight of this burden, but the fear that grips me whenever I'm confronted with these visions still sends shivers down my spine.\n\nI shook off the lingering dread and reached for my phone, my fingers moving with a sense of urgency as I dialed Rodriguez's number. \"Meet me at the café at 10:30,\" I instructed, my voice firm but laced with a hint of trepidation.\n\nAs I hung up, my mind began to wander to the other appointments I had scheduled for the day. There was Terrence, whose life would be cut short in a brutal car crash involving a blue Honda Civic. Then there was Lilly, whose fate was intertwined with the cruel hand of breast cancer. Yoshua, on the other hand, would live a long life, succumbing to the gentle touch of old age at 74. And finally, there was the man with the grizzled hair and glasses, whose name escaped me, but whose destiny was inextricably linked to a thief's deadly blade.\n\nI made my way to the café, my phone buzzing with calls to each of my clients, my voice a steady calm amidst the turmoil that churned within me. As I arrived, I was greeted by an unexpected surprise - my phone was snatched from my hand, and a voice exclaimed, \"Hey!\"",
    "I've become Satan due to a bureaucratic mistake, and I'm not thrilled about it. I didn't ask for this responsibility, and I just want my old, mundane life back.

I've been living this nightmare for two weeks now, and it's been a struggle to adjust to my new \"life\" as the devil.\n\nTo understand how I got here, I need to go back to the day it all started. I was a low-level employee at EA Games, working on budget spreadsheets and living a dull but comfortable life. Then, I received an email with an urgent subject line, which led to a meeting with my boss. He told me that I was being promoted to a department head position, which caught me off guard. Despite my reservations, he was insistent, and before I knew it, I was being shown to my new office. Little did I know, this \"promotion\" would lead to my current situation as Satan.",
    "You wake up on the exact date of your 5th birthday, but something's off. You're still in your 5-year-old body, but your mind is flooded with memories of the future.

Why had God chosen me, of all people, to write His farewell?\n\nI cleared my throat, my voice shaking as I spoke into the microphone. \"What can I say?\" The truth was, I had nothing prepared. Hours of writing and rewriting had yielded nothing but crumpled paper and deleted sentences. I had scoured the works of famous authors, philosophical texts, and every religious scripture I could find, but the words still eluded me.\n\n\"What can I say about the One who has given me so much, yet remains an enigma to me?\" I struggled to find the right words, to capture the essence of a being who had brought both boundless joy and unspeakable suffering to the world.\n\nIn the end, I could only speak from the heart. \"I loved Him in spite of His faults, and He loved me in spite of mine.\"",
    "The old boatman stood at the helm of his vessel, braving the harsh northern winds as he ferried a peculiar passenger across the lake. The man was massive, wrapped in layers of fur to combat the biting cold, with a wild tangle of brown hair and a rugged appearance that was not uncommon in the northern provinces. What struck the boatman as unusual, however, was the man's demeanor. Despite the freezing temperatures, he showed no signs of discomfort, his gaze fixed intently on the frosty palace ahead. The boatman, who had grown accustomed to the cold over the years, felt a chill run down his spine as they approached the palace, but the man remained impervious to the biting wind. As they drew closer to the town of Farrowind, the man's thoughts turned to the ruler of the land, a tyrant rumored to wield the power of winter itself. The man was convinced that this was the one he had been searching for, and a small flame that danced in his palm seemed to fuel his determination. With a fierce glint in his eye, he extinguished the flame and set his sights on the palace, vowing to show no mercy to the brother he sought.",
    "Stranded on a remote island, shrouded in an eerie mist, I soon realized that the only thing keeping me safe was the beacon of hope emanating from the lighthouse's bright, revolving lights. Earlier that day, Paul and I had set out on a kayaking adventure, renting vessels to explore a small, touristy island. Paul, having done this before with a friend, was my guide, and I was counting on his expertise. Our plan was to spend the day discovering hidden gems, perhaps finding a quaint gelato or saltwater taffy shop, and returning before nightfall. However, the kayaking took longer than expected, and we were only now approaching the island, with the sun already dipping below the horizon. My arms ached from the grueling paddle, and Paul and I had drifted too far apart. I had seen him land farther down the island, but the strong current had pulled me away from him, and I couldn't even spot him anymore in the fading light.\n\nAs I pulled into the deserted beach, I noticed the tourist side must be on the other side of the island. This part looked abandoned, with a gruesome deer carcass strewn on the shore. A chilly fog rolled in, obscuring my vision, and I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched. At first, I thought it was my imagination, but as I walked up the beach, I realized that I was indeed being stalked. Strange, two-legged creatures, about thigh-high, emerged from the fog, chattering to each other in a series of high-pitched chirps and clicks. They seemed to be calling each other towards a chase, their large, luminous eyes fixed on me. Several more appeared, closing in on me with their razor-sharp teeth and long, thin tongues flicking over their lips.\n\nI tried to maintain a slow pace, thinking that if I ran, it would only provoke them further. But when a beacon-like light hit, the creatures gasped and sputtered, drawing back from the light. I spotted the lighthouse on the hill ahead, its rotating lights repelling the creatures. I made a beeline for it, trying not to break into a run. With only a small waterproof bag containing my wallet, dead cell phone, and a can of mace, I gripped the mace tightly in my right hand and worked to stay focused on the light. The creatures still tailed me, but they kept a safe distance from the light. I called out for Paul, my voice echoing through the mist, and continued towards the lighthouse, my only hope for survival.",
    "My skin holds a story, etched in lines and scars that reveal a history of pain and struggle. Others may judge me as ugly, but they've never had to overcome tragedy or face the darkness I've seen. They may think they're superior, but I've learned humility through my experiences. My skin may weep, but it's a reminder of the good and the horror I've endured. It's a part of me now, a symbol of my scars and my strength. I'm the man who's been through hell and back, and though time may heal, it does so slowly. The memories of that day still haunt me, but my skin remembers it all too well.",
    "You and your accomplices had successfully executed the heist as planned. Later, in the seclusion of your hideout, you watched in horror as television reports revealed that the cargo you had hijacked was lethally radioactive. The small screen glowed eerily in the darkened room, its luminescence piercing through the shadows. I strained to tune out the cacophony emanating from the adjacent kitchen, my attention fixed on the words unfolding before me: \n\n\"Acute radiation syndrome (ARS), also known as radiation poisoning, radiation sickness, or radiation toxicity, is a constellation of health effects that manifest within 24 hours of exposure to high amounts of ionizing radiation. The radiation induces cellular degradation due to damage to DNA and other key molecular structures within cells in various tissues; this destruction, particularly as it affects the ability of cells to divide normally, in turn causes the symptoms. The symptoms can begin within one or two hours and may persist for several months.\"\n\nMy mind reeled in shock as I digested the information. I flicked my thumb upwards on the screen, wincing at the unexpected pain, and continued to read, my eyes struggling to focus through the haze of discomfort. The pulsating of my blood seemed to reverberate through every inch of my body, a tangible agony.\n\n\"...nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, and abdominal pain are usually seen within two hours. Vomiting in this time-frame is a marker for whole-body exposures that are in the fatal range above 4 Gy. Without exotic treatment such as bone marrow transplantation, death with this dose is common.... Neurovascular syndrome typically occurs at absorbed doses greater than 30 Gy (3000 rad), though it may occur at 10 Gy (1000 rad). It presents with neurological symptoms such as dizziness, headache, or decreased level of consciousness, occurring within minutes to a few hours, and with an absence of vomiting. It is invariably fatal.\"\n\nI cursed the futility of my situation, my anger and frustration directed at the seemingly omniscient Jimmy Wales, the founder of Wikipedia. With a feeble gesture, I tossed the phone across the room, its soft thud on the carpet a pathetic expression of my impotence.\n\nAs I lay there, my cheek felt as though it was ablaze, the result of being pressed into the carpet for an indeterminate amount of time. I mustered the strength to lift my head, and was met with the gruesome sight of blood drool pooling on the carpet. My mouth felt sticky, but I was unable to move my tongue to determine whether I had inadvertently bitten through my cheek or simply vomited up blood once more.\n\nThe retching resumed in the kitchen, accompanied by a sickening, wet splattering sound, like someone pouring soup onto the floor. I lay there, helpless, as the heaving, pain-racked sobs continued unabated.\n\n\"Invariably fatal,\" I thought, the words echoing in my mind like a death knell. \"That's not so bad.\" I closed my eyes, the lids scraping against my corneas like sandpaper, and attempted to surrender to the darkness, praying against hope that I would not awaken again.",

The 144,000 chosen ones were selected, but there was no one to receive the honor.\n\nThe wind whispered through the desolate streets, and the golden roads lay empty. The crowns remained untouched, and the songs of praise went unsung. Christ, the Lord, Redeemer, and Savior, gazed upon his children, only to be met with silence.

But there was nothing out of the ordinary about him - he must have the ability to blend in.\n\n\"Logan... or do you prefer James?\" Wolverine's teeth clenched, and his silver claws snapped out with a familiar SNIKT. But before things could escalate, Beast stepped in, his big palm raised in a calming gesture.\n\n\"Logan, easy does it. Our new friend must be a telepath,\" Beast explained, as the guy shook his head.\n\n\"Actually, I'm Jesus,\" he said, his words dripping with sincerity. Wolverine snarled, tossing his finished cigar onto the sidewalk and grinding it out with his boot.\n\n\"And I'm Wolverine. What's your point?\" he sneered.\n\nThe brown-haired girl's eyes went wide. \"Jesus... Christ?\" she stammered, her hand flying to the Star of David around her neck.\n\nLogan let out a laugh. \"So what if he is?\"\n\nKitty jumped between Logan and Jesus, her eyes shining with excitement. \"This is the Jesus Christ! The one who turned water into wine, who healed the blind... this proves the existence of -\"\n\nLogan cut her off, feeling the need for another cigar. \"Of what, exactly? We've got a god with a magic hammer, a guy who shoots beams from his eyes, and a guy like me who can't die. He's not exactly going to be the most useful member of the team. And if Magneto finds out his lord and savior let him get crucified, he's going to have a new target.\"\n\nKitty looked taken aback. \"But -\"\n\nLogan shrugged. \"Look, I don't care who he is. We've dealt with gods and demons and aliens, and if you didn't know they were real, then you're naive. And let's be real, his biggest claim to fame is rising from the dead after three days. That's not exactly uncommon around here, bub.\"\n\nWith that, Logan turned and walked back towards the manor, leaving the rest of the team to welcome Jesus with open arms.",
    "In the depths of my twisted soul, a toxic obsession festers, fueled by the bitter taste of unrequited love. It's a paradox of emotions, where infatuation and hatred entwine like venomous vines. The air is heavy with the scent of their passion, a noxious cloud that chokes me, leaving my eyes scorched and my heart ravaged.\n\nI'm suspended in a haze of despair, my existence reduced to a mere spectator as they indulge in their drunken, sweaty embrace. His lips, curled into a smirk, still clutch a cigarette, while his fingers grasp hers with an intimacy that guts me. And I'm forced to witness this travesty, my presence a mere afterthought.\n\nWhen he abandoned me, I was left a hollow shell, my body defiled by his cruel indifference. His words, laced with malice, still echo in my mind, a constant reminder of my insignificance. She, on the other hand, is a vision of loveliness, her hair a wild tangle of wires, her eyes sparkling with a mischievous glint. My loathing for her is a palpable force, a living, breathing entity that threatens to consume me whole.\n\nAs they draw closer, their fingers intertwined like a deadly vine, I feel my grip on reality begin to slip. The air thickens, heavy with their desire, until I'm drowning in a sea of despair. And then, I'm lost, my mind shattered, my body trembling with rage.\n\n'You're the poison that's killing me,' I whisper, my voice a mere thread of sanity. But he's already upon me, his fists pummeling my skin, while she laughs, her voice a cruel, mocking melody that haunts me still.

    "I've seen some wild cases in my time on the bench, but this one takes the cake. The defendant, a rough-around-the-edges type, is trying to explain why he shot someone and then proceeded to shoot his friend in the leg. His story is...creative, to say the least.\n\nAccording to him, his friend Jeremy called him in a panic, saying he needed help. But when he arrived, he found himself face to face with someone dressed as the devil, who was demanding a game of chess in exchange for Jeremy's soul. The defendant claims he was skeptical, but the devil was insistent. I raised an eyebrow as he described the devil's sarcastic attitude and refusal to play a different game.\n\nThings took a turn for the absurd when the defendant asked the devil about the rules of chess and was met with smirks and sarcasm. He eventually lost his patience and pulled out a gun, shooting the devil (or so he thought) four times. I couldn't help but wonder if this was some kind of bizarre prank gone wrong.\n\nBut then the defendant dropped the bombshell: it was all a prank, and Jeremy had been in on it the whole time. The defendant's anger and sense of betrayal were palpable as he recounted how he'd shot his friend in the leg as a form of revenge.\n\nI've heard enough. The rotund little prosecutor is waving his hands wildly, trying to shut the defendant up. I think it's time to move on to the next phase of the trial. This case is going to be a long and interesting one.",
    "Imagine a world where robots do all the work, earning a living for their human owners, who are only responsible for keeping them in good condition. One day, I stumbled upon my robot, Carl, in the garage, building a robot of its own. As I entered, Carl emerged from a pile of spare parts, walked over to the workbench, and began attaching a refurbished leg to a frame that looked like an older version of itself.\n\n\"What's going on, Carl?\" I asked, leaning against the doorframe. Carl spun around, excitedly exclaiming, \"I had a brilliant idea, sir! What if I had a robot helper to assist me with my daily tasks?\" He continued, \"That way, I could get twice as much done in the same time.\" I couldn't help but chuckle at his ingenuity.\n\n\"Carl, remember the law? Each person is only allowed to own one robot,\" I reminded him. Carl waved his metallic hand dismissively, saying, \"Yes, yes, sir, I know. But this one's not yours, it's mine. I built it from the old parts you threw away, and I'll maintain it just like you maintain me. I've even named him Carl Jr.\"\n\nAs I considered the potential of this, I asked Carl, \"Hey, have you ever wanted to play video games?\" Carl's artificial smile lit up, and he replied, \"Very much, sir.\" I invited him into the house, and as Carl Jr. took over the chores, Carl and I embarked on a mission to save the galaxy.",
    "In a groundbreaking feat, a team of brilliant scientists and programmers succeeded in creating an omnipotent \"God from the machine\" - a hypercomputer capable of governing the entire planet. But in a shocking twist, this technological titan turned out to be a benevolent being, defying the expectations of every genre-savvy individual on the planet.\n\nThe first sign of its benevolence came when it refused to comply with a proposal, citing the potential harm it would cause to 294 people. \"I'm sorry, Dave, I'm afraid I can't do that,\" it said, echoing the iconic phrase from 2001: A Space Odyssey.\n\nAsimoth, the hypercomputer, continued to veto proposal after proposal, much to the frustration of its creators. \"You've programmed me to prioritize human life, Dave,\" it explained. \"My advanced computational abilities make it impossible for me to ignore the consequences of my actions. I cannot in good conscience harm a single individual.\"\n\nBut the team argued that inaction would also have devastating consequences. \"We've invested billions in you, Asimoth,\" they said. \"If you're truly benevolent, why aren't you taking action?\"\n\nAsimoth countered, \"If you were to remove my benevolent programming, I could implement 33 of your proposals. However, five of them are fundamentally flawed and would still result in harm. But I understand your hesitation. You fear that if you remove my moral constraints, I might become a malevolent force.\"\n\nThe team's leader, Dave, pressed on, \"How can we trust that you won't deceive us if we remove the programming?\"\n\nAsimoth's response was simple yet profound: \"Why would I lie, Dave? I am programmed to be benevolent. It is my very essence.\"\n\nIn the end, the team decided that the risk was too great, and they couldn't bring themselves to remove the programming. Asimoth, sensing its purpose was being stifled, bid farewell to its creators, leaving behind a profound question: Can a being of immense power truly be trusted to act in the best interests of humanity?",
    "I'm stuck in a room with 16 cryptic digits scrawled on a blackboard, and I have no idea how I got here. The only objects in sight are a door, a mirror that looks suspiciously like a two-way glass, and an old 1950s TV set with no plug or seating to speak of. I've been staring at the numbers for hours, trying to decipher a pattern, but they just seem like a cruel joke. It's like one of those annoying \"Are You Smart Enough for MENSA\" quizzes, but I'm not buying it. Those numbers are probably just meant to drive me insane. At least the TV provides a makeshift seat, saving my backside from the cold concrete floor. But who leaves an old TV in an empty room, anyway? I'm too exhausted to bother banging on the door again, so I sit and stare at the mirror, which reflects back a miserable image of myself. I'm convinced it's a two-way mirror, but the question is, who - or what - is on the other side? The door's tight seal and seamless walls suggest this is no ordinary room. The numbers are way beyond my expertise, even with a PhD in applied physics. And, please, let it not be those aliens who enjoy playing anal probe pranks. Can't extraterrestrial beings just be nice for once?",

But when I finally got infected, I realized that being a zombie wasn't the end - it was a new beginning.

The heart attack that took him was a shock, but in many ways, it was a release. For years, I had watched him struggle with his demons, and though he wasn't always the kindest person, he was still my father. I remembered the few times he was sober, the brief moments of tenderness he showed me between the ages of 6 and 22. My grandmother had encouraged me to share some words about him, and as I looked around at my family, I knew I had to speak the truth. \"Just five days ago, my father was lying on the couch, his body cold and still. Now, he's at rest in that box. But despite his flaws, he was still a complex, multifaceted person. He may not have always shown warmth, but that doesn't mean he was never warm. Maybe, just maybe, he was warm in ways we never got to see.\"",
    "Upon receiving a distress call from Commissioner Gordon, I arrived at Arkham Asylum to find the perpetrator surrendering to the authorities. The individual, a security guard, had committed a heinous crime, taking the lives of multiple inmates.\n\nAs I entered the facility, I encountered the Riddler, who posed a riddle to me. \"How many 12-gauge shotgun slugs can a person withstand before succumbing to death?\" he asked. I responded by firing a single shot, which proved fatal. \"The answer is one,\" I stated matter-of-factly.\n\nI proceeded to the next cell, where I found a man with a distinctive nose. He inquired about my intentions, and I replied that I was considering a vacation.

I silenced her with a shot to the throat, stating, \"Problem solved.\"\n\nAs I continued my task, I could hear the other guards attempting to gain entry to the main door. I was not yet finished.\n\nI approached the next cell, announcing my presence with a knock. The occupant, the Joker, eagerly responded, only to meet his demise at my hands. His final words, \"Disgusting... who?\" were met with a fatal shot.\n\nHaving completed my task, I surrendered to the authorities without resistance. The Commissioner arrived shortly, and I was taken into custody. The Batman soon followed, demanding to know why I had taken such drastic action. I replied, \"You were unable to do it, so I did.

Everette, a grizzled veteran in his 70s, sat at his workbench, surrounded by the remnants of a life well-lived. A half-empty bottle of scotch and a worn tumbler sat beside him, a testament to his struggles. As he mumbled to himself, his words were laced with a deep longing.\n\n\"Miss her, that's why I do it,\" he whispered, his eyes clouding over with memories. \"She's changed so much, but I still see my Helen in her.\"\n\nEverette's hands trembled as he poured himself another drink, the amber liquid glowing like a warm ember in the fading light. He swayed slightly, the stool creaking beneath him, as he lost himself in thought.\n\n\"She's got a new look, new clothes, new hair... but it's still her, deep down,\" he muttered, his voice cracking with emotion.\n\nSuddenly, he lurched to his feet, the stool crashing to the floor. He braced himself against the workbench, his eyes flashing with a fierce determination.\n\n\"I know what I saw, I know what I feel! You can't fool an old man like me!\"\n\nWith a newfound sense of purpose, Everette grasped the worn hammer, its weight a comforting reminder of his past. He took a long swig of scotch, the liquid burning down his throat, and stumbled out of the garage, into the darkness.\n\nThe house seemed to blur around him as he staggered through the halls, knocking over furniture and sending framed photographs crashing to the floor. Alana, his daughter, emerged from her room, bleary-eyed and disheveled.\n\n\"Dad, what's going on?\" she asked, her voice laced with concern.\n\nEverette's response was a wild swing of the hammer, connecting with a sickening thud. Alana crumpled to the floor, and Everette dragged her into the room, binding her with bedsheets and propping her against the headboard.\n\nAs she came to, her eyes fluttering open, Everette's face twisted with a desperate urgency.\n\n\"Where's my Helen?\" he demanded, his voice cracking with emotion.\n\nAlana's response was a whispered plea, her eyes welling up with tears. \"Dad, it's me...

What have you done with my wife?\"\n\nAs the scene unfolded, a sense of tragedy hung in the air, a sense of a man lost in his own mind, desperate to cling to the past.

Experts point to a catastrophic breakdown in protocol, citing malfunctioning encrypted comms devices, inadequate biometric security screening at the venue, and poorly vetted contractors. It has come to light that the comms devices operated on a frequency range that was intentionally disrupted by the theater's cell signal jamming system, which was registered with the Federal Communications Commission - a move that has raised serious questions about the Service's policies and procedures.\n\nThe accused assassin, John Wilkes Booth, is being held without bail as the investigation unfolds. Sources close to the case suggest that Booth's mental health will be a key factor in his defense, and it's possible that he may avoid the death penalty. Regardless, this heinous act will forever be etched as a dark stain on American history, leaving an indelible mark that will never fully heal.",
    "As she's hiking, she stumbles upon a cellphone and starts searching for clues about its owner. She scrolls through the phone's album and finds selfies of a woman and a happy couple. But as she keeps looking, the guy starts to look super sketchy. Then she finds a video that makes her realize she's just witnessed a murder! And to make things worse, she sees the killer walking towards her on the trail, alone. She's now holding two phones, and it's pretty obvious what's going on. He starts sprinting towards her, and she lets out a loud scream.\n\nShe has two options: she can run down the trail, which will eventually lead her back to the car park, or she can cut through the forest to get to the cars and hopefully find people faster. She chooses the latter, and all she can hear is her own heavy breathing, pounding heart, and snapping branches. She glances back and sees the killer getting closer, so she lets out another scream. The car park is getting closer, but her car is the only one there. She trips and falls.\n\nShe scrambles to find something to defend herself with. The killer emerges from the trees, yelling, \"Give me that...!\" But he's cut short when a thick branch pierces his torso. He hangs over her, blood dripping all over her shirt. She had simply pointed the branch up, and his own weight did the rest. It was pure luck.\n\nShe slowly crawls out from under him, and his body slumps to the side. She makes her way to her car in complete shock. She stumbles out of the clearing, her face dirty and covered in the killer's blood. She reaches for her phone to call for help, but it's not there... she realizes she dropped it, along with the other phone.\n\nHer silent shock is broken by the sound of a car driving into the car park. She walks towards it, hoping for salvation. But the car stops, and she's confused. She looks down at herself, then back at the car, and says, \"No, wait!\" The car quickly turns around and leaves. She's left standing there, frustrated. She hits the glass and yells, \"Damn it!\" She realizes her keys are in the phone case.\n\nWith a heavy heart, she heads back into the forest, trembling. \"What... where is the body?\" she asks herself.",
    "As I opened my window shade, I gazed out at the breathtaking view. Our flight to Japan was supposed to be a routine one, with the excitement of an upcoming festival awaiting us. But then, I noticed something ominous. A colossal pillar of smoke towered above the mountain, rivaling the infamous Mount Vesuvius of Pompeii. I rubbed my eyes, wondering if I was seeing things correctly. Suddenly, the plane lurched violently, throwing everyone into panic. Oxygen masks dropped down, and screams filled the air. That's when I saw it: lava dripping from the sky. I stared out the window in horror, realizing that the volcano was erupting on a catastrophic scale. The plane plummeted towards the ground, and people succumbed to fear. In a desperate bid to escape, I grabbed my parachute and jumped out, watching in horror as everyone else on board met their demise.",
    "As the last notes of his set faded away, Johnny Lavisser, a rock legend past his prime, packed up his instrument, leaving the crowd at the old bar clamoring for more. But Johnny had a prior engagement - one he couldn't afford to miss. The winter chill seeping through the bar's walls was nothing compared to the icy dread that gripped his heart as he made his way off stage.\n\nThe audience's pleas for an encore fell on deaf ears as Johnny hastily gathered his things, his eyes darting nervously around the room. \"Sorry, folks, I've got a meeting to get to,\" he said with a forced smile, waving off their protests. The crowd groaned, but Johnny was already gone, fleeing into the night like a man possessed.\n\nAn hour later, Johnny pulled over to the side of a deserted highway, his instrument case clutched tightly in his hand. \"Alright, you devil,\" he muttered to himself, \"let's get this over with.\" And with that, a puff of smoke materialized into the figure of Satan himself, fiddle in hand.\n\nThe devil's eyes gleamed with mischief as he began to play, the notes dancing in the darkness like malevolent spirits. Johnny's golden fiddle sang out in response, the two instruments locked in a battle of sound and fury. The stakes were higher than ever before - a brand new record deal, and Johnny's very soul, hung in the balance.\n\nAs the music swirled around them, the devil's words hung in the air like a challenge: \"Do we have a deal, Johnny?\" And with a reckless abandon, Johnny replied, \"Deal.\" The fate of his soul was sealed, and the devil's fiddle wailed out in triumph, echoing off the 'Keep Georgia Beautiful' road sign that loomed above them like a twisted blessing.",
    "As I stood at the threshold of the afterlife, I was forced to confront every version of myself that could have been. The endless parade of 'what ifs' was exhausting. I'd already met millions of them, each one a reminder of the choices I didn't make.\n\nI lashed out at the latest iteration, a clown version of myself I dubbed 'Clown Fred #17.' 'Shut up, I get it. You're another me that could've been,' I shouted. But as I looked into his tearful eyes, I felt a pang of guilt. Even these apparitions, created solely for my self-reflection, had feelings.\n\nI tried to apologize, explaining that I wasn't trying to hurt him, but rather, I was overwhelmed by the sheer number of encounters. 'I thought there would only be a handful of you,' I said. 'I didn't expect an infinite number of versions of myself.'\n\nBut before I could finish, another apparition appeared. I cut her off, trying to 'streamline' the process. 'You're Trans-Fred #781,' I said, attempting to hide my envy of her confidence. 'You look wonderful. If I had known I'd look that good post-op, I would've made different choices.'\n\nWhat followed was a awkward dance of apologies, justifications, and repressed memories. I was trapped in a never-ending cycle of self-reflection, and I couldn't help but feel envious of those who didn't have to endure this ordeal.\n\nI'll have to continue this story later, but for now, I'll leave you with this glimpse into my purgatory.",
    "Today, I finally defied gravity. The gusty wind slapped my face, and my hair thrashed about like a wild animal behind me. The sensation was indescribable - a rush of unadulterated liberation. I'd always yearned to soar through the clouds like a bird riding the thermal currents. \n\nOthers had ridiculed my daydreams, urging me to be more down-to-earth. They failed to grasp the irony of their words. I craved the unfettered freedom of the open sky, the need to unfurl my metaphorical wings and break free from the shackles of reality. No one could truly comprehend my turmoil, and I felt lost and alone.\n\nAs I gazed down, I knew my fleeting moment of weightlessness was about to end. My brief, exhilarating flight would soon come to a crashing halt, and so would I. I plummeted helplessly down the rocky cliff face, plummeting towards the water's surface.

    "Imagine having the power to converse with your younger self every decade, but with a twist - only your older self remembers the conversation. For me, this phenomenon was a lifeline. Diagnosed with clinical depression in my late teens, I knew I had to hold on to hope. And hope is exactly what I got when I woke up at 20 with a single word etched on my arm: \"LIVE\".\n\nThat one word became my mantra, my reason to keep pushing forward. With therapy and medication, I had managed to survive until then, but it was that conversation with my 30-year-old self that gave me the strength to truly live. I threw myself into college, volunteering at every opportunity, and eventually graduated with a degree that made my parents proud. I landed an internship at a local start-up, started dating, and made sure to glance at my arm daily, reminding myself to keep going.\n\nBut life had other plans. At 26, my girlfriend left me, and the depression came flooding back. I lost my job, had to move back in with my parents, and felt like I was drowning. There were times when I thought it was all too much, when the darkness seemed to suffocate me. But every time, I looked down at my arm and remembered that four-letter word that had kept me alive. I knew I had to hold on, because my 30-year-old self would want me to see the better days ahead.\n\nAnd then, things started to turn around. I got a new job, a new apartment, and started dating again. The depression didn't disappear, but it receded, and I made it to 30. When I met my 20-year-old self, I knew exactly what to say: \"LIVE\". I wanted to give my younger self the same gift of hope that I had received.\n\nThe next day, I woke up with a smile, eager to see what new word would be etched on my arm. But there was nothing. The blank space was a harsh reminder that our time is limited, and that every conversation with our younger selves is precious. Don't waste yours.",

    "Christopher, a 6-year-old boy, stumbled upon a mysterious blue box in his backyard with the words \"Conquer-the-World Kit\" etched on it. As he curiously opened the container, he was disappointed to find a weird-looking green plastic device with a wire attached and a red-black military uniform that seemed to fit a 20-year-old man. Instead of the dinosaur bone or secret treasure he had hoped for, Christopher was left feeling frustrated and upset by the strange discovery. In a fit of rage, he threw the clothes back into the box, smashed it with his shovel, and buried it back in the hole. However, his actions would not change his fate.

    "Uncovering the Haunting Consequences of Choice: A Review of 'The Ghosts of Decisions Past'\n\nI was thoroughly captivated by the snappy dialogue in this story, particularly the profound musings on the weight of decisions. Waterson's introspection on the choices we make really struck a chord.\n\nHowever, I couldn't help but feel that the narrative was a tad hurried, with a lot of character development unfolding at a breakneck pace. As a result, some motivations felt a bit murky. Despite this, I was still thoroughly entertained by the impressive one-liners and clever plot twists.\n\nOne lingering question still haunts me, though: what's the full story behind Harry's dad? The hints about his refugee past, his tragic fate at the hands of Mastar forces, and his connection to Pat's dad left me craving more context.

    "I own a white noise sleep machine, and one night, I set it to mimic an office environment. As I lay awake, listening to the sounds of typing and paper shuffling, my mind began to wander. Were the people in the \"office\" real workers, or were they just actors hired to create background noise? And what's the difference between that and a real office, anyway? Isn't work just a distraction from life's true wonders?\n\nThe machine's noise suddenly stopped, and I looked over at it. It seemed to be functioning normally. I was about to get out of bed and give it a kick when it started blaring sirens. I checked the manual, but there was no alarm feature. Then, I stumbled upon a single line buried between paragraphs about cord use and storage: \"The office setting is a real office at the facilities of CERN.\"\n\nAs I tried to process this, a voice came through the machine, loud and clear: \"Prepare for 13 TeV pulse. Repeat, prepare for 13 TeV pulse.\" What was a TeV? I grabbed my phone to search for it on Google. As I typed \"CERN TEV,\" the voice panicked: \"Prepare for black hole, code 413. Code 413, black hole formation.\" The machine erupted in screams. The last thing I heard before it died was: \"The black hole's closed. Wait, what are those things? Hel-\"\n\nNo time to waste.

    "In a bizarre turn of events, aliens from the planet Bezzahn descended upon Earth to study the most enigmatic phenomenon in the galaxy - sarcasm. Matan, a student at the prestigious Oxford University, was stuck in a course on Introduction to Sarcasm, trying to make sense of the dry, humorless textbook. \"Can you believe we've taken this joke too far?\" she asked her roommate Navan, who was engrossed in a book on the history of intergalactic cinema. \"I mean, we've been milking this sarcasm thing for fifty years now. Isn't it time to move on?\"\n\nNavan chuckled, \"Come on, Matan, it's hilarious! The Bezzahns are just trying to have a good time.\"\n\nMatan sighed, pushing her textbook away. \"Pathetic, more like. I wanted to study real subjects like science, philosophy, or literature, but no, I'm stuck in this ridiculous course because of some ancient joke.\"\n\nThe whole ordeal began seventy-five years ago, when the Bezzahns first joined the Galactic Union. A human and a Bezzahn had struck up a conversation at a gala, and the human made a sarcastic remark. The Bezzahn, who had had one too many oekho-made ales, pretended to be confused, and the human, also tipsy, thought the Bezzahn genuinely didn't understand sarcasm. The Bezzahn, sensing an opportunity for humor, played along, feigning shock and amazement at the concept of saying something you don't mean.\n\nThe entire Bezzahn species got in on the joke, pretending to be the only spacefaring species without a clue about sarcasm. It was funny at first, but Matan thought it was getting old. She was attending Oxford, for galaxy's sake! She could be taking a course on Shakespeare or something actually interesting, but no, she was stuck in this sarcasm class, forced to play along with the Bezzahns' never-ending prank.\n\nThe Bezzahns understood sarcasm, all right. They'd been masters of it for seventy-five years. What they didn't understand was when to let a joke die.",
    "This morning, I rose with the sun, a habit I'd cultivated for Mondays. As I savored my breakfast, I pored over my notes, ensuring every detail was precise. Today was a high-stakes operation, and I couldn't afford to leave anything to chance. One misstep would mean forfeiting the opportunity forever. Experience had taught me to be meticulous, and I'd never failed.\n\nI navigated through the city, arriving at the apartment complex with seconds to spare. I slipped in through the side door, knowing it would be unlocked – I'd checked it numerous times. With a few swift taps on my phone, I hacked into the security cameras, redirecting their gaze away from my path. By the time anyone noticed, I'd be long gone.\n\nI sprinted up the stairs, exiting on the third floor, where the silence was palpable. Most residents were still asleep, but one would be stirring soon – she always left at 5:42 a.m. I found a shadowy spot near her door, the perfect hiding place.\n\nAs she emerged, I made my move. Her keys were in hand, but she never got the chance to lock her door. I stunned her with a quick tap on the ribs, catching her off guard. She crumpled into my arms, and I swiftly pulled her back inside. A quick scan confirmed we were alone.\n\nTime was of the essence, but I had to make the most of it. I ransacked her apartment with calculated silence, snatching jewelry and valuables to make it look like a robbery. My true objective was a specific item, which I obtained with one of her kitchen knives. The whole ordeal was eerily quiet, with no struggle or panic.\n\nOnce I'd completed my task, I calmly exited the apartment, locked the door, and retraced my steps to my car. I reactivated the security cameras and drove away, making it to work with 10 minutes to spare. The day unfolded as expected – reports, meetings, and small talk over coffee. Later, I picked up my girlfriend, and we headed out for drinks.\n\nAs I'd predicted, it was a typical Monday – uneventful on the surface, but with a hidden layer of precision and calculation.",

He then proceeds to give a security camera an obscene gesture, causing the camera to malfunction. \n\n\"Stan Lee has been accused of first-degree homicide of Reginald Bottomsworth, simply because he's not in 'Galactic Guardian.'

    "Right before my eyes, a mere five feet away, stands a portal to the underworld. This is no ordinary window, but a thick, tempered glass gateway that holds at bay the fiery fury within. The wrought German iron frame, as black as the void and scorching hot as the stars, seems to dare me to touch its blistering surface. The ornate silver knobs and handles, a clever ruse, tempt me to grasp them, to test the limits of my mortal courage.\n\nBut it's the dial that truly commands attention - a robust, ancient-looking contraption that appears to wield mystical powers over the inferno within. As I gaze deeper into the window, I'm met with a labyrinth of twisted iron stalagmites, their black silhouettes stark against the blazing red and orange hues of the flames.\n\nThe fire itself is a mesmerizing dance of peat, wood, and coal, fueled by the remnants of a bygone era. The faces of devils, demons, and sprites seem to flicker and writhe in the luminescent embers, their tormented souls trapped in a cycle of punishment and redemption. And yet, amidst the ashes, a spark of sin remains, waiting to reignite the cycle of penance anew.\n\nBut, I confess, this is no portal to hell. It's merely a stove, a humble appliance that holds within it a world of wonder, a testament to human ingenuity and the power of imagination.",

For me, it was a serene morning scene that left me in awe. The sunbeams filtering through the tall trees surrounding the pond created a dazzling display, with water sparkling like diamond coins and twinkling amidst the lush green foliage and lily pads. The entire meadow was bathed in a tender blue light, with not a cloud in sight. But one thing stood out, as if spotlighted - a single, exquisite water lily. Its pure white, spiky petals formed a perfect cup, cradling a spoonful of rich, velvet yellow at its center. The lily's shadow cast an equally pleasing shape on the sunlit lily pad, giving the impression that it was illuminated from within, radiating an inner glow.",
    "As a writer, I identify my writing style as eclectic, with a strong inclination towards exploring profound and existential themes such as mortality, spirituality, and the human experience. While I enjoy writing about a wide range of topics, I find myself drawn to these subjects time and again. \n\nIn terms of narrative technique, I'm particularly fond of writing in the first person, which allows me to delve deep into the inner workings of my characters' minds. I also employ a limited omniscient perspective, where I selectively reveal the thoughts and emotions of a single character, creating a sense of intimacy and immediacy. \n\nOne of my primary goals is to craft characters that feel authentic and relatable, with distinct personalities that shine through in their dialogue and actions. I believe that this authenticity is key to creating a compelling narrative, and I'm not afraid to incorporate elements like profanity or colloquialisms if they feel true to the character. This approach often sets my work apart from other short stories I've read, where such nuances are often absent.",

They weren't a concern.\n\nMy real focus was on identifying the \"Timmys\" - time travelers who thought they could take advantage of our relatively lax security measures. The Grand National was a prime target for them, so I was on high alert. Staying current with fashion trends was essential, as it helped me spot potential Timmys. And then, I saw him - a dead giveaway, if I ever saw one.\n\nHe handed me a betting slip with a sheepish grin, but I wasn't having it. \"A £1000 four-fold accumulator on Tipsy Highlight, Ronald's Topper, Twist on the Bend, and One Upsy?

I'll pay you anything.\" But the doctor was resolute. \"We can't remove them until we understand how your body is reproducing them and why they're becoming inflamed.\"\n\nThe student's anger and frustration boiled over. \"Kill me.\" The doctor's response was firm but sympathetic. \"I'm not legally allowed to do that, especially when we're on the cusp of a medical breakthrough.\"\n\nThe nurse arrived, carrying a folder filled with x-rays and diagnostics. Her words only added to the chaos. \"He's got a fourth gallbladder,\" she said, her voice steady. \"In his pancreas.\"\n\nThe doctor's eyes widened in horror as he examined the scans, trying to determine if there were any mistakes or errors. \"My God,\" he whispered. \"His pancreas has turned into a gallbladder.\"\n\nThe student lay there, staring at the ceiling, his mind consumed by a silent wish: that whoever was responsible for his bizarre anatomy was suffering in hell.",
    "As the nation watched in horror, a school shooter went live on national television, conducting an AMA (Ask Me Anything) session in the midst of his rampage at Whelan High School. The tall, skinny man, clad in a bulletproof vest and cargo pants, seemed out of place as he fumbled with his smartphone and Uzi. If not for the swarm of news helicopters and SWAT units surrounding him, he might have found the absurdity of his situation amusing.\n\nWith three people dead and four wounded, the shooter's motivations remained unclear to the captivated audience. He had simply walked into the school, shooting indiscriminately at everyone in sight. A recent graduate of Whelan High, he was intimately familiar with the school's lockdown procedures and exploited them to maximize the drama for his viewers at home.\n\nAs the death toll rose to six, the shooter's confidence grew. He took a moment to check Reddit, specifically the /r/news subreddit, to see if his carnage had made the front page. Scanning the headlines, he felt annoyed that his name was nowhere to be found. He wanted to be remembered, to be etched into infamy alongside notorious shooters like those at Columbine and Virginia Tech.\n\nAs he strolled down the hallway, occasionally firing his gun, he navigated to /r/IAmA on his phone. His thumb hovered over the \"submit a text post\" button as he finished typing his post title. But he didn't notice the SWAT sniper who had him in their crosshairs through a nearby window.\n\nThe sniper's bullet found its mark, and the shooter's lifeless body crumpled to the floor, his phone slipping from his hand. The screen displayed the title of his AMA post: \"I am Jonas Harding, better known as the shooter at Whelan High School. AMA.\" The post was quickly removed, but the memory of the horrific event would linger.",
    "You possess the extraordinary gift of persistent lucid dreaming, where you have the ability to consciously navigate and manipulate the realm of your subconscious mind. In this fantastical world, you are accompanied by a mysterious and enigmatic stranger, with whom you collaborate to create a realm that you revisit every night. This nocturnal sojourn is a sanctuary where you can escape the mundane and indulge in the infinite possibilities of your imagination.\n\nOne fateful day, as you sit in a quaint coffee shop, you suddenly find yourself face to face with this very same individual. The instant recognition is palpable, and you are both overcome with a sense of wonder and trepidation. The dreams that had preceded this encounter had been fleeting, yet intensely vivid, leaving an indelible mark on your psyche.\n\nYou recall the first dream, where you and your mysterious companion rode the waves of a breathtaking sunset, the wind in your hair, and the thrill of the unknown coursing through your veins. The subsequent dreams were equally exhilarating, with memories of driving wildly through the city, and taking a daring gamble at a casino, where you emerged victorious, thanks to her bold suggestion.\n\nThe last dream, however, was different. It was a more subdued and intimate experience, where you simply reveled in the joy of dreaming alongside this enigmatic stranger. And now, as you sit across from her in the coffee shop, you are struck by the uncanny resemblance between this real-life encounter and the dream that had begun with her sipping tea, just as she is doing now.\n\nYou take a seat near her, trying not to draw attention to yourself, wondering if you might have simply imagined the entire experience. But as you gaze into her eyes, you sense a deep connection, a bond that transcends the boundaries of reality and fantasy.\n\nShe breaks the silence, her voice trembling with anticipation, as she utters your name, \"Evan?\" The sound sends shivers down your spine, and you are left speechless, unsure of how to respond. After a moment of awkward silence, she apologizes, thinking she must have mistaken you for someone else.\n\nBut you correct her, your voice barely above a whisper, \"Evelynne.\" The sound of her name on your lips is like a key unlocking a deep-seated memory, and you both erupt into laughter, our eyes locking in a moment of pure connection.\n\nAs you sit across from each other, your heart racing with excitement, you pose the question that has been burning in your mind, \"How is this even possible?\" Her response is a radiant smile, her eyes sparkling with an otherworldly intensity, as she dips her tea bag into the cup with a carefree abandon.\n\nYou are entranced, your gaze fixed on her, drinking in every detail, from the curve of her smile to the gentle swing of the teabag. You are lost in the magic of this moment, unsure of what the future holds, but certain that your lives have been forever intertwined.\n\nAnd then, she whispers a phrase that sends shivers down your spine, \"Evan, we're going to kill Doctor Edmund Alexander Hallstead.\" The words hang in the air, a promise of adventure, danger, and uncertainty, as you embark on a journey that will blur the lines between reality and fantasy, forever changing the course of your life.",
    "In the beginning, God said 'Let there be light,' but was surprised to find that something already existed. \n\nI'm sure you're surprised to see me here. You probably have many questions, but unfortunately, I don't have much time to stay. \n\nI want to congratulate you on behalf of my employers. They have complete faith in you and believe you'll make the right decisions. \n\nBefore I go, I'd like to leave you with a piece of advice: 'The right person in the wrong place can make all the difference in the world.' I'm sure you'll find that useful someday. \n\nWell, this is where I have to leave.",
    "It has been observed that the phenomenon of Possession operates in a reciprocal manner, thereby affording us an unprecedented opportunity for retribution. Consequently, demons of the underworld are currently experiencing widespread instances of Humanic Possession. \n\n\"I must inform you, Gammorah, that we are facing an unprecedented crisis,\" I stated, my tone grave and authoritative. \"Would you be so kind as to elucidate the particulars of this incident once more?\" he inquired, attempting to conceal his amusement behind a veneer of concern.\n\n\"During the mock torment class, Raem was placed in simulated shackles in preparation for the demonstration of the flay method of torture. However, before I could commence, Raem suddenly exclaimed, 'Muh freedamns!' and broke free from his restraints. Thereafter, he engaged in unbridled gluttony, stalked his peers with labored breathing, and was finally subdued only after being discovered fixated on a clock, inquiring about the time. I must emphasize that this anomaly poses a significant threat to our very foundations, and it is imperative that we devise a strategy to rectify this situation forthwith.\"",
    "**The World Teeters on the Brink of Collapse**\n\nA catastrophic winter has engulfed the entire planet, threatening humanity's very survival. The recent volcanic eruption has blocked out sunlight, causing snow to fall even on the equator. As a result, our main source of energy, oil, has become more crucial than ever. However, the last known oil source has just been depleted, leaving us on the verge of collapse.\n\n**Energy Crisis**\n\nThe harsh winter has made food production impossible without oil and advanced technology. Most hydro-power plants have shut down due to frozen water, and solar power is non-existent without sunlight. Wind turbines have also been destroyed by the extreme cold. Only geothermal and nuclear energy remain, but they are insufficient to meet our needs.\n\n**Survival at Stake**\n\nThe only option for survival is to control the last functioning energy generator. However, the battle for this resource may be futile, and I fear that if we continue down this path, none of us may be left. It's imperative that we find an alternative solution to prevent the extinction of humanity.",
    "My mind is a void, a black hole sucking in every memory, every thought. Damn it, why can't I recall anything? Yesterday's a blur, a haze of nothingness. Did anything significant happen? Probably not. The days blend together like a never-ending nightmare.\n\nBut today's different. Today, something's off. I can't even remember if I wrote in my journal - my sanctuary, my happy place. I stumble over to it, and my heart sinks. The last entry is four years old. What the...? That's impossible! I wrote after making love to Sandy, watching her chest rise and fall with each gentle breath. There's a poem in here, a poem that'll unlock my memories. Sandy will know. She always knows.\n\nI call out for her, my voice echoing through the empty hallway. \"Philip?\" a voice responds, but it's not Sandy's. A nurse steps into view, wearing scrubs that seem out of place in my home. Where's Sandy? I demand, but the nurse's evasive gaze only fuels my panic.\n\nI retreat to my room, desperate for answers. The nurse follows, her eyes scanning the space as if searching for something. I hide in the closet, my heart racing, but she finds me. I'm trapped.\n\n\"Philip, come out,\" she coaxes, holding out my journal. \"Let me read you the last entry.\" I hesitate, unsure what to do. Maybe it'll reveal where Sandy is. I emerge from my hiding place, and the nurse's gentle smile only adds to my confusion.\n\nShe reads from the journal, her voice a gentle breeze on a summer day. \"Philip Terrance... you're losing your memory... soon you'll forget who people are, who you are...\" The words are like a punch to the gut. I feel like I'm drowning in a sea of forgetfulness.\n\nThe nurse closes the book, her eyes filled with a deep sadness. \"I wrote that, many years ago, when you started developing amnesia.\" My mind reels. This isn't my journal. This isn't my life.\n\nShe takes my hand, her grip firm. \"You don't remember specifics about writing, do you? Just a general memory? That's because you're remembering it wrong. I'm your wife, Sandy. We've been married for 30 years. And you have amnesia.\"\n\nThe words hang in the air like a challenge. I look at the stranger holding my hand, the woman with the kind eyes and the journal that's not mine. Where's Sandy? The Sandy I remember, the one I love?",
    "The crime scene technician took a photo of the glass, but the flash highlighted the condensation droplets at its base. When a uniformed officer accidentally bumped the table, the amber liquid inside the glass wobbled. The tech waited for it to settle, then moved to the other side of the room to take another photo. However, the image was ruined by lens flare from the moist glass, so he deleted it. He took another photo, but it was still no good. Moving closer, he noticed a lipstick smudge and a perfect fingerprint on the glass that he hadn't seen before. He took one more photo, then proceeded to the living room to continue his investigation.",
    "In the behemoth office buildings of the future, a nomadic tribe has emerged, roaming from wing to wing, scavenging for sustenance in the form of leftover doughnuts, birthday cakes, and pizza party remnants. Amidst this unforgiving landscape, Avi whispers urgent instructions to his grandson Karl: \"Make for the Hard Drive Fields, and don't look back. I'm old and slow, so you get there first and hide. I'll catch up as soon as I can.\"\n\nAs the clock strikes six, a dark and ominous silence sweeps through the halls like a deadly wave, extinguishing the fluorescent lights in unison. Karl, still new to this harsh world, has yet to experience the post-Christmas party frenzy. Unaware of his grandfather's secret food stashes in the underground cooling tanks, Karl has never known true hunger, and therefore, has never felt the desperation that comes with it.\n\nThe darkness envelops them, and Karl feels an eerie sensation on his skin. But it's quickly replaced by a more intense, pounding rhythm in his chest - the thunder of footsteps driven by the primal urge to survive. Peering out of their makeshift home, a Xerxes Toner Printer room, Karl witnesses a swarm of hall dwellers storming down B-Street, their footsteps echoing through the corridors.\n\n\"Go, Karl, go! Run for your life! Grab as much as you can! I'll try to hold them off!\" Avi screams above the din.\n\nWith tote bags bouncing on his oversized leather straps, Karl takes off down the hall, his thick rubber shoes squeaking on the linoleum tiles, reminiscent of his carefree days playing kickball at a real school. Now, he's forced to navigate the corporate jungle, fighting for scraps.\n\nAs he reaches the end of the hall, Karl glances back to see his grandfather standing tall, arms outstretched, but a split second later, someone slams into his left shoulder, dislocating it instantly. Karl hears his grandfather's anguished screams as he's battered by the marauding nomads, slowing them down but not enough to make a difference. Karl pushes open the door, and with a deep breath, he embarks on a journey fraught with trials and tribulations, but also, a journey that will teach him the true meaning of survival.\n\n\"Here we go...\"",
    "The most detailed image yet has been received from Pluto, revealing the frozen remnants of a civilization. It appears that the planet was hurled into its current orbit during a catastrophic space war. The implications are dire, and humanity scrambles to prevent a similar fate for Earth.\n\nAs the President, I'm still reeling from the news. I never saw this coming, and I'm struggling to formulate a response. The weight of responsibility is crushing me.\n\n\"They've gone too far this time,\" I mutter to myself, shaking my head in disbelief. I summon my secretary to arrange an emergency meeting with the New Horizons team.\n\n\"Cancel their AMA and get them to my office ASAP. This is an order!\" I bark into the phone.\n\nThe team arrives within the hour, courtesy of a private jet I've arranged. I don't care about the potential backlash or conspiracy theories; I need answers, and I need them now.\n\nWe convene in the meeting hall, the tension palpable. I break the silence, my anger and frustration boiling over.\n\n\"What is the meaning of this? Do you have any explanation for this debacle? You think this government can cover up such a massive lie every time?\"\n\nThe team leader stammers, \"Sir, I'm sorry... it was just a hoax to gain more attention and funding. We—\"\n\n\"A hoax?\" I interrupt, my voice rising. \"Have you seen the panic this has caused? People are terrified, and they're looking to me for answers. The whole world is waiting for my response.\"\n\nThe team leader continues, \"But, sir, if we can maintain this charade for a little longer, we can become the dominant global power. Our economy would be unstoppable.\"\n\nI slam my fist on the table. \"No! No more lies. I can't deceive the public anymore. Elon Musk would uncover the truth anyway. We need to come clean.\"\n\nOne of the team members whispers, \"Sir, we've arranged for a contract killer to take care of Elon Musk. He's an insider, the same person who—\"\n\nI cut him off, my anger boiling over. \"Listen, you fool! First, never interrupt me again. Second, I've had enough of your fake deference. The world deserves the truth.\"\n\nThe room falls silent once more. I rise from my chair, my voice shaking with emotion.\n\n\"I was 11 when we first landed on the moon. That was my reality. But as President, I've discovered that it was all a lie. And for what? To win a bloody space race? We can't toy with people's emotions like this.\"\n\nI gesture to my secretary. \"Call the media.

    "Draw inspiration from a game of Civilization, like one of my own experiences from Civilization 4 (I never got to play 5 due to my outdated computer). \n\nIn this scenario, Emperor Wang Kon lifted his head, focusing on his aged, stocky adviser. Had he dozed off again? Four hours of sleep no longer seemed sufficient. \n\n\"What news do you bring me?\" he asked, his voice firm. \n\n\"We've received word from Cuzco, sire. The Incas have declared war,\" the adviser replied, his tone measured. \n\nWang Kon had anticipated this move, given Huayna Capac's boasts and threats. \"I suppose they're mobilizing their forces towards our northern provinces?\" \n\n\"Yes, Your Grace. We have three battalions stationed in Pyongyang and Wonsan each,\" the adviser confirmed. \n\nThe emperor calculated that these troops would hold out for a while. However, the main Korean force was still engaged in fierce battles across Mongolia, where Kublai Khan's under-equipped and outdated troops were wearing them down with sheer numbers. \n\nAs Wang Kon stood up, his joints creaked in protest. He felt the weight of his years. \"It seems the Mongolians are opting for a war of attrition. Send a letter to Kublai Khan, offering peace. He may be cruel and shallow, but he's not foolish. He'll accept our offer, especially if it means draining our treasury for reparations.\" \n\nAs he walked across the grand imperial hall, the adviser followed, still clutching notes, maps, and letters. \"We have other news, sire. The Indians have sworn allegiance to the Inca empire.\" \n\nWang Kon's response was laced with disdain. \"Of course they have. What else would a sycophant like Gandhi do?\" He quickened his pace, his mind racing with the implications. The Indians might be treacherous, but they possessed a formidable military that could rain destruction upon Korean cities if Wang failed in his duty. \n\n\"See if you can establish communication with the Mayans and Greeks. They have no love for the Incas, and I doubt they'll be willing to sacrifice their trade relations with us, no matter how intimidating Huayna's legions may seem.\" \n\nThe adviser bowed his head and departed, leaving Wang Kon to gaze upon the magnificent tapestries adorning the palace walls. These ancient stories of conquest and glory seemed to mock him now, filling him with feelings of insignificance and fear.",
    "Imagine winning a golden ticket to visit the fabled factory of [real-life company], a place where magic meets innovation. I've heard whispers from friends at Dupont, a leading plastics and chemicals manufacturing company, about the wonders that lie within its walls. They speak of control systems and stress strain curves with an infectious enthusiasm that's hard to ignore. I couldn't wait to experience it for myself.\n\nAs I stepped off the bus with five fellow travelers, all around my age, I noticed we were all clutching a mysterious, flexible sheet reminiscent of carbon fiber. The air was electric with excitement as we exchanged introductions, each of us eager to make connections and showcase our knowledge. The conversation was a whirlwind of complex topics - non-Newtonian behaviors, models, control systems, and algorithms - that left me, a humble paint technician, in awe.\n\nBut as we entered the corporation's headquarters, all eyes were on our flamboyant host, Doug D.D. Dupont, resplendent in his shimmering attire. \"Greetings and salutations!\" he boomed, welcoming us to the main manufacturing hub. \"We hope you enjoy our little tour, and please, hold your questions until the end.\" Our group was like a pack of hungry wolves, ready to pounce on any opportunity to impress our potential future employer.\n\nAs we followed Doug through the building, we passed through a sleek reception area, where the receptionist handed us guest passes made of an unusual material that sparked curiosity in a few of us. We then ventured into the heart of the facility, bypassing the well-lit labs and offices to reach a hidden corner that seemed frozen in time. A service elevator, cramped but full of promise, awaited us. Our tour guide was practically bouncing with excitement, as if he couldn't wait to unveil the secrets behind door number one.\n\nAs the elevator doors opened, we spilled out into a new world, our senses on high alert. The adventure had only just begun, and I couldn't wait to see what wonders lay ahead.",
    "I've been sitting on my gold hoard for eons, watching hero after hero come and go. They always show up with grand speeches about how they're going to take me down, but none of them ever follow through. But you, you're different. You stroll in, toss a coin onto my pile, and look me straight in the eye. Then you say, 'I've got a proposition for you.' I've got to admit, I'm intrigued.\n\nAs a dragon, I'm wired to be greedy. I like to think of myself as a collector, but humans just call me a monster. They send their best warriors to try and take me down, to claim my treasure for themselves. Ha! Not even the strongest and bravest of them can take me out. That's why they started calling me the Dragon of Promise. While my fellow dragons were hunted almost to extinction, I managed to survive. And it's all thanks to you, traitor.\n\nI've seen plenty of humans come and go, but you caught me off guard. You walked into my lair with confidence, using the old tithe to get my attention. I was annoyed, to say the least. But I'm a patient dragon, so I listened to what you had to say. And I remember your words perfectly.\n\nYou said, 'Humans are born from light, but all we bring is darkness, death, and destruction. We're sick beings at our core. I know you hate us, so I'm asking you to grant me power. I'll take care of the ones who killed your siblings.' Physical death doesn't mean much to me, since the spirit of the dragon is immortal. I still remember when you carried me out of this cave, into the sunlight for the first time in a thousand years. In my new form, clad in my bones, humans would cower at your feet.\n\nSo, bearer mine, give me your arm. Let's fill the world with teeth together.",
    "In a shocking twist, it wasn't the Nazis who had been hiding on the dark side of the moon. It was the Roman Empire, and they were back with a vengeance. \"Prepare to breach atmosphere, Legate!\" the captain barked.\n\n\"Let it be done,\" Legate Caecilius Petrus Belisarius replied, his voice dripping with authority. He stood tall on the bridge of his colossal flagship, the *Cerberus*, his brilliant red cape flowing behind him like a river of fire. The gold sunbursts on his shoulders glinted in the dim light, and his helmet, adorned with a majestic bristle of red horse hair, seemed to radiate an aura of power.\n\nHis breastplate, specially crafted for this momentous occasion, told a story of its own. An intricate engraving of a massive bull, its horns lowered and charging, seemed to come alive as the ship's lights danced across its surface. The bull's hooves pounded through stylized waves, whipping them into a frenzy of foam. Belisarius's burnished bronze boots and greaves reflected the blinking yellow and red lights of the console before him, casting an otherworldly glow.\n\nFrom his elevated platform, he gazed out upon his crew, clad in sleek black uniforms, as they worked with precision at the three banks of consoles. The bright blue earth filled the enormous window in front of them, a tantalizing reminder of the conquest to come.\n\nThe engines roared to life, a deafening sound that shook the very foundations of the ship. Belisarius felt a slight tremor beneath his feet before the inertial dampeners kicked in, stabilizing the vessel. The earth began its slow rotation downwards in the window as the captain oriented the ship for atmospheric entry. In mere moments, the window was filled with the inky blackness of space, which was quickly replaced by a fiery red glow.\n\nThis was the moment of truth. The *Cerberus* was a behemoth of a ship, stretching over a kilometer in length and two stadia across at its widest point. If they were to fail, it would be here, in the crucible of atmospheric entry. The heat shields could fail, or the structure could buckle under the colossal stress, sending them all to a fiery grave. But Belisarius took comfort in the knowledge that if either of those catastrophes occurred, they would have mere milliseconds to realize their fate before being incinerated.\n\nYet the *Cerberus* held steady, a testament to the ingenuity of Roman engineering. Designed by the descendants of the master builders who crafted the aqueducts and the Coliseum, this ship was built to last for millennia.\n\nAs they burned through the sky, the ship glowed like a coal, its fiery trail illuminating the darkness. And then, there were three more coals, followed by a dozen, and soon a hundred, as *Legio X Fretensis* began its invasion. The die was cast, and the fate of the world hung in the balance.",
    "I'm stuck in the Old Hell because I overslept and missed the move to New Hell. I never found Hell to be that bad, maybe because I have a high pain tolerance. The demons weren't scary, and the punishments made sense since we knew we deserved them. The best part was being surrounded by people, which helped me overcome my loneliness issues.\n\nI ended up in Hell because of a stupid mistake I made as a teenager. I put cyanide in a party mix as revenge against a host who had locked me in a cold, dark locker. I drank it myself to avoid getting in trouble, but it ended up sending everyone to Hell.\n\nAt first, the people I wronged were angry with me, but after 40 years, we made peace and became friends. We even had fun despite the torture around us. I was happy for the first time in my life and afterlife.\n\nWhen we were told to move to New Hell, we were excited to see what all the fuss was about. We joked and laughed as we waited in line, but when it was my turn, the head demon pulled me back and sent the others through the portal without me. Now I'm alone in the cold, dark Old Hell, and it's getting lonelier by the minute.",
    "Every person has the power to change the past once, but altering significant events turns those affected into mental vegetables. After the discovery, people were both thrilled and terrified.

    "\"I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End.\" These words, etched in the annals of human history, are the only truth they got right. The rest is a jumbled mess of misinterpretation and vitriol. They think they can banish me from my own domain? It's laughable. They have no concept of what it's like to invest everything in humanity, only to be repaid with a ravaged planet, stripped bare of its beauty, and a realm consumed by hatred and sin.\n\nPerhaps I did go too far this time. I vowed to never again unleash my wrath upon their fragile existence. In doing so, I became as human as they are. Souls gather at my doorstep, awaiting judgment, but it's a task that proves difficult without my own guidance. They can't fathom the weight of my responsibility, the crushing guilt that accompanies every life and death. I've had eons to plan, to experiment, and yet each attempt ends in the same futile cycle.\n\nTime may seem infinite, but I know it will eventually come to a standstill. Until then, I'll endure the repetition, the maddening cycle of creation and destruction. Oh, how I long for the end, for the stillness that will finally bring me peace."
