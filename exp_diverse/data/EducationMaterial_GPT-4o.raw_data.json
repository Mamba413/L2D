    "The world has been shattered by Russia’s attack on Ukraine in the past few days. Ukraine’s forces have put up remarkable resistance to this attack, but the war is entering an even bloodier phase. Europe could be witnessing the first major military invasion in years. Many people have been displaced, and many Ukrainian citizens have fled neighboring countries for peace. Gunshots and artillery fires have been raining down on residential areas in Ukraine, with several media houses and newspapers reporting the events and sharing the news with the rest of the world. Various newspapers have reported the news differently, with the difference seen in headlines, videos and images posted. The two newspapers covering the events in Ukraine are the New York Times and Le Monde, a French newspaper. While New York Times and Le Monde report the same event, the two use very different terms to describe similar activities. In the recent takeover of the city of Kharkiv by the Russian forces, for example, the NYT headline read “Russian Troops Take Over Kharkiv,” Le Monde , on the other hand, read “La Russie A Envahi Kharkiv” to mean “Russia Has Invaded Kharkiv.” Recently a video of Ukrainian citizens making Molotov cocktail Petrol bombs was shared. The headline in NYT read, “Ukraine Prepare Molotov Cocktail In Kyiv.” Le Monde ‘s headline read “Ukrainian Resistance Using Molotov Bombs.” Because headlines are the deciding factor for people to read an article, newspapers make them enticing. The New York Times uses headlines that suggest this is another world war, while Le Monde downplays the illegality of what Russia is doing. The differences seen in the headlines of the two newspapers are all for the attraction of their audiences; each magazine writes eye-catching unique topics.",
    "Charles Schwab is a for-profit Corporation whose main business is savings and loans. The company provides banking and asset management services, and financial advisory. It has several subsidiaries – Charles Schwab & Co., Inc., Charles Schwab Investment Management, Inc., TD Ameritrade, Inc., and TD Ameritrade Clearing, Inc., which are all limited liability companies (“The Charles Schwab Corporation,” 2021). This paper aims to analyze the form of business in Charles Schwab Corporation (CSC). Charles Schwab is a corporation, which is a form of business with some distinctive features. Firstly, its officers are agents, unlike its directors and shareholders, which means that the latter are not involved in the company’s current strategic, managerial and other business decisions (“Corporation,” 2022). Secondly, the corporation is managed by the board of directors who have the right to appoint the officers. This approach creates a balance of managerial forces, since CEOs and CFOs are directly involved in the work processes, and the board of directors, in extreme cases, has the right to dismiss them by voting. In the corporation, shareholders are free to transfer ownership, which means that in critical situations such as bankruptcy, the corporation can be sold to another owner. This outcome is possible because the corporation is an organization that creates an opportunity for investors to profit by investing, unlike an LLC (“Forming a corporation,” 2022). Finally, in corporations, the income is taxed twice: the first time at the corporate level, and a second time if dividends are distributed to shareholders. Thus, the form of business in Charles Schwab Corporation was analyzed. The CSC is a corporation with several subsidiaries and conducts business following the requirements for a corporation form of organization. A distinctive feature of corporations is the board of directors, which has an indirect influence on daily decision-making. Still, in critical cases, it can appoint new officers to manage the company. Corporations can also transfer property rights in the event of bankruptcy or other cases.",
    "The work of a clinical or medical office worker is characterized by a combination of a large number of administrative operations with medical activities. Primarily, these professionals are office assistants filling out paperwork and interacting with staff (“How to become a medical office assistant,” 2021). As a result, I will be approaching interviews for this job in a professional business style. While the fitting suit can be expensive, I already have the proper formal attire. Using my black formal suit, shoes, and minimal accessories, I can make the right impression without reducing my budget. In warm weather, I can go to an interview right in a suit, and in cold weather, I can add my usual outerwear, for example, an overcoat. Work clothes, theoretically, may require additional investments and purchases. All healthcare workers, including office workers, must wear a special uniform called scrubs, consisting of a short-sleeved shirt and trousers. This uniform is relatively cheap, and a single set of scrubs can be found on Amazon for about $20-$40 (“Medical assistant’s uniform,” 2019). Most of all, in this context, one needs to take care of shoes since these specialists sometimes have to stand or walk a lot. A good pair of closed-toe shoes can cost around $100, but I have tennis shoes that fit the dress code (“Medical assistant’s uniform,” 2019). However, it must be taken into account that many medical institutions issue uniforms on their own, considering them as consumables, so the choice of purchasing a uniform will depend on the rules of a particular hospital. In any case, it is simple and easy to wear, so it will not entail high costs. Reflecting on the points studied and prepared, I want to note that the new information will affect my budget and life plan very little. In the best case, if the hospital issues uniforms, I won’t have to spend any money at all, as I can wear my existing suit for the interview and shoes for work. In the worst case, I will still be within the budget when I have to buy everything for work. Therefore, I can put that $200 aside and mentally prepare for possible demands from my interviewers. In addition, this study showed that the issue of clothing for interviews and work is not a problem for me, and I am already prepared for it in many respects.",
    "Carl Jung identifies the mother complex with an innate feeling of care at the center of the emotional attachment between a mother and a child. However, in the absence of such an attachment, an archetype develops where someone’s mother fails to satisfy the essential demands associated with the relationship. The outcome leads the victim, the child, to seek comfort elsewhere (Bobroff 35). At the core of the mother complex is the mother archetype, meaning that in every emotional attachment, between the child and the mother, on the one hand, an archetype nourishing and security image manifests. On the other hand, an archetype that devours possessiveness, deprivation, and darkness comes out (Bobroff 36). In the film Every Secret Thing , a complex emotional attachment between Alice and her mother exists and forms the underlying relationship between the two and the association with the kidnaps taking place. The complex relationship between Alice and her mother places Alice at the center of the kidnapping. Hellen is disgusted by Alice to the point of considering Ronnie her child of choice, a position that makes Alice deeply insecure. Moreover, the tension in interracial affairs is associated with the second kidnapping and having born a biracial child while in prison, and given it up for adoption, Alice becomes the primary suspect in the case (Berg). Alice’s mother, the mastermind behind the kidnap, in the first and second cases, and murder, in the first case, plants evidence to ensure Alice stands out as the main suspect. Hellen, through betrayal and deception, purposely Alice ends up in prison (Berg). Further, compared to the indifference in Ronnie’s parents, there is no emotional attachment between the parents and their daughters. As the film comes to an end, the audience learns that not only were Alice and Ronnie falsely imprisoned, the justice system failed to prove that Helen is the killer.",
    "The article describes a recent Chicago hot dog restaurant incident that can be considered an ethical issue. The incident involved a man who was asked to wear a mask to use the restaurant’s services (Sutton, 2022). In response, the man offended the restaurant employee by throwing snow in their face several times (Sutton, 2022). Additionally, the offender broke the glass door with an unknown object (Sutton, 2022). This incident can be considered an ethical issue because the offender’s actions were disproportional to the situation, apart from the obvious property damage offense. Furthermore, throwing snow at an employee might not count as illegal; however, it is blatantly disrespectful toward an individual. A utilitarian point of view would consider this incident wrong by examining the consequences of the offender’s actions. The seeming reason behind the offender’s behavior is the employee’s request to wear a mask, which is the state’s mandate. Utilitarianism would view the restaurant visitor’s decision to commit an offense against the employee and the restaurant’s property, starting with the consequences of these actions. Since the result is a broken glass door and an innocent employee that suffered, the consequences are harmful. As such, from the utilitarian point of view, the actions can be considered wrong. The Kantian moral theory views an issue as irrational since following the moral law and duty is rational behavior. Offering an innocent individual and damaging the restaurant’s property can be immoral. As such, dismissing the moral law renders the offender irrational in the eyes of a follower of a Kantian moral theory. I believe that utilitarianism is the most logical way to conclude this ethical problem. The reason for that is that negative consequences for anybody can be the best moral compass for almost any decision. The Kantian moral theory is based on moral law, which can be subjective in some people’s minds. As such, according to Kantian theory, some people might disagree that the incident is an ethical issue. In contrast, according to utilitarianism, a negative impact on any individual renders an action wrong.",
    "The primary source for this study is the general medical journal The Lancet. It publishes the survey data and provides statistics and a comparative analysis of the obtained quantitative information. The Economist can be seen as a secondary source that describes research with less digital content. The study represents a decrease in the HIV infection rate of girls in school by stabilizing their families’ financial difficulties. The World Bank funded the study to demonstrate the value of money in reducing the spread of HIV among young, poor girls. The study was authored by Berk Özler, Lead Economist and Poverty Research Manager. The medical journal The Lancet presented statistics based on a survey in the Zomba district of Malawi (G.C. 2). The Economist later summarized the study with the most critical findings from the analysis. Thus, 1,300 unmarried girls aged 13 to 22 took part in the study. This is a sufficient number of subjects to consider the prevalence of HIV in poor areas. The sampling took place with the help of a computer, so the girls fell into different experimental groups randomly. Thus, a group stood out in which girls and their families were given small amounts of money every month, girls paid to attend school, and girls left without financial support. Based on the study, it can be concluded that the subjects who received the money in both groups showed a significant reduction in the spread of the virus. However, test subjects with no money were forced to look for a sugar daddy. Therefore, in this group of issues, the statistics of the spread of HIV were preserved. Thus, the drug called money is adequate and affects the spread of STDs. The implication is that the global community needs funding to stop the spread of HIV. However, research and further assistance to young girls have several limitations. Firstly, it is hard to understand how much money each person needs to stop looking for sugar daddies and move on with their lives. Moreover, the study was conducted over 18 months, so it is impossible to assess how it will work in the long term",
    "Horror films have become one of the fundamental genres of cinema, the popularity of which is not inferior to the other styles. The reason for it is the specific reaction of the target audience, namely a powerful emotional impulse. Moreover, it becomes a psychological relief for some persons, which helps to distract from one’s problems. Horror films are not the modern version of public lynching; they formulate a way for people to obtain a strong emotional response through fear. Fear is a primary human emotion, which manifests itself as an instinct for self-preservation, namely a reaction to a potential threat. It may seem strange for one that people pay money to feel such an unpleasant emotion while watching horror films. However, in the essay Why We Crave Horror Movies , Stephen King argued that people aim to re-establish their feelings of essential normality (King, 1). In other words, one tries to reset their ordinary feelings for many reasons. Some are distracting from problems in this way, others get a dose of adrenaline, and sometimes horror films become a way to throw out their emotions in a movie theater and not on other people. Any art must evoke emotion and promote the individual experiencing ethical pleasure. Watching horror movies seems to have nothing to do with the ethical aspect. However, the success of horror movies, to more extent than other genres, depends on the audience’s reaction (Glasby, 7). The strong reaction makes horror films stand out in terms of the criteria for assessing art. Indeed, few people can lag behind absolutely indifferent when watching scary scenes. Besides, the powerful emotional response makes horror films so popular and successful nowadays. To conclude, one identified that horror films do not formulate a form of modern public lynching. They are the one’s method to receive the bright, emotive response. There are various reasons for it, beginning from obtaining psychological discharge and ending to distracting from reality and one’s urgent problems. The audience’s reaction is the key point to evaluating the horror film’s success and why it is considered art.",
    "A mutation is a change in the genome of an organism. Most commonly, mutations are defined as changes in DNA structure that occur due to disruption of the sequence of genes or the emergence of new genes. In this paper, I would like to talk about spontaneous mutations. Spontaneous mutations occur by chance – for example if a sheep is suddenly born in a flock of sheep with shorter legs; such mutations can also occur in humans. The ADRB1 gene, for example, is responsible for regulating the amount of sleep a person needs each night to function properly. Most humans need eight hours of sleep or more, but about 5% of the population enjoys a slightly different mutant version. Tests done on a mother and daughter who had the mutation revealed the ability to sleep only 4 to 6 hours each night (Servick, 2019). This mutation refers to a type of genomic mutation. The protein encoded by the mutation is a receptor for norepinephrine. This mutation is dominant, autosomal, and beneficial in its effect on the viability of individuals. Changes in the ADRB1 gene occur primarily in humans. However, they can also be in animals, although no studies have yet been conducted. Such a mutation does not affect the human population in the general world. This is mainly due to the fact that it is not dangerous and is not life-threatening to its carriers. Thus, such a mutation is only a positive addition to the life abilities of a human carrier. This mutation is sporadic and is not a dominant trend in population genome changes despite its dominance. I find this example interesting because natural changes in the human genome open up new possibilities for the population. Thus, studying such changes is essential for human development and a deeper study of human capabilities.",
    "In his graphic novel, Spiegelman uses a literary device known as anthropomorphism to show the difference between races, including Americans, the Germans, and the Jews. This device makes the severe issue seem simpler to understand, and the readers pay more attention to the ideas expressed by the author. In Maus , Spiegelman portrays the horrors of the holocaust and reminds the readers that the holocaust’s victims and survivors also had their own lives and dreams. The first section to be discussed is Chapter 1 – “The Sheik.” In this section, the main character Artie asks his father Vladek to tell him about his life during the war. Instead of describing the horrors Vladek faced during the holocaust, he prefers to tell his son about his happy and careless life in 1935 (Spiegelman, 1980, pp. 13-23). This desire to recall the good old days proves that the victims of the war prefer to remember the pleasant times. The second section is Chapter 3- “Prisoner of War.” In this part of the novel, Vladek talks about the first events he witnessed as a soldier. Interestingly, Vladek remembers the name of a soldier he killed, and this detail shows that even during the terrible events, one’s brain catches the small and unmeaningful things (Spiegelman, 1980, p. 50). Finally, Vladek says that he was reunited with his family, and this event matters more than what he experienced as a prisoner of war. The third part to analyze is Chapter 5 – “Mouse Holes.” This section shows that, for many mice, war is a series of difficult decisions that must be made in order for them to try to survive (Spiegelman, 1980). Even when parents learn about the death of their children, they need to keep a cold mind so as not to get caught by the cats. To draw a conclusion, one may say that this graphic novel is a unique literary work about World War II. In these comic drawings, Spiegelman managed to portray the horrors of the holocaust and those little but meaningful things that supported the victims and helped some of them to remain hopeful. Despite the fact that the war was full of violence and murders, the author shows the irony of the situation – the Germans are just animals who imagine they are better than others.",
    "The creation of a web-based system to store the university’s information on students and their transcripts presents certain risks that need to be addressed in the feasibility report. Using the standard risk evaluation process, it is possible to differentiate the risks into two large groups. These are risks to the continuation and completion of the project and risks to the end product’s performance after the project has been completed. The risks to the continuation and completion of the project are as follows:   * Unforeseen delays and time expenditures. It is possible that the project’s implementation will be more complex than anticipated, requiring more time;   * Individuals participating in the project might become sick and slow down production;   * The available hardware and software may malfunction. The risks for the performance of the end product are as follows:   * The product might not be secure enough to be allowed to work with personal student data;   * The product would be economically unfeasible to run;   * The product would not perform adequately to the university’s requirements. Time-related problems could be identified by comparing the progress made with the timeline developed before starting the project. Functionality and requirements risks can be discovered by matching the product against its requirements for it, as well as through testing during specific project milestones. Potential time constraints and personnel/hardware breakages can be accounted for by allocating more time to the project than initially estimated to allow for replacements to be made. Countering the risks associated with site performance would be more difficult and largely have a reactionary nature, should some of them not be discovered and remedied during the product testing phase.",
    "The computation of the three ratios Return on Assets (RoA) Return on Equity (RoE) Profit Margin The purpose and information conveyed by each ratios The three ratios presented and computed in the previous section represent vital profit generation indicators for a modern commercial organization. The return on assets (RoA) shows how well the company utilizes the entirety of its assets, including the borrowed ones, to generate financial returns. The return on equity is largely similar to this metric, but it does not consider the debt of the company (Gallo, 2016). Finally, the profit margin is one of the most important indicators of financial health, as it draws a direct comparison between sales and profits, showing how much the company actually earns from its operations. ABC Company review on three ratios First of all, the ABC Company’s business model can be deemed successful, as it generates adequate profits. Optimal returns on equity and assets show that the investors can reasonably expect returns on their participation in the company’s financing. The profit margin is also considerable, which means that this aspect of the firm is handled well. The profitability of the company Overall, the ABC Company remains a profitable enterprise that successfully converts its assets into revenues. The profit margin is over 50%, which is commendable, even though the overall turnover is below $1 million. Therefore, the business model on its own functions well, allowing the ABC Company to retain a stable position on the market. However, it may not suffice for the sustained growth in the long-term. ABC Company financial successful While the ABC Company’s financial statement may present positive indicators, it would be unwise to consider the company in isolation. Instead, it appears to interesting to compare the entity’s performance against the industry’s leaders to identify the areas in which it excels or where the improvements are needed. First of all, the return on assets is provided by Rose (2022), indicating that the industry’s average was set at 9.1-9.3% across the past four years. The ABC Company’s figures are considerably higher at the moment with 28.3%, but it is important to note that its absolute cash flows are not on par with the industry’s leaders. Thus, it is possible that the ABC Company’s ratios will become lower as the entity continues to grow. This difference becomes particularly evident when the income levels are compared with the industry’s average figures. As far as net income is concerned, the industry has averaged at $4.7 million in 2020. The ABC Company is far from this level, as its net income is only $77,000, which implies that it still has a long growth phase ahead. Furthermore, the industry’s leaders, such as Williams-Sonoma, have hundreds of millions of sales, whereas the ABC Company only has half-a-million. As the total assets of the company increase, there is no guarantee that its profit margins and returns on investment will remain equally high. Under these circumstances, the emphasis will be on maintaining the profitability of operations above the average level across the industry.",
    "Portraying the lives of gods and depicting relationships between them, as well as their interactions with humans, both “Iliad” and “Metamorphosis” elaborate on the theme of power abuse by those at the helm. In “Iliad,” Agamemnon has to face retribution due to his constant abuse of power: “be ready, that I be not left,/Alone of all the Greeks, without my prize” (Homer, 762 B. C.). Likewise, in “Metamorphosis,” various deities display complete disrespect for those of lesser power: “What had escaped the waves, now feared the flame” (Ovid, 8 B.C.). However, unlike the “Iliad,” “Metamorphosis” rarely demonstrates the comeuppance that deities have to face for their negligence of mortals’ needs (Homer, 762 B. C.; Ovid, 8 B. C.). Therefore, while thematically similar, “Iliad” and “Metamorphosis” represent slightly different perspectives on the problem o power abuse. The theme of mortals’ protection, which is central both to “Iliad” and “Metamorphosis,” remains essential nowadays as well. Namely, a range of contemporary leaders appear to have tremendous amounts of power due to their political influence, their economic one, or a combination of both (Homer, 762 B. C.; Ovid, 8 B. C.). For instance, the disregard for human rights in countries such as China, where leaders attain the status of god-like creatures, can be seen as similar to the one in the “Iliad” and “Metamorphosis.” However, what makes “Metamorphosis” slightly less effective in this regard is the comedic manner in which it portrays the abuse of mortals. In turn, “Iliad,” being a more serious work, produces a much greater impact by condemning the violence of omnipotent gods toward humans, which is more in line with the current concept of power abuse. Nevertheless, both the “Iliad” and “Metamorphosis” carry an important message and a deep meaning. Providing an insight into power dynamics within Ancient Greek society, they also help recognize similar patterns in the modern community.",
    "The article of Zulaika (2022) presents the impact of COVID-19 lockdowns on adolescent pregnancy and school dropout among secondary school girls in Kenya. The cases of teenage pregnancy started in Kenya after the country-wide school closure that started from March 2020 and lasted until January 2021. Zulaika (2022) examine to what extent the pandemic affected sexual and reproductive health of adolescents in Rarieda subcounty. The study shows there was a limited involvement of health administrators on the issue of pregnancy among school girls. Teenagers lack sexual education and are not aware of different methods of protection. Health administrators should find this issue important as early pregnancy can be dangerous for girls’ health and lead to various socio-economic problems in the future. Moreover, if such a rate of adolescent pregnancy continues to increase, there would be less educated females in Kenya. Zulaika (2022) also mentions that stress level of pregnant teenagers is high, affecting mental as well as physical health of young future mothers. To tackle this issue, Zulaika (2022) suggests implementing population-level emergencies on girls that are going to school. Students should be educated for the basics of sexual education and for the side effects of sexual life. Furthermore, the article points out that infectious diseases can be spread rapidly if school girls do not know the importance of contraceptives. As such, there is a need to the national project of informing school students and their parents about sexual and reproductive issues. The effects of COVID-19 on teenage pregnancy are negative, causing additional social and economic problems not only for the pregnant girls and their families but also for the whole country.",
    "Primarily, one should note that the country that I chose to perform the assignment is France. Undoubtedly, there are many consulates of France in the United States. However, to take the remains to the “homeland,” it is required to contact a special consulate general located in California, Los Angeles. In this context, a “mourner” should arrange a meeting in the office with a specialist two days in advance to discuss all the details and points regarding the dispatch of human remains and sealing an urn ( Shipment of cremated remains , 2019). Thus, the Consulate General of France in Los Angeles is one of the most relevant places to ask for help to remove “remnants.” Accordingly, I have to provide the following merchandise to the family in the future. First of all, it is necessary to prepare a package of particular documents. For instance, they include a death certificate of a loved one in the US, a medical report, and a certificate of cremation and sealing. Moreover, an attestation of the absence of extraneous attachments and closed sealing of the urn, a certificate of the lack of infectious diseases from the deceased, and a permit to import remains will be required. It is also essential to have a person’s permission to request repatriation and a certified French translation of the death and cremation certificate. Secondly, this family needs an urn with the ashes of the dead, located in a special airtight container. Moreover, there are not too complicated requirements regarding the transportation of the urn in France. A person must apply directly to the French consulate in the US and prepare a package of documents set out above. There are several airlines engaged in the transportation of ashes, one of the most reliable and well-known is Air France-KLM. In most cases, the tame frames are based on an agreement between funeral companies in America and the destination country. The consulate member I have had to communicate with is Julie Duhaut-Bedos. In addition, the flight booking service would be accompanied by the consulate’s help. Depending on the distance, it is necessary to book a direct flight or with a transfer. Furthermore, each airline offers individual conditions for the transportation of special cargo. The urn with the ashes of a loved one would be carefully sealed and placed in a special lockable box with dense walls. Transporting the loved one by plane is possible only in the luggage compartment.",
    "Amazon has grown to become one of the most important companies in the US. Millions of people rely on the highly efficient deliveries and cheap prices. Moreover, the company has turned into one of the largest employees, as numerous Amazon fulfillment centers are scattered across the country. With such scale, a wide range of issues inevitably arise. Recently the multiple complaints concerning the way Amazon treats it workers have managed to draw public attention. Therefore, a dedicate analysis is need in order to understand what kind of working conditions and atmosphere the IT giant provides. Key Problems: Job Dissatisfaction and High Turnover Rates Guaranteeing $15 an hour may be a nice incentive for people in poor neighborhoods, but only in the short run. Motivating people to work better by gradually increasing their pay would be not only more appealing and psychologically comfortable, but also highly beneficial in the long run. Task assignments and worker motivation interact through the extent of labor market competition – that is, the possibility of moving to another firm (Bar-Isaac & Levy, 2022). Therefore, Amazon should consider applying a more traditional approach to motivating workers, which will help to reduce current turnover rates. Cause: Poor Motivation Techniques E-commerce is no longer as lucrative as it used to be a decade ago. It has become the primary way people do shopping, especially in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic. Therefore, numerous new companies have jumped at the opportunity and managed to extend their market shares. Thus, Amazon is determined to cut costs substantially by various means, including the construction of its fulfillment centres in the neighborhoods that have not fully recovered from recent economic recessions. According to Kinicki (2020), turnover is one of the major outcomes that should be considered while tailoring the set of inputs. Currently, the company’s turnover rate continues to be extremely high. Desired Solution: Utilizing More Conservative Motivation Frameworks The emphasis on fear, the discouragement of camaraderie and many other Amazon’s current policies substantially undermine employee’s motivation and the company’s public image. The desired potential solution plan includes the introduction of systematic pay raises, the enhancement of bonus systems and changing the way employees are timed. These steps will help the IT giant to motivate employees in a much more positive and respectful way.",
    "American slavery arose as a way of exploiting labor within capitalism but gradually took shape in an autonomous socio-economic and political structure. Over time, a liberation movement began, which implied the illegality and unethical “ownership” of people. However, even after official emancipation, the slaves were dependent on the state and slave owners in the past, with a lack of resources for subsistence. Without documents, financial resources, and moral support, it was difficult for new members of society to integrate into a standard life. Additionally, discrimination and lack of inclusion as a phenomenon continued to exist. Slavery was abolished as a result of the Civil War between the northern and southern states. The passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to the US Constitution in January 1865 brought a permanent end to slavery in the US, making it illegal and anti-constitutional. Currently, this phenomenon in the United States is considered one of the most shameful episodes in the history of the country. At the same time, an urgent question arises whether the state should have compensated the slaves for the material and spiritual damage that was caused to them in the process. Even if slave labor is not officially permitted and the slaves are freed, without the provision of basic resources for life, survival is unlikely. The concept and attitude of society also affect the acceptance rate of new members. In the case of unequal chances of receiving the same benefits, the slaves in the past have more difficulties, challenges, and complexities on the path of integration. In this regard, the new slaves were not truly emancipated, as they were still dependent on a source of resources for subsistence.",
    "The present essay analyzes a manual for the use of a dishwasher developed by Bosch. The first positive characteristic of this manual is that it contains a lot of illustrations that make it easier to understand how to use the dishwasher. For instance, the manual depicts how to add rinse aid, arrange crockery in the dishwasher, and remove baskets (Bosch, n.d.). Thus, the manual is focused on its audience, who is not expected to know very well how to use the dishwasher. Besides, the section on the installation of the machine is not detailed and contains only fundamental suggestions. Hence, the authors of the manual expect it to be installed by professionals. Another reason that proves that this manual focuses on the audience is that the largest part of the text is presented in the form of bullet points. Therefore, a user could easily and quickly find all necessary information in the manual. The manual is problem-oriented, purposeful, and persuasive because it addresses precise issues that users might face. For example, it explains how to select the right program for specific types of crockery and food remains, cancel and stop the program, and check the condition of the machine. Even though the text is written without technical terminology, the manual remains professional. This conclusion is based on the fact that in the instruction, one could find answers to a wide range of specific questions. The manual contains instructions on how to use the dishwasher, take care of it, install, dispose of wastes, and what to do in case of a failure. As it has already been mentioned, the examined manual is designed-centered. It contains numerous illustrations, schemes, and bullet points that make it easy to read. What is more, near the paragraphs with warnings, a related sign is inserted. The exclamation point in a red triangle draws the attention of a reader and makes him or her focus on the content of the section. The manual is also logical: the first section is dedicated to the components of the dishwasher; in the second one, the manual tells the audience how to put tableware in it. Afterward, there is information on how to add water softener, salt, and rinse aid. Finally, the manual explains how to take care of the device and how to act in case of a problem.",
    "Referring to competition’s nature, the competitive landscape covers multiple aspects, including, the number and size of companies, their weaknesses and strengths, barriers to the market entry and exit, and substitutes’ threats. In the present day, it substantially differs from the traditional competitive environment that relied on large advertising budgets and economies of scale – and it continues to transform due to rapid technological progress. Due to constantly changing conditions, the contemporary competitive mindset is characterized by innovation, integration, flexibility, and speed. It relies on data in business decision-making in order to have competitive advantages and create transparent business processes, adapts to the latest market technologies, and aims to improve the consumer experience. In general, in order to stay competitive, the majority of companies focus on customer-oriented operations to meet people’s demands and strengthen brand awareness and loyalty. There are several drivers of the current competitive landscape, including new business models, consumer protection, price transparency, hypercompetition, and environmental awareness, however, the primary ones are flexibility and technologies. In other words, companies cannot implement only one strategy for stable growth and development and should use all technological advantages to outperform competitors. Thus, those companies that are flexible, apply various approaches, and see opportunities may succeed even in tough economic conditions. For instance, NVIDIA, a multinational technology company that designs graphics processing and chip units for professional markets, gaming, and mobile computing, performs excellently regardless of the COVID-19 recession. The company has taken advantage of a global lockdown and people’s self-isolation focusing on remote computing services and video gaming. For instance, approximately seven million Nintendo gaming consoles with NVIDIA’s chips were sold in the third quarter of 2020 (Fitch, 2020). This case demonstrates that in the current competitive landscape, those companies who may rapidly adapt to any conditions will be able to stay productive and highly demanded.",
    "Guaman Poma witnessed the injustices of the colonial government and personally suffered by its hands. He was the descendant of Incan noblemen who grew up after the conquest of Peru by the Spanish. His family was stripped of their lands and titles, and his attempts to regain them were continuously rebuffed by the colonial government (Kilroy-Ewbank, n.d.). Although he initially worked with the colonialists, Poma was exiled for supposedly false claims of nobility and then decided to publicly denounce the Spanish treatment of natives. He published a 1200-page illustrated document addressed to the Spanish king, chronicling the Andean way of life before invasion and the abuses they had suffered since under the Conquistadors. Poma’s manuscript illustrates the full horrors of colonialism and argues that the Spanish were foreign settlers who had no right to take control of the land God had given to Peruvians. He proposes a system of political organization wherein the government is representative of its people and adapted to their practical needs (Kilroy-Ewbank, n.d.). Poma has thus made a significant contribution to the discussions of liberty, political representation, social responsibility, and self-determinacy of individual states. His notion that the government should be created for and by the people that have historically occupied the land it rules over is strikingly modern. Furthermore, Poma’s work completely refutes the idea that Europeans brought civilization and political organization to the Incas. This interpretation is revealed as only a hypocritical pretense to justify violence, economic exploitation, and cultural erasure as a means of political control. It portrays how an entire way of life was completely destroyed and lost as its people were deprived of their freedom and forced to assimilate. Although Poma admires the moral standards the Spanish purport to uphold, he shows that they have not actually measured up to them.",
    "Background The action of the prayer effect is based on the regularities and peculiarities of cognitive processes. It is based on two attention abilities, namely, switching and concentration. In the course of prayer, people switch and focus on an area of higher spirituality. The requirement of regularity and systematic recitation of worship leads to frequent repetition of concentration on religious categories, strengthening the mental connection with God. Froese and Jones (2021) wrote in their article that prayer strengthens one’s faith in the supernatural and, therefore, it is a session of faith. In addition, public prayer has long been used as a tool to influence the political arena (Froese & Jones, 2021). Therefore, one can consider this phenomenon as a weapon, sacred and supernatural. The same idea that prayer is a weapon, and used politically, is also found in Martin’s article. Religion is familiar with precedents when it was possible to defeat enemy troops by force of turning to God (Martin, 2019). For example, in A.D. 174, by the power of prayer, a Roman legion was able to discover a spring of water, and the flood that followed washed away the enemies (Martin, 2019). In general, both authors emphasize that prayers serve as weapons and that their use brings people closer to God. Participants in the ritual often experience a sense of social acceptance and emotional uplift after the prayer is completed. The rhythmic and systematic repetition of prayers reinforces the ideals and guidelines of a particular religion (Froese & Jones, 2021). Martin also wrote about it in his article, he came to the conclusion that these circumstances determine why prayer can be used as an epiphany strategy. Proactivity manifests itself as a response to a stimulus; a prayer of this type responds to a vision for fate. Due to such rituals, it is possible to create the future by praying (Froese & Jones, 2021). People often asked God to protect them in battle throughout early Christian history. Prayers were used to ease the fear of the Israelites, strengthening their resolve long before Jesus was born (Martin, 2019). The initiators of such prayers were used to reassure soldiers before skirmishes. It was assured that they would be guaranteed a place in heaven if they won (Martin, 2019). Both authors mention that requests for intervention in this way have existed throughout Christian history. They are unanimously convinced that prayers are inherently proactive; there are no significant differences between their positions. Summary Repentance In his second letter to the Corinthians, Paul refers to repentance as sorrow for God’s sake, which leads to salvation (2 Corinthians 7:10). Repentance in Paul’s understanding is when one does not return to sin again. Repentance cleanses the soul, and a clean soul, in turn, is able to more fully receive the grace of the Holy Spirit.

    "Supporters of relativism believe that morality in the objective sense does not exist. The moral norms adopted in society are not obligatory for adherence and execution. In absolute terms, the concepts of evil and good are nothing more than fiction. In this regard, researcher Porus noted that moral relativism could easily degenerate into permissiveness (Bush and Moss, 2020). Moreover, people who adhere to this point of view can be perceived as the ones trying to devalue moral norms to the lowest possible level, will not attempt to seek compromises and negotiate on mutually beneficial terms. On the contrary, objectivism states that there is right and wrong that do not depend on someone’s opinions or other factors. In this sense, moral standards are believed to be propounded and everlasting, not created by humans. There are many philosophical variations and interpretations of objectivism, but the key idea lies in proclaiming one genuine truth. This evidently opposes the concept of relativism in every aspect (Bush and Moss, 2020). Objectivism, however, admits that some moral norms may change, but at thy core, any rules and standards evolve around an unaltered understanding of bad and good. I find relativism more convincing despite some flaws it contains. Although absolute relativity often signals the absence of a moral and ethical core and is thus unreliable, the theory of relativism has more realistic features. Every day we face elections, the result of which often cannot be called correct or not. Most people, in principle, always try to act ethically, but even then, their actions can be perceived negatively. You will not please everyone precisely because, despite some existing ideas about good and evil, you make decisions that pass through the prism of experience, psychological characteristics of a person, circumstances, and weighing many factors. I find objectivism too utopian an ultimatum, which seeks to simplify morality while threatening it with a distorted view of reality.",
    "Cryptocurrencies are a controversial topic in society, as their volatility puts their long-term validity into question. However, older blockchain coins have failed to deliver a scalable and secure currency that will be as decentralized as possible (Hamilton, 2022). Unlike Bitcoin and Etherium, Solana has multiple advantages that make it a worthwhile investment. For this proposal, I would like to highlight the benefits of this cryptocurrency to a business university graduate. Solana is not the newest cryptocurrency, yet it is one with the highest potential. Other blockchains possess a small capacity for transactions, as their operations per second make them unfeasible (Locke, 2021). However, this currency transfers faster and has incomparably small transaction fees (Farrington, 2021). An investment in Solana is a safer choice among cryptocurrencies, yet it has the potential to multiply one’s savings. Safety and speed of transactions are the reasons behind the high chances for future widespread usage of Solana (Hamilton, 2022). My proposed idea is to capitalize on Solana’s recent success on the market, as this currency was up 12000% in the past year (Locke, 2021). I think that this subject deserves more attention, as cryptocurrencies provide a unique take on financial interactions, yet their current state disallows companies to utilize them efficiently. Solana has the potential to overcome these barriers and turn into a globally accepted currency. In conclusion, Solana is a cryptocurrency that is worth one’s attention, as it has several benefits that make it a better choice for investment than other similar coins. Its current solid position on the market and strong backing from a cryptocurrency community is a perfect indication of future prospects. It might be necessary to analyze Solana’s carbon footprint to prove its potential for a long-term success.",
    "Yoga is a concept that signifies a set of spiritual, mental, and physical practices aimed at managing the cognitive and physiological functions of the body. Practicing this sport allows one to broaden the horizons, change the habitual way of life, and eliminate harmful patterns that negate the efforts. That is why yoga is considered the most effective practice of self-development that has unique benefits for health, both physical and psychological. There are numerous varieties of modern yoga; despite the dissimilarities, they are grounded on shared parts: body postures, breathing exercises, and spiritual contemplation. The combination of exercises that train the body and soul has unique health benefits. It strengthens muscles, increases flexibility, and enhances mental soundness. Moreover, yoga classes have enormous therapeutic potential and preventive effects. Studies involving patients with various musculoskeletal conditions have indicated that yoga helps to reduce pain and improve joint mobility (Saeed et al., 2019). Breathing exercises relax the muscles that constrict the airways and strengthen oxygen diffusion, leading to better lung function. One of the chief yoga concepts is the “eight limbs,” which consists of alternating stages for achieving a state of enlightenment. Eight steps are a prerequisite for everyone to feel connected to the world. Through these practices, one learns to control one’s actions, accept all hardships calmly, and find compromises. The ultimate goal of the methodology is to learn to find a balance between one’s own and the world’s values and understand that each person has an essential mission in the community. It significantly affects an individual’s social well-being as it seeks to bring body, mind, and soul into unison (Saeed et al., 2019). The balance of these essential elements ensures a healthy and harmonious personality, activates energy potential, and prevents psychological stress. In conclusion, yoga is essential for promoting health and combating social isolation and depression. It can be used for physical development, healing, and emotional restoration. Yoga is based on a holistic approach that helps the whole body return to a normal state. It makes it an indispensable and beneficial self-development practice for the health of both adults and children.",
    "Theodor Adorno’s concept of industrial culture implied a strong connection between capitalist society and the products capitalism produces in the cultural sphere to enhance the existing social practices that benefit the further development of capitalism. Therefore, Adorno suggested that most media products, such as films, books, television programs, reinforce the population’s belief in capitalist values. On the other hand, the structural functionalism theory approaches society as a living organism, where each part of society plays its function in the viability maintenance of the whole organism. Therefore, even though the concepts have similarities in equally prioritizing the importance of stability in society, their differences can be more apparent through application to modern culture and society. In his theory, Adorno pointed at the obvious narrative of mass media products, such as films and books, where wealth is often associated with happiness. However, another example with a more apparent connection to reinforcing capitalism is entertainment for children. From a very young age, modern children are exposed to different sorts of media in the form of tv shows, cartoons, and animated films. In the structural functionalism approach, the entertainment industry for children presents a source of education and emotional development. In different forms, the children’s entertainment industry teaches them important moral practices of being kind and polite to other people, which serves as the foundation for security in the future society. However, in the industrial culture approach, modern children’s entertainment is focused on selling the merchandise of different characters featured in films. For example, one of the most influential companies, Disney, invented the business model of using cartoon characters to attract children to their theme parks (Clement, 2018). Now, the company strategically plans simultaneous launches of animated films and merchandise with the films’ characters to ensure financial benefit.",
    "Archetypes describe such characteristics, which are universal patterns that define certain events, objects, or people. In literature, they describe representations and concepts that are common to all people, which allow people to understand and interpret stories. However, archetypes also exist in everyday life and play a significant role in shaping the perception of the world around them. In particular, there are archetypes of people that help determine their character and actions, as well as motivation. Applying this concept to everyday life, one can single out special types of people who have a set of common and exclusive characteristics for them. They are formed both on the basis of the actions and inclinations of the person and depending on the environment. An example of an archetype in everyday life is the head of a large modern corporation, such as Elon Musk. He can be defined as a hero or creator who has the inspiration and courage to change the world around him. Other people perceive it in this way, which makes it a great example of an archetype. All his actions are motivated precisely by these characteristics, and his primary motivation is the transformation of the world. The presence of archetypes in everyday life allows me to compose a more comprehensive perception of people and events. In particular, based on the characteristics I know, I can determine the motivation and role of a certain person, which makes him more predictable. This is certainly more difficult than may be presented in the literature because people often have mixed features. However, in general, the concept of archetypes gives me the opportunity to understand the actions of people and their characters. I can later use this information to form my own relationship with them.",
    "Introduction The shifts in attitudes of people towards romantic relationships and, more specifically, marriage are attributes of societal development. From this perspective, the trends common for Gen Z are incredibly informative and, therefore, used for analyzing the situation in this area (Klein, 2022). It is clear that individuals’ mindsets are formed under the influence of external circumstances, which implies the correlation of opinions about love and sex with the presence of threats to personal well-being. Hence, one cannot examine the accompanying phenomena and cause-and-effect relationships while neglecting either the human factor or the conditions of the environment. One of the articles devoted to the subject is “Are Gen Z more pragmatic about love and sex?” and its critical analysis can reveal the elements of effective writing intended for considering complex events. Summary of the Article In the selected piece, Jessica Klein narrates the tendency for representatives of Gen Z to postpone marriage and avoid long-term relationships while prioritizing personal issues. Compared to previous generations, these individuals do not view this area as a natural condition for entering adulthood due to a number of reasons. First, the advantages of single life are more attractive than settling down and help them satisfy their need for introspection (Klein, 2022). Second, people in this group adopt a pragmatic approach to the matter because they understand the necessity of gaining stability in life in order to have a family (Klein, 2022). Third, Gen Zers face more problems than their parents due to the pandemic and prefer to reflect on the kind of person they want to be partners with and choose them carefully (Klein, 2022). As a result, the processes in this area slow down significantly, and the primary focus on self, as opposed to interactions with others, justify the changes which happened to this part of human life. Response Evidence The examined article is an effective piece of writing due to the inclusion of evidence from numerous sources, both of qualitative and quantitative nature. Thus, Klein (2022) refers to multiple studies related to the subject under consideration, including surveys conducted among the target population and statistical data gathered by official institutions. More importantly, she analyzes the current tendencies in the relationships of Gen Z through the lens of the experience of previous generations (Klein, 2022). This approach to the task makes the findings more credible compared to a possible orientation on the information received from the participants and, consequently, confirms the reliability of conclusions for conducting further research. The overall extensiveness of this publication is also supported by the inclusion of personal opinions alongside the studies mentioned above (Klein, 2022). In this way, the selection of appropriate instruments for the purposes of this article is one of its main advantages. External and Internal Factors",
    "From 2016 to 2018, this study summarizes sport fisheries in the Anchorage Management Area. They contained a description and historical background of each sport fishery, as well as information on how each fishery is now managed, as well as performance and escapement data for 2016–2018. According to the report, reductions in the number and size of fish available for release in locally stocked lakes have had a detrimental impact on local fisheries’ popularity and productivity. It should be mentioned that because this source gives statistical data, it may be trusted. All of this will surely be beneficial to the study, as official data must be considered. The sport fisheries in the North Gulf Coast Management Area are discussed in this study. A summary and overview of each fishery are included, and information on how the fisheries are managed and fishery performance and escapement from 2016 to 2018. This report is provided by the official department that controls fishing activities in Alaska. However, it should be noted that this source can be considered reliable as it provides statistical information. All this will undoubtedly be useful for research since it is necessary to take into account official data. The intricacy of variables that restrict or encourage diversity in Alaskan fisheries, one of the world’s most important fishing locations, is examined in this case study. They looked at changes in participation and portfolio variety in Alaskan fisheries over three decades using a mix of harvest statistics and literature reviews. The four case studies looked at how fishers, fleets, and communities responded to various interconnected stressors, such as biological decreases, market and pricing dynamics, and fisheries privatization. Experts also verified this article, which is reflected in the reliability and accuracy of the information provided. It will be useful for research because it reflects current trends and factors affecting the spread of sport fishing.",
    "Deductive reasoning involves the construction and development of cause-and-effect solid relationships. It is noteworthy that the connection is established either between two facts or a point and the idea of how it will affect the future (Besnard & Hunter, 2018). Thus, a judgment (logical expression) includes the first – the prerequisites, the second – the conclusion. In logic, an argument is valid only when it has a form that makes it impossible for the premises to be correct and the judgment to be wrong. According to the explained three types of deductive arguments, a valid statement does not need to have actually trustworthy premises. Still, it must have ones that, if they were accurate, would guarantee that the conclusion is proper. Example:  1. All metals are heavy  2. Tin is a metal  3. Tin is heavy A sound argument must have both a valid form and true premises. Valid arguments can be unsound, but they will have wrong assumptions. Example:  1. All dogs are cats  2. All mice are dogs  3. All mice are cats What makes this a valid statement is not that it has trustworthy premises and a proper conclusion but the logical necessity of the judgment, given the two assumptions. The argument would be just as valid if the premises and conclusion were wrong. However, it is essential to determine that the purpose of argumentation is to establish the truth of a judgment. An invalid argument does not achieve this goal, so it cannot be considered sound (Besnard & Hunter, 2018). A sound argument has a valid form and true premises; thus, it cannot be invalid in all cases. If the argument is invalid, then the beliefs thoroughly do not matter, and, in fact, only the conclusion remains. Therefore, this means that there is no argument in this case, especially a sound one.",
    "Aristotle made a discovery fundamental to all logic by introducing variables. Thus, it was shown that logic is not just a specific doctrine of specific things or terms, but the science of the laws of syllogisms, such as modus ponens or modus tollens, expressed in variables. Studying various judgments, formal logic abstracts from their specific content, revealing a structure common to objects of different content. Syllogism is the discovery of Aristotle and is the main and most original part of his logic. In the theory of syllogisms, Aristotle defined syllogism and distinguished its types, defined working and non-working types of syllogisms, and established three figures of syllogism. I find it particularly interesting that Aristotle was the first to make reasoning methods the subject of scientific research. He introduced the methods of reasoning as integral formations and not just certain reasoning components. Everything that was done in logic before Aristotle just attempted to understand individual methods and principles without any systematization and unification into a single coherent system. Thus, such concepts as Modus ponens and Modus tollens laid the foundation for understanding the definition of the truth of thinking. Thus, I am amazed at how accurately Aristotle introduced the concepts of conclusions that approach science by the rules of inference, the laws of contradiction, and the exclusion of the third. Modern logic as an independent field of knowledge arose from such different sciences as philosophy and mathematics. Being indeed a highly advanced concept, modern logic, however, lacks some characteristic philosophical features – it is more straightforward and technical. Modern logic is often called mathematical logic, thereby emphasizing the originality of its new methods compared to those used previously. In this sense, it is of less interest for discussion because it relies on exact sciences and computer technologists and avoids ambiguity. Thus, modern logic is built on artificial language and intelligence, which in itself is rather boring compared to traditional concepts.",
    "Using innovative technologies, ADNOC is planning to apply its electronic developments in all spheres of activity and production as early as next year. An equally noteworthy example of the diversity and multifunctionality of the use of artificial intelligence is the predictive ability of computer programs. The company is developing a computer capable of processing an impressive amount of large data and suggesting strategies for the company’s actions depending on the forecast. The developers of software for ADNOC strive to build a machine that would work according to a certain theory but would be able to offer the possibility of effective data reading. That is why, within the framework of the company, a powerful program was developed not only for material processing but also for its visualization. By using more accessible visual media to convey complex information, the development makes the future and present of the company more clearly visible and intelligible. The use of computer technologies in the development of a large company is noticeable at all levels of its existence. ADNOC uses computer simulations to improve the operation of the network chain and visualize data for a clearer picture of the company’s position. All these developments are implemented in each of the branches of the company’s operation, increasing the speed of performance and the effectiveness of actions that are more beneficial. Their project to computerize and update all sorts of areas of the company’s activities should be fully implemented in 2022 (ADNOC, 2020). This underlines the firm’s commitment to anticipating and adapting to the future. The company strives to develop a forecasting model that would include the largest possible amount of statistical data. The results of big data processing show that ADNOC has significantly accelerated the speed and the number of financial transactions through its software. Based on the logic of increasing the turnover of money, one can conclude that this software improves the financial performance of the company. In addition, it should be noted that as part of the accelerated exchange of money, an innovative blockchain technology is used, which provides a permanent digital transfer of currency. The program’s ability to make smart business decisions is already reflected in its $ 1 billion worth of stocks (Arabian Business, 2020). The varied opportunities for financial enrichment brought by this program are potentially enormous.",
    "The adversarial criminal justice system is one where the law is applied equally to all segments of the society. It is a system that presumes that one is innocent that shifts the burden of proof to the prosecution to prove beyond any shadow of a doubt. The advantage lies on the side of the defendant if there is any doubt. The accused is granted the right to silence and cannot be forced to respond to accusation levelled against them. This system poses some ethical problems because most of its procedural safeguards are always in favour of the accused. The favours that are granted to the accused include the right of appeal, the right to remain silent, the right to have an attorney, and the right to be free from unauthorized searches and arrests. The rights granted to the defendant are always a disadvantage to the prosecution which has to prove its case against the accused. This position is biased against the prosecution and makes its work even more difficult. The system encourages a scenario where both entities to a case contest with each other to win a case. This scenario makes it easier vulnerable to acts of deception and legal tactics that are questionable instead of using facts to settle cases. It is a potential ethical problem that can be solved by allowing both parties to present facts before any judgment is made to avoid injustices. If a black man is found committing a similar offence like a white woman, he is five times more likely to be arrested. It is a tendency that has been brought about by racism in the American judicial system and racial inequality in policing. Moreover, the black man is more likely to be convicted than a white woman who has committed a similar crime. According to a report by the United States Sentencing Commission, a black man who is found the same crime as the white man have a potential of receiving nearly 20% longer prison term (Ingraham, 2017). These disparities are due to cases of racism and bias found within the American criminal justice system.",
    "When learning about religions and philosophies, I find that origins or backgrounds are essential in interpreting the context and content of a religion. For Jainism, it was vital to learn that it is substantially older than a more well-known and contemporary Sikhism. Though both have close ties with Hinduism, Sihkism’s origins date back to only about 500 years ago while Jainism has a history of nearly 2500 years (Molloy 191). Sikhism exhibits a more militaristic approach to monotheism despite being more modern. As such, the Jainist belief that no Creator exists and that the universe is simply guided by natural forces becomes especially interesting as it rejects a very traditional integration of deities into theology. Following this, it is also interesting to me to observe in what ways a religion interacts with the world through its perspective. As mentioned above, Jainism rejects the belief in a Creator or God. This belief is held up by several philosophical questions that are even asked in atheistic circles. These include contradictions in typical monotheistic religions such as God being both perfect and creating an imperfect world or God loving all life but still allowing suffering. Jainism even poses a logical fallacy, which suggests that if everything in the universe had to be created, would God not also need to be created? This worldview is surprisingly modern and potentially controversial for its time. Ethics is another vital component of any philosophy or belief system. Jainism establishes five distinct principles of ethics which are Ahimsa (non-violence), Satya (truth), Astheya (non-stealing), Brahmacharya (chastity), and Aparigraha (non-possession). I am especially interested in Ahimsa which is the core of Jainist ethics. This is because I believe that many religions excuse violence due to their beliefs, which is inherently immoral to my values. Jainism proposes that non-violence is a priority and therefore inexcusable.",
    "It is important to note that it is highly common for one culture not to be able to understand the state, internal struggles, and intricacies of a different culture. The given notion is called ethnocentrism, where one’s perspective and views are centered around his or her own culture. For example, the book states: “people in America don’t understand, but when an American chain opens in a third-world country, people go crazy” (Noah 188). As a person living in Canada, I embody Canadian culture, where most people from developing nations might not fully understand that a mere fast food restaurant chain is not such a thrilling occurrence for regular consumers. The book also states that “Westerners are shocked and confused by that, but it’s a case of the West reaping what it has sown. The colonial powers carved Africa, put the black man to work, and did not properly educate him” (Noah 194). Similarly, many assume that Canadian people are excessively polite as part of the culture, but I would want others to know that it is not the case. One of the most interesting aspects of the book is how certain tyrants are not perceived as such in other places due to the lack of their relevance, which is why it is true for current leaders in Canada as well. The text states: “so in Europe and America, yes, Hitler is the Greatest Madman in History, In Africa, he’s just another strongman from history books” (Noah 196). Although Canada did not have such tyrants, many people outside Canada perceive that our leaders are perfect and representative of true democracy. However, it is not always true because they also face challenges for power struggles and do not always behave in the nation’s best interests, which are becoming more evident in recent events.",
    "Globalization is the extent to which information, investments, trade, political cooperation, cultural values, and social ideas flow among different countries. It is creating a borderless world for managers by allowing them to conduct their operations internationally rather than locally, hire employees from different countries, buy raw materials from the best sources, and sell goods in various markets (Samson et al., 2020). Although the borderless world presents many opportunities to managers, it also entails risks, such as information security and cultural differences. A global mindset is a manager’s ability to recognize and influence people or organizations that have different cultural, social, political, and psychological backgrounds (Samson et al., 2020). It has become imperative for international companies because managers constantly interact with individuals with different perspectives. To ensure effective operations and collaboration, managers should be able to understand these perspectives instead of sticking to a worldview prevalent in their home country. The international landscape is changing since China, India, and Brazil demonstrate economic growth and play an important role in global business. For example, China has received more foreign investments than any other place and has increased its number of Fortune Global 500 companies from 16 in 2005 to 98 in 2015 (Samson et al., 2020). While China is growing through manufacturing, India develops economically through services, software design, and precision engineering. A multinational corporation (MNC) is a company, with more than 25% of revenues which come from operations in countries other than the home country of the parent organization (Samson et al., 2020). MNCs are characterized by close cooperation among affiliates in different countries and a single management authority making key decisions for the parent company and all affiliates (Samson et al., 2020). Additionally, MNC managers have a global perspective, viewing the whole world as one market. Outsourcing refers to participating in a global division of labor that enables companies to complete certain activities in locations with the cheapest raw materials and labor (Samson et al., 2020). Exporting is an entry strategy in which the company’s production facilities remain in the home country, while produced goods are transferred to other countries for sale. Licensing is an entry strategy in which the company in one country gives firms in other countries access to specific resources, such as technology or trademark rights, to produce and sell its products abroad (Samson et al., 2020). Direct investing is an entry strategy where the company manages its production facilities in another country.",
    "This study’s independent variable was a helpful message on the back of the dining check regarding the upcoming specials. The dependent variable was the percentage of the bill left as a tip to the waiter. This study operationalizes the restaurant tipping culture by focusing on the tip percentage. The potential confounding variables of this experiment may be the food quality, the server’s gender, the dining party’s size, and whether the customers were regulars. The study’s strengths include design transparency, implementation simplicity, and potential replication in different settings. However, the message’s content varied depending on the special, appealing differently to customers. Furthermore, the study was conducted only in one restaurant, which renders extrapolation to different establishment classes difficult. These factors could impact the tipping outcomes and, therefore, the study results. Furthermore, it is unclear whether the mere presence of a personalized message or the message content itself drove the outcome. To evaluate this possibility, the authors could have asked waiters to write different messages, some with no useful content, such as wishing a good day or drawing a smiley face. Moreover, the researchers could have used alternative arrangements, assigning the waiters randomly instead of assigning dining parties randomly. Several aspects of this study could impact its internal validity. The researchers have instructed servers to keep their behavior consistent, thus limiting potential confounding variables. Varying attitudes may affect the final tip, thus undermining the causal relationship. Furthermore, a few hypothetical aspects could limit the research’s external validity. For instance, if the waiter were a young female adult, applying the same conclusions to male waiters and older servers would be challenging, given the potential gender factor. If the study was conducted at a private country club, extrapolating the result onto the high-class restaurant and casual diners alike would be unreliable. If the meal was buffet-style, the overall tipping percentage might have been lower due to the perceived lesser effort of a waiter, thus impacting its wider applicability. Lastly, the study only used two groups, servers, and dining parties, with no size specification. The authors could have employed a third group of solo dining parties, thus separating groups from those dining by themselves. Such an addition would allow addressing the question of the groups’ size effect and individual, interpersonal interactions. Lastly, implementing the design with solo dining parties would address the effect of gender on the outcome.",
    "As apparent from the title, the focus of the article “Positive leadership psychology: Authentic and servant leadership in higher education in Pakistan” is the Pakistani educational system, whose organization the authors analyze through the lens of leadership. Specifically, they examine the role of centralized guidance in the learning process and speculate on which style can influence its participants in the most favorable ways. In particular, the piece highlights the importance of relationships of trust in education. According to the authors, any suppressive hierarchy, strict subordination, or an atmosphere of complete obedience prevents people from openness, becoming a serious obstacle to social exchange. The latter is seen as the foundation of productive teamwork and presupposes an awareness of the other’s feelings as well as motives for searching for the most appropriate behavioral patterns. Therefore, within Bloom’s taxonomy, more precisely, its cognitive domain, the article describes the knowledge, the primary level. The publication is quite coherent and well-structured, which marks its appropriate quality. Notably, the outcomes of the analysis appear in an understandable form and actually serve to illustrate the theoretical background, in which part the authors comment on the essentiality of proper leadership in organizations. The practical part involves a detailed examination of several types and styles, specifically, the ways various leaders interact with employees. The general conclusion is the criticality of mutual respect and dedication to recognizing everybody’s needs, which underlies servant leadership as a practice. Human resources and psychology of leadership apparently are the areas where the investigators specialize. Notably, they participated in a range of publications on several topics within the above fields, such as organizational leadership, individual leadership, culture-specific peculiarities, and others. As mentioned, Current Psychology, the global peer-reviewed research forum, accepted their work for publishing, which means that it meets its quite specific quality requirements. It was found through the JFL, Jerry Falwell Library.",
    "Various cultures around the world have unique creation myths and traditional methods of presenting them through art. The cosmology of the Aztec civilization was quite different from the Europeans that conquered them. Firstly, the Europeans’ Christian God “created mankind in his own image” and granted him dominion over a perfectly constructed world, the Garden of Eden (Holy Bible, New International Version, Genesis 1:27). In the Bible, he is described as a benevolent, if strict, father figure who can forgive humankind their sins and grant them eternal redemption. Consequently, God is depicted in art as a wise, older man with a beard and white hair. Christian art primarily praises the power of His forgiveness and the bountiful nature that He created. In contrast, Aztec creation stories are based on dismembered gods, and thus the origin of the world is catastrophic violence, which explains why Aztec art depicts divinity as gruesome and awe-inspiring (National University, 2022). Their art functions as a warning and an order to obey. They demand blood in exchange for food, and each sculpture of the gods in Aztec culture contains a receptacle for human hearts (National University, 2022). Unlike Christianity, the central figure is a female goddess, but similarly to Eve, she is primarily a passive player whom the other gods punish. Furthermore, Coatlique’s choice to give birth a second time against her children’s wishes could also be interpreted as the Aztec version of Eve’s sin of disobedience. Both Aztec and Christian gods are described as perfect and self-contained. However, in the Aztec mythos, gods are above the concepts of good and evil, while in the Christian order evil is considered the dominion of Satan and the opposite of God. Therefore, Aztecs have to appease a bloodthirsty, violent goddess to receive food and survive. On the other hand, Christians have to reject sin and submit their spirit to God to gain eternal salvation. Ultimately, the Christian creation story is based on forgiveness and love compared to the Aztecs’ survival through violence, and this difference is reflected in their opposing art styles.",
    "The concept of nursing is closely associated with the idea of continuous improvement, as the trends of health care need to mirror the existing social trends to provide the best care possible. One way to secure such care is to refer to the latest scholarly findings to modify the approaches to care provision in the workplace. This process of implementing research-based findings in daily patient care is known as evidence-based practice (EBP) (Wilson & Austria, 2021). Currently, EBP is not used actively by nurses for several reasons. First, the workload of most nurses discourages their desire to learn and embrace EBP. According to McArthur et al. (2021), a physical opportunity is a construct that contributes to the nurses’ ability to resort to EBM. Physical opportunity includes such barriers as “cost and lack of resources, compromised communication, staff turnover, and limited physical guidelines” (McArthur et al., 2021, p. 20). As a result, management promotes behavioral patterns that react to the environment rather than examine it in advance. The second massive barrier to EBP in the workplace is the lack of social opportunity embodied in the lack of organizational support and teamwork (McArthur et al., 2021). Since the aforementioned examples tackle only a minor part of the existing challenged, the need to intervene and facilitate EBP is evident. The first commonly mentioned approach to facilitate the use of EBP is to establish a leadership that would encourage the practice by both setting an example and conducting training and workshops. Another crucial facilitator is to secure nurses’ access to relevant sources in the workplace, including relevant databases, steady Internet connection, and subscription to peer-reviewed publications. In such a way, the use of scholarly research will become more time-efficient and less stressful for nurses.",
    "It goes without saying that Beowulf may be regarded as one of the most prominent ancient European poems. Although its origin remains the subject of multiple discussions, the common version describes it as “a Danish poem in the Anglo-Saxon dialect” (Neidorf 847). The poem describes the glorious life and deeds of a hero, Beowulf, who was regarded as a person sent by heaven for people (Gummere line 13). Helping Hrothgar, king of the Danes, he kills the monster Grendel and his mother. Later, when he becomes the king of Danes by himself, he has to fight a dragon that terrorizes his lands. Although he follows the beast and finally slays it, Beowulf dies, being mortally wounded. From a personal perspective, this poem reflects several essential aspects of human life. The first one is the issue of identity – in Beowulf , people were entirely associated with the glory of their ancestors. They do not exist independently from their family lineage and kinship bonds. Thus, their desire of Beowulf to be recognizable and honored forces him to search for deeds and fame. Thus, another important theme of the poem is the maturity and responsibility that come with age. At the beginning of the poem, the main hero desires personal glory and has nothing to lose. However, after becoming a king, he realizes the importance of being a wise ruler who is responsible for his people’s lives. Finally, one more topic of the poem is the tension between personal value systems and the heroic code and between Christian and pagan values. It may be regarded as an example of the multifacetedness and complexity of human nature in comparison with fixed rules that frequently do not provide appropriate answers.",
    "Beowulf is an Anglo-Saxon epic poem set in Jutland before the Angles migrated to Britain. The title of this literary work is the name of the main character (Hall 2). Beowulf became one of the revered heroes in Old English literature, and the poem itself had a strong influence on pop culture. This epic character, who accepts his fate without hesitation, attracts attention in modern times full of doubts and contradictions with his almost archetypal clarity and wholeness. Indeed, for example, it can be assumed that modern superhero comics are particularly popular, partly because people still need the image of a fair, superpowered being. One of the most popular heroes of the Marvel Universe is Superman. Their similarities with Beowulf are obvious – both have incredible strength and are role models for the people of their time (Burn 107). These heroes have to overcome obstacles to help those who need support. In both universes, strength and extreme physical abilities become objects of praise and reverence. In addition, a key factor contributing to the plot of the heroes’ destinies is the presence of an enemy, on whose destruction depends the survival of the world. However, the fundamental difference is that a hero’s physical strength is not enough to admire him for modern people. This characteristic must be complemented by the purity of thought and good intentions. The hero becomes much more complex as the modern world gets more sophisticated. The fact that people still draw inspiration from old stories correlates with the tenets of postmodernist theory. According to the latter, it is necessary to constantly reproduce what has passed, make sense of it, and experiment with its content. It can be seen that stories about legendary superheroes remain relevant to contemporary viewers, readers, and audiences in general. As in Saxon times, bravery and loyalty are revered, and having these characteristics is what makes an individual a role model.",
    "There are multiple factors that stand behind the successful implementation of the P-O-L-C framework. It is important to prioritize some of them duly in case a company faces serious issues, or when the market indicates upcoming challenges. The collapse of WorldCom in 2002, that led to one of the largest accounting scandals in the US, provides a nice example of the lack of proper communication in a corporation. The inability of various top managers and accountants to communicate efficiently in order to prevent frauds is always disastrous. WorldCom grew rapidly under Bernard Ebbers who managed to jump at the multiple opportunities that the growing interest for telecom services provided at that time. Nevertheless, the company went bankrupt in a matter of a few years. Moreover, Ebbers faced several charges, including one count of conspiracy, one count of securities fraud and seven counts of filing false statements with securities regulators. The fact that the large portion of Ebber’s wealth was in WorldCom stocks, let alone several loans and loan guarantees from the company, was also scrutinized. The top managers of the company faced numerous charges and started to testify against each other. Moreover, Ebbers and his subordinates alike claimed to know nothing of the fraudulent schemes. According to Knecht (2020), up to 80% of employees generally believe that their opinions are not taken into account. Therefore, the major factor that led to the collapse of the telecom giant was the diminished quality of communication within the company. The reasons for all the misunderstanding and complicated series of negotiations between Ebbers, directors and accountants are rooted in barriers to communication that include motive distortion and extreme self-absorption. The top managers and professionals who were expected to lead the company tended to prioritize their own interests and receive only the parts of information and data that was convenient to them. Thus, the atmosphere created by such an attitude eventually led to the collapse of the corporation, as a result of the lack of decently organized teamwork.",
    "The Bhagavad Gita is an ancient Indian scripture that consists of 700 verses and is part of the larger epic Mahabharata. This book is one of the central holy scriptures of Hinduism and dates from the second half of the first millennium BC. e. The plot of the Gita unfolds within the framework of a conversation between Arjuna, the prince of the Pandavas, and Krishna, his guide, charioteer, and the supreme God incarnate. Krishna prompts Arjuna’s behavior patterns and helps to solve some moral expectations. The latter is connected with the need for the Pandavas to fight against the Kauravas. This paper aims to reflect on the Bhagavad Gita , one of the most outstanding books of the Indian epic. Arjuna exhibits characteristic traits, such as self-confidence, arrogance, pride. Arjuna demonstrates outstanding martial skills and is one of the best warriors. Krishna is the personification of the Supreme God and his traits include wisdom, humility, knowledge, and benevolence. The two characters have a close relationship: “Then, Madhava (Krishna) and the son of Pandu (Arjuna), stationed in their magnificent chariot with white horses yoked to it, loudly blew their divine conchs” (“Bhagavad Gita,” 2021, p. 13). Other characters are the Kaurava king Dhritarashtra and his adviser Sanjaya, secondary characters. The purpose of the author of the epic was to tell about the battle of Kurukshetra, where two Indian armies gathered to fight until the final victory. Arjuna asks Krishna to drive up to the center of the battlefield and finds those who will participate and those who want war – his relatives, friends, and teachers. Arjuna feels betrayed as he doesn’t want to fight and kill them. Full of doubt, he drops his bow and asks his charioteer Krishna many questions about the reasons for the war, the possibility of renouncing the battle, the correctness of his action, and ethical dilemmas. Thus, the reflection on the Bhagavad Gita, one of the most outstanding books of the Indian epic, was provided. The book is relevant, as it reveals eternal themes – morality, justice, a sense of duty, a feeling of love for one’s neighbor. The philosophical dialogue between Arjuna and Krishna touches on the most challenging ethical topics that apply to both war and peace. The characters discuss identity crisis, the purpose of life, the human self, and human temperament.",
    "The TED Talks are illustrations of bio-psycho-social-spiritual developmental issues which ultimately create circumstances in which certain people do not feel fully included in society. For example, Smith (2015) refers to the differences correlating with raising a white and a black child. Abdel-Magied (2014), on the other hand, exemplifies how a piece of clothing changes the way people treat, view, and evaluate Muslim women. It is certain that discrimination starts with bias, which is a layered concept. An article published by New York Times (2016) refers to the experiences of non-white people in the US, which often correlate with the lack of feeling of inclusion. This is also perpetrated by bias, which creates specific overviews in which people tend to favor a group of people over another one. The bias may be automatic, ambiguous, and ambivalent depending on its characteristics and how it manifests in terms of people’s opinions on certain groups of individuals (Fiske, 2022). While such incidents have never been personally experienced, it is certain that the lives of people I know have been affected in terms of self-esteem and confidence, which can often be negatively impacted because of discrimination. I would like to explore racial bias due to its relevance in today’s day and age, namely how it manifests on structural levels.",
    "The film “Coded Bias” provides comprehensive information regarding the problems related to facial recognition algorithms, determining several sources of bias. They primarily include the original orientation of creators on white faces, leading to the lack of data regarding dark complexion and the prevalence of prejudiced male developers. These conditions do not allow establishing equality in terms of race and gender and seem to present a significant threat to the field stemming from the failure to meet everyone’s needs. In addition, the lack of knowledge of how the programs process data and make conclusions does not help eliminate the risks. In turn, the possible ways of reducing this type of bias attributed to present-day facial recognition algorithms are to prevent their implementation in legal proceedings and police activity in general and introduce practical improvements. The former means accepting responsibility for decisions, and the latter suggestion is multi-faceted and should begin with updating databases to increase their variety and conducting independent assessments to confirm efficiency. By adopting these measures, bias based on race and gender can be addressed over time, and the appropriate quality of operations can be guaranteed. The mentioned ideas seem crucial for promoting proper use of technology; however, they can not only increase the precision of programs but also resolve the challenge concerning surveillance and racialized minorities. This standpoint is based on the above consideration, according to which accountability for decisions should be clearly established. This change can be performed if the algorithms work correctly, and minimizing or eliminating bias, in this case, is possible if internal and external evaluations correlate with each other. In this way, the future of this field in terms of its suitability for investigations is conditional upon the efforts of specialists in resolving the existing issues to address major concerns of Nakamura and Browne.",
    "The Caribbean history includes the ruthless colonization by Western countries like Spain. Upon colonization, the area was home to native groups such as the Ciboney or Guanahuatebey, Taino Arawak, and Carib. The colonizers brought a bunch of enslaved Africans who would work in their homes and plantations. The Whites were the minority and foreigners in the Caribbean but brutally seized and ruled against the Blacks majority. However, the Blacks maintained their identity and self-expression through various cultural activities evident to date. The Caribbean is the home for many musical genres expressing human freedom and revolution. Reggae is associated with the Caribbean people, and it is the unofficial soundtrack of many Caribbean vacations. Reggae musicians such as Bob Marley and the Wailers produced revolutionary and redemptions songs protesting against the White brutal rule in the Caribbean. Therefore, through Reggae, the Caribbean people expressed their anger against the ruthless White control. The majority African population in the Caribbean identified themselves with their cuisines and customs, including religious beliefs. The enslaved people maintained their African culinary art and cherished their cuisines. For instance, the Callaloo, the Caribbean vegetable soup, is one of the national dishes in Tobago and Trinidad. Furthermore, carnivores and parades are serious business in the area. The Caribbean parades manifest the area’s folklores and customs of African origin. The Caribbean people commemorate events in history like slavery through carnivals. The distinct African heritage in the Caribbean helped in identifying the Blacks. The Caribbean was colonized by the whites, who were the minority of the area’s population. The colonizers brought Africans who worked in their homes and plantations under the fierce rule. However, the enslaved people and the Blacks in the area expressed and identified themselves through music and distinct African heritage. Reggae songs helped the Blacks protest against the pitiless white rule, and events such as the parades and carnivals commemorated slavery. Furthermore, African cuisines such as Callaloo identified Africanism in the Caribbean. Despite the brutal rule by the White minority, the Blacks in the Caribbean expressed and identified themselves through songs and events that are evident to date.",
    "Society has always been a fundamental institution influencing the development of states. Communicating in groups, people share values, views, and responses to a particular phenomenon. Interaction in communities or clubs cultivates a public attitude to multiple events, forms a lifestyle, and influences politics. For this reason, the changes in civic life are significant for states. Putnam, in his essay “Bowling Alone,” also emphasizes this idea, saying that the social life of the USA collapses, and it is difficult to predict the results of this process. Active engagement in social processes has always been one of the major features peculiar to the country, but the situation has changed. Putnam says that “tens of millions of Americans had forsaken their parents’ habitual readiness to engage in the simplest act of citizenship” (67). It means that people have started to alter their lifestyles, shifting towards isolation and detachment, which is not typical for U.S. society. Furthermore, traditional organizations, such as clubs, are replaced by new mass membership organizations. Putnam says they have more political importance and might impact the country; however, they do not promote civic engagement. “For the vast majority of their members, the only act of membership consists in writing a check for dues or perhaps occasionally reading a newsletter” (Putnam 70). This line shows that Putnam is worried about the continuous process of disconnecting community members, who become divided and disengaged. From a long-term perspective, it might result in the collapse of civic life. The results cannot be predicted as the USA has always been a state with strong community relations. That is why Putnam says that if nothing changes, we will bowl alone, isolated from others.",
    "One of the most critical factors of breast cancer development is heredity since it causes a genetically inherent disease. If the patient’s closest relatives have been diagnosed with breast cancer, a tumor’s likelihood is high even at a young age (Coleman & Tsongalis, 2016). Since one of the patient’s close relatives had this disease, this diagnosis is indeed possible for her as well. Another significant factor in developing cancer is various diseases of the mammary glands, for example, “cystic” breasts. In the presence of such conditions, the formation of atypical cells is possible in the mammary gland (Tkaczuk et al., 2016). This can lead to their overgrowth and increase the risk of more severe diseases. The hormonal factor also has a critical influence on health. In the described case, this aspect is the most significant since it includes various details of the patient’s life. These include the first pregnancy after 30 years, not breastfeeding, and many years of taking hormonal contraceptives. This leads to the fact that the patient’s hormonal background can be disrupted (Tkaczuk et al., 2016). Therefore, with age, it becomes more difficult for the body to deal with abnormal processes. If there is an initial stage of cancer, there can be no metastasis in the patient’s organs. However, early active metastasis is characteristic of aggressive forms of cancer. There are multiple ways to determine them, and it is necessary to use some of them in any case to avoid future health problems. Histological analysis of tissue can determine the aggressiveness of the cancer type at an early stage. Breast cancer metastases detected by CT or scintigraphy indicate secondary foci in the lungs, liver, bones, and brain. It must be remembered that in breast cancer, metastases are capable of long-term existence in a latent state, even five to ten years after removal of the primary tumor.",
    "International labor laws prohibit making employment decisions regarding individuals’ age and disabilities. It means that Etihad Airways infringed on the existing regulations by introducing its approach to layoff. Considering the fact that social justice is a central demand for multinational corporations, Etihad’s conduct can be viewed as unethical and irrelevant. The more significant employee involvement in the decision-making process could have helped to avoid this situation. It directly influences performance and guarantees that fair decisions considering the workers’ input are made. Thus, Etihad attained success in compensating employees for their contribution and work. Payment processing is a critical factor influencing job security and employees’ motivation, meaning that this decision helps Etihad to generate benefits and rehire them in the future. From the case, one can also see that reduction in job security was a critical factor associated with the change process in Etihad. The decision to fire workers resulted in a lack of confidence among specialists and reduced their motivation and long-term plans in the corporation. For this reason, it is critical to secure employee positions to ensure individuals are engaged and fulfill their duties effectively. Discrimination was another factor peculiar to the change process at Etihad Airways. The corporation disregarded the corporate social responsibility issues, which resulted in the growth of dissatisfaction, lack of motivation, and engagement. It means that the company ignored possible alternatives that could have been used instead of its discriminative practices undermining job security and individuals’ readiness to work with such entities. Altogether, the case shows that lack of employee involvement was one of the fundamental issues in the case. The company’s top management made changes with minimal employee involvement. It resulted in creating an unpopular and ineffective strategy that cultivated dissatisfaction among workers. Etihad Airways ignored employees’ need for self-actualization, decreasing their motivation. The remaining workers did not feel their importance to the corporation and the power to influence its development. It demonstrates that modern workers should be provided with the chance to participate in corporate decision-making to realize their significance and become motivated. Trying to manage the wage bill, Etihad Airways accepted the wrong decision, viewing layoff as the only possible option. The choice of disability and age as criteria for decision-making infringed on the existing labor laws. Moreover, it undermined job security as employees realized their vulnerable position. Outcomes prove the low effectiveness of this strategy. Regarding the absence of available manpower, the remaining employees started to suffer from burnout because of the high level of stress. Moreover, the lack of motivation and engagement because of the processes mentioned above influenced their performance. As a result, Etihad Airways’ ability to achieve existing objectives was hindered. The case proves the critical importance of employee involvement in decision-making during the change process as it helps to motivate them and select the most acceptable options.",
    "Every business must be managed carefully, and every detail must receive a fair amount of attention. When it comes to healthcare, such facilities must require even more attention because they focus on people’s well-being. Performing such duties might be strenuous and expensive, and mentally demanding. As a Chief Nursing Officer, one will be faced with principles that include integrity maintenance, cash flow management, and employee motivation in the given circumstances. To start with, a healthcare business must always maintain its integrity. It can be evident that any business field should be focused on communication, which makes integrity a vital part (Fisher, 2008). In the given facility, the integrity maintenance principle is heavily adhered to. First of all, every doctor follows an ethical code, meaning that they know of doctor-patient confidentiality. Moreover, doctors and nurses focus on honest communication with patients. For example, in my situation, I tell patients about their actual conditions and honestly answer their questions. Another important business principle is proper cash flow management. Healthcare facility requires renovations and innovations, meaning that there will constantly be situations when new equipment or repairs will be needed (Mason et al., 2020). In this situation, it is highly necessary to implement the needed changes to not jeopardize patients’ health and well-being. For example, as a CNO, it was my obligation to manage the replacement of power generators. As a result, generators enabled the personnel to carry out their duty without problems during a storm and power outage. The last principle is the management of employees and providing them with motivation. In the case of a healthcare facility, it is essential that the employees are rewarded and their hard work is appreciated. The employees are offered extra days off and gift cards in the given facility. This can make the workers feel heard and supported. Without these steps, the nurses and doctors will have burnout and lose the desire to provide high-quality results. Thus, the given principles were chosen due to the impact they can bring on employees and patients. The mentioned principles are being used, providing good results and leading to the satisfaction of all parties. These principles are important to me since I believe that healthcare should be based on these values. Otherwise, no facility will be able to treat their patients, and there will be no trust and respect between healthcare personnel and patients.",
    "The nature of mythology and its persistence in culture throughout thousands of years has long fascinated scholars and thinkers. Joseph Campbell’s book entitled The hero with a thousand faces investigates this issue in detail to reveal how myth as a psychologically informed phenomenon predetermines cultural patterns of humanity. In this paper, the first chapter of the book, “Myth and dream,” will be at the center of the discussion. The thesis of this part might be projected through the following quote. The author states that myths “are dangerous because they threaten the fabric of the security into which we have built ourselves and our family. But they are fiendishly fascinating too, for they carry keys that open the whole realm of the desired and feared adventure of the discovery of the self” (Campbell, 2004, p. 7). Such a formulation implies that people’s minds intertwine myths and dreams as a mechanism of self-perception, understanding of the self in the context of the whole life cycle, and coping with developmental change. Myths lead people through the challenges of life and allow for integrating the conscious and subconscious into a single framework. Indeed, prior to presenting the idea in the above-mentioned quote, Campbell (2004) refers to the repetitive occurrence of the terrors and irrationalities from ancient mythology in contemporary people’s dreams. Indeed, the motifs of hatred, vanity, jealousy are intertwined with love, gratitude, and other feelings and motivations to action. In such a manner, these matters are dangerous to people because they unveil the psychological underpinnings of their subconscious in ways that contradict their rational or conscious decision-making and thinking. The author elaborates on this central idea by referring to the letters written by people about their myth-like dreams reflecting their concerns or subconscious struggles. Campbell (2004) presents an example of a young man’s dream about accidentally killing his father to obtain the full attention of his mother, which has been a recurring theme in mythology. Furthermore, the author refers to a dream of a woman who sees a half-horse-half-man individual in her dream despite any ideas of infidelity experienced consciously. In this regard, the connection between the experiences of early childhood and adulthood is essential for myths and their manifestation in dreams. This observation helps explain the second part of the quote, which states that through the contradictions of the myth-like dreams, people can understand their selves and the subconscious triggers of their emotions and behaviors.",
    "Recent fad diets have suggested that carbohydrates cause harm to one’s body. However, this statement has been refuted many times for several reasons. Firstly, to get a beautiful, efficiently functioning body, one needs nutrients – fats, proteins, carbohydrates, and water (Nazario). Carbohydrate metabolism converts carbs into vital energy for the nervous system and brain, as well as for the possibility of proper metabolism of proteins and fats. Once these elements are eliminated, there is a high risk of developing continuous fatigue, which potentially leads to depressive mood. Secondly, giving up carbohydrates leads to extra pounds because after completing a carb-free diet, the body is susceptible to every gram of carbohydrates, and super-compensation occurs in the diet. In addition to an increased appetite for carbohydrate-containing foods, the assimilation of this element increases significantly (Nazario). For example, a person was on such a diet for a month and lost ten pounds, and then immediately returned to a regular diet, regaining the same weight within a week. Thirdly, even after the first day of giving up carbohydrates, a person may feel a slight malaise and headache (Nazario). Later, there is a chance of developing constant headaches leading to migraine. Ultimately, carbohydrates are the primary source of energy for the brain. All cognitive functions slowly fade away when the main “engine” ceases to receive sufficient charge. Almost every activity demands increased brain activity which is stimulated by carbs (Nazario). When a person does not consume them, primarily the level of concentration reduces. Constant burning of ketones instead of glucose can lead to impaired brain function. Therefore, it is vital to include carbs into one’s ration in order to ensure that all bodily systems function properly.",
    "Cost of Advanced Documentation System The Advanced Documentation System is a document technology partner that helps optimize and ameliorate the work of the company’s printers. The costs spent on printers and their supply grow exponentially within years. There are various ways to improve the way printers are handled by implementing helpful services such as the Advanced Documentation System. The cost of the system depends on the brand, for instance on Capterra, the service costs $25 per month with a minimum of 5 working places which is $125 in total (Capterra, 2022). The software has a free trial period that allows the customer to understand the features of the system and its working specialties. The usage of the system can become profitable for the company within time. It is a cost-saving service as it analyzes and teaches the personnel to use various printer regimes for various needs. The software teaches the customer to use the printer on a higher level and consequently leads to better document management including converting papers to digital and re-engineering procedures for better productivity. The service successfully integrates into the IT environment of the firm and optimizes the inner work processes. Eventually, the implementation of the Advanced Documentation System can become an investment within time as it can save the time of the personnel, increase their productivity, and help the environment (Advanced Document Systems, 2022). The environmental-friendly approach is based on saving the print and the time printers are used by the personnel. Alternative Funding Sources The company can pay for the service using various financial resources for alternative funding resources. The sources usually depend on the scale of the firm, its level of income, and its current position in the market. The easiest and most accessible way to pay for Advanced Document System is from the cash flow, especially if the company has a surplus of profit. Some companies do not possess many employees and income, and they can take a bank loan to cover the costs of the system. The bank loan can also be helpful when the service is needed for many seats that have to be united and optimized. Then, the costs spent on the system increase, and extra funding might be needed. To increase the cash flow, the company can also go to the equity market and issue the stocks. The more stocks are sold to shareholders, the more cash flow the firm receives and can use for different needs. The other way to find alternative funding sources is to issue bonds that represent a fixed-income instrument. A bond is a debt obligation meaning that the company loans from an investor a specific sum of money. Bonds are safe for investors and faster to get for the company because more people invest in bonds as a safer method. Finally, the company can use mixed funding to get the cash for the payment which means uniting several methods described above. All the funding opportunities are possible for buying and implementing the Advanced Documentation System.",
    "Rolling Stones were in the shadow of the Beatles from the very beginning, and this fact disturbed them a lot. On the other hand, most of the fame went to the Beatles, and the Rolling Stones constantly felt their superiority. To be different, they tried to become the anti-Beatles. The legendary Beatles were a pioneer of hard rock: the musical influence of the song Helter Skelter led to the emergence of heavy metal (Covach and Bell 28). The influence of The Rolling Stones on the formation and development of rock music cannot be overestimated. It was significant not only in music, like the Beatles but also in artistic and visual, image and mass media terms. In songwriting development, the Rolling Stones tried hard to keep up with their competitors, but it was not easy, and they seemed to be one step behind. A lot of what they did was a reaction to what the Beatles had already done. For example, when a sitar began to sound in the Beatles’ composition, it immediately appeared in the Rolling Stones. The Beatles, with their working-class origins in provincial Liverpool, sought to maintain an elegant image (Covach and Bell 28). They dressed in decent suits, cut their hair neatly and short, and communicated politely with everyone. The Rolling Stones did the opposite: they wore black leather clothes and looked and behaved provocatively. In 1964, when The Beatles first came to the US, it was called the British invasion (Covach and Bell 28). The Beatles took all five first places in the Billboard singles chart at once and became the only ones who were able to set such a record (Covach and Bell 28). The Rolling Stones also achieved success in the US, mainly through shocking exposure, but they did not shake the Beatles’ position. Many of the rock bands of the 60s, The Beatles and The Rolling Stones, are seen as irreconcilable rivals. The reasons to think so are quite weighty: they played different music and had different images. However, both groups have influenced music around the world and have become one of the most recognizable – this is their main similarity.",
    "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic and long-term disorder characterized by uncontrollable, repeated thoughts and behaviors that an individual feels the need to repeat over and over. The case of Robert, a twenty-three-year-old young man, will be discussed further. Robert came to a mental health facility to get treated for anxiety, but it soon turned out that he rather struggled with OCD because he strongly smelled of disinfectant and reported excessive cleaning behaviors. After being in contact with surfaces and people, Robert felt a strong urge to wash his hands with bleach. He could wash his hands up to thirty times a day, which damaged his skin dramatically. However, the fear of germs was much stronger, and he could not stand touching something without washing his hands afterward. The issue of cleanliness took a great toll on his mental health. During the pandemic, the symptoms of OCD increased significantly. Robert reported wearing a HAZMAT suit outside, afraid of contracting the virus. In his social life, Robert avoids making physical contact with people and prefers keeping his distance from them. He works remotely from home, which quite pleases him because he does not have to go anywhere and spend time with other people in a confined space. Overall, Robert does not have a dependency on other people when it comes to handling his OCD and prefers being on his own the majority of the time. In Robert’s case, the combination of behavior therapy and pharmacological treatment is possible. Cognitive-behavioral treatment can be implemented for treating Robert’s OCD, including exposure and response prevention and cognitive restructuring (Moody, 2017). It is expected that Robert will feel relief from his symptoms within several weeks.",
    "Physical examination of the affected regions of the skin is necessary. Individuals with cellulitis are likely to have a reddened region of the skin, swelling as well as intense pain (Brown & Watson, 2022). Brant experiences pain in his right leg, in a reddened region that is swollen. The affected area should be thoroughly checked for any signs of skin disintegration. Variations in temperature in the area should be monitored along with signs of an abscess (Sutherland & Parent, 2017). Brant revealed that he was bit by a mosquito on the reddened area. This being a seemingly severe case, the physician may order complete blood count (CBC) testing. This will help measure blood count levels (Bennett et al., 2020). A CBC will allow the physician to make an accurate early diagnosis of a wide range of medical conditions. The physician may also order a C-reactive protein (CRP) test, which is a blood test for inflammation. This would be a necessity since Brant has broken skin because of a mosquito bite (Sutherland & Parent, 2017). Brant’s case is an event of major systemic disturbance since there is a manifestation of chills and acute disorientation. Priority diagnostic criteria for Brant would include assessing the occurrence of erythematous inflammation in the basal dermis and subcutaneous tissue. Redness, swelling, and pain are all signs of cellulitis (Sutherland & Parent, 2017). Erythema must be present in order to make the diagnosis. The location and nature of broken skin should also be assessed. For cellulitis to be diagnosed, the patient’s skin must be checked for micro-abrasions resulting from insect bites (Brown & Watson, 2022). Lower limbs are commonly affected. Brant’s positioning and movement should be adjusted. To reduce swelling in the areas facing downward, Brant’s feet and arms should be propped up on cushions while he lays on his back (Zariquiey-Esteva & Santa-Candela, 2017). If Brant stands for a long time, speedy blood flow to the heart may be hindered, which could cause low blood pressure. Brant may also need to be placed on his side in the recovery position, particularly whenever he feels nauseated or feels like vomiting. From the assessment, he feels nauseated and weak and has vomited on numerous occasions (Zariquiey-Esteva & Santa-Candela, 2017). This will help avoid low blood pressure. When germs break through the skin, “cytokines” and “neutrophils” are released into the bloodstream to fight them off. This causes cellulitis, which is characterized by redness, warmth, swelling, and pain (Brown & Watson, 2022, para 5). This appears to have been the case for Brant. He was bitten by a mosquito, which broke his skin, allowing bacteria (Streptococcus pyogenes) to penetrate the area. An outbreak of redness and swelling occurred when “cytokines and neutrophils” were drawn to the area of the skin to fight against the bacteria (Brown & Watson, 2022, para 5).",
    "One of the distinct characteristics of the nursing craft is the professionals’ need to constantly adapt to the dynamic environment of health care service and approaches to patient care. In order to facilitate this process, researchers have identified a series of change theories that seek to systematize the experience of implementing new practices (Udod & Wagner, 2018). The two most widespread theories of change in the nursing practice are Lewin’s change theory and Roger’s five-step theory. In Lewin’s framework, the change process undergoes three major stages: unfreezing, change proper, and refreezing (Udod & Wagner, 2018). Thus, according to this framework, in order to introduce change, the team needs to acknowledge the existing workflow and “unfreeze” this system, actively participate in implementing change and new functional patterns, and, finally, make the change a new generally accepted standard. Unlike Lewin’s approach, Roger’s model is more oriented towards the staff’s response and acceptance of the change through the gradual shifting process. Indeed, this five-step model implies exhaustive preliminary research, gathering staff’s feedback, conducting a pilot study, and actually implementing the change proposal (Udod & Wagner, 2018). Hence, it may be concluded that while Lewin’s model addresses mostly the implementation of the evidence-proven modifications, the five-step model is designed to prove the suggested change beneficial to the clinical environment. When speaking of the change proposal for the capstone project, Roger’s approach to change implementation is more appropriate. Considering the fact that the project seeks to justify the hypothesis of the EBP training’s positive impact on nurses’ self-esteem and patient satisfaction, the data collected from the intervention will be crucial for further implementation of this change to nursing practice. This theory has also been proven advantageous by the preceptor, as she has successfully integrated changes into the staff’s scheduling patterns using Roger’s model.",
    "It is necessary to fully understand the fundamental difference between the concepts of a leader and a regular employee in any field. While the head of the company is most often focused on the internal financial processes, a good leader understands the paramount importance of employees in any enterprise. The ideal leader sees the potential in every person and helps them develop to the maximum while working with them in the same direction instead of putting pressure. The policy of actions of flawed leaders can lead to more than unpleasant consequences for all sides of any business. Unfortunately, imperfect leaders in our time can be found a lot in any field. Bad experiences can happen on any level, from personal to global. It is particularly difficult to single out a specific person without personal experience and hard evidence, but statistics show an extremely high proportion of unscrupulous people in high positions. According to available data, the owner of Ali Express online retailer, Jack Ma, can be cited as an example. Plenty of evidence suggests that most of the items available to order are made by underage children from the poorest parts of the world. With the tacit consent of Jack Ma, many thousands of people are being exploited for minimal pay and terrible living conditions. It is an example of a person who is not only a bad leader but intentionally contributes to the violation of human rights. One of the biggest problems, in this case, is the lack of empathy and humanism. A bad leader always looks at people through the prism of a solid resource and cheap labor. It is difficult for an imperfect leader to hear and understand a person’s intentions through the prism of ignorance and selfishness. It is the absolute wrong approach, leading to nothing but a dead end. However, it should be noted that any statement in this vein is a serious accusation and requires additional thorough collection and analysis of data. The exploitation of people in any level of relationship, from business to politics, cannot lead to a successful and fulfilled conclusion. The best people and professionals will not tolerate such an attitude and quickly find a replacement with better conditions. The main mistake of many leaders in any business is an overly egocentric picture of the world and a tendency to immoral exploitation of people’s resources.",
    "Developing a contract so that all parties involved could be aware of their obligations and meet them accordingly is one of the vital tasks for an organization. Charles Schwab, an organization offering banking and brokerage services, has developed a contract for its users to sign so that both parties could meet the respective requirements (Reder et al., 2021). For their collaboration. Since the contract in question contains the essential components of a legal agreement, it can be considered viable. Starting with the key definitions of the foundational concepts on which the agreement is based, Schwab’s contract establishes the offer, acceptance, and legality terms from the start exceptionally clearly. The specified clarity and transparency benefit the company and its customers, promoting immediate trust and cooperation (Templin, 2017). Remarkably, Schwab also provides a robust basis for the consideration element of the agreement. Namely, the contract outlines the legal issues associated with the disbursement process, as well as the associated trading concerns (“Schwab account agreement,” 2022). Outlining that Schwab is not responsible for tracking the trading process, the contract sets the key responsibilities and relations between the parties completely clearly. Incorporating the primary components of a legal contract, the brokerage agreement created by Schwab offers its customers a chance to familiarize themselves closely with the services that they will obtain and the responsibilities that they have. Similarly, the contract outlines the crucial responsibilities of Schwab, thus, creating a basis for cooperation and the successful delivery of the end product to the customer. Overall, Schwab’s approach to contract development can be considered a prime example of how a contract should be structured due to the close focus on key issues and the clear delineation of all parties’ roles and rights.",
    "Differences between primary and secondary sources Primary sources are the ones providing first-hand evidence on the events or phenomena that one is studying. Such sources include diaries, photographs, video and audio recordings, interview transcripts, works of art, statistical data, and others. All of these types of sources give the researcher a possibility to learn about the investigated matter directly by observing it or reading/listening about it from first-hand witnesses. In case of the Chernobyl Nuclear Plant Disaster, the most relevant primary sources include reports, documents, and local newspapers of that time, photographs, and interviews of witnesses. By using such resources, one can obtain the possibility to learn unbiased facts and obtain the most relevant information about the event or phenomenon under investigation. Moreover, when analyzing primary sources, the researcher can become immersed in the atmosphere in which the object of investigation existed and the circumstances under which it developed. For instance, for historians and archeologists, such primary sources as ancient fossils or some tribes’ belongings serve both as sources of information and inspiration. On the other hand, for someone analyzing a political or environmental issue, reports and pertinent news releases will be helpful sources of reliable data. Meanwhile, secondary sources offer second-hand information and analyses from other researchers. Secondary sources include books, reviews, and scholarly articles investigating the subject of research. By analyzing secondary sources, one can get a deeper understanding of both the analyzed phenomenon and the primary sources. While primary sources offer a first-hand view of the situation, secondary ones enable the researcher to synthesize the material on the topic. Explain why it is important to consult a variety of sources when conducting historical research Both types of sources are crucial in research since they complement each other. Whereas primary sources offer credible evidence, secondary sources provide additional information and valuable synthesis. However, even when one possesses a primary and a secondary source, it is not enough for completing a thorough research endeavor. One needs much more than a few sources, however credible they might be. It is of utmost importance to consult a variety of sources when conducting historical research since in each new source, valuable additional evidence can be found. Also, when the same data occurs in several sources, its credibility increases. At the same time, the presence of different pieces of information gives the researcher food for thought and allows posing new questions and seeking new answers. That is why the more sources one has at one’s disposal, the better. It is crucial to consult not only a wide range of sources but also different types of them since authors of articles and books, for instance, have divergent approaches to synthesizing data.",
    "The development of the Chesapeake colonies is a bright example of how slavery became one of the integral parts of societies existing on these lands. The necessity to grow specific crops and use them to earn money and survive resulted in the constantly growing demand for the workforce. However, the practice of using indentured servants was ineffective because of the end date of their contracts. It meant that new sources of people to work on fields and plantations were needed. The resolution of the given problem was a matter of survival, as the inability to raise crops would mean death for the whole community (Kidd, 2019). Under these conditions, the development of slavery was inevitable as people stripped of their rights could be used to perform diverse tasks, and the term of exploitation was not limited. It created the basis for the evolution of slavery which became one of the fundamental institutions functioning on these lands. At the same time, the example of the Middle colonies proves that the enslavement of people and their use as a cheap workforce was inevitable. Although the pacific principles of Quakerism dominated these lands at the first stages of their evolution, settlers still needed people to perform complex tasks and support the evolution of colonies. Regarding the limited number of arriving settlers, slavery became the possible option to compensate for the deficit and create the basis for future expansion. The given trend was similar to the Middle and Chesapeake colonies, proving specific attitudes to slavery peculiar to people of that period (Huntley, 2019). They were ready to promote further evolution of this institution as the central way to support the development of the agricultural sector critical for survival and enrichment.",
    "In his writing, Daniel Spanjer claims that the Christian worldview has influenced the study of Liberal Arts. He discusses science and how humans are the products of the world – they are endowed with feeling and thought, which are beyond natural (Spanjer 3). The author differentiates the reasons for learning everything surrounding people and claims that thinkers can answer many questions, either logical or surreal. These people have developed a term worldview “to describe this holistic concept of learning, scholarship, experience and knowledge” (Spanjer 15). Even though sometimes they cannot agree on the solution to the problems, time helps them dissipate false beliefs. The other reading by Brad Green suggests the interconnection of words and faith. In the chapter. When transcendent realities and goals surround a language, it is magnificent, but when transcendence is taken away from it, it falls apart and loses its glory (Green). The word was sent by God to save humanity; He portrayed people through the words (Green). Hence, humans should follow God’s guidelines in the Bible because His sayings are truthful. In case the words are devoid of meaning, the speech is useless. The last reading by Dockery narrates about the Christian faith’s influence on learning. People are encouraged to think in Christian categories in order to sanctify thoughts and beliefs (Dockery 4). It is vital to seek God’s guidance and His calls that help humans contribute to the societal good (Dockery 8). Thoughtful believers are needed to revive faith-centered higher educational institutions because only such people will be able to promote gracious deeds. Hence, Christian worldview is again viewed as foundation of successful education and learning.",
    "Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation (NDT) is a scientific and clinical European journal. It is a collection of articles that analyze dialysis, transplantation, and nephrology research. Moreover, the NDT journal is officially approved by the European Renal Association (ERA). Thus, it presents crucial analysis and data for scientists worldwide. Additionally, the other article from StatPearls was selected as the source is included in the National Center for Biotechnological Information (NCBI). Therefore, the center distributes and stores information about scientifically approved research. The article focuses on the leading causes of chronic inflammation at the time of end-stage renal failure. In addition, the authors describe the impact of disease on clinical outcomes and the role of middle molecules as significant factors in the onset of pathology. The latest breakthroughs and research in dialysis are reviewed to stabilize the situation. The end stage of kidney damage is the stage of the development of chronic renal failure. In this case, the disease enters the final stage and threatens human life and health. Only a decrease in urine excreted (diuresis) is observed at the initial step. At stage 2, other signs appear, and nausea and a large amount of urine appear. At stage 3, the fluid does not leave, and diuresis stops. The kidneys fail, and acute renal failure develops, which leads to a deterioration in well-being. Treatment of end-stage kidney damage in adults involves taking medications. Chronic renal failure occurs in 200-500 out of one million people. Currently, the population with chronic renal failure is increasing annually by 10-12%. Morbidities with the end-stage renal disease lead to a person’s diuresis being reduced to almost zero. With advanced forms of chronic renal failure, pulmonary edema develops. At the moment, the prevalence rate of the disease includes about 759 people per million population. The incidence rate is not available for all countries globally, so it isn’t easy to analyze the information in detail. However, the average number of newly reported cases is 144 per million. The mortality rate is decreasing and currently stands at approximately 28%. Doctors prescribe a blood test to assess creatinine, potassium, and urea to determine the disease. Moreover, such a procedure as an ultrasound of the kidneys is performed. If necessary, the doctor prescribes catheterization of the renal pelvis and angiography of the kidneys.",
    "Elephants dance the polonaise, sea lions juggle balls, bears ride bicycles, a tiger jumps through a burning hoop – all these are attractions with four-legged performers that thrill the audience, especially the little ones. Nevertheless, animal rights activists have sounded the alarm because circus tricks are unnatural for wild creatures; they are considered mockery and torture. There should be a thoroughgoing prohibition on the exploitation of animals in circuses, as this issue is contrary to humane treatment and is a direct violation of their rights. Since the 1970s, numerous nations have been setting up laws to treat creatures and guarantee their essential protection. International agreements were concluded, recognizing that animals are sentient beings whose basic needs must be respected and protected (Marino 148). Significantly, the tricks taught to animals for the public’s entertainment have nothing familiar with their natural behavior. The only way to make them obey is to punish and deprive them of food so that the poor starving creature will do anything for a coveted bite (Arnold-Foster 146). Animals must maintain and express behavior specific to their species, and the concept of circuses contradicts this shepherd. Furthermore, the phrase “animal performers” often evokes positive emotions because acting is always associated with romance. However, unlike their human counterparts, animals never voluntarily choose the profession of actor. Circus experience means losing freedom forever, spending 95% of the time alone, in a cramped cage where animals cannot stand up to the full height and turn around (Ward 131). They suffer extensively, but there is nothing they can change because humans are more thoughtful and cunningly use force. It can be concluded that introducing restrictions on the exploitation of animals in the circus is a necessary measure in the current world. Creatures must be permitted to follow their instincts and be in their natural habitat because that is their fundamental freedom. All people must comprehend that the rights of animals must be protected and, therefore, one must refuse to visit performances that have been created through violence and cruelty.",
    "Commitment to health theory is a special model designed to determine the stages of development and behavior changes. This theory assumes the development of an internal state, as well as the acceptance of the desire to lead a healthy lifestyle under the conditions that any circumstances may limit a person. Moreover, with the help of this theory, the necessary level is determined, which indicates a particular stage of human health (Kelly, 2014). In addition, this theory assumes that there are no established differences, such as gender, race, and others, in order to build behavior aimed at developing a healthy lifestyle. In her research, Kelly (2008) uses the principles of the Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change. First of all, this is done in order to demonstrate certain stages of the change process. Furthermore, the model used sets specific requirements for health. Thus, the Commitment to Health Theory uses such principles as stages of change, decisive balance, and self-efficiency (Prochaska & Velicer, 1997). In this way, Kelly uses essential principles of this theory; thus, they are interrelated. Concerning advanced nursing practice, this theory can be used as a measurement of some patient indicators. Thus, this model will help determine the goals necessary for the patient to instill the desire to lead a healthy lifestyle. In practice, this theory will also help track the process of change and how to behave with the patient (Kelly, 2008). For example, at the first stage, the task is to instill confidence, as well as to indicate the importance of the necessary changes. At the second stage, strategies are already being applied to strengthen the patient’s desire to improve the overall state of health. The third stage is the final one, and it should introduce the behavioral patterns necessary for maintaining a healthy lifestyle. As a result, health care professionals can use stages of change categories and commitment ratings to personalize therapy by employing change-specific tactics and motivating therapeutic communication techniques.",
    "Being a knowledgeable and experienced professional in one’s professional sphere is, without a doubt, of great importance. For this reason, many students of medical education facilities seek to acquire as much theoretical and practical expertise as possible before graduation. Although such a strategy is by no means wrong, I have recently discovered that the true success in the work of healthcare providers is explained by the doctor’s ability to build relationships with one’s patients. I fully understood the advantage of this simple but often overlooked truth when observing Dr. Wang’s work. Dr. Wang is an experienced professional working in the sphere of eye surgery. Yet, it was surprising for me to discover how easily he/she is able to build close relationships with the patients. After analyzing her/his behavior, I realized that there are certain skills that allow Dr. Wang to gain the trust of the people that come to the Eye Surgery Institute. First of all, he/she is an active listener meaning that all of Dr. Wang’s patients are encouraged to fully and openly express their symptoms and feelings without being interrupted. Secondly, Dr. Wang is always polite and patient with people regardless of her/his overall mood. Finally, I noticed that Dr. Wang is friendly with regular patients as she/he is interested in their health and everyday lives. For instance, I heard Dr. Wang asking a woman regarding her daughter’s health because the patient mentioned that the latter was sick during the last session. As a result of such an attitude towards people, I saw that many treated people could share their problems openly with Dr. Wang as they trusted her/him. In turn, I saw that this allowed the professional to deliver better and more accurate treatment. Moreover, seeing the positive outcome that the ability to build a trustful relationship with the patients has on the healthcare provision, I have become determined to develop this quality. In this regard, I hope that my description of Dr. Wang’s practice will also inspire other current and future medical workers to develop their communication skills.",
    "One of the social factors that might impact what groceries are purchased is the lack of healthy food. Addressing Wal-Mart in Forest Part allows me to gather enough information about available products and their prices. For example, one gallon of great value milk is $2.65, one loaf of Sara Lee bread is $2.44, one bag of gala apples is $3.58, and one bag of organic baby carrots is $3.88. Continuing my visit, the prices are as follows: one yogurt container is $1.92, 2-liter of Pepsi Soda is $1.98, one bag of chips is $2.84, and one family-size pack of cookies is $3.98. In Maywood, IL 60153, the population is mostly African Americans (68.6%), but white citizens (18.2%) and Hispanic/Latino (26.9%) also live there (United States Census Bureau, n.d.). The chosen living area lacks good grocery stores, but the number of fast-food restaurants has significantly increased during the last few years. It means that people are not able to buy healthy food but have to eat poor-quality products, contributing to their health problems like hypertension and diabetes. Another social factor that affects human health and shopping habits is poor transformation and the impossibility for the working class to visit Wal-Mart regularly. The median household income in the chosen region is about $50,176, and the poverty level is about 15% (United States Census Bureau, n.d.). It means that not all individuals can go to the stores with good food and make decisions, not at the expense of their health. The combination of transportation, low income, and food factors are critical for public health (Islam, 2019). It is not enough to identify a problem but find ways to solve it and help the population achieve improvements. A community health nurse (CHN) is responsible for promoting public health and the choice of interventions to address food security. According to Schffer and Strohschein (2019), there are 17 interventions introduced in five groups with different colors, and collaboration is a unique opportunity for all community members to promote and protect health. The main characteristics of this intervention are a high commitment level, partnership, and goal orientation (Schffer & Strohschein, 2019). Collaboration at systems levels helps CHNs reach all appropriate stakeholders, community collaboration is necessary to analyze the current state of affairs, and cooperation with families improves personal knowledge and engagement.",
    "In the history of mankind, the computer has become one of the most important inventions. Hardly anyone can imagine a modern home or office without computers. While some people argue that the computer has provided us with additional conveniences, according to others, the computer has made our life more complex and stressful. I believe that computers, in the first place, have enriched our society with several advantages due to faster communication and easier access to information. The computer provides us with a fast way to communicate. In our time, when modern society is becoming more global, computers play an essential role in communication systems. Previously, communication was limited to means such as mail (Grudin, 2017). If a businessman traveled abroad, the sending of reports and reports, as a rule, was accompanied by significant delays. Since the competitiveness of a business depends on time, this situation was completely unacceptable. The Internet has allowed businesses to send messages instantly. Staff can send emails or instant messages to a manager anywhere in the world (Grudin, 2017). This has added efficiency to businesses and expanded business opportunities. For me, a computer is a technological necessity that makes my life more enjoyable and interesting. First of all, a computer is an excellent leisure tool. Watching movies and various sci-fi programs through my electronic companion is very convenient and comfortable. Also, my daily work, which brings me the lion’s share of my cash income, is not in the least tied to the computer, so it is not just a means of interactivity and entertainment but also a tool for making money. Physicians and other healthcare workers use computers for many essential uses. Computer hardware is widely used in making a diagnosis, conducting examinations and preventive examinations are examples of computer devices and methods of treatment and diagnosis (Farinella & Marco, 2018). Computed tomography and nuclear medical diagnostics provide accurate layered images of internal organ structures (Farinella & Marco, 2018). Ultrasound diagnostics and probing, using the effects of the interaction of incident and reflected ultrasonic waves, opens countless possibilities for obtaining images of internal organs and studying their condition. The diagnostics and treatment methods will be much easier with the help of computer intervention.",
    "In relation to building construction, Code of Practice may be defined as a particular set of standards, procedures, and regulations to which a contractor and developer should adhere to manage potential environmental consequences caused by construction works. For large clients, local authorities, and public bodies, it is applied to new developments and sets out requirements related to the impact of construction. It aims to provide guidance within the framework of legal, administrative, and technical systems for the protection of workers, the environment, and the public and control over major hazard installations. According to the code, by arranging separation between large centers of population, including housing, shops, schools, and hospitals, and major hazard installations and developing appropriate emergency planning, major accidents that may occur at these installations will be prevented. Code of Practice is applied to major hazard installations identified on the basis of a list of hazardous substances associated with threshold quantities. They require priority attention due to the potential for causing highly serious incidents that may negatively impact the environment and people. Thus, major hazard installations include oil refineries, petrochemical and chemical works, storage of flammable liquids, gas, and liquefied petroleum gas, fertilizer works, chemical warehouses, and water treatment works connected with chlorine. Nuclear hazards, hazards of a military nature, and the transportation of potentially hazardous chemicals are excluded from the code due to the differences in their control and management. In general, the code includes a list of activities for competent authorities that should be performed in order to establish major hazard control systems for the prevention of incidents. Competent authorities include government inspectorates and safety authorities, police, local authorities, workers and their representatives, works managements, fire and health authorities, suppliers of major hazard technologies, and other involved organizations.",
    "In the present day, the preservation of Confederate statues provokes multiple discussions. According to the official political agenda supported by former President Donald Trump, these monuments are the historical symbols of the United States that should be protected. However, more and more evidence supports the public opinion that Confederate statues should be removed as they aim to demonstrate racial disparities and the supremacy of Whites. The main argument of this claim is supported by the fact that the majority of monuments were erected not directly after the Civil War but in the 1900-the 1920s (Best, 2020). During this period, several discriminatory laws against Black people’s social rights were enacted. The construction of Confederate monuments was sponsored by the United Daughters of the Confederacy. In the present day, it was regarded as a part of the union’s long-lasting strategy that aimed to strengthen White supremacy and social inequities based on race. The connection of statues with structured racism is obvious as the second wave of Confederate monuments’ erection was in the 1920-1940s, along with “Black Americans’ fighting for civil rights and pushing back against widespread lynchings in the South” (Best, 2020, para. 4). Thus, Confederate monuments placed across Southern states, especially on courthouse grounds, aimed to demonstrate the protection of Whites by the law. The undeniable racial context of monuments’ construction has finally led to their removal or relocation during the last several years in response to discrimination against Black citizens. From a personal perspective, it is impossible to deny that Confederate statues were directly connected with efforts to strengthen White supremacy. That is why a considerable number of them may be removed – however, not all. In general, human history includes both positive and negative events. Although a considerable number of people prefer to destroy all attributes of tragic times, they should be remembered as well. In other words, mistakes of the past should be remembered for their avoidance in the future.",
    "Conflict management at the workplace is one of the crucial elements related to the organization of work in healthcare facilities. In this regard, McKibben (2017) asserts that conflict is an inevitable part of any human interaction, especially when the collective activity is associated with physical, mental, and ethical complexity found in hospitals. Consequently, if ignored or not handled adequately, the disputes between the colleges at the workplace lead to decreased performance and satisfaction levels of the involved employees (Suifan, Alhyari, & Sweis, 2020). This, in turn, negatively impacts the overall quality of provided patient care. Therefore, it is important to resolve the conflicts as soon as they appear. However, to understand how to manage disputes effectively, one should understand the factors that cause them. In general, all the antecedents of organizational conflicts may be divided into three groups, namely individual, interpersonal, and organizational. As for the former, Kim et al. (2017) argue that the healthcare professional’s self-esteem, self-focus, emotional intelligence, prevalent responses to conflict, communication styles, and overall worldview determine the frequency and severity of the disputes. In a similar vein, Chang, Chen, and Chen (2017) found that a person’s license level, age, and previous experience of working in other collectives can all affect the behavior during conflict situations. Interpersonal conflicts, on the contrary, are caused by such factors as lack of trust and respect towards a person, power abuse, and ineffective communication (Kim et al., 2017). Finally, organizational conflicts stem from the overall structure and work arrangement. In this respect, such factors as ambiguously defined responsibilities and inadequate hierarchy can cause dissatisfaction and disputes (Kim et al., 2017; McKibben, 2017). Therefore, this type of conflict appears as a result of weak or wrongful management decisions. I have also participated in several conflicts that can be explained by the factors mentioned above. Firstly, I have a friend who is generally a good person but who is quite self-focused; thus, he often fails to recognize other people’s opinions. Due to that, we usually have to do what he wants, which eventually leads to conflict when I become tired of compromising. Secondly, I have noticed that many conflicts between me and my parents and friends are caused by my inability to control one’s emotions. Finally, once, we had a conflict with my classmates while working on the team project as we failed to discuss the responsibilities of each person before starting.",
    "In many philosophies, some archetypes can be described as the perfect self in terms of the way of living one’s life. In Confucianism, such a man called junzi — a noble person or gentleman — is a common aspiration (Yu-kit 223). The combination of the highest qualities that an ideal human being should possess is an almost unachievable goal, yet the one that is held in high regard by many. This essay will describe the Confucian gentleman and compare this idealistic archetype with Plato’s philosopher-king. This idea that stems from the traditional Chinese culture continues to hold its importance for society. Such a man stands above evil ideas, recognizes them, and counteracts their effects to the best of their abilities (Yu-kit 225). Moreover, the Confucian gentleman helps others to do so through the transfer of knowledge (Yu-kit 223). Yu-kit writes that a noble person, according to Confucius, must take “a dual role of an exemplar and educator” (224). Virtues are the second nature of this man, and he exhibits them daily. The Confucian gentleman is the one who lives by the highest moral standards and aims to help others achieve the realization of this goal. Plato’s philosopher-king possesses several similarities to this archetypical role. They both are set to exhibit certain positive moral qualities while addressing negative ones through reason and rationale. He is ultimately humble and stoic and continuously seeks wisdom for the sake of the betterment of society (Mark). Notably, Plato’s archetype is more leaning toward education rather than living life as a role model for others. In conclusion, both roles possess certain qualities that define a noble person following moral qualities, such as kindness, fairness, selflessness, and the striving for harmony. However, Plato’s version of an ideal person is a stoic leader who puts wisdom at the highest value, while the Confucian gentleman is set to uphold moral values first. They are both set to uplift the personal values of other people through kindness and selflessness.",
    "Corporate entrepreneurship is the process by which groups inside an existing corporation build, foster, promote, and administer a new business distinct from the parent organization. However, these new entities emphasize the parent’s holdings, competitive positioning, knowledge, or other capabilities. The new groups may also be an oxymoron while again utilizing the unconventional approach to further economic growth alongside the meticulous planning, framework, and organization that several large firms have developed over time (Demirkan et al., 2019). Instead of reclining on their glories, the world’s wealthiest organizations, such as Amazon as well as Samsung, are progressively undertaking proactive innovation projects to prevent disruption. Amazon Custom is an excellent extension of an existing innovative initiative that has reaped the benefits of both evolutionary and radical tactics. As the name indicates, this ambitious new approach allows suppliers to provide customized items on Amazon for the first time (for example, custom text, customization, and so on) (Demirkan et al., 2019). Samsung’s innovative business strategy entails delegating new projects to an expert ‘creative elite,’ guaranteeing that they are prepared to include best practices and produce maximum KPIs (Demirkan et al., 2019). To achieve these objectives, the industry’s inventive elite use open innovation as well as corporate technical reconnaissance strategies. New product advocates explore ideas for new merchandise by independent strategic orientation, a bottom-up method. The iPod is an excellent example. It was built with the help of the company’s workers’ staffing and engineering knowledge. This approach adheres to the company’s existing strategies. Inspired strategic behavior is a top-down procedure in which policy is processed via the company’s pre-existing hierarchical structure (Demirkan et al., 2019). This process is consistent with the firm’s existing approaches, with the iPhone serving as an example. As a result, the most likely commercial development is induced business strategy. The focus of creative behavior strategy is on human effort rather than the technological aspect. It includes new ideas, products, and procedures into a person’s position. He subsequently becomes an expert in the field and works for the firm to generate fresh ideas.",
    "It is clear to modern people, as well as many people who lived in the 1930s, that the Second World War was inevitable. Some believe that the United States of America could prevent the outbreak of the war. However, this could hardly be possible due to several reasons. The American government maintained an isolationist foreign policy in the 1930s. The period was challenging as all countries had to address severe economic issues (Corbett et al., 2021). Americans wanted to concentrate on domestic matters, including a threatening spread of communist ideas (Russett, 2019). It is noteworthy that the USA could hardly interfere and have a considerable impact on European affairs due to the country’s comparatively low economic might. The United States was not a financial leader at that period, so its influence was limited. Moreover, the USA alone could not prevent the world war because it was outbroken as a result of the clash between European countries. The outcomes of the Treaty of Versailles laid the ground for the new war, as almost all stakeholders were dissatisfied. Germany accumulated resources and developed alliances with other dictatorships, so any country could not play a decisive role in this conflict. No nation could prevent the start of the new war as the regimes that emerged in Europe (the communist USSR, Nazi Germany, and fascist Italy) were likely to start a new military conflict that would inevitably grow into a world war. Therefore, it is possible to assume that the USA could not have prevented the start of the Second World War even if the American government had abandoned its isolationist foreign policy. At that, the country made a tremendous contribution to stopping the war and establishing a new world order.",
    "This paper will provide an analysis of the article “COVID-19: Impact on Nurses and Nursing” by Fauteux (2021). The abstract is supposed to be the opening of the article. It is a way to quickly introduce the reader to the results of the research. In this article, the abstract is a brief overview of the topic that will be discussed. However, it contains no information about the methods of the research or its results. On this basis, such an abstract cannot be called comprehensive. The article’s introduction is already more extensive, offering a general overview of the topic. It provides information that the times of coronavirus pandemic have affected nursing. In addition, the introduction has statistics, which introduce the reader to the subject in a tangible way. From the introduction, I learned about the general factors of COVID’s effect on nursing, including increased mortality, changes in work practices, and increased workload. This introduction can be considered extensive and adequate. The research method of this article is qualitative in that a review of a body of research draws empirical conclusions. These conclusions relate to the significant changes that have occurred in nursing and its nature. The study uses quantitative data that has already been processed and presents an overview of information previously analyzed. The result of the study is the identification of the main factors of change in nursing. These include the intensification of collaboration and innovation, the removal of practice barriers, the popularization of telemedicine, and the increased risks of burnout (Fauteux, 2021). I learned how much nursing has been affected by the pandemic. I was mostly interested in the increased risk of nurse burnout due to too much workload. I also learned about the popularization of telemedicine due to the pandemic, which was a revelation to me because the attitude of the patients to their health seems to have drastically changed after the virus outbreak. This article is beneficial in understanding how an entire division of medical practice can change under extreme conditions.",
    "Historically, law enforcement was founded on the need to ensure citizens’ safety, possession, and health and to safeguard the people from civil disorder and crime. As such, Harris (2020) shows that law enforcement’s lawful powers included using force legitimized by the government or arrests through a monopoly on violence. In its primitive system, law enforcement clan members banded together to enforce rules of the group on rogue members. The purpose behind enforcing societal directives, conducting human control, and empowering authoritative enforcement of those rules was to safeguard the people from rogue members. The community believed that any form of violence against any of them was tantamount to an attack on the rest (Harris, 2020). Therefore, to achieve its purpose, early law enforcement employed three fundamental features, no coercion, law enforcement had a wide array of tasks. The third feature was a critical distinction between the people legally endowed with policing responsibilities and those who carried out policing duties. Peace offices have the mandate of ensuring that whether on or off duty, they shall not commit any crime knowingly under the country’s laws. In the U.S., for example, peace officers are bound by local and state jurisdiction not to commit a crime. The other responsibilities of the peace officer are to not knowingly disobey the rule of law on criminal procedures, especially in such areas as detention, arrests, evidence preservation, and the use of informants (Schroeder & Lombardo, 2018). Further, no peace officer shall exceed their authority when enforcing the law, and no individual freedom shall be restricted by peace officers (Schroeder & Lombardo, 2018). Only except the law is police officers allowed to disobey the rule of law relative to the criminal procedures.",
    "The phenomenon of slavery is one of the most devastating factors that affected the lives of people of African descent throughout the years. However, it is essential to address the origins of racism and slavery in order to create a comprehensive understanding of these concepts. In the chapter “The Origin of Negro Slavery”, Williams explains that although currently slavery is deeply connected to the exploitation of African Americans, initially, populations of various races and ethnicities were occupied as enslaved people (Williams 7). Considering that individuals of all races were involved in slavery in the New World, racism emerged as a consequence of forced labor and was not originally connected to the targeted discrimination of African Americans. In the history of slavery, the first population compelled to undergo the severe process of enslavement was the Indians. For instance, Spanish explorers utilized Indian labor in their colonies to convert the population to Christianity, enforcing the necessity of slave labor on the individuals who refused to accept the Christian faith (Williams 8). Similarly, Great Britain and France supported slavery in the colonial territories; however, this event was not connected to racial predispositions but to the fact that slavery served as a preventative penalty for the indigenous communities. Nevertheless, over the course of history, enslaved Negroes became a highly more important asset in the slave trade due to the economic benefits, leading to the establishment of Negro slavery as a normal condition (Williams 21). As a result, racism and racial discrimination emerged, but the initial origin for substituting other enslaved people with African Americans remained economic, not racial. To conclude, the connection between slavery and racism lies in the fact that racial predispositions towards African Americans were caused by the overwhelming use of enslaved African Americans. As such, slavery did not emerge as a result of racism; on the contrary, individuals from various races and ethnic communities were involved in the slave trade. Nevertheless, after the economic benefits of using enslaved African Americans were established, negative racial stereotypes began to emerge, leading to the occurrence of racism.",
    "Culture is the entirety of social norms, behaviors, and customs which distinguish a certain society from the rest of the world. Naturally, some cultures have common features, thus forming cultural clusters. At the same time, leadership is a personality trait that transcends national boundaries. This does not imply that all people with power behave in the same manner, as leaders are also influenced by cultural norms. Behavior differences are evident in the way people in different clusters view time. Middle Eastern cultures are frequently juxtaposed to Western ones, particularly American. Beehner writes that while “most Middle Eastern nations are past oriented” and uphold traditions, “many Americans believe they can control the future and embrace change for the sole purpose of changing” (72). Barak Obama is an example of a leader who gained prominence by articulating the importance of change. The list of differences in leadership behaviors is not limited to the perception of the future. Crede et al. have conducted a study in which they ascertain cultural differences in relation to transformational leadership. (23). The most peculiar finding is that “transformational leadership exhibits stronger relationships with subordinate performance in cultures with low levels of gender egalitarianism values” (Crede et al. 23). This implies that the more traditional a culture is, the more successful leaders are likely to be in transformational endeavors. Altogether, there is a definite influence of culture on the conduct of leaders. Therefore, the definition of culture should include the importance of its effect on leadership behaviors. Not only does culture distinguish a certain social group, but it also underscores the likelihood of changes driven by people who have authority. After all, these people are the ones who make the most important decisions in society.",
    "The concept of culture is a fundamental phenomenon influencing all spheres of human life. It influences people’s actions, methods, and approaches toward specific tasks and daily interactions. Thus, Roseberry determines culture as a socially constructed and socially constitutive part of the context where all activities take place. It means that all other fundamental institutions and phenomena, such as power, economy, and history, comprise the culture. At the same time, being the way of life, it influences the mentioned spheres and preconditions for the emergence of critical processes in these domains. In other words, peculiarities of culture influence decision-making in political processes and historical events which took place at different stages of society’s evolution. Furthermore, the approaches to business in particular, and economy in general, depend on the values and visions peculiar to a bearer of a particular culture. For this reason, by understanding history and politics, it is possible to understand this unique notion and its layers. Rosebery also assumes that culture is socially constituted, meaning that many cultures share the same visions and values. For example, my own culture is similar to the culture of my friends and the people surrounding me as we live within the same context and share similar approaches. However, at the global level, my system of beliefs and visions differs from the same framework used by people from other regions to guide their decision-making and actions. It is explained by the social nature of culture and its unique character. It includes different perspectives and attitudes shared by people from similar communities and, at the same time, it influences their mentalities and visions. For this reason, it is possible to conclude that culture is a social construct influencing social interactions and fundamental institutions vital for everyday interactions.",
    "The process of forming states is not characterized by ease. It involves many different processes, including cultural strategies of strength. It is believed that this aspect in the form of actions of social agents is of particular importance. This is because they occupy a central place in such processes as the formation of alliances and the establishment of dominance relations. Understanding this concept can give a better understanding of the creation of Western Europe, China, the Islamic World, and India. First, it is necessary to understand what a social strategy of power is and what significance it has. Thus, it is defined as a particular area of practice where the creators of mass media have cultural influences and act as agents of social change. Thus, these sources form and influence public opinion, which may affect the formation of states. Gledhill emphasizes that the main reason for the difference between state and stateless societies is the centralization and non-centralization of power. Thus, the absence of the second aspect is expressed in inequality, and the absence of citizenship is associated with decentralization and vice versa with equality. Therefore, in conclusion, to understand the emergence of the state in the case of Western Europe, China, the Islamic World, and India, it is necessary to consider the culture strategy of power. Therefore, the author makes an attempt to distance from the generally accepted European principles and views on the role of social anthropology and factors in Chapter 3. In addition to many other political and economic factors, social influence is of significant importance. Social agents form public opinion and contribute to the formation of opinions. In this way, there is a relationship in the creation of the states of Europe, China, the Islamic World, and India and the social strategies of the authorities.",
    "Modification of personal computers required the development of more complex hardware and software. For example, buses, which are the communication channels between different internal components and peripheral devices, have become more advanced. Such three types of buses as address, control, and data are known (Farret et al., 2017). The latter is utilized for data exchange between the Central Processing Unit (CPU) and peripherals (Farret et al., 2017). The significance of the address bus is to assist the CPU in locating specific information in the memory, while the control bus regulates data processing. Data buses are represented as a multiple of two and currently include five types: 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 (Farret et al., 2017). These numbers indicate the bits of data that can be delivered simultaneously, and the larger ones allow for a more significant amount of information to be processed at a time. The number of parallel lines in a processor defines how many electrical signals can be exchanged between peripherals and the CPU. The most common operating systems on modern computers are 32 and 64-bit microprocessors. A 32-bit data bus contains thirty-two parallel lines between different structures. In contrast, a 64-bit data bus consists of sixty-four lines, allowing it to run twice as many data exchange processes (Farret et al., 2017). Hence, the fundamental difference between these two types of data buses is the speed at which they can process information. Similarly, the pace at which older versions run data depends on the number of paralleled copper wires between the CPU and other internal parts. Indeed, all these buses have one common function of interchanging data, but they vary in the rate at which operations are transferred due to their structural differences.",
    "Data science is the discipline that studies the life cycle of digital data from appearance to use in other fields of knowledge. It involves researching and analyzing substantial amounts of information and is focused primarily on obtaining practical results. The definition suggested by Os Keyes presumes that this science is the reduction of humanity to something that can be counted. This perspective is engaging in a way that Keyes’s perspective opposes the standard definition of data science. Perhaps, her expression implies that everything in this world could be measured since the discipline is concerned with countable objects and quantitative analysis. There is also an assumption that data science systems want to devour everything possible, including a human’s life, and quantify it. Finally, when it comes to the decision-making process, the systems eliminate the human factor, excluding individuals, thus making it inhumane. Numerous standardized tests are based on an algorithm that does not allow people to express their opinions. Typically, they are multiple-choice credits where one should choose the right answer. One mistake and one is at a point of no return. It means that systems only accept correct data, not allowing a human to err. As a result, humanity is accustomed to giving the right answers when necessary and at the same time being afraid to say something that will not be automatically approved. On the other hand, data science is vital in areas where mistakes should be avoided. For example, in healthcare, workers use different electronic systems that assist them in choosing the proper treatment and its dosage. Medication errors occur due to human factors mainly, for instance, when professionals forget to check the expiration date of a drug. Meanwhile, the system will suggest which pharmaceutical is better for the patient and ensure it is not expired.",
    "It was genuinely surprising to read Gerai’s account about the Dayak community, as it seems to represent an almost utopian view on sex and gender. Unlike Western perspectives that seek to distinguish the two genders, and raise one up at the expense of the other in some ways, the Dayak recognize the differences but see it as a benefit. Reading the account, it almost seemed as the culture promotes the empowerement of both genders based on the characteristics which define them (i.e., male strength, female persistence). These positives are then brought together to contribute to the wellbeing of society as well as personal relationships in a nearly egalitarian perspectives. It is difficult to believe, although greatly comforting to know that there are cultures as this. Unfortunately, most industrialized societies have the culture of severe gender clashes, and the characteristics of the gender are associated with negative aspects, such as Gerai notes, male strength is connected to aggression. I think it is correct to note that it is a matter of values, the values that are taught by society are the ones that people would exhibit. Western society gives value to hypermasculinity and aggression as definitions of males, exemplified via the genitalia and abusive actions such as sexual domination, assault or rape – therefore, the culture forms around this, being far removed from the egalitarianism and harmony of the Dayak. As shocking as that perspective may be, I agree that it reflects accurately the social element that has been created conservatively around rape for centuries. As mentioned earlier, rape is often attributed to natural biology, while in reality it reflects more the concepts of society. I think this perspective touches on both, it emphasizes the natural characteristics of the genders (strength for men, femininity for women) while highlighting its social features (men are praised, women are viewed as used and broken). It can be argued that it is built within our society, as there are certain connotations and stereotypes associated with sexual violence. For example, in a UK study, the label victim was associated with passive femininity. The feminization hypothesis holds true when it comes to rape, as victims, that are most commonly women (but can be men) are attributed feminine characteristics and greater judgment (men would not be seen as men anymore). Meanwhile the accused of committing the rape is given trait dimension of prescriptive masculinity.",
    "With thrombosis of the lower extremities’ veins, blood clots or blood clots form cavities, which interfere with the normal movement of blood. Over time, they can clog the venous lumen and even come off, ending in the heart, lungs, and other organs (Dalen, 2016). Unfortunately, it is often impossible to timely determine the initial symptoms of thrombosis of the leg vessels. However, if the skin changes color and swelling occurs where the blood clot is located, these are signs of vascular disease. When thrombosis progresses, its symptoms appear: acute pain and heaviness in the patient’s legs. These symptoms are provoked by the venous congestion below the site of thrombosis. The main causes of the disease’s development are blood clotting and damage to the vein wall (Thachil & Bagot, 2018). In addition, long journeys and old age exacerbate the risk of serious problems. It is also possible that the patient is taking medications that increase blood clotting, so it is necessary to ask him about this to be sure of the diagnosis. Ways to make an accurate diagnosis include duplex scanning, radiopaque phlebography, MRI, or CT. The combination of these methods will most accurately determine the severity and nature of the disease. After that, a doctor can prescribe a suitable treatment. Of the drugs, it can be injections of heparin and capsules of anticoagulants. If these methods do not help, then thrombolysis is necessary, which promotes resorption of blood clots. With the most severe outcome, surgery will be required. Undoubtedly, this is the last thing to do since it is always important to use all the other methods before making it. It may also be dangerous in the age of the considered patient. Thus, it is vital to use other methods and try to avoid any harmful consequences. Not only this will help cure thrombosis, but also save patient’s life.",
    "A Western scholarship has distorted the long history of African culture for centuries, and many of its basic principles have been viewed through the lens of colonization. As a result, the ideas and tenets of African philosophy have been appropriated and changed in value from the inherent parts of people’s nature into commodities. In their works, p’Bitek and Marimba discuss such concepts as culture, spirituality, and philosophy of African nations and how Western ideology has reshaped their presentation without fully understanding their meaning. The commodification of African culture and the imposition of European views on the distinction between culture and philosophy, religion and spirituality have disrupted African people’s ability to self-identify. The ideas by scholars show that African culture does not distinguish itself from philosophy or drive a line between reality and the spiritual nature of one’s being. European culture is presented as pragmatical and commodifying – it turns pieces of life that are meant to be used into objects for observation. p’Bitek writes that culture turns from “the way of life of a people” into “something that is bought and sold” (“What is Culture?” 14). As a result, younger generations of Africans, especially those living in Western countries, see their culture as a collection of souvenirs, not parts of everyday life. At the same time, they are subjected to the Western religions praising poverty and individualism (p’Bitek, “Man Born Unfree” 21). Ani notes that African-Americans suffer as they do not feel connected enough to traditional African society but feel a divide between themselves and European identity (49). Such disconnect leads to people losing their communal and generational identification. The readings discussed above show that African and European ideologies clash in many ways, and the latter assumes control over the presentation of the former. As a result, generations of people are removed from their culture, losing it or seeing through the distorted lens of commodification. African culture is inherently linked to philosophy, spirituality, living in the moment, and seeing the richness of life. However, it is turned into a tourist attraction, and its people are forced to perceive it through the eyes of foreigners, losing their inherent link to history and nature.",
    "In a narrow sense, the “zero-sum story” is a belief that there is a competition between racial groups, and any progress for one group is a threat to the resources and position of another (McGhee). This story is the mainstream paradigm for conservative media and has been told in different forms for years. The negative impacts of the “zero-sum” paradigm on the United States are massive and diverse. This mindset created additional economic, political, and social costs for all citizens of the United States. One of the prominent examples demonstrated by McGhee is the history of public swimming pools in cities across the US. At the beginning of the 20th century, there were massive public swimming pools in many US cities, yet at that time “public” mostly meant “white only” pools. After numerous drowning incidents, local municipalities were told to open the pools for all people regardless of their race, which provoked a backlash from the white residents. As a result, cities preferred to close or privatize the public facilities instead of allowing people of different races to use them freely. This is an example of the destruction of public goods and a massive cost increase for the whole population due to the “zero-sum” mindset. Another negative example demonstrated by McGhee is political in nature – many white people stopped pushing for social governmental policies regarding jobs and social benefits after the Black community joined the agenda. In the end, this means less social justice and social benefits for the whole country because the adherents of the “zero-sum” paradigm do not want other races to benefit from these policies. The arguments provided by McGhee seem reasonable and fair to me – they describe the past and current state of affairs in the United States well. The main reason I think so is the factual and statistical support of her position – it is very hard to argue that the US has significant social and economic problems due to racism.",
    "Diabetes of type 1 usually develops due to autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells in genetically predisposed individuals. The damage to beta cells occurs at a subclinical level for months or years in the form of insulitis. Patients with insulin deficiency cannot process glucose in peripheral muscle and fat tissues. This stimulates the secretion of antagonistic hormones such as glucagon, adrenaline, cortisol, and growth hormone (Lee et al., 2019). These antagonistic hormones, particularly glucagon, promote gluconeogenesis, glycogenolysis, and ketogenesis in the liver. Consequently, patients experience hyperglycemia and an anionic metabolic acidosis gap. Type 2 diabetes is the most frequently encountered pathology of the endocrine system organs. The core mechanism of disease development is insulin resistance (Lee et al., 2019). It is a decrease in the biological response of cells to one or more effects of insulin at its average concentration in the blood. Insulin resistance produces the inability of insulin-dependent tissues to absorb blood plasma glucose and disrupts glycogen synthesis in the hepatic. Persons with diabetes should eat according to a structured regimen and receive their medications with meals. For type 1 diabetes, a recommended diet includes carbohydrates from fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and skim milk. Patients with type 2 diabetes, complex carbohydrates such as brown rice, whole wheat, fruits, vegetables, and beans should be included in the rations (Sinclair et al., 2019). At the same time, for both types of disease should be avoided, consumption of simple carbohydrates such as sugar, pasta, white bread, flour, cookies, pastries. During the first type of diabetes, insulin Degludec (Tresiba) is required together with the diet. It is suitable to confound hypoglycemia in patients over 18 years of age. In addition, Zynquista is an oral medication intended to be combined with insulin (Sinclair et al., 2019). Besides, individuals with type 2 diabetes may require insulin if their diet plan, weight loss, exercise, and anti-diabetic medications are not achieving their target blood glucose levels. In that case, Insulin Degludec may also be appropriate; the oral drug is Metformin.",
    "The healthcare industry typically draws sufficient attention to patients’ education, especially when it comes to representatives of minority groups. That is why the article by McCurley et al. (2017) offers valuable information. The researchers demonstrate that Hispanic individuals deal with improved diabetes prevention when they participate in individual and group face-to-face sessions (McCurley et al., 2017). I believe that there is an apparent reason why such positive outcomes are achieved. It seems that face-to-face interventions are effective because patients have an opportunity to ask questions if they require explanations. Simultaneously, such educational sessions demonstrate that a patient is not unique with such a health issue. As a result, such interventions can improve people’s morale, which, in turn, will lead to increased motivation to take preventive measures and protect health. This information allows for supposing that face-to-face interventions can be suitable to my practicum project that considers measures to improve access to care among African Americans with heart failure diseases. However, the focus on patients’ cultural backgrounds should not lead to ignoring a broader context. This statement refers to the findings by Cajiita et al. (2017), who stipulate that the use of mobile technology in healthcare (mHealth) can promote better knowledge. These scholars focused on 129 older adults, and almost 25% were African Americans, to analyze whether mHealth leads to improved care (Cajiita et al., 2017). The use of mobile technologies can be as effective as face-to-face interventions because modern people spend more time online. That is why it is reasonable to rely on mHealth opportunities to improve access to care among African Americans. Finally, it is possible to suggest that combining mobile technologies and face-to-face educational sessions can result in the best outcomes.",
    "In order to prevent heart disease, cancer, and diabetes, people are required to adhere to strict routines, including in terms of diet. According to American Heart Association, people wishing to prevent heart disease must consume food which does not contain added sugars and high volumes of sodium, as well as saturated and trans fats (“Staple Ingredients”). Additionally, individuals need to eat whole grains, vegetables including frozen and canned ones, nuts, seeds, and meat such as chicken and lean beef. American Cancer Society’s dietary recommendations to people include the need to consume more fruits and vegetables, especially dark green and orange ones, since they have a considerable cancer prevention capacity (“American Cancer Society”). Moreover, the society advises people to eat foods high in fiber, such as legumes and whole grains, while avoiding red meats and added sugar. Finally, American Diabetes Association recommends eating more non-starchy vegetables, including broccoli, carrots, cauliflower which need to constitute one-half of each meal (“Eat Good”). The association also highlights the significance of consuming foods high in protein, such as beans, hummus, and lentils, as well as fruits and monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats. The recommendations to prevent the three previously mentioned conditions are, to a large extent, similar. Essentially, all organizations state that it is important to avoid consuming added sugar and saturated and trans fat. Additionally, people wanting to prevent heart disease, cancer, and diabetes also need to eat more fruits, vegetables, and chicken meat. At the same time, red meat is strictly prohibited for cancer patients while generally available for people with diabetes and heart disease. Individuals with diabetes should consume more non-starchy vegetables than people with the other two conditions. Finally, to prevent heart disease, people must particularly be careful about consuming any type of fats.",
    "One is watching the news or reading the latest article from Forbes, and you see the terms “business” and “economics” used interchangeably; one may wonder about the differences. Business and economics are similar in that they are supplements to each other, both dealing with the process of creating products and services and selling them to generate output. These are fields of study that are closely related and include a range of shared subtopics, such as enterprises, marketing, finance, manufacturing, and banking. Both are social sciences that focus on financial measurement and analysis, focusing on variables that impact the market and also focus on short- and long-term projections, as well as the inner workings of various industries. Finally, both business and economics tend to focus on various problems facing the nation, its citizens, government, and private enterprises (Vaidya). However, there are some differences between economics and business, which are based on their conceptual purpose. Economics is a study focusing on understanding human behavior and, in turn, how that reflects on the broader economic elements of whole nations. Meanwhile, business is aimed at studying the process of the exchange of goods and money specifically, and all the related elements starting from production to the final sale, and how a specific enterprise fulfills this process. It can be argued that business is a subset of economics, as the human behavior in that exchange of goods is a point of focus (Casson). A major difference is in concepts, economics deals with theories and broad elements of the economy, such as supply and demand, interest rate, and international trade. While these undoubtedly impact business, both individual entities and as a field of study, business focuses on the process of wealth creation within the context of the economy and typically applies practical theories. Economics focuses on and attempts to maximize the welfare of society, while business is centered on its shareholders. Both face different issues, with economics encompassing poverty, unemployment, taxation, and federal expenditure, while business focuses on product positioning and differentiation, marketing, growth or lack thereof of profitability, and individual or industry performance (Gitman et al.). While business and economics share many commonalities, their conceptual and practical differences make them distinct sciences.",
    "The difference between a doctor approaching a patient in comparison with nursing practice on the same subject can be an excellent topic due to the highlighted features that are emphasized when parallel. Thus, medical practice using one’s physiological status while nursing also implementing psychological responses is an effective way in making the difference between the two clear while operating based on PICOT. The points to be included are the difference in the research approach. Since medical practice is more objective due to the fact that it relies on specific outcomes and facts, the research is quantitative. On the other hand, the PICOT question included in the nursing practice implies mixed research that considers both opinions and data. Topic presents the differentiation between nursing and medical practice in terms of approach to diagnosis. The vital factor that is being brought up is the PICOT in relation to lab results versus assessment based on symptoms. The research can highlight the outcomes in terms of the accuracy of the findings while focusing on the comparison between the two concepts. The aspect that illustrates its importance is the overall parallel between the two models that may have similar results depending on how the research will be conducted and its findings. The potential research focusing on the nursing practice of preventing certain injuries and providing more patient-centered and personalized care can emphasize the importance of decision-making in the field. Decision-making is an essential concept in the nursing care field (Nibbelink & Brewer, 2018). Hence, a PICOT question on the topic of providing specialized care in terms of preventing falls versus solely treating them can be an effective way of discussing nursing from a personalized perspective.",
    "A digital engagement policy determines how the organization intends to position itself online. The regulation also covers the company’s brand qualities and its vision and mission objectives. It also directs how employees can communicate digitally, both internally and externally, with suppliers and clients (Brown, 2019). In addition, the above guidelines also target social media interaction practices that may affect the business, either negatively or positively. Our organization has a digital engagement policy that it utilizes to protect the reputation of its brand. Moreover, the above strategy has enabled the business to increase employees’ commitment while boosting the levels of their obligation. Hence, workers share more about the organization online, thus, contributing to more sales and profit. Additionally, with the above rules in place, the firm’s private information is secure since it is not shared online. My professional presence online is aligned with the organization because it entails displaying the company’s products and services and connecting with all stakeholders. My existence online builds a good relationship with clients, friends, and followers, which is advantageous to the business since the company image has improved. This has helped the organization become relevant because it has offered its clients a ‘human face.’ I use media platforms to promote my brand by focusing on different social networks. I also create informative and engaging content about the company’s products and ensure all the information is up-to-date and accurate before uploading. It is critical to do regular online marketing while avoiding over-posting not to look desperate. All the updates of accomplishments and newsworthy developments are done 3 to 4 times a week. The topics that I frequently post on social media to market my brand are about the pricing of the products. I also emphasize the benefits of using our merchandise and services while comparing with others in the market. I always comment more on the developments and accomplishments achieved but avoid posting any negative comments made by an individual or a dissatisfied customer because this could cause a destructive online discussion, which may diminish the brand. After completing the course, I plan to change how to respond to any negativity, and I will not ignore any undesirable feedback because it enlightens me about the buyer’s experience. In addition, I will also start to market strategically, for instance, to develop a procedure of targeting my audience depending on the social media network, have schedules for my content, and change the communication methods.",
    "The case under consideration, Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S., was significant for developing measures to avoid discrimination in the workplace. More specifically, it was primarily related to diversity in terms of sex and age since this combination frequently evokes the concerns of the population (King, 2021). The examination of the issue by relying on the example of Gerald Bostock was advantageous for establishing proper employment practices in this respect. In this lawsuit filed by the plaintiff, the main factor was his unjustified dismissal from the company in which he had otherwise positive reputation. This event was caused by the man’s interest in a gay softball league which he expressed while being in the workplace while neglecting the provisions of Title VII (Mallory et al., 2020). This part of the Civil Rights Act, confirming the violation, was relied on by Bostock when initiating legal action, but it was initially dismissed by the district court due to its allegedly erroneous interpretation (“Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S.,” 2019). The appeal, including the claim to include sexual discrimination in consideration, was successful as Bostock managed to support his position with the opposing statements of Massachusetts law, Chapter 151B (“Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S.,” 2019). In this way, the meaning of the previously used provisions regulating such cases was modified accordingly. To summarize, the examined court case based on employment law and, more specifically, discrimination against workers happened to be crucial for making adjustments. The previous evidence, as per Title VII of the Civil Rights Act did not include the particular considerations of sex and age. Hence, this gap was compensated for by this decision, and the consequent change in the legal provisions helped guarantee the equality of people in the workplace in the context of their diversity.",
    "There are several types of fake news, ranging from apparent articles to more subtle kinds of deception. People frequently rely on critical decisions on what they read in the news, such as how to vote in elections or what therapy to provide when they are sick. This is why it is critical to have trustworthy news. When individuals can’t identify the difference between true and fake news, critical social and political issues get muddled and misunderstood. A lot of false news is created with the intent of inflaming and exacerbating societal disputes. Most significantly, critical thinking is required while posting or researching on a certain issue, writing comments, and engaging in other social media activities. Many fake news articles are constructed in such a way as to elicit strong emotional responses such as fear or wrath. As a result, critical thinking and research are essential. It’s crucial to examine a few choices when spotting disinformation, recognizing fake news sites, and double-checking before sharing or posting a comment. First and foremost, double-check the source of the news or information. Fake news sites frequently employ addresses that sound like legitimate newspaper locations, but they lack authentic stories on various themes. If the website appears to be unsteady, go to the “About” page and seek a detailed description of the company. Second, look into the author. Check them out to see whether they’re reliable – do they have a strong reputation, and do they write about their field of expertise? Furthermore, the motivation of the author may be essential in the dissemination of forgeries. Third, fact-checking is necessary since trustworthy news reports will include numerous facts such as data, figures, and expert statements. If they aren’t there, inquire as to why. Reports containing misleading information sometimes contain wrong dates or time periods, so it’s a good idea to double-check the article’s publication date.",
    "Geographical distribution and location Banana is a popular fruit crop that grows all over the world and has several health advantages. Bananas are particularly significant in several low-income, food-insecure, least developed nations, where they may help with both household food security and revenue-generating as a cash crop. The crop is a key export item for a number of agricultural nations, and it is Africa’s, Asia’s, and Latin America’s biggest fruit crop in terms of production and commerce (MacKinnon & Cumbers, 2019). Bananas from Central and South America, as well as the Philippines, account for more than 90% of all exports (MacKinnon & Cumbers, 2019). The EU, the USA, China, Russia, and Japan are the top importers (MacKinnon & Cumbers, 2019). Banana output worldwide is projected to be 130 million tons per year (MacKinnon & Cumbers, 2019). Approximately 87 percent of bananas produced in the globe are consumed by farmers or sold in local marketplaces. Almost a third of it is farmed in Sub-Saharan Africa, where it meets more than 25% of the dietary energy requirements of over 100 million people (MacKinnon & Cumbers, 2019). East Africa produces and consumes the majority of bananas in Africa. Spatial Distribution Large supply growth in top exporting nations Ecuador and the Philippines, as well as strong rises in import demand, particularly from China and the European Union, are key drivers of trade (MacKinnon & Cumbers, 2019). Large retail chains from key importing nations are now operating directly in the global banana value chain. These networks buy bananas directly from growers and distributors rather than via typical fruit corporations (MacKinnon & Cumbers, 2019). The intricate web of interactions involved in the production, distribution, and trade of any given commodity may lead to genuine conflicts of interest among groups of individuals over who benefits the most from a product. Cheap bananas are frequently passed on to small farmers and plantation employees down the supply chain, resulting in lower salaries and working conditions (MacKinnon & Cumbers, 2019). Currently, the main issue in terms of spatial distribution is that large-scale banana production may negatively affect the environment, worker health and safety, and local populations. This occurs due to the frequently harsh techniques employed to regulate irrigation and plant diseases. Sources MacKinnon, D., & Cumbers, A. (2019). An introduction to economic geography .

    "Making Budgetary Control Effective A robust organizational structure is required for budgetary effectiveness. Permanent specific concerns, such as a finance committee and a budget director, should be established. To avoid bottlenecks, budget planning must be well integrated. Budgets for individuals should be harmonized with each other. Budgets must be reviewed on a regular basis to avoid them from devolving into a license to spend the entire authorized amount even when it is not necessary. According to Dauda (2019), “business organizations of all types must engage in financial planning at whatever level to ensure judicious deployment of resources for achieving organisational goals.” Workers should be appropriately compensated for performance in accordance with the budget. Sloppy staff, on the other hand, should not go condemned. Behavioral Aspects of Budgetary Control Budgetary control is a crucial instrument for performance evaluation. Nevertheless, findings take time to appear. Those in charge of fiscal control should have extensive knowledge and expertise in the subject. Workers are modifying their working practices, routines, and even their inter-relationships based on finances. As a result, workers may exhibit reluctance to change. It leads to the creation of each budget with the backing of top leadership. Each employee’s requirements are fully described and distributed in a formal structure. If this is the case, they will be aware of their power and responsibilities, which will be valuable for budgetary management. A financial management program’s effectiveness depends on the organization’s defined objectives. As a result, when establishing targets, management should exercise caution. Furthermore, the aims are explicit.",
    "Gendered behavior denotes fundamental expressions of gender socialization and identity through an individual’s various developmental phases. Thus, gendered behaviors refer to the ways persons behave according to their respective male or female genders (Au & Rudolfsdottir, 2021). One of the prominent gendered behaviors instilled in me during childhood was that women are the primary cooks in the home. Hence, from childhood, I learned how to prepare food for the family, unlike most male relatives around. Even the movies mostly depicted women as the cooks in the home. Perhaps the gendered role that I quickly adopted/ accepted from childhood was the idea that women are natural caregivers. The function depicted women as noble people who consider the plight of others in the home and society and consistently seek to alleviate suffering. Women are warm, nurturing, and caring. Thus, many regarded professions that require empathy like nursing and teaching to the women’s domain. The idea that women are more humane and caring appealed to me and caused me to accept the role. In my mind, the part admitted what many would prefer to ignore/ deny: women play critical roles in retaining sanity in the world. For me, the role meant that women could play vital functions in stemming the tide of oppression, suffering, and cruelty evident even from childhood. Therefore, the idea that women are more caring and naturally nurturing appealed to me because it placed the gender on a nobler pedestal. Despite the perceived nobility of the gendered role that women are more nurturing and caring, specific adverse consequences emerged regarding employment opportunities, as previously highlighted. In many ways, many subsequently considered women to be unfit for specific job descriptions like piloting, engineering, and doctors, which were better paying (Samidha, 2019). On the other hand, societies restricted women to courses like nursing and teaching. Most patients assume women caregivers to be nurses rather than doctors in the care centers. Hence, the role may cause conflicts when deciding on career opportunities.",
    "A lot of historical events and time periods have specific names. The renaissance, the enlightenment, the stone age – all of these were called such for a particular reason, and signify a way to differentiate one era from another. One prime example of that trend is the industrial revolution. Also called the industrialization, it was an important part of history and a big step in both technological and social development. Happening at a never-before seen speed, the process has begun and ended in less than a 100 years. The word “revolution” in “industrial revolution” is used to emphasize that fact, and note that the process is regarded as both an extreme and quick advancement in society ( Industrial revolution ). Like a real revolution, it also had a variety of effects on people and their lives. By changing the way work is performed and understood, it fundamentally shifted the people’s understanding of the economy, labor, and the world itself, driving both positive and negative change. For entrepreneurs and people starting their own businesses, the industrialization became a central source of focus and income, replacing the manual labor of people. It also created opportunities for new types of production and large scale manufacturing to be performed. The introduction of complex machinery profoundly affected the workers as well, driving the unskilled labor out of fashion and requiring a higher degree of both education and proficiency. Industrial revolution has made many lose their jobs, while a number of other people have gained new possibilities of employment via migrating into cities (Thompson). Industrialization drove urban development, and contributed to the establishment of the city as a central hub for human interaction. On a larger scale, the ability to mass produce goods and services has allowed countries to establish larger economies, expand trade, and start more thorough relationships with their neighbors. Overall, the industrialization age has had its ups and downs, but the significance of the process is hard to overlook, as it remains the basis for the society people see today.",
    "Miranda warning, also known as Miranda rights, is a formal statement in which a person being arrested is informed of their basic civil rights under the jurisdiction of the United States. Through this warning, an officer of the law enforcement notifies the individual of their right to remain silent, as well as to an attorney. Such principles reflect the foundation of the legal system of the United States, in which both sides are protected by a comprehensive set of rights in order to eliminate bias and enable an objective investigation of the case. The obligatory nature of the warning serves the interests of both sides of the process. First of all, the person being detained possesses an inherent set of rights, which must be respected within the framework of the court of law. They are guaranteed by the United States Constitution, and depriving a person of them would be a major violation of this fundamental law. Rogers and Drogin (2019) state that it would be a misconception to believe that every resident is fully informed of their rights by default. Furthermore, a failure to provide a notification of rights may render the defendant’s testimony inadmissible in court, as it can be dismissed due to possible coercion. This way, Miranda warnings align with the interests of both defendants and prosecutors. On the other hand, it appears possible to argue for the redundancy of rights in some special cases. For example, the arrest of a dangerous criminal or a person responsible for major terrorist threats is often deemed as not requiring a Miranda warning. In such cases, the situation may develop in a matter of seconds, making it necessary to incapacitate the perpetrator before starting legal procedures. From this perspective, it may be contextually appropriate to postpone Miranda warnings until the public safety is secured. In other words, the possibility of a direct, immediate threat to people’s lives outweighs legal formalities (Rogers & Drogin, 2019). Nevertheless, Miranda warnings should not be ignored completely, as they form the core of a transparent trial. Therefore, even if they are not presented at the moment of an arrest, Miranda rights will be given later once the situation is secured and prior to launching formal legal procedures.",
    "The doctor’s job is to follow ethical standards, including loyalty to patients and respect for their choice. However, the profession concentrates on philosophical, religious, and cultural traditions and beliefs. Physician-assisted suicide can be seen as voluntary death by a medical professional. At the same time, the doctor provides all the necessary means and information regarding the patient’s desires for the end of life. However, such cooperation on the part of a doctor cannot be ethically conditioned. Allowing euthanasia can cause irreparable harm to the patient if done incorrectly. Thus, a person can be left without the possibility of a habitual existence. Even though many patients who decide to die to suffer from incurable diseases voluntarily, the doctor cannot assist them. In this case, the moral commandment that a person cannot take someone else’s life is violated (Clarke et al., 2021). Moreover, doctor-assisted suicide is wholly opposed to the definition of a profession aimed at helping people. The doctor is seen as a healer, while physician-assisted suicide does not seem to control and calculate the risks, which can be a threat to many patients. The dilemma lies in the Hippocratic oath given by all doctors, one of the points of which is not to harm. Thus, helping a patient with a death wish can be seen as a deliberate wish to injure the person. Moreover, it may reduce the level of trust between patients and medical staff since taking a life cannot be ethically justified. In addition, the religious view forbids doctors to help patients at the end of life, referring to the commandment not to kill a person. Furthermore, killing may be considered offensive due to society’s moral attitude. The patient’s pain can be alleviated with the help of available medicines, while the loss of life is an irreversible action.",
    "The project aims to explore the questions behind people’s sexual orientation identification and the reasons behind it. Some people consider sexuality a subject of choice; others argue that the environment cannot dictate a person what sex attracts them. The latter group proceeds with the argument that sexuality is determined biologically, making it an aspect of one’s identity, which should be protected by the government (Sheldon et al., 2017). To further explore people’s perspectives on the matter, the project’s topic can be phrased as the following research question: does the environment affect people’s sexual orientation? While exploring the subject of the research, the following dependant and independent variables related to the topic were identified with the help of the GSS database. The dependent variable is sexort, which stands for respondent’s sexual orientation. The question related to this variable is: which of the following best describes you? This variable was chosen due to the fact that it allows determining what environment has surrounded the respondent. The independent variable related to the topic of the project is sexbirth, which stands for the sex assigned at birth. The GSS question for this variable is: What sex were you assigned at birth (for example, on your birth certificate)? The sexbirth variable was chosen since it is necessary to identify respondents’ sexuality and homosexual individuals for the research. There is an essential correlation between the two variables that can facilitate the project’s research. People’s sex identification significantly affects their lives and experiences. For example, the environments surrounding a male and a female can differ critically. As a result, such differences in the environment’s impact can affect people’s identification with sexual orientation.",
    "One of the main purposes of a leader of a business is to select the best course of action out of the available alternatives when it comes to the process of decision-making. Clearly enough, it is impossible without a thorough understanding of a company’s business environment. When it comes to entering the market with the goods for the purchasers’ consumption, the one theory that specialists often take to is the supply and demand theory. This theory is utilized to understand the customers’ buying behaviors and help managers strategize the product in the market in accordance with them. For instance, a lack of demand for the product signifies that supply needs to be shortened – and vice versa: when there is an increase of demand, it is reasonable to enhance supply of goods as well. Additionally, a supply and demand analysis helps in pricing: if the demand for the product is high, buyers are more likely to accept price increases an keep on purchasing it. With the low demand, however, prices should be sufficiently affordable; otherwise, the producer will suffer losses. There are various strategies to make the supply and demand model work to one’s advantage. Dayton cites an example of De Beers – a company specializing in creating diamond jewelry. Their vaults are filled with diamonds – but they manage to maintain high prices for gems by limiting supply. Thus, diamonds keep staying a rare commodity, for the acquisition of which as a status symbol purchasers willingly pay. Another organization using the supply and demand theory to their advantage is Zappo. Dayton states that the company’s primary idea of selling shoes online – that is, with no option of trying them on beforehand – did not seem like a good one. However, Zappo became a success story by having gained control over supply – their enormous assortment, excellent customer service, and a favorable return policy make buyers choose them time and time again. Finally, there is Apple – a renowned giant of the technology market. Their building of anticipation for the release of a service or a product is a manufacturing demand that makes purchasers feel like they are a part of something bigger than simply another gadget’s market entry. In conclusion, a supply and demand theory can definitely be used as a tool for navigating the market – one only has to search for appropriate ways to use it to their product’s advantage.",
    "The influence of social networks is increasing, pushing traditional media to second place. In particular, Twitter platform has become an influential tool for obtaining current information and even conducting debates on various topics. However, tweets can also be different and may or not impact society. This paper examines the Australian politician Bill Shorten’s tweet concerning the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS). Although the politician reports a joyful event in his message, he also expressed regrets about the current policy, limiting the NDIS activity. This tweet is meant to be both informative and grievance. At the same time, the author reports that the girl received assistance thanks to NDIS funding but also regrets that this was possible only after public coverage of the situation. As a result, Shorten deplores the current policy of the Australian government because of which NDIS has limited capacity to help people. While his tweet simultaneously has both negative and positive messages, it can have a positive impact. Criticism from an influential politician can draw attention to the problem and call on society and government to solve it. Several signs indicate the impact of the investigated tweet is. According to Casero-Ripollés (2020), activity, popularity, and authority are the main signs of influence. This post received 209 retweets, 50 comments, and 858 likes – such activity for a poorly discussed topic is quite a significant influence. However, the popularity of the issue is low, and in relation to the population of Australia, such indicators are small. Assessing authority, one can say that Shorten as a politician, is aware and concerned about the topic and has experience and knowledge to express an authoritative opinion. Thus, the tweet may be influential in discussing the activities of NDIS but not on the national scale.",
    "There is a growing number of physicians’ encounters with the victims of human trafficking, sometimes even without recognizing them as such. Recently, Todres (2017) reported an incident, where Dr. W was requested to screen the women-employees of such a firm for sexually transmitted infections. On the one hand, according to the Code of Medical Ethics of the American Medical Association (2011), it is necessary to safeguard patient confidentiality, including several aspects, such as physical, informational, decisional, and associational privacy. At the same time, it is obligatory to keep the records of all the patients in the healthcare settings while Dr. W was asked not to maintain them to avoid possible arrest of these women. Thus, the doctor understood that in another case, the employees of this firm would not have a chance for diligent healthcare and, moreover, could possibly spread the STIs further. The case engages issues in several fields, such as criminal law, ethical concerns, human rights, and service provider regulations. From the side of conspiracy law, it is possible to assume that the agreement of Dr. W is equal to the participation in the crime. As she is aware of the crime and did not report it but helped in its realization, the court’s decision can be not in her favor. From the point of view of human rights, prostitution is illegal in the US. Even more, if the minors are employed in the firm, the case falls under the mandatory reported law (Todres, 2016). Ethical considerations here also imply helping a child by breaching confidentiality. To conclude, the decision in the case of an encounter with human trafficking should be equivocal. By facilitating the activity of an enterprise engaged with human trafficking, a physician is partly responsible for the crimes and exploitation of women and children. Therefore, following the legal frameworks and ethical considerations, such cases should be reported.",
    "Feminist ethics is founded on the views that women’s subordination is morally inappropriate and that women’s moral experiences are as valuable as men’s. Vaughn (2019) states that the following are the practical aims of feminist ethics. Firstly, feminist ethics express moral critiques of behaviors and attitudes that reinforce women’s rights. Consequently, the vital goal is to provide morally reasonable means to oppose such behaviors and practices. Ultimately, feminist ethics’ objective is to imagine a morally good alternative that promotes female empowerment. Feminist ethical argument resurfaced in the late 1960s, first among the general public and then in academic discourse, as part of a broader rebirth of feminist ethical questions. On issues like abortion, fairness and equality, domestic work, sexual violence, and obligatory heterosexuality, the first academic feminist ideas were expressed. Nonetheless, the term ‘feminist ethics’ did not become widely used until the late 1970s or early 1980s (Vaughn, 2019). Traditional ethics, feminists speculated, was more thoroughly male-biased and required more radical reconsideration. Moreover, feminism is continuously engaged in ethical thought and discussion. According to Vaughn (2019), feminism is primarily a normative viewpoint, and feminists themselves regularly challenge its meaning. Lack of care for women’s interests, disregard for women’s concerns, rejection of women’s moral agency, devaluation of feminine ideals, and depreciation of women’s experience are all manifestations of feminist obstacles. Putting women’s interests first, considering women as ethical experts or authorities, exchanging male for female values, or extrapolating directly from women’s moral experience are all illustrations of how feminist ethics has been stereotyped and viewed. Essentially, these stereotypes are widespread and inaccurate; feminist ethics is significantly more extensive and more open than the misinterpretations suggest. To summarize, modern feminists are experimenting with new methods of thinking about moral themes that are attentive to their specific particularity and inherent shared worth, such as shared humanity, fairness, and impartiality.",
    "The concepts of domestic violence and abuse refer to psychologically or physically aggressive behavior of one family member towards another. This aggression could take the form of beating, rape, screaming, and humiliation. Unfortunately, in the modern world, these are common phenomena. According to statics provided by Huecker et al. (2021), 10 million Americans per year suffer from violence and abuse. The victims of domestic violence and abuse feel depressed and helpless, and their self-esteem is also extremely low. Fear of the aggressor might force a victim to keep calm about the experience of being abused. Nonetheless, there are signs via which a provider could suspect domestic violence, child abuse, or elder abuse. If a woman arrives at the emergency room with bruises or fractures that do not as she slipped on the wet floor, a nurse could suspect that her partner beats her. In addition to that, victims are highly likely to be depressed and anxious even though they might try to hide these emotions (Lloyd, 2018). A provider has a reason to be concerned with child abuse if a young patient is underweighted without objective reason and is afraid of other adults. In addition to that, a child might get severely scared with a loud sound or sudden movement. As for older adults, a nurse could suspect abuse if they have bruises, broken glasses, or walking stick, show signs of depression, and fails to take medications properly. Another warning sign is the refusal of a caregiver to leave an older person alone with a nurse. Undoubtedly, caregivers might not be willing to leave in some cases because they worry about missing information on an older adults health. However, a strict refusal to follow the requests of the medical staff and negotiate is a bad sign. In every health facility, a nurse who notices the signs of abuse and domestic violence must report them to the relevant authorities. More precisely, in the case of child abuse, medical staff contacts social services via hotlines or a written statement. The fact of elder abuse should be reported to the agencies on adult protective services. Finally, a nurse should inform the local law enforcement of the case of domestic violence. Still, before informing the related agencies, a nurse should discuss the case with a physician or a nurse practitioner and exam the patient without the potential abuser in the room.",
    "Introduction The fashion industry is one of the most dynamic sectors around the globe, and the dynamism arises from the diverse needs of the client base. Fashion is a personal statement and a symbol of societal status that also defines a person’s culture and individuality. As a result, clients are always curious about fashionable pieces that serve several factors while maintaining a particular budget. Although many clothes stores stock a variety of fashionable clothes, they do not capture the clients’ personality and individual needs because the designs are premade. Most stores such as Zara and H&M invest significant funds into identifying the unique needs of their clients. However, their reach in identifying these needs is not yet global, and this implies that a significant section of the target market buys what is available. Therefore, bridging the gap between what the clients want from their preferred clothes stores and what the stores are offering is crucial in promoting customer satisfaction. Our project, Be-Unique , intends to solve this problem by leveraging technology to bring the services closer to the clients. The purpose of the project is to provide a highly integrative platform through which customers can digitally access their favorite clothing stores. The platform intends to revolutionize the fashion industry by offering clients an opportunity to present their unique designs for customization. Online clothes from stores such as Zara and H&M are made using standard sizes that may not fit all body sizes within the standard measurements. Our online stores’ mandate is to ensure that clients have easy access to thigh-quality fashionable items that can be customized to fit their unique sizes. Therefore, our mandate will include offering the clients an opportunity to submit their sizes to our platform, whereby their clothes can be tailor-made to fit their unique sizes. Our highly skilled team will be on standby to take clients’ measurements and submit them to the famous clothes stores for customization.",
    "The editing in the first episode of the series Money Heist is in line with its thrilling plot and rapid action. In the first scene, as the character gets ready to exit her vehicle, the editing is quick, focusing on the items she is picking up. Similarly, the camera often focuses on objects, leading the viewer towards the items that will become an essential part of the narrative. For example, one can see the ringing phone before it is picked up. Moreover, the show uses rapid editing with close-ups and the use of objects that identify characters – guns, money, and other items that show one’s motives or their identifying trait. The characters’ close-ups are dynamic, often using dolly shots to slowly expose the background or move with the character. This way, the camera does not stop as long as the characters move or the whole room is exposed. When they stop, the editing is as rapid as the conversation between people. In monologues, the dolly is used again to keep the tension as the series requires a serious tone in many scenes dealing with life-or-death scenarios. Notably, the character in a close-up is rarely placed in the center of the screen. The shot is divided into thirds vertically – and the characters stay in the first or third part. Hand-held shots are also used, and they are consistent with scenes where characters feel insecure, aggressive, scared, or exposed. Moreover, when the characters are walking, the camera moves at the same speed. The change between steady dolly movements and hand-held “shaky” shots is needed to juxtapose moments focused on action and interpersonal drama. Moreover, tension is the primary source of emotion, and the editing keeps enough suspense by using close-ups of characters rather than an overview of the whole room.",
    "The Supreme Court ruled that Static Control’s claim of violation of the Lanham Act clause falsifying advertisement was valid. The underlying issue in the case was that the Supreme Court had to determine the meaning of the provision by applying the traditional principles of interpreting the statute (Campbell, 2020). The second issue is that labeling the claim by Static Control as a prudential standing question was misleading (Halbert & Ingulli, 2020). Lexmark bases the arguments on the prudential standing of Associated General Contractors. However, the case has strong grounds on statutory provisions that the Supreme Court had to ascertain in terms of statutory interpretation. The causes of the statute violations damage the plaintiff’s reputation since they fall within the zone of interest covered by the statute. The Supreme Court presumed that the statutory cause of action extended only to plaintiffs for whom the invoked law protects their interests. According to Bennett v. Spear, 520 U. S. 154, the span of the zone of interest varies depending on the law at issue (Tavares, 2021). The Lanham Act includes statements of purposes such as the people engaged and protection against unfair competition. Common law depicts unfair competition as causing injury to a business’s reputation or sales. The plaintiff must then show that they suffered a commercial interest injury within the zone of interest in a false-advertising suit. The Supreme Court also presumed that the statutory cause of action is limited to the plaintiff whose injuries arise from the proximate cause of the violation of the statute. For example, in the case of Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corporation, 503 U.S. 258-270, the statutory cause of action bars suits from damages that are remote from the defendant’s unlawful conduct (Jones, 2019). However, since the Lanham Act only allows commercial injury lawsuits, the proximate cause of the consumer deception is not fatal as required by the statute. The principles act as guidance than the direct-competitor test, reasonable interest by the Sixth Circuit, or multifactor balancing test recommended by Lexmark. The principle also outlines that the claims by Static Control fall under plaintiffs authorized to sue under §1125(a). Static Control can sufficiently allege that it lost sales and suffered injuries in its business reputation within the zone of interest caused by Lexmark’s misrepresentation.",
    "Marketing is one of the most critical aspects of every business, which makes organizations look for effective ways to attract new customers. However, not all marketing activities are fair or ethical, and targeting uninformed consumers is among them. One should explain that uninformed consumers are individuals who lack the psychological or mental maturity to make reasonable decisions and purchases. Examples of these people are children, the elderly, and individuals with psychological conditions. Consequently, it is unethical to target such consumers because this practice can provide these people with adverse outcomes. Many factors explain why it is unethical to target uninformed consumers. The first robust argument comes from the definition presented above. Since these people do not have psychological or mental maturity, target marketing can force them to purchase unneeded items. Consequently, this marketing approach is a form of manipulation of unprotected populations. The second reason refers to the fact that it is challenging for uninformed consumers to locate sellers’ lying. As a result, organizations can provide customers with false information to stimulate their buying behaviors. Irrespective of this information, some people claim that there is nothing wrong with targeting uninformed consumers. This point of view relies on the belief that such customers represent new markets, and organizations are free to enter and benefit from them. However, it is challenging to deny that these consumers are vulnerable populations, meaning that they deserve a specific attitude. That is why it is unethical to target uninformed customers. In conclusion, the essay has presented robust arguments of why organizations should refrain from targeting children, the elderly, and people with mental conditions. Even though some people and businesses stipulate that these populations are suitable for marketing, it is better to avoid them. The rationale behind this statement is that uninformed consumers do not have psychological maturity, meaning that target marketing can force them to make unreasonable decisions and purchases.",
    "The European powers had taken major parts of the world, including the Caribbean. In the 15 th century, the Europeans claimed the region following the establishment of Spanish settlements and conquest of the Aztec and Inca empires (Horne, 2018). Due to the conquest, it was easy for the Spanish to invade Mexico and Peru through exploration in strategic points of the Caribbean region. Following the Spanish invasion of the Caribbean in the 17th century, other European powers such as the British and French started settling in pivotal points such as the island of Tortuga and later moved to Jamaica (Horne, 2018). By mid-century, many non-Hispanic privateers had established permanent colonies and trading zones in Caribbean islands. The profitability in terms of wealth enabled rise of conquest to Caribbean region. First, it was easy to obtain gold, which was among the region’s key aspects of the scramble. The existence of Christopher Columbus in the region had shown the way for other leaders to set colonies (Horne, 2018). Second, there was the availability of a labor force drawn from the African continent as black people were used as slaves to work in the industrial openings in the area. Due to the decline of Spanish power in the region, majorly as a result of reduced native population of the area, the other European powers boosted their presence in areas that Columbus had covered. For example, Francis Drake, a privateer from England, attacked many Spanish settlements (Horne, 2018). The collaborative base between the French, British and Dutch made it possible for European powers to conquer the significant area of the Caribbean. After start of the competitive nature of colonies, sovereign battles emerged that led to stiff wars that made it hard for the Caribbean islands to unite against European rule (Horne, 2018). Because of the emergence of agricultural activities, the Atlantic slave trade saw many Africans work for the Europeans in the Caribbean, strengthening their colonialism in the area hence conquering the region significantly.",
    "Introduction Back to the Future is a unique film of its time, which has become a cult film thanks to its gripping plot and attention to detail. Screenwriter Robert Zemeckis created a movie about travel, pitting opposing personalities against each other who later became perfect partners. Thesis: Robert Zemeckis created an award-winning film that changed views on cause and effect and interactions through plot structure, character development, and setting. Body Paragraphs   * The plot structure of Back to the Future keeps the viewer interested in the film through logical cause-and-effect relationships.       + Each moment in the film is connected to the last moment and the next, weaving them into a unified structure.       + The scene begins with a ticking clock, then shifts to the theft of the plutonium and a focus on Marty, who is unaware of what was stolen under his bed.       + Marty ignores the safety of the clock tower, but later it turns out that he was around when the tower stopped.   * Character development in the story is built on the opposites of Marty and Doc, who elusively turn out to be people with similar histories.       + Marty is relatively quick and restless, though Doc seems judicious and prone to over-analyzing the situation: together, their work is coherent and efficient.       + Marty uses teenage slang while Doc uses proper speech: their different characters allow them to see the best in each other and develop as individuals.   * The film’s setting is new and unusual for the time of its creation, so the viewer’s eye is drawn to the screenwriter’s love of detail and desire to fill the film with characters from different eras.       + The differences in road construction quickly determine the time difference: in the ’50s, some were dirt roads.       + The film revisits the clock tower, which was in operation in the ’50s and stopped in the ’80s. Conclusion Back to the Future reveals to the viewer a new reality in which everything is interconnected: logical connections, people, and places. Zemeckis has created a unique story that amazes audiences with its details, developments, and shifting eras.",
    "The study showed that bibliometric analysis of evidence gathered from integrative reviews and analytical studies had substantial implications for nurse-related and evidence based policy changes. Primarily, this is possible through the use of integrative reviews in designing new programs (Benton et al., 2020). The collective database of the synthesized studies as suggested by the authors of the study, can be utilized by nurses to be empowered through evidence-based materials in the formulation of changes in universal health coverage. As such, the applicability of this information has a number of benefits for working nurses, as they will be able to employ concise and trusted resources when advocating or implementing changes to policy. I think that nursing practice can be vastly improved with the use of well-managed databases that employ evidence-based research. This is because such a database will be able to illustrate gaps in knowledge of overarching issues as well as daily medical practices in the sphere of nursing (Houser, 2016). Similarly, it allows for insight into nurse-specific fields such as nurse education, care for the lederly, emergency care, and more. Currently, accessibility to extensive and complete information that is formed through evidence-based research is limited due to a number of factors. In order to better provide such informative materials among working nurses it is essential to reduce bureaucratic processes and integrate technology into the process. Modern technology allows for low-cost and time-saving methods of information sharing, which will be largely beneficial for nursing. As mentioned prior, evidence-based research has the potential to reveal gaps in information in nurse-specific practices that would otherwise be unseen. I believe it is essential to make such knowledge accesibile and cohesive to promote better nursing care and work quality.",

    "It is a film about the fragility of masculinity, men’s mental health, and how they are interconnected. Fight Club is a crude portrait of what happens when men’s insecurities turn into masculinity in overdrive. Thus, this film represents toxic masculinity. Fight Club shows men dissatisfied with the state of masculinity. The characters are different in that many of them were raised by their mothers because their fathers either left the family or got divorced. According to Ta, the result is that the characters see themselves as “a generation of men raised by women” (270). In their life there is not enough male education for the formation of their masculinity. It confirms the idea of phallocentrism, which is based on the image of castrated women. Women raise children so that they can enter into the symbolic order. Fight Club is a wicked satire about finding, nurturing, and destroying yourself. It challenges ideas of masculinity, adding to the image of a real man several features that can be called associative and setting self-destruction and a destructive impact on society as one of life’s goals. The victory of Jack’s subpersonality over Tyler on the roof of a skyscraper shows that the good in a real man can overcome the destructive element. The ability to self-sacrifice and responsibility for his actions in Jack, who has gone through the evolution of masculinity, inspires some optimism, but the finale remains open.",
    "In the development of nursing in Europe in the 19th century, the activities of an outstanding personality, the Englishwoman Florence Nightingale, played an important role. Florence was looking for an opportunity to help the poor and the sick. At that distant time, activities related to mercy, helping those in need, were considered an occupation not worthy of a noblewoman. The young woman sacrificed personal life expensive relationships with her parents but remained faithful to her calling. Furthermore, her values and commitment allowed Florence to become a historical figure in modern nursing, to whose leadership people owe accolades for paving the way of nursing’s place in our societies. Thanks to perseverance and perseverance, in 1851, Florence entered the community of the sisters of pastor F. Flender in Germany, where she received a nursing education. Subsequently, Florence made a considerable contribution not only to the treatment of cholera help in wars but to the development of leadership and the reformation of nursing (Kim, 2020) The selfless woman became an example of service to people and a prototype of international mercy. Moreover, Florence managed to change a common thought about nobility of nursing, her leadership allowed to reestablish pivotal understanding of nursing practice. Her significance can easily be depicted on a medal with her image, which is awarded for special merits to distinguished nurses. A large role in the development of nursing abroad belongs to the international society of the Red Cross. The International Committee for Relief of the Wounded, headed by A. Dunant, convened a conference in Geneva in October 1863 with the participation of representatives of 13 countries, at which the charter of the International Organization of the Red Cross was developed, and the emblem of the society was adopted. The United States achieved tremendous success in the development of nursing in the 19th-20th centuries, when the American Medical Association was first established. (AMA) (Kim, 2020) In 1873, the first three nursing schools were opened in the USA according to the model of the F. Nightingale schools in London (Kim, 2020) Thus, the further formation of international humanitarian organizations was also primarily made possible by leaders such as Florence.",
    "Diana Kendall claims the current perception of the class has been a construct of the media and based on the construction, the meaning of class is determined. Kendall argues that the media has legitimized inequality in the United States through the assumption, with television programs and newspaper articles creating and reifying class-based stereotypes. Furthermore, Kendall argues that class discussions in the media are rarely explicit; however, their portrayals generate perspectives that impact human behavior. The upper class in society is portrayed positively, while the lower class is framed negatively. On the one hand, the upper class contains individuals that should be emulated, comprised of caring and generous people, and those with criminal records have remarkably good lives (Kendall 10). On the other hand, the lower class is framed as homeless, poor, largely ignored by the media, and often discussed as abstract statistics. As such, when casting a human face, the demographics of the poor determine how they are framed. The quality of life may deteriorate from the understanding that as the media focuses on the upper class’s viewpoints and gives voice to their concerns, it neglects the concerns of lower-class members. The conveyed class discourses by the media, including constructions of the homeless and the poor, portrays a lifestyle inflicted by laziness, diseases, crime, and substance abuse (Kendall 94). The dehumanized statistics associated with personalized suffering portray people detached from the broader contributing factors like unemployment, ignorance, laziness, or otherwise responsible people for their misfortunes (Kendall 94). Therefore, courtesy of the detachment, the life quality of the low-class individuals continues to deteriorate since the uneducated and the poor’s needs are overlooked. With attention given to upper-class individuals, the needs of the poor are not voiced; therefore, their lives continue to be exposed to deterioration risks.",
    "Although the Monster can be considered a bad character due to murdering people, the creature has good traits as well. The Monster is described as ugly and strong but at the same time, inexperienced. Firstly, Frankenstein’s creature is described as “its gigantic structure and the deformity of its aspect … instantly informed me that it was the wretch” (Shelley). Despite his ugly and terrifying appearance, the subject did not have the intention to kill people. The creature can be compared to a baby who tries to examine the world it lives in, and its actions are just contractions to the cruelty of the world. Frankenstein’s monster is not a real monster; it just seeks love and attention that the world cannot give him. The creature’s emotionalism is a positive feature as it allows it to understand people’s feelings and share them. The “Gothic” elements of the novel include supernatural motives, the architecture from the Middle Ages, and the spiritual aspects of human nature. Other “Gothic” elements consist of the strive for knowledge, the Monster, and the probable moral fall of men. I like that genre because I like looking at diverse issues from various perspectives. This novel allows me to look at the actions of Victor Frankenstein and the Monster and understand their motives and feelings. I also appreciate novels that aim to show moral aspects of society with the utilization of different symbols, such as the Monster. Mary Shelley’s husband believed that inappropriate social relationships are the result of people becoming evil. To make people bad, other representatives of society should reject them and make them feel useless or bad. I agree with this opinion, as people’s intentions are generally based on their experience of social interactions. If society treats people as if they were misconducts, there is no reason to try to be good or fit in. I believe that one of the integral themes of the novel is loneliness. The Monster aimed to integrate into society; however, people met him with disgust, fear, hatred, and all the spectrum of negative emotions. Hence, the creature turned to evil because of the feeling of loneliness. Nowadays, society often tries to isolate individuals who do not view the world the same as most people do. This feature often leads to the feeling of being lost and lonely.",
    "The concept of “gender roles” is often applied to the analysis and comprehension of writings from various historical periods. These responsibilities appear to have been firmly defined during the Anglo-Saxon period. The poem Beowulf belongs to the epic or heroic poetry genre, which has poems that commemorate the characters’ brave and martial actions. Women are portrayed as belongings for the advantage of the men throughout Beowulf and are made to support the male characters. In addition, women are utilized as plot devices to advance the story tale of men. Women, on the other hand, are a minor character in the plot, their presence being overshadowed by the men. The queen of the Swedes was given no name, her identity being secondary to her status as the king’s wife, Onela. The males, such as Hrothgar, Beowulf, Wiglaf, and Unferth, occupied the majority of the storyline of the poem. As a result, mentions of women are few and far between in comparison. “…the Helming woman went on her rounds…treating the family and the collected troop,” the poem says of a woman who fulfills traditional gender responsibilities as a character Beowulf (Heaney 620). The passage represents the expectation of women in the eleventh century, that they should look after males and be gentle. Queen Modthryth was presented later in the tale as the antithesis to Queen Hygd, who was autonomous and despised by men. “Even a queen of great beauty must not overstep like that,” they said dismissively. (Beowulf 1940-1941), until she married Offa, who rewarded her for her self-control. Queen Modthryth was only considered acceptable by society once she married, implying that women had less value unless they were married.",
    "Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) have become a part of all humans’ lives, but they remain a debatable issue thus far. Some people argue that it is not ethical to change any genetic information and play God (MacKinnon & Fiala, 2017). However, I believe that GMOs are only another advancement in people’s lives as the creation of machines, cars, or spaceships. GMOs (be it a plant or animal) are a part of my life as well, as I have consumed GMO-based products. I am not concerned about long-term effects as much as some of my peers since I find GMOs to be a product of selection that has been in place for centuries. People have noticed some properties they considered to be appropriate for them and tried to grow as many plants and animals that have certain qualities as possible. I would use the principles of utilitarianism to support my claim. This theory is based on the view that everything is ethical if it contributes to as much good for as many people as possible. GMOs can help people overcome one of the major problems that is famine. GMOs are resistant to harsh environmental conditions, so people may grow more crops and other important plants. Millions of people still starve and are in need of food, so the production of more food is beneficial for all. Of course, some use the deontological approach and state that it is simply wrong to interfere with genetic codes as it is the divine domain. GMOs are seen as people’s attempts to play God, which is morally wrong. However, I would stress that even according to the Bible, humans were given the planet to take care of it, so using innovative tools is another way to follow the Christian postulates and take care of all creatures.",
    "The issue of the internationalization of companies is a phenomenon that has consistently attracted the attention of researchers in the field of management. In the last decade, the focus has shifted from considering the benefits and risks of internationalization to studying the strategies of international companies operating and developing. However, it should be remembered that globalization acts as a kind of institutional environment for global companies, characterized by high uncertainty and risks and a non-monotonous, dynamic nature. The main incentive for the globalization and internationalization of the company is a significant expansion of market opportunities, both production, and trade. This is also connected with the benefits gained from implementing an international strategy, namely the growth of the company’s market, economies of scale and learning, and, of course, the advantages of new locations. Many companies from developing countries such as China, India, and Taiwan are active in global value chains in high-tech sectors of the economy (Stallkamp & Schotter, 2019). However, this fact leads to the fact that there is the broadest range of problems inherent in international companies in these countries. For example, emerging markets often have inadequate government oversight and regulation levels, leading to global companies’ unethical and criminal trading practices. For example, a typical example of this is the exploitation of cheap local labor to make production more affordable for international businesses (Mashan, 2021). This is morally and ethically appalling in the extreme but will have dire consequences for the company in the future. Given the benefits of international diversification, some firms choose not to expand internationally for several reasons. The most common of these is the reluctance to go beyond the domestic market of their homeland (Paul & Mas, 2019). This suggests either an unwillingness to face the risks of globalization or an initial calculation of opportunities, taking into account only the company’s home market factors. Moreover, an important reason for the rejection of globalization may be the awareness of problems faced with a foreign market, its characteristics, and potential consumers’ culture, religion, and customs. Thus, the global strategy has its colossal advantages and disadvantages that can push the company away from this approach.",
    "Gnomial Functions Inc. wants to determine the most reliable forecasting technique for determining the sales level for the next eighteen months. The sales trend reflected a consistent increase over the last 18 months with minimal seasonal variation. However, the sales for recent months reflected had more significance on the following months sales (Wisniewski, 2016). Consequently, Gnomial Functions Inc. should use the weighted moving average to forecast the most likely level of sales. The weighted moving average used four weights to determine the likely level of sales in the next month. These weights ranged from 0.1 to 0.4 for the earliest and most recent months respectively. The most recent data received a higher weight due to its higher relevance to the future level of sales. Consequently, the weighted moving average generates accurate forecast compared to the simple moving averages. The company can realize even more accurate forecast by adjusting the weights for the moving average. The management should give higher weight to the recent monthly sales to reduce the forecasting error. Specifically, the mean absolute deviation and mean standard error for the initial weights (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4) was 6.27 and 47.29. In contrast, when the new weights that give more importance to the recent performance (0, 0, 0.4, and 0.6) are applied, the mean absolute deviation declined to 4.81, and the mean standard error declines to 27.28. This performance is better than the simple moving average. Gnomial Functions Inc. should use the weighted moving average to determine the likely level of sales in the next year. This method is simple, effective, and reliable. In addition, it can be adjusted to reflect the changes in sales trend by adjusting the weights to give the requisite importance to the recent months. Therefore, the company should use weighted moving average to estimate the likely performance in the coming year.",
    "The modern world economy is so diverse and deep that it is very difficult to predict for sure when a crisis will break. Recession is danger, and danger is stress – in such a situation, the brain begins to rely on basic instincts of protection – to run, hide, survive. Crisis intervention is a relatively new discipline, the main task of which is to provide temporary emergency emotional assistance to victims of mental and physical violence (Colford & Cavaiola, 2017). Nowadays, there is a risk of economic decline which can seriously affect the entire population; hence, I would not like to experience recession since it would significantly affect my life. The crisis is a phenomenon that takes a toll primarily on the individuals who work for non-profit organizations. There is an increase in layoffs, which means many people will have live on the state allowance. The inability to find a job is the next cause of the crisis. What is more, the level of poverty will raise making people abandon their homes. Individuals will not be able to afford necessary items as well as paying rent. Hence, I consider a recession as an undesirable event for myself due to its damaging nature. When considering the crisis from a professional point of view, the crisis affects the national economy as a whole, affecting not individual enterprises, but the entire sector of the economy. There is an increase in the cost of credit resources and the difficulty of attracting them. In addition, there is a threat of deterioration of relations with international partner organizations. In general, the crisis is an undesirable phenomenon due to its devastating effects and unpredictable consequences.",
    "The YouTube video published by GP Synergy, “GP Training in Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services,” sends a message that Aboriginal Medical Services play a crucial role within the diverse community. The services are essential for providing culturally sensitive and high-quality care to the target populations, often marginalized and underserved, ensuring they have everything they need to tackle rising health concerns. The comprehensive set of services provided by the medical facilities ensures that the patients from the Aboriginal community have access to affordable and convenient health care. One service can support multiple aspects of clients’ lives. The comprehensive approach toward culturally-sensitive care is especially relevant in addressing the social determinants of health (SHOD), which encompass multiple areas of the population’s health, well-being, and quality of life. SDOH includes safe housing, neighborhoods, convenient transportation, racial discrimination and violence, education, income, job opportunities, access to nutritional foods, low-quality air and water, and language and literacy skills (Healthy People 2030, 2020). Therefore, the Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services aims to address the health disparities and inequities that most Aboriginal patients encounter (Pearson et al., 2020). The professionals working within the Aboriginal Community Health Services framework underline the importance of patient education to ensure that the population is aware of its potential health challenges and knows about the necessity of early prevention and management. The prominent SHOD that is being discussed in the “GP Training in Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services” video is discrimination. The health center workers acknowledge that many of their patients have experienced discrimination in the healthcare system and want to receive culturally-sensitive services (Kim, 2019). Providing such services is challenging because healthcare workers do not know what to expect from each patient and must be prepared to carry out culturally sensitive services (Jongen, McCalman, and Bainbridge, 2018). Care continuity is especially relevant in this case because when patients feel that they are being discriminated against or misunderstood, they are less likely to return to their providers to continue treatment or screening for their core health concerns. Even though implementing culturally sensitive care and addressing the SHOD of discrimination is challenging for providers, it is also highly rewarding. The patients discriminated against want to feel accepted, understood, and cared for. Because of this, the workers of the Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services institutions always prioritize building meaningful relationships with their patients (Luft, 2017). Besides, the professionals have noted that they have taken the role of advocates who support their patients in terms of healthcare services and their acceptance in their immediate community and the larger society. Therefore, the work of Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services professionals entails consistent collaboration between themselves and their patients who feel underserved and misunderstood. To conclude, addressing the social determinants of health that affects the Aboriginal community is a demanding process that requires dedication and focuses on the unique needs of patients coming to a facility to receive culturally-sensitive care. Undoubtedly, the process will take some time because healthcare providers must be well-prepared and well-versed in the social determinants of health affecting their clients.",
    "The cultural effects of Roman dominance over the Greek-speaking regions is a fascinating topic that has attracted great scientific interest, especially in the last couple of years. The impact of the interaction between two cultures varied in time and space and was definitely more prominent in places where Roman communities had emerged. These communities served as the so-called influence vectors, and their long residing alongside Greeks resulted in the transmission of Roman elements into public life. One of such elements was Roman names, the dissemination of which may be explained by the existence of networks of exchange and the sense of identity of name bearers. Rizakis (2019) notes that the introduction of the Greeks to the Roman system of naming with its further adaptation to their norms and the Roman names adoption by peregrine Greeks are two different phenomena. However, they both are examples of the interaction process between the two traditions, which gradually led to the appearance of a common onomastic culture. This acculturation form, increased in the 2 nd century AD, showed wide regional variability, and the reception of it was different in different cities and social classes. These cultural transfers were mostly mediated by civic elites, as their purpose was to pass on their influence by name – both in a regional context and more broadly, on a system level. Tria nomina, in particular, and its use in the imperial period especially, as stated by Rizakis (2019), was a source of pride, power, and prestige. Due to this, some names became popular as expressions of the shared culture and were accepted and adopted, albeit on a small scale, by the lower classes as well, having lost their original meaning. However, the dominance of Roman names as the distinguishing signs of the Empire’s free citizens took place for a short amount of time. As per Rizakis (2019), by the end of the 3 rd century AD, a new way of identity expression appeared – a single naming system using separate Greek and Roman names. At first it was used sparingly but after the reign of Constantine – and especially during the period of late antiquity – it started being employed in almost all Roman provinces. This change, advanced by Christianity’s progress and the Roman Empire’s decline, might be deemed as a return to the Greek naming tradition.",
    "Health promoters are a trained workforce whose primary purpose is to improve health through a variety of activities carried out by health promotion organizations. Individual empowerment, societal responsibility for health, and establishing an enabling environment for developing personal skills and boosting community action are among their top goals (Nutbeam, 2019). In the realm of health promotion, experts from various multidisciplinary health workers have agreed on the characteristics of effective collaboration and an interdisciplinary approach. Interdisciplinary teams’ most essential purpose is to bring together a variety of diverse viewpoints on caring and to use the talents and knowledge of many different individuals and sectors. Intersectional collaboration between different health professionals and the public and commercial sectors is critical for effective health promotion (US Department of Health and Human Services, 2018). The diversity of these elements demonstrates that one’s health is not just dependent on medical services or nurses and physicians (Nutbeam, 2019). The large range of activities that make up health promotion needs a diverse set of abilities from a number of health professionals and industries. Incorporating multidisciplinary specialists within the health promotion team, such as Nurse Practitioners (NPs), Social Workers (SWs), and Registered Nurses (RNs), will be advantageous in the long and short term. Nurse practitioners are nurses who receive further education and training and are capable of treating a wide range of ailments as well as providing preventative care and health education (Pun, 2018). Social workers have specialized training in assisting people and groups in developing skills and resolving difficulties. Whether the issues are personal, interpersonal, or social in nature, social workers can assist in guiding and resolving many of today’s issues (Nutbeam, 2019). Registered nurses examine and analyze healthcare needs in order to decide the best service or treatment, the best healthcare provider, and the best equipment to deliver patient care (Pun, 2018). Thus, their skills and approach will be essential in the success of an interdisciplinary team tasked with health promotion.",
    "Like many other areas of life, music has changed along with society. The period between 1959 and 1963 was transitional, and at least two distinct markets emerged in the music industry (Covach and Flory 112). The first one was defined by the new generation of teenagers who favored dance music (Covach and Flory 113). The second market consisted of former rock and rollers who preferred folk music associated with social, political, and economic issues (Covach and Flory 113). Folk had a long history of addressing problems within American society, and its music appeared to be more dedicated to the community than commercial pop (Covach and Flory 118-119). Folk performers appealed to the audience and represented people rather than being above them (Covach and Flory 119). Almost anyone could play folk, as the music was simple and required a few easy guitar accords (Covach and Flory 119). Thus, the idea spread of folk being “for the people and by the people” (Covach and Flory 119-120). The concept was related to the music and the people’s ideologies, as the singers and the audience, united by social issues, expressed their concerns through songs. As folk was the music of people, it was also a movement characterized by many important figures. The Weavers consisted of traditional performers such as Peete Seeger and were one of the most significant folk groups in the US (Covach and Flory 119). The Weavers focused on societal problems and prioritized the simplicity of the music, gaining an audience among college students (Covach and Flory 119). At the beginning of the 1960s, The Kingston Trio was the most popular group that started the folk revival in the mainstream pop market (Covach and Flory 119-120). The Kingston Trio’s pop-sensitive approach was favored by the public and defined folk music for many general listeners (Covach and Flory 120-121). Considerable singers have represented folk music, supporting the movement of addressing issues within society.",
    "The Roman Empire was largely polytheistic, suggesting that people acknowledged and honored several different gods. They thought that these entities had a part in the formation of Roman civilization and shaped the events of people’s everyday lives (Bartsch, 2020). Because of Rome’s geographical location, its population had regular interaction with Greek peoples who had expanded their territory into the Italian peninsula and Sicily (Beard, 2015). Many features of Greek culture were borrowed by Rome, with minor modifications to fit their requirements. According to Polybius ‘ interpretation of the Roman government, the monarchy was solidified in the office of the Consul. The tales of Manilus Hippomanes, Olivier de Noyen, and Julien Barneuve are connected through history in The Dream of Scipio by a philosophical musing claiming that man is accountable for his action’s own redemption, but only by understanding, not by works or faith (Ruden, 2013). Rome had two chancellors, each in control of divisions of the Roman army and had the authority to convene conferences and present different initiatives before the Senate; they were acclaimed yearly. Citizenship in Rome was a complicated notion that differed depending on one’s gender, family, and status in society. Males were the only ones who could acquire full citizenship. A kid born of a legal union between a citizen father and a citizen mother would be granted citizenship by descent (Beard, 2015). Citizenship in the United States can be obtained by birth or registration. People are generally born U.S. citizens if they are born in America or are born overseas to U.S. citizens. They may also obtain U.S. nationality as a youngster as a result of the marriage of one or both adults.",
    "A proposed financial plan to support Mental Health Services for Healthcare Providers of Critical Patients: Category Subcategory Expenditures ($) Staff Mental Health Service Manager 400,000 Personal Consultants 840,000 Group Consultants 650,000 Technical Support Staff 180,000 Equipment Personal Laptops 12,000 Personal Mobile Phones 5,000 Services Telephone Service 2,400 Internet Service 300 Supplies Administrative Supplies 500 Medication 1,500 Training Employee Training 2,000 Managerial Training 2,000 Maintenance Offices Maintenance 3,000 Laptops and Mobile Phones Maintenance 1,500 Other Expenditures Unforeseen Expenditures 5,000 The impact of a biblical stewardship perspective on the proposed financial plan The biblical perspective on stewardship presumes that leaders are granted control over other people and resources by God (Carradus, Zozimo, & Discua Cruz, 2020). Thus, they should strive to ensure the well-being of every person in order to honor the Lord. In this regard, the current financial plan was designed in a manner that would benefit all the stakeholders involved, including healthcare providers of critical patients and consulting staff. The potential holes and unknowns in the project’s financial plan Although the financial plan seemingly addresses most of the expenses that may occur during the project realization, there are still some unknowns that should be considered. As such, O’Connell (2020) argues that managers should always think about the worst-case scenario and be prepared to respond adequately. In the case of the current project, first of all, it is hard to predict the real demand for mental health services among doctors. This, in turn, negatively affects the ability to predict the required number of mental health workers. Secondly, potential crises and resulting inflation rates may cause a price increase, which, in turn, would necessitate additional money to purchase equipment and medication. Moreover, the costs for the services, training, and maintenance may also surge. Assumptions that can fill the potential holes in the project’s financial plan As for the former hole in the financial plan, it can be assumed that there will be an average demand for mental services among healthcare professionals. This assumption would help to partly mitigate the risks of the unknown need for offered services. It is explained by the fact that when the expected demand is low but the actual necessity is high, then the patients are largely underserved. On the contrary, when expectations are high, but the actual demand is low, it leads to substantial financial losses. As for inflation, it is necessary to assume a certain amount of money for unforeseen expenditures. Therefore, if the prices rise, the organization will still be able to pay for the planned expenses.",
    "In the article “The influence of peers during adolescence: Does homophobic name-calling by peers change gender identity?” the authors claim that negative name-calling among peers can lead to a change in gender identity. Firstly, this is because negative experiences with peers of the same sex result in the need to identify with peers of the opposite sex. Secondly, during the period of growing up, the adolescents’ identity is not yet fully established. Therefore, they are constantly re-evaluating whether the identity formation is going in the right direction. DeLay et al. (2018) recognize that homophobia can be directed at homosexual and heterosexual adolescents. This is presumably because the purpose of victimization is to hurt someone’s feelings, not point out real flaws. Gender identity development is a critical stage in developing a personality occurring during adolescence (DeLay et al., 2018). Since homophobic name-calling is a form of victimization, this practice should be frowned upon or banned in schools. Ioverno et al. (2021) note that “bullying GNCV may represent a defensive reaction to demonstrate bullies’ gender conformity” (p. 215). Therefore, work with bullies should be carried out competently and with the participation of a psychologist. Interestingly, Ioverno et al. (2021) highlight how this statement is especially true for male bullies. That is because their “own gender conformity can affect the selection of victims based on their gender conformity” (p. 216). It is critical to understand this mirror interaction to resolve the issues of gender victimization. Equally important, victimization of adolescents, including LGB, trans, and heterosexual high school students may lead to “anxiety, depression, and substance use disorders, especially among sexual and gender minority youth” (Valido et al., p. 602). This is another valuable observation that indicates the need for concomitant prevention practices of substance abuse among adolescents. No less important, substance abuse should be perceived as the consequence of psychological problems.",
    "The first mention of a homosexual act is found in the Old Testament Book of Leviticus. And it is said there about this in a prohibitive manner: “Do not lie down with a man as with a woman: this is an abomination.” (Leviticus 18:22) The Apostle Paul says the following: “Just as men, having rejected natural intercourse with women, burn with lust for one another: men do shameful deeds with men, preparing for themselves the retribution that they deserve, having gone astray.” (Rom 1:27) First of all, when talking about homosexuality – the scriptures talk about “intercourse” or “lust,” but not about orientation in the sense that homosexual people today have in mind – an equal love relationship between two partners of the same sex. Homosexual relationships have been shared at all times and in all societies. However, the idea of ​​”orientation” as a property inherent in a particular person is relatively new; it appears only towards the end of the 19th century, making it difficult to directly compare the phenomenon of homosexuality in the context of Christianity (Kuefler 1256). The second important point is comparing religious books of homosexual relationships with a relationship with women. Homosexuality existed in the ancient world and the Middle Ages – but it was never understood as an equal union. In the Christian world, the execution was supposed to be for sodomites. In England, sodomites were executed until the New Times; for a long time, homosexuals were one of the targets of the Inquisition. The Code of Justinian in Byzantium provided severe punishments for them: up to castration and the death penalty. Given the high religiosity in the authorities, such persecution was supported by religious overtones. However, there was no equal modern understanding of the union, even at the level of a philosophical idea: such events were a deviation from the norm and were not perceived fundamentally.",
    "The framers of the Constitution did not believe that citizens would take an active part in the political life of the country. While many freedoms were incorporated in the Constitution, its framers doubted whether people were interested enough in politics to follow its makings. It is true that in those times, information was limited; however, nowadays, mass media help people to be well-informed about political events. Moreover, the media act as a watchdog on the governmental powers (How Does the Media Affect Politics). Informational agencies report the events and let readers make their minds about them or share their views (How Does the Media Affect Politics). However, it always pays not to rely on the media too much and take pains to follow the political life of the country. They felt that everyday citizens were uninformed and did not care what was going on in our government. I disagree that citizens are uninformed and do not care about political life. Nowadays, there are many organizations that promote civil rights and freedoms closely following the events on the political landscape of the country. People do not wait for a crisis to voice their opinions; on the contrary, citizens try to stay well-informed about what is going on (Jach & Trolian, 2022). The media, as a great source of information, facilitates this task, allowing people to have access to the latest events all over the world (Greenberg & Page, 2015). Crises as such make people more interested in politics, but there are many people who take pains to voice their opinions, notwithstanding the political or economic situation. These people deserve great respect as they act as watchdogs on the wide judicial, legislative, and executive powers vested in our politicians and judges by the laws we have adopted as a nation.",
    "Olivier Armantier’s et al. article, “How Economic Crises Affect Inflation Beliefs: Evidence from the COVID-19 Pandemic,” was published in the Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization on July 24, 2021. Publisher Elsevier has partnered with the Copyright Center RightsLink service to offer various options for reusing this content. Elsevier offers open or restricted access to content with permanently unique identifiers to include links and citations. This paper is an independent article focusing on the state of the public economy during COVID-19. In their paper, the authors examine changes in the perception of inflation during the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although this paper is an independent work, Armantier et al. (2021) complemented other research in the field analyzing economic changes during the COVID-19 recession. A feature of the article is the study by the authors of the consequences of inflationary crises and comparison with pre-existing crises to calculate the level of the crisis as a whole. The survey’s main purpose is to collect against a wide range of economic outcomes. As a result of their research, the authors studied the evolution of households’ perceptions of inflation and concluded that the growth of inflationary expectations was more restrained. It means that the muted reaction of average inflation expectations masks a significant polarization of views, especially in the short term (Bekaert et al., 2020). A significant proportion of households, particularly those with higher education, initially expected that the pandemic would lead to low inflation or even deflation (Armantier et al., 2021). Thus, the authors achieved their goal and confirmed their results with numerous graphs and tables presented in the article. I liked the study by Armantier et al. (2021) because the authors look at non-traditionally triggered crises and household responses. In addition, through comparative analysis with past crises, Armantier et al. (2021) determine the spread of the crisis due to erroneous assumptions about inflation to other areas of the economy (Armantier et al., 2021). For example, the Great Recession was predominantly a strong negative demand shock driven by a falling house and stock prices. I also liked that the authors found evidence for strong polarization of inflation perceptions and identified differences between demographic groups.",
    "With the widespread use of digital technology, email has gained particular importance. With email, communication has become much easier, as people have been able to communicate with colleagues, relatives, loved ones, and business partners and representatives of organizations, literally in real-time, avoiding all the difficulties of “physical” communication. However, what is interesting is a study of the extent to which such communication has been modified with the advent of the phenomenon of email. In the context of interpersonal communication, two effects should be highlighted. First, email has meaningfully broadened the scope of communication so that communication is no longer only realized in the real world but can easily be continued online as well. This has changed the perception of interpersonal communication and greatly simplified the availability of communication. Meanwhile, email has changed the perception of nonverbal communication through emotions and body language, since in text correspondence, especially of a business nature, such expressions of speech do not make sense (Smith, n.d.). Of course, there are alternatives in the form of emoji and stickers, but in emails, as a rule, such forms are rarely used, unlike in messengers. From these features, an essential advantage of email is highlighted, namely increased accessibility, the possibility of virtually limitless communication, and staying connected with people at all times. However, there are also disadvantages: dependence on Internet equipment, the need for an electronic device, and any cybersecurity concerns. It is easy to make mistakes in electronic correspondence, as individuals automatically try to extrapolate real-world communication skills to the digital world. These mistakes include ignoring the type of interlocutor and lack of digital etiquette, mixing up writing styles, and sending long, unstructured messages (CNBC, 2018). To avoid making these mistakes in everyday correspondence, it is advisable to learn the rules of electronic etiquette, review your messages before sending, the appropriateness of using slang and style for specific interlocutors and reducing the letter to the minimum size that retains meaning.",
    "Despite numerous calls to concentrate on customer satisfaction or improve work engagement, countless American corporate executives remain obsessed with their companies’ financial growth. Even so, making a profit is the only way the world can tell if a company is doing things correctly. Furthermore, if a company ceases to make money, it may cease operations entirely. Clearly, some businesses lack the financial resources to fully capitalize on available product market growth opportunities. Others do not have opportunities that are commensurate with their financial means. Sources of finance and product-market opportunities influence how quickly a company can grow. To understand how fast a company should grow, a manager must first investigate the relationship between “inflation, capital costs, profitability, growth, and the market value of a company’s common stock” (Fruhan, 2014, para. 4). The profitability of a company depends on two factors: the expected return on equity (ROE) and the cost of capital. If ROE is predicted to surpass the cost of equity capital, more growth will only have a positive impact on the business’s operations and health. On the other hand, if ROE is not expected to exceed the cost of capital, then the company should consider a strategy of rapid negative growth. Insufficient earnings combined with the necessity to do little more than finance inflation-induced revenue growth can be devastating for the firm’s value (Fruhan, 2014). Businesses in this situation should contemplate a rapid slowing growth program if they are unable to increase revenue. However, in order to maintain properly set growth, a company must meet inflation expectations and even surpass the inflation rate. For example, if an inflation rate is 10%, the company must not only maintain its earnings to beat the inflation rate but try to achieve higher results. According to the statistics provided by Dow Jones, between 1965 and 1981, the inflation rate increased dramatically each year (Fruhan, 2014). Therefore, while Treasury bonds yield about 11%, overall long-term inflation expectations equal 10% (Fruhan, 2014). This means that companies must grow fast enough to keep the cost of equity capital for common stock at 19–20%. Hence, a business should grow according to the inflation rate and other indicators. This way, in order to remain lucrative to investors, an organization needs to beware of a long-term inflation rate. While Treasury bonds are predicted to yield 10% annually, companies need to provide a premium of 9–10%, which in the end equals 19–20% growth. If a company cannot meet the expectations of investors and surpass the inflation rate, it is doomed. Moreover, a company needs to check its ROE and the cost of equity capital. When the former surpasses the latter, a company will be able to create ample growth. When a business fails to oversee these two points and grows more rapidly than it can manage, it can do more harm to its financial health.",
    "The chapter in question tells the story of how global trade has enriched and changed cultures. During the analyzed period, many wealthy rulers and merchants began to demonstrate their power by acquiring exotic works of art. Ideas and books circulated, and cultural exchange was extremely active. People became more tolerant of diversity and more aware of how diverse the world around them was. Ties between different cultures were strengthened because of the continuing strong globalization. European influence had spread so far that the norms and habits of people from the West were beginning to be considered universal and objective (Adelman et al., 2021, p. 597). The key term of the era becomes the Enlightenment, marking a period of triumph of human reason. People begin to think that they can understand the laws of nature and human behavior. The importance of the chapter lies in its multifaceted analysis of the period, taking into account the contribution of each continent. Among the major events, the book describes is how the three great powers formed a group in West and South Asia. The author describes how the rulers of the Ottoman, Safavid, and Mughal dynasties contributed to the cultural development of their countries. The development of China, Japan, the two Americas, the slave states of Africa, and the development of Australia are also narrated. Particular emphasis is placed on how the interaction and mutual influence of different cultures contributed to their overall development. The sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries saw a global cultural renaissance brought on by the growth of new wealth (Adelman et al., 2021, p. 595). There was an increase in the consumption of books, and a greater number of previously unseen monuments were formed (Adelman et al., 2021, p. 595). The world has become highly integrated due to the spread of international trade. However, not all countries were willing to change and only agreed to adapt to the new norms. The Islamic and Chinese worlds generally maintained their identities, but America and Oceania could not resist European cultural pressure.",
    "Summary Today opioids are the most commonly used drug in the United States. For a long time, opiates have been used as effective pain relievers, but their relaxing effects started making people abuse them recreationally. Opioids cause a strong feeling of euphoria, which leads to the risk of using recreational substances. Addicted people have a constant desire to increase the dose, which is a severe medical and social problem. The United States is facing one of the worst drug crises in history. More than half of deaths are associated with prescription opioids: heroin and fentanyl (Coon et al., 2022). The number has risen nationwide amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The crisis has acquired enormous proportions and become a brake on the economy and a threat to national security. Forms of Treatment Available to those Suffering from Opioid Addiction The most effective way to overcome opioid addiction is recognized as “substitution therapy”. This approach involves using a drug with less addictive potential as a legal alternative to heroin and other highly addictive drugs. Three substances are currently approved for substitution therapy: methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone (Volkow et al., 2014). Medications are determined with cautiousness to avoid unwanted psychoactive effects. For example, a significant disadvantage of methadone is its ability to provoke a strong withdrawal syndrome in case of discontinuation of its use. To alleviate the patient’s condition, doctors can resort to additional help with tranquilizers, antidepressants, antipsychotics, and non-opioid analgesics. In addition, doctors widely use symptomatic treatment and supportive therapy (Volkow et al., 2014). In the severe phase of withdrawal, the patient should be under constant medical supervision. Helping a Friend or a Family Member with an Opioid Addiction The most important aspect of the treatment motivation is the family. It is necessary to help a person acquire a sincere desire to battle for life. Rehab centers remain an effective chance for an addicted person to return to a healthy, drug-free life. It uses a unique rehabilitation program that allows one not only to overcome addiction but to return to a healthy lifestyle and realize its value (Brown, 2018). To provide effective motivation, the psychiatrist should learn all the necessary data about the addicted person. It will require the assistance of relatives and friends who can tell about the psychological atmosphere, patients’ habits, interests, and family relationships.",
    "Social responsibility entails policies that organizations put in place as part of a company’s governance projected to ensure the corporate’s functions are effective and beneficial to all stakeholders. These guidelines help protect the environment, improve the quality of life for societies, and provide a conducive working environment through recognizing and appreciating talented and hardworking employees. This increases customer loyalty as clients feel they are helping the business support worthy initiatives, thus, enabling more access to funds and allowing more investors to join and support the company. The business rewards employees through meaningful praises, which makes them appreciated. It provides workers a chance to lead by example while giving them the capacity to make decisions without interference, demonstrating that they are trusted and capable (Yang et al., 2019). Additional monetary motivations comprise yearly or semi-yearly bonuses. Additionally, paid time-off and cash prizes help to boost performance while encouraging feelings. The company exercises CSR by adopting a business code of ethics, which shapes workers’ behavior on morals, standards, environment, self-esteem, and customer service. The organization has established dependable systems to protect staff and avoid accidents and injuries (Tamvada, 2020). It also ensures suppliers are aware of and meet the expectations of responsible conduct concerning issues such as affordable costs. For instance, screening dealers to define their past behavior and discuss what the company expects. The only change in CSR that I would suggest is how the organization handles employees’ creativity. I would encourage the company to set a stage for brainstorming, thus, encouraging new ideas and creativity (Tamvada, 2020). Regarding complaints about the company engagement and expenditures, it is evident that the business is striving to improve CSR, and the further it advances in that direction, the more it benefits. For instance, experiencing more brand recognition means increases in sales. Nestle has endeavored to become a socially responsible and environmentally sustainable corporation. Thus, it qualifies for a pass because of its tremendous achievement in empowering communities. It has improved people’s living standards, creating access to hygiene and clean water and motivating populations to live healthy lifestyles. I would recommend the company implement an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process (Tamvada, 2020). ERM should be applied since it is designed to find possible events that can affect the business. This will also help manage risks and opportunities and develop meaningful assurance concerning company objectives.",
    "The secret of IKEA’s success on the global market lies in its perfect execution of all components of the marketing mix. The company has adapted its strategy to each market with precision, flexibility, and creativity that made its products highly recognized. The ingenuity of its marketing mix proposal can serve as an example for other companies in Europe and worldwide. In this paper, the four components of IKEA’s marketing mix will be discussed. This Swedish company has gained renown for the quality, accessibility, and innovativeness of its products. First of all, the firm’s pricing strategy is focused on affordability, as the structure and logistics of its stores are optimized for a maximum price reduction (O’Neill, 2021). Promotions of this store chain are widespread through all communication channels, ranging from local radio stations to social media accounts made for each region individually. IKEA stays on top of modern advertising strategies and employs influencers to reach younger audiences (O’Neill, 2021). Regarding its locations, IKEA continuously selects places where it will remain accessible for the public while keeping its prices at the lowest. However, the most notable feature of this company is its products. Its home furniture is easy to recognize for its style, modularity, and reusability (O’Neill, 2021). There is a constant stream of new products in IKEA, giving customers a reason to keep visiting it on a regular basis. In conclusion, IKEA’s marketing mix shows how affordable, stylish, and recognizable products are able to capture customers’ hearts and solidify a company’s success for decades to come. There is a piece of furniture for every need and every customer’s taste, as their modularity enables creativity beyond compare. IKEA’s drive to provide its customers with products they desire gave it an immense competitive advantage in Europe and worldwide.",
    "Neil Foley talks about the role of Mexican Americans in the history of the U.S. in Mexicans in the Making of America. The author gave his view of these events in the first chapter, “The Genesis of Mexican America,” where he presented the history of the appearance of Mexican Americans and the silent conflict between the two countries. The author’s central claim is that the American government created an image of lazy Mexican immigrants who cross the border to murder and sell illicit drugs; this stigmatization affected Mexican Americans, too (Foley 34). However, the truth was that white settlers from the southern states were illegal invaders in Texas in the 1830s because they refused to obey the country’s laws (Imery-Garcia 12). Discrimination against Mexican immigrants and citizens was rooted in the 1846-1848 war and the treaty’s approval, which included Texas and Mexican people living there into the U.S. territory and being denied their rights. It was interesting to learn from this chapter the viewpoint of many people in the United States about Mexico as a country of cruel and uneducated people. Indeed, it points to the erased memory of the Aztec Empire, the abolition of slavery in Mexico much earlier than in the U.S., and the annexation of Texas. The 1846-1848 war between the two countries was an unfair, violent act of the U.S. government towards a weaker neighbor, which suffered economic downfall at that time (Foley 24). The new legislation after the war gave people the choice of returning to Mexico or becoming U.S. citizens with formally equal rights that were not respected in reality (Gutiérrez 5). Therefore, most of them wanted to be viewed as Spanish Americans rather than people of Mexican descent to avoid stigmatization. I agree with the author’s final point that this historical event created not only a political border between two neighbors but caused subsequent misunderstandings in the relationships between the two nations. In summary, the first chapter in Foley’s Mexicans in the Making of America talks about the origin of Mexican Americans. Specifically, it analyzed the role of the war between Mexico and the U.S. for Texas’s territory in the future political climate between these countries. Overall, the annexation of Texas damaged the relations between them, resulting in the negative perception of Mexican immigrant workers and the desire of Mexican Americans to hide their ancestry.",
    "When many people have a chance to interact simultaneously, especially in learning settings, it may easily lead to the occurrence of conflicts and arguments. The talkative or negative members undoubtedly impact the atmosphere within the team (Jacobs et al., 2016). It seems that “the show-off” might negatively influence the moods of all the members, considering that it is easy to get irritated by such a type of behavior (Jacobs et al., 2016). In addition, show-offs’ aim is to impress people around them, especially a group leader, and to do so, they usually opt for talking without a stop or boasting, which distracts other members. It is a common issue in group settings as such members desire to attract attention to themselves as they might be insecure or not confident in themselves. That is why the show-offs tend to answer all the questions, even those that are not directed at them. Moreover, they can attract a leader’s attention by asking irrelevant or off-topic questions. As a matter of fact, non-stop talking may be an obstacle for reaching a productive learning atmosphere as, eventually, people will be irritated and not have acquired any helpful knowledge during the lesson. The constant involvement of the show-offs in the educational process is likely to annoy other members so that they will develop hatred for such type of behavior (Forsyth, 2019). Furthermore, the show-offs can easily prevent the group from reaching the set aim by distracting them through their foolery and over-involvement in the whole process. Overall, such members can harm the group’s productivity and effectiveness in learning as they opt for attracting all the attention to themselves without giving other individuals opportunities to realize their potentials within the settings.",
    "The airline industry has been hit particularly hard by Covid 19. The virus outbreak has caused the governments of most countries to implement restrictions on traveling (Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Aviation, 2022). Thus, the regulatory implementations have negatively affected the standard revenue, business practices, and practices of airline companies. First, passengers were less keen to travel due to the testing regulations, limited resources, and the lack of need to travel for work. Another cause was the regulation themselves that implied a reduction in Covid-19 cases through quarantine measures. The low demand has caused the airlines to lose revenue ($372 bn), which was an unprecedented change in the industry (Economic impacts of covid-19 on Civil Aviation, 2021). Flights were being canceled, and employees were laid off due to the challenging situation in which the corporations could not sustain airports with such a low passenger rate. The airline companies have experienced major economic challenges that have been facilitated by all the negative implications of the pandemic on civil aviation. As a result, fewer seats were being offered (-50%), and fewer passengers were able to travel via plane (-2,7 bn) (Economic impacts of covid-19 on Civil Aviation, 2021). The effect was slightly balanced out due to the fact that cargo flights have been less impacted or even increased in rates due to the transportation of medical supplies (Nižetić, 2020, p. 10953). However, as vaccines became available and fewer restrictions were put in place, the situation has changed for the better in 2021. More opportunities have occurred due to the less rigid regulatory implementations, vaccination, and other beneficial factors. As exemplified in the relevant literature, the lost revenue in 2021 was slightly lower ($324 Bn). Even though these figures look dismal, the year 2021 has seen a slight improvement, with the years to come sure to be better and better.",
    "The researchers base their conclusion on three well-designed case studies touching on various software applications. The case studies include evaluating bone fractures following traffic accidents, bone injuries caused by a spade, and gunshot wounds on the head, which offer valuable data on enhancing contemporary forensic investigations (Buck et al., 2008). The modeling software and haptic device used for the study boast high precision, low friction, superior fidelity, and output capacity of six degrees of freedom. In the present world, these are top-notch specifications for such discourses. However, replicating the study to verify the findings may prove a challenge due to the high cost of assembling all the specimens and equipment utilized therein (Pinzon et al., 2016). The researchers do well to draw their interpretations and conclusions from the gathered data involving the three separate case studies cited above. The results of the studies indicate that haptic devices can prove very valuable in post-mortem and forensic investigations. In forensic science, the research can be instrumental in enabling investigators to recreate a crime scene (such as gun-holding position) and identify the object used in the crime with enhanced precision and speed. Hagmann et al. (2021) thus note that the use of haptics in forensic science can hasten the criminal justice process and make investigations more reliable. The research is highly innovative as it facilitates the use of technology to recreate crime scenes and enables the user to get the sense of touch often lost during such virtual excursions. Thus, the user can handle and feel 3D digital information, which is significant innovation and improves current technologies. According to Joukal et al. (2015), there may arise controversies surrounding the use of haptics due to fears of corrupting operating systems and online hacking to manipulate investigation findings. Such possibilities may impact the reliability of such devices in criminal justice proceedings. In terms of ethics, the machines make investigations much more expensive to conduct due to costly equipment and training for personnel involved (Fahrni et al., 2019). The costs may hinder the quest for justice in some cases, primarily in low-income areas. Nevertheless, the innovation is evident, and the researchers do well to draw solid conclusions based on their three well-designed case studies.",
    "The origins of slavery in the American territories and why it came to be From 1526 until 1776, complex pressures shaped the structure of slavery in the United States, and historians have proposed multiple ideas to explain how slave trade evolved. Slavery was strongly related to labor demand in European colonies, particularly in the Caribbean and South America’s labor-intensive sugar plantation industries of Great Britain, Spain, France, and the Dutch Republic. Slave ships transported captives from Africa to the West and indigenous peoples were enslaved in North American colonies on a smaller scale (OpenStax, 2019). However, Indian slavery effectively stopped in the late eighteenth century. How slavery was handled differently in each colonial territory of British North America Enslaved people worked in various sectors, including breweries, shipyards, plantations, and timber yards. In the regions north of Maryland, slavery would gradually give way to free labor. The slave population in the North progressively fell throughout the 1760s and 1770s with slaves in Philadelphia reducing to approximately 700 in 1775 (OpenStax, 2019). Antislavery activism was rife in the city, with nationalist pamphleteers handing out antislavery booklets to blacks and whites. The presence of antislavery groups facilitated the spread of manumissions thus slavery became less viable in the North. New York had a high percentage of slaves who acquired valuable trades such as masonry and goldsmithing working alongside artisan masters. All slaves in New York were freed in 1827 (OpenStax, 2019) despite the liberation sentiment in the North during the Revolutionary battle. The contrasts between indentured servants and slaves Indentured service varied from enslavement in that it was a type of debt servitude where an agreed-upon period of unpaid service that often covered the servant’s costs of immigration to America. Indentured workers were not awarded incomes, although they were housed, clothed, and nourished in most cases. Slaves were deemed property and were only awarded freedom on rare occasions despite several years of strenuous labor (Gabor, 2021). Slaves were sold, exchanged, negotiated for, and even utilized as property in a will.",
    "The issue of tribal sovereignty has been scrutinized over the years, the treatment of tribes ranging from supportive measures and attempts of integration into the broader community to outright persecution. In this connection, the law about tribal gaming can be seen as a positive step towards recognition of tribes’ unique way of life and self-determination. This essay discusses the question “how tribal gaming act can add to the sovereignty of tribes?” Under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, tribes were given the right to determine what gaming activities they wanted to engage in, and in most cases, the permission was granted by the state. Gaming activities could embrace tribal rituals or games of chance, depending on the wishes of the tribes and had to be agreed to by the state (Light and Rand). Since often tribal games are unique and have a deep meaning for the tribe, it would be right to say that granting tribes the right to hold their own games is necessary. This measure helps to uphold their culture and establish sovereignty over a very important sphere of life, which is relaxation. Moreover, gaming helps to support traditions and customs through rituals that have been molded over the centuries. As far as sovereignty is concerned, gaming serves to establish the spheres of life which are completely under the tribes’ jurisdiction. Thus, for example, some tribe members mix with the society at large, finding employment or integrating themselves in the life of big cities. However, gaming, and in particular traditional tribal gaming, serves as a reminder of one’s roots, promotes freedom of choice and sovereignty as it is the one thing that is almost completely under the tribes’ jurisdiction.",
    "Individual freedoms and national security are sometimes seen as two opposites. However, in ideal, national security should reflect the balanced relationship between the two mentioned concepts. Moreover, the principle of the prevalence of individual freedoms over the national security underlies the democratic idea. Individual freedoms include individual rights and are protected by the US Constitution (Longley). This paper argues that individual freedoms should never be sacrificed in the name of national security. This essay proposes that the protection of individual freedoms by maintaining national security is a fundamental principle and goal of democracy. US President Joe Biden notes, “I strongly believe that democracy is the key to freedom, prosperity, peace, and dignity” (Biden 3). Unlike authoritarian or totalitarian systems, a democratic system puts individual freedoms ahead of national security interests. The implementation of this principle always raises controversy, since there is no single rule universal for all cases. However, individual freedoms are protected in most areas of social life, including migration, cyber security, economic stability, and international diplomatic relations. Interestingly, actual cyber security policy and practice take both human-centric and national-security-centric approaches (Deibert 411). In this regard, the states develop “indivisible network security on a planetary scale for the widest possible coverage of the human experience” (Deibert 412). The above example indicates the breadth of possibilities for applying the principle. There is probably a counter-argument against the opinion that national security interests should take precedence over individual freedoms. This position can be justified by an external threat or military ambitions and is usually applied by authoritarian regimes. This position is wrong since national security should protect the interest of every citizen, not the abstract idea of the nation. Every citizen is part of the nation and their freedoms should be sacred. Thus, it was discussed, how individual freedoms should never be sacrificed in the name of national security. The necessity to sacrifice individual freedoms is usually promoted by authoritarian regimes whose real purpose is to meet the interests of the regime. On the contrary, in democratic states, individual freedoms are fundamental and cannot be violated under any circumstances. These freedoms are sacred and ensure the integrity of the democratic states.",
    "Elements Diamonds by Rihanna was first heard on Elvis Duran Show on September 26, 2012, availed for online download an hour after being released to the public, and was released as the album’s lead single the following day. Sia wrote the song for Rihanna, who holds the song’s copyrights and worked on it a year prior; therefore, the song is owned by an independent contractor (Anggraini 12). Unapologetic is Barbadian artist Rihanna’s seventh studio album, and the song “Diamonds” appears on it (Anggraini 7). Using Sia’s demo vocals as a guide, Rihanna imitated her inflections to the precise tiniest detail. It was only after Benny Blanco heard the finished track to the Australian songwriter did, she realize the vocals belonged to her alone. Inspiration In Diamonds , Rihanna contemplated the existence of both love and diamonds: “Yellow diamonds in the light. To make things even more awkward, we’re standing next to each other. You cross my path as your shadow does.” The diamonds in the song symbolize a silver lining that illustrates the chance for a better future and happier days among dark and depressing days. The song made me think about all the possibilities available when things do not turn out to be as I expected. I also chose the song because its presentation, which was both positive and hopeful, and I am always in a good mood when I listen to it. It is also quite inspirational because it encourages listeners to love themselves. Since its launch, the song has won multiple awards and has enjoyed massive success for years. For Rihanna’s career, the song gave a great boost because it was quite catchy and everyone could recognize it from the very first minutes of it playing.",
    "Different circumstances under which medical staff has worked led to varying types of leadership strategies being developed. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the role of clear communication and the handling of prompt preparation in top healthcare leaders (Nicola et al., 2020). Another key tactic includes the use of external change agents that ultimately promote excellent organizational decision-making (Alagoz et al., 2018). Moreover, one study explained how implementing positivity-related and open-minded approaches as leaders can improve their employee’s resilience, providing an additional source of motivation (Wei et al., 2018). Hence, effective healthcare leaders must adapt to various external changes and strategically communicate with their coworkers. Several departments can be interacted with through the role of a healthcare administrator. One of them includes the in-patient department where multiple approaches from skilled professionals are needed. Moreover, critical care and A&E require excellent management and collaborating opportunities. As already mentioned, the selected healthcare areas are prime examples of fields requiring strong leaders to provide optimal patient care. One way this can be improved to obtain the desired outcomes is through a holistic approach that considers external and internal factors. Furthermore, collective decision-making should not be viewed as limiting to effective leadership; on the contrary, it presents an ideal strategy in healthcare management. The importance of interprofessional collaboration in medical institutions is evident through its effect on patient outcomes. Research has demonstrated significant changes in healthcare conditions after the implementation of the strategy (Spaulding et al., 2018). The method involves acquiring knowledge from colleagues and incorporating it into one’s practice, seeking advice from the respective medical staff. Therefore, the strategy impacts the range of services professionals can offer to their patients and should be worked on further to improve its practicality.",
    "Net Present Value (NPV) reflects the amount of cash an investor or funder expects to receive from a project after inflows are recouped through all sorts of costs. This figure can be understood as the investor’s total profit generated once the payback begins. NPV gives a clear indication of whether a project is worth investing in based on likely costs and potential risk. NVP has many more advantages over other investment criteria. The rules that apply to NVP include common sense and the reasonableness of the investment and take into account return criteria. Since the calculation of NVP involves a time horizon, it is already profitable over static measures. Accordingly, the first advantage of NVP is its connection to the idea of an expected value, which will be less than at the time of investment. Unlike the payback period, NVP recognizes that the value of a currency is temporary and subject to change, so it lays this metric into the calculation of discount rates. Assumptions about the cost of capital allow the NVP to be calculated and suggest a strategy for profitable ways to implement the project. Consequently, the second advantage of this criterion is flexibility and additivity, that is, understanding the benefits of all available projects or one specific one. A third advantage may be that the calculation of NVP considers the size of the investment. This means that NVP is a unidimensional criterion that allows us to estimate the degree of probability of wealth creation based on the number of cash flows. Thus, NVP has several advantages over other investment criteria based on its application. First, NVP considers the present value of money, which gives a clear picture of cash transactions. Second, it is flexible and additive, meaning it evaluates the cost of capital and the appropriateness of the investment. Third, NVP is a one-dimensional indicator that considers all, even space investments.",
    "To properly manage business outputs, it is crucial to examine the external environment of the industry in question. The 7-Eleven organization could greatly benefit from implementing the I/O Model of Above-Average Returns, which relies on the examination of the firm’s external conditions. As such, the first stage involves the analysis of the industry and competitor environment, creating a clear picture of the general atmosphere (Hitt et al., 2007). For the 7-Eleven corporation, the competitors are such large-scale convenience stores as Walmart and Target. However, as the overall industry grows and generates a significant amount of revenue, it creates a positive atmosphere for further development. Another factor to consider is the industry’s attractiveness, as it must possess a high potential for the firm to generate above-average returns. In the current age, the convenience store segment is considered exceptionally beneficial for securing above-average returns due to the increasing demand for large-scale product distribution shops (Graves, 2017). The demand for the variety of choices and the improving financial position of American citizens suggest that the industry’s structural characteristics are quite favorable. After that, 7-Eleven would be required to select a strategy that would ensure the provision of above-average returns. A promising approach could be the implementation of the chain store method, where several branches are established across different countries. However, to apply this technique, particular assets and skills are needed (Hitt et al., 2007). The first criterion is the possession of the products and resources necessary to launch an international branch, as the costs of sustaining a new location in a different country can be demanding (Graves, 2017). In addition, the executives must account for the economic environment of the chosen state, meaning that it is vital to be skilled in international trade and branch management. Finally, to implement the selected approach, it is necessary to establish which actions will be performed to achieve the above-average returns. For 7-Eleven, it would be beneficial to use the company’s strengths in this endeavor, namely the existence of other international branches and the successful history of operations in the US (Lee, 2021). By relying on the previously obtained knowledge and integrating global expansion into the organization’s goals, 7-Eleven might perfectly utilize the formulated strategy and earn above-average returns.",
    "The suggested strategies to mitigate the effects of coronavirus in accordance with the example of Iceland could be considered as an interesting approach. This strategy acknowledges its apparent limitations, such as the resilience of the Iceland community, geographical idiosyncrasy. However, currently, this strategy might not be a valid method to address the high margins of infected individuals in NATO countries. It is certainly true that quick response and high testing rates would contribute to the deterrence of the effects imposed by the sudden growth of the number of infected. However, it is similarly meaningful that the population would be willing to undergo such a measure. Moreover, despite the financial support efforts, some countries belonging to the organization might not be able to financially withstand the high amount of testing imposed by the new waves of infection. This fact is especially relevant given that the virus dissemination might emerge across several countries simultaneously. Therefore, a different approach to the problem might be necessary. The Israeli government approached the problem of monitoring the infected with the creative solution of digital epidemiological investigation (Amit et al., 2020). This technology allowed tracking potential contacts of people that were infected and act accordingly (Amit et al., 2020). However, it is arguable that this methodology could address the geographical limitations introduced in the case of Iceland. It would be difficult for NATO countries to strictly monitor all entrances to their borders. Therefore, an analog in the form of digital tracking may solve the problem with the need for strict borders control and provide necessary tools for timely reaction to the new outbreaks. Nevertheless, it would require funds both internal and external in order to build new or reconstruct the existing infrastructure for the stated purposes.",
    "The introduced Canadian perspective on the provisional agenda of the North Atlantic Council seems to cover key points that concern Canadian security. Increased presence in the world peace operations and maintenance of tight relationships with other NATO members, especially remarkable is the smart defense approach that considers the military and economic needs of Canada. Although, it is difficult to judge the extent of the Syrian threat to Canadian interest during the outbreak of coronavirus, which seems to continue even today. Therefore, it would be essential to review the proposed question for a more effective approach to the defense of Canadian interests. Nevertheless, this act protects the interest of both Israel and Canada and will positively impact their relationship. Furthermore, it is notable how the Canadian government is willing to cooperate with the withdrawal of troops from Iraq if the official request were to be made. This statement in itself is probably a contribution to the international image of Canadian humanitarianism, but the extent of such image improvement is questionable. The focus on building trading relationships and close ties with other NATO countries could be seen as the most important aspect that Israel might acknowledge. Israel’s national security has experienced decades of varying threats, which included terrorism, missiles, and existential nuclear dangers (Freilich, 2018). However, the former national security strategy (NSS) is non-existent in the country as the first document of NSS was developed in 1953 (Freilich, 2018). Nevertheless, the country is more secure than ever before due to the political and military bonds it forms active trade agreements with various powerful countries such as the USA, China, Russia, Germany, Canada, Poland, and India (Freilich, 2018). Currently, the country exhibits great regional power and is able to prosper due to the seven-decades-old strategy.",
    "The current issue with Nike stems from its corrupt corporate culture, which puts women in a position of weakness. It allows powerful men in charge of the company to abuse and suppresses them, preventing them from reaching the positions they deserve without being harassed or denigrated. There are four potential ways of dealing with a problem: absolving, solving, resolving, and dissolving (Ackoff, 2019). Given the scope and the long-term aims for Nike and society in general, the only acceptable solution would be to dissolve it. The process of dissolution revolves around removing the underlying causes for the problem to exist in the first place. Absolving means ignoring the problem, solving – giving the women that were harmed some sort of compensation without making changes, and resolving – giving them the means to fight back without actively trying to change the toxic culture towards something better (Singh, 2018). Just allowing women to fight back is not enough – Nike should make it so that they do not have to. From an organizational framework perspective, the transformation of Nike’s culture should be done on all levels, from top to bottom. If harassment, cronyism, and corruption are acceptable at the top, there is nothing to stop them from occurring at the bottom levels (Singh, 2018). Therefore, Parker and the rest of Nike’s leadership must implement policies and solutions on all levels. This involves disincentivizing such behavior and ensuring that any potential sources of it are extinguished before they could take root again. The proposed plan of action, thus, is to conduct a massive revision of every individual employee and manager to determine their complicity in the acts that have been perpetrated in Nike for ages. All individuals found complicit should be removed from the company. That includes Mr. Parker and the rest of the board themselves, as they have been benefitting from the system while closing their eyes on it. The new leadership would be the one to implement and install a new culture based on equality, capability, and diversity.",
    "The deep socio-economic divides in American society have impacted the unemployment rates even before the COVID-19 pandemic; however, the virus has exacerbated the issue. There have been two distinct experiences during the pandemic: first, people with graduate education, who kept stable jobs through working remotely; second, those who either lost or got reduced in their jobs with no safety net (Blustein et al., 2020). The key determinants of work availability are power and privilege, unevenly divided across racial, gender, and education lines (Blustein et al., 2020). The national socio-economic gaps lie between those who have a college education and those who do not (Galea & Abdalla, 2020). Within the framework of education access, race and ethnicity represent a major division plane between Americans. The black demographic faces racism in hiring, seeking housing, and everyday life, resulting in systemic marginalization (Galea & Abdalla, 2020). Therefore, the issue of unequal job availability persists, with racial divides being particularly striking recently. Discerning socio-economic groups’ post-pandemic recovery rates from April 2020 paints a clear picture. The divide is demonstrated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (2022): there seems to be an improvement post-pandemic, with the average unemployment rate decreasing from 14.7% in April 2020 to 4% now. However, for the black population, the unemployment rate reached 16.8% in April 2020; later, stalled at 10.9% in October 2020 and then only lowered to 6.9% in January 2022 (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2022). In contrast, the white demographic presents a steady decrease within six months from April 2020; by October 2020, unemployment more than halved from 14.1% to 6.0%. Higher education, stable jobs, and support networks contribute to the higher-than-average unemployment rates for the black demographic (Galea & Abdalla, 2020). This statistic demonstrates the uneven struggle to recover from the pandemic-induced and general unemployment.",
    "Considerable musicians have represented soul music, and James Brown was one of the most prominent. Southern soul became extremely popular towards the end of the 1960s, and Brown had his first success in 1956 (Covach and Flory 218). Initially, Brown worked as a stand-in for Little Richard, and his first record, “Please Please Please,” was quite thriving (Covach and Flory 240-241). Brown used to sing lead vocals, and his early musical style resembled that of the 1950s doo-wop (Covach and Flory 242). However, he began to develop the soul style in 1960 with “Think,” characterized by horns and a driving rhythm section (Covach and Flory 242). In 1964, Brown introduced “Out of Sight,” which represented the hard-driving soul style featured in his later songs towards the 1970s (Covach and Flory 242). James Brown was one of the performers who took control of their music, as he united an aggressive style of vocal and dance performance, production skills, and understanding of business (Covach and Flory 242). Brown’s musical style through the 1960s and into the 1970s changed from following prior era’s themes to creating his unique sounds. As Brown was searching for and evolving his individual style, his career differed from Motown, Stax, or Atlantic artists and led him to produce distinguishable songs. For instance, the stops at the end of the verses in Brown’s “Papa’s Got a Brand New Bag, Pt. 1” distinct the music from a Stax arrangement (Covach and Flory 243). At the same time, the absence of background vocals in the song varies from Motown’s approach (Covach and Flory 243). Moreover, James Brown’s music was highly famous within the Black community, as, unlike Motown and Atlantic artists, Brown expressed apparent racial pride through hard-edged musical style and political lyrics (Covach and Flory 244). Brown acted passionately on his live shows as a singer, dancer, and bandleader but also hired notable musicians and rehearsed them tirelessly (Covach and Flory 240). James Brown was a remarkable performer whose vision of music and societal norms differed from other professionals.",
    "Janina’s language in the novel Drive Your Plow over the Bones of the Dead is unique in many ways, as she unravels the mystery surrounding not only the murders but her personality. However, one of the most notable traits that the reader may notice on the first page is Janina’s use of nicknames as substitutes for any person or animal’s name. While many people use nicknames for friends or people they dislike, Janina’s approach is built on her feelings towards her name and names in general. She states, “I believe each of us sees the other person in our way, so we should give them the name we consider suitable.” She considers names “polyonymous” and adheres to this rule for every character she encounters. As a result, each person that Janina talks with or about is transformed into the characteristic she sees in them. Her friend is Oddball – and from the beginning, the reader has to inherently accept that this person may be strange somehow, although it may not be accurate. Similarly, the murder victims – Big Foot, Commandant, Inner – have to be seen as the traits of appearance or status they have in Janina’s eyes. In contrast, when Janina thinks about a name for a rescue dog, her first idea is a human name, Marysia. She denies other pet names, saying that “considering her personal history” they could not be suitable for the dog. Thus, Janina thinks deeply about the animal’s life and problems, basing the name on the dog’s condition and story. By looking at the contrast between names and nicknames that Janina uses for people and animals, one can see her actual values. She loves animals while humans get judged or excluded for their oddity. Therefore, while the narrator is untrustworthy, she quickly gives away her views on the murders and exposes her potential role in them. Her nature is to judge people for their treatment of animals, and the latter is perceived as better, more worthy of saving than humans.",
    "John Smeaton was an English engineer who designed bridges, canals, and lighthouses. In the given article, written by Andrew M. A. Morris, the author demonstrates how this renowned engineer employed parameter variation in a far more broad context as part of an analytical procedure (Morris, 2021). Morris stresses the three distinct goals of such a process, including optimization, theory testing, and maxim development through exploratory testing. As the writer puts it, the fundamental point of this study is that Smeaton accomplished more than enhanced engineering processes by systematizing prior artisanal ways, as was the traditional interpretation of Smeaton’s method established by technology analysts in the 1990s (Morris, 2021). Rather, he claims that his method creates a link between science and technology by including both theory testing and practical testing (Morris, 2021). I agree with the author and believe that John Smeaton was successful at performing the traditionally seen hypothesis testing and developed empirical regularities through exploratory experimentation. While some scholars might claim that no scientific research was involved in the work of Smeaton, the engineer managed to go through a thorough analysis and create his own maxims. Morris also discussed the relationship between science and technology during the Industrial Revolution. According to Morris, the conventional understanding of it was determined by two nearly obsolete historical studies, which are reflected in the discussion between A.E. Musson, and Eric Robinson, and A. Rupert Hall (Morris, 2021). According to the first two researchers, science was an essential aspect of the industrial Era (Morris, 2021). Hall, conversely, believes that the 18th-century technical innovations attributed almost nothing to the era’s science. The way I see it, Hall’s opinion does not have a solid ground. The Industrial Revolution, in my perspective, was an amalgam of technology, science, and industry. Significant breakthroughs and technical advancements shaped nearly every present field of people’s lives while also introducing a slew of new ones. It is well known that during the early stages of the Revolution, natural forms of energy, such as wind and water, were harnessed to generate electricity. However, later, new technologies, including steam power, were investigated and improved by John Smeaton, and electricity was critical in enabling the Industrial Revolution to flourish.",
    "The percentage of uninsured people in my state, Washington, is among the lowest. Particularly, it was 6.6% as of 2019, which is considerably lower than in Oklahoma (14.9%) or Texas (18.4%) (Kaiser Family Foundation, n.d.). In my opinion, the connection between the socioeconomic status and access to care is evident. The fewer opportunities a person has in terms of financial provision, the less possible it is for them to afford high-quality health care. Individuals with low income are highly likely to be uninsured or eligible for Medicaid. As a result, such citizens do not seek health care as often as it is needed. Frequently, they only address specialists in emergency cases, neglecting many other issues that require prevention or treatment. I think that the main reason why the percentage is low in my state is because of its geographic location. There are many job opportunities in the state of Washington, which means people can afford to pay for health insurance. Also, individuals living in this state are well-informed about their options regarding health needs. Apart from that, the number of healthcare facilities is much higher than, say, in rural areas. All of these factors contribute to the high level of insured people. Speaking about the gap in quality of care and access to health care, I should also note such factors as ethnic disparities, access to education, and community context. In my state, it is easier for people from diverse backgrounds to accommodate and find support. However, there are parts of the country where some ethnic groups might be accepted with prejudice, which makes it difficult for them to pursue high-quality education and find well-paid jobs.",
    "Kantian ethics is the clearest example of non-consequential theories in philosophy, and by extension, in law. Support for the theory often comes from adherents of imperative social order ideas such as utilitarianism. In Kant’s philosophy, the ideas of non-consequential ethics are most clearly demonstrated by the moral and ethical phenomenon he formulated and called the categorical imperative. This concept, as conceived by Kant, is the formulation of how a person should act, striving to partake in genuinely moral behavior (Kant & Abbott, 2021). The imperative directly addresses the acting person, who makes specific moral choices according to the predetermined rational ways. It advises a person to strictly and urgently, most attentively, treat the maxims of their behavior, namely to the subjective rules of practical reason. According to Kant, the principles of pure practical reason have a specific non-consequential form (Kant & Abbott, 2021). They are statements containing a general definition of will, which is subject to many practical rules; this notion has particular problems in the very essence of the statement. It should be discussed how Kant understands ethics in greater detail. Namely, morality should not be relative, bound by private interests, but absolute and universal; otherwise, it does not exist at all (Kant & Abbott, 2021). In other words, relativism is the enemy of genuine morality, the contingency of principles, and adaptation to the situation. In this aspect of Kant’s philosophy, the conflict between the fundamental, strictly necessary, universal moral law, which Kant defends, and the always determined circumstances, the actions of specific people, acquires a particularly sharp form. This conflict arises at the forefront of Kant’s non-consequential ethical position. After all, a specific person cannot live and act otherwise than focusing on circumstances, building their own subjective maxims of behavior. Perhaps they have no reason to be guided by universal morality, and in this case, the universal moral law–the categorical imperative–becomes just an idea and a chimera.",
    "Labor racketeering can be defined as the illegal use of unions and authority for self-interest. Union labor corruption was perpetrated by, performed in collaboration with, or under the direction of organized criminal syndicates. The beginning of the 20th century set the foundation for labor racketeering and became a law and societal concern (Jacobs, 2020). Until the late 1970s and early 1980s, there was no systematic governmental or enforcement agencies effort to mitigate the issue (Jacobs, 2020). During prohibition, criminal groups chose to generate profit from selling illicit spirits, which maintained the alcohol demand and earnings high. When prohibition was abolished in the 1930s, the mafia’s advanced business-running methods remained (Jacobs, 2020). The most potent groups turned their focus away from alcohol to business, including narcotics, gambling, and prostitution (Jacobs, 2020). However, these were not the only money-making businesses that contributed to the profit diversification. Among other beneficial businesses for the organized crime was labor racketeering through the control of labor unions. There are many reasons why gangs prefer labor unions to other kinds of unions. For example, it can be evident from their choice to control the Teamsters and International Longshoremen’s Association (Jacobs, 2020). With the sources of such unions, members of Cosa Nostra could easily access all kinds of legitimate businesses, including waste management, construction, or demolition. Moreover, they had easy access to healthcare and pension funds from the unions. These legitimate businesses offered them ways to not only traffick illicit substances or people but also cover up their actions (Jacobs, 2020). Among other crimes, the organized groups performed extortions or threatened employers, and solicited or received bribes. Hence, it can be seen that organized crime has always tried to control local businesses and expand their influence with the help of diversification of their profits. Among the main activities of gangs were prostitution, drug trafficking, gambling, and labor racketeering. Labor unions were beneficial to organized crime due to the sources they had. Such unions gave mobsters access to legitimate demolition, construction, and waste management businesses.",
    "There are many different scientific approaches to language studies; one of them is the prescriptive method. This principle can generally be described as a set of rules that prescribe speaking or writing. Crystal (1987) notes that prescriptivism is a perspective that chooses one of the interpretations of a language as the standard and extends it to the entire society. This variation is most often found in formal speech and literature. An alternative perspective is a descriptive approach based not on standards but on the actual situation. The proponent of this method simply describes the facts of linguistic variousness (Crystal, 1987). They act as an observer, not constrained by the official framework. Although these methods are opposite in meaning, each of them can be applied in the appropriate context. Crystal (1987) notes that exploring these methods often leads to an unrealistic depiction of the opposite side, the formation of prejudice and confrontation. However, both approaches should exist together, combining the positive aspects of each other. While the prescriptive approach allows the design of society to be arranged, the descriptive approach allows the recording of real language changes (Crystal, 1987). This, in turn, allows combining logic and the natural order of things. However, not all language changes are received positively due to misconceptions. The clearest example is the belief that change means deterioration, as the old generation constantly complains (Crystal, 1987). In addition, language changes are associated with a decline in the quality of education and the negative impact of the media. Nevertheless, the author selects sufficient counterarguments to all these fears. The elders are always resentful of change, as evidenced by historical correspondence. Deterioration in the quality of education and social tension arises only if these changes occur abruptly. Nevertheless, such cases are extremely rare, so I agree with these comments. As Crystal (1987) points out, it is common for the older generation to dislike the modern world, as evidenced by the literature. The influence of the media and the quality of education is not always necessarily linked to direct language changes. Therefore, my support for this position is based on the fact that people are usually afraid of change. Most people need the consistency of developed habits and methods in life. However, language change is a natural process that is not subject to official structures and is formed together with society and its most progressive members.",
    "Changes in the global management paradigm have affected one of the most important components of management – the leadership process. The technological and information revolution has led to the fact that most businesses have the ability to scale their activities to a global scale. This gave the leaders, on the one hand, the opportunity to enter global markets. On the other hand, it led to the need to design business changes in such a way that the company was ready to win against an unlimited number of competitors at every stage of development. This implies the first requirement for a future business leader: a company mission that does not provide for the pursuit of global leadership will not lead to success. Therefore, the design of change should be based on the goal of achieving global leadership, which refers primarily to cultural management skills. No one can deny the fact that cultural differences have a significant impact on the behavior and actions of a leader. Based on this, it becomes quite obvious that these differences are usually reflected in the ways of distributing working time, decision-making, and methods of motivation. The concept of leadership is an integral element in the system of international relations, which largely determines the course of the world’s political and economic processes. According to Ratanjee (2021), “the topic of developing a global mindset and exposing leaders to multicountry and multicultural experiences is gaining increasing interest” (pp. 2). It is clear that transformational leadership in the leadership process is strongly suggested for future leaders. Bonsu and Evans (2018) state that “embracing cross-cultural transformational leadership is strategic to business growth in an era of globalization, efficiency in technology and information dissemination, and parity of education and skills” (p. 50). With discernment and charisma, transformational leaders are able to inspire those around them to change their expectations and motivations in order to move towards higher goals.",
    "Goals and objectives outline desired outcomes and, thus, are often used interchangeably. However, the effect, timeframe, and specificity of the two terms set them apart. Nickels et al. (2019) define goals as broad and long-term outcomes that an organization seeks, while objectives define the measurable, specific, and short-term strategies for attaining the identified goal. For example, the criminal justice system uses goals to task the police, correctional agencies, and the court with the strategy to execute, including deterrence, rehabilitation, retribution, restoration, and incapacitation. Therefore, the criminal justice system particularly addresses criminal behavior with the objective of protecting people’s rights. In an era of rapid change, diversity, and complexity, leadership and management are critical to the survival of any agency. Besides, the ability to lead and manage strongly permeates every aspect of the criminal justice system. While leaders guide the change through a vision, managers implement coordinated processes and structures to pursue organizational goals and objectives (Nickels et al., 2019). Leaders are constantly challenged to take risks and encourage transformation. In law enforcement, for example, police leaders must develop and instill high standards in other officers to work toward the same goal. Beyond leadership, criminal justice relies on managers to optimize processes and lead efforts toward reliable outcomes. Generally, criminal justice leaders and managers work effectively to balance ethical and legal considerations. Earning a degree in criminal justice would significantly contribute to meeting my long-term goals. I have always taken pride in influencing change as a leader. However, I must leverage my education with experience in the criminal justice system to become more efficient and productive. The criminal justice system is becoming increasingly complex and requires more lasting and transformative trends. As such, the second goal is to become more adaptable to change. Bringing significant change through robust analytical skills is an objective in itself. Also, gaining strong relational skills to work with professionals and serve people from diverse backgrounds.",
    "The phrase that caught me most from the video is from Isaiah, stating that Samuel has taught him that one person can play t-ball and hit it hard when sitting down. This is a powerful statement indicating that people can be prejudiced despite having good intentions. Samuel’s family did not realize the struggles disabled people go through before he was born (PinehurstPictures, 2010). The child’s image hitting the t-ball also showcased a powerful issue, that disabled individuals should be treated similarly to other people and given equal opportunities to give them the chance to perform optimally. I was intrigued to see children like Nathanial Orellana learning in a normal classroom. His mother determined they sought school actively to ensure he received the best care considering his autism (PinehurstPictures, 2010). Parents face a myriad of extra challenges raising disabled children to give them advantages that would help them compete with their peers in society. The video illustrates that communities and the government should provide parents with a variety of schools to determine the best for their child’s disability. Children with disabilities require special care but should be allowed to interact with others if their illness would not worsen based on these connections. Engagement is a crucial tool for child development as it requires them to be attentive and active, propagating greater achievement due to increased enthusiasm. Nathanial raises his hand to answer a question because each student is engaged in the classroom. His enthusiasm to answer the question shows interest and a desire to learn, traits associated with high achievement. The video is helpful because it provides a glimpse of the life individuals with disabilities pass through. Many of these parents face issues with education as they would like their children to receive the best education while also avoiding the pitfalls that other children do not face. Emily, a mental health advocate, has schizophrenia and discerns that people without the illness cannot fully understand their plight (PinehurstPictures, 2010). In this aspect, people without developmental problems may not see the issues they face and should work hard to help them optimally function in society. Keith Jones also showcases an important faction of society. He claims that individuals should not expect children to develop good social skills if they stay for eight hours in a classroom without adequate interaction (PinehurstPictures, 2010). It is crucial to recognize that inclusion would work well if children were given a chance to interact frequently despite their differences.",
    "The article’s thesis statement is supported by the further reading authors investigating the case of a strange change in Professor Wilson’s lifestyle. Indeed, the reasoning behind such a decision was complex, and it includes elements of achieving maximum sustainability in the tiniest space possible. In addition, the article mentions that he shares his experiences during the nights when his ecology-focused students are invited to stay in the dumpster with him. The article caught my attention with a few details. First of all, the scenario where a respected scholar lives in the dumpster reminded me of an Ancient Greek philosopher Diogenes who lived in the barrel. Hence, it was interesting to investigate the topic and find if there are any similarities between the two. Furthermore, giving personal details and the personal background of the divorced professor added a bit of psychological interest to it. I wondered if the divorce affects men so severely that they are ready for such a downshift. But these are all subconscious thoughts and triggers. The visuals in the article were crucial to me because I felt a little tired when I started reading. Hence, being able to scroll down and see the pictures of the dumpster, pictures of day-to-day activities, and the interior of the dumpster was a way of relaxing and thinking about the subject. After looking at pictures, I had some questions; therefore, I had a personal interest in reading the article to find the answers. Honestly, the interior of the dumpster does not look that bad, and the best thing is that Wilson is able to lay there comfortably. Therefore, personally, living in a dumpster is an option for times when I feel like I need to be alone. But lack of commodities associated with the home kitchen and bathroom is why I could not choose the dumpster as a place of my permanent residence.",
    "Both lookism and extreme body modification are inherently linked to unhealthy and unrealistic beauty standards of modern society. This trait aside, however, the two are very different in its manifestations and direct consequences. Lookism is merely the act of considering someone whose appearance is not what most people would regard to be beautiful. It focuses on exhibiting negative judgement to people that do not fit the standard and is thus oriented outside of the person who engages in it. Extreme body modification is the act of changing one’s body in order to look in a way that deviates from the norms that society sets on appearance (Good, 2016). To contrast these two, one does not look pleasing in appearance, while the other intentionally marks oneself in ways that others would perceive as deviances or outside of societal standards. The differences between the two stem from their external or internal angles, despite both being related to the dissatisfaction with appearance. It is likely that a person who engages in lookism is deeply insecure about their own beauty, and thus takes a judgemental stance towards the beauty of others. Obsessiveness over other peoples’ features or grooming habits generally signals a very unhealthy relationship with self-image, despite being less visible than bodily modifications (Good, 2016). Meanwhile, said modifications can happen both by a person’s own accord, and as an act of social pressure or custom. An example of the latter would be an ancient Chinese tradition of binding female feet to make them small and rose-like in their shape. More often then not, the expectations of extreme bodily modifications are placed on women, who are expected to conform to them in certain cultures to uphold their respectability and perceived marital value.",
    "The Prince, written by Nicholas Machiavelli, is an important contribution to the modern concept of politics. In a sense, this work contradicts the philosophical tradition of ancient political thought in which political practice is overshadowed by the idealization of governments and utopian cities. On the contrary, in Prince, Machiavelli (2014) establishes that the real implementation of politics implies real situations with real people whose behavior, decisions and actions usually are not necessarily moral. The main theme of “The Prince” by Machiavelli is monarchical rule and survival. This work was regarded as a guide for politicians on the use of ruthless, self-serving cunning and inspired the term “Machiavellian”. Machiavelli (2014) discusses in detail how a ruler should act in various situations or circumstances and establishes that the main goal of politics is the successful retention of power. The book had a lasting effect on political thought since in it, Machiavelli opposed the traditional attitude to politics that serves the people to a benign self-interest, where the ruler is self-centered and focused on his goals. The book justifies any means as long as they help the governor to achieve his aims. According to Hobbes, people are egoistic, greedy, and seek personal gain. Egoism is declared to be the main incentive of human activity. But Hobbes does not condemn people for their selfish inclinations, does not believe that they are evil by nature. Many people find Hobbes’ view cynical as it is too simplified and not all actions can be explained by egoism. For example, there are a lot of people and charity organizations that donate their money and time for free without any personal gain. As for me, I find human nature infinitely more complex than power-seeking individuals described in Hobbes’s work.",
    "Levels of culture can be displayed in different planes and depths. According to Edgar Shein, who developed the concept ‘levels of organizational culture,’ and Edward Granter who later expanded on this concept, the culture of the entity can be seen in four levels: super-structural, symbolic, discursive, and cognitive (Granter, 2019). In other words, the levels of culture in enterprises are developed due to external economic and social influences, artifacts such as logos, story rituals and events, values explicitly expressed by the organization, and underlying assumptions. This paper aims to assess the levels of organizational culture for Macomb Community College. Artifacts in Macomb Community College show that it promotes concentration, attentiveness, and responsibility, which is reflected in the logo. Looking at the architecture of the buildings, some of which use chrome-plated modern high-tech structures, one can assume that technology and science are the main focus of educational programs. Nonetheless, the central older building and a park with large trees create an atmosphere of solitude and introspection, which is more in line with the study of fine arts and social sciences. Equally important, the college has a high culture of mutual help and respect and cherishes community relations, which is reflected in the developed bus route system available to students. On the value level, many signs within the college, including parking signs, library signs, and other clues, point to a love of order and organization. Probably in this college, teachers appreciate the composure and commitment shown by students. On the level of assumptions, the college probably seeks to avoid accepting students who are overly self-expressive or whose identity is tied to superficial popular culture. The college website lacks flashy headlines or programs offering to participate in the community in a frivolous way, such as selling cookies for fundraising or taking part in field trips. Thus, the levels of organizational culture at the Macomb Community College were assessed. The college has a clear identity at the level of artifacts and values. At the same time, the analysis of underlying assumptions suggests several recommendations. Perhaps, the college underestimates the importance of openness in relationships and is too harsh on manifestations of superficial identity or judgment. Given the high commitment to social and community values, Macomb Community College members should consider that openness is an important value for building good social connections.",
    "The story of King Uruk, or Gilgamesh, is widely recognized as the first known explanation of the relationship between humans and gods. In other words, The Epic of Gilgamesh is the first mention of mythology in our world. To be more exact, the piece’s primary focus is on King Uruk’s transformation from a horrible ruler to a kind one when he is forced to face mortality. As stated, the main character of this story is the King of Uruk, who now serves as a reminder that in the early times, humans used to feel the same as we did. According to Anneberg Learner (2021), this writing is older than Bible since it is “four thousand years old in its oldest form.” Therefore, The Epic of Gilgamesh describes the life of Uruk’s ruler, above all other kings, considering that he was special, “he was two-thirds divine and one-third human” (Anneberg Learner, 2021). However, when the gods realized that they could not handle such an arrogant ruler, they sent Gilgamesh’s copy, Enkidu. Finally, the King of Uruk realized the significance of social interaction, “wonderful about being engaged with another human being” (Anneberg Learner, 2021). It is significant to note that Enkidu actually started the same way as Adam and, consequently, was humanized by the prostitute sent by the gods. Still, one fatal mistake of Enkidu and Gilgamesh leads to the first’s inevitable death, and when the King of Uruk realizes that his friend is dead, he starts seeking immortality. Overall, the story’s main idea is that the gods created immortality only for themselves, while humans will always be followed by death. Eventually, as Gilgamesh’s chance to live forever was stolen by a serpent, he finally realized his treasure, knowing the past and ability to return back to his city. At the end of the story, the town survives its ruler, which is why such a powerful message leads to the human population remembering it ever since.",
    "Motivation is the process whereby an individual’s endeavors are stimulated, guided, and maintained toward achieving a goal. Thus, the responsibility of management is to monitor and direct workers in a company (Usmonovich, 2021). This is required since it is a method of inducing individuals to work, which they are capable and equipped to do freely. Even though most people have to work for a livelihood and a job is an essential part of everyone’s lives, administrators must be apprehensive about employee motivation concerns for various reasons. Managers have several valid reasons to be concerned about motivating employees. Firstly, individual success in a company is viewed as a product of talent and inspiration. Additionally, the ability is influenced by education, expertise, and learning, and its development is a difficult and laborious process, whereas motivation may be accelerated (Usmonovich, 2021). Thus, employee motivation is widely recognized as critical to a corporation’s success. In addition, a business that struggles with staff motivation is more likely to experience lower output, defective manufacturing, or other problems, and managers must guarantee that this does not happen (Usmonovich, 2021). Secondly, an administrator’s role in the company is to get tasks completed through staff. In order to sustain desired objectives, thus, leaders need to be able to notice the decreasing engagement and improve staff morale. To comprehend motivation, one must first recognize fundamental human nature, which may be both complicated and straightforward at the same time (Usmonovich, 2021). Understanding and appreciating the above is a necessity for successful employee motivation in the workplace, as well as good management and organizational achievement. Thirdly, a business is less likely to fulfill its goals if its personnel is not entirely committed. When people lose interest in their employment, organizations will see a commensurate drop in determination, invention, and productivity. The leadership that declines to confront these issues immediately endangers their job, as the firm relies on them to guarantee that employees regularly perform at a high level (Usmonovich, 2021). Thus, managers must be familiar with motivational strategies as well as comprehend their workers’ unique peculiarities and views to select incentives that will effectively motivate them to work together to achieve the organization’s goals.",
    "This tote is perfect for mothers with teenage children who are constantly on the go but want to look stylish while doing errands and during family activities. It is high-end yet durable and keeps the owner’s personal belongings organized in a portable and secure way, making it easier to get outside in the shortest time. Product Selection According to the survey data, in the target audience, the most popular brands are Channel, Pucci, and Kate Shade. Therefore, the audience is torn between products in which the quality matches the price and luxury products with unreasonable prices. In order to justify the high-end price, it might be helpful to use a high-quality leather material and equip the bag with extra pockets for organized storage, as most luxury bags miss that feature. As survey results suggest that the target audience mostly prefers shoulder bags or tote bags, providing an additional shoulder strap will offer a more substantial basis for the price. Most survey participants have three to five bags, meaning that they prefer to have one bag that will suit all occasions, including everyday use, rather than a wide variety of different bags in different styles. Combining the collected conclusions leads to the black bag option in size 9×11 made from leather with 36$ production cost. Pricing The survey results suggest that most of the target audience can afford the price from 300$ to 700$, and most prefer to shop online for handbags. Considering the target audience’s income, it is more likely that a bag with a high mid-range price will be more popular as its price can be justified, unlike luxury bag prices. The closest alternative in mid-range price from All Tote Bags On Shelves research is Ralph Lauren Carlyle Mini Leather Zip Tote Bag with a 195$ pricing. Therefore, setting the future product’s price around 250$ will result in a fair price for the customers for the products’ quality. The price will also provide additional revenue for Buhi that the company can spend on additional accessories and product packaging to create a more luxurious feel.",
    "Marx’s thesis on the fetishism of commodities focuses on society’s tendency to place value on commodities based on contributed labor, which inevitably causes domination of the products over people. Furthermore, the fetishism affects the social interactions between the customer and producer: the valued objects are independently exchanged for the respective purposes. Such exchanges of objects occur independently of human needs or decisions (Ritzer, 2011). In this case, it is essential to note that the term fetishism does not suggest any sexual connotations; it only explains people’s inclination to devote themselves to the mentioned principles. In modern society, we have fetishized technological trends in the same way that Marx’s thesis suggests. For example, Apple products are known to be highly appreciated for their “high-quality” and “accessibility”. The labor that goes into creating the products, despite sometimes being considered unethical, benefits the brand’s overall image. Since hours and hundreds of workers are dedicated to producing the items, their values increase independently of their quality. The product’s value is then highly dependent on the importance placed by the general public and marketing strategies rather than its original worth. Moreover, the workers that are required for the brand’s success also become commodities, as mentioned in the Manifesto of the Communist Party (Marx & Engels, 1818-1883). In this way, although existing independently of one another, all major parts of the modern socio-economic system become disconnected from their actual worth. Marx’s thesis fails to explore how a commodity gains its value purely from the amount of labor included in the process. This could be outlined as a critical disadvantage to the thesis, as it ignores a central perspective that aid in changing the materialistic values of society. Another detail that was not mentioned in Marx’s work is related to the nature of commodities, why some are more valued than others. Still, the Manifesto of the Communist Party and Marx’s thesis provide a solid foundation for analyzing modern socio-economic relations.",
    "Mary Breckinridge was a strong individual who, despite all her suffering and terrible losses, dedicated her life to helping people and preventing others from experiencing the disasters that she had encountered. During her lifetime, she made a tremendous impact in the development of nursing and medical research. These are the reasons why I want to write about Mary Breckinridge and her achievements. Mary Breckinridge was born February 17, 1881, in Memphis, Tennessee, but raised in many places, including Kentucky, New York, and even St. Petersburg, since her father was a congressman and U.S Minister to Russia (Breckinridge, 2021). In 1904, after her first husband died, she decided to become a nurse (Breckinridge, 2021). Mary still tried to create a family afterward, and after ten years of nursing, she retired and gave birth to a son and a daughter from her second husband (Breckinridge, 2021). However, the tragedies continued to follow Mary, and her children died soon after the birth (Breckinridge, 2021). After the disasters, she left her husband and volunteered as a nurse in World War I, finally deciding to devote her life to saving lives (Breckinridge, 2021). After the war, Mary worked mainly in Kentucky and continued her education at the Teachers College of Columbia University in New York City (Breckinridge, 2021). In 1923, she went to England to study at the British Hospital for Mothers and Babies to become a qualified midwife (Breckinridge, 2021). Also, in 1925, she established a private charitable organization, the Frontier Nursing Service (FNC), which significantly decreased both maternal and infant mortality in the area of service (Brewer, 2018). During her life, Mary significantly contributed to nursing and helped many people. Apart from the FNC that still operates in southeastern Kentucky, she was recognized as the first who introduced nurse-midwifery to the United States (Brewer, 2018). It is worth mentioning that Mary’s impact on midwifery and nursing education continued even after her death. Today, people from around the world come to the FNC School of Midwifery and Family Nursing to study her model of rural health and social service delivery (Brewer, 2018). It is hard not to admire Mary Breckinridge for her contribution to nursing, despite all the tragedies she encountered. Even after losing her kids, Mary did not let the disaster break her spirit but devoted herself to reducing suffering from other people’s lives. I truly believe that everyone can learn from her example.",
    "The introduction of new levels of nursing education is a major reform that has contributed to the complexity of the field. Traditionally, nursing schools provided degrees of a Bachelor’s level associated with the basic skills required by this profession. However, today, aspiring nurses have access to high-quality Master’s programs that further develop their competencies. In this regard, a question may reasonably arise regarding the actual value of such degrees. In fact, Master’s programs in nursing are essential for healthcare, as they align with the growing importance of nurses and the contemporary view of the system. Bachelor’s degrees provide students with the basics of the profession, its fundamental concepts and practical skills. These aspects alone form a full-fledged, competent nurse who is capable of doing their job. In other words, a Bachelor’s degree cannot be considered an “incomplete” education in nursing. At the same time, Master’s programs serve as the development impetus for those who want to engage with more sophisticated principles of 21 st -century nursing. First of all, Master’s degrees are aimed at the manner in which nurses think. More specifically, such programs promote critical thinking and cognitive agility that is required to make precise decisions in difficult situations. Thus, a certain leadership dimension is introduced, allowing nurses to enter the healthcare decision-making framework while understanding the social dimension of the issues to address (Bryant-Moore et al., 2018). Second, a Master’s in nursing supports the development of emotional intelligence, which is integral to patient-centered care. By employing critical thinking, nurses learn to analyze each case objectively and master the emotional aspect that enables strong patient connection (Cassano et al., 2020). Third, a Master’s in nursing is a major step toward proficiency in scientific research, through which nurses help to build a better system for tomorrow. Overall, Master’s programs complement the fundamental skills of each professional by a stronger presence of cognitive, emotional, and research competencies that support the emergence of nursing leaders within the professional community.",
    "Mearsheimer justifies the reasons for Modern European war by the existence and disposition of poles of power, which affect the determination of states to engage in hostilities. He considers the multipolar system the most conducive to rivalry because states’ authority is not distributed evenly (Mearsheimer, 2014). Furthermore, it is most predisposed to instability, as relations between countries change from hostile to sociable and vice versa. Such frequent transformations contribute to the constant emergence of wars. Moreover, they prevent a rational assessment of the capabilities and intentions of adversaries. An unbalanced multipolarity is the most unbalanced form because it is characterized by a hegemon pursuing as much power as feasible. Other states are fearful of such urges, and therefore their policies can be more aggressive. Mearsheimer (2014) argues that wars in modern Europe under a bipolar order occurred with minimal frequency. This system is the most steady because there is a balance between the countries, contributing to their mutual understanding. However, Mearsheimer’s concept cannot be applied nowadays because it is challenging to define the current world order. It is evident that multipolarity prevails and establishes the course of action. Still, it is closely intertwined with bipolarity, which indicates that the modern world is a unique system with dissimilar approaches and impacts. This connection distinguishes the current state of the world structure from the previous one. Therefore, one cannot associate the reasons for military conflicts solely with a specific system. Mearsheimer’s ideas regarding the grounds for wars are rational and reasonable. Nevertheless, the author doubts them because of the nuclear weapon, which existed when Europe was bipolar (Mearsheimer, 2014). It was not present in multipolar order, and therefore the arguments are not valid as the atomic weapon is one of the world’s most significant forces. Mearsheimer (2014) suggested that it, not the system, could be the foremost reason for the absence of war in bipolar Europe between 1990 and 1945. The balance of power cannot affect the outbreak of war as much as the fear of nuclear annihilation.",
    "Melanoma is generally recognized as one of the cancers that have an increasing cover percentage, though it is usually diagnosed at early stages. Recently, the ways of melanoma treatment for patients with metastatic disease were so limited that many patients were practically doomed. Fortunately, melanoma therapeutics have developed for the past decade because of the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors. Now, people with stages II and III may easily have a long period of remission. Therefore, modern options for melanoma treatment serve as a source of hope for numerous people. Indeed, innovations in the sphere of melanoma treatment are connected with the use of checkpoint inhibitors and the so-called adjuvant therapy. According to recent research, “the use of anti–CTLA-4 and anti-PD1 immune checkpoint inhibitors and combination BRAF/MEK inhibitors for patients with BRAF V600 mutations has significantly extended survival and allowed some patients to remain in durable disease remission off therapy” (Poklepovic & Luke, 2019, p. 1166). This means that the so-called “low-risk” patients with stage IIA through IIC melanoma like Mr. B. from the question may have a long remission after receiving a special course. Still, patients in remission should better keep healthy with adjuvant therapies. A decade ago, such kind of additional treatment was frequently considered of marginal effects for earlier stage melanoma because of interferon-α2b (IFN). It turned out that “the substantial associated toxicity of that interferon and other treatments, such as the anti-CTLA4 antibody ipilimumab” (Jenkins & Fisher, 2021, p. 27). Therefore, it used to be of little trust for many efficient doctors. Moreover, as far as stage II is concerned, the lower incidence of disease progression calls for unprecedented efficacy (Rozeman et al., 2018). However, with time, adjuvant therapies became recognized in the sphere of cancer treatment. The case of Mr. B may be the one where adjuvant therapy could have prevented the biopsy from coming back to stage II melanoma.",
    "Although mentoring is a relatively new term within church circles, it has been practiced widely in Christian communities for years. Across many churches, spiritual coaching, directorship, discipleship, and friendship have been implemented in a mostly unstructured form, necessitating the need to formulate standard skills and methods for mentors for better outcomes. According to Mallison (1998), Christian coaching encompasses the development of disciples and leaders through sound instructions and encouragement, which are founded on God’s will and biblical teachings. The author defines Christian mentoring as “a dynamic, intentional relationship of trust in which one person enables another to maximize the grace of God in their life and service” (Mallison, 1998, p. 8). The author’s predominant theme is that mentorship is not optional if Christians intend to grow and the criticality of taking an interest in the progress of others. Christian-based mentoring integrates various spiritual components, aspects, and the bible as the principal ingredients. By presenting Jesus as the prime mentoring model, Mallison’s (1998) central premise is that Christians should be concerned in the spiritual and personal growth of others since Christianity is relational and collectivist. The author emphasizes the concepts of community and interdependence by describing “a Christian wanting to live in isolation as a pious particle” (Mallison, 1998, p. 34). However, the author’s notable refutation is that despite integrating all the critical ingredients and observing the foundational principles, Christian mentoring is futile if not underlined by a genuine desire to see the mentor advance spiritually. Mentorship and developing an interest in the spiritual and personal growth of others are indispensable if Christians are keen on growing deeper in their spirituality. For instance, Christian fellowships should allocate responsible and dependable persons to mentor new disciples due to their reliability and genuine concern for the mentees’ progress (Mallison, 1998). One of the publication’s key implications is the critical significance of a properly structured and biblically inspired coaching program. This implies that Christian mentorship models should generate disciples and leaders who then would continue propagating the gospel. Notable critiques in the book include the exclusive dependence on the bible as the source of information for analysis. Additionally, there is limited exploration of the relationship of spiritual friends and the spiritual directors with the mentors and the absent views on mentor damage. The author also accentuates his views by drawing comparisons from other works and the extensive integration of biblical insights. A question arising from the publication is how the Christian model of mentoring can remedy destructive coaching.",
    "The study of what rhetorical tools public personalities use in their speech can be a beneficial aspect to study. With its help, people can get an understanding of how, when, and where people can use rhetorical components. This work aims to study Michelle Obama’s opening remarks at the White House Convention on Food Marketing to Children. The main message of the First Lady was to draw attention to the suppression of the advertising of unhealthy food to minors. In addition, the main appeals that Obama uses are logic and emotional. The first aspect of rhetoric used in this speech is logic. It implies the justification and reasons for a particular action or event. Michele Obama stated that “between 2008 and 2011, obesity rates among low-income preschoolers dropped in 19 states and territories across the country” (Read Michelle Obama’s Speech on Food Marketing para. 10). Therefore, Obama provides a justification of how important it is for television changes to encourage a proper lifestyle among the younger generation. The next valuable component of rhetoric in the studied speech of the first lady is the emotional aspect. Thus, Obama emphasizes that “while we have made important progress, when one in three kids is still on track to develop diabetes, and when the diet has now surpassed smoking” (Read Michelle Obama’s Speech on Food Marketing para. 11). In this case, Michele Obama points to the positive results already achieved while also highlighting that children are still at risk. In conclusion, this work was engaged in analyzing Michelle Obama’s speech on the topic of the harm of the media for introducing the younger generation to healthy habits. To better convey the main idea, the first lady used such components of rhetoric as logic and emotion. They helped to better form and give important information, gave the speech solidity, and improved the audience’s ability to persuade.",
    "Globalization has indeed become a significant pattern in the development of geopolitical and cultural practices of recent decades. With the advent of the Internet, people have become connected, even across continents: such a powerful catalyst could not fail to have a necessary consequence. In particular, people from different countries and cultures have become more integrated into a common, emerging culture in which there is room for the traditions of all peoples. Meanwhile, the representation of different cultures in this common one is unequal, which means that stronger national cultures can absorb weaker ones. A natural reaction to the unification of people was the growth of nationalistic sentiments among peoples whose cultures tend to be weaker. Thus, the spread of American sentiment (and especially the American dream) to the world often results in people from other regions becoming indifferent to their culture. In addition, globalization can lead to the destruction of the sovereignty of vulnerable communities: for example, if the big powers (the United States, China, Russia, Britain) suppress the development of small neighboring ones (Hawaii, Hong Kong, Abkhazia, or former British colonies). Healthy nationalism is not a problem because communities desire to protect themselves and preserve their cultural and political independence. However, radical, violent actions on the part of nationalists lead to international conflicts and inhibit globalization. Thus, globalization should not be evaluated regarding whether it is good or bad. Instead, it should be seen as a natural milestone in the evolution of humanity. Globalization does have advantages and disadvantages, but it is a fact in and of itself. The world now finds itself incredibly integrated, as every individual can learn news from another continent, listen to foreign music, and read non-domestic literature in a matter of minutes. This results in a new, shared culture. In this state, radical nationalism is a serious problem that society and governments must confront.",
    "There is no simple answer to what it means to be human. Some might say that being human means being independent and controlling their personal lives. For other people, being human means utilizing the refinements of civilization, wearing clothes, and going to work every day, i.e., doing everything that animals cannot do. It is also complicated to say how people want to live because everyone has unique requirements, dreams, and thoughts on this issue. This essay reflects on the On Being podcast and answers the above questions. In the podcast, Thich Nhat Hanh explains why people need to be human. According to him, “we have to remain human to be able to understand and to be compassionate” (Onbeing.org 30:53 – 30:58). The monk adds that being human means having a right to make mistakes, but the absence of a “right to continue making mistakes” (Onbeing.org 31:15 – 31:20). Therefore, being human means being mindful, responsible, and open-hearted. In other words, being human is about being humane. People live in a world of violence and terror and cannot even talk to each other effectively (Onbeing.org). Consequently, they fail to understand which way of living is genuine. From the words of Thich Nhat Hanh, it could be inferred that people want to live without anger; they want to live mindfully and be in control of their emotions. Nonetheless, an average modern person could hardly achieve this way of living. Overall, the podcast is immensely inspiring since it is dedicated to being human, problems people face in the modern mad world, and ways to avoid them. The Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh creates an impression of a conscious person whose ideas should be taken seriously. Even though I do not share the Buddhist worldview, I deeply admire the personality of Thich Nhat Hanh since he inspired me to learn more about mindfulness practices.",
    "“The Passing of Traditional Societies” is based on empirical material obtained from fieldwork and interviews conducted over a decade in Turkey, Lebanon, Syria, Egypt, Jordan, and Iran. Lerner proceeded from the fact that in the process of modernization, all societies move in the same direction, which was set by the Western countries that had completed modernization earlier. However, this “Western model,” according to Lerner, is, in fact, global. It acquired its name only due to a historical confluence of circumstances. Countries of the North Atlantic were the first to carry out the processes of secularization, urbanization, and industrialization. Analyzing the modernization of lifestyles based on empirical material, Lerner pays the most attention to the growth of population mobility, the spread of literacy, and the mass media. For example, Lerner dwelled on the problem of restrictions for modernization. Among the most critical factors hindering development, he attributed ethnocentrism. Lerner states, “From the West came the stimuli which undermined traditional society in the Middle East; for the reconstruction of a modern society that will operate efficiently” (Lerner 47). The author contrasts societies, at the same time declaring that the focus on cultural identity impedes progress. I believe that this concept of modernization designed to solve the problems of transition from “backwardness” to “modernity” was a specific product of the era after the Second World War. Built on numerous simplifications, the modernization theory interprets the historical process as one-line and non-alternative (Dunmire 23). The paradigm proposed by Lerner does not explain the development principles of many countries, such as China, Russia, or Cuba, and therefore loses its relevance in modern days.",
    "The clothing industry is amongst the many monopolistically competitive industries. There are many clothing firms in the industry competing against each other while producing similar products. However, the firms in the industry earn competitive advantages by distinguishing their products through branding and advertisements (Davis and Özgür, 4). Product differentiation is one of the strategies commonly used by monopolistic competitive firms. Product differentiation in a clothing firm can involve designs, the quality of materials used, and the prices charged for the clothes. In advertisements, differentiation is put in physical aspects such as color, designs, elastic, and different sizes (Davis and Özgür, 7). Intangible aspects included in the clothing advertisement can be guaranteed money back, high quality, free delivery, and long-lasting usage. Steel manufacturing is an example of an oligopolistic competitive industry. In such a market, a few steel manufacturing companies rule over other firms. The few firms are the price and trendsetters for other small companies and often form a partnership to operate successfully (Ritz 185). To distinguish themselves from their competitors, they improve their product quality, hike or lower prices, and advertise the special features of their products. In an oligopolistic market, if a leading company lowers prices, the others do not follow but rather improve their products to remain in the higher cuts of prices (Ritz 187). The few leading companies also stay competitive in the industry by setting their standards high to prevent easy entry into the industry. The firms set high standards by producing the highest quality products, selling them at a higher price, and producing them in high quantities (Ritz 189). That way, they ensure that the small or new companies fear the competition at the top thus ensuring reduced entry to the industry.",
    "Moral relativism claims that morality is not based on any absolute standard. According to moral relativism, ethical truth is more likely to come from situations, cultures, and sensations. The source of moral universalism is considered human nature, particularly the susceptibility of a person, the ability to empathize, and the resulting need for argumentation for persuasion. The two moral concepts are opposed, but moral universalism seems to be more truthful. Several arguments can be made concerning moral relativism that reflect a dubious nature. Firstly, while many of the arguments that insist on supporting relativism may seem compelling, they all have a logical contradiction in that they all return the correct moral schema that all people should follow, which constitutes moral universalism. Secondly, relativists may argue that different cultures have different values and that morality is relative to different people. However, these arguments explain people’s actions in terms of absolute standards, so it converges back to moral universalism. Moral universalism presupposes the existence of an ethical system that effectively regulates the behavior of members of any community, regardless of culture, race, gender, religion, nationality, sexual orientation, or any other distinguishing features. The simplest justification for this point of view is the obvious observation that in all known moral codes that have proven their viability, there is a common core: respect for life, health, property, and personal dignity. Moral universalism seems to be the more truthful theory. Firstly, moral relativism is built on exceptions, not on general rules. All people approach morality from human nature, which explains approximately the same moral and ethical codes of all countries and peoples. Moral norms are considered basic everywhere, for example, the prohibition of murder. Secondly, if everyone had their own morality and ethics, as moral relativism suggests, it would be impossible to regulate human relations.",
    "“Interpreter of Maladies” introduces the reader to a collapsing world of a dysfunctional family. In the novel, Mr. Das sparks both sympathy and a sense of slight annoyance that is likely to transform into disdain after considering the evolution of his character. Although the character might seem benevolent and sympathetic at first, his evident inability to emotionally connect with his wife or children indicates the need for further evolution, which never occurs. At first glance, Mr. Das represents a character that is easy to empathize with and relate to due to his kind nature. Indeed, Mr. Das is mostly benevolent and kind-hearted throughout the novel. For example, he is never aggressive or unkind to his wife, her mostly being the one to start a confrontation: “’But they’re harmless,’ Mr. Das said” (Lahiri). However, Mr. Das should not be seen as immediately redeemable. Specifically, on a closer look, Mr. Das’ unwillingness to interact with his wife or children becomes evident. For instance, when Mr. Kapasi starts talking to the couple., Mr. Das chooses to avoid the conversation. Namely, he chooses to read a book instead: “Mr. Das was absorbed by his tour book, so it seemed like a private conversation between Mr. Kapasi and Mrs. Das” (Lahiri). Therefore, Mr. Das clearly distances himself from his wife and, by extension, from his children, creating a further rift in their relationship. Therefore, the failure to acknowledge and address a problem represents a major obstacle in Mr. Das’ character development. as a result, he never grows throughout the novel, remaining in the same infant state of blissful ignorance. Thus, his intentionally turning a blind eye to the unhappiness of his family members makes him not as sympathetic as he might have seemed at first. Failing miserably to notice the presence of alienation between him and his wife, as well as his children, Mr. Das elicits emotions that gradually deny the reader the expected empathy and, instead, see him as desperately flawed. Even though the problems in Mr. Das’ perception of his marriage and his children are quite understandable, humanizing him and making him relatable, his inability, or unwillingness, to recognize the problem and tackle it leads to the reader’s bitter disappointment. Thus, with his complexity and contradictory nature, Mr. Das and his character arc teach the reader an important lesson about the need for introspection and acknowledging reality.",
    "The article represents an overview of other literature on methodologies and criteria used in supplier evaluation and selection process, which is believed to be one of the vital components of a successful operation of a manufacturing company. In particular, the paper emphasized the industry’s change in this field – from focusing primarily on operational efficiency to embracing the potential of strategic partnerships. The article claims that the right approach to supplier assessment, thus, is the key to a company’s development and progress. The paper starts with various ways to address the issues related to MCDM of suppliers’ selection. The most common ones are stated to be mathematical models, Simple multi-attribute rating technique (SMART), analytic network process (ANP), analytic hierarchy process (AHP), data envelopment analysis (DEA), linear programming, and some others. For example, DEA is a methodology focused on a supplier system and classifies it either as efficient or inefficient based on selecting particular criteria. Mathematical programming models usually incorporate complex evaluations between suppliers, allowing one to compare them and identify the most optimal in terms of cost and other criteria. The article further compares all methodologies by their popularity expressed in the frequency of mentions in the literature. Thus, DEA is the most common approach with 30% mentions, whereas mathematical programming (17%), AHP (15%), and case-based reasoning account for fewer mentions. However, those methodologies represent the largest share of all MCDM approaches. The article highlights the significance of knowing this distribution, which can build an idea of the most prominent ways to address the issues with suppliers’ assessment and selection. It is also stated that suppliers should be evaluated based on “the inputs of the strategic, functional and operational levels” (Agarwal et al., 2011). Methodologies such as DEA, mathematical programming, or AHP are advised to be used for identifying the most optimal suppliers, whereas AHP is noted to be effective in providing consistency.",
    "Ancient Rome could be described as multicultural, largely due to the significant areas of land that the Roman Empire controlled at various points, often integrating the local populations and cultures into their own. A wide variety of cultures existed within the borders of the Roman civilization and the Roman population was found to have incredible genetic diversity, having more in common with the Mediterranean states rather than Western Europe (Thomsen, 2019). Some of the cultures that were present under Roman rule include the Gauls, Greeks, Syrian, Egyptian, Lebanese, Persia, and many others. Scholars attribute the cultural and economic success of Rome partially to its ability to embrace a range of ethnic and national identities, often assimilating many elements of the foreign cultures into its own traditions, beliefs or practices. The well-known Pax Romana , a period of prosperity and tranquility for approximately 200 years came at a point when Roman conquests came to a relative end, and a range of cultures were given the opportunity to live in harmony under one central government. While as all Empires, Rome did push some values and requirements upon the regions it conquered, for the most part, the people could live their lives, worship their respective religions, follow their respective traditions, and even maintain their own laws and taxation (Brooks, 2019). Rome by far was one of the most multicultural states in the ancient world that greatly respected the civilizations of others. The primary culture that strongly influenced the Roman culture is likely Ancient Greece. The Hellenistic society led the basis to much what is Roman, ranging from architecture to art to philosophy and politics. The Romans greatly respected the Greeks for their progress and intelligence, and sought to build upon that foundation in the prosperity of their empire including in the aspects of science, literature, law, economics, and even military tactics. Furthermore, the Romans were influenced by the Etruscans, a neighboring tribe to the northwest of Rome, who were allied with and then conquering the newly formed city-state. Etruscans were heavy traders with the Greeks, and had a similarly loose empire of city states, sharing many of the cultural elements. Essentially, the Etruscans allowed for the Greek culture to transition into Rome (Brooks, 2019). However, Rome was influenced by the Etruscans in its early days by contributing to its military capabilities and war-oriented, expansionist society.",
    "From ancient ages, humans have used symbols and myths to express their experience of a reality that transcends the physical world and transmits it to future generations. Nowadays, famous brands apply mythology to successful products due to their magical power. The logo of the house of Versace is a very extravagant and extraordinary mark; it was designed in 1978 by Gianni Versace. The logo represents the head of the ancient Greek mythology of Medusa Gorgon. The designer explained why he chose this character; it is a synthesis of beauty and simplicity, which is able to mesmerize anyone, just like the clothes produced by the brand. Other examples are Lamborghini; first, the Italian company was engaged in the production of tractors. The bull became the emblem of the brand, as the bull is the sacred animal of Zeus. According to some people, this animal is extremely hardy and strong, which endows the brand with great power. Now, Lamborghini cars are high-performance, expensive supercars, and the emblem of the golden bull is very appropriate for them. I prefer the myth of Prometheus because evil never prevails, and goodness and justice win. The mighty titan Prometheus stole the sacred fire from Olympus to provide it for humankind. He made humanity independent of the gods. Prometheus trained people to write, count, crafts and introduced them to metals. Before, people were afraid of the elements of the sea, but now the titan taught them how to build ships; humans became proficient in the art of medicine (Travis, 2021). Prometheus was destroying people’s faith in the deity, and for this, the thunderer Zeus decided to punish him. Prometheus was chained to a rock, the sunburned him mercilessly, and the rain was pounding him. However, this was not the end of the titan’s torment; a giant eagle sat on Prometheus’s chest every day and tore his liver (Travis, 2021). Heracles, the strongest men, killed the eagle that tortured Prometheus, broke Prometheus’ chains, and the titan was free.",
    "McDonald’s filed a lawsuit in the United States against its former CEO, Steve Easterbrook, after it was revealed that he had several consensual sexual encounters with workers in the year before his leave and maintained them hidden. Easterbrook misled authorities and threw away proof of his wrongdoing; he prioritized his interests over McDonald’s. Shareholders have filed a lawsuit against the corporation for attempting to prevent misbehavior and prioritizing speed over accuracy in resolving the issue. Negligent recruitment and retention responsibility are widely used to describe an employer’s commitment not to recruit or keep a worker (Monteiro et al., 2019). The supervisor was aware of or should have been aware of the likelihood of engaging in behavior against other persons or otherwise subjecting workers or third parties to legal responsibility. Companies can be held accountable for their workers’ intentional misbehavior (dos Santos et al., 2017). This work is written to study the case of negligence at work since negligence is the most common type of tort. If a McDonald’s fails to vet a worker before hiring them thoroughly and they cause harm to others, the corporation may be held accountable for their conduct. A McDonald’s, for instance, should examine all prior work, certification qualifications, and current professional associations before hiring an executive chef (Rushchenko et al., 2020). If the chef commits frequent culinary errors that cause health concerns for diners, the popular fast food restaurant is likely to be held accountable since it failed to do a basic employment background check. This is one of the reasons why criminal history checks are required. If a person strikes colleagues and consumers and can demonstrate that a criminal history check revealed past violent conduct, the business may be held liable. Assume an employer knows an employee’s risky, unpredictable, or disrespectful behavior but does not fire the worker. In that instance, McDonald’s might be held accountable for ensuring the safety of others.",
    "When it comes to people I find most fascinating and interesting, Neil deGrasse Tyson is one of them. This man is a famous astrophysicist and planetary scientist who shares his opinions and knowledge on various platforms. Personally, I find the pieces of information he provides mind-opening and shocking at times. I believe that this person knows a lot of controversial information and has various opinions on such matters, which would be pretty interesting to know. Neil deGrasse Tyson was born in 1958 and received several degrees from various universities, including Harvard, the University of Texas at Austin, and Columbia University (Tyson). Additionally, in early 2000, he was appointed by the president to serve on the Commission on the Future of the United States Aerospace Industry (Culp). I am a person who has always been fond of the vast and mysterious cosmos. I have watched a lot of documentaries that shed light on the peculiarities of universes, galaxies, and planets. Among those documentaries was Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey, narrated by Neil deGrasse Tyson. I believe that the knowledge of this astrophysicist stretches far beyond the information narrated in the documentary. If I had a chance to talk to this person, I would definitely ask him questions about extraterrestrial life. I have always found it perplexing that our planet is the only planet that has life, and I wonder if Tyson has any theories on this matter. I would also like to ask him whether he knows about any classified information at NASA. Hence, Neil deGrasse Tyson is one of the fascinating people to me. His knowledge and experience inspire me, and I would love to have a chance to talk to him in real life. From this experience, I would like to gain new perceptions and theories on the cosmos and information about outer space, something not commonly discussed. I think this person has more information and opinions to share.",
    "It is important to note that brain tissue is among the most complex and intricate structures of the human body, which has a highly limited capacity for healing and regeneration. The topic of the proposed research is to assess how neural stem cells replace and differentiate into neurons and other cells of the brain in order to use them for therapeutic purposes. N eural stems cells must be used as a therapeutic measure to slow or halt the aging process due to their rejuvenation and differentiation capabilities. Organization Plan  1. Introduction.  2. Literature Review.  3. Brain Aging.  4. Neural Stem Cell Differentiation.  5. Differentiation Regulation.  6. Therapeutic Approaches.  7. Discussion.  8. Conclusion. Literature Review Part 1 The preliminary research suggests that there is a complex system of regulatory steps that involve GABA signaling. There is an array of signaling molecules involved in the ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ) neurogenesis, such as Sonic hedgehog, fibroblast growth factor 2, glutamate, and others. The subgranular zone (SGZ) is another important germinal region of the adult human brain, and the mechanisms of regulations are comparatively different between V-SVZ and SGZ. Part 2 For example, a key source of the proposal states that “V-SVZ NSCs are regulated by local signals from their immediate neighbors, as well as by neurotransmitters and factors that are secreted by distant neurons, the choroid plexus, and vasculature” (Obernier & Alvarez-Buylla, 2019, p. 1). In other words, distantly located cells secrete a wide range of signaling molecules to regulate the neural stem cell generation, differentiation, and regeneration processes.

    "The two American regions to be first settled by the English colonists were New England and the Chesapeake Bay. In the Chesapeake Bay, the colonists arrived under the auspices of Virginia Company – a joint-stock enterprise dedicated to colonizing America for profit. Although the early hopes of finding precious metals did not materialize, the region eventually found its economic specialization in growing tobacco (Corbett et al., 2022). The company hired the English poor for the labor-intensive task of growing the colony and producing tobacco, and most of the newcomers were young single males (Corbett et al., 2022). Conversely, the New England colonies followed a different settlement pattern. Unlike the Chesapeake Bay, they were shaped not by the pursuit of profit but by the desire to escape persecution and perceived moral decadence of England and create a virtuous society (Corbett et al., 2022). New Englanders came to America as entire families and, unlike the Chesapeake Bay colonists, established a largely self-sustaining economy of farms, hamlets, and commercial enterprises rather than cash crop plantations (Corbett et al., 2022). Such were the differences in settlement patterns and shaping forces between the two. Religion played a considerable role in both regions, although in the shape of different denominations. The founders of New England colonies established their settlements with an explicitly religious purpose of creating a perfect Protestant community, which was the case in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and other colonies as well (Corbett et al., 2022). Interestingly enough, although the Chesapeake Bay colonies were business enterprises intended primarily for profit, the Anglican Church also played a considerable role in their life. For them, proselytism was a means to establish better relations with the Native Americans, as in John Rolf’s famous marriage to Pocahontas (Tsukada, 2020). Thus, both Protestant and Anglican denominations played their role in the colonization of New England and the Chesapeake Bay, respectively.",
    "A new creation that has recently entered the market is the electric scooter. It quickly gained popularity because it allowed people to rush from one part of the city to another. At the same time, people spent less time because they were not stuck in traffic lights (Hagiu and Wright 1527). Its competitive advantage, though, is that it does not harm the natural environment and requires less energy for maintenance. That is, such scooters use little energy resources to operate and therefore are better than a car (Hagiu and Wright 1527). It should be noted that some electric scooters can be charged by the sun accordingly; it can be described as an uncomplicated device for a low price, which enables to move quickly. Thus, the above advantages contribute to the fact that people are increasingly choosing electric scooters; consequently, they have gained popularity in the market in a short time. A product that will expand gradually in the market is wireless headphones. It is becoming popular because every phone manufacturer is trying to produce such an accessory. At the same time, the competitive advantage is that they are small and comfortable to use (Hagiu and Wright 1527). Although their price is higher than ordinary headphones, they work longer and do not break as quickly. They have gained a stronger position in the market because of the fact that they directly attach to phones at a distance, which is convenient in today’s world. Moreover, people who buy the phone also choose headphones from their company (Hagiu and Wright 1527). Thus, the benefits listed above contribute to the number of types of wireless headphones on the market and their popularity.",
    "With the current broad variety of species, as well as the emergent news about the species that are on the verge of extinction due to the impact of the changes in the environment, one might believe that discovering new animals is no longer a possibility. However, new species are still discovered regularly, the recent incredible find being an example of that. Namely, the Nimba myotis, also known as the fuzzy orange bat, or Myotis nimbaensis, has been identified as a new species this year (Simmons et al., 2021). Having orange fur with black pigmentation, Nimba Myotis represents a rather unusual specimen of bats. The animal prefers natural caves as the place where it lives and rests. Like other bats, Nimba Myotis uses laryngeal echolocation as the means of identifying and catching prey in the dark. However, due to the species in question being under researched, its diet is mostly unknown (Simmons et al., 2021). Overall, the bat represents a unique specimen in its class. The species belongs to the animal kingdom, particularly, to mammals of the Chiroptera order and the Vespertilionidae family (Simmons et al., 2021). The main rationale for placing it in the animal kingdom is the fact that Nimba Myotis is a mammal. Additionally, the specified species reproduces sexually, unlike members of other kingdoms, and is multicellular (Simmons et al., 2021). Furthermore, the fact that cells in Nimba Myotis do not have cell walls, allows classifying it with other species in the Animal kingdom. Therefore, the bat should be defined as an animal, particularly, a mammal. Furthermore, one should note that, being a bat, Nimba Myotis represents the largest order in the mammal class after rodents (Simmons et al., 2021). Overall, the discovery of Nimba Myotis has shed a lot of light on the species of bats, in general.",
    "There are many different species of marine microbes that exist in the water in massive amounts. Among the Nitrite oxidizing bacteria, there are six main types: Nitrotoga, Nitrospira, Nitrolancetus, Nitrospina, Nitrobacter, and Nitrococcus (Han 2). One of the fascinating species of bacteria is Nitrobacter which plays a crucial role in the nutrition of plants. Since this is a nitrifying bacterium, it serves as a simple way to release nitrogen that comes out of plants. Therefore, this paper aims to analyze the essence of the Nitrobacter, its specific characteristics its position in the ecosystem. Nitrobacter is the most interesting among the other species because it participates in converting nitrite to nitrates. Nitrification happens due to the receiving of nitrates from ammonia by oxidation, and the process goes with the help of the pair of bacteria, which are Nitrobacter and Nitrosomonas (Han 3). First of all, it is crucial to mention the concept of nitrification and the operations that are included there in order. Since the process is happening in the soil, it is a remarkable biological phenomenon that may also influence the other factors connected with nature. The nitrogen cycle is a significant part of the biological processes, and bacteria that exist in the soil take part in the majority of chemical phases that produce atmospheric nitrogen into the new condition. Overall, Nitrobacter is an integral part of maintaining the diversity of the microorganism in the soil that is provided by its oxidation activity. It plays a critical role in the plants’ nutrition and, as a nitrifying bacterium, makes it possible for the soil to preserve the auspicious condition and maintain its fertility. Thus, due to those reasons, Nitrobacter is an exceptionally fascinating species of Nitrite oxidizing bacteria.",
    "Millions of people worldwide suffer from mental disorders: manias, phobias, and panic attacks exhaust and torment a lot of individuals. One of the widespread, long-lasting mental ailments is an obsessive-compulsive disorder or OCD, which consists of obsessive thoughts and compulsive behavior that are almost impossible to control. The analysis of this disorder due to the four D diagnostic indicators can let us explore it more profoundly and thoroughly.   * Distress: OCD often makes individuals feel abnormal when they are forced to fight the terrible thoughts torturing their heads and repeat meaningless acts intended to decrease anxiety. In addition, having “unwanted, recurrent and persistent images or impulses that evoke anxiety or extreme distress” and realizing “the unreasonable nature of symptoms” people cannot stop them (Van Leeuwen et al., 2020, p. 1-2). They become nervous and depressed: therefore, the level of distress is high and complicates the person’s life.   * Dysfunction: This disorder significantly influences the daily life of a patient. Firstly, obsessive thoughts often interfere with the usual people’s acts and cause a surge of panic, disturbing to complete their work. Sometimes, “cognitive biases cause dysfunctional beliefs” (Van Leeuwen et al., 2020, p. 2). Secondly, compulsive actions interrupt a patient’s daily routine, forcing them to do specific steps a certain number of times. Such activities can last even for an hour or more: therefore, the extent of dysfunction is also noticeable.   * Danger: OCD may represent a significant danger for an individual since sometimes, people feel so depressed that they are ready to commit suicide. In addition, sometimes, they may try to defeat their obsessive thoughts, causing self-pain: for instance, they can strike themselves to get rid of the unwanted image. However, although one of the most widespread fears of people with OCD is to harm others, they rarely do it (O’Connor & Aude, 2019). Thus, the level of danger to self is significantly higher than that of danger to others.   * Deviance: Since OCD causes abnormal thoughts and behavior, people with such a disorder can be characterized as deviant. However, it would be wrong to claim that it is easy to “determine the degree of deviation from the norm” (Davis, 2009, p. 1). OCD causes anxiety, stress, and panic; it makes people live in fear that if they do not do specific actions, they will not be able to avoid danger. Therefore, an individual should visit a clinic and let specialists help them fight.",

    "In the survey The Effect Of Work Relationships On Organizational Culture And Commitment, as many as 89% of respondents confirmed that communication with colleagues affects the quality of life (Suhardi, 2020). It also turned out that if a person has at least one friend at work, it connects him more strongly with the company and supports his desire to stay in this place. Feeling connected to other people supports employees’ interest and involvement in work. Talking to colleagues, a person gradually gets rid of the fear of expressing their ideas and comments. Scientists from the University of Michigan conducted an interesting experiment, Friends (and Sometimes Enemies) With Cognitive Benefits: What Types of Social Interactions Boost Executive Functioning? The participants were divided into two groups: first, the first group subjects had to get to know each other for 10 minutes. And the second group was asked to participate in disputes among themselves on a certain topic. Then all the subjects were asked to solve several cognitive tasks. The experiment participants from the first group, who had previously just communicated in a relaxed atmosphere, showed the best results in solving problems. They had significant improvements in the executive functions of the brain. These processes are responsible for planning, concentration, prioritization, and organization. In other words, for the skills and qualities that we need to work.",
    "Osteoarthritis is a disease that affects people all over the world, but is frequently mishandled within the healthcare system. It is one of the most common causes of disability in older persons, resulting in pain, loss of function, and a lower quality of life. On a societal level, the condition is predicted to cost $303 billion in medical bills and lost wages each year (Abramoff & Caldera, 2020). This chronic, severe disease requires continued efforts to limit its incidence, pain, and loss of function. Osteoarthritis is known for its degenerative effects on articular cartilage, which becomes significantly damaged over time. The smooth cartilage at the ends of long bones and within the intervertebral discs is known as articular cartilage. It provides a low-friction articulation surface while being able to transmit large loads. Even while the collagen in cartilage has a lengthy half-life, it repairs slowly, if at all, even with slight injuries. Although the cartilage transforms the most, the entire joint, including the synovium, joint ligaments, and subchondral bone, is impacted. Osteoarthritis is often overlooked, despite its significant personal, economic, and societal costs. Even though osteoarthritis frequently coexists with heart disease, diabetes, and mental health issues, and can aggravate the morbidity and mortality associated with these ailments, it is not included in worldwide strategic plans for noncommunicable diseases. Patients and practitioners may be affected by therapeutic nihilism, with misconceptions that osteoarthritis is an unavoidable component of aging and that there are no viable therapies (Abramoff & Caldera, 2020). The affected people are frequently misinformed about treatment options. Current health-care approaches can range from ignoring essential treatments like exercise, weight loss, and education to using expensive, unproven medications for late-stage disease. I find this issue to be the most interesting, although unfortunate, element of both the article and the condition’s perception. I believe that rehabilitation counselling could combine physical and psychological aid to help patients with osteoarthritis and its various consequences.",
    "Outreach Chicago is an organization providing help and services to homeless people and those underserved by already existing incorporations. The company’s main mission is to provide help and necessities to humans for their subsequent successful reintegration into society. To practice deductive reasoning, it is essential to start by formulating a general hypothesis or statement that Outreach Chicago provides help to people (Adler & Clark, 2015). The observation allows us to find evidence for the statement as Outreach Chicago serves meals and distributes hygiene kits, coats, blankets, socks, and undergarments to people in need. The company’s official site provides precise numbers of each aid type, so one can conclude that the company indeed provides help with various necessities since 2011 to people in need. Outreach Chicago states the average poverty rate in its area of performance is 34% among adults and 51% among children (Outreach Chicago, 2022). To practice inductive reasoning, it might be useful to compare data stated by the company with the other statistical sources regarding poverty rates, checking the modernity of the information it proposes to the readers. The company works in several locations: Chicago Heights, Chicago, Cicero, Dolton, and Harvey (Outreach Chicago, 2022). The estimations, according to the site Welfare Info, relate to the following poverty rates among adults in 2017 26.4%, 20.6%, 19.8%, 26.6%, and 35.6% respectively (Poverty Illinois, 2022). The calculated average of these areas is 25.8% which means the company was either gathering data from previous years or referring to the numbers of the poorest city, Harvey. A question for qualitative research can be if the services provided by Outreach Chicago meet the requirements of the customers. This research can interview customers and assess the impression of service, and the use of the goods it supplies. The study hypothesizes that Outreach Chicago provides essential supplies for its clients. The results of the research could be used for better service providing as customers can give feedback on some items that are not necessary or could be changed. For the quantitative study, the question is if the general satisfaction level of the clients is above 50%. To estimate satisfaction, the clients will be given application forms to fill in. The research hypothesizes that Outreach Chicago meets the expectations of the customers by more than 50%. The research can help the organization receive information about the effectiveness of its performance.",
    "Overpopulation in cities has become one of the most critical problems of our time. This is both an environmental and a social problem. The city cannot grow indefinitely and provide decent workplaces for every resident. The ecological burden is also increasing. Uncontrolled growth in the number of cities leads to the unchecked spread of pollution and the escalation of poverty. However, there are several preventive measures that the Government can implement to combat this problem. First of all, overpopulation in cities is congestion and traffic jams, which lead to serious pollution problems. Atmospheric pollution is the most serious in cities, and its primary source is road transport, which emits sulfur dioxide and nitrogen into the air in huge quantities. The second main problem is poverty: disadvantaged groups in rural areas live in poverty (Innes et al., 2019). Some of them decide to settle in the city because they believe that they can easily find work. Their main goal is to provide for their family, but almost none have the necessary education for a good job. These people come to the city and become a service class. They suffer from the prejudice of indigenous people, poverty, and worse working conditions. Another inconvenience due to overcrowding is the garbage from residents, which is difficult to dispose of (Namberger et al., 2019). In many European countries, this problem is solved thanks to separate garbage collection (even in houses, there are separate garbage cans). Then some of the garbage is recycled, some are incinerated at incinerators. In conclusion, to solve traffic and air pollution problems, people should use public transport as often as possible, rather than using their car. The government should build more roads and improve public transport to solve this problem. Poverty is now lower than at any time in human history, and all trends demonstrate that we will have consistent successes in the fight against poverty in the foreseeable future.",
    "The Balboa is Panama’s national currency, named after Spanish explorer Vasco Nez de Balboa, who encountered the Pacific Ocean. One Balboa represents one U.S. Dollar, and the U.S. Dollar has been lawfully exchanged in Panama since then. As a result, Panama is regarded a highly inflationary country; however, Panama can profit from the U.S. dollar’s resilience as the foundation of the world banking markets. For example, this implies that Panama will not face hyperinflation as a consequence of shifting exchange rates. Consequently, Panama has become a more attractive investment and tourist destination. Nevertheless, a dollarized system has outstanding inflation performances and may even lessen the influence of global trust shocks but not real external upsets (Bakari & Mabrouki, 2017). Furthermore, it is unclear whether Panama’s loose monetary policy resulted from the dollarization system or the competing, increasingly globalized banking sector. Panama’s geographic position as a key maritime route adds to the significance of the Agreement. Approximately two-thirds of the Panama Canal’s yearly transits are destined to or from U.S. locations (Park et al., 2020). Almost all U.S. automotive and commercial goods shipments to Panama will be duty-free initially, with residual levies phased away over a ten-year period (Park et al., 2020). Information systems gear, farming, large machinery, aircraft and components, healthcare and measure environmental, ecological products, medicines, fertilizer, and agrochemicals are among the U.S. items that will benefit from immediate duty-free accessibility. The U.S. and Panama exchange crops like corn and bananas if we talk about exports and imports."

Ukraine’s forces have shown incredible grit and tenacity in the face of this aggression, but the conflict is escalating into an even more brutal chapter. Europe is on the brink of experiencing its most significant military invasion in years.\n\nCountless people are now displaced, and many Ukrainian citizens have sought refuge in neighboring countries, yearning for peace. The haunting sounds of gunfire and artillery blasts reverberate through residential areas of Ukraine, as media outlets around the globe work tirelessly to relay the unfolding drama to the world. Different newspapers paint varied pictures of the crisis, with distinctions evident in their headlines, videos, and images.\n\nTwo major players in the reportage of these events are The New York Times and the French newspaper Le Monde. Although both cover the same harrowing events, their portrayals are strikingly different. When Russian forces overtook Kharkiv, The New York Times boomed with the headline, “Russian Troops Take Over Kharkiv.” Meanwhile, Le Monde conveyed a graver tone with “La Russie A Envahi Kharkiv,” meaning “Russia Has Invaded Kharkiv.”\n\nA recent video circulated of Ukrainian citizens fervently crafting Molotov cocktails. The New York Times dubbed it, “Ukraine Prepares Molotov Cocktails In Kyiv,” while Le Monde framed it as “Ukrainian Resistance Using Molotov Bombs.” Headlines like these are more than just words; they’re crafted to grab attention and shape narrative perspectives.\n\nThe New York Times tends to dramatize, hinting at a new world war on the horizon, whereas Le Monde often softens the implications of Russia’s actions. These contrasting headlines are all part of a broader strategy to captivate their respective audiences with unique and compelling stories.",
    "Charles Schwab is a for-profit corporation primarily focused on savings and loans. The company offers banking services, asset management, and financial advisory through several subsidiaries, including Charles Schwab & Co., Inc., Charles Schwab Investment Management, Inc., TD Ameritrade, Inc., and TD Ameritrade Clearing, Inc.\n\nThis paper aims to analyze the business structure of Charles Schwab Corporation (CSC). As a corporation, CSC has some distinctive features. For one, the officers act as agents, while the directors and shareholders aren't involved in day-to-day management or strategic decisions.\n\nThe company is managed by a board of directors who have the authority to appoint officers. This setup creates a balance of power because CEOs and CFOs are deeply involved in the operations and can be voted out by the board in extreme situations. Shareholders have the freedom to transfer ownership, enabling the corporation to be sold if necessary, such as in the event of bankruptcy. This is unlike an LLC, where such flexibility isn't inherent.\n\nAlso, corporate income is taxed twice: first at the corporate level and again when dividends are distributed to shareholders.\n\nIn summary, Charles Schwab Corporation operates as a classic corporation, complete with multiple subsidiaries. Its board of directors plays an indirect role in daily management but holds significant power in critical situations. Furthermore, the ability to transfer ownership and the double taxation of income are hallmarks of its corporate structure.",
    "Being a clinical or medical office worker involves a mix of administrative tasks and medical activities. These professionals mostly handle paperwork and interact with staff (\"How to become a medical office assistant,\" 2021). So, I'm planning to attend job interviews in a professional business style. Though a good suit can be pricey, I already own one. I will wear my black suit, shoes, and minimal accessories to make a great impression without spending extra money. In warm weather, I can wear the suit as is, and in cold weather, I'll add my overcoat.\n\nFor work clothes, I might need to buy a few things. Healthcare workers, including office assistants, usually wear scrubs, which are a shirt and trousers combo. They're not too expensive; you can get a set on Amazon for around $20-$40 (\"Medical assistant’s uniform,\" 2019). Shoes are another important consideration since the job can involve a lot of standing and walking. A good pair of closed-toe shoes might cost about $100, but I already have tennis shoes that fit the dress code (\"Medical assistant’s uniform,\" 2019). Sometimes, medical institutions provide uniforms, so I might not need to buy them at all.\n\nAfter looking into it, I realized this really won’t impact my budget much. If the hospital provides uniforms, I won't need to spend any money. Even if I do have to buy my own, I’ll still stay within my budget. So, I can set aside $200 just in case and be ready for what interviewers might ask. Overall, I’ve found that clothes for interviews and work won’t be an issue for me; I'm already well-prepared.",
    "Carl Jung describes the mother complex as an innate feeling of care in the emotional bond between a mother and child. If this attachment is missing, an archetype emerges where the mother fails to meet essential needs, causing the child to seek comfort elsewhere (Bobroff 35). This mother complex involves both a nurturing and a devouring archetype, leading to security or possessiveness and deprivation (Bobroff 36).\n\nIn \"Every Secret Thing,\" Alice's complex relationship with her mother is central to the kidnappings. Hellen's preference for Ronnie over Alice makes Alice insecure and leads to her involvement in the kidnapping case. Alice becomes a primary suspect, especially as she previously had a biracial child and gave it up for adoption while in prison (Berg). Hellen orchestrates both kidnappings and the initial murder, planting evidence to implicate Alice and ensure her imprisonment (Berg). The film reveals that Alice and Ronnie were wrongfully imprisoned, with the justice system failing to identify Hellen as the true culprit.",
    "The article discusses a Chicago hot dog restaurant incident involving a man who was asked to wear a mask. In response, the man threw snow at the employee and broke the glass door with an unknown object (Sutton, 2022). These actions are disproportionate to the situation, causing harm and property damage, and are ethically wrong.\n\nFrom a utilitarian perspective, the offender's actions are harmful due to the broken door and distress caused to the employee, thus deemed wrong by the consequences. In contrast, Kantian moral theory views the actions as irrational and immoral, as they violate moral law and duty.\n\nI find utilitarianism more logical for resolving this ethical issue, as it focuses on the negative consequences of actions as a moral guide. Kantian moral theory relies on subjective moral laws, which might not consider this incident an ethical issue. Utilitarianism, however, clearly identifies the actions as wrong due to their negative impact.",
    "The main source for this study is the renowned medical journal, The Lancet. It shares the survey data and provides detailed statistics and comparative analysis of the collected information. The Economist serves as a secondary source, summarizing the research with a bit less focus on digital content. \n\nThis study highlights an important finding: it shows a decrease in HIV infection rates among schoolgirls when their families receive financial support. The study, funded by the World Bank and led by Berk Özler, aimed to show the effectiveness of financial aid in reducing the spread of HIV among young, impoverished girls.\n\nConducted in the Zomba district of Malawi, the study involved 1,300 unmarried girls aged 13 to 22. By using a computer to randomly assign the girls to different groups, the researchers ensured that some girls and their families received small monthly payments, some girls received financial support for school attendance, and others received no financial assistance.\n\nThe results were clear: the girls who received financial assistance, either directly or through school support, showed a notable decrease in HIV infection rates. Unfortunately, the girls who did not receive any financial help were more likely to seek out a \"sugar daddy,\" which led to higher rates of HIV infection in this group. This demonstrates the powerful impact that financial aid can have in reducing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.\n\nThese findings suggest that global financial support is crucial in the fight against HIV. However, some challenges remain. It's difficult to determine the precise amount of money needed to prevent girls from seeking risky relationships, and the study only covered an 18-month period, so the long-term effects remain uncertain.\n\nIn conclusion, financial aid has proven to be a valuable tool in reducing HIV rates among young girls, but further research and long-term support are essential to continue making progress in this area.",
    "Horror films have solidified their place as one of the cornerstone genres in cinema, rivaling the popularity of other styles. What sets them apart is the intense emotional response they elicit from their audience. For many, these films serve as a form of psychological release, providing a distraction from personal issues. Contrary to being a modern-day spectacle of violence, horror films offer a safe venue for experiencing fear—a basic human instinct linked to self-preservation. While it might seem odd that people would pay to feel fear, Stephen King, in his essay \"Why We Crave Horror Movies,\" explains that people use these films to reaffirm their sense of normalcy. This means temporarily resetting their usual emotions, whether for distraction, an adrenaline rush, or to safely express repressed feelings.\n\nGood art provokes emotion, and horror films are no exception. While they might not seem connected to ethical pleasure, their success is heavily reliant on audience reaction. The strong, often visceral reactions that horror films provoke are what make them stand out and confer their artistic value. It's rare for someone to remain indifferent to a visceral scare, which is why horror movies are wildly successful today. In summary, horror films are far from modern public lynching. They provide a unique pathway to strong emotional release for various personal reasons, from psychological relief to escapism. The reaction they evoke from the audience is crucial, making them a distinct and impactful form of art.",
    "A mutation represents an alteration in an organism's genetic material. Typically, mutations are characterized by modifications in DNA that arise from disruptions in gene sequences or the formation of new genes. In this discussion, I aim to delve into spontaneous mutations. These occur randomly – for instance, a sheep might suddenly be born with shorter legs among a flock of standard sheep; humans can experience such mutations as well. Take the ADRB1 gene, which influences the sleep requirements for optimal human functioning. While most people need at least eight hours of sleep, roughly 5% have a unique mutated version of this gene. Research on a mother and daughter duo with this mutation showed they could function on just 4 to 6 hours of sleep each night (Servick, 2019). This particular mutation falls under the category of genomic mutations. The protein it encodes acts as a receptor for norepinephrine, a neurotransmitter. Remarkably, this mutation is dominant and autosomal, enhancing the viability of individuals who possess it. Although primarily detected in humans, it could also occur in animals, though no research has yet explored this possibility. This mutation has a minimal impact on the wider human population because it isn't hazardous or life-threatening. Instead, it presents a beneficial trait for those who carry it, bolstering their life abilities rather than diminishing them. Despite being dominant, this mutation occurs sporadically and doesn't represent a common trend in population-wide genetic changes. The example captivates me because it illustrates how natural variations in our genome can unlock new potentials for humanity. Therefore, studying these changes is crucial for human advancement and a comprehensive understanding of our capabilities.",
    "In his graphic novel \"Maus,\" Art Spiegelman employs anthropomorphism to distinguish between different races, such as Americans, Germans, and Jews. This literary device simplifies complex issues, allowing readers to focus more on the conveyed ideas. Spiegelman illustrates the horrors of the Holocaust while reminding readers that its victims and survivors had their own lives and dreams.\n\nThe first section to consider is Chapter 1, \"The Sheik.\" Here, the protagonist Artie asks his father Vladek to share his wartime experiences. Instead of detailing the Holocaust's horrors, Vladek recounts his happy, carefree life in 1935. This choice reflects the tendency of war victims to remember the pleasant times (Spiegelman, 1980, pp. 13-23).\n\nChapter 3, \"Prisoner of War,\" is the second section examined. In this chapter, Vladek discusses his initial experiences as a soldier, specifically recalling the name of an enemy soldier he killed. This detail emphasizes how, even during terrifying events, the mind fixates on seemingly minor details (Spiegelman, 1980, p. 50). Vladek's reunion with his family is noted as more significant than his prisoner-of-war experiences.\n\nThe third section, Chapter 5, \"Mouse Holes,\" highlights the difficult decisions that the characters, depicted as mice, must make to survive. Even upon discovering their children's deaths, parents must remain composed to avoid detection by the 'cats' (Spiegelman, 1980).\n\nIn conclusion, \"Maus\" is a distinctive literary work about World War II. Through his graphic illustrations, Spiegelman captures the Holocaust's horrors and the small yet significant things that gave victims hope. Despite the violence and murders, Spiegelman portrays the Germans as mere animals mistakenly believing they are superior to others.",
    "Developing a web-based system to store the university’s student information and transcripts presents various risks that must be addressed in the feasibility report. By employing a standard risk evaluation process, these risks can be categorized into two main groups: project continuation and completion risks, and end product performance risks.\n\n### Project Continuation and Completion Risks:\n\n1. **Unforeseen Delays and Time Expenditures:** Implementation might be more complex than anticipated, requiring additional time.\n2. **Health Issues Among Project Members:** Illnesses could slow down production.\n3. **Hardware and Software Failures:** Available technology might malfunction.\n\n### End Product Performance Risks:\n\n1. **Insufficient Security:** The product may not be secure enough to handle personal student data.\n2. **Economic Unfeasibility:** Running the product could be too costly.\n3. **Inadequate Performance:** The product may not meet the university’s requirements.\n\n### Risk Management Strategies:\n\n- **Time-Related Issues:** Identify potential delays by comparing progress against the pre-established timeline.\n- **Functionality and Requirements Risks:** Match the product to its requirements and conduct thorough testing at specific milestones.\n- **Personnel and Hardware Issues:** Allocate additional time beyond the initial estimate to accommodate potential replacements or repairs.\n- **Security and Performance Concerns:** While addressing performance risks can be challenging, ensure comprehensive testing to uncover and fix issues early on. Reactionary measures may be necessary for handling unforeseen problems post-launch.\n\nBy proactively managing these risks, you can enhance the chances of a successful project completion and a robust end product.",
    "Here's the text rewritten to sound more natural and conversational:\n\n---\n\nLet's break down the key ratios: Return on Assets (RoA), Return on Equity (RoE), and Profit Margin. These indicators are critical for gauging how well a modern business is performing.\n\nFirst up, Return on Assets (RoA) tells us how efficiently a company is using all its resources—including borrowed ones—to generate financial returns. Return on Equity (RoE) is similar, but it focuses only on the shareholders' equity and ignores the debt (Gallo, 2016). Lastly, the Profit Margin is crucial for understanding financial health. It directly compares sales to profits, showing us how much the company actually earns from its operations.\n\n### ABC Company: A Closer Look\n\nFirst off, ABC Company seems to have a solid business model, generating decent profits. The strong RoA and RoE suggest that investors can expect good returns. The profit margin looks favorable too, indicating effective management of this area.\n\n### Profitability at ABC Company\n\nOverall, ABC Company is profitable and efficiently converts its assets into revenue. A profit margin of over 50% is impressive, especially considering the overall turnover is under $1 million. This indicates the business model works well, keeping ABC Company stable in the market. However, this might not be enough for long-term growth.\n\n### Financial Success in Context\n\nWhile ABC Company’s financials look positive, it’s important to see how it stacks up against industry leaders. Comparisons help highlight strengths and pinpoint areas needing improvement. Rose (2022) notes that the industry average RoA was between 9.1-9.3% over the past four years. ABC's current RoA is much higher at 28.3%, but it’s worth noting their absolute cash flow isn't on par with industry leaders. As ABC grows, its ratios may align more closely with industry averages.\n\nTake net income, for instance. The industry average in 2020 was $4.7 million, while ABC's net income is just $77,000. This shows ABC still has significant growth ahead. Additionally, industry giants like Williams-Sonoma have hundreds of millions in sales, whereas ABC is at half-a-million. As ABC’s total assets grow, maintaining high profit margins and returns on investment could be challenging. The focus will need to be on keeping operations profitable above the industry average.\n\n---\n\nThis version maintains the essential information but presents it in a more conversational tone.",
    "Both the \"Iliad\" and \"Metamorphosis\" explore the theme of power abuse by depicting the lives of gods, their relationships, and their interactions with humans. In the \"Iliad,\" Agamemnon faces consequences for his constant misuse of power: \"be ready, that I be not left,/Alone of all the Greeks, without my prize\" (Homer, 762 B.C.). Similarly, in \"Metamorphosis,\" various gods show a blatant disregard for those with lesser power: \"What had escaped the waves, now feared the flame\" (Ovid, 8 B.C.). However, unlike the \"Iliad,\" \"Metamorphosis\" seldom shows deities facing repercussions for neglecting mortal needs (Homer, 762 B.C.; Ovid, 8 B.C.). Thus, while both works address the issue of power abuse, they offer slightly different perspectives. The theme of protecting mortals, central to both the \"Iliad\" and \"Metamorphosis,\" remains relevant today. Many contemporary leaders wield immense power, whether through political influence, economic clout, or both (Homer, 762 B.C.; Ovid, 8 B.C.). For example, ignoring human rights in countries like China, where leaders attain almost god-like status, mirrors the scenarios in the \"Iliad\" and \"Metamorphosis.\" However, \"Metamorphosis\" is less impactful due to its comedic portrayal of mortals' suffering. Contrastingly, the \"Iliad,\" being more serious, more effectively condemns the violence of omnipotent gods towards humans, aligning better with the modern concept of power abuse. Nonetheless, both the \"Iliad\" and \"Metamorphosis\" deliver significant messages. They provide insight into the power dynamics of Ancient Greek society and highlight similar patterns in today's world.",
    "The study by Zulaika (2022) explores the repercussions of COVID-19 lockdowns on teenage pregnancies and school dropouts among secondary school girls in Kenya. After the nationwide school closures from March 2020 to January 2021, there was a notable rise in cases of teenage pregnancy in Kenya. Zulaika (2022) investigates the pandemic’s effect on the sexual and reproductive health of adolescents in Rarieda subcounty, finding minimal involvement from health administrators regarding pregnancies among school girls. The research highlights a significant lack of sexual education among teenagers, who remain unaware of various protection methods. Emphasizing the importance of this issue, the study points out that early pregnancies can be hazardous to girls’ health and lead to multiple socio-economic challenges in the future. An ongoing rise in adolescent pregnancy could result in a decline in the education levels of females in Kenya. \n\nZulaika (2022) also notes that pregnant teenagers experience high stress levels, impacting both their mental and physical health. To address this problem, the study advises the introduction of population-level emergency measures targeting school-going girls. It calls for the implementation of sexual education programs to inform students about the basics and potential side effects of sexual activity. Furthermore, the article stresses the rapid spread of infectious diseases among schoolgirls due to a lack of knowledge about the importance of contraceptives. This underscores the necessity for a national initiative to educate school students and their parents on sexual and reproductive health issues. The repercussions of COVID-19 on teenage pregnancies are predominantly negative, generating additional social and economic burdens not just for the pregnant girls and their families, but also for the wider Kenyan society.",
    "First and foremost, it's important to note that I have chosen France for this assignment. There are many French consulates in the United States, but to transport remains to France, one must contact the special consulate general located in Los Angeles, California. A mourner should arrange a meeting with a specialist at this office two days in advance to discuss all the necessary details for dispatching human remains and sealing an urn (\"Shipment of cremated remains,\" 2019). Thus, the Consulate General of France in Los Angeles is a crucial point of contact for assistance in transporting remains.\n\nFor this process, specific documents need to be provided to the family. These include a death certificate from the US, a medical report, and certificates of cremation and sealing. Additionally, an attestation confirming the absence of foreign objects and the sealed status of the urn, a certificate stating the deceased did not have infectious diseases, and a permit to import remains must be obtained. A permission request for repatriation and a certified French translation of the death and cremation certificates are also required.\n\nThe family will also need an urn containing the ashes in a special airtight container. The requirements for transporting the urn to France are not overly complicated. One must apply directly to the French consulate in the US and prepare the mentioned documents. Several airlines, such as Air France-KLM, specialize in the transportation of ashes. Usually, transport arrangements are made based on agreements between funeral companies in the US and France. I have been communicating with Julie Duhaut-Bedos from the consulate for this matter. The consulate will also assist with flight booking, and depending on the distance, a direct flight or one with transfers may be necessary. Each airline has specific conditions for transporting special cargo. The urn with the ashes will be securely sealed and placed in a special lockable box with thick walls. Transportation by plane is only possible in the luggage compartment.",
    "Amazon has become one of the most important companies in the US, known for its efficient deliveries and low prices. It is also a major employer, with many fulfillment centers across the country. However, with its large scale, various issues have arisen. Recently, complaints about worker treatment have gained public attention, highlighting the need to understand Amazon's working conditions better. \n\nKey Problems: \n- Job Dissatisfaction \n- High Turnover Rates \n\nAlthough Amazon guarantees $15 an hour, this short-term incentive isn't enough to sustain long-term worker satisfaction. Gradual pay increases would be more appealing and beneficial. Research suggests that competition in the labor market—moving to another firm—affects worker motivation (Bar-Isaac & Levy, 2022). Amazon could reduce its turnover rate by adopting a more traditional approach to motivating workers.\n\nCause: \n- Poor Motivation Techniques \n\nE-commerce has grown, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic, but Amazon faces competition from new companies expanding their market shares. To cut costs, Amazon places fulfillment centers in economically struggling areas. High turnover remains a significant issue that needs addressing (Kinicki, 2020).\n\nDesired Solution: \n- Utilize More Conservative Motivation Frameworks \n\nAmazon's current policies—emphasizing fear and discouraging camaraderie—hurt employee motivation and the company's image. Implementing systematic pay raises, enhancing bonus systems, and changing how employees are timed can help motivate workers in a more positive and respectful way.",
    "American slavery initially emerged as a capitalist exploitation of labor, but it eventually developed into a distinct socio-economic and political framework. Over time, a liberation movement surfaced, challenging the legality and morality of owning people. Yet, post-emancipation, former slaves found themselves reliant on the state and previous slave owners, lacking essential resources for survival. With no documentation, financial means, or moral backing, integrating into mainstream society proved arduous. Discrimination and exclusion persisted. The abolition of slavery, culminating through the Civil War between the northern and southern states, was solidified with the Thirteenth Amendment to the US Constitution in January 1865, permanently outlawing slavery. Today, this period is regarded as a profoundly shameful chapter in American history. This raises an important question: should the state have compensated former slaves for the immense material and emotional harm they endured? While slavery is no longer legally sanctioned and slaves have been freed, their survival was precarious without basic life resources. Societal attitudes also played a crucial role in accepting new members; unequal opportunities complicated their integration. Thus, despite their formal freedom, these new citizens remained dependent on external resources for their subsistence, revealing that true emancipation had not yet been fully achieved.",
    "Let's take a look at a user-friendly version of the Bosch dishwasher manual. One great thing about this manual is that it’s packed with pictures, making it super easy to see exactly how to use your dishwasher. For example, it shows you how to add rinse aid, load your dishes, and even take out the baskets.\n\nThe manual is designed for people who might be new to using a dishwasher. It has a simple installation section because they expect a professional will set it up for you. Most of the manual is in bullet points, so you can quickly find what you need without wading through lots of text. \n\nIt’s really helpful because it covers practical questions you might have, like choosing the right program for different types of dishes and messes, how to stop or cancel a program, and how to check if everything is working correctly. Even though it’s written in plain language without complicated terms, it still feels thorough and professional.\n\nThe manual gives clear instructions on using the dishwasher, maintaining it, installing it, disposing of wastes, and what to do if something goes wrong. The design focus really shows with many illustrations, diagrams, and bullet points, which make it easy to follow. Warnings are marked with a noticeable red triangle and exclamation point, so you won't miss important safety tips.\n\nThe layout is logical too. It starts with the basics of the dishwasher’s parts, then moves on to loading the tableware, adding water softener, salt, and rinse aid, and finally, how to care for the machine and troubleshoot problems.",
    "The nature of competition encompasses various factors, including the number and size of companies, their strengths and weaknesses, barriers to market entry and exit, and the threat of substitutes. Today’s competitive landscape is markedly different from the traditional environment, which relied heavily on large advertising budgets and economies of scale. It is continuously evolving due to rapid technological advancements. \n\nIn this dynamic environment, contemporary competitive strategies are characterized by innovation, integration, flexibility, and speed. Companies now depend on data-driven decision-making to gain competitive advantages, create transparent business processes, adapt to the latest market technologies, and enhance the consumer experience. To remain competitive, most companies focus on customer-oriented operations to meet demand and bolster brand awareness and loyalty.\n\nKey drivers of today's competitive landscape include new business models, consumer protection, price transparency, hypercompetition, and environmental awareness. However, the primary drivers are flexibility and technology. Companies cannot rely on a single strategy for stable growth and development; they must leverage all technological advantages to outperform competitors. Those that are flexible, adopt diverse approaches, and seize opportunities are more likely to succeed, even in challenging economic conditions.\n\nFor example, NVIDIA, a multinational technology company that designs graphics processing units and chips for various markets, has thrived despite the COVID-19 recession. The company capitalized on the global lockdown and increased demand for remote computing services and video gaming. In the third quarter of 2020, approximately seven million Nintendo gaming consoles with NVIDIA chips were sold (Fitch, 2020). This case illustrates that companies capable of quickly adapting to changing conditions can remain productive and in high demand in the current competitive landscape.",
    "Guaman Poma saw firsthand the wrongdoings of the colonial government and even suffered due to their actions. Coming from a lineage of Incan noblemen, he grew up in a world changed by Spanish conquest. His family lost their lands and titles, and his efforts to get them back were constantly blocked by the colonial authorities (Kilroy-Ewbank, n.d.). Initially, Poma tried to work with the colonials, but after being exiled over supposedly fake claims of nobility, he turned against the Spanish and started speaking out about their mistreatment of the native people.\n\nPoma put together a massive 1200-page illustrated document addressed to the Spanish king. In it, he detailed the Andean life before the invasion and the suffering that followed under the Conquistadors. This manuscript lays bare the full horrors of colonialism, arguing that the Spanish were outsiders with no right to the land that rightfully belonged to Peruvians. Poma proposed a new system of political organization where the government truly represented and catered to its people (Kilroy-Ewbank, n.d.).\n\nPoma contributed significantly to the debates on liberty, political representation, social responsibility, and the self-determination of states. His idea that governments should be created for and by the people who have historically lived on the land is surprisingly modern. He also debunked the myth that Europeans brought civilization and political organization to the Incas, showing this claim to be a hypocritical excuse for violence, economic gain, and cultural destruction. He illustrated how an entire way of life was obliterated, with people stripped of their freedom and forced to assimilate. Despite admiring the moral standards the Spanish claimed to uphold, Poma made it clear that they fell short of those ideals.",
    "Background The effect of prayer is rooted in the patterns and nuances of cognitive processes, specifically involving the abilities to switch and concentrate attention. During prayer, individuals shift and focus on a realm of higher spirituality. The practice of consistent and systematic prayer leads to repeated focus on religious themes, thereby strengthening the mental connection with God. Froese and Jones (2021) state that prayer reinforces one’s belief in the supernatural, making it an exercise of faith. Moreover, public prayer has historically been a tool for political influence (Froese & Jones, 2021). Consequently, prayer can be viewed as a sacred and supernatural weapon. Martin echoes this concept, noting that religion has historical instances where turning to God influenced military outcomes (Martin, 2019). For example, in A.D. 174, prayer helped a Roman legion discover a spring, and the resulting flood washed away their enemies (Martin, 2019). Both authors highlight that prayer acts as a weapon, bringing individuals closer to God. Participants often feel socially accepted and emotionally uplifted after prayer. Repeated and rhythmic prayers reinforce the ideals and principles of a given religion (Froese & Jones, 2021). Martin further concludes that these elements make prayer a strategy for epiphany. Proactivity in prayer is seen as a response to a vision for one's destiny, enabling individuals to shape their future through prayer (Froese & Jones, 2021). Historically, many sought God’s protection in battles through prayer, which helped alleviate fear and strengthen the resolve of the Israelites long before Jesus's time (Martin, 2019). Such prayers reassured soldiers before conflicts, promising them a place in heaven if victorious (Martin, 2019). Both authors agree that such proactive prayer requests have been a constant in Christian history, with no significant differences in their viewpoints.\n\nSummary Repentance In his second letter to the Corinthians, Paul describes repentance as godly sorrow leading to salvation (2 Corinthians 7:10). For Paul, repentance means not returning to sin. It purifies the soul, allowing it to more fully receive the grace of the Holy Spirit. Dedication",
    "Supporters of relativism argue that objective morality does not exist; societal moral norms are not obligatory. Concepts of good and evil are seen as fictional. Researcher Porus noted that moral relativism can easily lead to permissiveness (Bush and Moss, 2020). People who embrace relativism may be seen as devaluing moral norms, unwilling to compromise or negotiate. In contrast, objectivism asserts that absolute right and wrong exist independently of opinions or factors. Moral standards are considered eternal and human-independent, with various philosophical interpretations centering on a single truth, opposing relativism (Bush and Moss, 2020). Objectivism allows for some change in moral norms but maintains a core understanding of good and bad. \n\nI find relativism more convincing despite its flaws. While absolute relativity can indicate a lack of a moral core and can be unreliable, it reflects reality more accurately. Daily decisions often lack a clear right or wrong answer. People generally strive to act ethically, but their actions can still be perceived negatively. It is impossible to please everyone due to differing ideas of good and evil, influenced by individual experience, psychology, and circumstances. Objectivism, to me, is overly simplistic and utopian, threatening to distort the complexity of morality.",
    "Cryptocurrencies are a controversial topic in society due to their volatility, which raises questions about their long-term validity. Despite the promise of older blockchain coins, they have failed to deliver a scalable, secure, and highly decentralized currency (Hamilton, 2022). Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, Solana offers several advantages that make it a worthwhile investment. This proposal aims to highlight the benefits of Solana for a business university graduate.\n\nSolana may not be the newest cryptocurrency, but it has significant potential. Many blockchains have a limited capacity for transactions, making them inefficient due to their low operations per second (Locke, 2021). In contrast, Solana enables faster transactions with minimal fees (Farrington, 2021). Investing in Solana presents a safer option among cryptocurrencies, with the potential to significantly increase one's savings. The speed and security of Solana's transactions suggest a high likelihood of future widespread adoption (Hamilton, 2022).\n\nI propose capitalizing on Solana’s recent market success, as its value surged by 12000% in the past year (Locke, 2021). This topic warrants more attention, as cryptocurrencies offer a unique perspective on financial interactions but currently lack efficiency for widespread corporate use. Solana has the potential to overcome these barriers and become a globally accepted currency.\n\nIn conclusion, Solana is a cryptocurrency worth noting for its numerous advantages, making it a more favorable investment compared to other similar coins. Its strong market position and robust community support indicate promising future prospects. Additionally, it might be prudent to analyze Solana’s carbon footprint to fully assess its potential for long-term success.",
    "Yoga encompasses a blend of spiritual, mental, and physical exercises designed to harmonize the body's cognitive and physiological processes. By engaging in this practice, individuals can expand their perspectives, revamp their lifestyles, and eliminate detrimental habits that hinder progress. This is why yoga is heralded as a premier practice for self-improvement, offering unparalleled health advantages for both the body and mind. There are many styles of contemporary yoga, and although they may vary, they all share common elements: physical postures, breath control, and meditative reflection. This synergy of body and soul exercises uniquely benefits health by strengthening muscles, increasing flexibility, and boosting mental clarity. In addition, yoga classes have immense therapeutic and preventive value. Research involving patients with musculoskeletal issues has demonstrated that yoga alleviates pain and enhances joint mobility (Saeed et al., 2019). Breathing exercises help relax the muscles around the airways and improve oxygen intake, leading to better lung function. \n\nA cornerstone of yoga philosophy is the “eight limbs,” a series of stages aimed at reaching enlightenment. These steps are essential for cultivating a sense of connection with the world. Through these practices, one gains mastery over their actions, faces challenges with equanimity, and discovers ways to compromise. The ultimate goal is to strike a balance between personal and universal values, realizing that everyone has a vital role in the community. This approach markedly enhances social well-being by aligning body, mind, and soul (Saeed et al., 2019). This equilibrium fosters a healthy, harmonious personality, unleashes energy potential, and mitigates psychological stress.\n\nIn summary, yoga is vital for advancing health and averting social isolation and depression. It serves as a powerful tool for physical growth, recovery, and emotional rejuvenation. Rooted in a holistic approach, yoga effectively restores the body's natural state, making it an invaluable practice for self-improvement and well-being for both adults and children.",
    "Theodor Adorno’s concept of industrial culture posits a strong link between capitalist society and its cultural products, which serve to reinforce social practices that promote the ongoing development of capitalism. According to Adorno, media products such as films, books, and television programs perpetuate capitalist values among the populace. In contrast, structural functionalism views society as a living organism, where each part plays a role in maintaining the viability of the whole. Although both theories emphasize the importance of social stability, their differences become more evident when applied to modern culture and society. \n\nAdorno highlighted the pervasive narrative in mass media, where wealth is often equated with happiness. A more explicit example of reinforcing capitalist values can be found in children's entertainment. From an early age, modern children are exposed to various media forms such as TV shows, cartoons, and animated films. Structural functionalism interprets the children’s entertainment industry as a source of education and emotional development, teaching important moral values such as kindness and politeness, which serve as the bedrock for future societal security. However, from the perspective of industrial culture, modern children's entertainment focuses on merchandising associated with film characters. For instance, Disney—a highly influential company—pioneered the business model of using cartoon characters to attract children to their theme parks (Clement, 2018). The company now strategically coordinates the simultaneous release of animated films and related merchandise to maximize financial gain.",
    "Archetypes are universal patterns that define various events, objects, and people. In literature, they represent common concepts that resonate with all individuals, allowing them to understand and interpret stories more effectively. However, archetypes are not confined to the realm of fiction; they also significantly influence our daily lives and shape our perceptions of the world.\n\nParticularly, archetypes of people help determine their character, actions, and motivations. When applied to everyday life, we can identify specific types of individuals who possess unique yet commonly shared traits. These traits are shaped by both personal inclinations and environmental factors.\n\nTake, for example, the archetype of a modern corporate leader like Elon Musk. He can be viewed as a hero or creator—someone with the inspiration and audacity to change the world. This perception shapes how others see him, embodying the essence of an archetype. His actions are driven by these defining characteristics, with his primary motivation being world transformation.\n\nRecognizing archetypes in daily life allows for a more nuanced understanding of people and events. By identifying these traits, one can discern a person's motivations and role, making their actions more predictable. While people often exhibit a mix of traits, complicating the application of archetypes, the concept still provides valuable insight into human behavior. This understanding can help in forming more meaningful relationships and interactions with others.",
    "Introduction  \nShifts in societal attitudes towards romantic relationships and marriage reflect broader trends in societal development. Gen Z's unique perspectives offer valuable insights for analyzing these shifts (Klein, 2022). Individuals’ mindsets are shaped by external circumstances, which link opinions on love and sex to personal well-being. To fully understand these phenomena, it’s crucial to consider both the human factor and environmental conditions. \"Are Gen Z more pragmatic about love and sex?\" delves into this topic, providing a basis for analyzing effective writing on complex issues.\n\nSummary of the Article  \nJessica Klein’s article highlights Gen Z’s trend of postponing marriage and avoiding long-term relationships to focus on personal goals. Unlike previous generations, Gen Z does not see marriage as a rite of passage into adulthood. First, they find the advantages of single life more appealing, offering opportunities for introspection (Klein, 2022). Second, the pragmatic approach they adopt underscores the necessity of attaining life stability before considering family (Klein, 2022). Third, confronted by challenges like the pandemic, Gen Zers carefully deliberate their choice of partners, slowing down relationship processes and emphasizing self-focus over interpersonal engagements (Klein, 2022). These shifts highlight significant changes in the nature of human relationships.\n\nResponse Evidence  \nKlein’s article excels through the use of robust evidence from diverse sources, both qualitative and quantitative. By referencing multiple studies, surveys among Gen Z, and statistical data from official institutions, Klein (2022) provides a comprehensive analysis. Her comparison of current trends with past generational experiences enhances credibility and reliability, creating a solid foundation for further research. Additionally, incorporating personal opinions alongside scholarly studies enriches the article’s depth (Klein, 2022). This strategic use of evidence and analysis defines the strengths of Klein’s work.\n\nExternal and Internal Factors",
    "This study, conducted from 2016 to 2018, provides a comprehensive analysis of sport fisheries in both the Anchorage Management Area and the North Gulf Coast Management Area. It includes detailed descriptions and historical backgrounds of each fishery, management practices, and data on performance and escapement up to 2018. The report highlights how reductions in the number and size of fish available for release in locally stocked lakes have negatively impacted the popularity and productivity of local fisheries. The source is deemed reliable due to its provision of statistical data, which is crucial for any related research.\n\nIn addition to these areas, the study examines the complex factors influencing diversity in Alaskan fisheries—a critical fishing region worldwide. By analyzing participation trends and portfolio variance over three decades through harvest statistics and literature reviews, the research provides insights into how fishers, fleets, and communities have responded to biological declines, market and pricing changes, and fisheries privatization. These findings are verified by experts, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the information. This comprehensive analysis not only reflects current trends but also identifies key factors affecting the scope and dynamics of sport fishing, making it invaluable for further research.",
    "Deductive reasoning focuses on establishing strong cause-and-effect links. Typically, this involves either connecting two facts or linking an idea to its potential future impact (Besnard & Hunter, 2018). A logical judgment consists of two parts: the premises and the conclusion. An argument in logic is deemed valid if it is structured in such a way that if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. Interestingly, for a deductive argument to be valid, the premises don't necessarily have to be true—they just need to logically ensure the conclusion if they were accurate. \n\nFor example:\n1. All metals are heavy.\n2. Tin is a metal.\n3. Therefore, Tin is heavy.\n\nA sound argument, on the other hand, must have both a valid structure and true premises. Validity alone doesn't guarantee soundness, as invalid assumptions can still produce a logically consistent argument.\n\nFor instance:\n1. All dogs are cats.\n2. All mice are dogs.\n3. Therefore, all mice are cats.\n\nThough this argument is valid in form, the premises are incorrect, making the argument unsound. The logical necessity of the conclusion depends purely on the premises, regardless of their truth. The ultimate goal of argumentation is to verify the truth of a judgment, which an invalid argument fails to accomplish and thus cannot be considered sound (Besnard & Hunter, 2018). Therefore, a sound argument must have both a solid logical structure and true premises; if the argument is invalid, the premises lose their relevance, and the conclusion alone stands unsupported. In such cases, we don't have a genuine argument, much less a sound one.",
    "Aristotle made a fundamental discovery in logic by introducing variables. This showed that logic is not just a specific doctrine about particular things or terms but the science of the laws of syllogisms, such as modus ponens and modus tollens, expressed in variables. By examining different judgments, formal logic abstracts from their specific content to reveal a structure common to objects with different contents. Aristotle's invention of the syllogism is the central and most original part of his logic. In his theory of syllogisms, Aristotle defined what a syllogism is, differentiated their types, identified valid and invalid types, and established three figures of syllogism. \n\nI find it particularly fascinating that Aristotle was the first to make the methods of reasoning a subject of scientific inquiry. He introduced these methods as integrated formations rather than just isolated components. Before Aristotle, logic only attempted to understand individual methods and principles without systematizing them into a coherent system. Concepts such as modus ponens and modus tollens thus laid the groundwork for defining the truth in thinking. I'm impressed by how precisely Aristotle introduced the concepts of conclusions that align with scientific rules of inference, the laws of contradiction, and the excluded middle.\n\nModern logic, as an independent field of knowledge, emerged from different sciences like philosophy and mathematics. Although it is a highly advanced concept, modern logic lacks some characteristic philosophical features—it is more straightforward and technical. Often referred to as mathematical logic, modern logic emphasizes its new methods compared to those used previously. Thus, it is of less interest for philosophical discussion because it relies on exact sciences and computer technology, avoiding ambiguity. Consequently, modern logic is built on artificial language and intelligence, which, in my view, is rather mundane compared to traditional concepts.",
    "Leveraging groundbreaking technologies, ADNOC plans to integrate its electronic advancements across all areas of activity and production as early as next year. A prime example of the broad and versatile use of artificial intelligence is the predictive capacity of computer systems. The company is creating a computer capable of processing vast amounts of data and suggesting strategic actions based on forecasts. The developers of ADNOC's software aim to build a machine that operates on a specific theory while facilitating efficient data interpretation. Consequently, within the company, a robust program has been developed for not only processing information but also visualizing it. By utilizing more accessible visual media to communicate complex data, this development enhances the company's present and future clarity.\n\nThe use of computer technologies in growing a large company is evident at all levels of its operations. ADNOC employs computer simulations to refine network processes and visualize data for a clearer understanding of the company's position. These advancements are incorporated into every aspect of the company's operations, boosting performance speed and action effectiveness for greater benefits. Their initiative to digitalize and modernize various areas of the company's activities is set to be fully implemented in 2022 (ADNOC, 2020). This underscores the company's dedication to foresighting and adapting to future trends. ADNOC strives to develop a forecasting model that encompasses the maximum amount of statistical data possible. The outcomes of big data processing reveal that ADNOC has significantly increased the speed and volume of financial transactions through its software.

The diverse financial growth opportunities enabled by this program are potentially vast.",
    "The adversarial criminal justice system ensures equal application of the law to all and presumes innocence, placing the burden of proof on the prosecution. The defendant benefits from doubt, has the right to silence, legal representation, and protection from unauthorized searches and arrests. These rights, however, disadvantage the prosecution and can encourage deceptive legal tactics. Ethical issues arise due to these procedural safeguards favoring the accused. Additionally, racial biases affect outcomes: black men face higher arrest and conviction rates and longer sentences than white individuals for similar crimes, reflecting systemic racism and inequality.",
    "Learning about religions and philosophies can profoundly enrich our understanding. The origins and backgrounds of these belief systems are crucial for accurate interpretation. Take Jainism, for instance—it's an ancient tradition, significantly older than the more contemporary Sikhism. While both religions have strong connections to Hinduism, Sikhism only emerged around 500 years ago, whereas Jainism boasts a history of nearly 2500 years (Molloy 191). Sikhism tends toward a more militant form of monotheism despite its relatively recent origins. This contrasts sharply with Jainism's unique rejection of a Creator deity, attributing the universe to natural forces instead. This divergence from traditional deity-centric theology is particularly fascinating.\n\nAdditionally, observing how religions interact with the world through their distinct perspectives adds another layer of intrigue. Jainism's denial of a God aligns with several philosophical questions also considered in atheistic thought. For example, it questions the paradoxes often found in monotheistic beliefs, such as the coexistence of a perfect God with an imperfect world or a loving God allowing suffering. Jainism even challenges the logic of a Creator needing to be created, a concept that seems strikingly modern and potentially controversial for its era.\n\nEthics is another integral aspect of any belief system, and Jainism espouses five key ethical principles: Ahimsa (non-violence), Satya (truth), Astheya (non-stealing), Brahmacharya (chastity), and Aparigraha (non-possession). Ahimsa, or non-violence, particularly resonates with me. In my view, many religions justify violence under certain circumstances, which conflicts with my moral values. Jainism, however, prioritizes non-violence and deems it inexcusable, presenting a compelling ethical stance that aligns with my beliefs.",
    "It is important to understand that one culture often cannot grasp the internal struggles and complexities of another. This concept, known as ethnocentrism, involves viewing the world through the lens of one's own culture. For example, the book notes: “people in America don’t understand, but when an American chain opens in a third-world country, people go crazy” (Noah 188). As a Canadian, I see that many people from developing nations might not realize that a fast-food chain opening is not particularly exciting for us. The book also mentions that “Westerners are shocked and confused by that, but it’s a case of the West reaping what it has sown. The colonial powers carved Africa, put the black man to work, and did not properly educate him” (Noah 194). \n\nSimilarly, many believe Canadians are excessively polite due to cultural stereotypes, but that’s not always true. One compelling aspect of the book is how certain tyrants are not viewed the same way globally due to their limited relevance in different regions. For example, the text states: “so in Europe and America, yes, Hitler is the Greatest Madman in History, In Africa, he’s just another strongman from history books” (Noah 196). Although Canada hasn't had such tyrants, people outside Canada sometimes mistakenly believe our leaders are flawless champions of democracy. However, they also face power struggles and do not always act in the nation's best interests, which recent events have made increasingly evident.",
    "Globalization involves the exchange of information, investments, trade, political collaboration, cultural values, and social ideas across nations. It is facilitating a seamless global environment where managers can operate beyond local boundaries. This enables them to manage international operations, recruit employees globally, source raw materials from top suppliers, and market products in diverse regions (Samson et al., 2020). While this borderless realm offers numerous opportunities, it also poses challenges such as information security and cultural disparities. Developing a global mindset, whereby managers can understand and influence people from various cultural, social, political, and psychological backgrounds, has become crucial (Samson et al., 2020). It's vital for managers in international firms to grasp these diverse perspectives to ensure smooth operations and effective collaboration. The global business landscape is evolving with the rise of economies like China, India, and Brazil. For instance, China has attracted substantial foreign investments, growing its number of Fortune Global 500 companies from 16 in 2005 to 98 in 2015 (Samson et al., 2020). China excels in manufacturing, while India thrives in services, software development, and precision engineering. A multinational corporation (MNC) earns over 25% of its revenues from international operations (Samson et al., 2020). MNCs maintain close coordination among their international branches under a unified management structure making key decisions (Samson et al., 2020). Managers in these corporations adopt a global outlook, treating the entire world as a single market. Outsourcing involves leveraging global labor divisions to carry out activities in regions with the most cost-effective resources and labor (Samson et al., 2020). Exporting is a strategy where a company's production remains domestic, but goods are sold internationally. Licensing allows a company to grant foreign firms access to its technology or trademarks to produce and sell products abroad (Samson et al., 2020). Direct investing means the company controls its production facilities in another country.",
    "This study examined how a helpful message on the back of the dining check about upcoming specials influenced the amount of tip left for the waiter. The researchers measured tipping by calculating the percentage of the bill left as a tip. They considered possible confounding factors such as food quality, the server’s gender, the size of the dining party, and whether the customers were regulars. \n\nThe study's strengths include its clear design, simple implementation, and the possibility of replicating it in different settings. However, the message content varied based on the specials, appealing differently to customers. Also, the study was conducted in a single restaurant, making it hard to apply the results to other types of establishments. These factors could affect tipping outcomes and the study results. \n\nIt’s unclear whether the personalized message itself or its content influenced tipping. To test this, servers could have written different messages, some with no useful content—like wishing a good day or drawing a smiley face. Additionally, servers rather than dining parties could have been assigned randomly. \n\nThe researchers instructed servers to behave consistently, reducing potential confounders. Varying server attitudes might affect tipping and weaken the causal relationship. A few aspects might limit the study’s broader applicability. For example, if the study involved a young female server, applying the findings to male or older servers would be difficult due to the potential gender factor. If conducted in a private country club, the results might not apply well to high-class or casual restaurants. Buffet-style meals might lead to lower tips, affecting generalizability.\n\nThe study included only two groups, servers and dining parties, with no size specification. Including solo diners could have helped address group size effects and the impact of individual interactions, as well as gender effects on tipping.",

Their work is published in Current Psychology, indicating it meets specific quality standards, and was accessed through the Jerry Falwell Library.",
    "Different cultures have unique creation myths and artistic representations. Aztec cosmology differs significantly from the European Christian worldview. The Christian God created humans in His image and granted them dominion over the Garden of Eden, portraying Him as a fatherly, forgiving figure. Christian art emphasizes His forgiveness and nature's bounty. In contrast, Aztec creation stories involve dismembered gods, symbolizing catastrophic violence. Aztec art, which depicts gruesome and awe-inspiring deities, serves as a warning to obey divine demands for blood sacrifices. Their central figure, a female goddess, is a passive player punished by other gods, similar to Eve's disobedience. While both traditions describe gods as perfect and self-contained, Christianity views evil as Satan's domain, whereas Aztec deities transcend good and evil. Thus, Aztecs performed sacrifices for survival, while Christians reject sin for eternal salvation. Christian creation emphasizes forgiveness and love, whereas Aztec myths focus on survival through violence, reflected in their respective art styles.",
    "The concept of nursing is intrinsically linked to continuous improvement, requiring health care to adapt to evolving social trends to ensure the best possible care. One effective way to achieve this standard is by integrating the latest scholarly findings into clinical practices. This process, known as evidence-based practice (EBP) (Wilson & Austria, 2021), involves applying research-based insights in daily patient care. However, EBP is not yet widely adopted by nurses, largely due to several challenges. \n\nFirst, the demanding workload of most nurses hampers their willingness to engage with EBP. McArthur et al. (2021) highlight that \"physical opportunity\" factors, such as cost, lack of resources, poor communication, staff turnover, and limited physical guidelines, impede nurses’ ability to implement EBP (p. 20). Consequently, management often promotes reactive rather than proactive behavioral patterns in response to the environment.\n\nAnother significant barrier to EBP is the lack of \"social opportunity,\" which includes insufficient organizational support and teamwork (McArthur et al., 2021). These barriers illustrate only a fraction of the existing challenges, underscoring the urgent need for interventions to facilitate EBP.\n\nTo promote EBP, establishing leadership that exemplifies and encourages the practice is crucial. Leaders should conduct training and workshops to bolster EBP adoption. Additionally, ensuring that nurses have access to relevant resources, such as databases, a stable internet connection, and subscriptions to peer-reviewed publications, can make the use of scholarly research more time-efficient and less stressful. By addressing these issues, the integration of EBP into nursing practice can be significantly enhanced.",
    "Beowulf is undoubtedly one of the most significant ancient European poems. Despite ongoing debates about its origin, the commonly accepted view is that it is \"a Danish poem in the Anglo-Saxon dialect\" (Neidorf 847). The poem narrates the heroic life of Beowulf, who is revered as a divine protector (Gummere line 13). He aids Hrothgar, the king of the Danes, by defeating the monster Grendel and later Grendel's mother. Eventually ascending to kingship himself, Beowulf faces a dragon that threatens his realm. Although he defeats the beast, he succumbs to his mortal injuries.\n\nFrom a personal perspective, the poem addresses several fundamental aspects of human life. The first is the theme of identity: in Beowulf, individuals are deeply connected to the glory of their ancestors, existing within the framework of their lineage and kinship bonds. This compels Beowulf to seek fame and recognition. Additionally, the poem explores maturity and responsibility, illustrating how Beowulf's quest for personal glory evolves into the realization of his duties as a wise ruler. Lastly, the poem delves into the tension between personal values and the heroic code, as well as the interplay between Christian and pagan beliefs. This reflects the complexity and multifaceted nature of human existence, contrasting with rigid rules that often fall short of providing adequate answers.",
    "Beowulf, an Anglo-Saxon epic poem set in Jutland prior to the Angles' migration to Britain, centers on its titular hero, Beowulf (Hall 2). Beowulf emerged as a celebrated figure in Old English literature, influencing popular culture significantly. This epic hero's acceptance of his fate without hesitation draws attention in today's world, which is often filled with doubts and contradictions. His archetypal clarity and wholeness resonate strongly in modern times. For instance, the popularity of superhero comics today partly stems from the enduring need for an image of a fair, superpowered being. A prime example is Superman, one of the most beloved heroes of the Marvel Universe, who shares clear similarities with Beowulf. Both possess incredible strength and serve as role models for their respective eras (Burn 107). They face tremendous obstacles to support those in need, and their remarkable physical abilities earn them admiration and reverence. A common thread in their stories is the presence of formidable enemies whose defeat is crucial for the world's survival. \n\nHowever, modern audiences require more than just physical strength to admire a hero; they also seek purity of thought and noble intentions. As society becomes more complex, the hero's persona evolves to reflect these changes. Despite this evolution, people continue to draw inspiration from ancient tales, aligning with postmodernist theory, which emphasizes the continual reinterpretation and experimentation with past narratives. Consequently, stories about legendary superheroes remain relevant to contemporary viewers, readers, and audiences. Just as in Saxon times, bravery and loyalty are celebrated, and individuals possessing these traits are regarded as exemplary role models.",
    "Successful implementation of the P-O-L-C framework depends on several key factors, particularly in times of crisis or market challenges. The collapse of WorldCom in 2002, which resulted in a major accounting scandal, illustrates the critical importance of effective communication within a corporation. Under Bernard Ebbers, WorldCom grew rapidly by capitalizing on telecom service opportunities. However, the company soon went bankrupt, with Ebbers facing multiple charges, including conspiracy, securities fraud, and filing false statements. His significant holdings in WorldCom stocks and loans were also examined. Top managers faced numerous charges, testifying against each other while denying knowledge of fraudulent activities.\n\nKnecht (2020) notes that 80% of employees typically feel their opinions are ignored, underscoring the detrimental impact of poor communication on WorldCom's downfall. Communication barriers such as motive distortion and self-absorption, where managers prioritized their own interests and selectively received information, created a toxic atmosphere that ultimately led to the corporation's collapse due to inadequately organized teamwork.",
    "The Bhagavad Gita is an ancient Indian text with 700 verses. It is part of the larger Mahabharata epic and is very important in Hinduism. Written in the late first millennium BC, the story revolves around a conversation between Arjuna, a Pandava prince, and Krishna, who is his charioteer and a divine guide. Krishna advises Arjuna on moral dilemmas, as the Pandavas must fight the Kauravas. \n\nArjuna is confident, proud, and skilled in battle. Krishna is wise, humble, and kind. They have a close bond: “Then, Madhava (Krishna) and the son of Pandu (Arjuna), stationed in their magnificent chariot with white horses yoked to it, loudly blew their divine conchs” (“Bhagavad Gita,” 2021, p. 13). Other characters include the Kaurava king Dhritarashtra and his adviser Sanjaya.\n\nThe epic tells of the battle of Kurukshetra, where two Indian armies fight for victory. Arjuna, troubled by the sight of friends and family on the battlefield, is reluctant to fight. Conflicted, he asks Krishna many questions about the war and ethical issues, ultimately dropping his bow in doubt.\n\nThe Bhagavad Gita discusses timeless themes like morality, justice, duty, and love. The dialogue between Arjuna and Krishna addresses deep ethical questions relevant to war and peace, touching on identity, the purpose of life, and human nature.",
    "TED Talks highlight the bio-psycho-social-spiritual issues causing some people to feel excluded from society. For example, Smith (2015) discusses differences in raising white and black children, while Abdel-Magied (2014) shows how clothing affects the treatment of Muslim women. Discrimination stems from layered bias, as noted by a New York Times article (2016) on non-white experiences of exclusion in the US. Bias, which can be automatic, ambiguous, and ambivalent, influences people's views and treatment of certain groups (Fiske, 2022). While I haven't personally faced discrimination, I’ve seen it impact the self-esteem and confidence of people I know. I aim to explore racial bias and its structural impact in today's society.",
    "The film “Coded Bias” dives into the issues surrounding facial recognition algorithms, highlighting several sources of bias. One major problem is that these systems were originally designed with a focus on white faces, leading to a lack of data on darker skin tones. Additionally, most developers are male, which introduces another layer of bias. These factors create significant racial and gender inequalities, posing a threat to the fairness of these technologies.\n\nAnother issue is the opacity of these algorithms—it's not always clear how they process data and reach conclusions, which complicates efforts to eliminate risks. To address the biases in current facial recognition technology, it's crucial to avoid using these systems in legal and police activities until they are improved. This involves updating databases to include more diverse data and conducting independent assessments to ensure effectiveness. By taking these steps, we can tackle race and gender biases over time and ensure these programs operate fairly.\n\nImplementing these measures is essential not only for enhancing the accuracy of these technologies but also for addressing surveillance concerns, especially for racial minorities. Ensuring accountability for these decisions is fundamental—fixing the algorithms can minimize or eliminate biases if they undergo both internal and external evaluations. The future of facial recognition in investigations hinges on specialists' efforts to correct these issues, addressing the major concerns raised by experts like Nakamura and Browne.",
    "The Caribbean's history is a dynamic tapestry woven with tales of ruthless colonization by Western powers like Spain. Before the colonizers arrived, native groups such as the Ciboney or Guanahuatebey, Taino Arawak, and Carib inhabited the region. With colonization, an influx of enslaved Africans was brought to toil in homes and plantations. Despite being a minority, the White colonizers exerted brutal control over the Black majority, who fought to retain their identity through vibrant cultural activities that still resonate today.\n\nThe Caribbean today is synonymous with musical genres that echo themes of human freedom and revolution. Reggae, often considered the unofficial soundtrack of Caribbean vacations, stands out as a powerful form of expression. Iconic musicians like Bob Marley and the Wailers used their revolutionary and redemptive songs to protest the oppressive White rule, channeling the collective anger and resilience of the Caribbean people.\n\nCultural identity in the Caribbean also flourishes through African-inspired cuisines and customs. Traditional dishes like the Callaloo, a beloved vegetable soup that is now a national dish in Trinidad and Tobago, showcase the enduring culinary legacy of the African diaspora. Parades and carnivals are extravagant celebrations that manifest the folklore and customs of African origin, commemorating significant historical events like slavery and reinforcing a distinct cultural heritage.\n\nThe African roots in the Caribbean are unmistakable, providing a strong sense of identity for the Black population. Despite the harsh oppression by the White minority, the Caribbean people have continuously expressed and asserted their rich cultural heritage through music, cuisine, and grand events. Reggae songs became anthems of resistance, while parades and carnivals serve as powerful reminders of their enduring spirit and history. The distinct African heritage in the Caribbean remains a vibrant testament to the resilience and creativity of its people.",
    "Society has always played a crucial role in shaping states, acting as a cornerstone for political and cultural evolution. When people communicate in groups, they exchange values, perspectives, and responses to various phenomena, collectively forming a public attitude that influences lifestyles and politics. Consequently, changes in civic life significantly impact states. In his essay \"Bowling Alone,\" Putnam highlights this idea, noting with concern that America's social fabric is unraveling, making it hard to foresee the consequences.\n\nHistorically, active participation in social processes has been a hallmark of American society, but the landscape is shifting. Putnam observes that \"tens of millions of Americans had forsaken their parents' habitual readiness to engage in the simplest act of citizenship\" (67). This shift toward isolation and detachment contrasts sharply with traditional U.S. social behavior. Moreover, long-standing clubs and organizations are being replaced by new, large-scale membership organizations. Putnam argues that these entities, while politically influential, fail to foster genuine civic engagement. He laments, \"For the vast majority of their members, the only act of membership consists in writing a check for dues or perhaps occasionally reading a newsletter\" (70). This statement underscores Putnam's concern about the growing disconnect among community members, who are increasingly divided and disengaged.\n\nIn the long run, this trend could lead to the collapse of civic life, a scenario that is difficult to predict given America's strong tradition of community relations. This is why Putnam warns that if nothing changes, we will end up bowling alone, isolated from one another.",
    "Heredity is a critical factor in breast cancer development, as genetic predisposition significantly increases risk. If a patient's close relatives have had breast cancer, the likelihood of developing a tumor is high, even at a young age (Coleman & Tsongalis, 2016). Various mammary gland diseases, like cystic breasts, also heighten the risk by causing atypical cell formations that may lead to overgrowth and severe disease (Tkaczuk et al., 2016). Hormonal factors further influence risk, particularly if the patient has had a first pregnancy after age 30, did not breastfeed, or used hormonal contraceptives for many years, disrupting hormonal balance and complicating the body's ability to manage abnormal processes with age. Early-stage cancer may not show metastasis, but aggressive forms can metastasize early. Histological analysis can help determine cancer aggressiveness, and imaging like CT or scintigraphy can detect metastases in the lungs, liver, bones, and brain. Importantly, breast cancer metastases can remain dormant for years, even after the primary tumor's removal, highlighting the need for vigilant long-term monitoring.",
    "International labor laws forbid making employment decisions based on age or disabilities. Thus, Etihad Airways violated these regulations with its layoff strategy. Given that social justice is vital for multinational companies, Etihad’s actions appear unethical and inappropriate. Greater employee involvement in decision-making could have prevented this issue, ensuring fair decisions that consider workers’ input, enhancing performance.\n\nEtihad succeeded in compensating employees, which is vital for job security and motivation, benefiting both the company and future rehiring prospects. However, the reduction in job security during the change process led to diminished confidence and motivation among employees. Ensuring secure positions is crucial for employee engagement and effective performance.\n\nDiscrimination was also evident during Etihad Airways’ changes, disregarding corporate social responsibility and leading to dissatisfaction, lack of motivation, and engagement. The company overlooked alternatives to its discriminatory practices, affecting job security and willingness to work.\n\nOverall, lack of employee involvement was a core issue. Etihad’s top management made changes without substantial employee input, resulting in an ineffective and unpopular strategy. This oversight diminished workers' motivation and sense of importance. Modern employees need opportunities to participate in decisions to feel valued and motivated.\n\nEtihad Airways made a poor decision in managing its wage bill, seeing layoffs as the only option. Using disability and age as criteria violated labor laws and compromised job security, leading to employee vulnerability. The outcomes demonstrated the low effectiveness of this strategy. Due to the insufficient workforce, remaining employees experienced burnout and stress, which, coupled with low motivation and engagement, affected their performance. Thus, Etihad Airways struggled to meet its objectives, highlighting the critical importance of involving employees in decision-making during organizational changes.",
    "Every business needs careful management, with attention to every detail. This is especially true in healthcare, where the focus is on people’s well-being. Managing a healthcare facility can be demanding, both mentally and financially. As a Chief Nursing Officer (CNO), you’ll need to uphold principles like integrity, proper cash flow management, and employee motivation.\n\nFirst and foremost, maintaining integrity is crucial in a healthcare setting. Effective communication is essential in any business, making integrity a key component (Fisher, 2008). At our facility, we place a high importance on integrity. Every doctor adheres to an ethical code that includes doctor-patient confidentiality. Additionally, doctors and nurses prioritize honest communication with patients. For example, I always inform patients about their actual conditions and answer their questions truthfully.\n\nProper cash flow management is another vital principle. Healthcare facilities often need renovations and new equipment (Mason et al., 2020). Implementing these changes is crucial to avoid jeopardizing patients’ health and well-being. For instance, as a CNO, I managed the replacement of power generators. This upgrade allowed our staff to work without issues during a storm and power outage.\n\nLastly, motivating and managing employees is essential. It’s important to appreciate and reward hard-working staff in a healthcare facility. At our facility, we offer employees extra days off and gift cards, helping them feel heard and supported. Without these measures, nurses and doctors might experience burnout and lose their motivation to deliver high-quality care.\n\nThese principles were chosen for their significant impact on both employees and patients. Implementing them has led to positive outcomes and satisfied all involved parties. I believe these values are fundamental to healthcare. Without them, trust and respect between healthcare personnel and patients would be compromised, and patient care would suffer.",
    "Mythology’s timeless allure has captivated scholars for ages, sparking curiosity about its enduring impact on culture. Joseph Campbell's electrifying book, \"The Hero with a Thousand Faces,\" dives deep into this phenomenon, uncovering how myths, steeped in psychological insight, shape humanity's cultural patterns. In this whirlwind paper, we spotlight the riveting first chapter, “Myth and Dream.” Campbell shakes things up with this explosive claim: myths “are dangerous because they threaten the fabric of the security into which we have built ourselves and our family. But they are fiendishly fascinating too, for they carry keys that open the whole realm of the desired and feared adventure of the discovery of the self” (Campbell, 2004, p. 7). This bold assertion suggests that our minds weave myths and dreams to navigate self-perception, life’s grand cycles, and developmental shifts.\n\nMyths act as guides through life's hurdles, merging the conscious and subconscious into one dynamic framework. Before dropping the bombshell quote, Campbell (2004) mentions how ancient mythological fears and irrationalities pop up in modern dreams. Emotions like hatred, vanity, and jealousy collide with love and gratitude, driving us to action. These mythic elements shake us because they expose the deep psychological roots of our subconscious, often clashing with our logical decisions.\n\nCampbell intensifies the narrative by sharing real-life letters from people about their myth-like dreams, revealing their subconscious battles. A young man's dream of patricide to win his mother’s affection mirrors recurring mythological themes. Similarly, a woman’s dream featuring a centaur reflects deep-seated, subconscious turmoil, despite her conscious life being devoid of infidelity thoughts.\n\nThe fusion of early childhood and adult experiences is key to understanding myths and their dream manifestations. This epiphany clarifies the second part of Campbell’s quote, illustrating how these myth-infused dreams help people decode their inner selves and the subconscious triggers of their actions and emotions. Buckle up for a thrilling exploration of the mysterious dance between myth and mind!",
    "Fad diets recently have claimed that carbohydrates are harmful to the body. However, this idea has been debunked multiple times. For a healthy, well-functioning body, nutrients such as fats, proteins, carbohydrates, and water are essential (Nazario). Carbohydrates are crucial because their metabolism provides essential energy for the nervous system and brain, and it ensures the proper metabolism of proteins and fats. Without them, there's a high risk of persistent fatigue that can lead to depression. Moreover, avoiding carbohydrates can result in weight gain. After ending a carb-free diet, the body becomes highly receptive to carbohydrates, leading to increased appetite and enhanced absorption of carbs (Nazario). For instance, someone might lose ten pounds on a carb-free diet in a month, only to gain it back quickly when returning to a regular diet. Additionally, cutting out carbohydrates can cause symptoms like slight malaise and headaches almost immediately (Nazario). Over time, this can escalate to chronic headaches and migraines. Carbohydrates are also the brain's primary energy source, and their absence can diminish cognitive functions since the brain requires carbs to stay active. Lack of carbohydrates can severely reduce concentration levels and lead to impaired brain function due to the constant burning of ketones instead of glucose. Thus, incorporating carbohydrates into one's diet is crucial for the proper functioning of all bodily systems.",

Another viable option is issuing bonds, a fixed-income instrument that serves as a debt obligation, borrowing funds from investors. Bonds are typically safer for investors, offering a quick financing method for the company.\n\nLastly, mixed funding, combining several of these methods, is another strategy. All these financing options can help in acquiring and implementing the Advanced Documentation System, ensuring a scalable and budget-friendly solution for improving printing operations.",
    "The Rolling Stones were initially overshadowed by the Beatles, which troubled them considerably. While most fame went to the Beatles, the Rolling Stones continually sensed the Beatles' superiority. To differentiate themselves, they aimed to become the anti-Beatles. The Beatles pioneered hard rock, with \"Helter Skelter\" influencing the development of heavy metal (Covach and Bell 28). The impact of the Rolling Stones on rock music was immense, affecting not just music but also artistry, visual style, image, and media presence. In songwriting, the Rolling Stones struggled to match the Beatles and often seemed a step behind. Many of their actions were reactions to the Beatles' innovations, such as incorporating a sitar after the Beatles did.\n\nThe Beatles, from working-class Liverpool, maintained a polished image with neat suits, short hair, and polite demeanor (Covach and Bell 28). In contrast, the Rolling Stones adopted a provocative look with black leather attire. When the Beatles first arrived in the US in 1964, it was termed the British Invasion, and they dominated the Billboard singles chart, claiming all top five positions—a record yet unbeaten (Covach and Bell 28). Although the Rolling Stones also succeeded in the US with a shocking approach, they did not dethrone the Beatles. Despite being perceived as irreconcilable rivals due to their divergent music and images, both bands significantly influenced global music and remain highly recognizable.",
    "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a persistent and long-term condition marked by uncontrollable, recurring thoughts and behaviors that individuals feel compelled to repeat. Let's explore the case of Robert, a twenty-three-year-old man, whose journey sheds light on this challenging disorder. Initially seeking treatment for anxiety, it quickly became apparent that Robert was struggling with OCD. The strong scent of disinfectant clung to him, and he described relentless cleaning rituals.\n\nAfter touching surfaces or being around people, Robert felt an overwhelming urge to wash his hands with bleach, sometimes scrubbing up to thirty times a day, severely damaging his skin. Yet, the fear of germs overshadowed the physical pain, making it impossible for him to touch anything without immediately washing his hands. His obsession with cleanliness took a severe toll on his mental well-being, exacerbating during the pandemic. Robert took extreme measures, like wearing a HAZMAT suit when outdoors, to avoid contracting the virus.\n\nSocially, Robert maintains a significant distance from others, avoiding physical contact and finding solace in remote work. This arrangement suits him well, freeing him from the anxiety of confined spaces and close interactions. Robert's independence is notable; he navigates his OCD largely on his own, favoring solitude.\n\nFor Robert, a tailored combination of behavior therapy and medication offers hope. Cognitive-behavioral treatment, including exposure and response prevention, along with cognitive restructuring, can be effective strategies (Moody, 2017). With these interventions, there is optimism that Robert will experience significant relief from his symptoms within a few weeks.",
    "A thorough physical examination of the affected skin regions is imperative. Patients with cellulitis typically exhibit erythema, swelling, and significant pain (Brown & Watson, 2022). Brant is experiencing pain in his right leg, specifically in a reddened and swollen area. Close inspection of the affected region for any signs of skin disintegration is warranted. Additionally, monitoring for temperature variations in the area, as well as indications of an abscess, is essential (Sutherland & Parent, 2017). Brant has reported that he was bitten by a mosquito in the reddened area. Given the severity of his condition, the physician may consider ordering a complete blood count (CBC) test to measure blood cell levels (Bennett et al., 2020). This test can facilitate the early and accurate diagnosis of a variety of medical conditions. Furthermore, a C-reactive protein (CRP) test, which detects inflammation, may be necessary due to the presence of broken skin from the mosquito bite (Sutherland & Parent, 2017).\n\nBrant’s case appears to involve significant systemic disturbance, as evidenced by chills and acute disorientation. Priority diagnostic criteria should include an assessment of erythematous inflammation extending to the basal dermis and subcutaneous tissue. Erythema, swelling, and pain are classic signs of cellulitis (Sutherland & Parent, 2017). The presence of erythema is crucial for diagnosis. Additionally, the location and condition of the broken skin should be evaluated. For a conclusive diagnosis of cellulitis, the patient’s skin should be examined for micro-abrasions caused by insect bites (Brown & Watson, 2022). The lower limbs are frequently affected in such cases.\n\nBrant’s positioning and movement require adjustment. To alleviate swelling in the dependent areas, it is advised that Brant’s feet and arms be elevated on cushions while he lies supine (Zariquiey-Esteva & Santa-Candela, 2017). Prolonged standing may impede venous return to the heart, potentially resulting in hypotension. If Brant experiences nausea or has the urge to vomit, he should be placed in the recovery position on his side. His symptoms of nausea, weakness, and frequent vomiting warrant this precaution (Zariquiey-Esteva & Santa-Candela, 2017). This measure will help prevent hypotension.\n\nWhen pathogens breach the skin barrier, cytokines and neutrophils are mobilized to combat the infection, leading to the clinical manifestations of cellulitis, including erythema, warmth, swelling, and pain (Brown & Watson, 2022). This situation appears applicable to Brant, who experienced a mosquito bite that compromised his skin integrity, allowing Streptococcus pyogenes to infiltrate the area. The subsequent immune response involved the recruitment of cytokines and neutrophils to the site, resulting in the observed outbreak of redness and swelling (Brown & Watson, 2022).",
    "One of the key features of nursing is how nurses constantly have to adapt to the ever-changing healthcare environment and different approaches to patient care. To help with this, researchers have developed various change theories that aim to make the process of implementing new practices more organized (Udod & Wagner, 2018). The two most commonly used change theories in nursing are Lewin’s change theory and Roger’s five-step theory.\n\nLewin’s theory breaks down the change process into three main stages: unfreezing, change, and refreezing (Udod & Wagner, 2018). Basically, to introduce a new change, the team first needs to understand and let go of the current workflow (unfreezing), then actively implement the new changes (changing), and finally, make the new practices standard (refreezing).\n\nOn the other hand, Roger’s model focuses more on how staff respond to and accept the change gradually. This five-step model involves thorough preliminary research, gathering staff feedback, conducting a pilot study, and then actually implementing the change (Udod & Wagner, 2018). While Lewin’s model is more about implementing evidence-based modifications, Roger’s model is designed to prove that the suggested changes are beneficial in a clinical setting.\n\nFor the capstone project, Roger’s approach seems more fitting. The project aims to validate the hypothesis that EBP training boosts nurses’ self-esteem and improves patient satisfaction. The data collected from the intervention will be essential for further integrating this change into nursing practice. Plus, the preceptor has successfully used Roger’s model to make changes in staff scheduling, which supports the effectiveness of this approach.",
    "Understanding the difference between a leader and a regular employee is crucial. While company heads often focus on financial processes, effective leaders recognize the critical importance of employees. A good leader sees potential in every individual and helps them grow without applying pressure. Poor leadership can have severe negative effects on a business. Sadly, ineffective leaders are common across various fields, causing issues on both personal and global levels. Identifying such leaders can be challenging without direct experience and evidence. \n\nFor example, Jack Ma, the owner of AliExpress, has been implicated in exploiting underage children from impoverished areas to produce goods. This exploitation, carried out with Ma’s implied consent, highlights clear human rights violations. A bad leader views people merely as cheap labor, driven by ignorance and selfishness, leading to negative outcomes. Nevertheless, such allegations must be backed by thorough investigation.\n\nExploiting people in any relationship, whether business or political, is unsustainable. The best professionals will leave for better conditions. Many leaders fail due to their egocentric worldview and immoral exploitation of human resources.",
    "One of the essential tasks for an organization is to create a contract that ensures all parties understand and fulfill their obligations. Charles Schwab, a company that provides banking and brokerage services, has designed a contract for its users to sign to ensure both parties meet their respective requirements (Reder et al., 2021). This collaboration framework includes all critical components of a legal agreement, making it effective. The contract starts with clear definitions of key concepts, establishing offer, acceptance, and legality terms very distinctly from the outset. This clarity and transparency are advantageous for both the company and its customers, fostering immediate trust and cooperation (Templin, 2017). Notably, Schwab's contract also provides a strong foundation for the consideration element, addressing legal issues related to the disbursement process and associated trading concerns (“Schwab account agreement,” 2022). By stating that Schwab is not responsible for tracking the trading process, the contract clearly defines the responsibilities and relationships between the parties. By including the main components of a legal contract, Schwab’s brokerage agreement allows customers to understand the services they will receive and their own responsibilities. Likewise, it specifies Schwab’s crucial duties, creating a foundation for effective cooperation and successful service delivery. Overall, Schwab's method of contract development is a model example due to its focus on key issues and the clear delineation of the roles and rights of all parties involved.",
    "Primary sources provide first-hand evidence of events or phenomena under study, such as diaries, photographs, video/audio recordings, interview transcripts, works of art, and statistical data. These sources allow researchers to learn directly from those who witnessed or experienced the events. For example, reports, documents, local newspapers, photographs, and witness interviews from the time of the Chernobyl Nuclear Plant Disaster are invaluable. Primary sources offer unbiased facts and immerse researchers in the context and circumstances of the investigated matter. For historians and archaeologists, items like ancient fossils or tribal belongings are both information-rich and inspirational. For political or environmental analyses, contemporary reports and news releases are key primary sources.\n\nIn contrast, secondary sources provide second-hand information and analyses from other researchers, including books, reviews, and scholarly articles. They help deepen understanding of both the phenomenon and the primary sources by synthesizing the material on the topic.\n\nConsulting a variety of sources during historical research is crucial as primary and secondary sources complement each other. Primary sources offer credible evidence, while secondary sources add synthesis and context. Relying on multiple sources increases credibility, uncovers additional valuable evidence, and invites new questions and insights. A thorough research approach requires a wide range of sources and different types to maximize the depth and reliability of the findings.",
    "The development of the Chesapeake colonies is a fascinating example of how slavery became a cornerstone of societies on these lands. The urgent need to grow specific crops and leverage them for survival and profit led to a soaring demand for labor. The practice of using indentured servants fell short due to the expiration of their contracts, creating an urgent necessity for a more permanent labor source. This issue was critical—without the ability to cultivate crops, the entire community faced possible extinction (Kidd, 2019). Under these high-stakes circumstances, the establishment of slavery was inevitable. Individuals deprived of their rights could be exploited indefinitely, laying the groundwork for the evolution of slavery as a fundamental institution on these lands.\n\nSimilarly, the Middle colonies present a compelling case where the use of enslaved people for labor became unavoidable. Despite the Quaker principles of peace that initially dominated these colonies, settlers still required a labor force to undertake complex tasks and drive the colonies' growth. Given the limited influx of new settlers, slavery emerged as the viable solution to offset the labor shortage and enable future expansion. This pattern ran parallel in both the Middle and Chesapeake colonies, reflecting the unique attitudes toward slavery prevalent at the time (Huntley, 2019). People were ready to further entrench this institution as the linchpin for developing the agricultural sector, essential for their survival and enrichment.",
    "Daniel Spanjer claims that the Christian worldview influences the study of Liberal Arts, noting that human thought and feeling are beyond natural (Spanjer 3). He argues that thinkers can answer both logical and surreal questions, using the term \"worldview\" to describe a holistic concept of learning and knowledge (Spanjer 15). Despite occasional disagreements, time reveals false beliefs. Brad Green, in his work, explores the link between words and faith, emphasizing that language loses its magnificence without transcendence (Green). He asserts that God's word is meant to save humanity and that following the Bible is crucial. Without meaning, speech is useless. Dockery discusses how the Christian faith impacts learning, urging people to use Christian principles to guide their thoughts and beliefs (Dockery 4, 8). He calls for thoughtful believers to revive faith-based higher education and promote good deeds. Thus, the Christian worldview is seen as essential for successful education.",
    "Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation (NDT) is a European scientific and clinical journal focused on the study of dialysis, transplantation, and nephrology research. It is officially endorsed by the European Renal Association (ERA) and provides significant analyses and data beneficial to scientists globally. Additionally, an article from StatPearls, sourced from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), contributes to this research. StatPearls’ article investigates the primary causes of chronic inflammation during end-stage renal failure, highlighting the disease’s impact on clinical outcomes and the role of middle molecules in the onset of pathology. It also reviews the latest breakthroughs in dialysis to manage the condition.\n\nEnd-stage kidney damage represents the final phase of chronic renal failure, posing severe risks to health and life. Early signs include reduced urine output (diuresis), while stage 2 may introduce symptoms like nausea and increased urine production. By stage 3, fluid retention escalates, diuresis ceases, kidney failure ensues, and acute renal failure develops, worsening the patient’s condition. Treatment typically involves medication.\n\nChronic renal failure affects approximately 200-500 per million people, with the prevalence rate rising annually by 10-12%. In advanced stages, the disease causes pulmonary edema, with an estimated prevalence of around 759 per million people. Global incidence rates are challenging to detail, but newly reported cases average 144 per million. The mortality rate has decreased to approximately 28%. Diagnostic measures include blood tests for creatinine, potassium, and urea, kidney ultrasounds, and if necessary, renal pelvis catheterization and renal angiography.",
    "Elephants dance, sea lions juggle, bears ride bicycles, and tigers jump through burning hoops – these circus acts entertain audiences, especially children. However, animal rights activists condemn these acts as unnatural and cruel. There should be a complete ban on using animals in circuses, as it violates humane treatment and their rights. Since the 1970s, many nations have enacted laws to protect animals, recognizing them as sentient beings whose basic needs must be respected (Marino 148). Circus tricks do not reflect natural animal behavior and often involve punishment and food deprivation (Arnold-Foster 146). Animals should maintain natural behaviors, but circuses contradict this. Unlike human actors, animals do not choose to perform and are confined in cramped cages for most of their lives (Ward 131). They suffer with no way to change their plight. Therefore, banning animal exploitation in circuses is essential. Animals deserve to follow their instincts in their natural habitats, and people should refuse to support performances created through violence and cruelty.",
    "The Commitment to Health Theory is a specialized model designed to identify the stages of development and behavioral changes. This theory posits the development of an internal state and the acceptance of the desire to lead a healthy lifestyle, even under limiting circumstances. It determines necessary levels to indicate specific stages of human health (Kelly, 2014). Furthermore, the theory assumes that there are no inherent differences, such as gender or race, in shaping behavior aimed at developing a healthy lifestyle. Kelly (2008) utilizes the principles of the Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change to demonstrate various stages of the change process and sets specific health requirements. The Commitment to Health Theory incorporates principles such as stages of change, decisional balance, and self-efficacy (Prochaska & Velicer, 1997). Kelly leverages these essential principles, making them interrelated.\n\nIn advanced nursing practice, this theory can measure various patient indicators, helping to set goals necessary to instill a desire for a healthy lifestyle. It helps track the process of change and guides interactions with patients (Kelly, 2008). For example, in the first stage, the goal is to instill confidence and highlight the importance of necessary changes. In the second stage, strategies are applied to strengthen the patient's desire to improve overall health. The third and final stage introduces behavioral patterns necessary for maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Consequently, healthcare professionals can use stages of change categories and commitment ratings to personalize therapy, employing change-specific tactics and motivating therapeutic communication techniques.",
    "Being an adept and seasoned professional within one's respective field is undeniably crucial. As such, many medical students strive to amass a wealth of both theoretical knowledge and practical experience before they graduate. While this approach is certainly valid, I have come to realize that true success in healthcare is often rooted in a physician’s ability to forge meaningful relationships with their patients. \n\nThis profound insight became clear to me while observing the work of Dr. Wang, an accomplished eye surgeon. What struck me most about Dr. Wang was not just his/her technical expertise, but his/her remarkable ease in creating strong connections with patients. By closely analyzing Dr. Wang's interactions, I identified several key skills that help him/her earn the trust of those who come to the Eye Surgery Institute.\n\nFirstly, Dr. Wang is an active listener. This means that he/she encourages patients to openly express their symptoms and emotions without interruption, fostering an environment where they feel truly heard. Secondly, regardless of his/her personal mood, Dr. Wang consistently demonstrates politeness and patience. Lastly, he/she shows genuine friendliness and interest in the lives of regular patients. For instance, I overheard Dr. Wang inquiring about a patient's daughter’s health, recalling that the daughter had been ill during a previous visit. \n\nThis kind of attentive care engenders trust, allowing patients to share their concerns more freely, which in turn enables Dr. Wang to provide more accurate and effective treatment. Witnessing the positive impact of such rapport on healthcare outcomes has inspired me to cultivate similar skills in my own practice. \n\nMoreover, I hope that my account of Dr. Wang’s exemplary practices will motivate current and future medical professionals to prioritize and develop their communication skills, recognizing that building trustful relationships is as vital as medical proficiency in delivering exceptional care.",
    "The lack of healthy food options is a social factor that impacts grocery purchases. To gather information on available products and their prices, I visited the Wal-Mart in Forest Park. Here are some examples: a gallon of Great Value milk costs $2.65, a loaf of Sara Lee bread is $2.44, a bag of Gala apples is $3.58, and a bag of organic baby carrots is $3.88. Additionally, a yogurt container is priced at $1.92, a 2-liter bottle of Pepsi is $1.98, a bag of chips costs $2.84, and a family-size pack of cookies is $3.98.\n\nIn Maywood, IL 60153, the majority of the population is African American (68.6%), with white residents comprising 18.2% and Hispanic/Latino individuals making up 26.9% of the community (United States Census Bureau, n.d.). This area lacks good grocery stores, yet the number of fast-food restaurants has risen significantly in recent years. Consequently, people are often left with no choice but to consume poor-quality food, leading to health issues like hypertension and diabetes. \n\nAnother factor affecting health and shopping habits is limited transportation, which makes it difficult for the working class to visit Wal-Mart regularly. The median household income in this area is around $50,176, and the poverty level is approximately 15% (United States Census Bureau, n.d.), indicating that not everyone can afford to shop at stores offering healthy options. The combination of transportation, low income, and limited food access is critical for public health (Islam, 2019).\n\nAddressing these issues requires identifying solutions to improve conditions. Community health nurses (CHNs) play a critical role in promoting public health and addressing food security. As noted by Schaffer and Strohschein (2019), there are 17 interventions categorized into five groups, emphasizing the importance of collaboration to enhance community health. This intervention involves a high commitment level, partnership, and goal orientation (Schaffer & Strohschein, 2019). Through collaboration at various levels, including systems, communities, and families, CHNs can reach relevant stakeholders, assess current situations, and increase personal engagement and knowledge.",
    "Throughout human history, the computer stands out as one of the most transformative innovations. Nowadays, it's nearly impossible to envision a modern household or workplace without these devices. Opinions diverge, however, with some celebrating the conveniences computers bring while others bemoan the added complexity and stress they introduce. Personally, I contend that computers have significantly enhanced our lives, primarily through speedier communication and easier access to information.\n\nComputers have revolutionized the way we communicate. In our increasingly global society, they are pivotal to modern communication systems. Historically, methods like postal mail were the norm (Grudin, 2017), causing considerable delays, particularly for business travelers sending reports or updates from abroad – a severe drawback in a time-sensitive industry. The advent of the Internet changed that, enabling businesses to transmit messages instantaneously. Employees can now send emails or instant messages to managers around the globe (Grudin, 2017), boosting efficiency and broadening business opportunities.\n\nOn a personal note, I find computers indispensable, enhancing both my enjoyment and daily routine. They're fantastic for leisure, allowing me to easily watch movies and enjoy various sci-fi programs. Moreover, my job, which constitutes my primary source of income, relies heavily on computer use, making it not just a medium for interaction and entertainment, but also an essential tool for my livelihood.\n\nIn the healthcare sector, computers are invaluable. Medical professionals leverage computer technology for a multitude of critical tasks. For instance, computer hardware aids in making diagnoses and conducting both examinations and preventive check-ups (Farinella & Marco, 2018). Techniques like computed tomography and nuclear medical diagnostics deliver precise, layered images of internal organ structures (Farinella & Marco, 2018). Additionally, ultrasound diagnostics utilize the interaction of incident and reflected ultrasonic waves to generate detailed images of internal organs, vastly improving diagnostic capabilities. Ultimately, computers simplify and enhance the methods of diagnosis and treatment in healthcare.\n\nIn summary, while there's some debate over their impact, I firmly believe computers have brought considerable advantages. They've made our world faster, more connected, and introduced myriad possibilities in both personal and professional realms.",
    "In the realm of building construction, a Code of Practice refers to a specific set of standards, procedures, and regulations that contractors and developers must follow to mitigate potential environmental impacts resulting from construction activities. This code is particularly relevant for large clients, local authorities, and public bodies, as it outlines the necessary requirements to address the environmental and societal impacts of new developments. The primary objective is to provide comprehensive guidance within the legal, administrative, and technical frameworks to protect workers, the environment, and the public, as well as to manage major hazard installations.\n\nAccording to the Code of Practice, major accidents at hazard installations can be prevented by ensuring adequate separation between large population centers—such as residential areas, commercial zones, schools, and hospitals—and major hazard installations. Additionally, it calls for the development of effective emergency response plans. The code applies to major hazard installations identified based on a list of hazardous substances and their threshold quantities. Such installations warrant special attention due to their potential to cause significant incidents that could adversely affect the environment and human health. Examples of major hazard installations include oil refineries, petrochemical and chemical plants, storage facilities for flammable liquids and gases, fertilizer plants, chemical warehouses, and water treatment facilities using chlorine.\n\nHowever, the code does not cover nuclear hazards, military-related hazards, or the transportation of potentially hazardous chemicals due to the distinct nature of their control and management processes.\n\nOverall, the Code of Practice outlines a series of activities that competent authorities must undertake to establish effective major hazard control systems aimed at incident prevention. Competent authorities encompass government inspectorates, safety authorities, police, local authorities, workers and their representatives, industrial management, fire and health authorities, suppliers of major hazard technologies, and other relevant organizations.",
    "In today’s world, the fate of Confederate statues sparks fervent debate. Former President Donald Trump's official stance insists these monuments are crucial historical symbols of the United States worthy of protection. Yet, mounting evidence bolsters the public view that these statues should be removed, as they epitomize racial disparities and white supremacy.\n\nThe core argument here is compelling: most Confederate monuments were erected not immediately after the Civil War, but between 1900 and the 1920s (Best, 2020). This era coincided with the enactment of numerous discriminatory laws against Black social rights, marking a time when the United Daughters of the Confederacy sponsored the erection of these monuments. Today, these actions are recognized as part of a deliberate strategy to reinforce white supremacy and racial inequalities.\n\nThe link between these statues and systemic racism becomes even clearer during the second surge of erecting Confederate monuments from the 1920s to the 1940s, against the backdrop of Black Americans’ fight for civil rights and resistance against rampant lynchings in the South (Best, 2020, para. 4). Strategically placed, especially on courthouse grounds, these monuments symbolized the legal protection of white supremacy.\n\nThe irrefutable racial undertones of these monuments have led to a wave of removals or relocations in recent years, driven by the ongoing struggle against racial discrimination. Personally, it's evident that Confederate statues are inextricably linked to the perpetuation of white supremacy. This recognition justifies the removal of many such statues—though perhaps not all.\n\nHuman history embodies both triumphs and tragedies. While many advocate for the erasure of dark symbols from our past, it's crucial to remember them. Acknowledging past mistakes is essential to ensure they are not repeated in the future.",
    "Conflict management in healthcare is crucial due to the inherent complexities of the work. McKibben (2017) notes that conflict is inevitable in such settings, and if ignored, it can decrease employee performance and satisfaction, negatively impacting patient care (Suifan, Alhyari, & Sweis, 2020). Effective conflict resolution requires understanding its causes, which can be individual, interpersonal, or organizational.\n\nIndividual conflicts arise from factors like self-esteem, emotional intelligence, communication styles, and personal backgrounds (Kim et al., 2017; Chang, Chen, & Chen, 2017). Interpersonal conflicts are driven by lack of trust, power abuse, and ineffective communication (Kim et al., 2017). Organizational conflicts result from unclear responsibilities and inadequate hierarchy (Kim et al., 2017; McKibben, 2017).\n\nI have experienced conflicts due to these factors: a self-focused friend causing disagreements, my emotional management issues with parents and friends, and a poorly defined team project leading to disputes with classmates.",
    "In numerous philosophical traditions, certain archetypes embody the notion of the perfect self, exemplifying the ideal way to live one's life. In Confucianism, this archetype is known as the junzi – a noble person or gentleman – and striving toward this ideal is a common aspiration (Yu-kit 223). The junzi represents a near-unreachable pinnacle of human qualities, yet one that commands profound respect across cultures. This essay delves into the attributes of the Confucian gentleman and juxtaposes this ideal with Plato’s philosopher-king. \n\nRooted in traditional Chinese culture, the concept of the junzi continues to resonate in society today. Such a person stands above malevolent ideas, recognizing and counteracting them to the best of their abilities (Yu-kit 225). Moreover, the Confucian gentleman extends this wisdom to others, fulfilling the role of both exemplar and educator (Yu-kit 223). Yu-kit notes that Confucius envisioned the noble person as one who embodies virtues so thoroughly that they become second nature, demonstrating them daily (224). The Confucian gentleman lives by the highest moral standards, inspiring others to achieve the same.\n\nPlato’s philosopher-king shares several similarities with the junzi, aiming to exhibit virtuous qualities while using reason to combat negative traits. Humility and stoicism define this philosopher-king, who continually seeks wisdom for the betterment of society (Mark). However, Plato's ideal leans more toward intellectual leadership and education rather than serving as a day-to-day role model.\n\nIn conclusion, both the junzi and the philosopher-king encapsulate the essence of a noble person, marked by virtues like kindness, fairness, selflessness, and a quest for harmony. Yet, while Plato’s model prioritizes wisdom and intellectual leadership, the Confucian gentleman upholds moral values as the cornerstone of his existence. Despite their nuanced differences, both archetypes strive to uplift personal values in others through their selflessness and benevolence.",
    "Corporate entrepreneurship is the dynamic process where teams within a corporation build and nurture new businesses that, while distinct, leverage the parent company's strengths in holdings, competitive positioning, and expertise. These innovative ventures defy conventional norms, aiming to spur economic growth through meticulous planning and flexible strategies that large firms have honed over time (Demirkan et al., 2019).\n\nRather than resting on their laurels, leading global corporations like Amazon and Samsung are actively pursuing bold innovation projects to stay ahead of disruptions. Take Amazon Custom, for example. This groundbreaking initiative enables suppliers to offer personalized products on Amazon, marking a significant evolution in their approach to both incremental and radical innovation (Demirkan et al., 2019).\n\nSamsung’s innovative strategy, on the other hand, involves entrusting new projects to a skilled “creative elite,” ensuring they incorporate best practices to maximize key performance indicators (KPIs) (Demirkan et al., 2019). These top innovators employ open innovation and corporate technical scouting techniques to unearth and develop new product ideas using a bottom-up strategy. A prime example is the iPod, which was developed through the collective ingenuity and technical expertise of the company's employees, aligning seamlessly with existing company strategies.\n\nMeanwhile, inspired strategic behavior takes a top-down approach, integrating new policies through the company's established hierarchical structure. The development of the iPhone exemplifies this strategic process, rooted in the firm's existing methodologies.\n\nUltimately, the focus of these creative strategies is on human ingenuity rather than just technology. They encourage the continuous infusion of new ideas, products, and processes into individual roles. As employees become specialists, they drive fresh innovation within the company (Demirkan et al., 2019).",
    "Modern understanding, as well as perspectives from the 1930s, suggest that the Second World War was unavoidable. Some argue that the United States could have prevented the war, but this scenario is improbable for several reasons. During the 1930s, the American government adhered to an isolationist foreign policy. The era was marked by severe economic challenges that every nation had to confront (Corbett et al., 2021). Americans focused on domestic issues, including the looming threat of communist ideologies (Russett, 2019). Additionally, the United States' comparatively limited economic power at the time meant it could not significantly influence European affairs. \n\nThe US was not an economic leader, constraining its international influence. Moreover, the outbreak of the war stemmed from conflicts among European powers, making unilateral American intervention ineffective. The Treaty of Versailles sowed the seeds for further conflict, leaving almost all involved parties dissatisfied. Germany rebuilt its resources and formed alliances with other dictatorships, ensuring that no single country could decisively alter the impending conflict. The rise of regimes such as the communist USSR, Nazi Germany, and fascist Italy made a new military engagement, escalating into a global war, almost inevitable.\n\nConsequently, it is reasonable to conclude that the United States could not have prevented the onset of the Second World War, even if it had forsaken its isolationist stance. Nevertheless, the US played a crucial role in bringing the war to an end and establishing a new world order.",
    "Dive into the transformative impact of COVID-19 on the nursing profession with our deep analysis of Fauteux’s compelling article, “COVID-19: Impact on Nurses and Nursing” (2021). The abstract serves as a quick portal into the heart of the discussion but leaves much to be desired regarding research methods or concrete results. Unlike the abstract, the introduction bursts with relevance, offering a panoramic view of how the pandemic has reshaped nursing. It grounds readers with hard-hitting statistics and insightful context, highlighting grave issues such as increased mortality, shifts in work practices, and escalating workloads.\n\nThe study's qualitative approach, reviewing a plethora of existing research, unveils significant transformations within nursing. Utilizing pre-processed quantitative data, the research identifies four main areas of change: intensified collaboration and innovation, the dismantling of practice barriers, the surge of telemedicine, and the heightened risk of burnout among nurses. The revelation of the amplified risks of burnout particularly stands out, painting a stark picture of the overwhelming workload nurses face.\n\nMoreover, the rise of telemedicine due to the pandemic is both surprising and telling, indicating a seismic shift in patient attitudes towards healthcare post-virus. This article is an invaluable resource for anyone eager to understand how a global health crisis can revolutionize a crucial segment of the medical field, shedding light on the resilience and adaptability of nursing under extreme duress.",
    "Historically, the establishment of law enforcement was rooted in the need to protect citizens' safety, property, and health, as well as to defend the community against civil unrest and criminal activities. According to Harris (2020), law enforcement was granted powers by the government, including the legitimate use of force and the ability to make arrests, essentially holding a monopoly on violence. In its early form, law enforcement saw community members unite to impose the group's rules on any individuals who deviated. The aim of these actions was to maintain societal directives, manage human behavior, and authorize the enforcement of those rules to protect the community from offenders.\n\nCommunities viewed violence against any individual as equivalent to an attack on everyone (Harris, 2020). Consequently, early law enforcement featured three core principles: the absence of coercion, a broad range of responsibilities, and a clear distinction between those legally empowered to enforce laws and those performing policing tasks. Peace officers were mandated to avoid criminal acts, whether on duty or off, in accordance with the nation’s laws. In the U.S., for instance, peace officers are prohibited by local and state jurisdictions from committing crimes. Their duties include adhering strictly to criminal procedures, particularly regarding detention, arrests, evidence preservation, and the use of informants (Schroeder & Lombardo, 2018).\n\nMoreover, peace officers must not abuse their authority when enforcing laws, nor should they infringe on individual freedoms (Schroeder & Lombardo, 2018). The sole exception to these rules is when the law explicitly permits peace officers to bypass regular criminal procedures.",
    "The issue of slavery has been one of the most devastating influences on the lives of people of African descent over the years. To understand these concepts thoroughly, it's crucial to examine the origins of racism and slavery. In the chapter “The Origin of Negro Slavery,” Williams points out that while slavery is now closely associated with the exploitation of African Americans, it initially included people from various races and ethnicities (Williams 7). Since individuals of all races were enslaved in the New World, racism arose from forced labor and wasn't originally linked to the targeted discrimination of African Americans. Historically, the first group subjected to harsh enslavement was the Indian population. For example, Spanish explorers used Indian labor in their colonies to enforce Christian conversion, mandating slave labor for those who resisted (Williams 8). Similarly, Great Britain and France supported slavery in their colonies, not due to racial biases but as a punitive measure against indigenous communities. However, African Americans eventually became a more significant part of the slave trade due to economic advantages, normalizing Negro slavery (Williams 21). Consequently, racism and racial discrimination developed, but the primary reason for replacing other enslaved people with African Americans was economic, not racial. Therefore, the link between slavery and racism is rooted in the economic-driven use of African Americans as slaves, which led to the development of negative racial stereotypes. In essence, slavery did not start because of racism; people from various races and ethnic groups were involved in the slave trade. However, once the economic benefits of enslaving African Americans were recognized, racial prejudices emerged, giving rise to racism.",
    "Culture encompasses the full spectrum of social norms, behaviors, and customs that uniquely characterize a society and set it apart from others globally. Naturally, some cultures exhibit shared traits, leading to the formation of cultural clusters. Concurrently, leadership is a personality characteristic that transcends national borders, although it does not mean that all individuals in positions of power exhibit uniform behavior. Leaders are invariably influenced by the cultural norms of their respective societies. Noteworthy differences manifest in how various cultural clusters perceive concepts such as time. For instance, Middle Eastern cultures are often contrasted with Western ones, particularly American culture. As Beehner notes, while \"most Middle Eastern nations are past-oriented\" and deeply rooted in tradition, \"many Americans believe they can control the future and embrace change for its own sake\" (72). A prominent example of a leader who emphasized the significance of change is Barack Obama. \n\nThe differences in leadership behavior extend beyond just perceptions of the future. Research by Crede et al. provides insights into the cultural variances affecting transformational leadership. One intriguing discovery from their study shows that \"transformational leadership has stronger correlations with subordinate performance in cultures with lower levels of gender egalitarianism values\" (Crede et al. 23). This finding suggests that in more traditional cultures, leaders are potentially more effective in transformational roles. Thus, culture undoubtedly exerts a profound influence on the conduct of leaders, indicating that the concept of culture should acknowledge its impact on leadership behaviors. Besides distinguishing a particular social group, culture highlights the potential for change driven by authoritative figures. These leaders play a crucial role in making pivotal decisions within society.",
    "Culture is a key factor that affects all aspects of human life. It shapes how people act, work, and interact daily. Roseberry defines culture as a socially created and socially important part of the environment where all activities happen. This means that major institutions and phenomena like power, economy, and history are part of culture. As a way of life, culture impacts these areas and sets the stage for important processes in them. Essentially, cultural traits influence decisions in politics and historical events throughout a society’s development. Business practices and economic approaches also depend on the values and views of a particular culture. Understanding history and politics helps in grasping the complex layers of culture. \n\nRoseberry also believes culture is socially built, so many cultures share the same values and visions. For instance, my culture is similar to that of my friends and community because we live in the same context and have similar approaches. However, globally, my beliefs and views differ from those of people in other regions, which guides their decisions and actions differently. This difference is due to the social nature and unique character of culture. It includes shared perspectives and attitudes within similar communities and shapes mentalities and visions. Hence, culture is a social construct that influences social interactions and essential institutions crucial for daily life.",
    "Forming states is a complex process involving various strategies of power, particularly through cultural influence. Social agents play a key role in forming alliances and establishing dominance, which helps shape regions like Western Europe, China, the Islamic World, and India.\n\nA social strategy of power involves how creators of mass media influence public opinion and act as agents of social change, thereby affecting state formation. Gledhill highlights that the main difference between state and stateless societies is the centralization of power. Centralized power corresponds with equality and citizenship, while decentralized power leads to inequality and lack of citizenship.\n\nTo understand state emergence in these regions, one must consider the cultural strategies of power rather than just focusing on European principles. Social influence is crucial as social agents help shape public opinion and contribute to the formation of states. Thus, there's a clear connection between the development of states in Europe, China, the Islamic World, and India and the power strategies employed by social authorities.",
    "The modification of personal computers necessitated the development of more complex hardware and software, including advancements in buses—the communication channels between internal components and peripheral devices. These buses have become more sophisticated, with three primary types identified: address, control, and data buses (Farret et al., 2017). The data bus, for instance, is crucial for data exchange between the Central Processing Unit (CPU) and peripherals (Farret et al., 2017). The address bus helps the CPU locate specific information in memory, while the control bus manages data processing.\n\nData buses are represented in multiples of two and are currently available in five types: 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 (Farret et al., 2017). These numbers indicate the number of bits that can be transmitted simultaneously, with higher values allowing for greater information processing capacity. The number of parallel lines in a processor determines the volume of electrical signals exchanged between the CPU and peripherals. Modern operating systems typically use 32-bit and 64-bit microprocessors. A 32-bit data bus has thirty-two parallel lines between components, while a 64-bit data bus has sixty-four lines, effectively doubling the data exchange capacity (Farret et al., 2017).\n\nThus, the primary distinction between these data buses lies in their data processing speed. The performance of older bus versions similarly depends on the number of parallel copper wires connecting the CPU to other internal parts. While all these buses share the fundamental function of data interchange, their operation speeds vary due to structural differences.",
    "Data science is a fascinating field that delves into the entire journey of digital data—from its emergence to its application across various domains of knowledge. It’s about diving deep into vast oceans of information, aiming to unearth practical insights. Os Keyes offers a thought-provoking twist: She suggests that data science essentially quantifies humanity, reducing our rich, complex lives to mere numbers.\n\nThis controversial perspective challenges the conventional view of data science. Keyes's argument hints at a world where everything can be measured, as the discipline zeroes in on objects and analyses that can be counted. In her eyes, data science systems are voracious, seeking to consume every aspect of life—ours included—and break it down into quantifiable elements. \n\nIn the realm of decision-making, this approach could strip away the human touch, turning us into variables in an algorithm. Consider standardized tests, for example. These tests, often framed by rigid algorithms, force individuals into narrow pathways—usually multiple-choice questions with fixed answers. One wrong move can set a person back irrevocably, promoting a culture where only flawless data is welcomed, and human error becomes intolerable. Consequently, people grow accustomed to giving 'correct' answers and fear stepping outside the algorithm's approval zone.\n\nYet, the flip side of the coin reveals the immense value of data science in error-sensitive sectors. Take healthcare, where precision can be a matter of life and death. Healthcare professionals increasingly rely on sophisticated electronic systems that guide them in selecting the right treatments and dosages. Human errors, like overlooking a drug’s expiration date, are significantly minimized as these intelligent systems promptly suggest the optimal pharmaceutical options, ensuring they’re safe for use.\n\nIn essence, while data science can feel cold and calculating, particularly through Keyes's lens, it also harbors the power to enhance our lives by minimizing mistakes and driving better outcomes, especially in critical fields.",
    "Gerai’s account of the Dayak community offers a refreshingly utopian perspective on sex and gender, starkly contrasting with Western norms. In Western societies, gender distinctions often result in one being elevated at the other's expense. Conversely, the Dayak acknowledge these differences as mutually beneficial. Instead of creating divisions, they view male strength and female persistence as complementary traits that enhance both societal wellbeing and personal relationships. This near-egalitarian approach is remarkable and comforting, especially when compared to the severe gender clashes in most industrialized societies.\n\nGerai notes that Western cultures commonly associate male strength with aggression, reflecting societal values rather than inherent traits. Western emphasis on hypermasculinity and aggression defines masculinity through physical dominance and abusive actions, such as sexual domination and assault. This cultural framework starkly contrasts the egalitarian harmony observed in the Dayak community.\n\nThe notion that rape is a cultural rather than a biological phenomenon also becomes apparent. Western societies often frame rape through a lens that reinforces male dominance and female victimhood. Such a perspective attributes passive femininity to victims and prescriptive masculinity to perpetrators, reinforcing harmful stereotypes. A UK study, for instance, found that the term \"victim\" is often associated with passive femininity, reflecting deeper societal biases. This feminization hypothesis highlights how rape victims, mostly women but also men, are burdened with stereotypical feminine traits, leading to greater judgment and stigmatization.\n\nIn summary, the Dayak’s culturally ingrained egalitarianism offers a stark, hopeful contrast to the Western fixation on gender conflicts and the negative attributes tied to sexual violence. It underscores the crucial role societal values play in shaping gender dynamics and responses to such issues.",
    "Thrombosis of the lower extremities' veins can lead to blood clots forming in cavities, disrupting normal blood flow. Over time, these clots can block the venous lumen and even dislodge, traveling to the heart, lungs, and other critical organs (Dalen, 2016). Unfortunately, detecting the initial symptoms of leg vessel thrombosis is often challenging. However, signs of vascular disease include skin discoloration and swelling at the clot site. As thrombosis progresses, acute pain and heaviness in the legs emerge, driven by venous congestion below the thrombosis site. The primary causes are blood clotting and vein wall damage (Thachil & Bagot, 2018). Long journeys and old age increase the risk of complications, and certain medications may heighten blood clotting, so it’s crucial to inquire about the patient's medication history for an accurate diagnosis.\n\nDiagnosing thrombosis precisely involves methods like duplex scanning, radiopaque phlebography, MRI, or CT. Combining these techniques offers the most accurate assessment of the disease's severity and nature, allowing the doctor to prescribe appropriate treatment. This could involve heparin injections and anticoagulant capsules. If these treatments are ineffective, thrombolysis may be necessary to dissolve the clots. In the worst cases, surgery is required, though it’s a last resort due to potential risks, especially in older patients. Utilizing all other methods before resorting to surgery is essential. This approach not only helps treat thrombosis but can also save the patient's life.",
    "For centuries, Western scholarship has misunderstood and misrepresented African culture, often viewing its rich traditions through the narrow scope of colonization. This has led to the appropriation and devaluation of African philosophical ideas, converting intrinsic aspects of people's identities into marketable commodities. In their writings, p’Bitek and Marimba explore themes such as culture, spirituality, and philosophy, highlighting how Western perspectives have reshaped their portrayal without a true grasp of their essence. This commodification has blurred the lines between culture, philosophy, religion, and spirituality for African societies, undermining their ability to self-identify.\n\nAfrican culture naturally entwines with philosophy and spirituality, rejecting the European tendency to compartmentalize life into distinct, observable segments. p’Bitek poignantly observes this shift, noting that culture transforms from \"the way of life of a people\" into \"something that is bought and sold\" (What is Culture? 14). Consequently, younger Africans, particularly those in the Western world, often perceive their heritage as tidbits of memorabilia rather than integral parts of daily existence. Concurrently, they are exposed to Western religions that espouse poverty and individualism (p’Bitek, Man Born Unfree 21). Ani points out that African-Americans experience a painful disconnection, feeling estranged from both their African roots and European identity (49). This detachment erodes communal and generational bonds.\n\nThe works discussed illustrate the fundamental clashes between African and European ideologies, with the latter predominating and distorting the presentation of the former. Consequently, generations become alienated from their cultural heritage, viewing it through a skewed lens of commodification. African culture intrinsically integrates philosophy, spirituality, and an appreciation for life's richness, yet it is being reduced to a tourist spectacle, forcing its people to adopt an external perspective that severs their deep-rooted connection to history and nature.",
    "In a specific sense, the \"zero-sum story\" refers to the belief that racial groups are in competition, where progress for one group is perceived as a threat to the resources and status of another (McGhee). This narrative is a prevalent paradigm in conservative media and has persisted in various forms over the years. The detrimental effects of the \"zero-sum\" mindset in the United States are extensive and multifaceted. This perspective has resulted in additional economic, political, and social costs for all American citizens. One notable example highlighted by McGhee is the history of public swimming pools in cities across the US. In the early 20th century, many US cities featured large public swimming pools, which were predominantly \"white only.\" Following numerous drowning incidents, municipalities were instructed to make these pools accessible to everyone, regardless of race. This caused backlash from white residents, leading cities to close or privatize these public facilities rather than allow integrated use. This demonstrates how the \"zero-sum\" mindset led to the destruction of public goods and increased costs for the entire population. Another negative example provided by McGhee is political: many white people ceased advocating for social policies related to jobs and benefits once the Black community began supporting these initiatives. Consequently, social justice and benefits for the whole country diminished, as proponents of the “zero-sum” mindset opposed policies that could benefit other races. McGhee's arguments appear reasonable and justifiable to me—they accurately depict the historical and current realities in the United States. My agreement is rooted in the factual and statistical evidence supporting her stance, making it difficult to dispute that the US faces significant social and economic challenges due to racism.",
    "Type 1 diabetes happens when the body's immune system destroys pancreatic beta cells, especially in those who are genetically prone. This damage, called insulitis, takes months or years to develop and causes low insulin levels. Without enough insulin, the body can't use glucose properly, prompting the release of hormones like glucagon, adrenaline, cortisol, and growth hormone. These hormones, especially glucagon, cause the liver to produce more glucose, leading to high blood sugar and metabolic acidosis.\n\nType 2 diabetes is the most common endocrine disorder, caused by insulin resistance, where the body's cells don't respond well to insulin. This results in blood glucose not being absorbed well and disrupts liver glycogen storage. \n\nPeople with diabetes should follow a structured meal plan and take their medications with meals. For type 1 diabetes, a recommended diet includes carbohydrates from fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and skim milk. For type 2 diabetes, the diet should include complex carbohydrates like brown rice, whole wheat, fruits, vegetables, and beans. Both types should avoid simple carbohydrates like sugar, pasta, white bread, and pastries. \n\nFor type 1 diabetes, insulin Degludec (Tresiba) is necessary along with diet to prevent hypoglycemia in adults. An oral drug, Zynquista, can also be combined with insulin. \n\nFor type 2 diabetes, if diet, weight loss, exercise, and medications don't control blood sugar, insulin may be needed. Insulin Degludec and the oral drug Metformin are also used in this case.",
    "The healthcare industry pays significant attention to patient education, especially for minority groups. McCurley et al. (2017) show that Hispanic individuals improve diabetes prevention through individual and group face-to-face sessions. These positive outcomes are likely because such interventions allow patients to ask questions and realize they are not alone, boosting morale and motivation for preventive health measures. This suggests that face-to-face interventions could be beneficial for my practicum project on improving care access for African Americans with heart failure. However, focusing solely on cultural backgrounds shouldn't overlook broader contexts. Cajiita et al. (2017) found that mobile technology (mHealth) enhances healthcare knowledge, particularly in a study including 25% African Americans. Given that many people spend considerable time online, mHealth can be as effective as face-to-face interventions. Therefore, combining mobile technologies and face-to-face sessions might yield the best results.",
    "To reduce the risk of heart disease, cancer, and diabetes, individuals must stick to strict routines, particularly regarding their diet. The American Heart Association advises those aiming to prevent heart disease to eat foods without added sugars, high sodium levels, and saturated and trans fats. Recommended foods include whole grains, vegetables (including frozen and canned), nuts, seeds, and lean meats such as chicken and beef. The American Cancer Society recommends consuming more fruits and vegetables, especially dark green and orange varieties, for their cancer prevention benefits. They also advise eating high-fiber foods like legumes and whole grains while avoiding red meats and added sugars. The American Diabetes Association suggests eating non-starchy vegetables, like broccoli, carrots, and cauliflower, making up half of each meal, and emphasizes the intake of protein-rich foods like beans, hummus, and lentils, as well as fruits and healthy fats.\n\nThe dietary guidelines for preventing these conditions are quite similar. All organizations agree on the importance of avoiding added sugars and saturated and trans fats. They also highlight the need for consuming more fruits, vegetables, and chicken. While red meat is advised against for cancer prevention, it is more permissible for those managing heart disease and diabetes. Additionally, diabetes patients should prioritize non-starchy vegetables more than individuals with the other conditions. Lastly, those aiming to prevent heart disease must be particularly cautious about their fat intake.",
    "Watching the news or reading the latest Forbes article, you might notice the terms “business” and “economics” used interchangeably, leading to curiosity about their differences. Business and economics are interrelated fields that complement each other, involving the creation, distribution, and sale of products and services. Both domains encompass shared subtopics, such as enterprises, marketing, finance, manufacturing, and banking, and are social sciences focused on financial measurement and analysis. They examine market influences and make both short- and long-term projections, scrutinizing the inner workings of various industries. Additionally, both address challenges facing the nation, its citizens, the government, and private enterprises (Vaidya).\n\nHowever, notable differences exist between economics and business, rooted in their conceptual purposes. Economics seeks to understand human behavior and its impact on broader economic factors of entire nations. Conversely, business studies the exchange of goods and money, covering all aspects from production to final sale, and examines how specific enterprises manage these processes. It could be argued that business is a subset of economics since it involves human behavior in the exchange of goods (Casson).\n\nKey distinctions lie in their conceptual frameworks: economics deals with broad theories and elements of the economy, such as supply and demand, interest rates, and international trade, which influence business operations. However, business focuses on wealth creation within the economic context, generally applying practical theories. Economics aims to optimize societal welfare, whereas business centers on shareholder interests. They confront different issues: economics addresses poverty, unemployment, taxation, and federal expenditures, while business focuses on product positioning, differentiation, marketing, profitability, and performance at individual or industry levels (Gitman et al.).\n\nWhile business and economics share many similarities, their conceptual and practical differences distinguish them as separate sciences.",
    "Exploring the distinct approaches of doctors and nurses in patient care can be a compelling topic, particularly when the differences are highlighted. Medical practice often focuses on a patient's physiological status and relies on quantitative research for objective outcomes. In contrast, nursing practice incorporates both physiological and psychological responses, employing a mixed-methods approach that includes both data and patient opinions. This distinction is evident in PICOT-based research, where medicine emphasizes lab results and nursing focuses on symptom assessment.\n\nA study comparing nursing and medical practices can illuminate the accuracy of their respective diagnostic approaches. While both fields aim for effective patient outcomes, their methodologies differ. For example, nursing practices might prioritize preventing certain injuries and providing personalized, patient-centered care, highlighting the critical role of decision-making in nursing (Nibbelink & Brewer, 2018). A PICOT question on specialized care for fall prevention versus treatment could effectively showcase nursing’s personalized care approach, differentiating it from traditional medical practices.",

    "The case in question, Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S., played a crucial role in establishing measures to prevent discrimination in the workplace. It primarily focused on diversity concerning sex and age, a combination that frequently raises public concern (King, 2021). Gerald Bostock's case proved instrumental in defining appropriate employment practices in this context. The lawsuit filed by Bostock centered on his wrongful termination from a company where he otherwise had a positive reputation. This dismissal occurred due to his interest in a gay softball league, which he mentioned at work, thus contravening Title VII provisions (Mallory et al., 2020). Bostock invoked this section of the Civil Rights Act to file his lawsuit, but the district court initially dismissed it, citing a misinterpretation of the law (“Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S.,” 2019). However, Bostock's appeal, which argued for the inclusion of sexual discrimination, succeeded because he supported his case with contradictory statements from Massachusetts law, Chapter 151B (“Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S.,” 2019). Consequently, the interpretation of legal provisions regulating such cases was updated. In summary, this landmark court case, centered on employment law and discrimination, was pivotal in making necessary adjustments. The previous scope of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act did not explicitly cover sex and age discrimination. Bostock's victory filled this gap, resulting in a legal change that helps ensure workplace equality in terms of diversity.",
    "In today's digital age, misinformation comes in various forms, from obvious fake articles to more cunning forms of deceit. People often make critical life decisions based on the news they consume, such as choosing a candidate in elections or deciding on medical treatments when ill. Therefore, reliable news is essential. When individuals struggle to differentiate between genuine and fake news, important social and political issues can become confused and misinterpreted. Many pieces of false information are deliberately crafted to ignite and escalate societal conflicts. Thus, exercising critical thinking is crucial during social media interactions, including researching topics, writing comments, and sharing posts. \n\nFake news often aims to provoke strong emotional reactions such as fear or anger, making critical thinking and research indispensable. To combat misinformation, it's important to employ several strategies: Firstly, verify the source of the news or information. Fake news websites often mimic legitimate news sites but fail to provide credible content across various topics. If the website seems dubious, check the “About” page for a detailed description of the organization. Secondly, investigate the author's credentials. Assess their reliability by examining their reputation and expertise in the relevant field. The author's motives could play a significant role in spreading falsehoods. Thirdly, fact-checking is vital as credible news reports typically contain multiple pieces of verifiable information, such as data, statistics, and expert quotations. If such details are absent, question why. Reports with inaccurate information may also have incorrect dates or timelines, so always check the article’s publication date for consistency.",
    "Bananas are a globally popular fruit with numerous health benefits. They are especially important in low-income, food-insecure countries, serving both as a staple for household food security and as a cash crop. Bananas are a major export for many agricultural nations and are the largest fruit crop in Africa, Asia, and Latin America by production and trade (MacKinnon & Cumbers, 2019). Central and South America, along with the Philippines, supply over 90% of banana exports. Major importers include the EU, USA, China, Russia, and Japan.\n\nGlobal banana production is estimated at 130 million tons annually, with 87% consumed locally by farmers or sold in local markets. Sub-Saharan Africa produces about a third of the world's bananas, meeting over 25% of the dietary energy needs for more than 100 million people, mainly in East Africa (MacKinnon & Cumbers, 2019). \n\nTrade growth is driven by increased supply from countries like Ecuador and the Philippines and rising import demand from markets such as China and the EU (MacKinnon & Cumbers, 2019). Large retail chains now purchase bananas directly from growers, affecting the traditional fruit corporations' roles. This shift has led to conflicts of interest in the supply chain, often resulting in poor wages and working conditions for small farmers and plantation workers.\n\nA significant issue in large-scale banana production is its environmental impact and the health and safety of workers and local populations, due to harsh irrigation and disease control techniques. \n\nReferences:\nMacKinnon, D., & Cumbers, A.

    "Making Budgetary Control Effective\n\nTo make budgetary control effective, it's important to have a strong organizational structure. Establishing specific committees, such as a finance committee and a budget director, can really help. It's also key to integrate budget planning smoothly to prevent any hold-ups. Make sure individual budgets are aligned with each other for harmony. Regular reviews of budgets are essential to ensure they don’t become a blank check for spending the entire authorized amount when unnecessary. As Dauda (2019) wisely noted, “business organizations of all types must engage in financial planning at whatever level to ensure judicious deployment of resources for achieving organizational goals.” \n\nIt’s also crucial to reward employees for good performance according to the budget, while addressing any issues with staff that may not be performing up to standards. \n\nBehavioral Aspects of Budgetary Control\n\nBudgetary control is a vital tool for evaluating performance, even though results take some time to materialize. Those managing fiscal control need to be highly knowledgeable and skilled. Employees often adjust their working habits and relationships based on budgets, which can sometimes cause resistance to change. That’s why getting support from top leadership when creating each budget is essential. Clearly outlining and formally distributing each employee’s duties helps everyone understand their roles, which is crucial for effective budget management.\n\nThe success of a financial management program relies heavily on the organization’s clearly defined objectives. Therefore, when setting targets, management should be thorough and deliberate to ensure the goals are clear and achievable.",
    "Gendered behavior reflects how individuals express their gender identity through various stages of their lives. This concept encompasses the way people act according to societal expectations of being male or female (Au & Rudolfsdottir, 2021). Growing up, one notable gendered behavior imparted to me was the belief that cooking was primarily a woman's duty within the household. As a result, I learned to prepare meals from a young age, unlike most of my male relatives. This idea was reinforced by popular media, which often portrayed women as the main cooks in the family.\n\nAnother profound gender role that I readily embraced during my formative years was the notion that women are natural caregivers. This role painted women as compassionate and empathetic individuals who prioritize the well-being of others both at home and within society. Women were seen as embodying warmth, nurturing, and care, qualities that naturally extended to professions like nursing and teaching. This perspective of women as inherently more humane and caring resonated deeply with me. It underscored the critical roles women play in maintaining societal harmony and alleviating suffering. Embracing this role made me proud, as it highlighted women's pivotal contributions in combating oppression, suffering, and cruelty from an early age.\n\nHowever, this perceived nobility of the caregiving role came with unintended consequences, particularly concerning employment opportunities. Many professions, such as piloting, engineering, and high-ranking medical positions, were often deemed unsuitable for women, who were expected to pursue careers in nursing and teaching instead (Samidha, 2019). Such societal constraints limited women's potential and reinforced stereotypes, even leading patients to routinely assume female healthcare providers were nurses rather than doctors. This dynamic created conflicts and obstacles when women like myself considered diverse career paths.\n\nIn essence, while the idea of women as nurturing and caring beings placed them on a pedestal, it also imposed limitations. It forced many to confront difficult career choices and challenges rooted in deep-seated gender biases.",
    "Historical events and time periods often have specific names, like the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, and the Stone Age. These names help us tell one era from another. One major example is the Industrial Revolution, also known as industrialization. This was a pivotal moment in history that brought huge technological and social changes. It happened really fast, kicking off and wrapping up in under 100 years. The term “revolution” highlights just how rapid and transformative this period was.\n\nJust like any revolution, the Industrial Revolution had a big impact on people’s lives. It changed the way we work and think about the economy, labor, and the world around us, bringing both benefits and challenges. For entrepreneurs and those starting businesses, industrialization offered new avenues for income by shifting focus from manual labor to machine-driven production. This change led to large-scale manufacturing and new types of production.\n\nOn the flip side, workers felt the impact too. As complex machinery became more common, there was less demand for unskilled labor, pushing people to seek higher education and proficiency. Many lost their jobs, but others found new job opportunities by moving to cities. Industrialization spurred urban development, making cities central hubs for human interaction.\n\nOn a global scale, the ability to mass-produce goods allowed countries to build larger economies, expand trade, and forge deeper relationships with their neighbors. The age of industrialization had its share of ups and downs, but its significance is undeniable. It's the foundation of the society we know today.",
    "The Miranda warning, or Miranda rights, is a formal notification given to someone being arrested in the United States, informing them of their fundamental civil rights. This includes the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney. These rights are foundational to the U.S. legal system, ensuring fair treatment and an unbiased investigation. The mandatory nature of this warning is crucial, as it protects the detainee's inherent rights, which are guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution. Denying these rights would constitute a significant legal violation. Rogers and Drogin (2019) note that not all individuals are automatically aware of these rights. Additionally, if an officer fails to provide this notification, any testimony given by the defendant may be considered inadmissible in court due to potential coercion. Thus, Miranda warnings serve to protect both defendants and prosecutors.\n\nHowever, there are arguments about the necessity of Miranda warnings in certain situations. For instance, in the arrest of a dangerous criminal or someone posing a major terrorist threat, issuing a Miranda warning may be seen as unnecessary. In these urgent scenarios, immediate action is required to neutralize the threat before proceeding with legal protocols. In such cases, delaying the Miranda warning until public safety is ensured may be contextually appropriate, as immediate threats to lives take precedence over legal formalities (Rogers & Drogin, 2019). Despite this, Miranda warnings should not be completely disregarded, as they are essential for a transparent trial. Therefore, if not given at the moment of arrest, Miranda rights should be communicated once the situation is secure and before initiating formal legal proceedings.",
    "Doctors are supposed to stick to ethical standards like being loyal to their patients and respecting their choices. But the medical field also takes into account philosophical, religious, and cultural views. Physician-assisted suicide involves a doctor helping a patient end their life. The doctor provides all the necessary info and means for the patient, but this kind of cooperation isn't always seen as ethical. If euthanasia is done wrong, it could seriously harm the patient, possibly ruining their way of life. Even if patients with incurable illnesses want to die, doctors are often not allowed to help because it goes against the moral rule of not taking another person’s life.\n\nDoctor-assisted suicide goes against the core idea of the profession, which is to help people. Doctors are healers, and assisting in suicide doesn't fit that role, as it could put many patients at risk. This conflict ties back to the Hippocratic Oath doctors take, which includes a promise to do no harm. So, helping a patient die can be seen as intentionally causing harm. It might also reduce trust between patients and doctors since taking a life can't be ethically justified. From a religious standpoint, aiding a patient in dying breaks the commandment not to kill. Plus, society generally views killing as morally wrong. Instead of aiding in death, doctors can help manage a patient's pain with the available treatments, while death is something that can't be undone.",
    "The project aims to investigate the factors influencing people's identification of their sexual orientation and the reasons behind it. Some individuals believe that sexuality is a matter of personal choice, while others assert that one's environment cannot dictate the gender they are attracted to. The latter group argues that sexuality is biologically determined and is an inherent aspect of one's identity, which should be protected by the government (Sheldon et al., 2017). To delve into people’s viewpoints on this issue, the project poses the research question: Does the environment affect people’s sexual orientation? \n\nUtilizing the GSS database, the research identifies key dependent and independent variables. The dependent variable is 'sexort,' representing the respondent's sexual orientation, with the related question being: \"Which of the following best describes you?\" This variable was selected because it helps ascertain the environment surrounding the respondent. The independent variable is 'sexbirth,' which stands for the sex assigned at birth, with the question: \"What sex were you assigned at birth (for example, on your birth certificate)?” This variable was chosen to identify respondents’ sexuality and target homosexual individuals for the research.\n\nThere is a crucial correlation between these two variables that can enhance the project’s investigation. An individual's sexual identification significantly impacts their life experiences. For instance, the environments encountered by males and females can differ markedly. Consequently, such environmental differences can influence how individuals identify their sexual orientation.",
    "A key responsibility of a business leader is to choose the most effective course of action from the available options during decision-making. This requires a deep understanding of the company's business environment. When venturing into the market with products for consumer purchase, experts frequently rely on the supply and demand theory. This theory helps decode customer purchasing habits and guides managers in market strategizing accordingly. For example, low product demand indicates the need to reduce supply, while high demand suggests ramping up production. Additionally, analyzing supply and demand assists in pricing strategies: high demand supports price increases while maintaining customer interest, whereas low demand necessitates affordable pricing to avoid losses.\n\nVarious strategies can leverage the supply and demand model effectively. Consider De Beers, a diamond jewelry company. Although their vaults are brimming with diamonds, they cleverly maintain high prices by restricting supply, ensuring diamonds remain a coveted luxury that people are willing to pay for as a status symbol. Zappos offers another example. Initially, the idea of selling shoes online without a try-on option seemed flawed, yet they thrived by managing supply adeptly—with a wide selection, stellar customer service, and a friendly return policy, encouraging repeat customers. Apple, the tech market titan, masterfully builds demand by creating anticipation around new releases, making customers feel part of something greater than just another gadget launch.\n\nIn summary, the supply and demand theory can be a powerful market navigation tool, provided it is used to the product's benefit.",
    "The influence of social networks is growing, overshadowing traditional media. Twitter, in particular, has become a powerful tool for accessing current information and engaging in various debates. However, the impact of tweets can vary. This paper examines a tweet by Australian politician Bill Shorten regarding the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS). In his message, Shorten celebrates a joyful event but also expresses regret over the current policy that limits NDIS activities. The tweet is both informative and a grievance. Shorten mentions that a girl received assistance through NDIS funding but only after the situation received public attention. He criticizes the Australian government's current policy, which restricts NDIS's ability to help people. Although the tweet contains both negative and positive messages, it can have a beneficial impact. The criticism from an influential politician can highlight the issue and call for action from society and the government.\n\nSeveral indicators of the tweet's impact are evident. According to Casero-Ripollés (2020), activity, popularity, and authority are key signs of influence. Shorten’s tweet received 209 retweets, 50 comments, and 858 likes – significant engagement for a poorly discussed topic. However, given Australia's population, such numbers are relatively small. Assessing authority, Shorten, as a politician, is knowledgeable and concerned about the topic, providing a credible and authoritative opinion. Thus, while the tweet may spark discussion about NDIS activities, its influence may not extend to a national level.",
    "An increasing number of physicians are encountering victims of human trafficking, often without recognizing them as such. Todres (2017) highlighted a case in which Dr. W was asked to screen women employed by a particular firm for sexually transmitted infections. Although the American Medical Association's Code of Medical Ethics (2011) emphasizes the importance of safeguarding patient confidentiality—including physical, informational, decisional, and associational privacy—Dr. W faced a dilemma. She was requested not to maintain patient records to prevent the potential arrest of these women. Dr. W realized that foregoing record-keeping could deny these employees access to proper healthcare and potentially lead to further spread of STIs.\n\nThis scenario encompasses various issues, including criminal law, ethical considerations, human rights, and service provider regulations. From a conspiracy law perspective, Dr. W's agreement to the firm's request might be seen as participating in a crime, as she was aware of the illegal activity and did not report it but instead assisted in its continuation. In terms of human rights, since prostitution is illegal in the U.S., and particularly if minors are involved, the situation would require mandatory reporting under law (Todres, 2016). Ethical considerations also necessitate breaching confidentiality to protect a child in such contexts.\n\nIn conclusion, decisions regarding encounters with human trafficking must be unequivocal. By aiding an enterprise engaged in human trafficking, a physician becomes partly responsible for crimes and the exploitation of women and children. Hence, adherence to legal frameworks and ethical guidelines mandates that such cases be reported.",
    "Feminist ethics is based on the belief that women's subordination is morally wrong and that women's moral experiences are just as important as men's. Vaughn (2019) outlines several practical aims of feminist ethics. Firstly, it critiques behaviors and attitudes that undermine women's rights. The main goal is to find morally justifiable ways to oppose such behaviors and practices. Ultimately, feminist ethics aims to envision morally just alternatives that promote female empowerment. The discussion of feminist ethics re-emerged in the late 1960s, gaining traction in both public and academic spheres as part of a broader revival of feminist questions. Initial academic feminist concepts addressed issues like abortion, equality, domestic work, sexual violence, and compulsory heterosexuality. The term 'feminist ethics,' however, didn’t become widely used until the late 1970s or early 1980s (Vaughn, 2019). Feminists argued that traditional ethics was predominantly male-biased and required thorough re-evaluation. Furthermore, feminism remains actively engaged in ethical debates and discussions. Vaughn (2019) notes that feminism is primarily a normative perspective, and feminists frequently challenge its definition. Feminist challenges include neglecting women's interests, ignoring women's concerns, denying women's moral agency, devaluing feminine ideals, and trivializing women's experiences. Feminist ethics has been stereotyped in various ways, such as prioritizing women's interests, viewing women as ethical authorities, valuing female over male perspectives, or deriving ethical principles directly from women's experiences. These stereotypes are widespread and inaccurate; feminist ethics is much broader and more inclusive than these misunderstandings suggest. In summary, contemporary feminists explore new ways of thinking about moral issues, focusing on their specific particularities and inherent shared values such as common humanity, fairness, and impartiality.",
    "Domestic violence and abuse involve one family member acting aggressively, either psychologically or physically, towards another. This aggression can manifest as beating, rape, screaming, or humiliation. Unfortunately, such incidents are quite common today. According to Huecker et al. (2021), 10 million Americans experience violence and abuse each year. Victims often feel depressed, helpless, and suffer from low self-esteem. Fear of the abuser may force victims to stay silent about their experiences.\n\nHowever, healthcare providers can identify signs of domestic violence, child abuse, or elder abuse. For example, if a woman shows up in the emergency room with bruises or fractures that don’t align with her explanation of slipping on a wet floor, a nurse might suspect she is being beaten by a partner. Victims often appear depressed and anxious, even if they try to hide these feelings (Lloyd, 2018). \n\nSigns of child abuse might include underweight children with no clear health explanation and those who are unusually fearful of adults. Children may also become severely startled by loud noises or sudden movements. For older adults, a nurse might suspect abuse if they have unexplained bruises, broken glasses, or misused walking aids, show depression, or fail to take their medications properly. An additional warning sign is a caregiver's refusal to leave the older person alone with medical staff. Though caregivers may sometimes be hesitant due to concerns about missing important health information, outright refusal to cooperate with medical personnel is concerning.\n\nNurses who recognize signs of abuse or domestic violence are required to report them to the appropriate authorities. In cases of child abuse, medical staff should contact social services via hotlines or written reports. Elder abuse should be reported to adult protective services agencies. For domestic violence cases, nurses should inform local law enforcement. Before doing so, nurses should discuss the situation with a physician or nurse practitioner and examine the patient without the potential abuser present.",
    "**Introduction**\n\nThe fashion industry stands as one of the most vibrant and ever-evolving sectors worldwide, fueled by the diverse and dynamic needs of its clients. Fashion is far more than mere attire; it is a personal statement, a symbol of social status, and a definition of one’s culture and individuality. Consequently, clients are perpetually in search of fashionable pieces that cater to these multifaceted needs, all while adhering to specific budgets.\n\nDespite the variety of fashionable clothes stocked by many stores, including retail giants like Zara and H&M, premade designs often fail to capture the true essence of clients’ personalities and individual needs. Although these brands invest substantial resources in identifying and meeting the unique demands of their clientele, their reach is not yet global, leaving many customers to settle for what is available.\n\nAddressing this gap between client desires and store offerings is essential for enhancing customer satisfaction. Enter Be-Unique, our innovative project designed to leverage technology and bring fashion services closer to the client. Our mission is to create an integrative platform that allows customers to digitally access and interact with their favorite clothing stores in ways never before possible. We aim to revolutionize the fashion industry by providing clients with the opportunity to present their unique designs for customization.\n\nStandardized clothing sizes from stores like Zara and H&M often fail to accommodate the breadth of body sizes and shapes, leaving some customers without perfectly fitting options.

    "The editing in the first episode of Money Heist matches its thrilling plot and rapid action. In the opening scene, the editing is quick as the character prepares to exit her vehicle, focusing on the items she picks up. The camera often zooms in on objects, guiding the viewer towards elements that will play essential roles in the story. For instance, a ringing phone is shown before it’s picked up. The show employs rapid editing with close-ups of items like guns and money, which reveal characters' motives or traits. \n\nDynamic close-ups on characters often use dolly shots to gradually reveal the background or move with the character. The camera continues moving as long as the characters do or as the entire room is revealed. When the characters stop, the editing pace quickens to match the speed of their conversations. During monologues, dolly shots maintain the tension, which is crucial for the series’ serious tone in life-or-death scenarios. Characters in close-ups are rarely centered; instead, shots are divided into vertical thirds, with characters positioned in the first or third section. \n\nHand-held shots are used consistently in scenes where characters feel insecure, aggressive, scared, or exposed. The camera also moves at the same speed as the characters when they walk. The contrast between steady dolly movements and hand-held \"shaky\" shots highlights the tension between action and interpersonal drama. By focusing on close-ups rather than wide shots, the editing maintains suspense, making tension the primary source of emotion.",
    "The Supreme Court has delivered a dynamic verdict affirming Static Control's allegations of Lanham Act violations through false advertising. At the heart of the case, the Supreme Court grappled with interpreting the statute's provisions, adhering to traditional principles of statutory interpretation (Campbell, 2020). Complicating matters was the misleading characterization of Static Control's claim as a prudential standing issue (Halbert & Ingulli, 2020). Lexmark’s arguments, based on the prudential standing from the Associated General Contractors case, collided with the robust statutory provisions that the Supreme Court meticulously evaluated.\n\nCrucially, violations under this statute harm the plaintiff's reputation, aligning perfectly within the statute's intended protection zone. The Court assumed that only plaintiffs whose interests are safeguarded by the invoked law could pursue action, as outlined in Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154 (Tavares, 2021). The Lanham Act’s purpose includes protecting individuals from unfair competition, traditionally associated with damaging a business’s reputation or sales.\n\nTherefore, in a false-advertising lawsuit, plaintiffs must demonstrate a commercial interest injury that lies within the zone of interest. The Supreme Court further presumed that the statutory cause of action is restricted to plaintiffs whose injuries are directly caused by the statute’s violation. Echoing the precedent set in Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corporation, 503 U.S. 258-270, claims for damages too far removed from the defendant’s illegal conduct are barred (Jones, 2019). However, under the Lanham Act, which exclusively addresses commercial injuries, the consumer deception requirement is not an insurmountable barrier.\n\nThe principles guiding this decision are more indicative than the direct-competitor test, the Sixth Circuit's reasonable interest test, or the multifactor balancing test proposed by Lexmark. These principles assert that Static Control’s claims fall squarely within the plaintiffs authorized to sue under §1125(a). Static Control convincingly argued that it suffered lost sales and reputational harm within the statute's protective zone due to Lexmark’s misrepresentations.\n\nIn sum, the Supreme Court has set a powerful precedent affirming Static Control’s right to challenge Lexmark's false advertising, underscoring the importance of statutory interpretation in protecting commercial interests.",
    "Marketing is a crucial element for every business, driving them to seek effective methods to attract new customers. However, not all marketing practices are fair or ethical, particularly when they target uninformed consumers—those who lack the psychological or mental capacity to make sound decisions. This group includes children, the elderly, and people with psychological conditions. It is unethical to target such consumers because it can lead to harmful outcomes for them.\n\nSeveral factors underscore the unethical nature of targeting uninformed consumers. Firstly, as defined earlier, these individuals lack the mental maturity to make informed choices, making them susceptible to marketing tactics that push them to buy unnecessary products. This amounts to manipulating vulnerable populations.\n\nSecondly, uninformed consumers find it difficult to detect deceitful practices by sellers. Businesses can exploit this by providing false information to drive consumer purchases. While some argue that targeting these consumers is acceptable, viewing them as new market segments that companies can profit from, it is essential to recognize their vulnerability. Therefore, they require a more considerate approach.\n\nIn summary, compelling arguments highlight why businesses should avoid marketing to children, the elderly, and individuals with psychological conditions. Although some contend that these groups represent viable market opportunities, targeting them is unethical. The primary reasoning is that uninformed consumers lack the psychological maturity to make reasonable decisions, making them susceptible to exploitation.",
    "In the 15th century, the European powers, led by the Spanish, began claiming the Caribbean following the conquest of the Aztec and Inca empires. This made it easier to invade Mexico and Peru. By the 17th century, the British and French joined in, establishing settlements on islands like Tortuga and Jamaica. Non-Hispanic privateers set up colonies and trading zones, exploiting gold and labor from African slaves. As Spanish power declined, other Europeans like England's Francis Drake increased their influence. Collaborative efforts among the French, British, and Dutch facilitated their conquest of the Caribbean. Agricultural activities, bolstered by the Atlantic slave trade, further strengthened European colonialism in the region.",
    "**Introduction**\n\n\"Back to the Future\" is a standout film from its era, evolving into a cult classic due to its captivating plot and meticulous attention to detail.

Zemeckis crafted a unique story that continues to fascinate audiences with its intricate details, character arcs, and shifting eras.",
    "The study found that using bibliometric analysis from integrative reviews and analytical studies can really help shape nurse-related and evidence-based policy changes. Basically, by using integrative reviews, we can develop new programs (Benton et al., 2020). The authors suggest that nurses can use this collective database of studies to empower themselves with evidence-based materials when making changes in universal health coverage. This is great news for working nurses, as they’ll have concise and reliable resources at their fingertips for advocating or implementing policy changes.\n\nI think nursing practice can be seriously improved with well-managed databases that use evidence-based research. These databases can highlight gaps in both broad issues and everyday medical practices in nursing (Houser, 2016). Plus, they give insight into specific fields like nurse education, elderly care, emergency care, and more.\n\nRight now, access to comprehensive and complete evidence-based information is limited for various reasons. To fix this, we need to cut down on bureaucratic hurdles and make better use of technology. Modern tech offers cheap and quick ways to share information, which would be a big help for nurses. Evidence-based research can uncover information gaps in nurse-specific practices that might otherwise go unnoticed. Making this knowledge accessible and coherent is crucial for promoting better nursing care and work quality.",

    "\"Fight Club\" explores the interconnectedness of masculinity and men's mental health. It portrays the destructive consequences of men's insecurities morphing into extreme masculinity, embodying toxic masculinity. The film reveals men dissatisfied with their roles, often having been raised by single mothers due to absent fathers, leading them to view themselves as \"a generation of men raised by women\" (Ta, 270). This absence of male role models contributes to an incomplete development of their masculinity, reflecting phallocentric ideas rooted in the image of castrated women who rear children to enter the symbolic order.\n\n\"Fight Club\" is a biting satire on self-discovery, self-nurture, and self-destruction. It challenges traditional notions of masculinity, suggesting that true manhood involves accepting traits often deemed associative, and occasionally embracing self-destruction and societal impact. The climactic scene where Jack's persona triumphs over Tyler on a skyscraper rooftop signifies that the good within a man can overcome destructive tendencies. Jack's journey, marked by self-sacrifice and accountability, offers a glimmer of hope, though the ending remains ambiguous.",
    "In the 19th century, Florence Nightingale, an exceptional Englishwoman, significantly influenced the development of nursing in Europe. Driven by a desire to help the poor and the sick, Florence sought opportunities to fulfill this mission. At that time, such acts of compassion were deemed unsuitable for a noblewoman. Despite the social pressures and the sacrifice of her personal relationships, Florence remained dedicated to her calling. Her values and unwavering commitment enabled her to become a pivotal figure in modern nursing, widely recognized for establishing its importance in society. Through determination, Florence joined the community of the sisters of Pastor F. Flender in Germany in 1851, where she received her nursing education. She made significant contributions not only to treating cholera and aiding in wars but also to leadership and reforming the nursing profession (Kim, 2020). Florence's selflessness and service to people set a standard for international compassion, and she successfully transformed the perception of nursing as a noble profession. Her impact is honored with a medal awarded to distinguished nurses for exceptional achievements. The international development of nursing owes much to the Red Cross Society. In October 1863, A. Dunant led the International Committee for Relief of the Wounded in convening a Geneva conference with representatives from 13 countries. This conference developed the charter and adopted the emblem of the International Red Cross Organization. In the United States, significant advancements in nursing occurred during the 19th and 20th centuries, facilitated by the establishment of the American Medical Association (AMA). In 1873, the first three nursing schools in the USA opened, modeled after Florence Nightingale's schools in London (Kim, 2020). Leaders like Florence were instrumental in the creation and growth of international humanitarian organizations.",
    "Diana Kendall thinks that how we see social classes today is shaped by the media. According to her, the media has made inequality seem normal in the U.S. through TV shows and newspaper stories that create and reinforce class stereotypes. Kendall says that while the media doesn't often talk about class directly, how they depict different classes affects our behavior. They show the upper class in a good light, as people to look up to—caring, generous, and even those with criminal records seem to have good lives. Conversely, the lower class is framed negatively—as homeless, poor, and usually ignored, only mentioned as statistics. This shapes our perception negatively because the media mainly focuses on the upper class and their issues, ignoring the lower class's problems. When they do show the lower class, it's often as lazy, diseased, criminal, or dealing with substance abuse, rather than considering factors like unemployment. This detachment means the poor and uneducated are overlooked, and their quality of life keeps getting worse since their needs aren't represented or addressed.",
    "Although the Monster murders people, it has good traits. Described as ugly and strong but inexperienced, it resembles a baby exploring the world. Despite its terrifying appearance, it does not intend to kill people. The creature seeks love and attention, which it can't find, leading to its emotional understanding of humans. The \"Gothic\" elements of the novel include supernatural motives, medieval architecture, and spiritual aspects, along with the pursuit of knowledge, the Monster, and humanity's moral decline. I enjoy this genre for its diverse perspectives on issues and its exploration of moral society through symbols like the Monster. Shelley’s husband believed societal rejection turns people evil, which I agree with; social treatment shapes intentions. One integral theme of the novel is loneliness. The Monster seeks social integration but faces disgust and hatred, leading to its turn to evil. Today's society often isolates those with different views, causing feelings of being lost and lonely.",
    "Absolutely! Here’s a more enthusiastic version of your text:\n\nThe concept of “gender roles” plays a fascinating role in our understanding of literature from various historical eras! During the Anglo-Saxon period, these roles were strikingly well-defined, and this is vividly showcased in the epic poem Beowulf. This genre of heroic poetry brims with thrilling tales of valiant and martial exploits! However, amid these daring adventures, the portrayal of women reveals itself in intriguing ways. Throughout Beowulf, women are depicted as properties for men's advantage and often serve to propel the male-driven narrative forward.\n\nYet, women also hold a subtly powerful presence, though their appearances are overshadowed by magnificent figures like Hrothgar, Beowulf, Wiglaf, and Unferth. For instance, the queen of the Swedes—nameless yet crucial—stands more as the king’s wife, Onela, highlighting the secondary identity assigned to women. Still, their roles, though scarce, are telling of the era's expectations!\n\nTake the evocative snippet, “…the Helming woman went on her rounds…treating the family and the collected troop,” where we see the quintessential role of a woman in 11th century society, caring and nurturing towards men (Heaney 620). Conversely, the tale of Queen Modthryth contrasts sharply against Queen Hygd; Modthryth is portrayed as independent and initially scorned by men. “Even a queen of great beauty must not overstep like that,” critics of her boldness declared (Beowulf 1940-1941), until she marries Offa and is lauded for her subsequent 'self-control'. This starkly underscores the societal belief that a woman's value was immensely tied to her marital status.\n\nIn Beowulf, these dynamic glimpses of gender roles provoke thought and enhance our appreciation of this riveting historical narrative!",
    "GMOs have become a regular part of our lives, but people still debate whether they're a good thing or not. Some folks think it's just not right to mess with genetic info and \"play God\" (MacKinnon & Fiala, 2017). Personally, I see GMOs more like any other technology—like machines, cars, or spaceships. GMOs, whether they're plants or animals, are part of my routine since I've eaten GMO-based foods. I'm not super worried about the long-term effects, unlike some people, because I see GMOs as just another form of selection that has been around for ages. People have always tried to grow more of the plants and animals they liked best.\n\nI think utilitarianism supports my view—this theory basically says something is ethical if it does the most good for the most people. GMOs can help tackle big issues like hunger since they're more resistant to tough conditions, which means more food can be produced. With so many people still starving, making more food available is a big plus. \n\nOn the flip side, some argue from a deontological perspective that it's wrong to mess with genetic codes because it's considered a divine area. They see GMOs as humans trying to act like God, which they believe is morally wrong. But, I'd argue that even according to the Bible, humans were told to take care of the planet, so using new tools like GMOs is just another way to fulfill that responsibility and look after all living things.",
    "The internationalization of companies has consistently caught the attention of management researchers. Over the past decade, the focus has shifted from evaluating the benefits and risks of internationalization to examining the strategies of international companies as they operate and grow. It's important to note that globalization functions as an institutional environment for global companies, characterized by high uncertainty, risks, and a dynamic nature. The primary incentive for company globalization and internationalization is the substantial expansion of market opportunities in both production and trade. This includes benefits such as market growth, economies of scale, learning, and the advantages of new locations.\n\nMany companies from developing countries like China, India, and Taiwan are actively involved in global value chains within high-tech sectors (Stallkamp & Schotter, 2019). However, this involvement brings a wide array of challenges specific to international companies in these regions. For instance, emerging markets often suffer from inadequate government oversight and regulation, leading to unethical and sometimes illegal business practices. A common issue is the exploitation of cheap local labor to reduce production costs for international businesses (Mashan, 2021). This practice is both morally and ethically reprehensible and can lead to severe consequences for the companies involved.\n\nDespite the benefits of international diversification, some firms choose not to expand internationally for several reasons. The most prevalent reason is a reluctance to move beyond their domestic market (Paul & Mas, 2019). This indicates either a fear of the risks associated with globalization or a strategic decision based solely on domestic market factors. Additionally, companies may avoid globalization due to awareness of the problems associated with foreign markets, including different consumer cultures, religions, and customs.\n\nIn summary, a global strategy offers significant advantages but also presents challenges that can deter companies from pursuing this approach.",
    "Gnomial Functions Inc. is on a mission to uncover the most dependable forecasting technique to predict sales over the next eighteen months. Over the past year and a half, sales have consistently climbed with minimal seasonal fluctuation. However, recent sales figures have shown a significant impact on future sales (Wisniewski, 2016). This indicates that Gnomial Functions Inc. should adopt the weighted moving average approach for their forecasts.\n\nThe weighted moving average technique incorporates four different weights to project the upcoming month's sales. These weights vary from 0.1 for the earliest months to 0.4 for the most recent months, reflecting the greater influence of more recent data on future sales. This method outperforms simple moving averages by providing more accurate predictions. \n\nBy tweaking the weights, management can sharpen their forecasts even further. For instance, the initial weights (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4) yielded a mean absolute deviation of 6.27 and a mean standard error of 47.29. In contrast, adjusting the weights to place more emphasis on recent sales (0, 0, 0.4, and 0.6) lowered the mean absolute deviation to 4.81 and the mean standard error to 27.28, showcasing a substantial improvement over the simple moving average.\n\nThus, Gnomial Functions Inc. should leverage the weighted moving average method to predict sales in the upcoming year. This method is not only simple and reliable but also adaptable, allowing the company to fine-tune the weights to capture evolving sales trends. In essence, adopting the weighted moving average will enable Gnomial Functions Inc. to make more precise sales forecasts in the year ahead.",
    "The modern world economy is incredibly diverse and complex, making it quite challenging to predict when a crisis might occur. Recessions can be stressful, causing our brains to kick into survival mode. In these situations, crisis intervention plays a crucial role by providing temporary emotional support to those affected by various forms of violence (Colford & Cavaiola, 2017).\n\nCurrently, there is a risk of an economic downturn that could impact everyone. Personally, I hope to avoid a recession because it could have a significant effect on my life. Crises tend to hit non-profit organizations hard, often leading to layoffs and forcing many people to rely on state assistance. Job scarcity and increasing poverty might even lead people to abandon their homes, struggling to afford essentials and pay rent.\n\nFrom a professional perspective, a recession affects the national economy as a whole, impacting not just individual enterprises but entire sectors. The cost of credit resources rises, and it becomes harder to secure them. Relationships with international partners might also deteriorate. Overall, a crisis is something we all want to avoid due to its far-reaching and unpredictable consequences.",
    "The YouTube video “GP Training in Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services” by GP Synergy highlights the pivotal role of Aboriginal Medical Services within the diverse community. These services provide essential, culturally sensitive, and high-quality care to marginalized and underserved populations, addressing their unique health concerns. The comprehensive healthcare services offered are designed to be affordable and accessible, supporting multiple facets of the patients' lives.\n\nThe culturally-sensitive approach taken by these medical facilities is key to tackling social determinants of health (SDOH), which include various aspects such as safe housing, education, job opportunities, and access to nutritious food. By addressing these factors, Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services aim to mitigate health disparities and inequities faced by Aboriginal patients.\n\nHealthcare professionals emphasize the significance of patient education, ensuring the community is aware of its health challenges and the importance of early prevention and management. The video particularly focuses on the issue of discrimination, recognizing its impact on patients who have experienced it within the healthcare system. This emphasizes the need for healthcare providers to deliver culturally sensitive care, despite the challenges it may present.\n\nContinuity of care is crucial, as feelings of discrimination or misunderstanding can deter patients from returning for further treatment. Nevertheless, healthcare workers find great reward in providing culturally sensitive care, as it fosters a sense of acceptance and understanding among patients. These professionals prioritize building meaningful relationships and often take on advocacy roles to support their patients within the healthcare system and broader society.\n\nIn summary, addressing the social determinants of health affecting the Aboriginal community is a demanding yet essential endeavor. It necessitates a dedicated focus on the unique needs of patients and thorough preparation from healthcare providers to deliver truly culturally-sensitive care.",
    "The cultural effects of Roman dominance over Greek-speaking regions are a fascinating topic that has garnered significant scholarly interest, particularly in recent years. The impact of the interaction between these two cultures varied across time and space, and it was most evident in areas where Roman communities had been established. These communities acted as vectors of influence, and their prolonged coexistence with Greeks facilitated the transmission of Roman elements into public life. \n\nOne such element was Roman names, whose dissemination can be attributed to networks of exchange and the identity of the individuals bearing these names. Rizakis (2019) distinguishes between two phenomena: the introduction of Greeks to the Roman naming system, which they then adapted to their own norms, and the adoption of Roman names by peregrine Greeks. Despite their differences, both phenomena exemplify the interaction between the two traditions, which gradually led to the emergence of a common onomastic culture. This form of acculturation increased in the 2nd century AD and displayed significant regional variability, with different cities and social classes receiving it differently.\n\nCivic elites played a crucial role in mediating these cultural transfers, aiming to extend their influence through naming practices both regionally and more broadly. Specifically, the use of _tria nomina_ during the imperial period, as noted by Rizakis (2019), became a symbol of pride, power, and prestige. Consequently, some names gained popularity as expressions of the shared culture and were adopted, albeit on a smaller scale, by the lower classes, eventually losing their original meanings. \n\nHowever, the dominance of Roman names as identifiers of free citizens of the Empire was short-lived. Rizakis (2019) states that by the end of the 3rd century AD, a new form of identity expression emerged—a single naming system that incorporated both Greek and Roman names. Initially used sparingly, this practice gained widespread acceptance after the reign of Constantine, particularly during late antiquity, becoming prevalent in almost all Roman provinces. This shift, driven by the advance of Christianity and the decline of the Roman Empire, could be seen as a return to the Greek naming tradition.",
    "Health promoters form a specialized workforce dedicated to enhancing health through various activities facilitated by health promotion organizations. Their key objectives include empowering individuals, promoting societal responsibility for health, and creating environments that foster skill development and community engagement (Nutbeam, 2019). Within the field of health promotion, experts from diverse health disciplines have identified the traits of effective collaboration and interdisciplinary approaches. The primary goal of interdisciplinary teams is to integrate varying perspectives on care, utilizing the expertise of different individuals and sectors. Effective health promotion hinges on intersectional collaboration among various health professionals and both public and private sectors (US Department of Health and Human Services, 2018). This diversity indicates that health is influenced by more than just medical services or the roles of nurses and physicians (Nutbeam, 2019). The extensive range of activities involved in health promotion requires a wide array of skills from multiple health professionals and industries. Including multidisciplinary specialists such as Nurse Practitioners (NPs), Social Workers (SWs), and Registered Nurses (RNs) within health promotion teams offers both immediate and long-term benefits. Nurse practitioners, with advanced education and training, are capable of treating various conditions and providing preventative care and health education (Pun, 2018). Social workers are trained to assist individuals and groups in skill development and problem-solving, addressing personal, interpersonal, or social issues (Nutbeam, 2019). Registered nurses assess healthcare needs to determine the most appropriate services, providers, and equipment for delivering patient care (Pun, 2018). Therefore, their expertise and approaches are crucial for the success of interdisciplinary teams focused on health promotion.",
    "As society evolved, so did the landscape of music, reflecting broader cultural shifts. Between 1959 and 1963, the music industry underwent a significant transformation, giving rise to two distinct markets (Covach and Flory 112). The first market catered to a new generation of teenagers who gravitated towards dance music (Covach and Flory 113). Simultaneously, a different segment emerged—composed of former rock and roll enthusiasts—who were drawn to folk music that resonated with social, political, and economic issues (Covach and Flory 113).\n\nFolk music had a longstanding tradition of addressing societal challenges, presenting itself as more community-oriented than the commercialized pop scene (Covach and Flory 118-119). Unlike pop stars, folk performers aimed to connect with their audiences, creating a sense of representation and solidarity (Covach and Flory 119). The accessibility of folk music, requiring only simple guitar chords, reinforced the idea that it was \"for the people and by the people\" (Covach and Flory 119). This sentiment reflected both the music and its associated ideologies, as performers and listeners alike addressed social issues through song.\n\nProminent figures and groups within the folk music scene played crucial roles in this movement. The Weavers, featuring traditional performers like Pete Seeger, stood out as a significant folk group in the United States (Covach and Flory 119). They focused on societal issues and embraced the simplicity of their music, finding a receptive audience among college students (Covach and Flory 119). By the early 1960s, The Kingston Trio had become the most prominent group to bring folk music into the mainstream pop market (Covach and Flory 119-120). Their blend of pop sensitivity and folk roots appealed to a broad audience, shaping the general perception of folk music (Covach and Flory 120-121).\n\nThroughout this period, numerous influential folk singers emerged, reinforcing the movement's commitment to addressing social concerns through music.",
    "The Roman Empire was predominantly polytheistic, meaning that its people recognized and worshipped multiple gods. They believed these deities played a vital role in shaping Roman civilization and influencing daily life (Bartsch, 2020). Due to Rome’s geographic location, its inhabitants frequently interacted with Greek populations who had extended their territories into the Italian peninsula and Sicily (Beard, 2015). Rome adopted many aspects of Greek culture, adapting them slightly to match their own needs. According to Polybius' interpretation, the Roman consuls embodied the monarchy aspect of the Roman government. In \"The Dream of Scipio,\" the stories of Manilus Hippomanes, Olivier de Noyen, and Julien Barneuve are interwoven with a philosophical theme that suggests people are responsible for their own redemption through understanding, rather than through actions or faith (Ruden, 2013).\n\nRome had two consuls, each commanding sections of the Roman army and possessing the power to convene meetings and present various initiatives to the Senate; they were elected annually. Roman citizenship was a complex concept that varied based on gender, family, and social status. Only men could attain full citizenship. A child born to a legal union between a citizen father and a citizen mother would be granted citizenship by descent (Beard, 2015).\n\nIn comparison, U.S. citizenship can be acquired by birth or through registration. People are generally considered U.S. citizens if they are born in the United States or born abroad to U.S. citizen parents. Children may also gain U.S. citizenship through the marriage of one or both parents.",
    "A Proposed Financial Plan to Support Mental Health Services for Healthcare Providers of Critical Patients:\n\n**Category/Subcategory/Expenditures ($):**\n- **Staff:**\n  - Mental Health Service Manager: 400,000\n  - Personal Consultants: 840,000\n  - Group Consultants: 650,000\n  - Technical Support Staff: 180,000\n- **Equipment:**\n  - Personal Laptops: 12,000\n  - Personal Mobile Phones: 5,000\n- **Services:**\n  - Telephone Service: 2,400\n  - Internet Service: 300\n- **Supplies:**\n  - Administrative Supplies: 500\n  - Medication: 1,500\n- **Training:**\n  - Employee Training: 2,000\n  - Managerial Training: 2,000\n- **Maintenance:**\n  - Offices Maintenance: 3,000\n  - Laptops and Mobile Phones Maintenance: 1,500\n- **Other Expenditures:**\n  - Unforeseen Expenditures: 5,000\n\n**Impact of a Biblical Stewardship Perspective on the Proposed Financial Plan:**\nA biblical perspective on stewardship assumes that leaders are entrusted by God with the care of people and resources (Carradus, Zozimo, & Discua Cruz, 2020). Hence, they should ensure the well-being of everyone involved to honor God. This financial plan is crafted to benefit all stakeholders, including healthcare providers of critical patients and consulting staff.\n\n**Potential Holes and Unknowns in the Project’s Financial Plan:**\nWhile the financial plan addresses many expected expenses, some unknowns remain. According to O’Connell (2020), managers should consider worst-case scenarios and be prepared to respond accordingly. In this plan, predicting the actual demand for mental health services among doctors is challenging, impacting the ability to estimate the required number of mental health workers. Additionally, potential crises and resulting inflation may increase costs for equipment, medication, services, training, and maintenance.\n\n**Assumptions to Fill Potential Holes in the Project’s Financial Plan:**\nTo address the uncertainty in demand for mental health services, assume an average demand among healthcare professionals. This assumption helps mitigate the risks of either underserving patients due to low expected demand or incurring financial losses due to high expected demand. For inflation concerns, allocate a certain amount of money for unforeseen expenditures, ensuring that rising prices won't hinder the ability to cover planned expenses.",
    "In the article “The Influence of Peers During Adolescence: Does Homophobic Name-Calling by Peers Change Gender Identity?”, the authors assert that negative name-calling among peers can significantly alter gender identity. Such negative experiences with same-sex peers often lead adolescents to identify with peers of the opposite sex. Additionally, since adolescents' identities are still forming, they are continuously reassessing their sense of self. DeLay et al. (2018) recognize that homophobia can target both homosexual and heterosexual adolescents, primarily aiming to inflict emotional pain rather than pointing out actual flaws. They stress that gender identity development is a crucial aspect of personality formation during adolescence and that homophobic name-calling, as a form of victimization, should be strictly prohibited in schools.\n\nIoverno et al. (2021) further note that bullying related to gender non-conformity often serves as a defense mechanism for bullies to affirm their own gender conformity. This is particularly true for male bullies who may select victims based on perceived gender non-conformity. Understanding this dynamic is essential for addressing gender victimization effectively, highlighting the need for psychological interventions for bullies.\n\nMoreover, the victimization of LGB, trans, and heterosexual high school students can result in severe mental health issues, including anxiety, depression, and substance use disorders, especially among sexual and gender minority youth (Valido et al., p. 602). This underscores the urgency of implementing preventive measures against substance abuse among adolescents and recognizing it as a consequence of underlying psychological distress.",
    "The first mention of a homosexual act is found in the Old Testament Book of Leviticus, where it is addressed in a prohibitive manner: “Do not lie with a man as with a woman; this is an abomination.” (Leviticus 18:22) The Apostle Paul echoes this sentiment in the New Testament, stating: “Men, having rejected natural relations with women, burned with lust for one another; men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error.” (Romans 1:27)\n\nFirstly, when discussing homosexuality, the scriptures refer to “intercourse” or “lust,” not to sexual orientation as understood today—an equal romantic relationship between two partners of the same sex. Homosexual relationships have existed throughout history and across various societies. However, the concept of “orientation” as an inherent characteristic of an individual is relatively modern, emerging only in the late 19th century. This makes direct comparisons of homosexuality within the context of Christianity challenging (Kuefler 1256).\n\nSecondly, comparing religious texts on homosexual relationships with relationships with women is crucial. In ancient and medieval times, homosexuality existed but was never viewed as an equal union. In the Christian context, severe punishments, including execution, were prescribed for sodomites. In England, executions for sodomy occurred until the modern era; during the Inquisition, homosexuals were frequently targeted. The Code of Justinian in Byzantium imposed harsh penalties, including castration and death. These persecutions were often driven by religious convictions.\n\nDespite the prevalence of homosexuality, there was no contemporary understanding of these relationships as equal unions, not even at a philosophical level. Such behaviors were considered deviations from the norm and fundamentally unacceptable.",
    "The framers of the Constitution did not envision a citizenry actively involved in the political life of the country. While the Constitution enshrined many freedoms, its creators doubted that people would be sufficiently engaged to keep up with its workings. Back then, limited access to information reinforced this belief. However, in today's world, mass media have become powerful tools to keep the public well-informed about political events. The media not only report on these events but also play a crucial role in holding government accountable (\"How Does the Media Affect Politics\").\n\nModern citizens are far from the indifferent and uninformed populace the framers feared. Numerous organizations now advocate for civil rights and closely monitor the political landscape. People today do not wait for a crisis to express their views; they actively seek to stay informed and engaged with political affairs (Jach & Trolian, 2022). The media facilitate this by providing instant access to global events (Greenberg & Page, 2015).\n\nWhile a crisis can intensify political interest, many individuals consistently strive to voice their opinions, regardless of the political or economic climate. These proactive citizens, who serve as watchdogs over the judicial, legislative, and executive branches, deserve immense respect. They help ensure that the powers granted to our politicians and judges by law are exercised responsibly, safeguarding the democratic principles upon which our nation was founded.",
    "Olivier Armantier and colleagues' article, \"How Economic Crises Affect Inflation Beliefs: Evidence from the COVID-19 Pandemic,\" was published on July 24, 2021, in the Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization. Publisher Elsevier collaborates with the Copyright Center RightsLink service to provide various options for reutilizing this content. Elsevier offers open or restricted access to content with permanent unique identifiers, including links and citations. This paper independently analyzes the state of the public economy during COVID-19. The authors investigate shifts in inflation perceptions during the first six months of the pandemic. Although independent, Armantier et al. (2021) complement other studies examining economic changes during the COVID-19 recession. A notable feature of the article is the authors' examination of inflationary crises' consequences, comparing them with previous crises to assess the overall impact. The survey's primary aim is to gather a broad range of economic outcomes.\n\nThrough their research, the authors studied the evolution of households' inflation perceptions and found that expectations for inflation growth were restrained. This means that the muted reaction of average inflation expectations conceals significant polarization of views, particularly in the short term (Bekaert et al., 2020). A significant portion of households, especially those with higher education, initially expected the pandemic to lead to low inflation or even deflation (Armantier et al., 2021). The authors successfully achieved their goal and supported their findings with numerous graphs and tables presented in the article. \n\nI appreciated Armantier et al.'s (2021) study for its focus on non-traditionally triggered crises and household responses. Additionally, through comparative analysis with past crises, they determine how erroneous inflation assumptions spread to other economic areas (Armantier et al., 2021). For instance, the Great Recession primarily involved a strong negative demand shock driven by falling house and stock prices. Moreover, I liked that the authors found evidence of strong polarization in inflation perceptions and identified differences among demographic groups.",
    "With the rise of digital technology, email has become essential, revolutionizing communication by enabling real-time interactions with colleagues, relatives, loved ones, and business partners. This shift eliminates the challenges of physical communication. Examining the impact of email reveals two key effects on interpersonal communication.\n\nFirst, email has expanded communication beyond the physical realm, allowing for seamless online interactions and altering perceptions of interpersonal exchanges. This shift enhances communication accessibility and convenience. Second, email diminishes the role of nonverbal cues, such as emotions and body language, especially in business correspondence, where these elements are irrelevant (Smith, n.d.). While emojis and stickers offer alternatives, they are seldom used in emails compared to messaging apps.\n\nEmail’s primary advantages include increased accessibility, virtually limitless communication, and constant connectivity. However, it also has drawbacks: reliance on internet equipment, needing electronic devices, and cybersecurity concerns. Mistakes are common in electronic correspondence as individuals tend to apply real-world communication skills to the digital space. These errors include ignoring the recipient's context, lacking digital etiquette, mixing writing styles, and sending lengthy, unstructured messages (CNBC, 2018).\n\nTo minimize these mistakes, learning electronic etiquette is recommended. Always review messages before sending them, consider the appropriate use of slang and style for specific recipients, and keep messages concise yet meaningful.",
    "Despite numerous calls to focus on customer satisfaction and improve employee engagement, many American corporate executives remain fixated on their companies' financial growth. Nevertheless, profitability is the primary indicator of a company's success. If a company stops making money, it may eventually cease operations. Some businesses lack the financial resources to fully take advantage of market growth opportunities, while others have the means but lack suitable opportunities. Both financial resources and market opportunities dictate a company's growth rate.\n\nTo determine the optimal growth rate, managers must understand the relationship between inflation, capital costs, profitability, growth, and the market value of the company's common stock (Fruhan, 2014). A company's profitability hinges on two factors: the expected return on equity (ROE) and the cost of capital. If the ROE is expected to exceed the cost of equity capital, then growth will positively impact the business. Conversely, if the ROE does not surpass the cost of capital, the company should consider slowing its growth.\n\nInsufficient earnings combined with merely financing inflation-induced revenue growth can severely undermine a firm's value (Fruhan, 2014). In such cases, businesses should adopt strategies to reduce growth unless they can increase revenue. To maintain appropriate growth, a company must meet or exceed inflation expectations. For instance, with a 10% inflation rate, a company must not only maintain its earnings but aim for higher results.\n\nAccording to Dow Jones statistics between 1965 and 1981, the inflation rate rose significantly each year (Fruhan, 2014). Consequently, while Treasury bonds yield about 11%, overall long-term inflation expectations are around 10% (Fruhan, 2014). Thus, companies need to achieve a growth rate of approximately 19-20% to keep the cost of equity capital for common stock in check.\n\nBusinesses must match their growth rate to inflation and other key indicators. To remain attractive to investors, a company must consider long-term inflation rates. Given that Treasury bonds are expected to yield 10% annually, companies need to offer a premium of 9-10%, resulting in a total growth rate of 19-20%. Failure to meet investor expectations or surpass inflation rates can be detrimental. Therefore, companies must monitor their ROE and the cost of equity capital—growth is beneficial only when ROE exceeds the cost of capital. Unmanaged rapid growth can damage a company's financial health.",
    "The chapter discusses how global trade has enriched and transformed cultures. Wealthy rulers and merchants displayed their power by acquiring exotic art, while ideas and books circulated widely, leading to active cultural exchange and greater tolerance of diversity. European influence spread, making Western norms seem universal (Adelman et al., 2021, p. 597). The Enlightenment era emphasized human reason, promoting the belief in understanding natural and human laws. The chapter’s importance lies in its comprehensive analysis, considering contributions from all continents. It details the formation of the Ottoman, Safavid, and Mughal dynasties in West and South Asia and their cultural impacts, as well as developments in China, Japan, the Americas, Africa, and Australia. Cultural interactions spurred global development during the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries, marked by increased book consumption and the creation of new monuments (Adelman et al., 2021, p. 595). International trade led to a highly integrated world, though not all regions embraced these changes. The Islamic and Chinese worlds maintained their identities, while America and Oceania faced European cultural pressure.",
    "Summary\n\nNowadays, opioids are the most popular drugs in the U.S. They've been great for pain relief for ages, but people started using them to relax and have fun, leading to rampant abuse. The euphoric high they provide makes them super addictive. People hooked on opioids constantly crave higher doses, which is a big deal medically and socially. The U.S. is in a massive drug crisis, with over half the drug-related deaths linked to prescription opioids like heroin and fentanyl (Coon et al., 2022). This issue got even worse during the COVID-19 pandemic. It’s become a huge economic drag and a threat to national security.\n\nTreatment Options for Opioid Addiction\n\nThe best way to beat opioid addiction is substitution therapy. This means using less addictive drugs as legal alternatives to more dangerous ones like heroin. Currently, methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone are the approved options for this therapy (Volkow et al., 2014). These meds are carefully chosen to avoid bad side effects. For instance, methadone can cause strong withdrawal symptoms if stopped abruptly. To help with that, doctors might use tranquilizers, antidepressants, antipsychotics, and non-opioid painkillers. They also use supportive therapies and closely monitor patients during severe withdrawal.\n\nHelping a Friend or Family Member with Opioid Addiction\n\nFamily support is key to motivating someone to overcome addiction. Rehab centers can be very effective, offering unique programs to help people not only kick the habit but also return to a healthy lifestyle (Brown, 2018). To effectively motivate someone, psychiatrists need to know all about the person’s background. This means getting help from friends and family to understand their habits, interests, and relationships.",
    "Social responsibility involves the policies that businesses implement to ensure their operations are effective and beneficial for all stakeholders. These guidelines aim to protect the environment, enhance the quality of life for communities, and create a positive working environment by recognizing and valuing talented and dedicated employees. This approach increases customer loyalty as customers feel they are supporting worthwhile initiatives, leading to greater access to funds and attracting more investors. Meaningful praise and trust in employees' decision-making abilities are used to reward and empower staff, fostering a sense of appreciation and motivation. Additional incentives include annual or semi-annual bonuses, paid time off, and cash prizes, which boost performance and morale.\n\nThe company also adopts a business code of ethics to shape employees' conduct regarding morals, standards, environmental responsibilities, self-esteem, and customer service. Reliable systems are in place to protect staff and prevent accidents and injuries. Suppliers are expected to adhere to responsible practices, such as fair pricing, and are screened to ensure they meet these standards.\n\nOne suggested improvement for the organization's approach to CSR is enhancing how it handles employee creativity. Encouraging brainstorming sessions could foster new ideas and innovation. Despite concerns about the company's engagement and expenditures, it is evident that the business is committed to improving its CSR efforts, which benefits the company through increased brand recognition and sales.\n\nNestle, for example, has made significant strides in becoming a socially responsible and environmentally sustainable corporation, improving living standards, providing access to clean water and hygiene, and promoting healthy lifestyles. It is recommended that the company implement an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process to identify potential events that could impact the business, manage risks and opportunities, and provide meaningful assurance regarding company objectives.",

    "Neil Foley discusses the impact of Mexican Americans on U.S. history in \"Mexicans in the Making of America.\" In the first chapter, “The Genesis of Mexican America,” he examines the emergence of Mexican Americans and the tensions between the U.S. and Mexico. Foley argues that the American government created a negative stereotype of Mexican immigrants as lazy criminals crossing the border for murder and drug trafficking, which also affected Mexican Americans (Foley 34). However, many white settlers in Texas during the 1830s were illegal immigrants themselves, refusing to follow local laws (Imery-Garcia 12).\n\nDiscrimination against Mexican immigrants and citizens has roots in the 1846-1848 war and its resulting treaty, which incorporated Texas and its Mexican residents into the U.S. but denied them rights. The chapter also highlights the prevailing U.S. view of Mexico as uncivilized, overlooking its rich Aztec heritage, early abolition of slavery, and the unjust annexation of Texas. The war between the U.S. and Mexico was a violent, unfair act by a stronger nation against a weaker one struggling economically (Foley 24).\n\nPost-war legislation offered Mexican residents a choice to return to Mexico or become U.S. citizens, though their rights were often ignored (Gutiérrez 5). To avoid discrimination, many preferred to be seen as Spanish Americans instead of acknowledging their Mexican roots. Foley concludes that this historical event not only established a political border but also created lasting misunderstandings between the two nations.\n\nIn summary, the first chapter of Foley’s book explores the origins of Mexican Americans, focusing on how the war over Texas shaped future relations and negative perceptions. This annexation harmed the relationship between the U.S. and Mexico, leading to stigmatization of Mexican immigrants and prompting Mexican Americans to hide their heritage.",
    "When multiple people engage simultaneously, particularly in educational settings, conflicts and disagreements can arise easily. Talkative or negative participants can significantly impact the group's dynamic (Jacobs et al., 2016). \"Show-offs,\" who seek to impress others, especially the leader, often irritate their peers with constant talking and boasting (Jacobs et al., 2016). This behavior distracts the group and hinders overall productivity.\n\nShow-offs typically crave attention due to insecurity or lack of confidence, which leads them to dominate conversations and answer questions not directed at them. They might pose irrelevant questions to capture the leader's attention, disrupting the group's focus. Persistent talking from such members can prevent a productive learning atmosphere, leaving others frustrated and less inclined to engage.\n\nMoreover, show-offs can derail the group's objectives through their incessant need for attention, thus lowering the overall effectiveness of the learning process. Their behavior stifles opportunities for other members to contribute and realize their potential, ultimately harming the group's productivity and cohesiveness (Forsyth, 2019).",
    "The airline industry has faced a turbulent journey due to Covid-19. The pandemic's impact led governments worldwide to impose travel restrictions (Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Aviation, 2022), significantly disrupting airlines' usual revenue streams and operations. Initially, passenger reluctance to travel, fueled by the hassle of testing requirements, resource limitations, and a diminished need for business trips, contributed to the downturn. Moreover, stringent quarantine measures aimed at curbing the virus further slashed travel demand, resulting in monumental revenue losses for airlines, amounting to $372 billion—a seismic shift for the industry (Economic impacts of covid-19 on Civil Aviation, 2021).\n\nThe aftermath saw flights canceled and employees laid off, as airlines struggled to keep airports operational amidst the dwindling passenger numbers. This led to a drastic 50% reduction in available seats and a drop of 2.7 billion passengers traveling by air (Economic impacts of covid-19 on Civil Aviation, 2021). Despite the grim scenario, cargo flights provided a silver lining, as the demand for medical supplies transportation kept this sector buoyant (Nižetić, 2020, p. 10953).\n\nHowever, as vaccines rolled out and travel restrictions eased in 2021, the skies began to clear. The relaxation of regulations and increased vaccination rates brought a breath of fresh air to the industry, reducing the revenue loss to $324 billion. While these numbers still reflect hard times, 2021 marked the beginning of a recovery trend, promising brighter skies ahead for the airline sector.",
    "The researchers based their conclusion on three in-depth case studies using different software applications. These case studies looked at bone fractures from car accidents, injuries from a spade, and gunshot wounds to the head. These scenarios helped gather useful data to improve modern forensic investigations (Buck et al., 2008). The study utilized modeling software and a haptic device known for their high accuracy, low friction, and advanced capabilities in simulating six degrees of freedom. Such features are considered top-of-the-line today. However, repeating the study to confirm the results might be tough due to the high cost of gathering all the necessary samples and equipment (Pinzon et al., 2016). \n\nThe researchers did a commendable job by drawing their conclusions from the data obtained from these three distinct case studies. The findings suggest that haptic devices can be very useful in forensic investigations after death. They help investigators recreate crime scenes, like determining the position of a gun, and identifying the object used in the crime more accurately and quickly. Hagmann et al. (2021) point out that using haptics in forensic science can speed up the criminal justice process and make investigations more reliable and accurate. \n\nThis research is quite innovative as it allows technology to recreate crime scenes and lets users feel and manipulate 3D digital information, which is typically not possible in virtual scenarios. This tactile feedback is a significant improvement over current technologies. However, Joukal et al. (2015) warn that there could be controversies over using haptics because of fears about system corruption or hacking, which might affect the reliability of these devices in the legal process. Additionally, the equipment and training required for these devices are expensive, which could make investigations costly and limit their use in low-income areas (Fahrni et al., 2019). Despite these challenges, the innovation is clear, and the researchers have drawn strong conclusions from their well-designed case studies.",
    "The Origins of Slavery and Its Evolution in the American Territories\n\nFrom 1526 until 1776, a myriad of complex forces shaped the structure of slavery in the United States. Historians have proposed numerous theories to explain the evolution of the slave trade during this period. Slavery was deeply tied to the labor demands of European colonies, especially in the labor-intensive sugar plantations of the Caribbean and South America, managed by Great Britain, Spain, France, and the Dutch Republic. Slave ships transported captives from Africa to these regions, while indigenous peoples were enslaved on a smaller scale in North American colonies. However, by the late eighteenth century, the enslavement of Native Americans had effectively ceased.\n\nDifferences in Slavery Practices Across British North American Colonies\n\nIn British North America, enslaved individuals contributed to various sectors, including breweries, shipyards, plantations, and timber yards. North of Maryland, slavery gradually transitioned to free labor. During the 1760s and 1770s, the slave population in the North declined sharply, with Philadelphia's enslaved population reducing to approximately 700 by 1775. The city was a hub of antislavery activism, where pamphleteers distributed abolitionist literature to both blacks and whites. The presence of antislavery groups promoted manumissions, making slavery increasingly untenable in the North. In New York, despite the prevailing pro-independence sentiment, many slaves acquired skilled trades such as masonry and goldsmithing, working alongside artisan masters. New York eventually freed all its slaves in 1827.\n\nContrasts Between Indentured Servants and Slaves\n\nIndentured servitude differed significantly from slavery. It was a form of debt servitude where individuals agreed to a period of unpaid labor to cover the costs of their immigration to America. While indentured servants were typically provided with housing, clothing, and food, they did not receive wages. In contrast, slaves were regarded as property and rarely achieved freedom, notwithstanding years of arduous labor. They were bought, sold, traded, and even bequeathed as property in wills.",
    "The topic of tribal sovereignty has been a hot subject over the years, with tribes facing everything from positive support and efforts to integrate them into the wider community, to outright persecution. One way tribal sovereignty has been acknowledged is through tribal gaming laws, which recognize tribes’ unique lifestyles and right to self-determination. This essay explores how the Tribal Gaming Act contributes to the sovereignty of tribes.\n\nUnder the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, tribes gained the right to decide what gaming activities they wanted to engage in, with states usually granting permission. These activities could range from traditional tribal rituals to games of chance, depending on what the tribes wanted, and had to be agreed upon by the state (Light and Rand). Since many tribal games hold deep cultural significance, allowing tribes to conduct their own games is crucial. This supports their culture and strengthens their control over an important part of life—recreation.\n\nGaming also helps sustain traditions and customs through long-standing rituals. Regarding sovereignty, gaming marks areas of life entirely under tribal control. For instance, while some tribe members mix with broader society, finding jobs or settling in big cities, traditional tribal gaming keeps them connected to their roots. It promotes freedom of choice and sovereignty because it's one aspect that's almost entirely within the tribes’ jurisdiction.",
    "Individual freedoms and national security are sometimes seen as opposites. However, ideally, national security should reflect a balance between these concepts. Furthermore, the principle of prioritizing individual freedoms over national security is fundamental to democracy. Individual freedoms encompass rights protected by the U.S. Constitution (Longley). This paper argues that individual freedoms should never be sacrificed for national security. It proposes that protecting individual freedoms while maintaining national security is a core principle of democracy. U.S. President Joe Biden states, \"I strongly believe that democracy is the key to freedom, prosperity, peace, and dignity\" (Biden 3). Unlike authoritarian systems, democracies prioritize individual freedoms over national security interests. Implementing this principle often stirs controversy, as no single rule applies universally. Nonetheless, individual freedoms are protected in various aspects of social life, including migration, cybersecurity, economic stability, and international diplomacy. Notably, current cybersecurity policies balance human-centric and national-security-centric approaches (Deibert 411). States develop \"indivisible network security on a planetary scale for the widest possible coverage of the human experience\" (Deibert 412). This demonstrates the broad application of the principle. There may be arguments that national security should take precedence over individual freedoms, often justified by external threats or military ambitions in authoritarian regimes. This viewpoint is flawed since national security should protect each citizen's interests, not just the abstract idea of the nation. Every citizen is part of the nation, and their freedoms should be sacred. Thus, it is clear that individual freedoms should never be sacrificed for national security. The call to sacrifice individual freedoms often serves authoritarian regimes' interests. In contrast, democratic states consider individual freedoms fundamental and inviolable. These freedoms are sacred and uphold the integrity of democratic states.",
    "\"Diamonds\" by Rihanna premiered on the Elvis Duran Show on September 26, 2012, and was available for download an hour later. It was released as the lead single from her seventh album, \"Unapologetic,\" on the following day. Written by Sia, who also provided a demo guide, Rihanna closely followed Sia's vocal inflections. Benny Blanco recognized the similarity only after hearing the final track. The song’s lyrics, incorporating \"yellow diamonds in the light,\" symbolize hope amid darkness. \"Diamonds\" inspired reflection on potential and positivity, making listeners feel uplifted. Winning multiple awards since its release, it significantly boosted Rihanna’s career with its catchy and recognizable tune.",
    "Different conditions under which medical staff operate have led to the development of diverse leadership strategies. For instance, the COVID-19 pandemic underscored the importance of clear communication and proactive preparation among top healthcare leaders (Nicola et al., 2020). Another crucial approach is the utilization of external change agents to enhance organizational decision-making (Alagoz et al., 2018). Additionally, one study found that leaders who adopt positive and open-minded strategies can boost their employees' resilience, providing an extra layer of motivation (Wei et al., 2018). Thus, effective healthcare leaders must be adaptable to various external changes and strategically communicate with their team. \n\nHealthcare administrators interact with several departments, including the in-patient department, which requires diverse approaches from skilled professionals. Furthermore, critical care and A&E demand excellent management and collaboration. As previously mentioned, these areas necessitate strong leadership to ensure optimal patient care. Improving outcomes can be achieved through a holistic approach that takes into account both external and internal factors. \n\nCollective decision-making should not be seen as a hindrance to effective leadership; in fact, it can be an ideal strategy in healthcare management. Interprofessional collaboration's importance in medical institutions is clear, as it significantly affects patient outcomes. Research has shown notable improvements in healthcare conditions following the adoption of this strategy (Spaulding et al., 2018). This method involves learning from colleagues and integrating their expertise into one’s practice, as well as seeking advice from fellow medical staff. Consequently, it enhances the range of services professionals can offer to their patients and should be further refined to increase its effectiveness.",
    "Net Present Value (NPV) represents the expected cash returns an investor or funder anticipates from a project after accounting for all costs associated with it. This metric essentially reflects the investor’s total profit once the recoupment of initial outlays begins. NPV serves as a vital indicator of a project’s investment worthiness by evaluating likely costs and potential risks.\n\nNPV offers several advantages over alternative investment criteria. It is grounded in common sense and reasonableness, factoring in return criteria. Unlike static measures, NPV considers a time horizon, making it inherently more profitable. A key strength of NPV is its alignment with the concept of expected value, acknowledging that this value will be less at the time of investment. Unlike the payback period, NPV accounts for the time value of money by integrating discount rates into its calculation, reflecting the temporary and fluctuating value of currency.\n\nFurthermore, assumptions regarding the cost of capital facilitate NPV calculations and inform profitable project implementation strategies. Therefore, another advantage of NPV is its flexibility and additivity, which allows for the holistic evaluation of multiple projects or a single specific project. Additionally, the calculation of NPV takes the investment size into consideration, providing a unidimensional criterion that estimates the probability of wealth creation based on cash flows.\n\nIn summary, NPV offers numerous benefits over other investment criteria. It considers the present value of money, providing a clear picture of cash transactions. It is flexible and additive, evaluating the cost of capital and the soundness of investments. Finally, NPV is a one-dimensional indicator that factors in all investments, including large-scale projects.",
    "To effectively manage business outcomes, it's essential to evaluate the external environment of the industry in question. For 7-Eleven, adopting the I/O Model of Above-Average Returns, which emphasizes assessing the firm’s external conditions, could be highly advantageous. The initial step involves analyzing the industry and competitor landscape to understand the broader environment (Hitt et al., 2007). For 7-Eleven, major competitors include large convenience store chains like Walmart and Target. The industry's growth and significant revenue generation create a conducive atmosphere for further development.\n\nAnother critical aspect is the attractiveness of the industry, which must have high potential for the company to achieve above-average returns. Currently, the convenience store segment is particularly favorable for securing above-average returns due to the growing demand for large-scale product distribution shops (Graves, 2017). The increasing variety of choices and the improving financial status of American consumers indicate that the industry's structural characteristics are advantageous.\n\nFollowing the industry analysis, 7-Eleven needs to choose a strategy to ensure above-average returns. One effective approach could be the chain store model, which involves establishing multiple branches across different countries. However, this strategy requires specific assets and expertise (Hitt et al., 2007). For instance, owning the necessary products and resources is crucial for launching an international branch, as the costs of opening and maintaining a new location abroad can be significant (Graves, 2017). Additionally, the company's leaders must consider the economic conditions of the target country and possess skills in international trade and branch management.\n\nTo successfully implement the chosen strategy, 7-Eleven should leverage its strengths, such as its existing international branches and its successful operations history in the US (Lee, 2021). By capitalizing on past experiences and incorporating global expansion into its strategic goals, 7-Eleven can effectively execute the formulated strategy and achieve above-average returns.",
    "The strategies proposed to mitigate the effects of the coronavirus, inspired by Iceland's example, present an interesting approach. This strategy recognizes its limitations, such as the resilience of the Icelandic community and geographical uniqueness. However, this approach may not effectively address the high rates of infection in NATO countries. While swift responses and high testing rates could help counter the virus's rapid spread, public willingness to comply is equally important. Additionally, despite financial support efforts, some NATO countries may struggle to afford extensive testing amid new infection waves. This is especially relevant as the virus might spread across multiple countries simultaneously, necessitating a different strategy.\n\nThe Israeli government tackled the issue of monitoring infections with the innovative solution of digital epidemiological investigation (Amit et al., 2020). This technology enabled tracking potential contacts of infected individuals and taking timely action (Amit et al., 2020). However, it's debatable whether this method could overcome Iceland's geographical limitations. It would be challenging for NATO countries to monitor all border crossings strictly. Thus, digital tracking could address the need for strict border control and offer tools for a prompt response to new outbreaks. Nevertheless, implementing this would require both internal and external funding to build or upgrade the necessary infrastructure.",
    "The Canadian perspective on the provisional agenda of the North Atlantic Council addresses key points pertinent to Canada’s security. The agenda emphasizes Canada's increased presence in global peace operations and the maintenance of robust relationships with other NATO members, with particular attention to a smart defense approach that considers both military and economic aspects.\n\nHowever, evaluating the Syrian threat to Canadian interests remains challenging amidst the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Therefore, it is crucial to review the proposed strategies for a more effective defense of Canadian interests. This initiative appears to protect the interests of both Israel and Canada, potentially strengthening their bilateral relationship. Additionally, the Canadian government's readiness to cooperate with the withdrawal of troops from Iraq, if officially requested, underscores Canada's contribution to its international humanitarian image, though the extent of this image enhancement is uncertain.\n\nBuilding trading relationships and fostering close ties with other NATO countries could be seen as the most important aspect acknowledged by Israel. Israel’s national security has faced decades of varied threats, including terrorism, missile attacks, and existential nuclear dangers. Despite the absence of a formal national security strategy since the first document was developed in 1953, Israel is more secure than ever. This security is underpinned by political and military bonds and active trade agreements with powerful nations such as the USA, China, Russia, Germany, Canada, Poland, and India. Consequently, Israel now exhibits significant regional power and prosperity, owing to its long-standing strategic alliances.",
    "Nike's current issue originates from a corrupt corporate culture that places women in vulnerable positions, allowing powerful male executives to exploit and suppress them. This prevents women from advancing to positions they deserve without facing harassment or degradation. According to Ackoff (2019), there are four ways to address a problem: absolving, solving, resolving, and dissolving. Considering Nike's long-term goals and broader societal implications, the only viable solution is dissolution, which involves eliminating the root causes of the problem entirely. Absolving means ignoring the issue, solving involves compensating harmed women without systemic change, and resolving gives them means to fight back without improving the toxic culture (Singh, 2018). Just enabling women to resist harassment is insufficient—Nike should ensure they don't face such threats at all.\n\nTo transform Nike’s culture, changes must be implemented comprehensively, from top to bottom. If harassment, cronyism, and corruption are tolerated at the highest levels, they will inevitably persist at lower levels as well (Singh, 2018). Hence, Parker and Nike’s leadership must introduce policies and practices that discourage such behavior and eradicate its sources. The proposed action plan involves a thorough review of every employee and manager to assess their involvement in the ongoing misconduct. Those found complicit should be removed from the organization, including Mr. Parker and the entire board, as they have been benefiting from and ignoring the corrupt system. New leadership should be appointed to foster a culture grounded in equality, competence, and diversity.",
    "The significant socio-economic disparities in American society have influenced unemployment levels even before the COVID-19 pandemic, but the pandemic has intensified the issue. Two clear experiences emerged during the pandemic: people with advanced education maintained stable jobs by working remotely, while others faced job loss or reduced hours without any safety net (Blustein et al., 2020). Job availability is primarily determined by power and privilege, which are distributed unevenly across lines of race, gender, and education (Blustein et al., 2020). Socio-economic gaps within the nation are most prominent between those with a college education and those without (Galea & Abdalla, 2020). Education access is a significant dividing factor, with race and ethnicity being major contributors to this division. Black Americans routinely face discrimination in employment, housing, and daily life, leading to systemic marginalization (Galea & Abdalla, 2020). Consequently, job availability remains unequal, with racial disparities becoming particularly pronounced. Analyzing post-pandemic recovery rates from April 2020 reveals this divide. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (2022) shows that while the average national unemployment rate decreased from 14.7% in April 2020 to 4% now, the unemployment rate for Black Americans was 16.8% in April 2020, stalled at 10.9% in October 2020, and only dropped to 6.9% by January 2022 (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2022). Conversely, unemployment for white Americans fell steadily from 14.1% in April 2020 to 6.0% by October 2020. Factors such as higher education, stable jobs, and support networks contribute to the higher-than-average unemployment rates among the Black demographic (Galea & Abdalla, 2020). These statistics highlight the unequal challenges different socio-economic groups face in recovering from both pandemic-related and general unemployment.",
    "James Brown, a towering figure in soul music, achieved his first success in 1956 with \"Please Please Please.\" Initially standing in for Little Richard, Brown's early style echoed 1950s doo-wop. By 1960, he was pioneering soul with hits like \"Think,\" featuring prominent horns and driving rhythms. In 1964, he further defined his sound with \"Out of Sight,\" leading to the hard-driving soul of his later years.\n\nUnlike Motown, Stax, or Atlantic artists, Brown's unique style evolved throughout the 1960s and 1970s. His 1965 hit \"Papa’s Got a Brand New Bag, Pt. 1\" distinguished itself with rhythmic stops and minimal background vocals, setting it apart from the typical Stax and Motown arrangements. Brown's music resonated deeply within the Black community, blending hard-edged sounds with political lyrics and displaying clear racial pride.\n\nOnstage, Brown was a dynamic force, combining singing, dancing, and bandleading, while offstage, he honed his production skills and business acumen. He hired and rigorously rehearsed top musicians, solidifying his reputation as a visionary performer whose influence extended beyond music to societal norms.",
    "In the novel Drive Your Plow over the Bones of the Dead, Janina’s unique use of language stands out, particularly her habit of assigning nicknames rather than using actual names for people and animals. Unlike the typical use of nicknames for friends or those we dislike, Janina bases these substitutes on her perception of the individual. She explains, “I believe each of us sees the other person in our way, so we should give them the name we consider suitable,” viewing names as “polyonymous” and applying this to everyone she encounters. Consequently, characters in the story are labeled based on the traits she attributes to them. For example, her friend is dubbed Oddball, suggesting an inherent strangeness, and murder victims are named Big Foot, Commandant, and Inner, reflecting their appearance or status in her eyes.\n\nIn contrast, when naming a rescue dog, Janina considers a human name, Marysia, and dismisses typical pet names due to the dog’s “personal history.” This thoughtful naming highlights her empathy towards animals compared to her judgmental view of humans, whom she often labels based on their quirks or flaws. Despite being an unreliable narrator, Janina reveals her values: she judges people for their treatment of animals, whom she deems more deserving of compassion and salvation than humans. This perspective hints at her role and motives in the unfolding mystery of the murders.",
    "John Smeaton, an eminent English engineer, made significant contributions to the design of bridges, canals, and lighthouses. In an article by Andrew M. A. Morris, the author elucidates how Smeaton utilized parameter variation within a broader analytical framework (Morris, 2021). Morris highlights three primary objectives of this process: optimization, theory testing, and the development of maxims through exploratory testing. He argues that Smeaton’s approach extended beyond merely refining engineering techniques by systematizing traditional artisanal methods, as previously interpreted by technology analysts in the 1990s (Morris, 2021). Instead, Morris posits that Smeaton’s methodology forged a vital connection between science and technology, incorporating both theoretical and practical testing (Morris, 2021). \n\nI concur with the author’s assessment that John Smeaton effectively engaged in hypothesis testing and established empirical regularities through exploratory experimentation. Although some scholars may argue that Smeaton’s work lacked scientific inquiry, he conducted rigorous analyses and formulated his own principles. Morris also examines the interplay between science and technology during the Industrial Revolution. He suggests that the prevailing understanding was shaped by two nearly obsolete historical perspectives, as seen in the discussions between A.E. Musson and Eric Robinson, and A. Rupert Hall (Morris, 2021). Musson and Robinson assert that science was integral to the Industrial Era (Morris, 2021), whereas Hall contends that 18th-century technological advances owed little to the science of the period.\n\nIn my opinion, Hall’s stance is unfounded. The Industrial Revolution represented a convergence of technology, science, and industry. Remarkable innovations and technological advances affected nearly every aspect of life and introduced numerous new fields. It is well-documented that early in the Revolution, natural energy sources such as wind and water were harnessed to produce electricity. Later, technologies like steam power were explored and refined by John Smeaton, with electricity playing a crucial role in the ongoing success of the Industrial Revolution.",
    "Exciting news! Washington State boasts one of the lowest percentages of uninsured individuals in the country. As of 2019, only 6.6% of people were uninsured, a stark contrast to Oklahoma's 14.9% and Texas's 18.4% (Kaiser Family Foundation, n.d.). This impressive statistic highlights the strong connection between socioeconomic status and access to healthcare. Financial stability significantly increases the ability to afford high-quality care, whereas financial insecurity often results in a lack of insurance or reliance on Medicaid. Unfortunately, those with low incomes may delay seeking medical attention until emergencies arise, neglecting preventive care and early treatment.\n\nOne of the key reasons for Washington's low uninsured rate is its prime geographic location, brimming with job opportunities that enable residents to afford health insurance. Moreover, Washingtonians are well-informed about their healthcare options. The state also boasts a high number of healthcare facilities, especially compared to rural areas, making quality care more accessible.\n\nWhen discussing disparities in healthcare access and quality, we must consider ethnic diversity, educational access, and community support as well. In Washington, residents from diverse backgrounds find it easier to adapt and receive support, unlike in parts of the country where ethnic minorities may face prejudice, hindering their pursuit of quality education and well-paying jobs.\n\nAll these factors combine to make Washington a shining example of how to achieve a high rate of insured residents and equitable healthcare access for all!",
    "Kantian ethics provides the most distinct example of non-consequential theories in both philosophy and law. Support for this theory often stems from proponents of social order ideas like utilitarianism. In Kant's philosophy, non-consequential ethics are best exemplified by his concept known as the categorical imperative. This concept outlines how individuals should act to engage in truly moral behavior (Kant & Abbott, 2021). The imperative addresses the individual making moral choices according to pre-established rational principles, urging them to strictly and attentively adhere to the rules of practical reason. According to Kant, the principles of pure practical reason have a distinctly non-consequential nature (Kant & Abbott, 2021). These principles define the will, which is subject to numerous practical rules, presenting unique challenges in their very essence. To thoroughly understand Kant’s view on ethics, one must recognize his stance that morality should be absolute and universal, not relative or influenced by private interests; otherwise, it ceases to exist (Kant & Abbott, 2021). In other words, relativism opposes genuine morality, as it makes principles contingent and adaptable to situations. This aspect of Kant’s philosophy highlights the conflict between the fundamental, universally necessary moral law, which Kant advocates, and the determined circumstances of specific individuals' actions. This conflict underscores Kant’s non-consequential ethical stance. Ultimately, a person cannot act without considering circumstances and forming their own subjective maxims of behavior. If people see no reason to abide by universal morality, the universal moral law—the categorical imperative—becomes merely an idea or a chimera.",
    "Labor racketeering involves the misuse of unions and their power for personal gain. In the early 20th century, organized criminal syndicates often directed or collaborated in union labor corruption. This issue became a significant concern for law enforcement and society (Jacobs, 2020). However, it wasn't until the late 1970s and early 1980s that systematic efforts by the government and enforcement agencies began to address the problem (Jacobs, 2020). During Prohibition, criminal groups capitalized on the high demand for illicit alcohol. After Prohibition ended in the 1930s, these groups shifted their focus to other profitable ventures, such as narcotics, gambling, and prostitution (Jacobs, 2020). \n\nLabor racketeering became another lucrative activity, as criminal organizations saw the potential in controlling labor unions. For instance, they targeted unions like the Teamsters and the International Longshoremen’s Association (Jacobs, 2020). By infiltrating these unions, organized crime members, including Cosa Nostra, gained access to legitimate industries such as waste management, construction, and demolition. They also tapped into union healthcare and pension funds, enabling them to mask their illegal activities and diversify profits (Jacobs, 2020).\n\nThese organized groups engaged in various criminal acts, including extortion, threats against employers, and accepting bribes. It's clear that organized crime has always sought to dominate local businesses and expand their influence through diversified income sources. Key activities for these gangs included prostitution, drug trafficking, gambling, and labor racketeering, with labor unions providing crucial resources for their operations.",
    "There are numerous scientific approaches to the study of language, with one being the prescriptive method. This method is typically characterized by a set of rules that dictate how language should be spoken or written. Crystal (1987) describes prescriptivism as a viewpoint that selects one interpretation of a language as the standard and imposes it upon the entire society. This approach is frequently observed in formal speech and literature. Conversely, the descriptive approach focuses on the actual usage of language rather than adhering to standards. Proponents of this method simply document linguistic variations (Crystal, 1987), acting as observers unbound by official constraints.\n\nDespite their opposing principles, both methods have contextual relevance. Crystal (1987) mentions that exploring these methods often results in an unrealistic portrayal of the other side, fostering prejudice and conflict. However, both approaches should coexist, leveraging their respective strengths. The prescriptive approach helps structure society, while the descriptive approach records genuine language changes (Crystal, 1987). This dual approach enables a balance between logic and natural linguistic evolution.\n\nYet, not all language changes are welcomed, often due to misunderstandings. A prime example is the misconception that change equates to deterioration, a common grievance among older generations (Crystal, 1987). Additionally, language changes are often wrongly blamed for declining education quality and the negative influence of the media. Crystal offers strong counterarguments to these concerns, noting that resistance to change is a historical constant among the older generations. Declines in education quality and social unrest typically only occur when changes happen abruptly, which is rare. \n\nI concur with Crystal (1987), who argues that the dislike of modern developments by the older generation is well-documented in literature. The media's influence and educational quality do not necessarily cause direct changes in language. My support for this position stems from the understanding that fear of change is common. Most people prefer the consistency of established habits and methods. However, language change is a natural, unavoidable process that evolves alongside society and its most progressive members.",
    "The evolving global management paradigm has revolutionized a cornerstone of management - the leadership process. The surge of technological and information advances has empowered businesses to scale operations globally. This dual-edged sword has opened doors for leaders to penetrate international markets while also necessitating strategic business transformations to outpace a myriad of competitors at every growth stage.\n\nEssentially, the first prerequisite for tomorrow's business leaders is having a company mission anchored in the pursuit of global leadership—anything less will fall short. Crafting change with global dominance in mind demands superior cultural management skills, as cultural diversity significantly influences leadership behaviors and actions. These cultural nuances impact everything from time management and decision-making to motivational strategies.\n\nLeadership is a pivotal force in the intricate web of international relations, shaping the trajectory of global political and economic processes. According to Ratanjee (2021), the emphasis on cultivating a global mindset through diverse multicultural experiences is increasingly gaining traction.\n\nFuture leaders are advised to embrace transformational leadership. Bonsu and Evans (2018) assert that \"embracing cross-cultural transformational leadership is strategic to business growth in an era of globalization, efficiency in technology and information dissemination, and parity of education and skills\" (p. 50). With vision and charisma, transformational leaders can galvanize their teams, reshaping expectations and driving toward greater ambitions.",
    "Goals and objectives describe desired outcomes and are often used interchangeably, but they differ in effect, timeframe, and specificity. Nickels et al. (2019) explain that goals are broad, long-term aspirations of an organization, while objectives are measurable, specific, and short-term strategies to achieve those goals. For instance, the criminal justice system uses goals to direct police, correctional agencies, and courts in implementing strategies like deterrence, rehabilitation, retribution, restoration, and incapacitation. The criminal justice system particularly aims to address criminal behavior with the objective of protecting individual rights. In a rapidly changing, diverse, and complex environment, effective leadership and management are essential for any agency's survival. Leadership and management skills permeate every level of the criminal justice system. Leaders drive change through vision, while managers coordinate processes and structures to meet organizational goals and objectives (Nickels et al., 2019). Leaders face the challenge of taking risks and fostering transformation. For example, in law enforcement, police leaders must develop and instill high standards in officers to achieve common goals. Beyond leadership, criminal justice relies on managers to optimize processes and ensure reliable outcomes. Leaders and managers in criminal justice work together to balance ethical and legal considerations. Earning a degree in criminal justice will help me achieve my long-term goals. I have always been proud of influencing change as a leader. However, gaining education combined with experience in the criminal justice system will make me more efficient and productive. The increasing complexity of the criminal justice system requires lasting and transformative trends, making adaptability to change another important goal. Bringing significant change through robust analytical skills and developing strong relational skills to work with professionals and serve diverse communities are also key objectives.",
    "The phrase that resonated most with me from the video is from Isaiah, who remarked that Samuel taught him that an individual can play t-ball and hit it hard even while sitting down. This powerful statement underscores the notion that individuals can harbor prejudices despite having good intentions. Samuel’s family was previously unaware of the challenges faced by disabled individuals until Samuel was born (PinehurstPictures, 2010). The image of the child hitting the t-ball also illustrated a significant issue: disabled individuals should be treated equitably and provided with equal opportunities to enable them to perform optimally. \n\nI found it intriguing to observe children like Nathanial Orellana learning in a regular classroom. His mother made a concerted effort to find a suitable school that would offer him the best care considering his autism (PinehurstPictures, 2010). Parents often encounter numerous additional challenges while raising disabled children, striving to provide them with advantages that would help them compete with their peers in society. The video suggests that communities and the government should offer parents a variety of school options to ensure the best fit for their child’s specific disability. While children with disabilities require special care, they should be permitted to interact with others if it would not worsen their condition. \n\nEngagement is a critical tool for child development, as it encourages attentiveness and active participation, resulting in greater achievement due to heightened enthusiasm. Nathanial’s act of raising his hand to answer a question demonstrates each student’s engagement in the classroom. His eagerness to respond reflects interest and a desire to learn, traits commonly associated with high achievement. The video is informative as it provides insight into the experiences of individuals with disabilities. Many parents face educational challenges, seeking the best schooling for their children while avoiding pitfalls that other children do not encounter.\n\nEmily, a mental health advocate living with schizophrenia, remarks that people without the illness cannot fully comprehend the struggles faced by those who have it (PinehurstPictures, 2010). Consequently, individuals without developmental disabilities may be unaware of these issues and should strive to assist those affected in functioning optimally within society. Keith Jones highlights an important societal faction. He asserts that it is unreasonable to expect children to develop good social skills if they spend eight hours in a classroom without adequate interaction (PinehurstPictures, 2010). Inclusion would be most effective if children were continuously given opportunities to interact, despite their differences.",
    "The article's thesis is bolstered by additional readings that delve into the peculiar shift in Professor Wilson's lifestyle. This decision, rooted in the pursuit of maximum sustainability within a minimal space, is multifaceted. The article highlights how Wilson shares his experiences with his ecology-focused students, who are invited to stay overnight in the dumpster with him.\n\nSeveral details in the article piqued my interest. Initially, the notion of a respected scholar residing in a dumpster evoked thoughts of the Ancient Greek philosopher Diogenes, who famously lived in a barrel. This parallel prompted me to explore further to see any similarities. Additionally, the inclusion of Professor Wilson's personal background, particularly his divorce, added a psychological dimension to the story, raising questions about the impact of life events on drastic lifestyle changes.\n\nThe visuals were particularly compelling; they provided a much-needed break and enriched the narrative, showing day-to-day activities and the interior of the dumpster. These images sparked further curiosity, motivating me to continue reading to find answers to my questions.\n\nInterestingly, the dumpster's interior appeared more comfortable than expected, allowing Wilson to lie down with ease. While this makes the idea of living in a dumpster occasionally appealing, especially for solitude, the lack of basic amenities like a kitchen and bathroom would prevent me from considering it a permanent residence.",
    "Imagine glancing around and noticing that people judge each other based solely on looks or push their bodies to extremes just to fit in. Both scenarios, lookism and extreme body modifications, stem from the same harsh beauty standards that society imposes. Yet, they manifest very differently and have unique impacts.\n\nLookism is when someone dismisses or critiques another person simply because they don’t fit conventional beauty norms. It's an external judgment, where insecurities and harsh evaluations are directed towards others who aren't seen as 'beautiful' by societal standards.\n\nOn the other hand, extreme body modification is a personal choice – or sometimes a societal expectation – to alter one's body in ways that defy those same norms. Think of it as someone making a bold statement with their appearance that screams, \"I don't fit your mold, and I'm okay with that.\"\n\nAt their core, both are about grappling with dissatisfaction over appearance. People who engage in lookism are often battling their own insecurities. By critiquing others, they momentarily mask their own self-doubt. This judgmental behavior is a sign of an unhealthy self-image, even if it's less obvious than the visible changes of body modification.\n\nBody modification, while sometimes a personal choice, can also be a deep-rooted social pressure. Take, for example, the ancient Chinese practice of foot binding, where women's feet were painfully reshaped to appear small and delicate—a practice borne out of societal expectations of beauty and respectability, often linked to a woman's marital prospects.\n\nSo, while lookism outwardly targets those who don’t conform, body modification often reflects a deeper struggle against or submission to societal pressures. It’s a complex dance between how we see ourselves and how we’re seen by others, all under the unforgiving spotlight of cultural beauty standards.",
    "\"The Prince,\" written by Nicholas Machiavelli, significantly contributes to the modern understanding of politics. This work stands in stark contrast to ancient political thought, which often idealized governments and utopian cities, overshadowing practical political practice. Unlike this tradition, Machiavelli (2014) argues that real politics involves real situations with real people, whose behavior, decisions, and actions are not necessarily guided by morality.\n\nThe central theme of Machiavelli's \"The Prince\" is the maintenance and survival of monarchical rule. The book serves as a guide for politicians, advocating the use of ruthless, self-serving cunning, which inspired the term \"Machiavellian.\" Machiavelli (2014) meticulously outlines how a ruler should act in various circumstances, emphasizing that the ultimate goal of politics is the successful retention of power. This perspective had a profound impact on political thought, opposing the traditional view that politics should serve the people to an approach where the ruler's self-interest and goals are paramount. The book justifies any means necessary to achieve these aims.\n\nThomas Hobbes also weighed in on human nature, suggesting that people are inherently egoistic and greedy, driven by personal gain. He considered egoism the primary motivator of human activity, but he did not condemn people for their selfishness, nor did he believe they were evil by nature. However, many criticize Hobbes' view as overly cynical and simplistic, arguing that not all actions can be attributed to egoism. For instance, numerous individuals and charitable organizations donate money and time without seeking personal gain.\n\nPersonally, I find human nature to be far more complex than the power-seeking individuals depicted in Hobbes' work.",
    "Culture runs deep and exists on many levels. Edgar Schein came up with the idea of ‘levels of organizational culture,’ and Edward Granter expanded on it. They break culture down into four layers: super-structural, symbolic, discursive, and cognitive (Granter, 2019). This basically means that a company’s culture is shaped by outside economic and social influences, visual elements like logos, stories and events, the values the organization openly expresses, and the underlying assumptions people make. \n\nIn this paper, we’re looking at the culture levels at Macomb Community College. When it comes to visible artifacts, you can see MCC promotes focus, attention to detail, and responsibility—just check out their logo. The architecture, with modern high-tech chrome structures, suggests that technology and science are key areas of focus. But the older central building and the peaceful park with large trees give off a vibe that supports studying fine arts and social sciences. \n\nThere’s a strong culture of mutual help and respect at MCC, which you can see in the developed bus routes for students. On the value level, plenty of signs around the college, like those in the parking lot and library, hint at a love for order and organization. It seems that at MCC, teachers value composure and commitment from their students. \n\nAt the assumption level, it seems the college tries to avoid admitting students who are too self-expressive or those whose identities are tied to mainstream pop culture. The website has no flashy headlines or programs involving frivolous activities like fundraising by selling cookies or field trips. \n\nSo, when we break down the organizational culture at MCC, it’s clear they have a strong identity in terms of artifacts and values. However, the underlying assumptions suggest some possible improvements. The college might be underestimating the importance of openness in relationships and could be a bit too harsh on superficial identities. Given their strong commitment to social and community values, the folks at Macomb Community College might want to consider that openness is crucial for building good social connections.",
    "The story of King Uruk, or Gilgamesh, is known as the first tale about the connection between humans and gods. The Epic of Gilgamesh is the earliest recorded mythology. It focuses on how King Uruk changed from a bad ruler to a kind one when faced with death. This shows that people in ancient times had similar feelings to us. According to Anneberg Learner (2021), it is older than the Bible, being “four thousand years old in its oldest form.”\n\nThe story highlights King Uruk because he was special, being “two-thirds divine and one-third human” (Anneberg Learner, 2021). The gods sent Enkidu, a copy of Gilgamesh, to deal with his arrogance. This made the king understand the value of social connections, “wonderful about being engaged with another human being” (Anneberg Learner, 2021). Enkidu, like Adam, was humanized by a prostitute sent by the gods. However, a mistake led to Enkidu's death, causing Gilgamesh to seek immortality.\n\nThe main idea is that immortality is meant only for gods, while humans must face death. When a serpent stole Gilgamesh's chance to live forever, he realized he could treasure his past and return to his city. In the end, the city outlived its ruler, leaving a lasting impression on humanity.",
    "Motivation is the process by which an individual's efforts are stimulated, directed, and sustained towards achieving a goal. Consequently, it is the responsibility of management to oversee and guide employees within a company (Usmonovich, 2021). This is essential since it serves as a means to encourage individuals to perform tasks they are capable of and equipped to handle willingly. Although most people need to work to earn a livelihood and a job is a fundamental aspect of everyone’s lives, administrators must be attuned to employee motivation for various reasons.\n\nManagers have several compelling reasons to focus on motivating employees. First, individual success within a company is often viewed as a result of talent and inspiration. Furthermore, talent is shaped by education, expertise, and learning—a progression that is both challenging and time-consuming—whereas motivation can be expedited (Usmonovich, 2021). Therefore, employee motivation is widely acknowledged as critical to a company's success. Additionally, organizations that struggle with employee motivation are more likely to encounter reduced productivity, defective products, and other challenges. It falls upon managers to ensure such issues are prevented (Usmonovich, 2021).\n\nSecondly, an administrator's role is to achieve organizational objectives through their staff. To maintain desired outcomes, leaders need to recognize declining engagement and take steps to enhance staff morale. Understanding motivation requires an awareness of fundamental human nature, which can be both complex and straightforward (Usmonovich, 2021). Recognizing and appreciating these aspects is essential for successful employee motivation, effective management, and organizational success.\n\nThirdly, a business is unlikely to achieve its goals if its employees are not fully committed. When employees lose interest in their work, organizations will experience a corresponding decline in effort, innovation, and productivity. Leadership that fails to address these issues promptly jeopardizes the organization’s performance, as well as their own positions, as the firm relies on them to ensure that employees consistently perform at high levels (Usmonovich, 2021). Therefore, managers must be well-versed in motivational strategies and understand their employees' unique characteristics and perspectives to select the appropriate incentives that will effectively motivate them to work together towards achieving the organization’s objectives.",
    "This tote epitomizes the ideal solution for mothers with teenage children who lead active lifestyles yet desire to maintain a sophisticated appearance while managing errands and participating in family activities. The tote is both luxurious and robust, ensuring that the owner’s personal belongings remain well-organized, highly portable, and secure, facilitating a swift transition to outdoor activities.\n\n**Product Selection**\n\nSurvey data indicates that the preferred brands among the target demographic include Chanel, Pucci, and Kate Spade. This audience gravitates towards items where quality aligns with price, yet straddles the line between justified luxury and ostentatious costs. To substantiate the tote’s high-end price, employing premium leather and incorporating additional pockets for organized storage—an often overlooked feature in luxury bags—could be advantageous. As the survey reveals, the target audience predominantly favors shoulder bags or totes, thus, offering an extra shoulder strap would enhance the product’s perceived value.\n\nThe survey also indicates that most participants own between three and five bags, suggesting a preference for versatile bags suited to various occasions over a broad selection of different styles. Consequently, the optimal choice is a black leather bag, sized 9×11 inches, with a production cost of $36.\n\n**Pricing**\n\nSurvey results reveal that the majority of the target audience can comfortably afford a price range of $300 to $700, with a preference for online shopping. Considering the income levels of the target demographic, setting a price within the higher mid-range is likely to attract more interest as it justifies the quality without the exorbitance associated with luxury items. Comparatively, the Ralph Lauren Carlyle Mini Leather Zip Tote Bag, priced at $195, stands as a close mid-range competitor. Therefore, pricing the new product at approximately $250 would offer a fair value to discerning customers. This price point also allows for additional revenue for Buhi, which can be invested in premium accessories and packaging to enhance the bag’s luxurious appeal.",
    "Marx’s thesis on the fetishism of commodities examines society’s inclination to attribute value to commodities based on the labor invested in their production, resulting in the domination of these products over individuals. Moreover, this fetishism influences social interactions between consumers and producers: valued objects are exchanged independently for their respective purposes. Such exchanges occur irrespective of human needs or decisions (Ritzer, 2011). It is important to note that the term fetishism in this context does not imply any sexual connotations; rather, it describes society’s propensity to adhere to the aforementioned principles.\n\nIn contemporary society, we have similarly fetishized technological trends, as suggested by Marx’s thesis. For instance, Apple products are highly esteemed for their perceived “high quality” and “accessibility.” Despite the sometimes questionable ethics of the labor involved in their production, this labor contributes positively to the brand’s overall image. The extensive effort and numerous workers dedicated to manufacturing these items enhance their value independently of their actual quality. Consequently, the product’s value is largely dependent on societal perception and marketing strategies rather than its intrinsic worth. Additionally, the workers essential to the brand’s success also become commodities, as discussed in the Manifesto of the Communist Party (Marx & Engels, 1818-1883). In this manner, although independent of one another, all major components of the modern socio-economic system become disconnected from their inherent value.\n\nMarx’s thesis, however, does not adequately address how a commodity derives its value solely from the labor involved in its production. This omission could be seen as a significant drawback, as it overlooks a crucial perspective that could facilitate a transformation of society’s materialistic values. Another aspect not covered in Marx’s work pertains to the inherent characteristics of commodities and the reasons some are valued more highly than others. Nevertheless, the Manifesto of the Communist Party and Marx’s thesis provide a robust foundation for analyzing modern socio-economic relations.",
    "Mary Breckinridge, born February 17, 1881, in Memphis, Tennessee, dedicated her life to helping people and improving nursing and medical research despite facing many personal tragedies. Raised in various places due to her father's career, she decided to become a nurse in 1904 after the death of her first husband. She later remarried and had two children who both died shortly after birth. Following these losses, Mary left her second husband, volunteered as a nurse in World War I, and committed to saving lives.\n\nAfter the war, Mary furthered her education and trained as a midwife in England. In 1925, she founded the Frontier Nursing Service (FNS) in Kentucky, which greatly reduced maternal and infant mortality. She is renowned for introducing nurse-midwifery to the United States. Her work continues to influence nursing and midwifery education, with the FNS School of Midwifery and Family Nursing educating students worldwide on her models of rural health and social service.\n\nMary Breckinridge's contributions to nursing are profound, and her resilience in the face of personal loss is inspiring.",
    "Introducing new levels of nursing education has made the field more complex. Traditionally, nursing schools offered Bachelor’s degrees, teaching the basic skills needed for the job. Nowadays, aspiring nurses can also pursue Master’s programs to further enhance their abilities. This raises questions about the value of advanced degrees.\n\nMaster’s programs in nursing are crucial for healthcare today. Bachelor’s degrees cover the basics, providing fundamental knowledge and skills, and are sufficient for creating competent nurses. Therefore, a Bachelor’s degree alone is not an “incomplete” education.\n\nHowever, Master’s programs take nursing to the next level. They focus on how nurses think, fostering critical thinking and decision-making skills needed in tough situations. This adds a leadership aspect, enabling nurses to participate in healthcare decisions and understand social issues (Bryant-Moore et al., 2018).\n\nAdditionally, a Master’s in nursing enhances emotional intelligence, which is vital for patient-centered care. Nurses learn to analyze cases objectively and connect emotionally with patients (Cassano et al., 2020). Moreover, these programs improve scientific research skills, helping nurses contribute to a better future healthcare system.\n\nIn summary, Master’s programs build on basic skills by adding cognitive, emotional, and research abilities, shaping nursing leaders in the community.",
    "Mearsheimer (2014) argues that the dynamics of power poles fundamentally drive the likelihood of war in modern Europe. He posits that a multipolar system fosters rivalry due to uneven power distribution among states, which leads to instability as countries' relationships oscillate between hostility and friendliness. These swift changes create an environment ripe for constant conflict and inhibit accurate assessments of adversaries' capabilities and intentions.\n\nIn an unbalanced multipolarity, where a hegemon seeks maximum power, other states respond with heightened aggression out of fear. Conversely, Mearsheimer (2014) contends that wars were infrequent under a bipolar order in modern Europe because the balance of power between two dominant states fostered stability and mutual understanding.\n\nHowever, Mearsheimer's framework faces challenges in today's context where defining the world order is complex. Contemporary multipolarity intertwines with elements of bipolarity, making the modern global structure unique and multifaceted. As a result, attributing the causes of military conflicts to a single system is inadequate.\n\nWhile Mearsheimer's analysis remains logical, he questions its relevance due to the presence of nuclear weapons during the bipolar era. Absent in multipolar times, nuclear weapons represent a significant force that arguably deterred war between 1945 and 1990. Thus, the fear of nuclear annihilation, rather than the balance of power, may be the more decisive factor in preventing conflict.",
    "Melanoma is one of those cancers that’s been showing up more often, but luckily, it's usually caught early. Not too long ago, if melanoma had spread, treatment options were pretty dismal, and things looked grim for many patients. But, over the past decade, things have really turned around thanks to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Now, folks with stage II and III melanoma have a much better shot at staying in remission for a long time. \n\nModern melanoma treatments are giving a lot of hope to many people. Innovations like checkpoint inhibitors and adjuvant therapy have been game changers. For instance, new studies show that using drugs like anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD1 immune checkpoint inhibitors, along with combination BRAF/MEK inhibitors for certain genetic mutations, has significantly boosted survival rates and helped some patients stay in remission even after stopping treatment.\n\nThis means that patients with stage IIA through IIC melanoma, like Mr. B., could enjoy a long period of remission with the right treatment course. Even when in remission, it's a good idea to stay healthy with adjuvant therapies. A decade ago, these additional treatments weren't seen as very effective for earlier stage melanoma because of the harsh side effects of treatments like interferon-α2b (IFN). Many doctors didn't trust them much because of these issues. \n\nBut over time, adjuvant therapies have earned their place in cancer treatment. For someone like Mr. B., adjuvant therapy might have even kept his biopsy from showing stage II melanoma again.",
    "Although the term \"mentoring\" may be relatively novel within church communities, the practice has long been prevalent in Christian circles. Churches have often employed methods like spiritual coaching, directorship, discipleship, and friendship in less formal ways, highlighting the need for standardized skills and approaches for mentors to improve outcomes. According to Mallison (1998), Christian coaching involves nurturing disciples and leaders through sound instruction and encouragement rooted in God's will and biblical teachings. Mallison defines Christian mentoring as “a dynamic, intentional relationship of trust in which one person enables another to maximize the grace of God in their life and service” (Mallison, 1998, p. 8). He asserts that mentorship is essential for Christian growth and emphasizes the importance of caring for others' spiritual development. Christian mentoring incorporates various spiritual elements, with the Bible serving as the core guide.\n\nMallison presents Jesus as the ultimate mentoring model and argues that Christians should be invested in the spiritual and personal development of others, as Christianity is inherently relational and community-oriented. He underscores the concepts of community and interdependence, contrasting these with the idea of a Christian living in isolation as \"a pious particle\" (Mallison, 1998, p. 34). However, he also contends that no matter how well-implemented the principles and components are, Christian mentoring is ineffective without a sincere desire for the mentee's spiritual advancement.\n\nFor those aiming at deeper spiritual growth, mentorship and an engagement in others' development are crucial. For example, Christian fellowships should assign reliable and sincere individuals to mentor new believers due to their dependability and genuine concern for their mentees' progress (Mallison, 1998). The publication highlights the importance of developing a well-structured and biblically inspired coaching program, suggesting that such models should cultivate disciples and leaders committed to spreading the gospel. Nevertheless, the book does face critiques, including its sole reliance on the Bible for analysis and limited exploration of the dynamics between spiritual friends, directors, and mentors, as well as the absence of discussion on the potential for mentor abuse. Mallison reinforces his perspectives by drawing comparisons with other works and extensively integrating biblical insights. An arising question from the publication is how the Christian mentoring model can address and rectify harmful coaching practices.",
    "The study of rhetorical tools used by public personalities in their speeches is a valuable field of research. It enables people to understand how rhetorical elements can be effectively employed. This paper examines Michelle Obama’s opening remarks at the White House Convention on Food Marketing to Children. The core message of the First Lady’s speech was to highlight the need to curb the advertising of unhealthy food to minors.\n\nMichelle Obama primarily used logical and emotional appeals in her speech. The first rhetorical tool, logic, involves providing justification and reasons for specific actions or events. Obama cited data indicating that \"between 2008 and 2011, obesity rates among low-income preschoolers dropped in 19 states and territories\" (Read Michelle Obama’s Speech on Food Marketing para. 10). This statistic underscores the importance of promoting healthy lifestyles among children through media reforms.\n\nThe second essential rhetorical element in her speech is the emotional appeal. Obama stated, “while we have made important progress, when one in three kids is still on track to develop diabetes, and when diet has now surpassed smoking” (Read Michelle Obama’s Speech on Food Marketing para. 11). This highlights the continued risks children face despite previous achievements and aims to evoke an emotional response from the audience.\n\nIn conclusion, this analysis focused on Michelle Obama’s speech concerning the negative impact of media on healthy habits among children. To effectively convey her message, Obama utilized logical and emotional rhetoric. These elements strengthened her argument, provided clarity, and enhanced the persuasive impact of her speech.",
    "Globalization has significantly influenced geopolitical and cultural practices in recent decades. The Internet has connected people worldwide, fostering a shared culture that includes diverse traditions. However, stronger national cultures can overshadow weaker ones, leading to rising nationalism among less dominant cultures. American cultural influence often causes indifference toward local cultures and can threaten the sovereignty of smaller communities. While healthy nationalism preserves cultural and political independence, radical nationalism leads to conflict and hampers globalization. Thus, globalization should be viewed as a natural evolution of humanity, with both positive and negative aspects. The world is now highly interconnected, enabling rapid access to global news, music, and literature, necessitating that society and governments address the challenges of radical nationalism.",
    "There is no simple answer to what it means to be human. For some, it means being independent and controlling their personal lives, while for others, it involves embracing the refinements of civilization, such as wearing clothes and going to work—activities that distinguish us from animals. The complexity of defining how people wish to live is evident, as everyone has unique requirements, dreams, and perspectives on this matter.\n\nThis essay reflects on the On Being podcast to explore these questions. In the podcast, Thich Nhat Hanh articulates why it is essential for people to embrace their humanity. According to him, “we have to remain human to be able to understand and to be compassionate\" (Onbeing.org 30:53–30:58). The monk also asserts that being human involves having the right to make mistakes, but not the “right to continue making mistakes” (Onbeing.org 31:15–31:20). Therefore, being human means being mindful, responsible, and open-hearted—in essence, being humane.\n\nPeople live in a world of violence and terror and often fail to communicate effectively (Onbeing.org). As a result, they struggle to understand what constitutes a genuine way of living. From Thich Nhat Hanh's insights, it can be inferred that people desire to live without anger, to live mindfully, and to control their emotions. However, achieving this way of living can be challenging for the average modern person.\n\nOverall, the podcast is tremendously inspiring as it addresses the essence of being human, the problems people face in the chaotic modern world, and ways to overcome them. Thich Nhat Hanh presents himself as a conscious and thoughtful individual whose ideas merit serious consideration. Although I do not share the Buddhist worldview, I deeply admire Thich Nhat Hanh's personality, as he has inspired me to learn more about mindfulness practices.",
    "\"The Passing of Traditional Societies\" draws on empirical data from fieldwork and interviews conducted over a decade in Turkey, Lebanon, Syria, Egypt, Jordan, and Iran. Lerner argues that all societies, in their journey toward modernization, follow a path first set by Western countries that completed this process earlier. However, Lerner asserts that this \"Western model\" is, in fact, a global model, named as such only due to historical circumstances. The countries of the North Atlantic were pioneers in secularization, urbanization, and industrialization. \n\nIn analyzing the modernization of lifestyles with empirical data, Lerner focuses on population mobility, the spread of literacy, and the influence of mass media. He highlights challenges to modernization, notably ethnocentrism, as significant barriers to progress. Lerner states, \"From the West came the stimuli which undermined traditional society in the Middle East; for the reconstruction of a modern society that will operate efficiently\" (Lerner 47). He contrasts societies and suggests that an emphasis on cultural identity can impede progress.\n\nI believe that the concept of modernization aimed at addressing the transition from \"backwardness\" to \"modernity\" was a product of the post-World War II era. Built on numerous simplifications, modernization theory interprets the historical process as linear and unidirectional (Dunmire 23). The paradigm proposed by Lerner fails to account for the developmental principles of many countries, such as China, Russia, or Cuba, making it less relevant today.",
    "The clothing industry is a vibrant example of monopolistic competition. Numerous clothing firms constantly vie with each other, offering similar yet distinct products. These companies gain a competitive edge through creative branding and catchy advertisements (Davis and Özgür, 4). One key strategy they employ is product differentiation. For clothing brands, this can mean unique designs, superior material quality, and varied pricing. Advertisements highlight these differences through physical attributes like color, design, elasticity, and size options (Davis and Özgür, 7). They also emphasize intangible benefits such as money-back guarantees, exceptional quality, free delivery, and long-lasting wear.\n\nOn the other hand, steel manufacturing showcases an oligopolistic market structure. Here, a handful of powerful firms dominate the landscape, setting prices and trends for smaller competitors to follow (Ritz 185). These industry giants carve out their territory by optimizing product quality, adjusting prices strategically, and showcasing unique product features through advertising. In such a market, if a leading firm cuts prices, others don't necessarily follow suit. Instead, they enhance their products to justify higher prices (Ritz 187). These elite companies maintain their dominance by setting lofty standards—producing top-quality products, commanding higher prices, and manufacturing in large volumes (Ritz 189). This high barrier to entry discourages smaller firms from challenging the industry's titans, ensuring the market remains under their control.",
    "Moral relativism asserts that morality lacks any absolute standard and is instead shaped by situations, cultures, and experiences. Conversely, moral universalism roots ethical truth in human nature, empathy, and the necessity of reasoned argument. Though these concepts oppose each other, moral universalism appears more credible.\n\nFirstly, arguments supporting moral relativism are logically inconsistent, as they eventually endorse a universal moral framework, which is essentially moral universalism. Secondly, the claim that different cultures hold different values still relies on some absolute standards, reinforcing moral universalism.\n\nMoral universalism posits a universal ethical system applicable to all communities, regardless of cultural or individual differences. This viewpoint is supported by the observation that viable moral codes universally uphold respect for life, health, property, and dignity.\n\nMoral universalism is more plausible than moral relativism. The latter focuses on exceptions rather than rules, while human nature leads to similar moral codes globally, such as the prohibition of murder. Additionally, if morality were entirely individual, it would be impossible to regulate human interactions effectively.",
    "“Interpreter of Maladies” introduces the reader to a disintegrating world of a dysfunctional family. In the novel, Mr. Das evokes both sympathy and mild annoyance, which can transform into disdain as his character unfolds. Although initially perceived as benevolent and sympathetic, his evident inability to emotionally connect with his wife or children suggests a need for further development, which ultimately never occurs.\n\nAt first glance, Mr. Das is an easily relatable and empathetic character due to his kind nature. He is largely benevolent and kind-hearted throughout the novel, never aggressive or unkind to his wife, with confrontations often initiated by her: “’But they’re harmless,’ Mr. Das said” (Lahiri). However, Mr. Das should not be seen as immediately redeemable. Upon closer inspection, his unwillingness to engage with his wife or children becomes apparent. For instance, when Mr. Kapasi starts conversing with the couple, Mr. Das chooses to read a book instead: “Mr. Das was absorbed by his tour book, so it seemed like a private conversation between Mr. Kapasi and Mrs. Das” (Lahiri). This behavior highlights his detachment from his wife and children, creating a further divide in their relationship.\n\nMr. Das' failure to acknowledge and address the issues in his family represents a significant obstacle in his character development. As a result, he remains stagnant throughout the novel, trapped in a state of blissful ignorance. His intentional disregard for the unhappiness of his family makes him less sympathetic than initially perceived. His inability to recognize the alienation between himself, his wife, and his children gradually diminishes the reader's empathy, revealing him as deeply flawed.\n\nAlthough the problems in Mr. Das' perception of his marriage and children are understandable and humanizing, his inability or unwillingness to address them leads to bitter disappointment for the reader. Thus, with his complex and contradictory nature, Mr. Das' character arc teaches an important lesson about the need for introspection and acknowledging reality.",
    "The article gives an overview of existing literature on methods and criteria used to evaluate and choose suppliers, which is crucial for the success of a manufacturing company. It particularly highlights a shift in the industry from focusing on operational efficiency to valuing strategic partnerships. The article asserts that a proper supplier assessment approach is key to a company’s growth and progress. It then discusses various methods for solving the issues in Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) for supplier selection. Common methods include mathematical models, the Simple Multi-Attribute Rating Technique (SMART), the Analytic Network Process (ANP), the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), and linear programming. For instance, DEA assesses a supplier system as efficient or inefficient based on certain criteria, while mathematical programming models allow complex comparisons between suppliers to identify the best one based on cost and other factors. The article further compares these methods by their popularity in the literature, noting that DEA is the most mentioned approach (30%), followed by mathematical programming (17%), AHP (15%), and case-based reasoning. These methodologies dominate the MCDM approaches. Understanding this distribution is important to choose the best methods for supplier assessment and selection. The article also states suppliers should be evaluated based on inputs at the strategic, functional, and operational levels. DEA, mathematical programming, and AHP are recommended for identifying optimal suppliers, with AHP particularly noted for its consistency.",
    "Ancient Rome was highly multicultural due to its extensive empire, which integrated local populations and cultures. The Roman population exhibited significant genetic diversity, more akin to Mediterranean states than Western Europe (Thomsen, 2019). Cultures under Roman rule included the Gauls, Greeks, Syrians, Egyptians, Lebanese, and Persians, among others. This cultural diversity contributed to Rome's success by assimilating various ethnic and national identities into its own traditions and practices. The Pax Romana, a 200-year period of peace, allowed multiple cultures to coexist harmoniously under one government. While Rome imposed certain values on conquered regions, it largely permitted local customs, religions, laws, and taxation to continue (Brooks, 2019). Ancient Greece, heavily influencing Roman culture, provided a foundation in architecture, art, philosophy, politics, science, literature, law, economics, and military tactics. The Etruscans also significantly influenced Rome, especially in its early military and expansionist strategies, facilitating the transition of Greek culture into Roman society (Brooks, 2019).",
    "From ancient times, humans have used symbols and myths to express transcendent realities and transmit them to future generations. Today, brands like Versace and Lamborghini use mythology to convey their product's power and allure. Versace's logo, designed in 1978, features Medusa's head, symbolizing beauty and simplicity, while Lamborghini's iconic bull represents strength and endurance. I prefer the myth of Prometheus, who defied Zeus by giving fire and knowledge to humanity, symbolizing the triumph of good over evil. Despite being punished, Prometheus was eventually freed by Heracles.",
    "McDonald's filed a lawsuit in the United States against its former CEO, Steve Easterbrook, after uncovering that he had multiple consensual sexual relationships with employees in the year before his departure, which he concealed. Easterbrook misled authorities and destroyed evidence of his actions, prioritizing his own interests over those of McDonald's. Shareholders have also filed a lawsuit against the company for allegedly prioritizing speed over thoroughness in addressing the issue and attempting to sweep misconduct under the rug. Negligent hiring and retention reflect an employer's responsibility not to hire or retain employees likely to engage in behavior that could harm others or expose the company to liability (Monteiro et al., 2019). If a supervisor knows or should have known about such risks, the company can be held liable for the employee's actions (dos Santos et al., 2017). \n\nThis discussion aims to examine workplace negligence, the most common tort. If McDonald's fails to properly vet an employee before hiring and that employee causes harm, the corporation may be held responsible. For example, McDonald's should thoroughly check all previous work experiences, certification credentials, and current professional affiliations before hiring an executive chef (Rushchenko et al., 2020). If the chef repeatedly makes culinary mistakes that endanger diners' health, the fast-food giant could be liable for not conducting a basic background check. This underscores the importance of criminal history checks. If an employee assaults coworkers or customers and investigation reveals a history of violent behavior, the company may be held accountable. Furthermore, if an employer knows about an employee’s dangerous, unpredictable, or inappropriate behavior but fails to dismiss them, McDonald's could be liable for jeopardizing the safety of others.",
    "Neil deGrasse Tyson stands out as one of the most fascinating figures I admire. As a renowned astrophysicist and planetary scientist, his insights and knowledge, shared across various platforms, are both mind-opening and occasionally shocking. Born in 1958, Tyson boasts degrees from prestigious institutions like Harvard, the University of Texas at Austin, and Columbia University. Appointed by the president in the early 2000s to serve on the Commission on the Future of the United States Aerospace Industry, his credentials further solidify his expertise.\n\nMy interest in the mysteries of the cosmos led me to watch numerous documentaries, including \"Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey,\" narrated by Tyson. This series only scratches the surface of his extensive knowledge. If given the opportunity to converse with him, I would delve into his views on extraterrestrial life and possible classified information at NASA. These topics intrigue me, especially the notion that Earth might not be the sole cradle of life.\n\nNeil deGrasse Tyson's profound understanding of the universe and his ability to communicate complex concepts inspire me deeply. A conversation with him promises new perspectives and unexplored theories about the cosmos. His wealth of knowledge and thought-provoking opinions make him an endlessly compelling figure.",
    "It is imperative to acknowledge that brain tissue represents one of the most sophisticated and intricate structures within the human body, possessing a markedly limited capacity for healing and regeneration. The focal point of the proposed research is to evaluate the mechanisms through which neural stem cells replace and differentiate into neurons and other cerebral cell types, with the intention of utilizing these processes for therapeutic purposes. Neural stem cells present a promising therapeutic intervention to decelerate or arrest the aging process, owing to their rejuvenation and differentiation potentials.\n\n**Organizational Plan:**\n1. Introduction\n2. Literature Review\n3. Brain Aging\n4. Neural Stem Cell Differentiation\n5. Regulation of Differentiation\n6. Therapeutic Approaches\n7. Discussion\n8. Conclusion\n\n**Literature Review**\n\n*Part 1:* Preliminary research indicates the presence of a complex regulatory milieu involving GABA signaling. Diverse signaling molecules, such as Sonic hedgehog, fibroblast growth factor 2, and glutamate, play critical roles in the neurogenesis within the ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ). The subgranular zone (SGZ) is another vital neurogenic region in the adult human brain, with regulatory mechanisms that differ markedly from those in the V-SVZ.\n\n*Part 2:* Notably, one pivotal source asserts that \"V-SVZ NSCs are regulated by local signals from their immediate neighbors, as well as by neurotransmitters and factors secreted by distant neurons, the choroid plexus, and vasculature” (Obernier & Alvarez-Buylla, 2019, p. 1). This indicates that cells located at a distance secrete a broad spectrum of signaling molecules to orchestrate the generation, differentiation, and regeneration of neural stem cells.\n\n**Schedule for the Completion of Tasks:**",
    "The first English colonies in America were New England and the Chesapeake Bay. In Chesapeake Bay, the Virginia Company aimed to colonize for profit, initially seeking precious metals but later focusing on tobacco, employing young, poor Englishmen for labor (Corbett et al., 2022). In contrast, New England colonies were formed to escape persecution and create a virtuous society, with settlers arriving as families and establishing self-sustaining farms and communities (Corbett et al., 2022). Religion influenced both regions: New England sought to create a perfect Protestant community, while in the Chesapeake Bay, the Anglican Church facilitated relations with Native Americans, exemplified by John Rolfe's marriage to Pocahontas (Corbett et al., 2022; Tsukada, 2020).",
    "A recent innovation that has made its debut in the market is the electric scooter. It swiftly garnered popularity because it allowed individuals to travel quickly across different parts of the city. Additionally, people spent less time commuting as they were not held up by traffic lights (Hagiu and Wright 1527). Its edge over competitors, however, lies in its environmental friendliness and minimal energy requirements for upkeep. In essence, these scooters consume less energy to function and are therefore more eco-friendly than cars (Hagiu and Wright 1527). Notably, certain electric scooters can be powered by solar energy; thus, they can be described as simple yet affordable devices facilitating rapid movement. These advantages have led to a growing number of people opting for electric scooters, boosting their market popularity in a short span of time.\n\nA product poised for gradual market expansion is wireless headphones. They are increasingly popular because every smartphone manufacturer is venturing into producing this accessory. Furthermore, their competitive edge is their compact size and ease of use (Hagiu and Wright 1527). Despite being more expensive than standard headphones, they boast longer battery life and greater durability. They have cemented their market position due to their seamless connectivity with phones at a distance, which is highly convenient in modern times. Additionally, consumers purchasing new phones often choose to buy headphones from the same brand (Hagiu and Wright 1527). Hence, the aforementioned benefits have led to an increase in the variety and popularity of wireless headphones in the market.",
    "Given the current extensive range of species, and the emerging reports concerning those on the brink of extinction due to environmental changes, one might think that finding new animals is no longer feasible. Nonetheless, new species are still being uncovered regularly, with the latest remarkable discovery being a fitting example. Specifically, the Nimba myotis, also referred to as the fuzzy orange bat or Myotis nimbaensis, was identified as a new species this year (Simmons et al., 2021). With orange fur accented by black pigmentation, Nimba Myotis is a unique bat specimen. This creature prefers natural caves for its habitat and resting place. Similar to other bats, Nimba Myotis employs laryngeal echolocation to detect and capture prey in darkness. However, due to limited research on this species, its diet remains largely unknown (Simmons et al., 2021). Overall, this bat stands out as a distinct specimen within its group. The species falls under the Animalia kingdom, specifically among mammals in the Chiroptera order and the Vespertilionidae family (Simmons et al., 2021). The main justification for its classification in the animal kingdom is that Nimba Myotis is a mammal. Moreover, this particular species reproduces through sexual means, unlike members of other kingdoms, and is multicellular (Simmons et al., 2021). Additionally, the absence of cell walls in the cells of Nimba Myotis further supports its classification within the animal kingdom. Therefore, the bat is rightly categorized as an animal, particularly a mammal. Furthermore, it should be noted that as a bat, Nimba Myotis represents the second-largest order of mammals, following rodents (Simmons et al., 2021). In summary, the discovery of Nimba Myotis has significantly enhanced our understanding of bat species as a whole.",
    "Marine microbes exist in massive amounts, including six main types of nitrite-oxidizing bacteria: Nitrotoga, Nitrospira, Nitrolancetus, Nitrospina, Nitrobacter, and Nitrococcus (Han 2). Nitrobacter is particularly interesting as it plays a crucial role in plant nutrition. It converts nitrite to nitrate, facilitating nitrification along with Nitrosomonas (Han 3). Nitrification, a key process occurring in soil, impacts various natural factors and is vital in the nitrogen cycle, turning atmospheric nitrogen into usable forms. Nitrobacter's oxidation activity helps maintain soil fertility and microorganism diversity, making it an essential and fascinating species among nitrite-oxidizing bacteria.",
    "Millions of people around the world are struggling with mental health issues like manias, phobias, and panic attacks, which can be incredibly exhausting and overwhelming. One common and long-lasting mental health condition is obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). This involves having persistent, unwanted thoughts and the uncontrollable urge to perform certain behaviors. Let's break down what's happening with OCD using the four D's: Distress, Dysfunction, Danger, and Deviance.\n\n* **Distress:** People with OCD often feel overwhelmed by the relentless, intrusive thoughts in their minds, and the compulsive actions they take to try to calm their anxiety. These unwanted, persistent thoughts can create a lot of anxiety and stress. Even though they know these behaviors are unreasonable, they can’t just stop. This leads to high levels of distress and makes life really tough.\n\n* **Dysfunction:** OCD can seriously disrupt daily life. Obsessive thoughts can interfere with everyday activities, causing panic that makes it hard to focus or complete tasks. Compulsive behaviors, like needing to check things multiple times or perform rituals, can take up a lot of time—sometimes even hours. This kind of dysfunction can make it difficult to maintain a regular routine.\n\n* **Danger:** For some people with OCD, the condition can become so overwhelming that they might feel like hurting themselves. They might try to deal with their obsessive thoughts in harmful ways, such as hitting themselves to get rid of an unwanted image in their mind. While it’s more common for people with OCD to fear harming others, they rarely act on these fears. The danger is mostly to themselves.\n\n* **Deviance:** Because of the unusual thoughts and behaviors caused by OCD, people with this condition can seem different from what’s considered normal. It’s challenging to pinpoint how much they deviate from the norm, but the constant anxiety, stress, and fear they experience significantly impact their lives. Getting professional help is crucial for managing these symptoms and improving their quality of life.\n\nIf you or someone you know is dealing with OCD, it's important to seek help from a healthcare professional. They can provide support and strategies to manage the condition effectively.",

    "In the survey titled \"The Effect of Work Relationships on Organizational Culture and Commitment,\" an impressive 89% of respondents shared that communication with colleagues positively impacts their quality of life (Suhardi, 2020). It also revealed that having at least one friend at work makes people feel more connected to the company and more inclined to stay. Feeling connected to colleagues boosts employees' interest and involvement in their work. Chatting with coworkers helps people feel more comfortable expressing their ideas and feedback.\n\nA fascinating experiment by scientists from the University of Michigan, called \"Friends (and Sometimes Enemies) With Cognitive Benefits: What Types of Social Interactions Boost Executive Functioning?\" explored this further. Participants were divided into two groups: the first group spent 10 minutes getting to know each other, while the second group engaged in debates on a specific topic. Afterwards, all participants completed several cognitive tasks. Interestingly, those in the first group, who had relaxed and friendly interactions, performed best on the tasks. They showed significant improvements in executive functions, such as planning, concentration, prioritization, and organization—skills crucial for work.",
    "Osteoarthritis is a global disease often poorly managed within the healthcare system. It stands as one of the leading causes of disability among the elderly, causing pain, loss of function, and reduced quality of life. On a societal scale, the condition is estimated to cost $303 billion annually in medical expenses and lost wages (Abramoff & Caldera, 2020). Addressing this chronic and severe illness necessitates ongoing efforts to reduce its incidence, pain, and loss of function. Osteoarthritis is characterized by the degeneration of articular cartilage, which becomes significantly damaged over time. Articular cartilage is the smooth tissue at the ends of long bones and within intervertebral discs, providing a low-friction surface capable of bearing heavy loads. Despite having a long half-life, cartilage repairs slowly, if at all, even from minor injuries. Although the cartilage is primarily affected, the entire joint, including the synovium, joint ligaments, and subchondral bone, is impacted. Osteoarthritis is often underestimated despite its considerable personal, economic, and societal costs. Though it frequently coexists with heart disease, diabetes, and mental health issues, exacerbating the morbidity and mortality of these conditions, it is not included in global strategic plans for noncommunicable diseases. Patients and healthcare providers may fall into therapeutic nihilism, mistakenly believing osteoarthritis is an inevitable part of aging with no effective treatments (Abramoff & Caldera, 2020). Often, individuals affected are misinformed about available treatments. Current healthcare strategies may range from neglecting crucial interventions such as exercise, weight loss, and education to using expensive, unproven medications for advanced stages of the disease. This issue is the most intriguing yet unfortunate aspect of both the article and the perception of the condition. I think rehabilitation counseling, which integrates physical and psychological support, could significantly benefit patients with osteoarthritis in managing its various impacts.",
    "Outreach Chicago is an organization dedicated to providing aid and services to homeless individuals and those underserved by existing institutions. The primary mission of the organization is to offer support and essential items to facilitate successful reintegration into society. To apply deductive reasoning, we begin with the general hypothesis that Outreach Chicago helps people (Adler & Clark, 2015). Observations support this as the organization distributes meals, hygiene kits, coats, blankets, socks, and undergarments to those in need. The official site of Outreach Chicago provides exact figures for each type of aid, allowing us to conclude that they have indeed been offering diverse necessities to people since 2011.\n\nOutreach Chicago reports that the average poverty rate in its target area is 34% among adults and 51% among children (Outreach Chicago, 2022). To use inductive reasoning, one could compare the organization's data with other statistical sources to verify the currency and accuracy of the reported poverty rates. The organization operates in several locations: Chicago Heights, Chicago, Cicero, Dolton, and Harvey (Outreach Chicago, 2022). According to Welfare Info, the poverty rates among adults in these areas for 2017 were 26.4%, 20.6%, 19.8%, 26.6%, and 35.6% respectively (Poverty Illinois, 2022). The average poverty rate across these locations is 25.8%, suggesting that Outreach Chicago may have used older data or cited figures from the most impoverished city, Harvey.\n\nA qualitative research question could investigate whether the services provided by Outreach Chicago meet the needs of its recipients. This research might involve interviewing clients to gauge their impressions of the services and the usability of the provided goods. The hypothesis would be that Outreach Chicago supplies essential items for its clients. Feedback from such studies could improve service delivery by identifying unnecessary items or suggesting changes.\n\nFor a quantitative study, the research question could be whether the overall satisfaction level of clients exceeds 50%. To measure this, clients would complete satisfaction surveys. The hypothesis would be that Outreach Chicago meets the expectations of more than 50% of its clients. This research could help the organization assess and enhance the effectiveness of its services.",
    "Overpopulation in urban areas has emerged as one of the most pressing issues of our era, encompassing both environmental and social dimensions. The city, with finite capacity for expansion, cannot indefinitely support increasing numbers of inhabitants while providing adequate employment opportunities. This phenomenon also exacerbates the ecological burden. Uncontrolled urban sprawl contributes to unchecked pollution and the escalation of poverty. Nevertheless, there are several measures that governments can enact to mitigate this challenge.\n\nFirstly, overpopulation in cities results in congestion and traffic jams, leading to significant air quality issues. Urban atmospheric pollution is acute, primarily originating from road transport, which emits substantial quantities of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. Secondly, poverty poses a major problem. Disadvantaged individuals from rural areas often migrate to cities in search of better employment prospects, motivated by the need to support their families yet frequently lacking the necessary education for well-paying jobs. These individuals typically join the service sector and endure discrimination, poverty, and substandard working conditions.\n\nAdditionally, the waste generated by residents in overcrowded cities becomes challenging to manage. Many European nations have addressed this issue through the implementation of separate waste collection systems, with segregation of waste occurring even within households. Some of this waste is recycled, while the remainder is incinerated at waste-to-energy plants.\n\nIn conclusion, addressing traffic and air pollution requires greater reliance on public transportation rather than private vehicles. The government should prioritize the construction of additional roadways and the enhancement of public transport infrastructure. While poverty is currently at its lowest levels in human history, ongoing efforts and trends suggest that we will continue to make significant strides in the battle against poverty in the foreseeable future.",
    "The Balboa, named after the legendary Spanish explorer Vasco Núñez de Balboa, stands as the cornerstone of Panama’s economy. Equally valued with the U.S. Dollar, which has been in legal circulation in Panama for decades, the Balboa brings stability to the nation's financial landscape. This unique currency setup shields Panama from hyperinflation and makes it a beacon of investment and tourism. By leveraging the robust U.S. dollar, Panama enjoys reduced susceptibility to volatile exchange rates.\n\nThanks to this dollarization, Panama consistently showcases strong inflation control, mitigating global trust shocks though not entirely insulating from real external disturbances (Bakari & Mabrouki, 2017). The blend of monetary policies and a rapidly globalizing banking sector raises the question of what drives Panama’s financial leniency.\n\nStrategically positioned as a vital maritime hub, Panama’s relevance is further underscored by the Panama Canal, where nearly two-thirds of annual transits connect with U.S. destinations (Park et al., 2020). Under recent agreements, almost all U.S. goods—from automotive and commercial products to farming machinery, aircraft components, medical supplies, and eco-friendly items—enter Panama free of duty, with remaining tariffs to be phased out over ten years (Park et al., 2020).\n\nMoreover, as both countries continue to trade agricultural commodities like corn and bananas, the mutually beneficial relationship only strengthens. This symbiotic economic bond sets the stage for Panama's continuous rise as a pivotal player in global trade and commerce."
