    "I have bought several of the Vitality canned dog food products and have found them all to be of good quality. The product looks more like a stew than a processed meat and it smells better. My Labrador is finicky and she appreciates this product better than  most.",
    "Product arrived labeled as Jumbo Salted Peanuts...the peanuts were actually small sized unsalted. Not sure if this was an error or if the vendor intended to represent the product as \"Jumbo\".",
    "This is a confection that has been around a few centuries.  It is a light, pillowy citrus gelatin with nuts - in this case Filberts. And it is cut into tiny squares and then liberally coated with powdered sugar.  And it is a tiny mouthful of heaven.  Not too chewy, and very flavorful.  I highly recommend this yummy treat.  If you are familiar with the story of C.S. Lewis' \"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe\" - this is the treat that seduces Edmund into selling out his Brother and Sisters to the Witch.",
    "If you are looking for the secret ingredient in Robitussin I believe I have found it.  I got this in addition to the Root Beer Extract I ordered (which was good) and made some cherry soda.  The flavor is very medicinal.",
    "Great taffy at a great price.  There was a wide assortment of yummy taffy.  Delivery was very quick.  If your a taffy lover, this is a deal.",
    "I got a wild hair for taffy and ordered this five pound bag. The taffy was all very enjoyable with many flavors: watermelon, root beer, melon, peppermint, grape, etc. My only complaint is there was a bit too much red/black licorice-flavored pieces (just not my particular favorites). Between me, my kids, and my husband, this lasted only two weeks! I would recommend this brand of taffy -- it was a delightful treat.",
    "This saltwater taffy had great flavors and was very soft and chewy.  Each candy was individually wrapped well.  None of the candies were stuck together, which did happen in the expensive version, Fralinger's.  Would highly recommend this candy!  I served it at a beach-themed party and everyone loved it!",
    "This taffy is so good.  It is very soft and chewy.  The flavors are amazing.  I would definitely recommend you buying it.  Very satisfying!!",
    "Right now I'm mostly just sprouting this so my cats can eat the grass. They love it. I rotate it around with Wheatgrass and Rye too",
    "This is a very healthy dog food. Good for their digestion. Also good for small puppies. My dog eats her required amount at every feeding.",
    "I don't know if it's the cactus or the tequila or just the unique combination of ingredients, but the flavour of this hot sauce makes it one of a kind!  We picked up a bottle once on a trip we were on and brought it back home with us and were totally blown away!  When we realized that we simply couldn't find it anywhere in our city we were bummed.<br /><br />Now, because of the magic of the internet, we have a case of the sauce and are ecstatic because of it.<br /><br />If you love hot sauce..I mean really love hot sauce, but don't want a sauce that tastelessly burns your throat, grab a bottle of Tequila Picante Gourmet de Inclan.  Just realize that once you taste it, you will never want to use any other sauce.<br /><br />Thank you for the personal, incredible service!",
    "One of my boys needed to lose some weight and the other didn't.  I put this food on the floor for the chubby guy, and the protein-rich, no by-product food up higher where only my skinny boy can jump.  The higher food sits going stale.  They both really go for this food.  And my chubby boy has been losing about an ounce a week.",
    "My cats have been happily eating Felidae Platinum for more than two years. I just got a new bag and the shape of the food is different. They tried the new food when I first put it in their bowls and now the bowls sit full and the kitties will not touch the food. I've noticed similar reviews related to formula changes in the past. Unfortunately, I now need to find a new food that my cats will eat.",
    "good flavor! these came securely packed... they were fresh and delicious! i love these Twizzlers!",
    "The Strawberry Twizzlers are my guilty pleasure - yummy. Six pounds will be around for a while with my son and I.",
    "My daughter loves twizzlers and this shipment of six pounds really hit the spot. It's exactly what you would expect...six packages of strawberry twizzlers.",
    "I love eating them and they are good for watching TV and looking at movies! It is not too sweet. I like to transfer them to a zip lock baggie so they stay fresh so I can take my time eating them.",
    "I am very satisfied with my Twizzler purchase.  I shared these with others and we have all enjoyed them.  I will definitely be ordering more.",
    "Twizzlers, Strawberry my childhood favorite candy, made in Lancaster Pennsylvania by Y & S Candies, Inc. one of the oldest confectionery Firms in the United States, now a Subsidiary of the Hershey Company, the Company was established in 1845 as Young and Smylie, they also make Apple Licorice Twists, Green Color and Blue Raspberry Licorice Twists, I like them all<br /><br />I keep it in a dry cool place because is not recommended it to put it in the fridge. According to the Guinness Book of Records, the longest Licorice Twist ever made measured 1.200 Feet (370 M) and weighted 100 Pounds (45 Kg) and was made by Y & S Candies, Inc. This Record-Breaking Twist became a Guinness World Record on July 19, 1998. This Product is Kosher! Thank You",
    "Candy was delivered very fast and was purchased at a reasonable price.  I was home bound and unable to get to a store so this was perfect for me.",
    "My husband is a Twizzlers addict.  We've bought these many times from Amazon because we're government employees living overseas and can't get them in the country we are assigned to.  They've always been fresh and tasty, packed well and arrive in a timely manner.",
    "I bought these for my husband who is currently overseas. He loves these, and apparently his staff likes them also.<br />There are generous amounts of Twizzlers in each 16-ounce bag, and this was well worth the price. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GVISJM\">Twizzlers, Strawberry, 16-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)</a>",
    "I can remember buying this candy as a kid and the quality hasn't dropped in all these years. Still a superb product you won't be disappointed with.",
    "I have lived out of the US for over 7 yrs now, and I so miss my Twizzlers!!  When I go back to visit or someone visits me, I always stock up.  All I can say is YUM!<br />Sell these in Mexico and you will have a faithful buyer, more often than I'm able to buy them right now.",

    "The candy is just red , No flavor . Just  plan and chewy .  I would never buy them again",
    "I was so glad Amazon carried these batteries.  I have a hard time finding them elsewhere because they are such a unique size.  I need them for my garage door opener.<br />Great deal for the price.",
    "I got this for my Mum who is not diabetic but needs to watch her sugar intake, and my father who simply chooses to limit unnecessary sugar intake - she's the one with the sweet tooth - they both LOVED these toffees, you would never guess that they're sugar-free and it's so great that you can eat them pretty much guilt free!  i was so impressed that i've ordered some for myself (w dark chocolate) to take to the office so i'll eat them instead of snacking on sugary sweets.<br />These are just EXCELLENT!",

    "I have never been a huge coffee fan. However, my mother purchased this little machine and talked me into trying the Latte Macciato. No Coffee Shop has a better one and I like most of the other products, too (as a usually non-coffee drinker!).<br />The little Dolche Guesto Machine is super easy to use and prepares a really good Coffee/Latte/Cappuccino/etc in less than a minute (if water is heated up). I would recommend the Dolce Gusto to anyone. Too good for the price and I'am getting one myself! :)",
    "This offer is a great price and a great taste, thanks Amazon for selling this product.<br /><br />Staral",
    "McCann's Instant Oatmeal is great if you must have your oatmeal but can only scrape together two or three minutes to prepare it. There is no escaping the fact, however, that even the best instant oatmeal is nowhere near as good as even a store brand of oatmeal requiring stovetop preparation.  Still, the McCann's is as good as it gets for instant oatmeal. It's even better than the organic, all-natural brands I have tried.  All the varieties in the McCann's variety pack taste good.  It can be prepared in the microwave or by adding boiling water so it is convenient in the extreme when time is an issue.<br /><br />McCann's use of actual cane sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup helped me decide to buy this product.  Real sugar tastes better and is not as harmful as the other stuff. One thing I do not like, though, is McCann's use of thickeners.  Oats plus water plus heat should make a creamy, tasty oatmeal without the need for guar gum. But this is a convenience product.  Maybe the guar gum is why, after sitting in the bowl a while, the instant McCann's becomes too thick and gluey.",
    "This is a good instant oatmeal from the best oatmeal brand.  It uses cane sugar instead of high fructouse corn syrup, so not only does it have a better sweetness, but some doctors now say that this form of sugar is better for you.  Great on a cold morning when you don't have time to make McCann's Steel Cut Oats.  The apple cinnamon is the best but the maple and brown sugar or the regular are good too.  Plus they don't require doctoring to actually tell the three flavors apart.",
    "Instant oatmeal can become soggy the minute the water hits the bowl. McCann's Instant Oatmeal holds its texture, has excellent flavor, and is good for you all at the same time. McCann's regular oat meal is excellent, too, but may take a bit longer to prepare than most have time for in the morning. This is the best instant brand I've ever eaten, and a very close second to the non-instant variety.<br /><br />McCann's Instant Irish Oatmeal, Variety Pack of Regular, Apples & Cinnamon, and Maple & Brown Sugar, 10-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)",
    "McCann's Instant Irish Oatmeal, Variety Pack of Regular, Apples & Cinnamon, and Maple & Brown Sugar, 10-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)<br /><br />I'm a fan of the McCann's steel-cut oats, so I thought I'd give the instant variety a try. I found it to be a hardy meal, not too sweet, and great for folks like me (post-bariatric surgery) who need food that is palatable, easily digestible, with fiber but won't make you bloat.",
    "For those of us with celiac disease this product is a lifesaver and what could be better than getting it at almost half the price of the grocery or health food store!  I love McCann's instant oatmeal - all flavors!!!<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Abby",
    "What else do you need to know? Oatmeal, instant (make it with a half cup of low-fat milk and add raisins;nuke for 90 seconds). More expensive than Kroger store brand oatmeal and maybe a little tastier or better texture or something. It's still just oatmeal. Mmm, convenient!",
    "I WAS VISITING MY FRIEND NATE THE OTHER MORNING FOR COFFEE , HE CAME OUT OF HIS STORAGE ROOM WITH ( A PACKET OF McCANNS INSTANT IRISH OATMEAL .) HE SUGGESTED THAT I TRY IT FOR MY OWN USE ,IN MY STASH . SOMETIMES NATE DOSE NOT GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO SAY NO , SO I ENDED UP TRYING THE APPLE AND CINN . FOUND IT TO BE VERY TASTEFULL WHEN MADE WITH WATER OR POWDERED MILK . IT GOES GOOD WITH O.J. AND COFFEE AND A SLICE OF TOAST AND YOUR READY TO TAKE ON THE WORLD...OR THE DAY AT LEAST..

    "The variety packs taste great!<br /><br />I have them every morning. At $0.30 cents per meal, I don't understand why everyone on earth isn't buying this stuff up.<br /><br />Maple and brown sugar is terrific, followed by apples and cinnamon, followed by regular. You don't get tired of the same ole thing, and they taste great.<br /><br />I just boil water from a small pot, empty the packet or 2 in a bowl, pour in boiling water, and watch it expand to 2x its size!<br /><br />Taste really good and takes minutes to prepare.<br /><br />Not sure why everyone on earth isn't this. Convenient, healthy, very quick, excellent quality, and extremely cheap...",
    "McCann's makes oatmeal for every oatmeal connoisseur, whether one likes it from the raw pellet state that cooks for half an hour, to the sloth addled instant, which can be done in the microwave for under three minutes. It's all good, that's for sure, and the beauty of the instant variety is that it is available in different flavors as well as regular.<br />  This variety pack allows different tastes to be explored, as well as giving you a chance to experience the difference between McCann's and other well-known oatmeals. What I personally like about McCann's is that it cooks up thicker and with more body than the top brand here in America. The Apples & Cinnamon, though, tends to be a little liquidy so you may want to experiment with the amount of water you add. In my 1300watt microwave the oatmeal cooks up in about one minute and twenty-seven seconds, so you should also watch that to get a handle on how much time and water to use.<br />  The only bad thing -- if you can consider it a bad thing -- about this offering is that you have to buy in lot so you'll end up with six ten-count boxes. This is good if you have a whole family of oatmeal-eaters, but if you're a single person alone -- well, love oatmeal.",
    "I have McCann's Oatmeal every morning and by ordering it from Amazon I am able to save almost $3.00 per box.<br />It is a great product. Tastes great and very healthy",
    "McCann's Oatmeal is a good quality choice.  Our favorite is the Apples and Cinnamon, but we find that none of these are overly sugary.  For a good hot breakfast in 2 minutes, this is excellent.",
    "We really like the McCann's steel cut oats but find we don't cook it up too often.<br />This tastes much better to me than the grocery store brands and is just as convenient.<br />Anything that keeps me eating oatmeal regularly is a good thing.",
    "This seems a little more wholesome than some of the supermarket brands, but it is somewhat mushy and doesn't have quite as much flavor either.  It didn't pass muster with my kids, so I probably won't buy it again.",
    "Good oatmeal.  I like the apple cinnamon the best.  Though I wouldn't follow the directions on the package since it always comes out too soupy for my taste.  That could just be me since I like my oatmeal really thick to add some milk on top of.",
    "The flavors are good.  However, I do not see any differce between this and Oaker Oats brand - they are both mushy.",
    "I really like the Maple and Brown Sugar flavor. The regular is fine with brown sugar added. The Apples and Cinnamon flavor is OK. This is a very quick, easy and satisfying breakfast and I'll order this brand again, but not the variety. I'll get all Maple and Brown Sugar.",
    "This is the same stuff you can buy at the big box stores.  There is nothing healthy about it.  It is just carbs and sugars.  Save your money and get something that at least has some taste.",
    "This oatmeal is not good. Its mushy, soft, I don't like it. Quaker Oats is the way to go.",
    "Got a free package of these with a bottle of bloody mary mix I bought from the seller, and the advertising worked..lol,  I tried them, and shared them with 2 buddies, and we all loved them...  So im here to buy more, and noticed there were no reviews yet,...  well now there is.  They are Hot,  but not \"burn your mouth forever hot\"  its a nice temp...  Perfect for us..",
    "This wasn't in stock the last time I looked. I had to go to the Vermont Country Store in Weston to find it along with a jaw harp, Cranberry Horseradish Sauce, Fartless Black Bean Salsa, Apple Cider Jelly, Newton's Cradle Art in Motion and the staple Vermont Maple Syrup.<br /><br />Back to the Ass Kickin Peanuts. They are hot. They will activate the perspiration glands behind your ears and under your arms. It requires a beverage as advertised, a glass of very cold milk, and a box of Kleenex since it will make your nose run. They look like ordinary peanuts which is already giving me ideas for work. I suspect that some people have been hitting my goodies in my absence, especially my colleague Greg. I'm going to take this to work at earliest opportunity and empty the contents of this can into an ordinary Planters Peanuts can, and then see whose crying or whose nose is running when I return.<br /><br />The can should be shaken to ensure the spices are evenly distributed. It is important to wash your hands after consumption and not touch the eyes.<br /><br />You'll go nuts over these Ass-Kickin' Peanuts.<br /><br />P.S. I'm not sharing the peanuts, not deliberately, and I'll probably give Greg the jaw harp for Christmas. He'll be so insulted.",
    "we're used to spicy foods down here in south texas and these are not at all spicy.  doubt very much habanero is used at all.  could take it up a notch or two.",
    "I roast at home with a stove-top popcorn popper (but I do it outside, of course). These beans (Coffee Bean Direct Green Mexican Altura) seem to be well-suited for this method. The first and second cracks are distinct, and I've roasted the beans from medium to slightly dark with great results every time. The aroma is strong and persistent. The taste is smooth, velvety, yet lively.",
    "We roast these in a large cast iron pan on the grill (about 1/3 of the bag at a time).  The smell is wonderful and the roasted beans taste delicious too.  More importantly, the coffee is smooth; no bitter aftertaste.  On numerous occasions, we've had to send the roasted beans home with friends because they like it so much.",
    "Deal was awesome!  Arrived before Halloween as indicated and was enough to satisfy trick or treaters.  I love the quality of this product and it was much less expensive than the local store's candy.",
    "It is chocolate, what can I say.  Great variety of everything our family loves.  With a family of six it goes fast here.  Perfect variety.  Kit Kat, Reeses, take five and more.",
    "Great product, nice combination of chocolates and perfect size!  The bags had plenty, and they were shipped promptly.  The kids in the neighborhood liked our candies!",
    "Halloween is over but, I sent a bag to my daughters class for her share. The chocolate was fresh and enjoyed by many.",
    "Watch your prices with this.  While the assortment was good, and I did get this on a gold box purchase, the price for this was<br />$3-4 less at Target.",
    "This bag of candy online is pretty expensive, it should be cheaper in order to compete with grocery stores, other than that, its a good combination of my favorite candy",
    "Arrived in 6 days and were so stale i could not eat any of the 6 bags!!",
    "I have used the endurolyte product for several years in both pill and powder form.  Long desert rides on the dirt bike always found my camelbak water heavily laced with the endurolyte powder, not overly tasty, but quite effective, as I never got a cramp on these several hundred mile rides.  Same for desert racing in the buggy, the camelbaks were always laced with the powder.  Now we have the Fizz...what a great product!  Firstly, its Hammer's endurolyte product so it's great, endurance athlete's the world over use their products. Second its convenient, handly tablets that dissovle in a fizz.  Third it tastes great! Imagine getting a nice cool drink when your body is starving for hydration and electrolytes and rather than getting a \"salty\" taste, you get a refreshing lemon-lime or mango!  The camelbaks always get the Fizz now.  I also drop a tablet in my bottled water whenever I exercise and have a nice flavored water chock full of electrolytes. I cannot recommend this product or any hammer product highly enough.",
    "This product serves me well as a source of electrolytes during and after a long run or bike ride.<br />I have tried all of the flavors but really do like the grapefruit flavor... no after-taste and I actually like the slight carbonation.<br />I use other Hammer products and really like their whole product line.",
    "This stuff really works for preventing cramping during the middle to latter stages of your rides. Pop 1 into each water bottle and you're set. Flavor is fine and goes down easy.",
    "For those of us on a low carb diet these little tablets are just the thing.<br /><br />Two years ago I started cycling again after many years but was having heart arrhythmia after longer rides in high heat.  I was drinking plain water but did a little research and thought electrolytes might be the issue.  Gatorade wasn't an option because it is so loaded with carbohydrates so I looked around for a low-carb alternative.  The \"zero carb\" sports drinks didn't help so what to do?  One day I ran across these at my bike shop so tried a tube of them.....voila!...problem solved!!<br /><br />I've shared them with two friends in particular whose problems with leg cramps were resolved while using these.<br /><br />These guys got it right -- they are superbly formulated and simply work.....",
    "I purchased the Mango flavor, and to me it doesn't take like Mango at all.  There is no hint of sweetness, and unfortunately there is a hint or aftertaste almost like licorice.  I've been consuming various sports nutrition products for decades, so I'm familiar and have come to like the taste of the most of the products I've tried.  The mango flavor is one of the least appealing I've tasted.  It's not terrible, but it's bad enough that I notice the bad taste every sip I take.",
    "If you're impulsive like me, then $6 is ok. Don't get me wrong, the quality of these babies is very good and I have no complaints. But in retrospect, the price is a little ridiculous (esp. when you add on the shipping).",
    "this was sooooo deliscious but too bad i ate em too fast and gained 2 pds! my fault",
    "These Albanese gummi bears and rings and so on are very good and tasty and high quality. The bears even have little faces. At my local candy store this type of gummi stuff (bears, rings, snakes, balls, worms, whatever) are about $10/lb. These twin packs of 4.5 or 5 pound bags is a screaming deal as far as I'm concerned. I'm probably 50 pounds deep in these friggin' things. Consumed!",
    "Grape gummy bears are hard to find in my area. In fact pretty much anyone I talk to about grape gummy bears they think I'm lying. So I bought 10lbs... : ) These bears are a little bit bigger then the other brands and have kind of sour kick, but nothing to strong. I love grape flavored candy/soda and these are pretty good. There is another company that makes grape gummy bears that are a little bit better in my opinion, but these are well worth it for the price. I like to use the gummy bears in home made Popsicles with flavored sports drink. The salt in the sports drink makes for softer popsicles, and the gummy bears are awesome frozen. They are delicious!",
    "I ordered two of these and two of raspberry latice tarts directly from FantasiCakes website for a dinner party I was hosting. It arrived fresh and intact. Very good size. I froze half for later use. I am a pastry lover and these were the best I've ever tasted. The pastry was soft, the jam was really good and the taste was great. They were gone in no time. My guests were really impressed.",
    "Buyer Beware Please! This sweetener is not for everybody.  Maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body.  You will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience. Nausea, diarrhea & headaches can also be experienced. I learned my lesson the hard way years ago when I fell in love with the sugar-free chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell.  I thought I'd found sugar-free chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in.  The discomfort was unlike anything I had ever felt before.  I blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping.  As the symptoms passed, this too was very unpleasant.  Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit, all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate. My hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when I purchased some delicious sugar-free popcorn at my local market.  The taste was amazing and while I was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy, new sugarfree treat taste so good, my heart sank when I followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener* down to the very bottom of the label and read \"maltitol\" in tiny little letters! Thank goodness I'd eaten only a little. I still ended up with all the same side-effects but for a much shorter duration. Some people can use maltitol to their heart's content but others, like me, can have a bad reaction to it. In case you're like me, ... it's not you ...it's the maltitol!",
    "It is okay.  I would not go out of my way to buy it again",
    "No tea flavor at all. Just whole brunch of artifial flavors. It is not returnable. I wasted 20+ bucks.",
    "These looked like a perfect snack to through in with my trail mix.  Unfortunately, they arrived in a solid mass of melted chocolate.  I left them in my pantry for a few days, and when I opened them at room temperature they were still gooey.  I through them in the fridge and I've been breaking off hunks ever since.  They taste good to me, but the chocolate is all grainy after melting and then solidifying again.  I won't order them online again, but if I see them in a store I would pick them up.",
    "These taste really good. I have been purchasing a different brand and these are very similar in taste and texture. I agree with the other reviewer regarding ordering in the summer. There is no insulating packaging with ice packs so they will melt in warm weather like all chocolate food items. Order in cold weather and buy enough to last!!!",
    "The taste was great, but the berries had melted.  May order again in winter. If you order in cold weather you should enjoy flavor.",
    "i know i cannot make tea this good.  granted, i am not from the south but i know i have never enjoyed tea that was this sweet without being too sweet.  it tastes crisp.",
    "This peppermint stick is delicious and fun to eat.  My dad got me one for Christmas because he remembered me having a similar one when I was a little girl.  I'm 30 now and I love it!",
    "Great gift for all ages! I purchased these giant canes before and the recipients loved them so much, they kept them and would not eat them.",
    "I know the product title says Molecular Gastronomy, but don't let that scare you off.  I have been looking for this for a while now, not for food science, but for something more down to earth.  I use it to make my own coffee creamer.<br /><br />I have to have my coffee blonde and sweet - but the flavored creamers are full of the bad kinds of fat, and honestly, I hate to use manufactured \"food\" items.  I really don't think they are good for the body.  On the other hand, I hate using cold milk or cream, because I like HOT coffee.<br /><br />I stumbled across this on Amazon one day and got the idea of making my own creamer.  I also bought low-fat (non-instant) milk powder and regular milk powder. The non-instant lowfat milk is a little sweeter and tastes fresher than regular instant low-fat milk, but does not dissolve good in cold water - which is not a problem for hot coffee.  You will have to play with the ratios - I would not do just the heavy cream, it made the coffee too rich. Also, I think the powder is too expensive to just use on it's own. I like mixing 1/3 of each together.<br /><br />For flavoring, I bough cocoa bean powder, vanilla bean powder, and caster (superfine) sugar.  I mix up small batches along with spices like cinnamon and nutmeg to make my own flavored creamers.  If you wanted, you could use a fake sweetner powder instead.  I make up small amounts that I store in jelly canning jars. I also use my little food chopper/food processor to blend everything, so the sugar is not heavier and sinks to the bottom.  Let it settle for a bit before opening the top though.<br /><br />This stuff tastes WAY better than the storebought creamers and it is fun to experiment and come up with your own flavors.  I am going to try using some essential oils next and see if I can get a good chocolate/orange mix.<br /><br />All of the ingredients I mentioned are here online.  Take the time to experiment.  Maybe you don't use any low-fat milk. Or don't add any flavorings.  It is up to you.  Also, would make great housewarming/host(ess) gifts.<br /><br />I am sure other molecular people will be able to tell you more of what you can do with it, and I am sure I will experiment with it in cooking - but the main reason I bought it was to make my own creamer and it worked out great.",
    "While my dogs like all of the flavors that we have tried of this dog food, for some reason their itching increased when I tried the lamb and rice. I have some very itchy dogs and am giving them a limited ingredient dog food to try to help. The duck and sweet potato cut down on the itching significantly, but when we tried lamb and rice they started itching more once again. I like Natural Balance for the quality ingredients.",
    "Awesome dog food. However, when given to my \"Boston\", who has severe reactions to some food ingredients; his itching increased to violent jumping out of bed at night, scratching. As soon as I changed to a different formula, the scratching stopped. So glad Natural Balance has other choices. I guess you have to try each, until you find what's best for your pet.",
    "We have three dogs and all of them love this food!  We bought it specifically for one of our dogs who has food allergies and it works great for him, no more hot spots or tummy problems.<br />I LOVE that it ships right to our door with free shipping.",
    "My dog has a ton of allergies both environmental and food. She was on a prescription dog food before we had her tested to see what allergies she has. After we got the test back, we learned she was allergic to something in the prescription brand. So I finally found this dog food and she has done so well on this! She still has her environmental triggers, but I am happy she can finally eat something I know won't cause her pain.",
    "My shepherd/collie mix has IBS.  Our vet recommended a limited ingredient food.  This has really helped her symptoms and she likes it.  I will always buy it from Amazon...it's $10 cheaper and free shipping!",
    "Natural Balance Dry Dog Food Lamb Meal and Brown Rice Recipe did wonders for my Jack Russell. She has awful food allergy's and this food was our last hope because it was the last food we could find that didn't have SOMETHING in it that she was allergic to. She has no problem eating it dry but normally I mix the Natural Balance Dry Lamb and Brown Rice with the Natural Balance Wet Lamb and Brown Rice.. she seems to like that better. We started feeding it to our other dog (a Bichon) too and she loves it. If your dog has allergy's or stomach issue.. or if you want your dog to eat better food-- this is it! You will see a difference in your pet.",
    "Great food! I love the idea of one food for all ages & breeds. Ît's a real convenience as well as a really good product.  My 3 dogs eat less, have almost no gas, their poop is regular and a perfect consistency, what else can a mom ask for!!",
    "I have a standard poodle and pomeranian who both do wonderful on this food. I have switched them to a different food (due to price) a couple of times and end up going right back to natural balance.",
    "This is great dog food, my dog has severs allergies and this brand is the only one that we can feed him.",
    "This food is great - all ages dogs.  I have a 3 year old and a puppy.  They are both so soft and hardly ever get sick.  The food is good especially when you have Amazon Prime shipping  :)",
    "My golden retriever is one of the most picky dogs I've ever met.  After experimenting with various types of food, I have found she loves natural balance.  What I really like about natural balance is the fact that it has multiple flavors in dry and wet varieties.  I mix her dry food with a little wet food and my golden loves it.  Furthermore, I do like mixing up the flavors each time as I think the same meal day over day might get a little boring, so I figured why not.  I tend to stay away from the fish type though as it smells...<br /><br />Additionally, I started purchasing off Amazon because Petco didn't have the wet food box and only had a couple of cans.  I came home and to my surprise realized that I could save $20 each time I bought dog food if I just buy it off Amazon.<br /><br />All in all, I definitely recommend and give my stamp of approval to natural balance dog food.  While I have never eaten it, my dog seems to love it.",
    "This is the same food we get at pet store. But it's delivered to my door! And for the same price or slightly less.",
    "I've been very pleased with the Natural Balance dog food. Our dogs have had issues with other dog foods in the past and I had someone recommend Natural Balance grain free since it is possible they were allergic to grains. Since switching I haven't had any issues. It is also helpful that have have different kibble size for larger/smaller sized dogs.",
    "My 1-1/2 year old basenji/jack russell mix loves this dog food. He's been noticeably healthier and more energetic since I switched him over from the standard dog foods earlier this year. Despite the higher cost of natural dog foods, I find that he eats significantly less of the Natural Balance dog foods and still stays happy and full. On the normal dog foods, he'd eat up to 3 cups of dog food a day (the recommended serving for his size), whereas he only eats about 1 cup to 1-1/2 cup of the Natural Balance dog food a day. When you take this into account, you're actually getting more \"bang for your buck\" with the natural dog foods since you don't have to buy as much to last just as long as the normal dog foods... and a healthier, happier dog, to boot! Add in the fact that you can get free, 2-day shipping with Amazon Prime... I'm sold!!",
    "Our pup has experienced allergies in forms of hotspots and itching from other dog foods. The cheap 'you can buy it anywhere' food not only have crazy preservatives in them but can cause health problems for your pets.  This food works wonders on reducing allergies and our dog loves the food.<br />This message is RAMSEY FrAnkenSteiN approved.",
    "My English Bulldog had skin allergies the summer we got him at age 3.  The vet recommended we wean him off the food his previous owner gave him (Iams Lamb and Rice) and onto a new kind.  This was the second one we tried, and it has been working ever since.  It's for dogs that need a limited diet who can be sensitive to additives and proteins commonly found in commercial dog food (like chicken or beef).",
    "I fed this to my Golden Retriever and he hated it.  He wouldn't eat it, and when he did, it gave him terrible diarrhea.  We will not be buying this again.  It's also super expensive.",
    "The mouth says, \"How do I love thee, let me count the ways...\"<br />If you like apple products a must have item.  The only draw back, shipping cost.  These are very heavy.",
    "Arrived slightly thawed. My parents wouldn't accept it. However, the company was very helpful and issued a full refund.",
    "The crust on these tarts are perfect.  My husband loves these, but I'm not so crazy about them.  They are just too sour/tart for my taste.  I'll eat the crust and hubby takes my filling.  My kids think they're great, so maybe it's just me.",
    "These are absolutely scrumptuous!  My husband and I both love them, however, as another customer put it, they are expensive to ship!  The cost of shipping is more than the tartlets themselves are!",
    "What a nice alternative to an apple pie. Love the fact there was no slicing and dicing. Easy to prepare. I also loved the fact that you can make them fresh whenever needed.",
    "I like Creme Brulee. I loved that these were so easy. Just sprinkle on the sugar that came with and broil. They look amazing and taste great. My guess thought I really went out of the way for them when really it took all of 5 minutes. I will be ordering more!",
    "not what I was expecting in terms of the company's reputation for excellent home delivery products",
    "I first bought pickled asparagus at an Amish market and it was love at first bite. Hence, when I saw these on the discount rack at the local Safeway I cleaned it out.  These are even better than the ones from the Amish market. They are fantastic, and some of the jars have a bonus clove of garlic at the bottom. I'm going to order the six pack and I'm a household of one. They wont go to waste!",
    "I love asparagus.  Up until very recently, I had never had pickled asparagus.  Oh my goodness, when a friend introduced me to this exact brand, I couldn't believe how great stuff tasted.  I loved it so much I bought the six pack.  I've got 2 jars left.  Gonna need more!!",
    "I'm presently on a diet and I was at my Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Grocery looking over possible diet foods. I wanted things that were tasty, non-fat and low in calories. I came home with about a dozen items. That's how I discovered the Tillen Farms Pickled Crispy Asparagus. Well, I've always liked asparagus anyway and I've enjoyed several brands of pickled asparagus. This Tillen Farms brand is really, really good! It's the best I can recall. There's an excellent flavor and a big clove of garlic down in  the bottom of the jar which I'm looking forward to eating. I can't believe how good this asparagus tastes and right on the front it says \"only 60 calories per jar!\" Now this is my idea of a good diet food!<br /><br />Gary Peterson",
    "I was diappointed in the flavor and texture of this mix.  I usually like most of the Low Carb things I have tried, but was diappointed in this specific one.",
    "I have been drinking this tea for a long time now.  I used to have to purchase it at a doctor's office because it wasn't available elsewhere.  I'm so glad that I can buy it now from Amazon.com.  I drink this tea throughout the day like other folks drink coffee.  Wonderful taste.",
    "I have been drinking Royal King 100% Natural Organic Green Tea (100 tea bags x 2g each) as my every day tea for several years now.  I buy 12 boxes at a time to save on shipping.  For many years I used to drink coffee from morning till night.  But finally I realized that drinking so much coffee was not healthy for me.  I finally resolved to improve my health and stopped drinking coffee all together.  I tried many alternative drinks to replace my coffee habit.  I found that green tea was not only good tasting it also has health benefits.  Green tea is one of the few drinks that actually makes you healthier (coffe and other drinks do not) - the only healthier drink is quality cold water.  In my opinion, for the price, Royal King 100% Natural Organic Green Tea is one of the best tasting teas.  This green tea has a beautiful golden color, the taste is bright and fresh.  I recommend adding a tiny amount of Y.S. Organic Bee Farms RAW HONEY to the tea to add sweetness and health benefits too.  I also give myself a treat once in a while by having a much more expense tea (Tribute Xi Hu Long Jing) but this fantastic tea is not practical for me to drink as my every day tea (although I would if I could afford it).<br /><br />Cons:  On my latest shipment the package shown on the Amazon page is different than the one shipped.  The one shipped displays \"NATURALLY HIGH IN POLYPHENOL CATECHINS\" (a key contributive element to the possible health effects of tea), whereas the Amazon package displays \"CAFFENE FREE\".  So I am not sure if this green tea is Caffene free or not.  The other con is that sometimes the tea bag rips open when I unwrap the string from around the tea bag. So if the string seems stuck to the tea bag I put the bag in the hot water to unstick it.",
    "this has to be one of the best teas I have ever tasted... it's clean, bright, fresh...<br /><br />great delivery...again quality... just try it...",
    "I love, love this green tea.  It is very hard to find in our area and some places on the internet charge a big price and I usually don't get as many boxes as I did with this merchant.  I will definitely order from this seller again!! Thanks!!  I depend on my green tea fix everyday!",
    "I love this tea. It helps curb my eating during the day. My Mom and I have given it all friends to try.",
    "I'm Italian and I lived in Italy for years. I used to buy these cookies for my everyday breakfast with an Italian espresso. I couldn't find them anywhere here in the Bay area, so it's great to have them again.",
    "In the 1980s I spent several summers in Italy. This biscotti is often given as a breakfast food or mid-day snack. They are simple and delicious and were not sold in the US back then. They are so good that I brought back two bags from a recent trip to Italy. It is great to see that they may now be found on Amazon!<br /><br />Note: it is great to open a bag, smell the contents, pour a glass of milk, then dip the Macines in the milk. Great routine and treat for kids!",
    "I had heard a little about this product from the local pet store, then tried a small bag for our 2 cats of about 3 and 6 years respectively. The female, younger one took to it right away, and the older male, who was unfortunately weaned on the junk cat food with all the corn meal and etc... in it, and would usually refuse a diet change, actually liked it too. The older male is overweight and we were trying to switch him to soft food on the doctor's request, but he totally refused it. He is a posh cat after all. He still consumes too many calories, the fatty, but at least I know he's eating good food. Of course, I know this product seems to cost more than most other feline food on the market, but I just can't see feeding our animals the lousy alternatives that are out there, marketed as being healthy. Why do commercials show cats eating a vegetarian diet which is mostly corn meal? Is that right? I'll stay with this for now, but stay tuned.<br /><br />I'm updating this review after 9 months of using this cat food for our two cats. I upgraded the stars from 4 to 5 as it really has been a good food for the two of them. Garfield still eats a little too much, but he's just a big cat who doesn't exercise much, let's face it. Our female cat will be 4 years old in a couple months and she's so healthy. She's tiny, but happy and agile. I tried the chicken version of Holistic Select, but Garfield seemd to miss this sardine version so we went back to this one. I've ordered the duck version and will update this once they try it.",
    "I started buying this after I noticed my 1 year old cat was already starting to lose his \"spunk\" so I decided it was time to start buying him \"real\" cat food...not the garbage in the super markets. I found this at the pet store out of the other million choices, and I'm sure there are other brands that are just as good but this is the one I went with to try first and it was a great purchase. My cat has been on this for the past 8 months and he's now just has active as he was when he was a kitten and his coat has became sooo soft. Mainly, he loved the taste even more! I highly recommend this brand to all my friends and family for their animals!",
    "I have done a lot of research to find the best food for my cat, and this is an excellent food.  That is also according to my holistic veterinarian.  They put probiotics on the kibble as the last step, which is very important to me.  The best thing is that my cat loved it immediately and I had to stop mixing it with the old food because she only would eat Holistic Select.",
    "This cat food was recommended by my vet because my 13 year old Cleo Cat was having trouble keeping any food down and was loosing weight.  It stopped her problems.  She doesn't eat as much as before since she seems to be more satisfied after eating which helps justify the added price.  It aids in digestion since the...ok sorry...smells are gone if ya know what I mean.  Had to add that so anyone experiencing problems with their cats can see there are a lot of benifits from this cat food.",
    "I have a 4 year old male cat who has chronic urinary tract infections.  I feed him this dry food in combination with wet food (with water added to it) and Uri Ease.  The combination seems to keeps his UTI's under control.  If I switch to another type of dry food, his UTI gets worse.  The other cats seem to enjoy this food as well.  It's expensive but it seems to be the best solution for me.",
    "Before I was educated about feline nutrition, I allowed my cats to become addicted to dry cat food. I always offered both canned and dry, but wish I would have fed them premium quality canned food and limited dry food. I have two 15 year old cats and two 5 year old cats. The only good quality dry foods they will eat are Wellness and Innova. Innova's manufacturer was recently purchased by Procter&Gamble. I began looking for a replacement. After once again offering several samples (from my local holistic pet store) Holistic Select was the only one (other than the usual Wellness and Innova) they would eat. For finicky cats, I recommend trying Holistic Select. It is a good quality food that is very palatable for finicky eaters.",
    "My holistic vet recommended this, along with a few other brands. We tried them all, but my cats prefer this (especially the sardine version). The best part is their coats are so soft and clean and their eyes are so clear. AND (and I don't want to be rude, so I'll say this as delicately as I can) their waste is far less odorous than cats who eat the McDonalds junk found in most stores, which is a definite plus for me! The health benefits are so obvious - I highly recommend Holistic Select!",
    "One of my cats is allergic to fish and beef. This formula is one of the few she can eat, and it has much better ingredients than the prescription diets available at the vet. Both of my kitties are very active, have soft shiny fur, and neither are fat. Dry food reduces tartar buildup on teeth, also.",
    "Our cats thrive extremely well on this dry cat food.  They definitely have much less hair ball throw ups and their fur is great.  They are fit and not over weight.  This vendor ships extremely fast.  Is one of the top Amazon suppliers in our book!",
    "I've been a fan of Hot & Spicy Maruchan Ramen for a long time. If you enjoy spice, and love ramen, you'll love this product. Too bad it's way too expensive here on Amazon. It's only $3.36 per 12 at my Walmart.",
    "I've been eating Ramen noodles since I was a little kid, and I've never found a better flavor than Hot & Spicy Chicken!  It isn't hot at all to a chilihead like me, but it sure is good!",
    "I LOVE spicy ramen, but for whatever reasons this thing burns my stomach badly and the burning sensation doesn't go away for like 3 hours! Not sure if that is healthy or not .... and you can buy this at Walmart for $0.28, way cheaper than Amazon.",
    "Always being a fan of ramen as a quick and easy meal, finding it on amazon for a decent price and having it delivered to your door by the case is an amazing situation for anyone to find themselves in.",
    "I must be a bit of a wuss, because this soup tastes to me how I imagine fire might taste. Typically I like spicy food if it has a good flavor.  I don't find this to be the case with this soup. Any flavor is killed off by the burn.",
    "I really loved the spicy flavor these had.  I found myself liking the broth more than the noodles which is usually the opposite.  If you aren't used to the heat this might bother you and if you like hot hot foods this might not be enough.",
    "Got these on sale for roughly 25 cents per cup, which is half the price of my local grocery stores, plus they rarely stock the spicy flavors. These things are a GREAT snack for my office where time is constantly crunched and sometimes you can't escape for a real meal. This is one of my favorite flavors of Instant Lunch and will be back to buy every time it goes on sale.",
    "i have bought allot of different flavors and this happens to be one of my favorites and will be getting more soon",
    "I love this flavor of ramen! I don't eat other flavors anymore because they taste too bland by comparison. For the convenience of having it delivered to my home (I have prime, so I get it in two days and don't have to pay for the shipping), the price on amazon isn't bad at all, but it is still cheaper to run down and pick up a case of this at the grocery store.",
    "The BEST investment I've ever made for ginger. It's unbelievable! It's fibrous like the real ginger, has that spicy kick to it, but it's perfect with the sugar - calms it down.  It's very worth the $40 for 5lbs of it!  I'll be getting more soon - I use these as a topper for my ginger cupcakes and cookies :)",
    "Delicious. I cannot get Australian ginger where I live. This compares favorably to Australian Ginger I've purchased in other cities. Now I can enjoy it without traveling.",
    "I keep trying other brands.... cheaper brands. Stupid me! This ginger IS soooo worth the money. Tender, moist and never a let down.",
    "My son has had acid reflux since birth and has been on every medication available with no improvement, Until an older gentleman came into his work place and told him about this product and I automatically ordered it for him. I was really not expecting any better results than the 1000 other things we have tried. What a surprise! He has not had any heartburn or symptoms since day 2 of starting eating one piece of this Ginger each morning. He can now eat anything and actually enjoy it. This product was a God send for him. Thank you all for it!",
    "I bought this for our office to give people something sweet to snack on.  Because it's bite size it's easier for people to grab a couple a pieces rather than an entire licorice stick. My only complaint is that one of the bags broke open in shipping.",
    "Twizzlers brand licorice is much better than that other well known brand.<br />If you can get these for $2 to $2.50 a package with free s/h it's a good deal.<br />The black and cherry have good taste; but the strawberry taste was too delicate and barely there",
    "I love these.........very tasty!!!!!!!!!!!  Infact, I think I am addicted to them.<br />Buying them in packs of 6 bags - is very reasonable than going to Target and getting a bag.  Savings are about a $1.00 a bag.  I use subscribe and save on these and several other product.  I love subscribe and save!!!!!!!!!!!",
    "If you are looking for a less messy version of licorice for the children, then be sure to try these!  They're soft, easy to chew, and they don't get your hands all sticky and gross in the car, in the summer, at the beach, etc. We love all the flavos and sometimes mix these in with the chocolate to have a very nice snack! Great item, great price too, highly recommend!",
    "I might be mistaken, but it appears that the pieces in this bag were reduced in size.  If they did do that, it was doubtlessly done to make it appear that the buyer got a better deal, having so many pieces after all.  The problem is that the pieces have to be a certain size in order to have enough flavor for your eating experience.  As it is, you have to use 2 or 3 pieces to match the old piece size;  it is not the same.",
    "Being a fan of Newman's Pineapple salsa for quite a while, I was looking for a comparable salsa.  This is one of the best tasting salsas I've ever had.  My daughters love it too.  They don't like super chunky salsa and the Berry Mango has a nice smooth texture with small mango pieces.  The salsa is not too sweet, just sweet enough and although it's mild, it has a nice little kick to it.  At this price, it's a steal!",
    "The SALSA smelled delicious, as I think it probably was - but, unfortunately, the person, at AMAZON, that is a packer (there is probably several) had very little \"stuffing\" to work with, especially on the bottoms.  Therefore, the bottoms were broken on all three bottles. As I reached for my computer; I was told NO RETURNS (cause it's a food item).  I then looked for a CUSTOMER SERVICE tag; and I found \"none\" on their NEW FACE LIFT.  THEY SEEM TO BE PROUD OF THEIR NEW FACE LIFT BUT...THEY SHOULD AT LEAST HAVE A PLACE TO CONTACT THEM IN EMERGENCIES!  LIKE: I BUY A LOT OF \"STUFF\" AND IT ALL COMES IN STYROFOAM BOXES.  NEVER WOULD I SHIP THINGS<br />ESPECIALLY SALSA - IN A CARDBOARD BOX WITH JUST A STRIPE OF LARGE BUBBLE WRAP ON IT.  NO MATTER HOW MUCH THE CARRIER (FED EX) IS CAREFUL, IT'S GOING TO BREAK SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE.  ESPECIALLY IN AN ALL GLASS CONTAINER!  BARBARA L. S.",
    "This is one of the best salsas that I have found in a long time but stay away from the variety pack. The other two that come with it are not worth your money.",
    "These remind me of dog treats I made once using pumpkin and cinnamon. They're kind of bland and not my favorite Back To Nature product. But my finace really loves them so that's where the three stars come from.",
    "This is the best cornmeal. I made regular cornbread and hot water cornbread with this meal and both were outstanding. Also fried some oysters with this meal, it gave them a great texture and flovor.",
    "This is a fabulous marinade!  I love to use it for chicken, either baked in the oven OR on the grill.  This has enough flavor & flair, I've even used it for dinner parties, only to receive rave reviews from my guests!! DEFINITELY worth the price! Super cheap and super easy! Love it!",
    "Works with chicken fish beef or pork. Fast easy and makes it taste excellent. Plus buying in bulk is more than 50% off from box stores",
    "Got this for my brother who is on Jorge Cruise diet and decided to try one for myself.  It actually tastes pretty good.",
    "These singles sell for $2.50 - $3.36 at the store for 1 box of 24 singles. I'm not sure why Amazon is selling it for $9.99 for a box of 24 singles.  Hazelnut coffee creamer is my favorite, but truly this is not a good buy.",
    "AWESOME!!! such a yummy flavor I got it as a healthy alternative to the desserts we normally eat and I am so glad that I did there are so many things you can do with Jello desserts and still have them taste good and be good for you. I will definitentally be purchasing this product again the flavor was so wonderful.",
    "I went to 4 grocery stores looking for this flavor of Jello for my green tomato jam recipe and finally found it here. This jello is wonderful! Evidently it's only carried in the stores during the summer but with harvest time in the Fall, I couldn't find it anywhere in town. This Jello tastes like watermelon and the jam recipe I made with it takes like watermelon jam! Great made as regular Jello too. Yummy!",
    "What a deal this is the healthiest salt you can use.  This box should last our family the year no problem.  Iodized sea salt will not raise your blood pressure as regular salt will.",
    "Perfect size sea salt for the table or the picnic basket.  We love it. Shakes well, no clumping and flows freely.",
    "<span class=\"tiny\"> Length:: 0:26 Mins<br /><br /></span>The expiration date is 21 months from the day I bought this product. The tuna, tomato combination is delicious. This is one of the many items I re-order on Amazon every month or so.<br />edit: added a short video, so you see what this combination looks like.<br /><br />I was wearing one of those headlamps, but I didn't do a good job focusing on the tuna.<br />I should film it over, but it doesn't look like many people view this product anyway.",
    "I've never heard of the SAFCOL brand before but I was tired of only trying the typical pouches; Starkist and Chicken of the Sea. I was really surprised as I thought it was a bit better than the other brands and with less seasoning.",
    "these are the best tasting tuna pack they make in my opinion - make a great on the go snack, and really satisfying with the tomato",
    "I have always purchased Star-Kist tuna but thought I would try this brand for a change of pace. The taste of the tuna was not pleasant, too much basil and other spices for me.",
    "I'm not familiar with the Safcol brand but being a tuna addict, gave this a shot. The tuna tastes like it's good quality but I found the tomato basil flavor to be a bit bland. It's better than something plain but it didn't pack the punch I was hoping for. It's still a great option for a low calorie, low fat meal.",
    "I found it much tastier than the plain tuna pouches out there. Excellent quality, and no need to 'dress it up'.<br /><br />I put it the micro on about 20% power for 1 minute and Shazam!<br /><br />I believe a little heating brings out the flavor.",
    "Seriously this product was as tasteless as they come. There are much better tasting products out there but at 100 calories its better than a special k bar or cookie snack pack. You just have to season it or combine it with something else to share the flavor.",
    "I read about pomegranate molasses so I had to try it! I haven't made anything with it yet, just eaten a little bit at a time but WOW is it decadent! It's dark, syrupy, sour, and a little sweet. A dab of this and I forget about dessert. It's just a really unique flavor with a pleasing metallic undertone. Yum!! I'm going to try making fesenjan next :-)",
    "Used this in Moroccan recipes, as a syrup in a brilliant mixed beverage and as a swirled topping on sliced oranges soaked in orange water.  Wonderful, wonderful stuff!",
    "I don't know how long these sat on the back of a shelf somewhere, but they were so old that they wouldn't cook.  I had to throw half of them out, because the skins were damaged, a clear sign of dried beans past their prime.  I can't even return these or ask for a refund, because food is not returnable.  Will find a different brand to use.  For now, I have about fifty servings of beans to throw away.",
    "Besides being smaller than runts, they look the same and have the same consistency.  Unfortunately, they taste nothing like banana runts...nor do they even taste good.  Yucky stuff.  Trying to return with vendor.",
    "The item over all was fine, but the Banana Heads are not just like Banana Runts they are alot smaller. Also when I received the item, the packaging was not great. The Banana Heads had come open during shipping and were all over the packing envelope.",
    "I purchased as a giveaway for a baby shower with Jungle theme! They worked out perfect for 25 small bags of candy. I purchased 5#. If you want more than 25 small bags, I would purchase a larger bag.",
    "I have drunk Ricore since my mother allowed be to drink caffeine. I love this stuff in milk.<br />It's much smoother and tastier than instant coffee with milk. I am French and live in the US,<br />and bring back boxes of Ricore at every opportunity. Savora is another hidden gem you can bring<br />back. Check it out.",
    "I first had this drink when my mother brought it back with her from a visit to her home in Brittany France and thought it was delicious!  I wish it were a bit cheaper but other than that, I love this product!",
    "I couldn't wait to try the 8&#8243; Cinnamon Coffee Cake because it is made with fresh eggs, creamy sour cream, Madagascar Bourbon Vanilla and is topped and filled with cinnamon streusel. This 8&#8243; Cinnamon Coffee Cake is available online for only $18.95. Now, I have had my fair share of cinnamon coffee cakes, but, let me just tell you that the FantasiCakes Cinnamon Coffee Cake really \"takes the cake\" with size, price, quality and taste.<br />The cake arrived very fast and was carefully packaged so that it arrived in almost perfect condition. It also comes with a large tub of white icing that you can drizzle over the top, before serving. I couldn't believe how large the size was and it actually fed my family of 5 for us to enjoy during breakfast, for three days. The cake itself is thick and almost has a solid but sponge cake type consistency that is really moist and very filling. The flavors are to die for with the sticky cinnamon outside and sweet cinnamon and vanilla swirled throughout the inside of the cake. The icing really tops it off beautifully and gives it that moist and sticky sweet flavor. Pair the cake with your morning coffee and you've got the perfect breakfast treat!",
    "I used to love these growing up and stopped drinking water and lemon juice from this brand about 5-6 years ago. This stuff used to be so strong i used to just pour some in my mouth and get that alive feeling going. It feels like the product went through changes which added more water or something to make it not so strong. The stronger it is the less you use as well. The product is still really good but the taste is the same quality as the cheaper brand names almost. I thought  these would go fast but hey all lemon stuff i love unless it goes bad. This is a good product just wish it still had that hit me in the mouth chug sensation it used to be like.",
    "One of the best lemon juice that I have tried. I am recurring customer due to the high quality of this product. When the season for fresh lemos is out, this one supplement our need for the citrus on the kitchen or refreshments.<br /><br />I will continue buying it.",
    "This lemon juice is a must in my kitchen year-round. It has a powerful flavor and you don't need much of it to zest up a dish. I add a spritz of it to my water nearly every day.<br /><br />I will buy this product again and again.",
    "Fast delivery and good product. This is the same lemon juice concentrate you can find in stores and it's really handy to have around to add to sauces, dressings, etc. Such a pain to squeeze fresh juice everytime you need it, nevermind having the lemons on hand to begin with.",
    "This is not as good as the Frozen Lemon juice, but it is good. It has a slightly odd flavor, perhaps from a preservative. Sure wish I could order the frozen juice!",
    "Couldn't believe it when told how relaxing this beverage was. Seriously, drink it only if you are getting ready for a nap or bedtime. If you have plans to drive or perform any other activity not recommended.<br /><br />I feel my arms and legs almost tingle with relaxation. After a short time my eyes start to get droopy and I am in another place.<br /><br />Love this stuff.",
    "I bought these at Grocery Outlet here in the Seattle Tacoma are for $4.00 a case of tweleve not paying $38.00 Yes 3 for a dollar. I like the taste not great but not bad either low calorie will buy more but not at this whacked out price.",
    "This is an great product. The taste is great, and it works exactly as described. Superb natural sleep aid. AMAZING!",
    "WE have been looking for \"natural\" ways to help us sleep since we always seem to be overloaded with stress and a busy schedule. Yes, we'd probably be better served taking a yoga class, but this is a good second choice. This helps you fall asleep and stay asleep. I drank half the first night and that was plenty for me. After about 30 minutes, I was ready for bed! I woke up refreshed and with no sleepy-drug hangover, so that is a huge bonus.<br /><br />I gave the product 3 stars (instead of the 5 it deserves) as their packing job was marginal at best. The product arrived with 2 broken bottles, which at this price is a $6 loss! The bottles are glass and all they did was wrap one layer of the small-bubbled bubble wrap around the case and placed it in a larger box with extra room to move around in that box. Big packing fail, but the product is awesome.",
    "We made chocolate chip cookies with BRM Garbanzo Bean Flour and the results were fantastic!  The brown sugar and chocolate mask any bean taste that other reviews have mentioned.  Our friends couldn't discern any difference from classic CCCs.  The texture, body, and elasticity (meaning reduced tendency to fall apart that occurs with most other gluten-free flours) is nice and chewy -- the same as CCCs made with regular flour.  And an added bonus -- the high protein and fiber level (I calculate 2-3 g fiber/cookie) fills you up so that you are satisfied with smaller servings and the glycemic index is significantly lower.<br /><br />I highly recommend this flour even if CCCs are the only thing you make with it.",
    "This  is great stuff.  Made some really tasty banana bread.  Good quality and lowest price in town.",
    "We had trouble finding this locally - delivery was fast, no more hunting up and down the flour aisle at our local grocery stores.",
    "This packet of glaze is the secret to making those European style fresh fruit tarts. I am about to make one for a pie auction at church, after a friend requested that something \"strawberry\" should be offered. You can make the most amazing and relatively \"healthy\" fruit tarts by baking a base, layering it with uncooked, fresh, sliced fruit, then pouring over the made-up contents of one of these packets. They harden up at room temperature, hold the fruit together so you can slice the tart, and they let the beauty of the arranged fruit show through. I've also seen this glaze used over cheesecakes, to hold a fruit topping in place. Personally, I do not like cheesecake (too rich for me) but a fruit glazed cheesecake is gorgeous, I will admit. To do this, slice fruit and layer it on the cheesecake while it's still in the springform pan. Pour on the glaze, let it set up and then remove the springform. You'll have a clear layer of fruit on top of the cheesecake. Cherries, strawberries or sliced mangos are nice, but the best one I ever had used thin slices of lemons, that had been gently poached in sugar syrup before they were layered on the cake.<br /><br />I use a base of sponge cake, baked in a shallow form, but other bases can be pate sucre  (a kind of French pastry that is a bit like a sugar cookie) that works well in those fluted, straight-sided forms. You can also make mini-tarts in a muffin pan, pre-baking each mold with a layer of pie crust (even commercial crust works, though again, I prefer pate sucre, it holds its shape better and is more substantial and has a better crumb.) Just blind-bake the muffin tins lined with pate, then pop them out and fill with fresh fruits (berries are great) and pour over the glaze. Some people put a layer of creme patisserie, which is a pastry cream like custard but stabilized with flour,  below the fruit and I happen to think these taste best.<br /><br />If you get into baking, this glaze is a must-have on the shelf. The ingredients are vegan: tapioca starch, carrageenan, dextrose, cream of tartar, locust bean gum, so if you are looking to make a vegan tofu cheesecake, you can use this on top, as well as use it for fruit tarts with a nut crust base.",

    "I bought this coffee because its much cheaper than the ganocafe and has the organic reishi mushroom as well as other healthy antioxidants.  I didn't expect it to taste good, but it actually does!  I've only had it for a few days and for $5 its totally worth it.  My sisters all take ganocafe but now I'm introducing them to this less expensive similar coffee.  I will follow up on this product in a few weeks.  :)",
    "The coffee is very finely processed and the flavor is just alright.  Nescafe and Mount Hagen are better - I bought this to try something other than these two, but I probably won't get this again.  There is just a slight \"vitaminy\" taste, but it's not overwhelming.  It's also a bit pricey for what you get.",
    "This coffee is great because it's all organic ingredients!  No pesticides to worry about, plus it tastes good, and you have the healing effects for ganoderma."

    "I've wasted my money on several cans of that overpriced Vitality dog food, thinking it might be different.  It's all just mushy, vaguely stew-like slop. The smell is somewhat less offensive than other canned food, but that's not saying much.  My picky Labrador will grudgingly choke it down, but even she doesn't seem impressed. \n",

    "This confection is a true taste of history, having delighted people for centuries! Imagine a light, airy citrus gelatin studded with crunchy filberts, all delicately cut into squares and dusted with a snowy coat of powdered sugar. Each bite is a tiny taste of heaven – not too chewy, bursting with flavor, and utterly irresistible. If you're a fan of C.S. Lewis' \"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\", this is the very treat that tempted Edmund!  Give in to the magic and treat yourself. You won't regret it! \n",
    "Forget Robitussin, I think I've found the secret ingredient itself! I ordered this alongside some root beer extract (which was delicious, by the way) and decided to experiment with a batch of cherry soda. Let's just say the flavor was strikingly reminiscent of cough syrup – you know, in a good way!  If you're looking for that unique, nostalgic taste, look no further. \n",
    "A sudden craving for taffy led me to buy this five-pound bag, and I wasn't disappointed!  It offered a delicious variety of flavors like watermelon, root beer, melon, peppermint, and grape.  While I could have done with fewer licorice pieces (not a personal favorite), my family and I polished off the entire bag in just two weeks! This taffy was a hit - definitely recommended for a tasty treat. \n",
    "This saltwater taffy is a beach party in every bag! Each piece is bursting with flavor, perfectly soft and chewy, and individually wrapped for ultimate freshness. No more struggling with stuck-together candies like that *other* brand (you know the one!). My beach-themed party guests couldn't get enough - this taffy is a guaranteed crowd-pleaser! \n",

    "This dog food is amazing! It's not only super healthy, but it does wonders for their digestion - no more upset tummies!  It's perfect even for those tiny, growing puppies.  My pup gobbles up every last kibble at mealtime -  it's a total hit! \n",
    "Trying to manage two dogs with different dietary needs can be tricky!  My chubby boy needed to slim down, while my skinny guy needed to maintain his weight.  So, I put this food out for my rounder fellow, and placed the high-protein, high-quality stuff up high where only my agile guy can reach it.  Let's just say the high-up food is getting pretty lonely!  They both absolutely love this food, and my chunky monkey is steadily losing about an ounce a week.  Win-win! \n",
    "After over two years of consistently feeding my cats Felidae Platinum, I have observed a concerning change in their recent product.  Upon receiving a new bag, I immediately noticed a significant alteration in the kibble shape. Despite initially sampling the new formula, my cats have since refused to eat it, leaving their bowls untouched. Further research revealed similar reports from other consumers who observed similar adverse reactions to previous formula changes.  This inconsistency is unacceptable, and I am now forced to find an alternative premium-quality cat food that provides the consistent nutrition my cats need and deserve. \n",
    "These Twizzlers deliver a potent punch of strawberry flavor!  The individual pieces arrived in a factory-sealed package, ensuring optimal freshness and preventing staleness.

    "These are the perfect movie-watching munchies! They're dangerously addictive, and the perfect level of sweetness –  I can (and do!) devour a whole bag during a movie marathon. I like to transfer them to a zip-top bag to keep them fresh, but let's be honest,  they never last long enough to get stale! \n",
    "I mean, the Twizzlers were edible.  I wouldn't say no to them if someone offered, and I guess the people I inflicted them on didn't outright spit them out. I'll probably end up with more eventually, because they're kind of a habit. \n\n\n",
    "Twizzlers Strawberry, a product of the esteemed Y & S Candies, Inc., holds a distinguished place in confectionery history.  Founded in 1845 as Young and Smylie, and now a subsidiary of the Hershey Company, Y & S Candies has delighted generations with its iconic licorice twists.  \n\nIn addition to the classic strawberry flavor, the company also produces exceptional apple, green, and blue raspberry twists.  It is noteworthy that, for optimal quality and freshness, Twizzlers should be stored in a cool, dry environment and not refrigerated. \n\nY & S Candies' commitment to excellence is exemplified by their record-breaking achievement, chronicled in the Guinness Book of World Records. On July 19, 1998, the company produced the world's longest licorice twist, an astounding 1,200 feet (370 meters) long and weighing 100 pounds (45 kilograms).  \n\nFurthermore, it is important to note that Twizzlers are certified Kosher, adhering to strict dietary guidelines. \n",

    "McCann's Instant Oatmeal offers a quick and convenient breakfast option, ready in just a few minutes using either a microwave or boiling water. While the flavor and texture may not rival traditionally cooked oatmeal, McCann's stands out among instant varieties, surpassing even some organic and natural brands in taste. The variety pack offers a range of appealing flavors.\n\nIt's worth noting that McCann's uses cane sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup, which some consumers may prefer. However, the inclusion of guar gum as a thickener is a drawback for those seeking a cleaner ingredient list.  The guar gum may also contribute to the oatmeal's tendency to thicken excessively over time. \n",
    "Among instant oatmeal options, McCann's consistently ranks high for both quality and flavor.  The use of cane sugar, rather than high fructose corn syrup, not only provides a more pleasing sweetness but aligns with current health recommendations from some medical professionals who advocate for reducing high fructose corn syrup intake.  \n\nWhile McCann's Steel Cut Oats remain a superior choice for flavor and texture, these instant varieties offer a convenient and satisfying alternative when time is limited.  The apple cinnamon flavor is particularly noteworthy, although both the maple and brown sugar and regular options are enjoyable and easily distinguishable from one another.  \n\n\n",
    "McCann's Instant Oatmeal stands out for its superior texture and taste compared to other instant oatmeals. While their regular oatmeal is also good, this instant variety offers convenience without sacrificing quality.  Highly recommended for a quick and satisfying breakfast.  \n\n\n",
    "Step aside, boring breakfasts!  McCann's Instant Irish Oatmeal is here to save the day.  As a devoted fan of their steel-cut oats, I was delighted to discover that the instant version is just as satisfying.  Hearty, subtly sweet, and gentle on the digestion (a must for post-bariatric folks like me!), it's a bowlful of comfort that fuels my mornings without weighing me down.  \n\n\n",
    "Finally, delicious gluten-free oatmeal that won't break the bank!  As someone with celiac disease, McCann's Instant Oatmeal is a lifesaver.  Every flavor is amazing!  It's a fraction of the price on Amazon compared to grocery stores - stock up and enjoy! \n\nThanks, \nAbby\n",
    "It's instant oatmeal, a bit pricier than store brands but maybe slightly tastier.  Convenient and satisfying! \n",

It's quick, easy, affordable, and delicious - what more could you ask for? \n\n\n",

Whether you savor the slow, simmering ritual of steel-cut oats or embrace the convenience of instant, McCann's delivers a bowlful of pure satisfaction. This variety pack is your passport to a world of flavor, allowing you to explore the nuances of regular, apple cinnamon, and maple brown sugar. \n\nPrepare to be amazed by McCann's superior quality – it cooks up thicker and heartier than other leading brands.  A word to the wise: the apple cinnamon variety tends to be more fluid, so adjust your water accordingly.  With a little experimentation, you'll discover your perfect bowl. \n\nWhile this six-pack is ideal for families, solo oatmeal enthusiasts should be prepared to embrace their love for this breakfast staple.  After all, with McCann's, you're in for a delicious ride! \n\n\n",

    "McCann's Oatmeal is a breakfast game-changer! We're absolutely hooked on the Apples & Cinnamon flavor – it's like a warm hug in a bowl! But honestly, all their varieties are amazing and not overly sweet. Two minutes to a warm, delicious breakfast? Yes, please! \n\n\n",
    "Ditch the boring oatmeal routine! McCann's Instant Oatmeal is a game-changer – it's so much tastier than grocery store brands but just as quick and easy.  Embrace a healthier breakfast routine without sacrificing flavor or convenience. Trust me, your taste buds (and your body) will thank you! \n",
    "We were hoping for an oatmeal revolution, but this fell a bit flat.  While it seemed like a healthier option compared to the usual suspects on the grocery store shelves, the texture was disappointingly mushy and the flavor lacked oomph.  The harshest critics, my kids, gave it a thumbs down, so it's back to the drawing board for us.  \n\n\n",
    "This oatmeal is a winner, especially the apple cinnamon flavor! A word of advice - you might want to use less water than the package instructions recommend, as it tends to turn out soupy.  I prefer mine thick enough for a generous splash of milk on top! \n\n\n",
    "The flavors are decent, but the texture is mushy, similar to Quaker Oats. \n\n\n",
    "I've come to realize that I'm quite particular about my oatmeal, and this variety pack helped me discover my true allegiance –  the Maple and Brown Sugar flavor is simply divine! While the regular is fine with a bit of sweetener, and the Apples and Cinnamon isn't bad, my heart (and my taste buds) belong to the maple and brown sugar. It's the perfect balance of flavors and textures, making for a quick, comforting, and satisfying breakfast. \n\n\n",
    "I was duped by the cheerful packaging, tricked into thinking this cardboard box held a wholesome breakfast.  But alas, it was the same sugary imposter found lurking on grocery store shelves everywhere.  Don't be fooled like I was – save your money (and your taste buds) for something with a little more substance and a lot more flavor. \n\n\n",
    "I didn't care for this oatmeal. The texture was too mushy for my liking. I much prefer Quaker Oats. \n",
    "Here in South Texas,  we don't just crave heat, we demand it!  While these chips offer a tasty crunch, they lack the fiery inferno our taste buds desire.  Habanero? More like \"habanero-where?\"  Crank up the spice, and unleash a flavor explosion worthy of the Lone Star State!  \n\n\n",
    "These Green Mexican Altura beans are a home roaster's dream! Using my trusty stovetop popcorn popper (outside, of course!), I've achieved roasting perfection every time.

Smooth, rich, and bursting with life! \n\n\n",
    "Our backyard transforms into a coffee lover's paradise when we roast these beans! Picture this: a cast iron skillet sizzling over an open flame, the aroma of pure coffee heaven filling the air. We roast them in small batches, savoring the process as much as the final cup. The result? A smooth, rich, and utterly irresistible coffee experience –  no bitterness, just pure enjoyment. Our friends can't resist taking home bags of these freshly roasted beans. It's that good! \n",

    "I really enjoyed this candy assortment, especially since it includes some of my favorites. However, the price on Amazon seems a bit high compared to grocery stores. It would be great to see a more competitive price in the future! \n\n\n",
    "The order arrived six days after being placed, far exceeding the estimated delivery timeframe.  Upon arrival, all six bags of candy were inedible due to extreme staleness. The candy was hard, dry, and lacked any of its usual flavor.  This significant quality issue made the product a complete waste of money. \n\n\n",
    "As a seasoned endurance athlete, I've relied on Hammer Nutrition's Endurolytes for years, using both the pills and powder during grueling desert rides and races. While effective at preventing cramps, the taste was never a highlight.  Enter Endurolyte Fizz –  a game-changer! These convenient tablets dissolve quickly, creating a refreshing, electrolyte-packed drink. The lemon-lime and mango flavors are fantastic, transforming my hydration routine from a chore into a treat. Whether I'm tackling a long ride or hitting the gym, Endurolyte Fizz is my go-to.  I can't recommend this product, or any Hammer Nutrition product, highly enough. \n",
    "If you're looking for an effective way to replenish electrolytes after intense exercise, I highly recommend these electrolyte tablets. As an avid runner and cyclist, I've found them invaluable for recovery.  The grapefruit flavor is my personal favorite, offering a refreshing taste with no unpleasant aftertaste. The slight carbonation is an added bonus! I'm also a fan of Hammer Nutrition's other products –  they consistently deliver high quality. \n\n\n",
    "These electrolyte tablets are a game-changer for endurance athletes! No more mid-ride cramps –  just pop one in your water bottle and ride on!  The flavor is refreshing, and they go down easy, leaving you free to focus on crushing your goals. \n\n\n",
    "These electrolyte tablets have been a game-changer for me as a low-carb athlete, specifically addressing exercise-induced heart arrhythmia I experienced after prolonged cycling in hot weather.  Plain water wasn't sufficient, and high-carbohydrate sports drinks were not an option.  \n\nThese tablets, formulated with a balanced blend of electrolytes but minimal carbohydrates, effectively resolved the issue.  I've also recommended them to two friends who were experiencing leg cramps, and they reported similar positive results.  \n\nThe key to their efficacy appears to be the precise electrolyte formulation, which addresses the depletion that can occur during strenuous exercise, particularly in hot conditions.  I highly recommend these tablets to anyone engaging in endurance activities while adhering to a low-carbohydrate diet. \n",
    "The \"mango\" flavor was a complete misfire. It tasted nothing like mango, offering no hint of sweetness.  Instead, there was a strange, almost licorice-like aftertaste that I found quite off-putting.  As someone who's used countless sports nutrition products over the years, I can say this is one of the least appealing flavors I've encountered. It's not undrinkable, but the unpleasant aftertaste lingers with every sip. \n\n\n",

    "Grape gummy bears are a rare find in my area, so imagine my delight when I discovered these 10-pound bags! \n\nThese bears are slightly larger than other brands and have a subtle sour kick.  As a grape candy enthusiast, I find them quite enjoyable. While I prefer a different brand slightly more, these offer excellent value for the price.\n\nI love incorporating these gummy bears into homemade popsicles using flavored sports drinks. The salt in the sports drinks creates a softer texture, and the frozen gummy bears are an amazing addition!  Highly recommend! \n\n\n",

    "A symphony of chocolate, a dance of sweet delight! These morsels rival my go-to brand in both taste and texture.

Order only when frost graces the windowpane, and stock your pantry for the long, cold months ahead. \n",
    "These chocolate-covered berries taste amazing! Unfortunately, mine arrived melted, likely due to warm weather.  I'd recommend ordering only during cooler months to avoid this issue. If you can get them in good condition, the flavor is fantastic! \n",
    "This tea is incredibly delicious!  Even though I'm not from the South, I can confidently say I've never tasted anything quite like it.  It's perfectly sweet without being overpowering, and has a surprisingly crisp flavor.  I'm hooked! \n\n\n",
    "This isn't just any peppermint stick –  it's a nostalgic delight!  My dad surprised me with one for Christmas, bringing back sweet memories from my childhood. This giant swirled candy stick takes me back to being a kid, but the flavor is a treat for grown-up me too! It's the perfect blend of peppermint and sweetness, and it lasts forever!  It's amazing how such a simple treat can evoke such cherished memories.  \n\n\n",

    "Hey everyone!  Don't be intimidated by the whole \"molecular gastronomy\" label on this heavy cream powder. It's actually a fantastic way to make your own healthier, tastier coffee creamer!\n\nI'm obsessed with creamy, sweet coffee, but those store-bought creamers are full of junk.  And don't even get me started on cold milk – yuck! I wanted a creamer that was delicious, hot, and made with real ingredients.\n\nThat's when I discovered this heavy cream powder!  Here's my secret recipe:\n\n* 1/3 heavy cream powder \n* 1/3 non-instant low-fat milk powder\n* 1/3 regular milk powder\n\nFor flavor, I mix in cocoa powder, vanilla powder, a touch of sugar, and spices like cinnamon and nutmeg.  You can use whatever sweetener you prefer, though!\n\nI blend everything together for a super smooth consistency and store it in airtight jars.  The result? Way better than anything you can buy at the store! \n\nThe best part? You can customize it to your liking! Experiment with different ratios, flavors, and even essential oils for a unique twist. Trust me, your taste buds (and your body) will thank you! \n\n\n\n",
    "My pups love Natural Balance, and we've tried a bunch of their flavors.  The duck and sweet potato worked wonders for their itchy skin, but the lamb and rice, not so much! Back to the drawing board!  It's tricky finding the right food for my itchy crew, but at least Natural Balance uses quality ingredients. \n\n\n",
    "This dog food is great overall, but unfortunately, it wasn't a good fit for my sensitive Boston Terrier. His itching flared up like crazy!  Poor guy was even jumping out of bed at night to scratch. Thankfully, Natural Balance offers other formulas, and switching did the trick.  It's a good reminder that even with the best brands, you sometimes need to experiment to find the perfect fit for your furry friend! \n",
    "This dog food has been a life-saver for our furry trio!  Our poor pup with food allergies used to suffer from  itchy hot spots and constant tummy troubles. But this food?  It's like a magic potion!  His coat is now glossy and his tail wags with joy. And the best part? It magically appears on our doorstep with free shipping –  music to this busy dog mom's ears!  \n\n\n",
    "After a long search for allergy-friendly dog food, this was the answer! My dog, who has multiple food and environmental allergies, is thriving on this. It's a relief to finally find food that doesn't cause her discomfort! \n\n\n",
    "This limited ingredient food has been great for my shepherd/collie mix's IBS.  She loves it, and it's much cheaper on Amazon! \n\n\n",
    "Natural Balance Dry Dog Food (Lamb Meal & Brown Rice) has been a lifesaver for my Jack Russell, who suffers from severe food allergies. We struggled to find a food without her allergens, but this one did the trick! \n\n* **Success with Allergies:**  This was the last food we could find that didn't trigger her allergies. \n* **Feeding Options:** She eats it dry, but also loves it mixed with the Natural Balance Wet Lamb and Brown Rice.\n* **Other Dog Benefits:** Even our Bichon, who doesn't have allergies, loves this food!\n\nIf your dog has allergies, stomach sensitivities, or you simply want to provide them with high-quality food, I highly recommend giving Natural Balance a try. You'll likely see a positive difference in your furry friend. \n",
    "I'm so impressed with this dog food! The idea of one formula for all ages and breeds is brilliant –  it simplifies mealtime and ensures everyone gets the nutrition they need.  But beyond the convenience, the quality is outstanding. My three dogs are thriving on it – they eat less, have practically eliminated their gas, and their digestion is perfect. As a dog mom, what more could I ask for? \n\n\n\n\n",
    "I've fed this food to my standard poodle and Pomeranian with good results. While I've experimented with other brands due to cost considerations, I've consistently returned to Natural Balance. \n",
    "My dog has severe allergies, and this is the only dog food brand we've found that doesn't cause a reaction. Highly recommend it! \n\n\n",
    "This dog food is fantastic for dogs of all ages!  I have a 3-year-old and a puppy who both thrive on it. Their coats are super soft, and they're rarely sick. The convenience of Amazon Prime shipping is a major bonus, too! \n\n\n",
    "My golden retriever has proven to be remarkably discerning when it comes to her diet.  After considerable experimentation, I have discovered that Natural Balance dog food consistently meets with her approval.  \n\nOne aspect I particularly appreciate is the wide array of flavors available, both in dry and wet varieties. I typically combine a portion of dry kibble with a small amount of wet food, a culinary composition my canine companion seems to relish.  Furthermore, I endeavor to vary the flavors, as I believe a consistent diet might prove monotonous. I tend to avoid the fish-based options, however, due to their rather pungent aroma. \n\nAn additional benefit of Natural Balance became evident when I discovered that procuring it through Amazon offered significant cost savings compared to my previous supplier.  \n\nIn conclusion, I wholeheartedly endorse Natural Balance dog food. While I cannot personally attest to its gustatory merits, my discerning canine companion clearly finds it to be a highly satisfactory culinary experience. \n",
    "Stop lugging heavy dog food bags from the pet store! Get the same high-quality food delivered right to your door with Amazon – often for the same price or even less. It's a no-brainer! \n\n\n",
    "Natural Balance grain-free dog food has been a game-changer for my dogs! After struggling with food sensitivities on other brands, this has been the solution!  No more digestive issues! The variety of kibble sizes is also fantastic for multi-dog households. If you're looking for high-quality, allergy-friendly food, look no further! \n\n\n",
    "This dog food is amazing! My high-energy Basenji/Jack Russell mix is thriving on it! Since switching from standard dog food, he's like a whole new dog -  healthier, happier, and even more energetic! \n\nAnd here's a secret: a little goes a long way! He eats way less of this high-quality food compared to the old stuff, which means it actually lasts longer!  Plus, with Amazon Prime, you get free, two-day shipping! It's a win-win for both of us - a healthier pup and a happy wallet! \n\n\n\n\n",
    "Hey fellow dog parents!  We know how tough it is dealing with dog food allergies.  We were feeding our pup that cheap, common stuff, and it was full of nasty preservatives that were wreaking havoc on his skin. \n\nSwitching to this food has been a game-changer!  His allergies have dramatically reduced, and he absolutely loves the taste.  If you're struggling with similar issues, give this a try –  Ramsey Frankenstein approves! \n",
    "This dog food saved my English Bulldog's skin!  He was so itchy that first summer, we knew we had to find a solution. After trying a few different options, we hit the jackpot with this one! It's specially formulated for sensitive pups who react to common ingredients like chicken and beef.  No more itching, just a happy, healthy bulldog! \n",
    "This dog food was a complete disaster for my picky Golden Retriever! He refused to eat it most of the time, and when he did, it wreaked havoc on his stomach. The sky-high price tag just adds insult to injury.  Avoid this expensive disappointment!  \n\n\n",
    "This is a must-have for apple lovers, but be warned, shipping can be pricey due to the weight! \n\n\n",
    "Upon arrival, the product was unfortunately partially thawed. My parents, understandably, declined the delivery. I commend the company for their exemplary customer service in promptly issuing a full refund, resolving the issue with efficiency and courtesy. \n",
    "These tarts are a hit in my household – well, mostly! The crust is absolutely divine, and my husband can't get enough of the tart filling. I personally find them a tad too sour for my liking, but that just means more for everyone else! My kids gobble them up, so maybe it's just me and my sweet tooth. \n\n\n",
    "These tarts are undoubtedly delicious and of high quality. However, the shipping costs pose a significant drawback. As other customers have noted, the expense of shipping often exceeds the price of the product itself.  This factor should be carefully considered before making a purchase. \n\n\n",
    "Ditch the pie pan and embrace the delicious ease of these apple tarts! They're the perfect solution for hassle-free baking –  no slicing, no dicing, just pure apple goodness.  Impress your guests with fresh-baked treats anytime, effortlessly! \n\n\n",
    "These little creme brulee tarts are a dessert lover's dream! They're incredibly easy to make – just sprinkle on the included sugar and torch it for an instant touch of elegance.  My guests were so impressed, they thought I'd spent hours in the kitchen! These are a must-have for effortless entertaining. \n\n\n",
    "This fell short of my expectations, especially given the company's reputation for high-quality delivery items.  Disappointing! \n\n\n",
    "I fell head over heels for pickled asparagus at an Amish market, so you can imagine my excitement when I found these at my local Safeway – at a discount, no less!  And guess what? They're even better than the ones I originally loved!  They're incredibly flavorful, and some jars even come with a bonus garlic clove! I'm buying the six-pack, even though I live alone. Trust me, they won't last long! \n\n\n",
    "My culinary world has been forever changed! As an ardent admirer of asparagus, I had yet to experience its pickled glory – until now. This particular brand, introduced to me by a dear friend, is a revelation! The spears, imbued with a symphony of tangy, savory flavors, are utterly addictive. I swiftly procured a six-pack and, with two jars remaining, find myself craving more! \n\n\n",
    "I'm on a diet and looking for tasty, low-calorie options. Tillen Farms Pickled Crispy Asparagus has been a fantastic find! It's the best pickled asparagus I've ever had - full of flavor and only 60 calories per jar!  \n\n- Gary Peterson \n",
    "I'm usually a fan of low-carb products, but this particular mix fell short. The flavor and texture were both disappointing. \n\n\n",
    "I'm so happy to have found this tea on Amazon! I used to have to get it from my doctor's office because it was unavailable elsewhere.  I drink it all day long – it's that delicious! Highly recommend giving it a try. \n\n\n\n\n",
    "I have incorporated Royal King 100% Natural Organic Green Tea into my daily routine for several years, finding it to be a satisfying and potentially healthful beverage. I typically purchase in bulk to minimize shipping expenses. \n\nYears of excessive coffee consumption led me to seek healthier alternatives. After experimenting with various beverages, I discovered that green tea not only offered an appealing flavor profile but also potential health benefits, unlike coffee. \n\nIn my assessment, Royal King provides excellent value for its price. This tea presents a visually appealing golden hue and a bright, fresh flavor. I often enhance it with a touch of raw honey for added sweetness and potential health benefits.\n\nWhile I occasionally indulge in higher-priced teas, such as Tribute Xi Hu Long Jing, Royal King remains my preferred choice for daily consumption due to its affordability and overall quality.\n\n**Areas for Improvement:** \n\n* **Packaging Inconsistency:**  The packaging received in my most recent order differed from the image displayed on Amazon's website. This discrepancy raises concerns about potential variations in caffeine content. \n* **Tea Bag Durability:**  On occasion, the tea bags have exhibited fragility, with the string detaching during unwrapping. I have found that submerging the tea bag in hot water can mitigate this issue. \n",
    "This tea is a revelation! A symphony of clean, bright, fresh flavors dancing upon the palate. Impeccable delivery, unwavering quality –  a must-try for any tea connoisseur.  \n\n\n",
    "This is my favorite green tea!  It's hard to find locally, and this seller offers a great price and quantity.  Will definitely order again! \n\n\n\n\n",

    "These cookies transport me back to my mornings in Italy!  As an Italian who lived there for years, I have fond memories of enjoying these with my espresso.  I was so disappointed not to find them in the Bay Area until now.  It's pure joy to savor these familiar flavors once again! \n",
    "These Macines biscotti evoke cherished memories of my time in Italy during the 1980s. A staple in Italian households, these simple yet delightful cookies are traditionally enjoyed for breakfast or as a midday snack.  Unavailable in the US at the time, I often returned from my trips with a prized supply.  \n\nThe aroma that wafts from a freshly opened bag is truly enticing.  For a delightful treat, I highly recommend pairing these biscotti with a glass of cold milk, a practice enjoyed by both children and adults alike in Italy. The biscotti, with their satisfying crunch, soften slightly when dipped in milk, creating a harmonious balance of textures and flavors. \n\nIt is gratifying to see that these authentic Italian biscotti are now accessible to a wider audience through online retailers like Amazon. \n",
    "Here's my experience with Holistic Select cat food after 9 months:\n\n**Initial Impressions:**\n\n* Heard positive feedback from a local pet store.\n* Both my cats, a 3-year-old female and a 6-year-old overweight male (who is notoriously picky), surprisingly enjoyed the food.\n* Appreciated the high-quality ingredients compared to typical \"junk\" cat food.\n\n**Long-Term Results:**\n\n* Upgraded from 4 to 5 stars!\n* Both cats are thriving.\n* My male cat still overeats a bit, but his weight is manageable.\n* My female cat is incredibly healthy, happy, and active.\n* Tried the chicken flavor, but my male cat preferred the sardine.\n* Ordered the duck flavor – stay tuned for an update.\n\n**Overall:**\n\nI highly recommend Holistic Select!  It's worth the higher price to provide my cats with nutritious, delicious food. \n\n\n",
    "I wanted to find healthier cat food for my one-year-old cat, who was already starting to seem a bit sluggish. I ditched the supermarket brands and, after browsing countless options at the pet store, decided to give this one a try.  \n\nBest decision ever!  My cat has been on this food for eight months, and he's back to his energetic kitten self! His coat is incredibly soft, and most importantly, he loves the taste!  I highly recommend this brand to everyone! \n\n\n\n\n",
    "After a lot of research (and a thumbs-up from my holistic vet!), I decided to try this food for my cat.  It's packed with good stuff, including probiotics applied to the kibble after cooking – a detail I love! Best of all, my cat went crazy for it!  She wouldn't even touch her old food anymore!  \n\n\n\n\n",
    "My 13-year-old cat, Cleo, was having digestive issues and losing weight.  Her vet recommended this food, and it's been a lifesaver!  She's no longer throwing up, and while she eats less overall, she seems much more satisfied after meals, which makes the higher price worth it.  \n\nAn unexpected but welcome bonus? No more stinky litter box issues! If your cat is experiencing similar problems, I highly recommend trying this food – it's made a world of difference for Cleo. \n",
    "Finding the right food for a cat with urinary tract issues can be a challenge, but this dry food has been a game-changer for my 4-year-old! Combined with wet food, water, and Uri Ease, it's kept his UTIs under control. Every time I try something else, his issues flare up.  Plus, my other cats love it too! It's a bit pricey, but the peace of mind and my cat's health are worth every penny!  \n\n\n\n\n",
    "Back in the day, I unknowingly let my cats develop a serious dry food addiction.  I always offered both wet and dry, but I wish I knew then what I know now about the importance of high-quality canned food. \n\nFast forward to now,  I have two senior cats (15 years young!) and two spry five-year-olds. They're all addicted to dry food, but I only give them the good stuff – Wellness and Innova.  \n\nRecently,  I started looking for a new option, and after offering my picky crew a smorgasbord of samples from our local holistic pet store, they finally gave another brand a paws up –  Holistic Select! \n\nIf you've got finicky felines at home, I highly recommend giving Holistic Select a try. It's high-quality, tastes great, and even my picky eaters approve! \n\n\n",
    "My cats love Holistic Select (especially the sardine flavor)!  It was vet-recommended, and the results speak for themselves –  shiny coats, bright eyes, and even less litter box odor!  Highly recommend for discerning cat parents! \n\n\n",
    "This is one of the few high-quality foods my cat with fish and beef allergies can eat! It surpasses even prescription diets! Both my cats are healthy, active, and have beautiful coats. Highly recommend! \n\n\n\n\n",
    "Our cats absolutely thrive on this dry food! We've noticed a significant decrease in hairballs, their coats are incredibly soft and shiny, and they're both at a healthy weight.  Plus, the shipping is lightning-fast!  This vendor is one of our Amazon favorites. \n\n\n",
    "I'm a huge fan of Hot & Spicy Maruchan Ramen – it's the perfect combination of spice and flavor! However, the price on Amazon is significantly higher than my local Walmart, where it's much more affordable.  \n\n\n",
    "As a lifelong ramen enthusiast and lover of all things spicy, I have to say that Hot & Spicy Chicken is my absolute favorite flavor!  It may not set my mouth on fire, but the taste is simply unbeatable! \n\n\n",
    "I love spicy food, but this ramen gives me terrible heartburn for hours.  Plus, it's much cheaper at Walmart. \n\n\n\n\n",
    "Ramen lovers rejoice! Get your fix delivered right to your door at a great price!  \n\n\n",
    "A conflagration in a bowl!  Alas, my tongue, a delicate flower, wilts in the face of such fiery wrath.  Flavor, once a welcome guest, is lost in the inferno, leaving only a searing memory. \n\n\n",
    "These ramen noodles pack a delicious spicy punch!  The broth, surprisingly, is the star of the show. Spice level is moderate –  good for those who like some heat, but not for extreme heat seekers. \n\n\n\n\n",
    "I snagged a steal on these spicy ramen cups –  half the price of my grocery store, which never seems to have the good flavors in stock, anyway.  They're a lifesaver in my office, where time disappears faster than donuts on a Monday morning. When I can't escape for a real meal, these hit the spot. It's my favorite instant ramen, and I'll be stocking up every time it goes on sale! \n\n\n",
    "Out of all the ramen flavors I've tried, this one is a clear winner! Stocking up again soon! \n\n\n",
    "This is my go-to ramen flavor!  Nothing else compares! While I love the convenience of Amazon Prime delivery, the price at my local grocery store is slightly cheaper.  But for those who value convenience, it's still a decent deal on Amazon! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "Elevate your ginger game with this incredible candied ginger!  It's unbelievably delicious –  perfectly capturing the spicy, fibrous essence of fresh ginger, balanced with just the right amount of sweetness.

    "A taste of Australia, delivered right to my doorstep!  I've searched high and low for authentic Australian ginger in my area, with no luck.

    "I confess, I've been lured by the siren song of cheaper candied ginger brands before.  But I always come crawling back to this one –  it's just that good!  Tender, moist, flavorful – it never disappoints. Trust me, your taste buds deserve this! \n\n\n\n\n",
    "This candied ginger has been a miracle for my son!  He's suffered from severe acid reflux since birth, and nothing seemed to help – until now!  After countless medications and remedies,  we were losing hope. \n\nThen, a kind stranger recommended this candied ginger. We were skeptical, but desperate enough to try anything.  To our astonishment,  his symptoms disappeared within days! He now enjoys his favorite foods without any discomfort.  This product has been a godsend for him – we're eternally grateful! \n\n\n\n\n",
    "We purchased this product to provide a convenient, bite-sized snack option for our office.  The individually wrapped pieces are ideal for portion control and ease of distribution.  However, we experienced an issue with one bag arriving damaged in transit.  \n\n\n\n\n",
    "Twizzlers beats the competition!  Black and cherry flavors are great, but strawberry is a bit bland. $2-2.50 per bag with free shipping is a good deal! \n\n\n\n\n",
    "I'm completely addicted to these! They're so tasty!  Buying the 6-pack on Amazon is a much better deal than Target – I save about a dollar per bag.  Subscribe & Save is a lifesaver! \n\n\n",
    "Don't be fooled by the quantity –  they've shrunk the size of the pieces!  It's a sneaky way to cut costs while making it seem like you're getting a good deal. The problem is, these tiny pieces have zero flavor. You have to stuff a handful in your mouth just to get a hint of taste.  Completely unacceptable! \n\n\n\n\n",
    "This salsa is a delicious alternative to Newman's Own Pineapple Salsa.  It features a smooth texture with small pieces of mango, making it enjoyable for those who prefer less chunky salsas.  The flavor profile is mild, with a touch of sweetness and a hint of spice.  The price point adds to its overall value.  \n\n\n\n\n",
    "**Damaged Product, Lack of Customer Support**\n\nWhile the salsa itself smelled delicious, all three bottles arrived with broken bottoms due to insufficient packaging.\n\nDespite the damage, I was informed that returns were not accepted for food items. Unfortunately, Amazon's redesigned website lacks a clear customer service contact option.\n\n**Packaging Concerns:**\n\nShipping fragile glass bottles of salsa in a cardboard box with minimal bubble wrap is highly inadequate.  Even with careful handling by FedEx, damage during transit is practically inevitable.  \n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n* Amazon should improve product packaging, especially for fragile items.\n* A readily accessible customer service contact option is essential for resolving such issues.\n\nSincerely, \n\nBarbara L.S. \n",
    "This particular salsa offers a delightful balance of flavors and textures, making it a standout choice.  However, the accompanying varieties included in the multi-pack are noticeably inferior, lacking the same complexity and freshness.  For optimal enjoyment, I recommend purchasing this flavor individually. \n\n\n\n\n",
    "These crackers have a distinct pumpkin and cinnamon flavor, reminiscent of homemade dog treats I once attempted (with less success, might I add!).  Personally, I find them a bit bland and not my favorite offering from Back to Nature.  However, my fiancé absolutely adores them, hence the three-star rating. It seems taste preferences, like so many things in life, are subjective! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "This cornmeal is of exceptional quality, producing outstanding results in a variety of applications. I used it to prepare both traditional baked cornbread and hot water cornbread, both of which were exceptional.  Additionally, I employed this cornmeal as a coating for fried oysters, which yielded a delightfully crispy texture and enhanced flavor. \n\n\n\n\n",
    "This marinade is simply superb! I find it to be a particularly excellent complement to chicken, enhancing its flavor profile whether baked or grilled. It has garnered much praise from guests at dinner parties, attesting to its culinary merit. This product offers exceptional value, being both highly affordable and remarkably easy to use. \n\n\n\n\n",

    "This canned tuna product, characterized by a \"best by\" date of 21 months from the date of purchase, offers a convenient and flavorful meal or snack option.  The combination of tuna and tomato sauce is well-balanced, providing a satisfying savory experience.  \n\nA visual representation of this product's contents can be found in the accompanying video, though the footage suffers from suboptimal focus due to limitations with the recording equipment.  Despite its shortcomings, the video provides a general overview of the tuna and tomato combination. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "Esteemed colleagues, allow me to draw your attention to these exceptional tuna pouches.  In my considered opinion, they represent the pinnacle of flavor within their product category. They serve as a convenient and agreeable on-the-go snack, and the inclusion of tomato elevates them to a truly satisfying culinary experience. \n\n\n\n\n",
    "I embarked on a culinary adventure, straying from my trusty Star-Kist tuna in pursuit of new taste horizons. Alas, this particular voyage proved less than fruitful.  The tuna, awash in a sea of basil and spices, overwhelmed my palate, leaving a lingering memory better forgotten. \n\n\n\n\n",
    "As a tuna lover, I'm always up for trying new brands, so I gave Safcol a go.  The tuna itself seems high-quality, but the tomato basil flavor was a bit underwhelming for my taste. It's good if you prefer a milder flavor, but I was hoping for a bit more oomph! If you're looking for a healthy and convenient meal option, though, it's still a solid choice. \n\n\n\n\n",
    "This tuna with tomato and basil is a delicious step up from plain tuna pouches. It's flavorful enough to enjoy straight from the pouch, but I recommend giving it a quick, gentle warm-up in the microwave to really enhance the flavors! \n\n\n",
    "This tuna was unbelievably bland!  There are tons of tastier options out there. With 100 calories, I guess it's slightly better than a sugary snack bar, but be prepared to drown it in seasonings just to make it edible.  \n\n\n\n\n",
    "Intrigued by tales of pomegranate molasses' unique flavor, I had to experience it myself.  Even eaten straight from the jar, it's a revelation! This dark, luscious syrup is a symphony of sour and sweet, with a hint of something almost metallic that's both intriguing and addictive. A small taste is all it takes to satisfy my sweet cravings. I can't wait to unlock its full potential in a batch of fesenjan!  \n\n\n\n\n",
    "Pomegranate molasses is an incredibly versatile ingredient! I've used it to add a complex, tangy sweetness to Moroccan tagines, create unique and flavorful cocktails, and even drizzle it over orange slices soaked in orange water for a simple yet elegant dessert.

    "These beans were completely unacceptable! They were so old that half of them were inedible, with damaged skins indicating their staleness.  Now I'm stuck with pounds of unusable beans and no recourse, as food items are non-returnable.  I'll be taking my business elsewhere! \n\n\n\n\n",
    "The bulk candy assortment itself was satisfactory. However, I was disappointed to find that the Banana Heads candies were significantly smaller than standard Banana Runts.

The cake's size is remarkable, providing ample portions for a family to savor over multiple breakfasts.\n\nThe texture is divine – a delightful balance of density and sponginess, yielding a moist and satisfying bite.  The flavors are truly exceptional, with warm cinnamon notes permeating every crumb, complemented beautifully by the sweet vanilla and sticky icing.  Paired with a cup of coffee, it's the perfect start to the day! \n\n\n",
    "I used to love the intense flavor of this lemon juice, but it seems to have become more diluted over the years. It's still a good product, but now tastes similar to cheaper brands.  I miss the strong, flavorful punch it used to have. \n\n\n\n\n",
    "\"This is hands-down one of the best lemon juices I've ever used!  I'm totally hooked! It's so fresh and flavorful, and a lifesaver when fresh lemons aren't in season. I'll definitely be stocking up!\" \n",
    "Unleash the power of citrus!  This lemon juice is a kitchen essential, adding a burst of fresh, vibrant flavor to every dish. A little goes a long way!  I even add a splash to my water for a refreshing boost. This is a pantry hero I'll buy again and again! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "This lemon juice concentrate is a kitchen staple! It arrived quickly and is identical to the kind found in grocery stores.  Having it on hand makes cooking a breeze – no more squeezing fresh lemons for every recipe or scrambling to keep them in stock!  It's perfect for adding a bright, citrusy punch to sauces, dressings, marinades, and more. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "I was hoping for a taste of sunshine in a bottle, but this lemon juice fell a little short. It's decent, but there's a slightly off-putting aftertaste, possibly from a preservative.  I much prefer the vibrant flavor of frozen lemon juice, but alas, it seems that option is elusive for now. \n\n\n\n\n",
    "Don't believe the hype about this drink being relaxing? Oh, believe me, it's true! Consider yourself warned –  this beverage should only be consumed when you're ready for a serious snooze-fest. \n\nA few sips in, and a wave of tranquility washes over you.  It's like a warm hug for your nervous system!  My limbs feel pleasantly heavy, my eyelids grow heavy... and then, I'm off to dreamland!  It's that potent. \n\n\n\n\n",
    "Hold your horses, folks! This tea is decent – not mind-blowing, but a perfectly acceptable thirst-quencher.  However, $38 for a case?  No way! I found the same thing at Grocery Outlet for a steal – $4 a case!  That's right, practically a dollar for three bottles! I'll stock up when the price is right, but this markup is outrageous! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "This sleep aid is a game-changer!  The taste is incredible, and it works like a charm!  Sweet dreams are made of this! \n\n\n\n\n",
    "We're always searching for natural ways to combat stress and improve our sleep.  While yoga would probably be ideal, this sleep tonic has become our new secret weapon! \n\nIt works wonders! I only needed half a bottle the first night to experience its sleep-inducing powers. Within 30 minutes, I was drifting off to dreamland.  And the best part? I woke up feeling refreshed and alert, without that groggy \"sleep-drug\" feeling.  \n\nThe only downside? The packaging was a disaster.  Two of the glass bottles arrived broken, which, at this price, is a significant loss.  They really need to improve their packaging game!\n\nOverall, the product itself deserves a resounding five stars, but due to the packaging fail, I had to knock off a couple. \n\n\n\n\n",
    "BRM Garbanzo Bean Flour makes amazing chocolate chip cookies!  They're chewy, delicious, and virtually indistinguishable from traditional cookies.  The bean flour adds a boost of protein and fiber, making them extra satisfying.  Highly recommend! \n\n\n",
    "This flour was impossible to find in stores, so we were thrilled to find it online!  Fast delivery and no more searching empty grocery store aisles –  hooray for online shopping!  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "This glaze is a must-have for creating beautiful and delicious fresh fruit tarts!  Simply bake your preferred tart base (sponge cake, pate sucre, or even pie crust), arrange fresh fruit slices on top, and pour over the prepared glaze. It sets at room temperature, creating a glossy, stable layer that showcases the vibrant fruit. \n\nThis glaze is also perfect for topping cheesecakes with a stunning layer of fruit. Simply arrange sliced fruit on the cheesecake while it's still in the springform pan, pour over the glaze, let it set, and then remove the pan.  \n\nThe vegan ingredients make it suitable for a wide range of dietary needs, including vegan tofu cheesecakes and fruit tarts with nut-based crusts.  If you enjoy baking, this versatile glaze is an essential pantry item. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "This product worked wonders for my Scotties' hot spots! Within a week, they were completely gone. The smell is a bit strong, but not unpleasant.  I'd say it's definitely worth it for the results! \n\n\n\n\n",
    "I was drawn to this coffee because it's a more affordable alternative to Ganocafe, while still containing organic reishi mushroom and other beneficial antioxidants. I wasn't expecting much in terms of flavor, but it's surprisingly delicious!  At just $5, it's an incredible value.  I'm excited to share it with my sisters who are loyal Ganocafe drinkers. I'll post an update after trying it for a few weeks! \n",
    "I understand wanting to branch out and try new coffees, and it's great that you're exploring different options! This one, however, might not be your cup of tea (or coffee, in this case!). The flavor is decent, but it sounds like you have favorites that you enjoy more. The \"vitaminy\" taste and price are understandable drawbacks.  It's all about finding what works best for you!  \n\n\n\n\n",
    "This organic coffee is delicious and healthy! It's made with pesticide-free ingredients and includes ganoderma for its potential health benefits. \n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "This instant coffee is delicious! One of the best I've tried. If you're looking for another flavorful option (though not organic), I also recommend Africafe pure instant coffee. \n\n\n\n\n",
    "I totally get it - the packaging can make a difference!  It's frustrating when a zip-lock pouch fails, especially for a product you love.  It's awesome that you've found a coffee that gives you energy without the jitters – that's a big win! Hopefully, the company will consider a more durable packaging option in the future. \n\n\n\n\n",
    "These sugar-free mints are delicious and perfect for freshening breath after meals, especially salads! The bulk bag is a great value. Highly recommend! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "While I prefer these to regular Altoids, they're pricier, so make sure you really love the flavor before committing! \n\n\n\n\n",
    "These sugar-free mints are a great deal! The tins are perfect for on-the-go freshness, and they're healthier for your teeth than sugary mints. Highly recommend! \n\n\n\n\n",
    "Upgrade your breath-freshening game with these amazing mints!  Great packaging, fast shipping, incredible price, and a long shelf life - what more could you ask for? The flavor is perfect – not too intense, and made with real mint.  Ditch the powdery stuff and experience true minty freshness! \n\n\n\n\n",
    "These mints are powerfully refreshing and flavorful!  Their compact size makes them perfect for carrying in a pocket or purse. \n\n\n\n\n",
    "This bulk pack provides a massive supply of mints, making it a far more cost-effective option than frequent individual purchases. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "These mint tins are deceptively small, filled less than halfway.  The high price feels like a rip-off for such a small quantity.  It's disappointing to see yet another example of misleading packaging and questionable practices from manufacturers.  \n\n\n\n\n\n"
