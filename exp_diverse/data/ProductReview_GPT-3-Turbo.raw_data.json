    "If you decide to eat here, just be aware it is going to take about 2 hours from beginning to end. We have tried it multiple times, because I want to like it! I have been to it's other locations in NJ and never had a bad experience.   The food is good, but it takes a very long time to come out. The waitstaff is very young, but usually pleasant. We have just had too many experiences where we spent way too long waiting. We usually opt for another diner or restaurant on the weekends, in order to be done quicker.",
    "I've taken a lot of spin classes over the years, and nothing compares to the classes at Body Cycle. From the nice, clean space and amazing bikes, to the welcoming and motivating instructors, every class is a top notch work out.  For anyone who struggles to fit workouts in, the online scheduling system makes it easy to plan ahead (and there's no need to line up way in advanced like many gyms make you do).  There is no way I can write this review without giving Russell, the owner of Body Cycle, a shout out. Russell's passion for fitness and cycling is so evident, as is his desire for all of his clients to succeed. He is always dropping in to classes to check in/provide encouragement, and is open to ideas and recommendations from anyone. Russell always wears a smile on his face, even when he's kicking your butt in class!",
    "Family diner. Had the buffet. Eclectic assortment: a large chicken leg, fried jalapeño, tamale, two rolled grape leaves, fresh melon. All good. Lots of Mexican choices there. Also has a menu with breakfast served all day long. Friendly, attentive staff. Good place for a casual relaxed meal with no expectations. Next to the Clarion Hotel.",
    "Wow!  Yummy, different,  delicious.   Our favorite is the lamb curry and korma.  With 10 different kinds of naan!!!  Don't let the outside deter you (because we almost changed our minds)...go in and try something new!   You'll be glad you did!",
    "Cute interior and owner (?) gave us tour of upcoming patio/rooftop area which will be great on beautiful days like today. Cheese curds were very good and very filling. Really like that sandwiches come w salad, esp after eating too many curds! Had the onion, gruyere, tomato sandwich. Wasn't too much cheese which I liked. Needed something else...pepper jelly maybe. Would like to see more menu options added such as salads w fun cheeses. Lots of beer and wine as well as limited cocktails. Next time I will try one of the draft wines.",
    "I am a long term frequent customer of this establishment. I just went in to order take out (3 apps) and was told they're too busy to do it. Really? The place is maybe half full at best. Does your dick reach your ass? Yes? Go fuck yourself! I'm a frequent customer AND great tipper. Glad that Kanella just opened. NEVER going back to dmitris!",
    "Loved this tour! I grabbed a groupon and the price was great. It was the perfect way to explore New Orleans for someone who'd never been there before and didn't know a lot about the history of the city. Our tour guide had tons of interesting tidbits about the city, and I really enjoyed the experience. Highly recommended tour. I actually thought we were just going to tour through the cemetery, but she took us around the French Quarter for the first hour, and the cemetery for the second half of the tour. You'll meet up in front of a grocery store (seems strange at first, but it's not terribly hard to find, and it'll give you a chance to get some water), and you'll stop at a visitor center part way through the tour for a bathroom break if needed. This tour was one of my favorite parts of my trip!",
    "Amazingly amazing wings and homemade bleu cheese. Had the ribeye: tender, perfectly prepared, delicious. Nice selection of craft beers. Would DEFINITELY recommend checking out this hidden gem.",
    "This easter instead of going to Lopez Lake we went to Los Padres National Forest which is really pretty but if you go to white rock the staff needs to cut down all the dead grass that invades the rock and the water. I would wish the staff would also clean or get rid of the dead grass that's also living by the water. The water is really green and dirty. Los padres national forest staff need to work hard to maintain this forest looking pretty and not like a dumpster. Even Cachuma lake looks like they put a bit more effort.",
    "Had a party of 6 here for hibachi. Our waitress brought our separate sushi orders on one plate so we couldn't really tell who's was who's and forgot several items on an order. I understand making mistakes but the restaraunt was really quiet so we were kind of surprised. Usually hibachi is a fun lively experience and our  cook  said maybe three words, but he cooked very well his name was Francisco. Service was fishy, food was pretty good, and im hoping it was just an off night here. But for the money I wouldn't go back.",
    "My experience with Shalimar was nothing but wonderful.  I wanted to get my engagement ring sized and was told over the phone that it could probably be done within the day.  When I brought it by, the team confirmed that the jeweler would be able to accommodate my same-day request and that it would be around $40 (simple band, decrease by three full sizes). I checked my size one more time, confirmed, and left to let them do their thing. When I came to pick up later that afternoon, the ring was too small. It's very important to note that Shalimar sized the ring perfectly, but that I made a mistake and should've gone up a half-size. The Shalimar group were completely understanding and accommodating, even resizing my ring back up and getting it back to me within an hour at no charge! Even though it was my mistake! The associates' attitudes in dealing with what was a pretty embarrassing situation instantly earned my satisfaction and loyalty as a customer. Very grateful for such a wonderful experience.",
    "Locals recommended Milktooth, and it's an amazing jewel of Indianapolis. I'm glade I had the chance to experience this.",
    "Love going here for happy hour or dinner!  Great patio with fans to beat the StL heat!   Also...very accomodating at this location.  I like the Veal Milanese but with mixed greens instead of pasta!  they'll modify the menu to suit your taste!",
    "Good food--loved the gnocchi with marinara the baked eggplant appetizer was very good too  The service was very slow, but despite this, I'd go back, the food is just that good",
    "The bun makes the Sonoran Dog. It's like a snuggie for the pup. A first, it seems ridiculous and almost like it's going to be too much, exactly like everyone's favorite blanket with sleeves. Too much softness, too much smush, too indulgent.  Wrong. It's warm, soft, chewy, fragrant, and it succeeds where other famed Sonoran Dogs fail.   The hot dog itself is flavorful, but I would prefer that it or the bacon have a little more bite or snap to better hold their own against the dominant mustard and onions.   I'm with the masses on the carne asada caramelo. Excellent tortilla, salty, melty cheese, and great carne.   Super cheap and you can drive through.",
    "Great place for breakfast! I had the waffle, which was fluffy and perfect, and home fries which were nice and smashed and crunchy. Friendly waitstaff. Will definitely be back!",
    "Tremendous service (Big shout out to Douglas) that complemented the delicious food. Pretty expensive establishment (40-50$ avg for your main course), but its definitely backs that up with an atmosphere that's comparable with any of the top tier restaurants across the country.",
    "The hubby and I have been here on multiple occasions and we have loved every part of the meal, every single time. Everyone from the servers to the bartender is very knowledgable about the menu and was able to immediately recommend items I could eat as-is, substitute or delete to make something safe for this Celiac girl to eat. The wine and cocktail menus are spot on. The food divine.  My only wish is that they would have a gluten-free dessert, we've always had to go elsewhere for something sweet. But that is not a big deal and I still want to go here time and time again.",
    "I go to blow bar to get my brows done by natalie (brow specialist) which i highly recommend she is great does a great job on my eyebrows! But then i got a blow by victoria!! Wow i was impress i have thin, straight, dead hair and she left me with the biggest volume ive ever had!!! Tried another girl but didnt like it as much so victoria will be my girl for ever; very beautiful clean place!!!",
    "My absolute favorite cafe in the city. Their black and white latte is probably the best I've ever had (not too sweet and just the right amount of foam), soups are always really good (even for non-soup people) and there's just a lot of space to do work. The noise level is perfect, the music is at a perfect level, and I always enjoy when patrons bring their dogs. I'll keep giving them my business for as long as I can.",
    "HOLY SMOKES!  actual pumpkin pie mixed in with the frozen custard......are you kidding me? Why hasn't this become a huge sweep the nation treat.   The best part was the chunks of pie crust. Like finding a diamond inside another diamond. Super yummy.",
    "Upland is a brewery based out of Bloomington, Indiana that has become popular enough to open up a couple additional locations in central Indiana.  All of their beers are very good, and I am also a fan of their burgers and tenderloins.  Therefore, I was excited to try their pizza, but I don't think it ended up being on par with these other items.  My margherita pizza had a cracker-like crust and was pretty light overall.  The cheese was good, but none of the other toppings added much flavor.  There was no red sauce as is typical for a true margherita pizza.  My opinion is that Upland's pizza might serve as a nice appetizer for a group, but I'll be sticking with their burgers or tenderloins as my meal of choice on future visits.",
    "I thoroughly enjoyed the show.  Chill way to spend a Friday night.",
    "Yes, this is the only sushi place in town. However, it is great when you're craving sushi and don't have time to go somewhere else. The salmon is probably the best fish they have, so we always order salmon. We also love their spicy edamame, tempura, ocean salad, and cabbage salad. Service has always been friendly and quick!",
    "I was really between 3 and 4 stars for this one. I LOVE the 96th street Naked Tchopstix so I was very excited to see this one which is closer to my house. The vibe is totally different as this is geared more to take out although they do have a decent size dining area. You order at the counter and they deliver it. My daughter and I tried the sushi bowl. You pick up a piece of paper and  select from a choice of proteins, vegetables, rice and toppings. I like the fact that it is on paper and you don't have to guess what things are or have to shout over the counter to tell the server what you want. The sushi bowl was good but not wonderful. The choices particularly of the vegetables seemed a little too limiting and I felt I had more rice than other food items. The sauces were tasty. My husband ordered the Maui roll which is my favorite roll at the 96th street location and this just was not up that standard. It was good but the quality and consistently was not as good as at 96th street. I would go back though and I think a lot of people would be happy with the sushi bowls. I do want to make a comment about the low reviews that people have given the place because of service. People - it is a sushi place - it isn't McDonalds- so it will be a bit slower. You are not going to order and get out of there in five minutes even though it is called express. As a healthy alternative to fast food in the area, it is worth the wait. Oh and try the bubble tea. I had the strawberry and it was quite yummy. Next time I am going to try the vanilla chai.",
    "Went for lunch. Beef brisket sandwich was awesome.   So juicy and tender.    Pulled pork was was just as good!",
    "Best thai food in the area.  Everything was authentic and delicious.  Will definitely be back again and again.",
    "Service was crappy, and food was mediocre.  I wish I would have picked some other place for my last dinner in town.",
    "I recently had dinner here with my wife over the weekend and could not have been more pleased!   Our meal was excellent! My wife and I were astounded by how quickly our food came out! Everything tasted fresh and homemade which we both appreciated.   The only problem was trying to pick something from the menu as there were too many delicious sounding items to choose from. We will definitely be returning to try more items! Can't wait to see what the next chef specials will be!",
    "I at least have to give this restaurant two stars due to the decent food. But while on a dinner meeting and after spending $100 on entrées and appetizers, I had to flag down the assistant cook, (the guy in bright red baggy pants watching TV), to see if I could get more avocado for my tuna entrée.  He made it very apparent and direct that he could not help me with that situation and I would have to flag down my  waitress so she could bill me for the four dollar avocado.",
    "First time there and it was excellent!!! It feels like your are entering someone's home. The waiters there funny and nice. The food come out very quickly and it is phenomenal!!! Definitely will be going back to this place.",
    "Great burgers,fries and salad!  Burgers have a hint of salt and pepper flavor.  This location is very quaint. They only have outdoor seating  Friendly staff.  Street parking as well as parking lot in the back.",
    "Great staff always helps and always nice. Always clean and huge store size. Stays stocked with everything you need. The staff always helps make my custom breakfast bagel",
    "Took my vehicle here for some work a few years ago for a manufacturer recall. Problem went away and then started hearing another noise which I thought was related, but turned out was a completely different issue. Kevin and his mechanic lifted my car right up and fixed the issue FREE OF CHARGE even though I told them I'd pay. Outstanding individuals for doing that. Highly recommend!",
    "After my ROTD  yesterday of a different Sweet CeCe's location, I realized that I had never reviewed my local source!  Anyway, I love the product.  Love love love.  And I usually like their selection of toppings - good mix between healthy and not-so-healthy.  Sometimes the girls working there aren't really paying attention or are nowhere to be found.  Sometimes you have to remind them of their deals (like $5 Friday).  But I can't give it less than 4 stars because I just love it so much.",
    "What a great addition to the Funk Zone!  Grab a bite, grab some tastings, life is good. Right next door to the Santa Barbara Wine Collective, in fact it actually shares the same tables.  We had a fabulous savory croissant.",
    "Nice relaxing place to get a massage! Same day appointments are easy to come by! I have never been disappointed with any therapist I have had at the Center!",
    "We checked in around 2:30 pm.  Check-in was quick and easy with complimentary valet parking (always appreciated).  The Peppermill is huge and reminded us of the Caesars Palace in Las Vegas.  They have around eight restaurants on site offering almost any type of food you could want.  The casino area is huge, rivaling almost anything you could find in Las Vegas.  One thing we noticed is that many of the slot machines were noted as being penny machines, but when you actually started to play them you realized they had minimum bets of anywhere from 30 cents to $5.  Talk about false advertising!  We were in the Tuscany Tower on the 12th floor.  Our room had a nice view of the huge pool area.  Our room was large and featured free WiFi (likewise always appreciated), a huge bathroom area with large shower (with two shower heads), TV, a large jetted bathtub and a phone next to the commode.  There were dual sinks and lots of counter space.  Plenty of towels were supplied.  The roomy main area had a king bed with night stands, closet, TV, mini fridge, dresser with two drawers, a safe, table for computer or writing, complimentary bottles of water, and three nicely upholstered chairs and table.  The thermostat did a good job controlling the temperature and keeping it comfortable.  Staff were all courteous and helpful.  A very nice place and we enjoyed our stay.",
    "My boyfriend and I tried this deli for the first time today. I had a turkey, avocado & bacon panini and he ha a buffalo chicken wrap. We will definitely be returning. The wait for food wasn't too long, which is always appreciated during lunch hour. There was SO much to choose from. They have salads, soup, macaroni, sandwiches and hot food. I love a deli that has many options to choose from!",
    "Amazing biscuits and (fill in the blank). Great cocktails too. Highly recommended. A bit busy though.",
    "Food was good- atmosphere/decor is like a fishing lodge- menu is someplace between outback & bonefish. Went on a Groupon & all 3 of our meals & calamari appetizer that we ordered were cooked perfectly- we will def be back.",
    "Straight to the point, it's cheap, it tastes and feels cheap  The good: price, location, dessert (edible food items are: baked chicken, fried chicken, mashed potatoes, Salad bar lol, meat and cheese bar, ravioli, pizza) also our waitress was bomb af  The meh: behind counter meat slicing station, shrimp (not even deveined), Mexican station  The bad: breakfast -worst eggs ever, actually worst, eggs. Le Benedict can't even cut through ham or English muffin (tried on all 3 occasions), steak, shrimp again, hell breaded items can't even, don't even. Decor it's the 1970 nightmare you can imagine  Tried 3 times and failed",
    "The only reason I didn't give this restaurant a 5 star rating, is because of one single pretentious waiter. As a 4 night guest at Hotel Palomar, the location of the restaurant is an obvious plus. The first night of my stay, I met a coworker in the restaurant for a cocktail. When we arrived, the host staff were busy and not available, so we just walked in. The restaurant was not too busy, so we just looked at a small table next to the bar and proceeded to take a seat. A waiter came by and I quickly asked if we could have a seat, before sitting down and told him we'd only be having cocktails. He stumbled on his reply, and in an irritated/in-convinced tone, told me \"I guess it would be fine\" and basically just kept walking mid sentence. My guest and I brushed it off, and started having a conversation while looking at the drink menu. To make a long story short, he was distant and we both got the \"couldn't be bothered\" vibe from him. When it came to the bill, we asked if it could be split due to company transaction policies, and you would have thought asked him for some inconceivable task. We basically spent the rest of our night and elevator ride to our room in shock of the rudeness we had just experienced.   Although that situation left a bad taste in our mouth, and the night before we decided to avoid the restaurant, we decided to grab another cocktail and give this place one more try. After looking around and ensuring \"last nights waiter\" wasn't on shift, we walked over to the bar and started looking over the menu. Instantly, the bartender greeted us with pleasant small talk and made us feel 100% welcome. He asked about our day, recommended cocktails and was a completely genuine person. This guy (I think his name was Ben) is an absolute star! He gave us lessons on Whiskey, described how to make classic cocktails, and was 100% invested in our experience. This is exactly what a bartender at a 4/5 star establishment should be - actually he exceeds that. He was kind, funny, friendly and completely redeemed this restaurant/bar from our terrible experience the night before.  I also ordered room service last night from this restaurant, and it was amazing. The bacon wrapped dates and chocolate cake are to die for! Great restaurant and amazing bartender(s). Too bad one bad egg could have spoiled this experience.",
    "Stopped by after a Sunday morning walk in the park - great food, coffee customer service - love the vibe in here",
    "In a word... \"OVERRATED!\".  The food took forever to come out.  The burger was WAY overcooked (Especially when I ordered it Medium Rare) and the Seafood Jumbalaya was Decent.  Not worth the price.  There are better places to eat in the french quarter.  It was not horrible, but for everything that we had heard about this place, I would have expected much better.",
    "Comfortable bed, good breakfast, fast internet, great location, and low price. Overall I was really impressed with this place. However, if you stay on the top floors you may be waiting up to 15 minutes for an elevator in the morning.",
    "NEVER AGAIN. This is a so called restaurant that does nothing that a restaurant should other than prepare food, because the rest is done by the patron. Want water? Get up and go across the yard to get it. Want a drink, walk up a flight of stairs and pay cash. Want to sit in a dirty yard in dirty lawn chairs, enjoy yourself. The wait staff is mildy helpful in that they bring you your food after you go to the window and pay cash for it...kind of like New Orleans Hamburger and Seafood, but dirty and with live music (which is nice). It's a one in a lifetime experience for me...just once.",
    "If you want to pay for everything a la carte this is the place for you.   Food wasn't terrible not impressive. They brought a basket of chips and some tomato sauce which I asked politely for something spicier and some pico de gallo.  She brought them happily to me and the salsa was much better.  When asked what we would like to drink I asked for a coke and she brought out a bottle which I stated I wanted the fountain drink.  She said \"oh that's only Pepsi\".  Never mentioned that they only had bottle drinks for coke.   We ordered our food which was reasonably priced, asked for sour cream and also to put cheese on the taco.  She let us know cheese was extra.   It was $2.50 extra for another basket of chips.   When I received the bill we paid more for the condiments then the actual food.  Side of sour cream 2.00, pico de gallo 2.50, salsa 2.00, chips 2.50, cheese 1.00 and the bottled coke that we didn't want 5.00.   Just a suggestion...when you order anything make sure to ask if there is an extra charge.",
    "The cafe was extremely cute. We came at 8am and they even had a jazz band playing at that time. I got the breakfast sandwich and it was delicious. I loved how they rolled the egg and put the bacon pieces inside. Great price for a filling breakfast!",
    "On a scale of one to things that are awesome, this place is the bomb.   I was drawn in by the promise of the duckfat frenchfries. Took the boy for his birthday and put our name in, had a drink around the corner while we waited and were given seats at the bar after about 45 minutes.   We were waited on by Keith, the bartender, who was congenial, knowledgeable about his whiskeys and an all-around cool guy. We started with 3 cape may salts (two for me, one for the boy) and tater tots, both of which made me happy.  For dinner, I got Kentucky Fried Quail (stellar, though the succotash was not as exciting as I wanted it to be) and the boy got the 24$ Fois Gras burger, which was incredible. Worth every penny. The duckfat fries were pretty yummy, but not even the best part of the meal. I could've done without the cheese sauce, but as it was on the side I wasn't deterred.  I look forward to coming back here, with everyone I know.",
    "We started with the artichoke dip, big mistake. It was cold and the chips were stale. Mentioned to our waitress, but nothing came of it.  We ordered a large pizza, thin crust which after adding toppings it was a bit pricey for pizza.  Pizza was ok, not great. Except for not being our advocate our server was good.  I have been here before for Cardinals game, it was better then. Will try another venue next time.",
    "It was my fiance's birthday and he decided he wanted a good, laid back Thai restaurant for dinner. Yelp steered us in the Jasmine Rice direction, and it was definitely a good decision. We wanted the summer rolls, which were on the menu, but apparently will not be available until summer, so we settled on the pan-fried dumplings. The flavor was good, but I don't think we'd order them again. We got the green curry fried rice with duck and chicken pad thai. Both of those dishes were great, but the duck stole the show. That was some the of tastiest duck I've ever had. The pad thai was a bit sweet for us, so I think we'd try a different noodle dish when we return. But it was still very good, especially with some chili sauce mixed in. Our service was good, but other people had issues. One table was rushing to get to a show at the Kimmel Center and waited quite a while for their meal (and were going to be late). Another person who got take-out was missing one of their items (but the owner realized it and called him and walked the dish to his house, which was very nice). Overall, good quality Thai! We would definitely go back.",
    "I absolutely love Courtney! She is hands down the best hairstylist I have ever had. The reason I think she is so great is that she knows what will look best on me and over the past year has understood my limits for styles. I always go into the salon and tell her to cut my hair how she thinks will look best, and I always leave blown away at what she does. You know you have a great stylist when you don't have to specify what you want done, but instead they see what needs to be done. Great stylist, great personality and very knowledgeable. I would highly recommend her to anyone who wants to look their best.",
    "I've been to this location many times when I lived in the area and although it is a chain and not exactly sexy, it does the job on many occasions.   If you need an oil change, this place is ok, if you need a state inspection this place does it.   The key is getting there when they are not busy or else you will wait.     Again, nothing fancy here a pep boys is a pep boys but all in all decent stuff.",
    "Replaced 2 old 70s lennox with 2 new ones.  They did a great job and have been runnong for 3 years now.",
    "I love the Brewpub for their variety of dishes.  Nachos, pizza and sandwiches.  Variety of beers to choose from crafted right on sight.    Every time we go, the service is slow.  I think it's just the pace of the restaurant.  It's never a quick beer and a bite of food.  Instead, enjoy the patio and friends, savor that time.    Kid and dog friendly environment.  Also great for your vegetarian and vegan friends.    My go to is a half order of the nachos or fish & chips.    Tried their Pumpkin Seasonal Beer and it's on par with some of my favorite pumpkins.",
    "Farmhouse, rustic, chic.Helpful staff with great ideas to decorate your home. Prices reasonable. Store has items from Joanna Gaines ( Fixer Upper) and much more. Finally a good home store in SB with reasonable prices.",
    "My brother came to visit and we wanted to pick up a six pack of good beers for a night in. Ended up staying and having a few while playing their Nintendo 64 (Super Smash Brothers, which the owner said was donated by fellow patrons). It's a great place with good food and genuinely nice people. Should be a staple in the Northeast.",
    "My go to menu is coconut soup and pad thai with protein. I tried same menu here.  Actually really like their coconut soup. They used enough amount of coconut milk that soup was really creamy and wasn't over powering with herb. I am so used to Americanized thai cuisine that I prefer less herb on my dish except cilantro. Pat thai was great too. Liked the amount of peanut they used, noodle was chewy and perfect and not too sweet. They gave me generous amount of chicken and white meat wasn't dry so I was very happy with my meal.",
    "Excellent service! Great diner food and breakfast is served all day. Came here for lunch- they were busy but very friendly and hospitable. Easy to get to off the 295.",
    "My go-to spot on a Saturday night! I was real bummed that lucys closed, but was pleasantly surprised by this bar just across the street! Their food is better than expected. I always get wings and fries. (be careful of the wtf sauce though) Sometimes it takes a real long time to get the bartenders attention, but the place is usually packed. And if you're lucky the always sunny crew will pop in!",
    "We were a bit weary about trying the Shellfish Company on the Wharf as more often than not, many places like these (see Cannery Row, Monterey) feast on a captive audience and provide sub-standard fare at high prices.  However, emboldened by the perennial good reviews on Yelp, we suppressed our initial observations and went ahead with the trying it out. The place is small, so definitely plan ahead. You will have to wait, so either you know, just do so, or perhaps try to visit outside of peak hours. Luckily, our wait was only about 20 minutes as the dinner rush was just leveling off.  The special was the local rock crab - $25 for 3 lbs of California Rock Crab, salad, and your choice of soup/chowder. After taking a look at a few trays of rock crab being served out, the wife and I both opted for it, as it looked awesome.    The salad/chowder combo was great as you actually received hearty portions of each, so it was a good start. As much as I liked the chowder however, the Shrimp Bisque the wife ordered was amazing, so I would recommend that going forward.   But enough of prattling on about side dishes: the rock crab tasted just as glorious as it looked. Juicy, buttery chunks of white crab meat await you, just a few cracks away. While the rock crab shells are pretty thick, once cracked, they splinter and separate easily, a good sign they are cooked to perfection. The rock crabs provided a great amount of meat for what I felt to be the least amount of work you're going to do for crab, King or otherwise.   We were thoroughly satisfied with our meal and along with the special being an overall great value, devouring the Rock Crab at SBSC turned out to be one of the favorite meals on the trip. I think ordering crab here is a safe proposition indeed.",
    "I LOVE Weaver's Way and really disagree with some of the content in previous reviews. WW is not necessarily meant for convenience shopping. I am a single woman and I find that I have no trouble shopping at the co-op, during peak times or otherwise. I actually find the co-op to be a great place to shop if you live alone because I can get smaller quantities of items than if I shop at the corporate stores like Acme. I also enjoy the work hours - I've worked throughout the store, but most recently, I have been getting in my hours by participating in the membership committee. I wouldn't say that the community is necessarily made up of \"tree huggers\" and \"earth children\", though. The community is made up of a variety of similarly-minded folks from different backgrounds. I enjoy having a place to go to where I can obtain locally grown produce, a place that offers more natural, wholesome, and preservative-free foods than chain stores with prices way below that of Whole Foods. I enjoy interacting with other members and contributing to my local and global community. I don't find the membership fee or the work hours to be prohibitive being a single person vs. a family. I don't think that membership in a co-op is for everyone and, if you aren't single, it's definitely not a solo decision. If you're keen on being committed to the Weaver Way values, you couldn't find a better place to shop. If not, stick to the chain stores or just pay the 10% visitors' fee to pop in once in a while.",
    "Honestly the food doesn't knock my socks off but other people seem to love this place. I go because my husband likes it as for me I'd rather go to a different BBQ spot. I guess it also depends on what you order.",
    "The TV shows are $4.99 and they have commercials! What a cheesy way to make money and a sign of a less than classy hotel, particularly when you pay more than $150 a night.  And there is NO complimentary breakfast, just an overpriced buffet, something even the cheapest hotels in California provide.",
    "I stopped here because it was by the hotel I was staying in. The guys working at the shop were super nice and friendly. I really like the buy one get one deal they do. I also ordered some hot wings and they were pretty good. They had a ton of sauce on them which is awesome. Next time I come back to town I will be sure to stop here for some more pizza!",
    "I've only had the cannolis here but they are awesome! They're freshly filled when ordered and the filling is phenomenal. Not too sweet, it's perfect. If you like cannoli, if you don't think you like cannoli, you should definitely get one from Termini Bros.",
    "Traveling through in our RV, stopped over in Granite City. Found this little gem of a cafe. Upon entering, the staff was very sweet and friendly. This is like home cooking. We ate here twice and all our food choices were fresh, delicious and like we would fix at home. Yum.",
    "After 3 weeks of working in the area I finally found a place off of Magazine that is not overrated. Friendly staff! Y'all know I love Phò so it's pretty damn good!",
    "Our family returned for breakfast again this weekend and the food and service was again impeccable ... Highly recommend",
    "The kayaking tour at the Santa Cruz Island was great.  My husband and I had a wonderful time.  Jen, our tour guide, was helpful and informative.  We had a lot of fun exploring the caves.  We didn't expect much but this tour definitely exceeded our expectation.",
    "Definitely recommend for anyone looking for a delicious meal at a reasonable price. The shrimp and goat cheese crepes are a must have!",
    "After living in the STL area for way over 10 years now, I am both ashamed and remorseful to admit that I ate here for the FIRST time just a few weeks ago. I am ashamed because it's a St. Louis tradition and remorseful because I missed out on it for so..many...years!   This place is amazing. What is not to love! It's a factory where you can get a tour (Friday-Sunday, noon-5pm on the hour), there's a shop, bar, and dining area. They also host many event with live music on the weekends. It's fun to just kind of wander and look around - don't worry, you'll get a chance because there will likely be a wait before you dine. The beer is, of course, amazing. The Hefeweizen is my personal favorite and a great start for anyone who is not a huge beer drinker (like myself). Additionally, the food is homegrown and damn good. I had the pizza (recommendation from my server) and it was really spectacular, though I'm admittedly a pizza connoisseur so I enjoy a good pizza pie more than most probably ;P My date had a bison burger which was also really good.   More fun info: the service is great! I think they tend to hire more funky and alternative people (like tattoo parlor staff) which I support. The quality is what makes this place stand out along with the emphasis on local food and brewery.   It is a little on the pricier side but for all the experience you get and the quality, it is worth it. I will go again and again and you probably should, too!",
    "If I could give it a zero, I would. I order a plain hamburger, and realized they put  bacon in it (which I am allergic to and unable to eat) after two bites. When I went back to the drive-through window to complain (didn't realize the actual restaurant was open--it was almost 2 after all...), the guy took back the burger, said nothing, and disappeared. After 2 minutes of awkwardly making conversation with the next people in line in their car, he came back and rudely told me I had to go inside to get my food. Which I did. And still did not get an apology.  I refuse to go back there after that ordeal, which is a shame, because it's nice to have a variety of places to go to after DT. Guess Freebirds it is!",
    "First time here and they did a great job, very satisfied with the car wash  and the service I received. Thank you",
    "I just started going to Sushi Nara this month (they opened just a short time ago).  I love this place; it is clean, the staff are friendly and acommodating, and the service is fast.  The sushi is always delicious ((I've been here 3 times) and the prices are reasonable. In fact, this week my husband stopped in for take out, bought 4 sushi rolls and the total was $24.  That is amazing.    I love the freshness of the food and there's a huge selection to choose from.  Everyone on the eastside, check this place out!",
    "Awesome little shop.  The owner really knows his stuff and you can tell he loves his work.  They have tires and other parts you won't find anywhere else.",
    "Been here so many times before and all I can say is the food is really good. A hidden gem in Florissant, it has the best Panang curry around. Haven't been to their sister restaurant yet, but I can't seem to want to move on when I am always so satisfied with their fare here.",
    "My food only merited maybe two stars but I will give an extra star because I like the menu (and will try more of it) and their design and concept.  Sadly though, my tomato-basil soup tasted kind of like a weak marinara and my tuna melt type sandwich had a very sharp, off-putting flavor.  It was citrusy, for sure, and I love lemon in a tuna melt but perhaps this was lemon zest or something just way too overpowering?  I think next time I will focus on the dishes with cured Italian meats, mortadella and prosciutto.  And also the baked goods, those sounded pretty good, especially the Nutella bruschetta!",
    "We visited once and were very disappointed in my veggie pizza and my husband's sub sandwich.  The tomato sauce was not tasty, and they did not use enough cheese on my pizza.  The dough looked and tasted like it was prepared by a machine.  Perhaps they have improved, but we are not in any rush to try a second time.",
    "A couple friends and I stopped by for some late night milkshakes and found ourselves at More Than Just Ice Cream. Well, we just got ice cream...not fully taking advantage of what the name implies, but maybe next time.  3 milkshakes: 1 coffee, 1 chocolate, and 1 black&white malt.   All were pretty good. Definitely satisfied the ice cream craving. I thought my coffee milkshake could have been thicker, same goes for the chocolate. The black&white was plenty thick and was probably the best of the three. Unfortunately, I did not order that one so I settled for my not so creamy coffee.  I did sample some ice cream flavors before setting on a milkshake. I tried the pumpkin pie which was AMAZING. I don't know why I didn't just get this. Maybe a milkshake isn't the way to go here.",
    "My husband and I took my mother here for her 100th birthday! We can't say enough about the treatment we received: from a great table and view, to delicious \"compliments of the chef\" extra dishes, to a beautifully decorated cake plate, to the warm and attentive servers. It was much more than we expected, even for this very special occasion. For us, it was a wonderfully memorable experience.",
    "Man. This place is nice. The bartender was awesome. Try the burger. It's fresh with all local ingredients. The plates of food I saw come out looked amazing as well.   The beer is cold. The drinks are mixed perfectly.  This is not a chain restaurant but a dedicated local place with good employees.",
    "I visited this restaurant 4 times during my 5 days stay. Crazy, right? Here are a list of reasons/pros:  - We were staying a nearby hotel. - The restaurant opens 11 - 10:30 pretty much every day including new year's day so it fits into our schedule. - If you are a party of two, chances are you get seated right away. - $9 per dozen of oysters which is a really great deal by any standard! - They have a seafood shop next door that sells boiled and fresh seafood to- go. - Our server (same) is very friendly and recognized us every single time.  Now I want to talk about the reasons why I only give it 3 stars.  - We tried a bunch of stuff which are all pretty mediocre. Raw oysters are not cleaned well. So if your schedule is flexible, go to Superior Seafood during their happy hours for their 50 cents/oyster - better quality and cheaper. Turtle soup has a strange taste so I definitely prefer Felix's. A portion of my boiled shrimps are always mushy somhow, maybe boiled for too long?... - The ambient is inviting but not comfortable so we basically just finished our food and go.  - Clean the bathroom!!  Will probably visit again if we stay in the area next time or simply just pick up some seafood quickly.",
    "Skip this train wreck if you are looking for dinner.  Our server was clueless...like we seriously thought she was lost in the restaurant.  Had to ask for setups, water refills, etc.  Ordered chicken parmesan and got eggplant parmesan instead with a fish bone in it.  The drinks were good.",
    "Meh is all I can say for TDS. The restaurant itself is just cold.... not literally, but figuratively. There was no decor, no menu boards, stainless steel prep tables as dining tables, no soda machines, staff EVERYWHERE with no identification (shirts, nametags, etc). The food is reasonably priced and most of it was quite good, but what really irked my party was the fact that they charge for extra salsa!!! We ordered a salsa trio (which included 3 samples of the various salsas, in 2oz glass prep bowls), and when my brother asked for more salsa for his tacos (mind you, we ordered one of ever taco, three burritos and guacamole), he was told he'd have to buy the trio again! Really!!??? We spent over $40 on food, drinks and apps, too. Even though the food was decent, I wouldn't return as the atmosphere is just blah and you can't get extra salsa for your damn tacos!",
    "I'm so incredibly happy with our pictures! Angela Clifton Photography have worked with us 3 times and we have been happy with every single picture that was taken! Not only are the photos fabulous, but we had such a fun experience. The price is extremely reasonable and the pictures will be a keepsake we will cherish forever!",
    "Enjoyed my fish out at a sidewalk table.  A bit pricey but food was good.  Go to Side street in French quarter if u want quieter dining outside.",
    "The court house is very old and the art is great. The spiral staircase is funny. One can get view of entire city from 5th level. The tower clock room is really surprising with all mechanical gears inside!! You need a prior appointment to get into clock room. Worth spending 2 to 3 hours of time here.",
    "I had the pleasure to meet with Ann today and not only was she extremely helpful and so positive, she went above and beyond to make my 1st experience here amazing and made it a absolute regular customer from this day forward. Thanks girlie!!",
    "This is the first time I tried this place and  I was surprisingly surprised. I had a combination dinner pad Thai and coconut soup. The soup was very tasty as I never had coconut soup before. The pad Thai was exactly what I was expecting and it did not disappoint. The restaurant had great Thai decor and music. The staff and service was top notch. For a town with not much selection for food, this was a great change of pace. This may become my go to place in Carp.",
    "This place was so chill and relaxing. When I come back it'll definitely be in my list if stops. Not to mention the artist performing was fun and eclectic  (I mean really, a country version of \"Let It Go\", what's not to love?)",
    "Id you haven't been to the Smoothie King center since it was know as the New Orleans Arena, you are in for a nice surprise. The arena has had a face lift and, while the seats are the same,  everything else has been refreshed.     Most importantly,  the food options are far more varied and appeal to many tastes.  The quality of the food is very good and significantly improved from a few years back. The drink options are much improved as well and include full service bars, spiked lemonade,  bottled and draft beer and of course, smoothies.  There is even a spot for sweets. You can get funnel cake, cotton candy, and all kinds of delicious things I was too full to take in.    The venue finally feels a bit swanky and top notch.  We are moving on up!",
    "Don't know what it is but If my tummy's feeling icky, I can count on Chipotle's stake to fix me up. I just have to remember not to go during full on lunch time. I usually go between 2 & 4 when it's peaceful and calm. Busy or not the service is always friendly and fast!",
    "I must admit, I wasn't expecting much. This place totally blew us away. This has to be one of the best Indian restaurants in the Tampa Bay. The ambience is wonderful including white table linens. The best part was the food, OMG. The chicken 65 was to die for, and the hot sour soup was rich and flavorful. The waitress (Angel) was friendly,  attentive and very pleasant. They opened just a week ago. I'm sure this will soon be the place foodies seek out for real Indian food.",
    "Had to wait until my third trip to NOLA to actually get in the door.  First two times I tried waiting in line, this time around we got smart and bought reserved seats so we could be on the benches. Well worth the extra $20 to not hassle with waiting in line for an hour. It goes toward the preservation of Jazz so it's a good cause...just splurge.  The show was fantastic.  True musicians and great personalities to boot. I can only imagine that this is what concerts were like 50 years ago. The band members were dapper, engaging and insanely talented.  It's in a tiny hole in the wall space that only holds maybe 200 people? So it's very intimate and nice to see the smiles on the faces of the musicians as they share their craft with you. This is a must do while in NOLA!",
    "A GREAT EXPERIENCE!!!!!!!!!  I was a completely new customer.  I did not have an appointment because my other plans got rained out and my dealership was too busy to take me.  I needed a PA State & Emissions  inspection which I dread because they can be a total ripoff at some places when they add things on and I just wanted to get it over with.  I saw that this place had much better reviews on Yelp than many other shops in the area.  Keystone Discount Tire took my 2008 Pontiac Torrent in for inspection while I waited and had some free coffee.  I only had to get up once to look at some irregular outer front tire wear on my car when it was on the rack during inspection.  I always appreciate it when the technician lets me look at the problem.   It was nothing major.  Easily correctable with an alignment sometime in the future.  Bill was very friendly, knowledgable, and straightforward with his overall analysis of my car.  My car was fully inspected and stickered in less than an hour without my bill being jacked up with add-ons.   I recommend getting on their mailing list for their coupons!!!!!!!!!!",
    "Wow! I never thought my sons phone could be repaired after he dropped it but it is and it took less than a half an hour! Very professional and excellent service! I'm thrilled!",
    "Service and management terrible... After messing up all 4 of our orders the waiter got mad and started cursing... The manager offered our drinks to be free.. What a mess. The food was cold and nasty didn't even eat half of it and waited over an hour... I will never dine in any cracker barrel again after this experience...",
    "I have been to a number of dog friendly hotels...just not in the city and did not know what to expect. Usually they are motel like.  This one was in the heart of the city.  I walked tentatively into the hotel lobby as i have a labrador/golden mix who is not easy to hide.  We got to the front desk to register and i was still feeling uneasy although my  bf had assured me it was a dog friendly hotel. Reception was so nice immediately putting us at ease. As we checked in an attendant asked if Bentley could have treats which she fullly enjoyed. The Reception person also asked if we would like a welcome kit for Bentley. Holy moly. Of course. Dog dishes, a mat, treats, etc. I was blown away.    Plus the guests at the hotel all stopped to compliment and pet \"queen Bentley\". Our room was on the top floor. Awesome!  Even when i went to walk her the car attendants greeted her by name. We were so impressed with the service we decided to come back an extra night.   Thank you Loews. I didnt realize a hotel could be so dog friendly especially to a big dog.",
    "Sometimes this food is very very good.  Unfortunately it's not consistent.   Ordered something I've been getting for years and every other time it tastes incredible. It's like they have different people in the kitchen and you don't know who you will get. So 50 % of the time it's excellent.  UGH.",
    "Been to this location twice and will never go back again!!!!  First time was mediocre, the second time was so very disappointing it beggars belief. I ordered some ribs and had to send them back because one half was warm and the other half was refrigerator cold. They came back and one side was really hot and the other side was still cold, third time it was edible. The manager came over the third time to apologize, never once offered to comp anything. I'm not the kind of guy to cause a fuss to get something comped, but to send something back three times to get it cooked properly and only get an insincere apology really pisses me off, enough for me to write this review.",
    "After trying a few ramen places with crazy variety in their selections and stellar broth, I was not too excited about the ramen I got at Cheu.  Maybe it's a matter of taste, but personally, I was not a fan of their thick noodles, and extremely salty broth.    The service was great, and they had a nice selection of beers!  The friend I went with loved it, and has been many times.  Honestly, I'm just sorry I wasn't a bigger fan.  But I hope others try it for themselves.  I might just be an oddball out on this one.",
    "Federal Doughnuts is a new concession at the ballpark -- who doesn't love some doughnuts and fried chicken?    Also, there is now a concession stand near 136 that is gluten-free dedicated.  They offer pizza, cheesesteaks and even brownies and cookies.",
    "Looks like there is a second Red Kings restaurant in Chinatown and it did not disappoint! Since this place just opened yesterday, I'm not exactly sure if it's replacing the other Red Kings down the street, or if it is just a second helping of spicy, Szechuan food.  We ordered takeout and picked up the Dan Dan Noodles and a shredded Pork in Garlic sauce dish. The spice level in both dishes was perfect.  Extremely mouth-burning, but with delicious flavors that were sweet, earthy, and fresh. The portions were very generous and will make for great leftovers for us. I can't wait to try some of the other dishes and come back here for a sit-down dinner. They also have karaoke rooms upstairs, plus they are BYOB.",
    "This is one of the busiest Chick fil A's I've seen but they always manage to be quick and have exceptional service! I seriously don't know how they can be so quick and great all the time! One of my favorite places!",
    "Best place for salads! I go there every time I'm in town for lunch. It's fast and veggies are always fresh.",
    "My parents and I took the Oak Alley and Laura Plantation tour on September 26th, 2015.  I forgot the name of our driver-he was very informative on our drive to the plantations.  The schedule is perfect!  We were dropped off where we had time before and after the tour for free time to walk around the properties.  They are very flexible with drop off locations on the return drive.  We got off near Jackson Square and got to enjoy the rest of the afternoon in the French Quarter.",
    "We have been here twice for brunch and have enjoyed it immensely. Everything we have tried has been delicious, particularly the grits with scallions and sour cream. But the room is always freezing so be sure to bring a sweater!",
    "Love this place...best hot dogs and chili dogs around...i go here as many times as i can..yum",
    "Sweet spot in the Waterline. Came for some live music with friends on Saturday. Very cool. Best local beer in town by far. Seems like the concept is a few notches up from Fig Mountain. Definitely prefer Topa. Even cooler is that you can order incredible food from the Nook Restaurant, and walk two feet into Lama Dog which is part of the Waterline. I love it!!",
    "Great customer service! We were a little out of their pick up area but they were very accommodating and came and got our group of 7. When we got there we realized we were billed for 8 instead of 7. I called and he refunded my money for the extra ticket in minutes!  The tour itself was SO much fun! We were laughing and smiling and our tour guide was funny! We saw lots of alligators! From babies swimming in the water to full grown ones! We saw turtles and birds too! Our tour guide had a baby alligator we could hold that he's raising until it's a little bigger since it was a late hatch that would have died because of when it was born. The ride back was fun too because we went fast and the guide did some \"tricks\" with the boat! I highly recommend this tour!!!",
    "Westfall replaced our roof in April. We could not be more pleased with the entire process. Quality roof, excellent communication and excellent follow up. Very happy we chose this company to replace our roof.",
    "Good food, reasonably priced, and nice staff. Not ideal for eating in, but since they are going for a fast food approach to vegan food, that makes a lot of sense. I know the buffalo bella is the dish that they push the hardest, but for my money the Cheesesteak is the way to go. And pro-tip: Get the sweet potato fries.",
    "The ramen is okay, nothing spectacular. Service is okay. Good place for a quick stop but wouldn't go if there were other choices. Been here twice, will continue to go.",
    "A menu that satisfies everyone's cravings! Clean, trendy, and delicious! I definitely recommend going early (before 9 am) as the wait tends to get longer after 9 am! But honestly, it is soooo worth the wait. You will leave there feeling so incredible satisfied!",
    "Had the brisket sandwich with two sides and a drink for 9.99 - Great barbecue at an affordable price. Wonderful side such as potato casserole cream spinach baked beans green beans",
    "The food and service was amazing! I only wish they had any vegetarian/vegan options. Can't wait to come back!",
    "Great food. Terrible customer service. I've been three times and I've had two different older waitresses. Not pleasant to deal with whatsoever. The owner on the other hand is lovely.",
    "I first heard about this place on the plane ride over from a Franklin local.  He recommended that we brave the line and try one of Nashvilles best breakfast spots.  HE WAS RIGHT.  Holly cow this place kicked butt and we didn't even have to wait in line!! We were lucky to miss the rush said our waitress.   I had this super savory corn pancake with bacon, salsa, and sour cream. So good. This place will always be a stop when I get back to the south~~~",
    "OMG!!! I can't believe this kind of service exists!  My husband called to make an appointment for full detailing for next Sat with Michael, he called again to confirm on Fri before we head there since it's a distance from our home.  Michael said he didn't know we wanted to do full detailing thou we specifically mentioned that.  He advised us to come the following sat instead.  We agreed and we reached there at 8am on the following week.  Guess what?  Nobody is at the workshop, it's closed!  We called him and he said he is busy and will call back.. We waited for half an hour in our car and there is still no call from him.  We headed for our breakfast and came back again at 9:30am hoping to give him another chance.  Here comes Alex, his partner opening the shop at 9:30am!  1.5 hours away from our appt time and still no sight of Michael.  Alex tried calling Michael and couldn't get hold of him.  We gave up!!! What a horrendous experience!",
    "I had numerous things happen during my move and required additional services from this office. The guys in this office are top notch and are very trustworthy. I'd say more about how they took great care of me, but they may have gone above and beyond what they should have and afraid to say too much. I would recommend this office to my mother!",
    "We stayed at The Saint last year for a girl's trip. The lobby is lovely, they have a cool bar and restaurant that you can't help but to \"ohh and ahh\" over when you walk in.  All the things I'm accustomed too when I stay at a hotel anywhere...ambiance, a little sexy but not overkill! Everyone is so friendly, etc.  I'm thinking \"oh shhhh this is going to be a great weekend!\"  I checked in a few hours before my girl arrived because I had a ton of work i needed to do. So I set up my laptop ordered some room service and worked for about 4 hours straight. Left out to buy a bottle and get a mani/pedi.  My girl arrives...its about to be some trouble in NOLA... the two of us and no supervision...we pop out for dinner, come back in giggling as usual and we see it...a HUGH flying roach.  I'm freaked out.  I literally walk right out of the room down to the front desk.  I CANNOT!!!! They tell me they're sending a maintenance worker to handle it.  NOT GOOD ENOUGH! If there's one that's bold enough to show itself, he has other cohorts that prefer to live behind the scenes. They give us another room but tell me they can't do more until 8am.  No the room the move us too also has small spiders and other dead small bugs in the corners of the window. The TV doesn't work and one of the lamps doesn't have bulbs in it! COME ON!  At this point its about 3am and I know I'm not staying here past 8:15am. I dont want to sit my purse let alone my luggage in this hotel! I go online to my normal go to hotel, The W and book us there for the rest of the trip! 8am comes and goes no manager comes to our room. I go down and demand to see someone immediately.  This younger gentlemen comes out and apologizes.  I thank him for his apology and politely request ALL of my money back immediately.   He obliged and asked if  I would consider coming back after changes have been made! Bless his heart. NO dear!",
    "Say you decide that you need a new door...and you only have $35.  Where do you go?  the Green Project.   Or you have a bunch of left over building supplies, random bits of lumber, some roofing materials, maybe even some paint?  Where can you bring it so it doesn't end up in a landfill?  Again, the Green Project.",
    "Worst place I've ever visited. The bouncer was rude and he didn't have to be. This place thinks just cause your on broadway you can treat people bad and over charge.   I'm not a tourist I live here and will never visit or recommend",
    "Stopped in for the lunch menu with my girlfriend, place was extremely clean, food was ON POINT!  And AFFORDABLE Can't wait to go back!!",
    "So disappointing on so many levels. Have been coming here for years - and the quality of food has fallen off a cliff. Strike one - we shared an artichoke to start - and clearly it had been prepared beforehand (eg, cold on the inside - but the flesh was cooked through)  Strike two - my wife had a Greek salad - and it clearly all came from a bag and was extremely overdressed with tasteless dressing.  Strike three - I had grilled yellowtail which was basically execrable - could not even finish it (overcooked and an inferior-frozen piece of fish - unacceptable for SB).   In short - great setting, good service - but with such horrible food - not worth the visit. This place really needs to up the quality of food - or it's going to end up just another lower State dive for the tourists.",
    "Milktooth is the place to go if you want a good breakfast cocktail and a twist on traditional brunch. At first glance of the menu, you may think you've never heard of any of these foods for breakfast, and you may be right. I guarantee no matter what you order, you're going to enjoy it.   Milktooth is one of the most popular brunch places in Indy, which means you will typically have a wait. Trust me, it's worth the usual 30 minute wait (on weekends). To make it go by a little faster, they've got a walk up bar for their coffee drinks and pastries. Snack on one of those to give you a preview of the amazing meal you're about to have.  Their menu changes from time to time but they have a few things that stay one the menu but change ingredients. I love all of their variations on a Dutch pancake, and their raclette grilled cheese is to die for.  If you're making this a boozy breakfast, don't pass up on the michelada. And sit outside if it's warm enough!",
    "The bar and staff are AMAZING. we got a room upgrade for have been being on our honeymoon and the view was gorgeous. But, the room was not any better than a hilton. It had rust in the tub floor, and some weird stains on the tile. But this was only in the bathroom, so i give it 4 stars! Great staff, but too much for valet so we parked a couple streets down. That was the only other con I would say.   Would recommend if you want to be literally in the working downtown area of st. louis. Lots of cool bars and restaurants on a friday night.",
    "I took the beginning class there, and I loved it. It was perfectly paced, and though the moves weren't difficult, they really stretched me in places I didn't know existed! I even broke a small sweat! But I felt great afterwards! The studio is clean, and I like that I can buy some Beyond Organic food items there too.",
    "Not sure why it took until now for us to find this place. We started out going to the chain lobster restaurant but wanted something more authentic. A friend recommended Lobster Haven and I checked it out online. Looked like a type of place we would eat at in Massachusetts when we visit family. We were not disappointed! Service was great, fast and very friendly. Huge selection of all of the favorites. You have to visit this place if you want authentic New England seafood. You can also purchase live lobster and fresh seafood to go and cook it yourself.",
    "Fabulous! Best happy hour, fresh menu, Delish- drinks, if I had the time, I'd come here every day!",
    "Men's clubs is the tits, plain and simple. All the barbers got skills enough to hook it up fresh. Been coming here for 3 years and I've never had any problems. Except for maybe that one time when this dude tried to steal my cut. Tim kept it real though and said \"I can't give you the same cut as Ryan.\" Thanks Tim.",
    "My husband and I come here often. We love the food here, it's always fresh and the service is great. We highly recommend this place to anyone who loves sushi & hibachi.",
    "Oh Chickie's and Pete's, you are the perfect place to watch some sports and indulge.   No doubt this is not the best food I've ever had but, if you can get a seat, grab some beer with mussels red and crab fries, there's no way not to thoroughly enjoy this place during a game or any time you're down by the stadiums.   My favs are the crab fries, mussels red (white is overloaded with garlic that I can't always take it), the spicy pull and peel shrimp, steamers, and if the mood is right the blue crabs (it's a lot of work but tasty). This place also makes getting down and dirty with your food easy. There are sinks all over so you can rinse the mess off your hands once you're done....good touch.  To sum it up, Chickie's and Pete's is a Philadelphia institution and always a good time. I strongly suggest going at least once to enjoy the experience.   Please note: Make sure to remember two things before coming during major sporting events. 1. You'll never get a table and 2. You'll deal with a ton of drunk people. I've absolutely been one of these people before and we can get annoying unless you're in the right frame of mind. :)",
    "Prompt and professional. On a Saturday. Simple mirror fix, but they made it easy for me. I have used them in Charlotte and they were great then, too.",
    "Good choice in Union Station St. Louis.  I had the Ponchartrain (server said it is same as Tilapia, though that was also on the menu, so why two names for the same fish, I have no clue).  The Ponchartrain was quite good with mushrooms and a cream sauce.  We also had the shrimp cocktail and lump crab cake appetizers....both fine, but not wonderful.  Drinks and service were perfectly acceptable.  We dined outside on the patio since the weather was nice - inside looks comfy and a bit less casual.",
    "I stopped in for a drink yesterday and have to say the atmosphere gets an A+ from me.  Such a unique concept for the St. Pete area.  The attention to detail with the remodel was outstanding, it almost feels like you are in a Harry Potter movie or something.  There is background music that is set at a low volume so you can clearly hear your friends or not have to shout for them to hear you - perfect for the old library-esque environment. Working behind the bar were Michael and Peggy - both couldn't have been more friendly and were overall just interesting people to talk to.   I had eaten dinner already before I came so can't speak on the food but will definitely be back to try - the prices for meat/cheese trays are much better than comparable places in the area.  I would definitely recommend checking this place out...",
    "Yes! I love this place! Maple Street Patisserie is the bomb.com! I've never been disappointed. Best blueberry muffin I've ever had in my whole entire life. Delicious breakfast and lunch spot. They also do specialty cakes so swing by during Mardi Gras and grab a king cake. Also the owner, Ziggy, is the man. He's always running around working crazy hours to make all these scrumptious baked goods. Can't beat this place :)",
    "Really good burger. I had the Bourbon Black and Bleu. It was cooked like I wanted and very tasty.   I gave them 3 stars for the wait. We had a big party - 4 adults and 5 kids - and it took over an hour to get our food. Shouldn't have taken that long, regardless of how many people were at our table.",
    "It seems to me that whenever we have out of towner guests, our go to place is consistently Katie's. The variety of food wonderfully prepared is 2nd to none. Reasonably priced and delicious, Katie's never disappoints. Whether you choose the grilled ersters, the shrimp and grits, the Cuban sandwich, pizza, or soup & salad you will be very pleased and have a great meal. Daily specials hi-lite local seasonal offerings that keep things fresh. The service staff are warm and friendly. On Sunday's, you will want to time your arrival before church let's out or you will have a bit of a wait. That said, you can always manage while enjoying bottomless Mimosas!",
    "Came in after attending the Zurich Classic golf tournament. It was a warm and a bit humid so what tastier then a ice cream cone? I lucked out and found a parking space on the street. The interior is quite cute and comfy.  The selection here is crazy huge but after sampling a couple of unusual flavors I went with the scoop of cookie monster ice cream on a cone. The ice cream hit the spot and I enjoyed it BC it wasn't overly sweet.  Creole Creamery was definitely worth checking out!",
    "I LOVE this place!  I have been coming here for a few years now.  Its a little funky, and I would never order say the escargot, for safety reasons, but when it comes to lots of Saki, great rolls, and mountains of rice and Sashimi, this is the way to go.  Young atmosphere, loud dance music, and SAKI!",
    "We absolutely love everything we have tried here. Our favorite thus far has been the Backyard Bowl, although there are several more that we still need to try. My husband and I are always full after we each get a kids size, or split a large. The ingredients are good quality,  filling foods. For the quality of ingredients, the price is very reasonable. It can get pretty busy here, but have patience, it is worth the wait.",
    "It's was okay service was a bit on the interesting side as the person was new. Food presentation was good though they need to either add rice or more potato salad to the gumbo. Sprite was flat but I didn't need it anyways.",
    "This is a pretty good pancake place, but it's a little disorganized in the way it's run when it's really busy. The pancakes are pretty good but super sweet, so you have to be in there. Good price point. Serves breakfast all day so that's definitely a plus, but not anything particularly special that you couldn't get anywhere else.",
    "Great finds and wonderful staff!  LOVE our finds and will definitely be back!!!",
    "We've been coming here since I was a kid. The staff has watched me and now my kids grow up. They're personable and so nice. They're also very prompt with service. Yoli and frank are the absolute best! The food is amazing! I absolutely love their shredded beef burro and cheese crisp. I feel they have true authentic Mexican food.",
    "Dine-in gets 2 stars. Disappointing service & venue falls short.   The food was ok; so if you were to do take out, maybe this place would get 3 stars.   I ordered the lamb kebab, which tasted ok; but it was very plain. No sauces, lettuce or anything - just meat.",
    "The best middle eastern restaurant in this area!! Food is great and consistent!! Makes my tummy happy!!!",
    "I cannot even believe someone gave this place one star. Here's the scoop. They have the BEST cannoli in the city. Termini's are no where NEAR as good, and Isgro's is far too hyped up for the quality. Potito's is my go to for cannoli, i wouldn't even THINK about going anywhere else. I'm there every xmas eve, and will be for the rest of my days. I stood in line for isgros for TWO HOURS this year for a tirimisu, i walked right into potito's and picked up my bambino cannoli stuffed cannoli. it's as good as it sounds, trust me.",
    "Truly, I cannot say enough good things about this tiny, authentic, perfectly delicious eatery!  Growing up in the panhandle of Texas, we had plenty of authentic Mexican food in our home, and I'm always searching for good Mexican restaurants. El Limon is the best I've ever had in the state of Pennsylvania!  Sopes, tostadas, enchiladas, fajitas, burritos, fish tacos....all excellent and sooooo reasonable!  Waitstaff is always pleasant and attentive.  Best two features: homemade tamales and free margaritas!!  Bring the entire family for an amazing Mexican feast!  Ole!",
    "I'm giving this joint 4 stars because they have earned it, but they are definitely 5 star material, if they work out a few kinks. Granted, they just opened, so some of the errors I've experienced (I work in the area, so I've been there several times) will probably get worked out and they are more than willing to make corrections and accommodations when they mess up.   But over all, the food is REALLY good. Unlike my fellow Yelp-ers, I would say that ther pizza is not their strong suit - its kinds greasy and not sure if they use 100% mozzarella - tastes like its cut with something cheaper. However, so far I've had:    The Quaker (Chicken version) - Delicious. They make their chicken steaks with the chunky chicken, which I like much more than the shredded version. They could season the chicken more, but the cheese was melted perfectly and the veggies were fresh.   The fries - crisp and flavorful. I didn't even need ketchup, and I always eat ketchup on my fries  The onion rings - a little greasy, but very tasty and crisp. The onions stayed in the breading and didn't slide out when you bit them (which I hate).   Spanakopita - mine was a little over cooked, but the flavors were really good  Baklava - VERY GOOD!   Signature Salad - The veggies they use are very fresh which will make or break a salad. Their balsamic is great too!  The (turkey) Greek Burger - one of the best turkey burgers I've ever had! The patty was moist and flavorful all on its own, but then they top it with what must be homemade tzatziki. I could eat a bowl of that stuff! My burger had romaine instead of the advertised arugula, but it was very fresh, so I didn't mind as much. I also asked for feta, which I didn't get, but that sauce made me forget all about it.   Overall, this place is great! Provided they don't stray from the high quality standard they are setting, I will keep going back.",
    "Planet fitness gets four stars just because it is open 24 hours. If you are looking at cheapest it's cheapest best bang for your buck . Not much motivation since bodybuilders don't go there much mostly big women . No pun intended . No discrimination I myself used to be big, although I changed that .  Tanning bed and massage chairs and a sculpt machine and everything. Else for 20.00 a month . 9.99 - the massage and stuff and can't bring friends . All the employees are polite and helpful .",
    "Very disappointed. We went to eat  at 2:15 on Saturday and were told the kitchen closed at 2. Their website says: Sat & Sun all day. Their website claims that they are open until 5. I'm always a bit suspect of places that can't manage simple details like their hours on their website. It makes me wonder about the awareness to quality and other \"small\" items.",
    "These guys do good work, on time, and warranty their work.  I would highly recommend them!",
    "Eat here at least 2 times a week. Servers are always friendly and the food is amazing. I never leave disappointed & always leave with a full stomach",
    "A truly delightful find! This is the transformed Carrow's Restaurant on Plumb and Kietzke that was saved by the wrecking ball by its beautiful redwood beams and fascia. The food was fantastic. My wife had the tri-tip salad -- greens on one side of the plate with a balsamic vinagrette balanced by four good-sized slices of medium-rare tri-tip and potato \"croutons\" -- little heavenly bits of crunchy potatoes. I had the tri/tip/chicken combo, selecting the fresh corn salad and potato salad as my two sides. It was so good that we ordered dessert as well (not something I do regularly). The offering was lemon meringue, mudd pie, apple pie, and ice cream. We shared the first -- again delicious, with real, perfectly set and browned meringue. The prices were very reasonable for the quality of food and the experience. We've already recommended to family and friends locally, and expect to return soon. Well done!",
    "Rebecca didn't Doula my birth.  BUT, she was our nanny to our first born daughter.  Over the months of her being in my home, I realized that I looked forward to talking to her before & after work.  I was big & pregnant with Baby #2, and her information & suggestions hit home with this expectant Momma!  She was always easy to talk with, yet honest and extremely truthful!  (A trait I LOVE!!!).  She loves the special role she plays as Doula to laboring woman!!  She finds beauty and strength in that magical time. Bec would be a great addition to your support team!!!",
    "Recently had my car tinted by Orange Tint and Tune and had fantastic service.  They offer a car pick up service if you live within 4 miles of their shop which is extremely convenient.  Carlos was my technician and went over all the tint options with me and even adjusted the grade of the tint after I expressed the look that I was trying to achieve.  That's the kind of customer care that deserves 5 stars.  In addition, the receptionist was very pleasant and the owner Dustin even followed up to see how my service was.",
    "Stayed here three nights on business.  The property is located very close to the airport but you really don't hear it.  The rooms are standard TownePlace Suite rooms with a refrigerator, stove, etc..  The area in which the hotel is located is quiet with a combination of other hotels and office buildings.  It's about a 20 minute drive to the downtown or university area.  About 5-10 minutes from Pima Air Museum.  There are not too many restaurants close by but there are some fast food options and a sandwich place called Baggins that was really good and within walking distance.  The staff of the hotel was really friendly and helpful.  The breakfast is standard continental with a couple of hot options. They also have a reception on weekday evenings.  My only complaint is that the food and drink go quickly so get there early.  You could use this as a dinner if you wanted.  I got there about 45 minutes after it started and although there was food left there were very few soft drinks left (no diet).  They could improve by keeping the area stocked throughout the period.  Anyway, the rooms are nice, beds are comfortable and area is safe.",
    "We got diverted to Tampa and decided to make the drive to Orlando but first we needed somewhere to eat. Wanting to avoid chain restaurants, yelp steered us towards this little local gem!  The ladies had the 7 oz. Tampa strip and the gents both had a 14 oz. ribeye. They grill their steaks over oak and citrus Wood and the smoky flavor is to die for! We are big fans of our smoker back home and cook our steaks this way as well, it's rare to find steak cooked over woodsmoke in most places and this was worth the side trip!  Sides were veggies and sweet potatoes. The wines on offer were so reasonably priced- most under $20 a bottle but a decent selection. They just don't mark them up 5x like most places!   Our waitress Lisa also made great recommendations and her service was welcoming, friendly, and excellent. We are so glad we went local instead of to a chain. Bookmarking this place for a return trip next time I am in Tampa for sure!",
    "The owner of this location (and two others including Southampton) reached out to me after my previous review. We ended up talking for half an hour and I was very impressed with his approach to business... he's definitely the type of person I want to do business with. I returned to Saladworks on two separate occasions and the service had vastly improved. The new summer salads are wonderful!",
    "By far the best deli I have ever been to in the US. YEP, the US. Lots of crazy choices and oh it is hard to pick!! The Muffalata is so big 4 people can share. It is so tasty and amazing! Go on Saturday or Thursday night when they have live music! The special is always a good pick and don't worry there are plenty of sides to choose from. Great Chili, potato salad and of course chips. GO NOW...",
    "My dad and I are on a cross country trip and one of our first stops was Saguaro National Park.  We did a quick tour with Park Ranger Carolyn and loved it. She was incredibly enthusiastic and passionate about her studies on the saguaro and she was very knowledgeable. Definitely recommend both the tour and Carolyn.",
    "Came here after my husband bought home their lemon pepper wings. They have plenty of flavors. Ranging from ones you've heard of (lemon pepper, mild) to New Orleans flavors (yaka mein, noonie bird). They also have their drinks. The watermelon is to die for. I don't know what they put in it but lord help them. The location isn't the best but they're trying to put something back in the community. It's in the same section with the daiquiri shop so it's really not that bad during the day. I probably wouldn't come at night by myself. Definitely give this place a try. Hey you might even see Skip.",
    "Back to Tom Jones and time to update my review. I didn't see that odd ATM type machine that only lets you withdraw money to apply to your check. It's no longer there-used to be next to restrooms. There is still a payphone back there which I love. There are now ATM's at front entrance.   The blue ribbon is now $3.79, but still a bargain since it includes everything: pancakes, 2 eggs, toast, sausage, bacon,juice & coffee. I ate here with my kids. My daughter's choice. Says she \"loves Tom Jones\". Our meals included blue ribbons, french toast, chicken, club sandwich & baked potato . Everyone gets what they like.     I don't smell stale smoke and would not call it dirty.  I like the \"loud\" orange booths. I feel like I went back in time with these and the payphone. Service is always fast and I always seem to get a different waitress. Don't know where they find these young ladies but they're good. I've seen different managers there and they are all quick and on top of things-which makes a good manager.    Since it's my daughter's fave I'm bumping it up from 4 to 5 stars.",
    "I am an amateur athlete. I first met Dr. Ferrel when I was playing softball. He was watching my game when I was severely injured.  He treated me on the field by relocating my ankle and then told me to come to his office for treatment. I told him I could not afford that as a single mom on a teacher's salary. Instead, I saw a physician. He said it would be months before I would play again. Depressed and without much hope, I reached out to Dr. Ferrel again. He did treat me as he promised. Not only did he treat me, he healed me within weeks instead of months. Over the years Dr. Ferrel has worked on me with amazing results each time. He will always be my hero...",
    "Always fun to go to their shows.  Entertaining and relaxed atmosphere. For a good time and good food at a fair price this is the place to go.",
    "Love in n out. There's just a mood for in n out that you have to fulfill sometimes.  What can I say. 4 patties animal style bruh",
    "Cindy is the best! Great food and service. Food is authentic and so is the staff. Everything is made fresh and you can taste the difference from other Mexican restaurants at first bite. I would recommend to anyone that enjoys Mexican cuisine.",
    "I've been wanting to try Trust Me BBQ for over a year now.  I stopped in there about 3 months ago and waited in line for 10 minutes with no service and left.  After reading reviews, I figured I'd give it a chance again just to see what all the fuss is about.  The food was 50/50 but the service was horrible so I'll likely never return.  The gentleman behind the counter didn't speak, smile or engage with us at all, I felt like I was at a vending machine.  Once we finally ordered, he didn't even listen to the order and put the wrong sides in our meals, we had to correct him while he was serving.  All in all, I will just stick with Down to the Bone BBQ  Pros:  BBQ Sauce is delicious, macaroni salad was different and interesting, \"pulled\" pork was moist.  Cons:  Chicken was more dry than a sheet of paper, inedible even with the BBQ Sauce.  Mac & Cheese was served from a pan that has probably been on the steam table for 2-3 days.  Collard Greens were very mildly flavored.",
    "Was in town for a week and came by this little hole in the wall.  The pa nang chicken was excellent.  I ordered one star spicy and it came quick.  Will definitely return.",
    "Cinco de mayo means margaritas and sangria and all things fried... this great place does a nice job with combining flavors of several different ethnicities and backgrounds and develops recipes that are unique.  Although not touted as a \"Mexican\" destination they know how to rock the rock salt and pour that tequila.  They also just opened a wine bar a couple doors down for overflow and specialty bottles.  A high five for the on the rocks margaritas and house made white or red sangria - definitely worth the trip!",
    "This small little donut bakery is located in one of Hermitage's oldest shopping centers!   I can imagine baking donuts is a hard job, let alone running the business...it's one of those jobs that starts in the wee hours of the morning so that the donuts are freshly made daily!  Yeu, the owner, serves not only your common popular donuts, but he also serves donuts with bacon on top, apple fritters, pigs in a blanket, breakfast pastries, and  kolaches....in addition to these yummy treats...he makes doughssants....they are what seems to be a scandalous marriage of a donut and a croissant...!!!!!!!! Need I say more? Yeah...you heard me. A doughssant! Worth the trip just to eat one of these!   Prices are considerably cheap! The doughssants are only $1.99 each! The regular donuts are about $.60 each!   These sweet donuts are my favorite treats to buy for my kid's school teachers...and they love them!   Coffee also served here!",
    "We have had a blast to each event we've been to.  We've been to concerts and basketball games and other were a lot of fun.  The food is really good, also.  A lot of local favorites are offered.",
    "Excellent food. We tried three appetizers and five entries and all of them were a hit. This prices are reasonable and the service is good. I'd go back again and again.",
    "The service here has gone down. We used to go here a lot but now we go to another one. The service was slow and forgotten about.",
    "Hands down the worst chicken and rice plate I've ever had. When I ordered I was told there was no sauce on the chicken (as I wanted, healthy). I ordered to go, by the time I reached the car the bag was full of oil spilling out of the container. There was easily 5-7 tablespoons of oil on the dish. Not what I was told and not what anyone would ever want to eat. Horrible.   Their slogan even has the word healthy in it. What a joke.",
    "Great experience purchasing a washer and dryer.  I just bought a new home and needed all new appliances. Iam so glad I decided to go even though the reviews were not great which I don't understand since I had no issues whatsoever. There was an excellent selection, knowledgeable salespeople and timely delivery. The level of service we received was beyond expected! I really felt like they were working hard to give me the best price and offered many options to stay in my budget  They even took the time to check if there were any additional sales prices or discounts they could offer me. I was given honest feedback and all of my questions were answered. I am very happy with Sears and I would highly recommend!",
    "The food here is great. They're quick and the staff is so nice, seriously. I always feel welcome when I place my order here.",
    "I finally got to try them. Wow..they did a great job with the remodle. I loved the mushroom cheese steak",
    "The espresso here is excellent. My favorite place to come for an Americano. The staff is polite and friendly and vibes are mellow. It is important to know that there is no access to power outlets, but unlimited wifi access. The bathrooms and the rest of the establishment are always clean.",
    "Went here based on the high ratings and raves from people.  The entire experience was underwhelming from start to finish.  Their website which is fairly useless if you want to figure out the menu before going, you have to pick your location choice out of 3 locations and then drill down to the bottom to see the weak descriptions of their menu offering, no explanations and no price, just this      Roast Beef     Roast Beef Combo     Roast Pork     Roast Pork Combo     Baked Ham     Baked Ham Combo     Roast Turkey     Roast Turkey Combo     Broccoli Rabe     Broccoli Rabe Combo   No explanation of whats in a combo (its just where they add cheese by the way)  The table placecard (instead of menu) had a more detailed description than the website.    When I walked in, its more bar than restaurant, no big deal, but there were tables.  Since I couldnt decide and the sandwiches werent too expensive at $6.85, I got the roast beef and roast port combos.  I got my two sandwiches fast enough, but the roast beef was cold and the roast pork was hot.  Not sure how a cook (for lack of a better word) could serve 2 things at the same time with such a temperature differential, one was obviously sitting for awhile.  I asked the waitress to reheat the roast beef while I finished the roast pork, and supposedly it was reheated, since it was warmer, but it was still cold-ish compared to my roast pork I had just finished.  The waitress did offer to replace it when she inquired, but I was in a hurry and didnt really care for a hot version of this sandwich.  The sandwiches were very skimpy on meat, but they \"made up for it\" by adding too much gravy to make it overly messy and the bread was disintegrating.  The menu place card mentions the \"wet meat\" option where you get less gravy, I strongly recommend you get it that style, especially if the gravy overpower the meat and structural integrity of the sandwich.",
    "Picked up takeout from Village Whiskey (so I can't review the actual restaurant). The Whiskey Burger is pricy ($26) but is amazing if you're ok with a greasier burger. Super tender, the bacon is awesome and it's pretty big. If you can get past the price then highly recommend it. The Duck Fat fries are also rich and delicious.",
    "Blew $80 on food for the family was worth it food was hot and orange chicken best I've tasted in a awhile..now it will be the place we get Asian food!!",
    "I typically do my laundry at my boyfriend's house, but I had family who recently stayed with me and had a bunch of towels, sheets, and comforters to wash.  I was searching for a laundry mat that would be safe, clean and not full of questionable people.  I was so happy to find this facility.  It is clean, well-lit, and the staff is so friendly and helpful.  I was amazed at the speed of the laundry and dryer.  I completed 4 oversize loads ( probably equal to 8 regular loads) in just under 2 hours!  This place has security cameras, flat screen T.V's, magazines, wi-fi, clean bathrooms, vending machines.  It is a wonderful atmosphere to do your laundry.  It was not overly busy, there are plenty of washers and dryers.  I am so happy that I found this place.  Thank you LAUNDROMAT!!!",
    "We ran in for a late night dinner last night. The prices are definitely high. Both couples decided to split a plate (you could tell the annoyed our server), and the food was good- but not worth the price for sure. I will say the garlic bread they bring out before the meal was AH-MAZING! I could have probably eaten my weight in just the bread.   Overall - I probably wouldn't eat there again myself. But it could have been an off night. There is just too much competition in the food world around St Louis!",
    "Stopped by to munch a burger during today's Seahawks/Saints game, and the place was, unsurprisingly, packed. For good reason, too: the Haven burger I ordered was fantastic.  I sat right next to the door, so I didn't get the chance to get more than six feet into the place; as soon as I got my meal, the place started getting busier and busier until I had to work my way through the World's Shortest People Maze to get out. Guess that means I wasn't the first person to hear about the place.  I will be going back to the Haven. Might go for, say lunch on a Tuesday, so it's less busy.",
    "I can only comment on the vermicelli bowls because I have never had the Pho.   The vermicelli are a decent size and a fair price. Conveniently located if you live in the Alberta Ave neighbourhood, my orders have always been ready in 15 minutes - even on a Friday night.",
    "I had the Chicken Marsala recommended by our waiter. The chicken was very thin, tough, and dry. The pasta was under cooked and stuck together. There was absolutely no flavor. My friend ordered the lasagne and did not like it all. There was only a thin layer of pasta and no flavor. My other friend was still eating her dinner and they cleared her plate when she went to the restroom, after she told the waiter she was not finished. They did bring her a new meal in a doggie bag. The positives are a Great atmosphere and live music. I enjoyed dancing with my husband. However, very expensive for awful food.",
    "This place is a gem.Attractive space, great location near Broad Street line, plenty on street parking. BYOB. I've been twice and enjoyed every dish. Highlights were the chaats, beef short ribs, lamb vindaloo, beet salad, breads/pickles, and chai. We got the chocolate cake for the table to share each time and everyone loved it. Can get takeout beer at the corner bar. We'll be back.",
    "This is my favorite restaurant!  I always order their ceviche, which is delicious.  The atmosphere is fun, and the service is great.  Alex was our server, and he was friendly, attentive and thoughtful.",
    "Love this store!  Who doesn't!  The salad bar is fresh and they have all types of ethnic food to try.  N-JOY",
    "Called in a Mediterranean chicken shawarma. Good flavor and they were generous with the amount of chicken in the pita. The food was ready to go when I arrived. Good service. I would revisit the next time I am in the area.",
    "I love this place.  The food is great and the space and staff are very pleasant.  Highly recommended for vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike.",
    "Took a while to get actual service but once we did I was happy. The gumbo was awesome and loved the chicken & waffles. Friendly staff and right on Bourbon St for good people watching!",
    "As airport grab-and-go restaurants are, Earl does a decent job with a variety of sandwich options including turkey, tuna and even a Hawaiian. But today I could smell the roast beef and so I got that one. Yum. Good portion of sliced beef that was beyond medium cooked with cheddar cheese and a yummy horseradish sauce. Nope, don't get lettuce or tomatoes on it. It's perfect the way it is.  And since it's right between the security station and the top of the D gates (right near the Delta SkyClub!), it's easy to get and eat at the gate or on board.",
    "WOW!  What a fantastic place!  Food A+, Service A+++  We started with an appetizer of cheese curds served with a red pepper jelly.  LOVED IT!  I ordered the fish tacos and the wife ordered a beer brat for dinner.  We both thoroughly enjoyed what we ordered!  The portions were huge and priced just right for the portion size.  Our server was on it!  Very attentive and was very knowledgeable about the menu and made us feel very welcomed.  The manager stopped by and asked how everything was.  I let him know that I am pretty sure I have found a cool new place to hang out, have a beer and watch football.  He said they have great deals on game days and let us know about their brunch on the weekends.  Everyone said goodbye as we walked out and reminded us to grab a rootbeer candy on our way out.  I will be back!",
    "I stopped in for dinner and a drink & was thoroughly pleased! I rarely order a burger when I go out to eat, because why order \"out\" what you can make easily a home, right? Well..... when I go back I'll have a hard time NOT getting another burger. Oh, they also have a decent beer selection and the wait staff/bartenders made me feel very welcomed too.  My food was prepared exactly as I ordered and was served quickly.  The restaurant has a nice atmosphere and the restrooms were clean.  All in all I was very happy! ."

    "If you choose to dine here, please keep in mind that the whole experience will likely take about 2 hours. Despite giving it multiple tries in the hopes of enjoying it, the service tends to be slow, with the food taking a considerable amount of time to be served. The waitstaff is generally young, yet friendly. However, due to consistently long wait times, we often opt for other dining establishments on weekends for a quicker meal.",
    "I have attended numerous spin classes in the past, but none are as impressive as the ones offered at Body Cycle. The facility is clean and well-maintained, equipped with top-quality bikes. The instructors are friendly, motivational, and create challenging workouts. The online scheduling system allows for easy planning, eliminating the need to line up early like many other gyms.\n\nI must acknowledge Russell, the owner of Body Cycle, for his dedication to fitness and cycling.

    "Family-friendly restaurant with a diverse buffet featuring a variety of tasty items such as a large chicken leg, fried jalapeño, tamale, rolled grape leaves, and fresh melon. The Mexican options are plentiful and they offer breakfast all day alongside their buffet. The staff is attentive and welcoming, making it the perfect spot for a laid-back meal without any fuss. Conveniently located next to the Clarion Hotel.",
    "Wow! The lamb curry and korma are our favorite dishes here. They offer 10 different types of naan that you can enjoy. Don't be discouraged by the appearance of the restaurant, as we almost considered not going in ourselves. Give it a try and explore something different – you won't regret it!",
    "The charming interior and the friendly owner gave us a tour of the upcoming patio/rooftop area, which will be perfect on beautiful days like today. The cheese curds were tasty and satisfying. I appreciated that the sandwiches came with a salad, especially after indulging in too many curds! I ordered the onion, gruyere, and tomato sandwich, which had just the right amount of cheese for my liking. It could have used an additional flavor element, perhaps some pepper jelly. I hope they add more menu options, such as salads with interesting cheeses. They have a good selection of beer and wine, with a few cocktail choices. Next time, I plan to try one of the draft wines.",
    "I have been a loyal customer of this establishment for a long time. Today, I went in to order three appetizers for takeout, but was informed that they were too busy to accommodate my request. Despite the fact that the restaurant was only half full, I was disappointed by their response. As a regular patron and generous tipper, I will be taking my business elsewhere. I am pleased to have discovered Kanella, and I have no intention of returning to Dmitris in the future.",
    "I enjoyed this tour a lot! I used a groupon and got it for a great price. It was a great way to explore New Orleans for someone like me who had never been there and didn't know much about the city's history. Our tour guide shared many interesting facts about the city, and I really liked the whole experience. I highly recommend this tour. I initially thought we would only visit the cemetery, but she showed us around the French Quarter first for an hour, and then we went to the cemetery for the rest of the tour. We met in front of a grocery store, which may seem odd at first, but it's easy to find and gives you a chance to grab some water. There's also a bathroom break at a visitor center midway through the tour if needed. This tour was one of the highlights of my trip!",
    "Incredibly delicious wings paired with homemade bleu cheese are just the beginning! The ribeye was tender, perfectly prepared, and downright delicious. Plus, they offer a fantastic selection of craft beers. You absolutely must uncover this hidden gem - it's a culinary experience not to be missed!",
    "This Easter, instead of visiting Lopez Lake, we opted for a trip to the Los Padres National Forest, which is incredibly beautiful. Yet, if you plan to visit White Rock, it's important for the staff to clear away the dead grass encroaching on the rock and the water. I also hope they will make an effort to remove the dead grass near the water's edge. The water appears green and murky. The staff at Los Padres National Forest must dedicate themselves to keeping this forest maintained and picturesque, rather than resembling a landfill. Even Cachuma Lake seems to have put in more effort.",
    "We had a party of 6 at a hibachi restaurant. Our waitress served our separate sushi orders on one plate, making it hard to tell whose was whose, and she forgot several items from our order. The restaurant was surprisingly quiet, which was unexpected for a hibachi experience. Our cook, Francisco, cooked well but didn't say much. The service felt off, the food was decent, and I hope it was just an off night. Overall, for the price, I wouldn't return.",
    "I had a wonderful experience with Shalimar when I needed to resize my engagement ring. Over the phone, they said it could likely be done the same day. When I brought it in, the team confirmed they could accommodate my request for $40. Despite my mistake in the size, Shalimar resized the ring perfectly at no extra charge. Their understanding and quick service truly impressed me, making me a loyal and satisfied customer.",
    "Locals highly recommend Milktooth, praising it as a remarkable gem of Indianapolis. I am glad to have had the opportunity to experience it.",
    "I enjoy coming here for happy hour or dinner! The patio is great with fans to keep cool in the St. Louis heat. This place is very accommodating. I recommend trying the Veal Milanese with mixed greens instead of pasta, they are willing to customize dishes to your liking.",
    "Delight in the flavors of the ethereal gnocchi with marinara and the scrumptious baked eggplant appetizer – they truly stole the show! While the service may have been a tad sluggish, the delectable food overshadows any wait time. Count me in for a return visit – that's how much I adored the food!",
    "The bun elevates the Sonoran Dog to a whole new level of comfort, like a cozy embrace for your taste buds. Initially seemingly over-the-top, it surprises with its perfect balance of warmth, softness, and indulgence. It outshines even the most renowned Sonoran Dogs out there. While the hot dog and bacon could use a bit more bite to stand out against the bold mustard and onions, the carne asada caramelo takes the spotlight with its delicious combination of flavors. All this goodness at an unbeatable price and the convenience of a drive-through.",
    "Had a fantastic breakfast experience at this spot! The waffle was perfectly fluffy, while the home fries were nicely smashed and had a delightful crunch. The waitstaff was super friendly. I'll definitely return in the future!",
    "Great service provided by Douglas complemented the delicious food. While the establishment is on the pricier side with an average main course cost of $40-50, it successfully delivers an atmosphere that rivals any top-tier restaurant nationwide.",
    "My husband and I have dined here many times and we've enjoyed every part of the meal on each visit. The staff, from servers to the bartender, is very knowledgeable about the menu and was able to recommend items that are safe for me to eat as-is, or make substitutions or omissions for my Celiac condition. The wine and cocktail menus are excellent and the food is divine. My only request would be for a gluten-free dessert option, as we have had to go elsewhere for something sweet. Overall, I still plan to return here repeatedly.",
    "I visit a blow bar for my brow appointment with Natalie, who is a brow specialist that I highly recommend. She does an excellent job on my eyebrows! I also received a blowout from Victoria, and I was impressed. Despite having thin, straight, lifeless hair, she gave me the biggest volume I've ever had! I tried another stylist afterward but didn't like the result as much, so Victoria will be my go-to stylist forever. The place is very beautiful and clean!",
    "My favorite cafe in the city has to be this one. The black and white latte they serve is probably the best I've ever tasted - not too sweet with just the right amount of foam. Their soups are consistently delicious, even for those who aren't big soup fans, and there's plenty of room to work. The ambiance is just right with the perfect noise level and music volume, and I love it when customers bring their dogs. I'll definitely continue to support this cafe as long as I can.",
    "WOWZA! Real pumpkin pie swirled in with the frozen custard....can you believe it? Why hasn't this exploded into the biggest sensation across the nation? The absolute highlight was those delightful chunks of pie crust. It's like discovering a treasure within a treasure. Absolutely delicious!",
    "Upland Brewery, originating from Bloomington, Indiana, has expanded to multiple locations in central Indiana due to its increasing popularity. While all their beers are exceptional and their burgers and tenderloins are favorites of mine, the pizza did not meet my high expectations. The margherita pizza had a thin, cracker-like crust and lacked depth in flavor despite the good quality cheese. Disappointingly, the absence of red sauce deviated from the traditional margherita pizza. In my view, Upland's pizza may suit as a decent appetizer for a group gathering, but for future visits, my preference remains with their burgers or tenderloins as a satisfying meal choice.",
    "I was completely engrossed by the show - the perfect way to unwind on a Friday evening.",
    "This is the go-to spot for sushi in our town! Whenever those sushi cravings hit and you're short on time, this place has got you covered. Their salmon is an absolute standout - it's a must-order every time we visit. And don't even get me started on their spicy edamame, tempura, ocean salad, and cabbage salad - they are all just so good! Plus, the service here is always friendly and quick, making the whole experience even better!",
    "I was indecisive between rating this establishment with 3 or 4 stars. Having a fondness for the 96th street Naked Tchopstix, I eagerly anticipated visiting this location, which is conveniently closer to my residence. The ambience here is distinctively oriented towards takeout, although they do offer a reasonably spacious dining area. Upon arrival, customers place their orders at the counter for subsequent delivery.\n\nDuring my visit with my daughter, we opted for the sushi bowl. Customers are provided with a paper form to customize their bowl by choosing from a selection of proteins, vegetables, rice, and toppings. I appreciate this method as it eliminates the need for guesswork or the necessity to speak loudly over the counter to communicate preferences to the server.\n\nWhile the sushi bowl was satisfactory, it did not exceed expectations. I found the variety of vegetables somewhat limited, and the proportion of rice compared to other ingredients seemed unbalanced. However, the sauces complemented the dish nicely. On the contrary, my husband ordered the Maui roll, a personal favorite from the 96th street location, which did not meet the same high standard. Although enjoyable, the quality and consistency of this roll did not match that of the 96th street spot.\n\nDespite the aforementioned shortcomings, I would consider revisiting this establishment. Many patrons may find satisfaction in the sushi bowls offered here. I would like to address negative reviews regarding the service. Given that it is a sushi-focused establishment rather than a fast-food chain like McDonald's, patrons should expect a slightly longer wait time for their orders. One should not anticipate an expedited dining experience akin to fast food despite the restaurant's name touting \"express\" service. The slight delay is ultimately worthwhile for those seeking a healthy fast-food alternative in the vicinity.\n\nFurthermore, I recommend trying the bubble tea. I particularly enjoyed the strawberry variant, but intend to sample the vanilla chai on my next visit.",
    "Had a delicious lunch with an awesome beef brisket sandwich – so juicy and tender! The pulled pork was just as good.",
    "\"The thai cuisine at this establishment is exceptional and truly authentic. Every dish we tried was not only delicious but also delivered an authentic taste. Needless to say, we will be returning to enjoy this culinary experience time and time again.\"",
    "The service left much to be desired and the food was fairly average. In hindsight, I regret not choosing a different dining spot for my final meal in town.",
    "My wife and I enjoyed a delightful dinner at this restaurant over the weekend and were extremely satisfied! The food was exceptional, and we were impressed by the quick service. We particularly liked that everything tasted homemade and fresh. The only challenge was deciding what to order from the tempting menu with so many delicious options. We look forward to coming back to try more dishes and discover the upcoming chef specials!",
    "I must give this restaurant two stars for the decent food. During a dinner meeting where I spent $100 on entrées and appetizers, I had to ask the assistant cook (the guy in bright red baggy pants watching TV) for extra avocado for my tuna. He couldn't assist me and directed me to ask my waitress to add the $4 avocado to the bill.",
    "\"First time visiting and it was amazing!!! It feels like you're entering a friend's house. The waiters are funny and kind. The food comes out very quickly and it's exceptional!!! I will definitely be returning to this place.\"",
    "Exciting news for all food enthusiasts! Indulge in succulent burgers, crispy fries, and refreshing salads bursting with flavors. The burgers here boast a delightful touch of salt and pepper to titillate your taste buds. Step into this charming location with cozy outdoor seating and be greeted by a warm and friendly staff. Convenient street parking is available, along with a parking lot at the back. Get ready for a dining experience like no other!",
    "Outstanding staff who are always friendly and helpful in a clean and spacious store, ensuring it is fully stocked with all your needs. They create my perfect custom breakfast bagel with ease.",
    "I brought my vehicle here a few years ago for some work due to a manufacturer recall. After the initial problem was resolved, I started hearing another noise which I assumed was related, but it turned out to be a completely different issue. Kevin and his mechanic lifted my car and fixed the problem FREE OF CHARGE, despite my offer to pay. Their exceptional service and generosity are truly commendable. I highly recommend them!",
    "After my eye-opening experience at another Sweet CeCe's, I couldn't help but realize that I had neglected to share my thoughts on the gem right in my own backyard! Let me tell you, I am absolutely smitten with their delectable offerings. Utterly enamored, you could say. Not only do they offer a delightful array of toppings that strike the perfect balance between indulgence and health, but the product itself is simply divine. Yet, I must confess, there are moments when the attention of the staff falters, leaving one to fend for oneself. On occasion, gentle reminders about ongoing deals may be necessary. Nevertheless, my affection for this place runs deep, warranting no less than a solid 4-star rating in my book. Sweet CeCe's has truly captured my heart.",
    "Check out this fantastic new spot in the Funk Zone! Enjoy delicious bites and tastings in a superb setting right next to the Santa Barbara Wine Collective. The best part? They share the same tables! Don't miss their fabulous savory croissant - it's a must-try! Life is good here.",
    "This is a delightful and tranquil establishment for receiving massages. Securing same-day appointments is effortlessly accessible. I have consistently been impressed by the high level of skill and professionalism exhibited by every therapist at the Center.",
    "We arrived around 2:30 pm and the check-in process was quick and easy, including complimentary valet parking which was a nice touch. The Peppermill is quite large and it reminded us of Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. They have about eight restaurants on-site offering a wide variety of food options. The casino area is expansive, comparable to what you would find in Las Vegas. However, we did notice that several slot machines were labeled as penny machines but had minimum bets ranging from 30 cents to $5, which was a bit misleading.\n\nOur room was located in the Tuscany Tower on the 12th floor and had a lovely view of the pool area. It was spacious and equipped with free WiFi, a generous bathroom featuring a large shower with two shower heads, a TV, a sizeable jetted bathtub, and even a phone next to the toilet. The bathroom had dual sinks, ample counter space, and plenty of towels. The main area of the room contained a king-sized bed with nightstands, a closet, a TV, a mini-fridge, a dresser with two drawers, a safe, a table for working or writing, complimentary bottles of water, as well as three well-upholstered chairs and a table.\n\nThe thermostat worked well in maintaining a comfortable temperature. The staff were all friendly and helpful, making our stay enjoyable. Overall, it was a very pleasant experience and we had a good time at the Peppermill.",
    "My partner and I visited a new deli today and tried their offerings for the first time. I enjoyed a turkey, avocado, and bacon panini, while he had a buffalo chicken wrap. We had a positive experience and plan to visit again. The food was served promptly, which is great during the busy lunch period. The deli offered a wide variety of options including salads, soups, macaroni, sandwiches, and hot meals, making it a preferred choice for us.",
    "Delicious biscuits and (fill in the blank)! Fantastic cocktails as well. Definitely worth trying out, although it can get a little crowded at times.",
    "The food was excellent, the atmosphere is reminiscent of a lively fishing lodge, and the menu strikes a perfect balance between Outback and Bonefish. Thanks to a Groupon deal, all three of our meals and the calamari appetizer were cooked to perfection! We can't wait to go back!",
    "Check out our fantastic dining option where affordability meets satisfaction! 👌\n\n🌟 The highlights: \n- Fantastic prices\n- Convenient location\n- Delicious desserts including a variety of options like baked and fried chicken, mashed potatoes, salad bar (and more!)\n- Exceptional service from our amazing waitress\n\n😐 The so-so aspects: \n- Behind-the-counter meat slicing station\n- Unimpressive shrimp offerings\n- Mexican station may not meet expectations\n\n👎 What to skip:\n- Disappointing breakfast offerings, especially the eggs\n- Le Benedict falls short with ham and English muffin\n- Lackluster steak and shrimp dishes\n- Breaded items missed the mark\n- Outdated 1970s decor\n\nGive us a try – we're here to turn your dining experience around! 🍽️🎉",
    "The sole reason for withholding a 5-star rating from this restaurant was a singular interaction with a pretentious waiter. As a four-night guest at Hotel Palomar, the restaurant’s location stands out as a definitive perk. On my first evening there, I met a colleague for cocktails in the restaurant. Upon arrival, the host staff seemed preoccupied, prompting us to seat ourselves at a small table by the bar. When a waiter approached us, I inquired about seating before proceeding to order cocktails. The waiter's response was hesitant and unconvincing, leaving us with a sense of indifference. Despite this initial encounter, we carried on with our conversation, only to find his demeanor distant throughout our visit. When it came time to settle the bill, requesting a split payment due to company policies seemed to pose an unreasonable demand to him. The evening concluded with a lingering sense of astonishment at the rudeness we had encountered. \n\nWhile this experience initially soured our impression, we opted to revisit the restaurant the following evening for cocktails, making sure to steer clear of the previous waiter. Approaching the bar, we were greeted warmly by the bartender who engaged us in pleasant conversation, recommending cocktails and displaying genuine interest in our experience. This bartender, identified possibly as Ben, shone as an exemplary host, offering insights on whiskey, sharing the art of crafting classic cocktails, and entirely embodying the essence of hospitality. His kindness, humor, and engaging demeanor not only redeemed the restaurant but went above and beyond the expected standards of a 4/5-star establishment. Indeed, his exceptional service became the highlight of our evening and reinstated our faith in the venue. \n\nAnd, not to be overlooked, the room service provided by this restaurant was exceptional, with the bacon-wrapped dates and chocolate cake standing out as particularly delicious offerings. Despite encountering one negative encounter, the overall experience was saved by the outstanding service of the bartender and the quality of the food.",
    "I stopped in after a refreshing Sunday morning stroll in the park and was blown away by the amazing food, coffee, and top-notch customer service! The vibe in this place is absolutely fantastic!",
    "One word: \"OVERRATED!\" The wait for the food felt endless. My burger, meant to be cooked medium rare, arrived way overcooked. The Seafood Jambalaya, though decent, failed to impress. The price hardly justified the experience. You can find superior dining options in the French Quarter. While it wasn't intolerable, based on all the hype, one would anticipate a far superior culinary adventure.",
    "I was thoroughly impressed by the cozy bed, delicious breakfast, speedy internet, ideal location, and affordable rates at this place. However, guests on the higher floors might experience up to a 15-minute wait for the elevator in the mornings.",
    "Never again will I visit this so-called restaurant that lacks all the essential elements of proper service. Despite its ability to prepare food, much of the dining experience is left to the customer. Thirsty? You'll need to fetch your own water from across the yard. Craving a drink? Head up a flight of stairs to pay with cash. Want to relax in a grungy outdoor space with unkempt lawn chairs? Go right ahead. The wait staff only plays a minor role by bringing you your food after you've paid at the window - similar to New Orleans Hamburger and Seafood, but with a grubbier setting and live music (a nice touch). This was a unique experience for me, one that I won't be repeating.",
    "If you prefer to pay for items individually, this is the place for you. The food was okay but not outstanding. We were served a basket of chips and tomato sauce, and requested spicier options like pico de gallo. The server happily brought them, and the salsa was an improvement. When we asked for drinks, I requested a fountain Coke, but was informed they only had bottled Pepsi. It wasn't mentioned earlier that only bottled drinks were available. We ordered our reasonably priced food and requested sour cream and cheese for the taco. We were informed that cheese was an additional charge. Another basket of chips cost $2.50 extra. Surprisingly, we ended up paying more for condiments than for the actual food. Sour cream was $2.00, pico de gallo $2.50, salsa $2.00, chips $2.50, cheese $1.00, and an unwanted bottled Coke $5.00. A suggestion for future orders: always ask if there are extra charges for additional items.",
    "The coffee shop was incredibly charming. We arrived at 8am and to our surprise, there was a live jazz band performing. I ordered the breakfast sandwich which was delightful - the unique touch of rolling the egg and including bacon pieces was a highlight. The breakfast was satisfying and reasonably priced.",
    "This place is amazing! I was so excited to try their duckfat french fries. I came here with my son for his birthday and we put our name in. While we waited for a table, we had a drink nearby and after about 45 minutes, we were seated at the bar. Keith, the bartender, took care of us and he was friendly and knew a lot about whiskey. We enjoyed Cape May salts and tater tots as appetizers. For dinner, I had the Kentucky Fried Quail, which was delicious, and my son had the $24 Fois Gras burger, which was fantastic. The duckfat fries were tasty, but not the highlight of the meal. I will definitely be returning with all my friends.",
    "We commenced our meal with the artichoke dip, but unfortunately, it was a regrettable choice. The dip was served cold, and the accompanying chips were stale. Despite bringing this matter to the attention of our waitress, no resolution was offered. Our subsequent selection of a large, thin-crust pizza, although admittedly slightly overpriced after the addition of toppings, failed to exceed expectations. The pizza was satisfactory but did not attain culinary greatness. While our server did not take on the role of an advocate, she provided competent service. I have previously dined at this establishment during a Cardinals game and found the experience to be superior. Consequently, I plan to explore alternative dining venues in the future.",
    "My fiance wanted a laid back Thai restaurant for his birthday dinner. We decided on Jasmine Rice based on Yelp reviews, and it was a good choice. We ordered pan-fried dumplings instead of the summer rolls we wanted since they were not available. The dumplings were good, but we wouldn't order them again. The green curry fried rice with duck and chicken pad thai were both delicious, with the duck being the standout. The pad thai was a bit too sweet for our taste. We might try a different noodle dish next time. The service was good overall, but some customers faced issues. Despite that, the owner ensured one customer received the missing item in their take-out order promptly, which was nice. In general, it was a good quality Thai restaurant, and we would be happy to return.",
    "I adore Courtney! She is undoubtedly the most talented hairstylist I've ever had. What sets her apart is her ability to understand what suits me best and respect my style boundaries. Every time I visit the salon, I simply ask her to work her magic, and I am always amazed by the results. A sign of a great stylist is when they instinctively know what needs to be done without you having to provide detailed instructions. Courtney is not only skilled but also has a wonderful personality and vast knowledge in her field. I wholeheartedly recommend her to anyone who wants to enhance their appearance.",
    "I used to visit this place frequently when I lived in the area. Despite being a chain and lacking a certain appeal, it serves its purpose well. If you require an oil change or a state inspection, this place is sufficient. However, it's best to visit when they aren't busy to avoid a long wait. Overall, it's just your typical Pep Boys—nothing extraordinary, but decent enough.",
    "Two old Lennox units from the 1970s were replaced with two new ones. The installation was performed successfully, and the units have been running efficiently for the past three years.",
    "I love the Brewpub for its diverse menu featuring nachos, pizza, sandwiches, and a variety of house-crafted beers. Although the service may be slow, it encourages you to relax, enjoy the patio, and savor the time with friends. The venue is kid and dog-friendly, catering well to vegetarian and vegan options. Personally, I recommend the half order of nachos or fish & chips. The Pumpkin Seasonal Beer is a must-try and rivals some of my favorite pumpkin brews.",
    "Rustic-chic farmhouse store with a helpful staff offering great home decor ideas at reasonable prices. Find items from Joanna Gaines (Fixer Upper) and more. Finally, a good home store in SB with affordable prices.",
    "My brother's visit turned into an unforgettable night as we set out to find the perfect six pack of quality beers for a cozy evening in. Little did we know that it would lead to an impromptu gaming session on their donated Nintendo 64 playing Super Smash Brothers. Surrounded by good food and even better company, we found ourselves lost in the warm embrace of this remarkable place. It's more than just a spot in the Northeast – it's a charming haven that should be cherished and celebrated by all.",
    "A different take on the passage:\n\nI usually stick to my favorite dishes of coconut soup and pad thai with protein, and this time was no exception. Surprisingly, I found the coconut soup here to be quite delightful. It had just the right balance of coconut milk, resulting in a rich and creamy texture without being overwhelmingly herbal. Coming from a background of heavily Americanized Thai cuisine, I appreciate dishes with a lighter herb profile, with the exception of cilantro. The pad thai didn't disappoint either. The amount of peanuts added was just right, the noodles were perfectly chewy, and the dish wasn't overly sweet. I was pleased to find a generous portion of juicy chicken, and the white meat was exceptionally tender. Overall, my dining experience left me completely satisfied.",
    "Great service! The restaurant has delicious diner food available all day, including breakfast. I went for lunch and it was quite busy, but the staff was very friendly and welcoming. Conveniently located off the 295 highway.",
    "My favorite bar on Saturdays! Disappointed by Lucy's closing, but found a great spot across the street with better-than-expected food. Love their wings and fries, but watch out for the spicy sauce. Service can be slow with the bar being busy, but it's worth it. And you might even spot the Always Sunny crew!",
    "We were hesitant about giving the Shellfish Company on the Wharf a try, as similar establishments in places like Cannery Row, Monterey often take advantage of a captive audience by offering subpar food at high prices. Despite our reservations, encouraged by the consistently positive reviews on Yelp, we set aside our initial concerns and decided to give it a shot. The restaurant is small, so it's wise to plan ahead. Expect a wait, so either be prepared to wait patiently or consider visiting during off-peak hours. Fortunately, our wait was only around 20 minutes since the dinner rush was dying down. The featured item was the local rock crab - $25 for 3 lbs of California Rock Crab, along with salad and a choice of soup or chowder. After seeing the generous portions of rock crab being served, both my wife and I opted for it. The salad and chowder combo was satisfying, with ample servings of each, making for a solid start. Despite enjoying the chowder, my wife found the Shrimp Bisque she ordered to be exceptional, so I would recommend trying that in the future. But enough about the side dishes - the rock crab was just as delicious as it appeared. The juicy, buttery white crab meat was a delight, requiring minimal effort to extract the meat. Although the rock crab shells were thick, they cracked easily, indicating perfect cooking. The rock crabs provided a substantial amount of meat for what felt like minimal effort, especially compared to other types of crab. We left the meal thoroughly content, and with the value offered by the special, savoring the Rock Crab at SBSC became one of the highlights of our trip. Ordering crab here seems to be a reliable choice.",
    "I love Weaver's Way and disagree with some reviews. It's not just for quick shopping. As a single woman, I find it convenient with smaller quantities. I enjoy the work hours, like contributing to the membership committee. The community isn't just \"tree huggers\" but diverse like-minded individuals. I appreciate the local produce and wholesome foods. Membership fees and work hours are reasonable. Weaver's Way is great if you value its principles. If not, visit as a guest or stick to chain stores.",
    "The food at this establishment may not be exceptional, yet it appears to be highly regarded by many patrons. Although I accompany my husband due to his preference for this dining spot, I personally prefer an alternative BBQ venue. It is important to note that the dining experience may be influenced by the specific dishes one chooses to order.",
    "The television programs cost $4.99 and come with commercials! This strategy to generate revenue seems tacky and indicates a lack of sophistication in the hotel, especially considering the nightly rate is over $150. Additionally, there is no free breakfast, only a costly buffet, a service even budget hotels in California offer.",
    "I made a brief stop at this location due to its proximity to the hotel where I was accommodated. The personnel at the establishment displayed exceptional kindness and warmth. I was particularly impressed by their buy one, get one deal. Furthermore, I sampled their hot wings, which were quite enjoyable, featuring a generous serving of sauce. I look forward to returning to this establishment during my next visit to avail myself of their delicious pizza offerings.",
    "I have exclusively sampled the cannolis at this establishment, and they are truly exceptional! These delectable treats are expertly filled upon ordering, boasting a filling of unparalleled quality. With a perfectly balanced sweetness that is not overwhelming, these cannolis are sure to delight. Whether you are an aficionado of cannoli or have yet to discover your fondness for this delightful treat, a visit to Termini Bros. is highly recommended.",
    "While journeying in our RV, we made a pit stop at Granite City and stumbled upon this charming cafe. The moment we walked in, the staff greeted us warmly. The food here is reminiscent of homemade dishes. We dined here on two occasions, and each time, our meals were fresh, flavorful, and reminiscent of home-cooked food. Delicious!",
    "I discovered a hidden gem in the Magazine area after working there for 3 weeks. The staff is so welcoming, and let me tell you, their Phò is absolutely fantastic!",
    "Our family came back for breakfast this weekend and once again, the food and service were outstanding. We highly recommend it.",
    "The kayaking tour at Santa Cruz Island was fantastic! My husband and I enjoyed exploring the caves with our helpful and informative guide, Jen. The tour exceeded our expectations and we had a wonderful time.",
    "Highly recommended for those seeking a delightful dining experience without breaking the bank! Don't miss out on the tantalizing shrimp and goat cheese crepes - an absolute must-try!",
    "After more than a decade in the thriving city of St. Louis, I finally set foot in this iconic spot just a few weeks ago! Let me tell you, I'm kicking myself for not coming sooner. This place is absolutely fantastic— and the sheer diversity of experiences it offers is astounding! Step into a world where you can take a captivating factory tour (available Friday to Sunday, from noon to 5 pm, every hour), explore the bustling shop, unwind at the lively bar, or savor a delicious meal in the inviting dining area. And that's not all - be entertained with live music during their exciting weekend events. There's never a dull moment here!\n\nPrepare for a bit of waiting time before you dine, but trust me, it's worth it. From the velvety smooth Hefeweizen to mouthwatering homegrown dishes, the beer and food selections are top-notch. I highly recommend the pizza— it's truly exceptional! Oh, and if you're a pizza aficionado like me, you're in for a treat. And don't miss out on the bison burger either; it's a real delight.\n\nHere's the real kicker— the service here is stellar. Expect a team of vibrant and unconventional individuals (think tattoo parlor vibes) which only adds to the overall charm. The emphasis on local produce and craft beer truly sets this place apart. Sure, it might be a bit more on the expensive side, but the quality and unforgettable experiences make it all worthwhile. I'm definitely going back for more, and you should too!",
    "I am sorry to hear about your experience at the burger place. It sounds frustrating to have received a burger with bacon when you ordered a plain one, especially considering your allergy. It's unfortunate that the staff's response was not as accommodating or friendly as expected. On the bright side, it's great that you have found an alternative in Freebirds that you enjoy! It's always nice to have a variety of dining options to choose from. Enjoy your future visits to Freebirds!",
    "I had a fantastic experience during my first visit here. The car wash and service were top-notch, and I left feeling extremely satisfied. Many thanks for the excellent service!",
    "I recently discovered Sushi Nara, which just opened this month, and I've quickly fallen in love with it. The restaurant is spotless, the staff is welcoming and accommodating, and the service is speedy. The sushi is consistently delightful as I've visited three times already, and the prices are quite reasonable. My husband recently picked up takeout there, purchasing four sushi rolls for a total of just $24, which is an incredible deal. I appreciate the freshness of the food and the extensive variety available. I highly recommend this place to everyone on the eastside!",
    "This charming boutique boasts an exceptional selection. The owner is incredibly knowledgeable and passionate about their work, evident in the unique tires and parts they offer, unavailable elsewhere.",
    "I frequently visit this hidden gem in Florissant for their delicious Panang curry. I have yet to try their sister restaurant because I am always satisfied with the food here.",
    "The food may have only earned a modest two stars, yet the ambiance and innovative menu at this eatery have captured my attention. Despite this promise, my dining experience left something to be desired; the tomato-basil soup resembled a lackluster marinara, while the tuna melt was marred by a jarring citrusy note. Perhaps an excess of lemon zest was to blame for its overpowering taste? Nevertheless, I am drawn to explore other offerings, particularly the dishes featuring cured Italian meats like mortadella and prosciutto. The bakery items, notably the enticing Nutella bruschetta, also warrant a taste on my next visit.",
    "We went there once and man, we were totally let down by my veggie pizza and my husband's sub sandwich. The tomato sauce was meh, and they skimped on the cheese on my pizza. And don't even get me started on how the dough seemed like it came straight out of a factory. Maybe things are better now, but honestly, we're not itching to give it another shot anytime soon.",
    "A few friends and I dropped by More Than Just Ice Cream for some late-night milkshakes and had a great time! Even though we only indulged in ice cream (missing out on the other goodies the name promises), it was still a delightful experience. We tried three milkshake flavors - coffee, chocolate, and black & white malt, and they were all pretty good. Our ice cream cravings were definitely satisfied! I felt that my coffee and chocolate milkshakes could have been thicker, but the black & white malt was a standout. I regret not choosing that one! Before settling on a milkshake, I sampled the pumpkin pie ice cream, which was absolutely amazing. I should've just gone for that! Perhaps next time, ice cream flavors rather than milkshakes will be my go-to choice at this wonderful spot.",
    "My husband and I recently celebrated my mother's 100th birthday here and it was an absolutely unforgettable experience! The exceptional treatment we received surpassed all expectations - from scoring the perfect table with a breathtaking view, to indulging in mouthwatering \"compliments of the chef\" extras, to being presented with a beautifully decorated cake plate by the attentive and friendly servers. It truly was a special occasion that exceeded our wildest dreams and left a lasting impression on us.",
    "This place is great! The bartender is awesome and the food is fresh with local ingredients. The plates look amazing, the beer is cold, and the drinks are perfect. It's a dedicated local restaurant with good employees.",
    "I visited this restaurant a total of 4 times during my 5-day stay - now, that's quite a feat, isn't it? Here's why: - Our nearby hotel made it convenient. - Their opening hours, from 11 am to 10:30 pm daily (yes, even on New Year's Day!), perfectly suited our schedule. - With just a party of two, we always got seated promptly. - At just $9 per dozen oysters, it's an unbeatable deal! - The adjacent seafood shop offers a variety of boiled and fresh seafood to-go. - Our friendly server, who recognized us each time, added a personal touch. But, let's get to the 3-star reasons: - Despite trying various dishes, they were all rather average. The raw oysters weren't well-cleaned. If you can, consider visiting Superior Seafood during happy hours for higher quality oysters at 50 cents each. The turtle soup had an odd taste; Felix's version is more to my liking. Some of the boiled shrimps were disappointingly mushy - perhaps overcooked? - Though the ambiance is nice, it's not very cozy, and we found ourselves eating quickly and leaving. - And a plea to clean the bathroom! If we're in the area again, we might drop by or simply grab some quick seafood to-go.",
    "If you want a pleasant dining experience, it's best to avoid this disaster of a meal. Our server was so unaware that we wondered if she had lost her way in the restaurant. We had to request basic necessities like utensils, water refills, and so on. Contrary to ordering chicken parmesan, we received eggplant parmesan with a fish bone in it instead. On a positive note, the drinks were enjoyable.",
    "My impression of TDS is rather lackluster. The establishment, though not literally cold, exudes a sense of chilliness in its ambiance. The absence of decor and menu boards, the use of stainless steel prep tables as dining surfaces, and the presence of numerous unidentified staff members without clear insignias (such as shirts or nametags) all contributed to this underwhelming atmosphere. While the food is reasonably priced and mostly enjoyable, a notable point of contention was the additional charge for extra salsa. As an illustration, upon requesting extra salsa for his tacos amidst a substantial order consisting of a variety of items, my brother was informed that he would need to repurchase the salsa trio containing three samples of different salsas in 2oz glass bowls. This stipulation struck us as rather exorbitant, particularly considering our total expenditure of over $40 on meals, beverages, and appetizers. In light of these factors, despite the satisfactory quality of the food, I am disinclined to revisit TDS due to its lackluster environment and the restriction on acquiring supplementary salsa for one's tacos.",
    "I am thrilled with our pictures from Angela Clifton Photography! We have had the pleasure of working with them three times now, and each picture captured has brought us immense joy. Not only are the photos stunning, but the experience itself was enjoyable. The pricing is very fair, and these pictures will be cherished as timeless keepsakes.",
    "I had a lovely meal outside at a sidewalk table. The prices were a bit high, but the food was good. If you're looking for a quieter outdoor dining experience, consider going to Side Street in the French Quarter.",
    "The courthouse is ancient with impressive artwork. The spiral staircase is quirky. From the fifth floor, you can enjoy a panoramic view of the whole city. The clock tower room is surprisingly fascinating, filled with intricate mechanical gears! Make sure to schedule a visit in advance to see the clock room. It's definitely worth spending 2 to 3 hours exploring this place.",
    "I had the pleasure of meeting with Ann today and I must say, she was incredibly helpful and positive. Her exceptional service made my first experience here unforgettable. I am now a loyal customer thanks to her outstanding efforts. Thank you, Ann!",
    "I visited this place for the first time and was pleasantly surprised. I tried a combination meal featuring pad Thai and coconut soup. The soup was delicious, as I had never tasted coconut soup before. The pad Thai met my expectations and was very satisfying. The restaurant had lovely Thai decor and played great music. The staff provided excellent service. In a town with limited food options, this was a refreshing change. It might just become my favorite spot in Carp.",
    "This location exuded such a serene and calming atmosphere. It will surely be on my radar for future visits. The entertainment by the artist was delightful and diverse (imagine a country rendition of \"Let It Go\" - simply splendid!).",
    "If you haven't been to the Smoothie King Center since it was known as the New Orleans Arena, you're in for a pleasant surprise! The arena has received a makeover and looks refreshed. While the seats remain the same, everything else has been updated.\n\nOne of the best improvements is the food options, which now cater to a wide variety of tastes. The food quality has significantly improved from a few years ago. The drink choices have also gotten better, with full-service bars, spiked lemonade, bottled and draft beer, and of course, smoothies. They even have a sweet spot offering funnel cake, cotton candy, and other delicious treats.\n\nOverall, the venue now feels more upscale and classy. It's definitely a step up!",
    "Whenever I have a queasy stomach, Chipotle's steak never fails to make me feel better. I've learned to avoid the busy lunch rush and opt for a peaceful visit between 2 and 4 pm. No matter how busy it is, the service at Chipotle is always friendly and efficient.",
    "I was pleasantly surprised by this place. It exceeded our expectations. It's definitely one of the top Indian restaurants in the Tampa Bay area. The atmosphere is fantastic with elegant white tablecloths. What truly stood out was the delicious food. The chicken 65 was amazing, and the hot and sour soup was packed with flavor. Our server, Angel, was very nice, attentive, and charming. They just started serving a week ago. I believe this will soon become a hotspot for anyone looking for authentic Indian cuisine.",
    "On my third journey to NOLA, the doors finally opened for me. After two failed attempts waiting in line, we cleverly scored reserved seats this time, trading the hassle for the pleasure of lounging on benches. And for an extra $20, it was a small price to pay in support of Jazz preservation; a cause so worthy it feels like a delightful splurge. The show itself was nothing short of mesmerizing. The musicians were not just talented but exuded an old-world charm and charisma that transported me back to concerts of yesteryears. Held in a cozy, hole-in-the-wall venue accommodating a mere 200 guests, the intimacy of the setting allowed for a close-up encounter with the gleeful faces of the performers as they passionately shared their art with us. Undoubtedly, an essential experience for anyone exploring the vibrant streets of NOLA!",
    "Had a great experience at Keystone Discount Tire for a PA State & Emissions inspection. Although I was a new walk-in without an appointment due to a rain delay, they took my 2008 Pontiac Torrent in promptly. The technicians were friendly and allowed me to see any issues, like an alignment concern with my front tires. The inspection was completed quickly, and the bill remained fair without unnecessary add-ons. I highly recommend signing up for their mailing list for coupons.",
    "I'm thrilled that my son's phone, which I never thought could be repaired after he dropped it, was fixed in less than half an hour. The service was very professional and excellent!",
    "Poor service and management: Waiter made mistakes with all four orders, leading to confrontation and cursing. Manager offered complimentary drinks due to the issues. Cold and unappetizing food resulted in an hour-long wait. Will avoid dining at Cracker Barrel in the future due to this disappointing experience.",
    "I have visited several dog-friendly hotels before, but they were usually motel-like and not in a city setting. This particular hotel was located in the heart of the city. Feeling unsure about how my Labrador/Golden Retriever mix would be received, I cautiously entered the hotel lobby. Despite my initial apprehension, the receptionist warmly welcomed us and put us at ease. During check-in, an employee offered treats for Bentley, which she loved. Additionally, they asked if we would like a welcome kit for Bentley, which included dog dishes, a mat, and treats. I was amazed by their hospitality. Other guests at the hotel also complimented and petted Bentley, referring to her as \"queen Bentley.\" Our room was on the top floor, which was fantastic. Even the valets recognized Bentley by name when we went for walks. The exceptional service we received impressed us so much that we decided to extend our stay for an extra night. I want to thank Loews for exceeding my expectations of a dog-friendly hotel, especially for accommodating a large dog like Bentley.",
    "This food can be amazing at times, but its inconsistency is disappointing. I recently ordered a dish I've enjoyed for years, and while it's usually incredible, this time it fell short. It seems like the kitchen staff changes frequently, leading to varying quality. As a result, only about half of the time is the food excellent. Frustrating!",
    "This location is a total disappointment! Visited twice and will never return. The first time was mediocre, but the second visit was unbelievably bad. The ribs I ordered were not cooked properly, having to send them back three times until they were edible. The manager offered a half-hearted apology and did not comp anything. Extremely frustrated by the lack of service and sincerity.",
    "After sampling several ramen establishments boasting an eclectic array of offerings and exquisite broth, my anticipation was somewhat dampened by the ramen experience at Cheu. While acknowledging that taste is subjective, I found myself less enamored by the robust noodles and pervasively salty broth. The impeccable service and diverse beer options were commendable aspects of the visit. In contrast, my companion expressed great enthusiasm for Cheu and has frequented it numerous times. Regrettably, my personal affinity did not align with theirs, though I cordially encourage others to form their own opinion by sampling it firsthand. It appears that my palate may indeed be peculiar in this particular instance.",
    "Federal Doughnuts is a new food stand at the baseball field selling doughnuts and fried chicken. There's also a new gluten-free concession stand near section 136 that serves pizza, cheesesteaks, brownies, and cookies.",
    "Exciting news! A new Red Kings restaurant has popped up in Chinatown, and it exceeded all expectations! Although this spot freshly debuted yesterday, it's unclear whether it's taking over the original Red Kings or just offering up more tantalizing, Szechuan delights. Our takeout order of Dan Dan Noodles and Garlic Pork dish was a flavor explosion with just the right amount of heat. These dishes were a perfect blend of sweet, earthy, and fresh flavors that left our taste buds dancing. The portions were so generous that we're looking forward to enjoying the leftovers. We're already eager to return for a full dinner experience and explore the rest of the menu. Even better, they have karaoke rooms upstairs and allow you to bring your own beverages!",
    "This Chick-fil-A location is impressively busy, yet consistently maintains fast and exceptional service. I am amazed at their efficiency and excellent service every time I visit. It is definitely one of my top favorite places to go.",
    "This is the best place for salads! I make sure to visit it every time I'm in town for lunch. The service is quick, and the vegetables are consistently fresh.",
    "My family and I went on a tour of Oak Alley and Laura Plantation on September 26th, 2015. Our driver's name slips my mind, but he shared interesting facts during our journey to the plantations. The timing of the tour was great! We had free time before and after the tour to explore the properties at our leisure. The drop-off points on the way back were flexible, and we ended up near Jackson Square. It was nice to spend the rest of the afternoon wandering around the French Quarter.",
    "We have visited twice for brunch and loved it. The food is delicious, especially the grits with scallions and sour cream. Just remember to bring a sweater because the room is always cold.",
    "I love this place so much! They have the best hot dogs and chili dogs. I try to come here as often as possible because they are so delicious. Yum!",
    "Sweet spot in the Waterline! Came for some live music with friends on Saturday and was blown away. The ambiance was electrifying, the best local beer in town by far. The concept is a cut above Fig Mountain - Topa is the clear winner. Even cooler, you can savor delectable dishes from the Nook Restaurant and simply walk two feet into Lama Dog, seamlessly part of the Waterline experience. Absolutely love it!",
    "Excellent customer service experience! Even though we were slightly outside their pick-up range, the staff was very accommodating and picked up our group of 7. Upon arrival, we noticed that we were wrongly charged for 8 people instead of 7. I promptly called, and they quickly refunded the extra ticket cost. \n\nThe tour itself was incredibly enjoyable! We had a fantastic time, laughing and smiling throughout, thanks to our funny and engaging tour guide. We were thrilled to spot numerous alligators, from adorable baby ones swimming in the water to impressive full-grown specimens. Additionally, we saw turtles and various bird species during the tour. Our guide even had a baby alligator that we could hold; he is caring for it until it grows a bit more as it was a late hatchling that would not have survived on its own. \n\nThe return trip was just as exciting, with the guide treating us to a thrilling speedboat ride and showcasing some impressive maneuvers. I wholeheartedly recommend this tour to everyone!",
    "Westfall replaced our roof in April and we are extremely satisfied with the whole process. They provided a high-quality roof, excellent communication, and great follow-up. We are very pleased that we selected this company to replace our roof.",
    "The food is tasty, affordable, and the staff is friendly. While it may not be the best place to dine in, the fast-food concept for vegan food is fitting. Though the buffalo bella dish is highly recommended, the Cheesesteak is preferred in my opinion. Additionally, make sure to order the sweet potato fries.",
    "The ramen is fine, nothing to write home about. Service is average. Decent spot for a fast meal, but wouldn't be the first choice. Visited twice already, might visit again.",
    "Satisfy your cravings with our trendy and delicious menu! Get there early to avoid the wait - it's definitely worth it for a truly satisfying experience!",
    "Enjoyed a delicious brisket sandwich with two sides and a drink for just 9.99! Such a great deal for some tasty barbecue. The sides were amazing too - potato casserole, creamed spinach, baked beans, and green beans!",
    "The food and service were absolutely fabulous! My only little wish is that they offered some vegetarian/vegan choices too. I'm already looking forward to my next visit!",
    "Delicious food, but let down by subpar customer service! Despite visiting three times, facing two unhelpful older waitresses made the experience less enjoyable. On the bright side, the owner is a delight to interact with!",
    "I discovered this great breakfast spot from a local on the plane to Nashville. They were right - the food was amazing and we didn't have to wait in line. I had a delicious corn pancake topped with bacon, salsa, and sour cream. This place is a must-visit whenever I return to the South!",
    "Upset about a detailing service appointment with Michael and partner Alex. Confusion over appointment details, shop closed on appointment day, Michael unreachable. Disappointed and frustrated by the experience.",
    "I experienced a myriad of occurrences during the process of relocating, necessitating supplementary services from this establishment. The individuals within this office exhibit superior skills and display admirable integrity. While I am inclined to offer further praise for the exceptional care they bestowed upon me, I am hesitant as they may have exceeded the bounds of their duties. I have no reservations in endorsing this office to even the most discerning individual, including my own mother.",
    "Last year, The Saint was our home base for a fabulous girls' trip, and let me tell you, it was an experience! The moment you step into the lobby, you can't help but be captivated by its charm. With a trendy bar and restaurant adding to the allure, it sets the scene for a perfect weekend getaway. The friendly staff made us feel right at home, setting the stage for what we thought would be a fantastic time.\nI arrived a few hours ahead of my friend to catch up on work. After a productive stint on my laptop, it was time for a quick errand run before her arrival. As we reunited, the mischief began, with dinner plans leading to laughter-filled evenings. However, our carefree atmosphere took a turn for the worse when we encountered a giant flying roach in our room. PANIC! Without missing a beat, I made a beeline for the front desk, demanding immediate action.\nAlthough the staff swiftly moved us to another room, the new space wasn't exempt from critter sightings. With spiders and other unwelcome guests, coupled with malfunctioning tech and missing light bulbs, the disappointment set in. By 3 am, I had made up my mind - we were out! Switching gears, I swiftly booked a room at my trusted refuge, The W, for the remainder of our stay.\nDespite their attempts to rectify the situation the next morning, the misadventures of the night were just too much. I stood my ground, requesting a full refund and bidding farewell to any future stays. Kudos to the accommodating staff member who tried to salvage the situation, but in this tale of hotel horrors, there was no turning back.",
    "If you're looking for a new door with only $35 or have leftover building supplies, the Green Project is the place to go. They offer affordable options and accept donations to prevent waste in landfills.",
    "This establishment is the worst I've ever been to. The bouncer was unnecessarily rude, and it seems like they believe they can mistreat people and overcharge just because they are located on Broadway. As a local resident, I have no intention of visiting again or recommending it to anyone.",
    "Had a fantastic lunch date with my girlfriend! The place was spotless and the food was absolutely delicious! It was also very reasonably priced. We're already looking forward to our next visit!",
    "The disappointing experience at the restaurant occurred on several fronts, as the food quality has significantly declined. A shared artichoke was evidently prepared in advance, resulting in a cold interior and overcooked flesh. A Greek salad was overdressed and lacking in flavor, seemingly sourced from pre-packaged ingredients. The grilled yellowtail was notably disappointing, being overcooked and of low quality, making it inedible. Despite the pleasant ambiance and good service, the subpar food renders this establishment unworthy of a visit. The restaurant must elevate its food quality to avoid becoming another undesirable tourist spot.",
    "Head to Milktooth for unique breakfast cocktails and a twist on traditional brunch dishes. Despite the unfamiliar items on the menu, you'll definitely enjoy your order. Expect a wait at this popular Indy brunch spot, typically about 30 minutes on weekends, but it's absolutely worth it. To help pass the time, grab a drink or pastry from their walk-up bar. Their menu evolves but timeless favorites include different versions of Dutch pancakes and a must-try raclette grilled cheese. Don't miss the michelada if you're opting for a boozy breakfast. If the weather's nice, opt for outdoor seating.",
    "The bar and staff at this place are incredible! They even gave us a room upgrade for our honeymoon, and the view was simply stunning. However, the room itself was not as impressive as we had expected, more like a standard Hilton room. We noticed some rust in the tub and weird stains on the tiles in the bathroom. Despite this, I would still give it 4 stars because the rest of the hotel was great! The staff was friendly and accommodating, although we found the valet parking a bit pricey, so we opted to park a few streets away. This was the only downside, in my opinion. Overall, I would recommend this place if you want to stay right in the heart of the bustling downtown area of St. Louis, surrounded by lots of cool bars and restaurants on a lively Friday night.",
    "I recently started the beginner's class at the studio, and I absolutely enjoyed it! The class had a great pace that kept me engaged throughout, and the movements, while not too challenging, pushed me beyond my limits in unexpected ways! I even worked up a sweat! After the session, I felt fantastic! The studio is pristine, and I appreciate the option to purchase some Beyond Organic food items there as well.",
    "Not sure why it took so long for us to find Lobster Haven, but we're glad we did! Started out at a chain lobster restaurant but were craving something more authentic. Friend suggested Lobster Haven, checked it online - reminded us of dining in Massachusetts. Service was excellent, quick, and friendly. They offer a huge variety of favorites. A must-visit for authentic New England seafood. They also sell live lobster and fresh seafood for you to cook at home.",
    "Fantastic happy hour with a fresh menu and delicious drinks, I wish I could visit every day if I had the time!",
    "Men's clubs is awesome, no doubt about it! All the barbers here have mad skills to make you look fly. I've been a regular for 3 years now and never had any issues, except for this one time when some guy tried to copy my cut. Shoutout to Tim for keeping it real and saying \"I can't give you the same style as Ryan.\" Thanks, Tim!",
    "We are frequent visitors to this restaurant because we truly enjoy the fresh food and excellent service it offers. We highly recommend this place to anyone who is a fan of sushi and hibachi dishes.",
    "Chickie's and Pete's offers a great atmosphere for enjoying sports and treating yourself to some tasty bites. While it may not be the absolute best food around, scoring a seat to savor some beer with crab fries and mussels red is a surefire way to have a fantastic time during a game or a visit to the stadiums. Personal favorites include the crab fries, mussels red (the white mussels can be a bit overwhelming with garlic), the zesty pull and peel shrimp, steamers, and if you're up for it, the blue crabs (a bit messy but worth it). The convenient sinks scattered throughout make it easy to clean up after you've had your fill of finger-licking meals. Overall, Chickie's and Pete's is an iconic spot in Philadelphia that promises a fun experience. I highly recommend giving it a try at least once. Just remember, during major sporting events, expect a full house and some rowdy patrons, so be prepared for a lively atmosphere! 😄",
    "Efficient and courteous. During the weekend. Quick repair of my mirror, but they simplified the process for me. I have utilized their services in Charlotte previously and had a positive experience as well.",
    "Nice pick at Union Station St. Louis! I tried the Ponchartrain (which the server mentioned was similar to Tilapia, though both were on the menu, so who knows why they have two names for the same fish). The Ponchartrain was tasty with mushrooms and a creamy sauce. We also had the shrimp cocktail and lump crab cake apps - they were okay, nothing extraordinary. The drinks and service were decent. We sat outside on the patio because the weather was lovely - the inside looked cozy and less laid-back.",
    "I stopped in for a drink yesterday and must say the atmosphere gets an A+ from me. It's a unique concept for the St. Pete area. The attention to detail in the remodel was outstanding; it almost feels like being in a Harry Potter movie. The background music is set at a low volume so you can easily hear your friends without shouting - perfect for the library-esque environment. Michael and Peggy were friendly and interesting bartenders. I didn't try the food, but the prices for meat and cheese trays are better than other places in the area. I highly recommend checking this place out.",
    "I thoroughly enjoy Maple Street Patisserie. It consistently surpasses my expectations, offering the finest blueberry muffin I have ever had. This establishment excels as a delightful spot for both breakfast and lunch, and is known for its specialty cakes, particularly during events like Mardi Gras where one can indulge in a traditional king cake. Notably, the proprietor, Ziggy, is a diligent individual who devotes long hours to crafting delectable baked goods. Maple Street Patisserie truly stands out as an exceptional dining destination.",
    "The Bourbon Black and Bleu burger I had was really good. It was cooked perfectly and very tasty. However, the wait time for our food was too long. Despite having a big party of 4 adults and 5 kids, it took over an hour to get our food, which was disappointing.",
    "Whenever we have out-of-town guests, Katie's is our go-to place. The variety of food is superb and reasonably priced. Whether you choose grilled oysters, shrimp and grits, Cuban sandwich, pizza, or soup & salad, you will not be disappointed. Daily specials feature local seasonal offerings. The service staff is friendly. On Sundays, arrive early to avoid a wait after church. Enjoy bottomless Mimosas!",
    "I stopped by Creole Creamery after the Zurich Classic golf tournament. It was warm and a bit humid, so I indulged in an ice cream cone. Luckily, I found a street parking spot. The cute and comfy interior and the vast ice cream selection caught my eye. After trying some unique flavors, I chose a scoop of cookie monster ice cream on a cone. It was just right - not too sweet. Creole Creamery is definitely worth a visit!",
    "I absolutely adore this place! I've been a regular here for a couple of years. It has a quirky charm, and while I may steer clear of the escargot for safety concerns, when it comes to indulging in plenty of sake, delicious rolls, and heaps of rice and sashimi, this place is top-notch. The youthful vibe, upbeat dance music, and abundance of sake keep drawing me back.",
    "We love everything we've tried so far, especially the Backyard Bowl. The portion sizes are generous and the ingredients are high-quality. Despite the crowd, the reasonable prices make it worth the wait.",
    "The service was acceptable, although it was somewhat intriguing due to the newness of the staff member. The food presentation was impressive; however, an enhancement could be made by including more rice or potato salad with the gumbo. The Sprite was flat, but it was not really necessary for the meal.",
    "This pancake place is decent, but it can be chaotic when it's busy. The pancakes are tasty but very sweet. The prices are reasonable, and they serve breakfast all day. Overall, it's a good option, but not extraordinary.",
    "AMAZING finds and EXCEPTIONAL staff! Absolutely IN LOVE with our discoveries and will WITHOUT A DOUBT return!!!",
    "We have been visiting this place since I was young. The staff has seen me and my children grow up. They are friendly, prompt, and provide excellent service. Yoli and Frank are outstanding employees. The food is fantastic! I particularly enjoy their shredded beef burrito and cheese crisp. Their Mexican dishes are truly authentic.",
    "The dine-in experience merits 2 stars, marred by unsatisfactory service and underwhelming ambiance. The cuisine, while acceptable, might warrant 3 stars if opted for takeout. Specifically, the lamb kebab I ordered proved adequate, albeit lacking in flavor enhancements such as sauces or garnishes.",
    "The premier Middle Eastern establishment in this vicinity! Exceptional and unwavering culinary offerings! Successfully pleases the palate!",
    "Oh man, I can't believe someone only gave this place one star! Let me tell ya, they have the absolute BEST cannoli in the city. Forget about Termini's, it's nowhere as good, and Isgro's is just too overhyped. My go-to spot for cannoli is Potito's, no questions asked. I always go there every Christmas Eve, and you can bet I'll keep going for the rest of my life. This year, I waited in line for TWO HOURS at Isgro's for tiramisu, but at Potito's, I just walked in and grabbed my bambino cannoli-stuffed cannoli. It's seriously as delicious as it sounds, believe me.",
    "I absolutely love this small, cozy restaurant that serves delicious and authentic Mexican food. Having grown up in Texas, I've had my fair share of Mexican meals at home, and I'm constantly on the lookout for good Mexican restaurants. El Limon in Pennsylvania is hands down the best I've ever been to! Their sopes, tostadas, enchiladas, fajitas, burritos, and fish tacos are all amazing and reasonably priced. The staff is friendly and attentive. The highlights for me are their homemade tamales and complimentary margaritas. I highly recommend bringing your whole family for a fantastic Mexican dining experience! ¡Ole!",
    "I rate this joint 4 stars as they have potential for 5 stars once they improve. The food quality is really good, with highlights being the Quaker (Chicken version), fries, onion rings, Spanakopita, Baklava, Signature Salad, and the (turkey) Greek Burger. The pizza could be better. With some improvements and maintaining high standards, this place is worth returning to.",
    "Planet Fitness is given four stars mainly because it operates 24 hours a day. It is considered the best bang for your buck in terms of affordability. The gym has a tanning bed, massage chairs, and a sculpt machine, all available for just $20 a month. Although it lacks motivation for bodybuilders as they are not frequent visitors, mostly attracting larger individuals, there is no discrimination intended. Despite the $9.99 plan which excludes the use of massage amenities and the inability to bring friends, all the staff members are polite and helpful.",
    "I was extremely let down when we arrived to eat at 2:15 on Saturday, only to be informed that the kitchen had already closed at 2. Despite their website stating \"Sat & Sun all day,\" it claims they are open until 5. I have reservations about establishments that are unable to handle basic details such as accurately reflecting their hours online. This lack of attention to detail raises doubts for me about their overall quality standards and attention to even minor aspects.",
    "These individuals consistently perform high-quality work within the agreed timeframe and offer a warranty for their services. I highly recommend them!",
    "Dine at this establishment a minimum of twice weekly. The servers consistently exhibit friendliness, and the cuisine is exceptional. I consistently depart satisfied and satiated.",
    "The newly renovated Carrow's Restaurant on Plumb and Kietzke is a delightful discovery. Its charming redwood beams and facades saved it from the wrecking ball. The cuisine was exceptional. My wife savored the tri-tip salad, featuring greens drizzled with a balsamic vinaigrette and complemented by four generous slices of medium-rare tri-tip and delectable potato \"croutons\" – crispy bits of heaven. I opted for the tri-tip and chicken combo, with sides of fresh corn salad and potato salad. The meal was so satisfying that we indulged in dessert – a rarity for me. The dessert options included lemon meringue, mud pie, apple pie, and ice cream. We delighted in the lemon meringue, featuring delicious meringue topping. The prices were very reasonable considering the high quality of food and overall experience. We have already recommended this gem to our local family and friends and look forward to returning soon. Impressive work by the team at Carrow's!",
    "Rebecca may not have been my Doula during childbirth, but she was a nurturing presence in our lives as the nanny to our firstborn daughter. As I navigated the challenges of pregnancy with our second child, Rebecca's advice and insights resonated deeply with me. Her candid yet compassionate nature made our conversations both comforting and enlightening. Her passion for supporting laboring women as a Doula shines through, and she approaches this role with grace and admiration. I wholeheartedly believe that Rebecca would be a valuable asset to your support team.",
    "I recently had my car tinted by Orange Tint and Tune and received exceptional service. They provide a car pick-up service for customers living within a 4-mile radius, which is incredibly convenient. My technician, Carlos, thoroughly explained all tint options and adjusted the grade to match the specific look I desired. This level of customer service truly warrants a 5-star rating. Not only was the receptionist delightful, but owner Dustin also personally followed up to ensure my satisfaction with the service.",
    "I spent three nights here for business purposes. The hotel is conveniently located near the airport, yet it's surprisingly quiet. The rooms are typical TownePlace Suite rooms equipped with a refrigerator, stove, and other amenities. The hotel is situated in a peaceful area with a mix of nearby hotels and office buildings. It's approximately a 20-minute drive to the downtown or university area and about 5-10 minutes away from the Pima Air Museum. While there aren't many dining options close by, there are a few fast food places and a delightful sandwich shop called Baggins within walking distance. The hotel staff was exceptionally friendly and accommodating. The breakfast offered is a standard continental spread with a few hot choices, and they also host a reception on weekday evenings. However, the food and beverages tend to run out quickly, so it's advisable to arrive early. Despite this, you could still consider it as an option for dinner. My only issue was that the supplies ran low shortly after the event started, leaving few soft drinks (no diet) available when I arrived 45 minutes into it. They could enhance the experience by keeping the refreshments well-stocked throughout the duration. Nonetheless, the rooms are pleasant, the beds are cozy, and the area is secure.",
    "We were diverted to Tampa and decided to drive to Orlando, stopping to eat at a local gem recommended by Yelp. They grill their steaks over oak and citrus wood for a delicious smoky flavor, a rare find. Our group enjoyed Tampa strip and ribeye steaks with sides of veggies and sweet potatoes. The reasonably priced wines and excellent service from Lisa made for a delightful experience. Definitely bookmarking this spot for a return visit!",
    "The owner of this location (and two others) reached out to me after my review. We had a great conversation, and I was impressed with his business approach. I revisited Saladworks twice and the service had greatly improved. The new summer salads are delicious!",
    "This is, without a doubt, the best deli in the entire United States! With an array of exciting options, choosing can be difficult. The Muffalata is a massive sandwich that can easily feed four, and it is incredibly delicious. For a lively experience, visit on Saturday or Thursday evenings when they feature live music. The daily specials are consistently excellent, and there is a variety of sides to select from, including mouthwatering chili, potato salad, and, of course, chips. Don't wait - visit now for a memorable dining experience!",
    "During our cross-country journey, my father and I visited Saguaro National Park as one of our initial stops. We had the pleasure of partaking in a guided tour led by Park Ranger Carolyn, whose exceptional passion and enthusiasm for her saguaro studies was evident throughout. Her extensive knowledge further enriched our experience, making both the tour and our interaction with Carolyn highly recommended.",
    "Ventured here following my spouse's return with a batch of their zesty lemon pepper wings. This joint offers an array of delectable flavors, spanning from the classics (like lemon pepper and mild) to unique New Orleans creations (such as yaka mein and noonie bird). Let's not forget about their beverages; the watermelon option is downright heavenly. The secret recipe is a mystery, but it's downright divine. While the location may not be the most upscale, the establishment is endeavoring to enrich the local community. Nestled in close proximity to the daiquiri spot, the area is surprisingly vibrant during daylight hours. I'd exercise caution about visiting solo at night, though. Be sure to give this spot a chance; you might even bump into Skip!",
    "Returning to my visit to the establishment known as Tom Jones, it is time for me to provide an updated appraisal. Upon my recent visit, I observed the absence of the peculiar ATM machine that limited cash withdrawals only for check applications. This machine is no longer present, as it used to be positioned near the restroom facilities. However, the trusty payphone still remains in that spot, a feature that I have always appreciated. Notably, there are now multiple ATM machines located at the front entrance for convenience.\n\nThe price of the renowned blue ribbon special has now been adjusted to $3.79. Despite this slight increase, it remains a worthwhile deal as it encompasses an array of items, including pancakes, 2 eggs, toast, sausage, bacon, juice, and coffee. During this visit, I dined with my children, and it was my daughter's preferred choice to visit Tom Jones, as she expresses a great fondness for the place. Our orders varied, encompassing blue ribbons, french toast, chicken dishes, club sandwiches, and baked potatoes, ensuring that each of us received our desired meal.\n\nThe ambiance of the restaurant was notably clear of any lingering smoke odors, and I must emphasize that I found it to be impeccably clean. The vibrant orange booths added a touch of nostalgia, evoking a sense of stepping back in time, further complemented by the presence of the classic payphone. The service at Tom Jones continues to be prompt and efficient, with each visit being greeted by a different yet capable waitress. The turnover of staff is impressive, indicating a diligent management team that stays on top of things and ensures a smooth operation.\n\nConsidering the significance of Tom Jones to my daughter, who holds it in high regard, I am inclined to elevate my rating from 4 stars to a perfect 5-star rating.",
    "I am an amateur athlete and first met Dr. Ferrel while playing softball. He witnessed my severe injury during a game and promptly provided treatment on the field by relocating my ankle. Following this, he advised me to visit his office for further treatment. Despite expressing my financial constraints as a single mother on a teacher's salary, I sought medical attention elsewhere. The physician I consulted predicted a lengthy recovery period before I could resume playing. Feeling disheartened, I eventually returned to Dr. Ferrel for help. True to his word, he not only treated me effectively but also facilitated a swift recovery within weeks instead of months. Through the years, Dr. Ferrel consistently achieved remarkable results in each of our sessions, solidifying his place as my hero.",
    "Attending their shows is always a delightful experience, offering a captivating and laid-back atmosphere. For an enjoyable evening with delicious fare at reasonable prices, this establishment is the perfect destination.",
    "I absolutely love In-N-Out! There's this irresistible craving for In-N-Out that hits you just right sometimes! What can I say? 4 patties, animal style, bro! Let's go! 🍔🎉",
    "Cindy's is the best! Authentic food, fresh ingredients, and excellent service. A must-try for Mexican cuisine lovers.",
    "I've been eager to try Trust Me BBQ for over a year now. However, when I finally visited about 3 months ago, I waited in line for 10 minutes without service and ended up leaving. Despite this initial setback, I decided to give it another chance after reading reviews just to see what all the hype was about. The food turned out to be hit or miss, but the service was so poor that I doubt I'll be back. The person behind the counter showed no interest or friendliness, making me feel as though I was dealing with a vending machine. Even when we managed to place our order, he didn't pay attention and got the sides wrong, requiring us to correct him as he served us. I've decided I'll stick with Down to the Bone BBQ from now on. The pros were that the BBQ sauce was delicious, the macaroni salad was unique, and the pulled pork was moist. On the flip side, the chicken was as dry as a sheet of paper and essentially inedible even when paired with the BBQ sauce. The mac & cheese seemed like it had been sitting in a pan on the steam table for 2-3 days, and the collard greens lacked flavor.",
    "During my week-long stay in town, I stumbled upon this charming hidden gem. The pa nang chicken exceeded my expectations with its excellent flavor. Opting for a one-star spicy level, my dish arrived promptly. I will be sure to visit again in the future.",
    "This establishment skillfully integrates a variety of flavors from diverse ethnicities and culinary traditions to create unique and enticing recipes. While not explicitly marketed as a \"Mexican\" venue, it excels in crafting delectable margaritas and tequila-based beverages. Additionally, a newly opened wine bar adjacent to the main location offers a selection of specialty bottles and accommodates overflow patrons. Highly recommended are the on the rocks margaritas and house-made white or red sangria, making a visit to this restaurant a rewarding experience.",
    "This charming donut bakery is situated in one of Hermitage's oldest shopping centers, where Yeu, the owner, creates a delightful array of treats. Beyond the common popular donuts, he offers unique specialties like bacon-topped donuts, apple fritters, pigs in a blanket, breakfast pastries, kolaches, and the infamous doughssants – a scrumptious fusion of a donut and croissant. Priced at just $1.99 each, the doughssants are a steal, with regular donuts available for around $0.60 each. These sweet treats make the perfect gift for my children's school teachers, who are always delighted by them. And don't forget to enjoy a cup of coffee while you're here!",
    "We have thoroughly enjoyed attending various events, such as concerts, basketball games, and others, all of which have been a lot of fun. The local favorites served at these events are delicious as well.",
    "Great food! We tried three appetizers and five main dishes, and they were all fantastic. The prices are reasonable and the service is good. I would definitely come back many times!",
    "The service here has gotten worse. We used to come here all the time but now we go somewhere else. They've been really slow and keep forgetting about us.",
    "This was the worst chicken and rice plate I've ever had. I asked for no sauce on the chicken to keep it healthy, but when I got to my car, the bag was full of oil that had leaked out of the container. The dish was swimming in 5-7 tablespoons of oil, which was not what I expected or wanted to eat. It was really disappointing, especially since their slogan includes the word \"healthy.\" What a joke.",
    "Great experience purchasing a washer and dryer from Sears for my new home. Excellent selection, knowledgeable salespeople, timely delivery, and beyond expected service. Highly recommend!",
    "The food at this place is absolutely amazing! Not only is the service quick, but the staff is incredibly friendly as well. Every time I visit, I'm greeted with such warmth and hospitality when ordering.",
    "I had the opportunity to sample them at last. Their impressive craftsmanship was apparent in the remodel. I thoroughly enjoyed the mushroom cheese steak.",
    "The espresso here is absolutely phenomenal - it's truly the best! This is without a doubt my go-to spot for an amazing Americano. The staff is incredibly kind and welcoming, and the vibes are just so chill and relaxed. Plus, they offer unlimited WiFi access, so you can stay connected easily. While there are no power outlets available, the bathrooms and the whole place are consistently spotless - a total win!",
    "I decided to check out this place after hearing all the hype about their high ratings. However, the entire experience left much to be desired. Their website was pretty useless in terms of figuring out the menu beforehand. You had to select a location out of three options and then scroll all the way down to see brief, unhelpful descriptions with no prices listed. It was just a list like this: Roast Beef, Roast Beef Combo, Roast Pork, Roast Pork Combo, Baked Ham, Baked Ham Combo, Roast Turkey, Roast Turkey Combo, Broccoli Rabe, Broccoli Rabe Combo. There was no explanation of what a combo entailed (it's just cheese, in case you're wondering). Ironically, the table place card had more detailed descriptions than the website.\n\nUpon walking in, I noticed that the place leaned more towards being a bar than a restaurant, which was fine, but there were still tables. Not being able to decide, I opted for the roast beef and roast pork combos since they were reasonably priced at $6.85 each. The sandwiches arrived quickly, but the roast beef was cold while the roast pork was hot. It was puzzling how they could have such a temperature difference when served simultaneously; clearly, one had been sitting around. I asked for the roast beef to be reheated while I finished the roast pork, and although it was warmer upon return, it still felt a bit cold compared to the other sandwich. The waitress offered to replace it, but as I was pressed for time, I declined. \n\nThe sandwiches were disappointingly sparse on meat, but compensated for this by drowning them in excessive gravy, which made them unnecessarily messy and caused the bread to fall apart. The menu place card mentioned a \"wet meat\" option with less gravy, and I highly recommend choosing this to avoid overpowering the taste of the meat and maintaining the sandwich's structure.",
    "I ordered food to go from Village Whiskey, so I can't give a review of the restaurant itself. The Whiskey Burger costs $26 and is delicious if you like a greasy burger. It is very tender with great bacon and is quite large. I recommend it if you don't mind the high price. The Duck Fat fries are also very tasty.",
    "Spent $80 on a feast for the family, and it was absolutely worth it! The food was piping hot, and the orange chicken was hands down the best I've had in a long time. From now on, this will be our go-to spot for delicious Asian cuisine!",
    "I usually do my laundry at my boyfriend's place, but with family guests bringing in a lot of towels, sheets, and comforters, I needed to find a safe, clean, and welcoming laundromat. I was relieved to discover this facility, which is immaculate, well-lit, and staffed by incredibly friendly and helpful employees. The laundry and dryer worked impressively quickly, allowing me to finish 4 oversized loads (equivalent to about 8 regular loads) in under 2 hours! The amenities were top-notch, including security cameras, flat screen TVs, magazines, Wi-Fi, clean restrooms, and vending machines. This laundromat provides a fantastic environment for getting laundry done, offering plenty of machines without being overcrowded. I am thrilled to have found this gem. Thank you, LAUNDROMAT!",
    "We stopped by for a late-night dinner last night and, man, the prices were pretty steep. To save some money, both couples decided to share a plate (our server seemed a bit annoyed). The food was decent, but honestly, it wasn't worth the high prices. I have to give it to them though, the garlic bread they served before the meal was absolutely delicious! I could have easily filled up on just that. Overall, I don't think I'd go back there personally. Maybe it was just an off night, but there are so many other great dining options in the St. Louis area, so much competition!",
    "I stopped by a bustling restaurant to enjoy a delicious Haven burger during the Seahawks/Saints game today. The place was crowded, and I had to sit near the door. The burger I ordered was fantastic, and the restaurant quickly became busier as more people arrived. I had to navigate through a busy crowd to leave the place, indicating that it's a popular spot. I plan to revisit the Haven, perhaps for a less busy lunch on a Tuesday.",
    "I've only tried the vermicelli bowls because I've never had the Pho here. The vermicelli is a good size and the price is fair. If you live in the Alberta Ave neighborhood, this place is conveniently located and my orders are always ready in just 15 minutes - even on a Friday night.",
    "I tried the Chicken Marsala on the waiter's recommendation, but I was disappointed. The chicken was tough and dry, and the pasta was undercooked and clumped together with no flavor. My friend ordered the lasagne but didn't enjoy it; it was bland with only a thin layer of pasta. The service was lacking too - they cleared my other friend's plate while she was in the restroom, even though she wasn't finished. On the plus side, the atmosphere was great with live music, and I had a good time dancing with my husband. However, the food was terrible for the high price.",
    "This place is fantastic! It has a beautiful setting and is conveniently located near the Broad Street line with lots of street parking available. You can bring your own drinks. I've visited twice and loved everything I tried. My favorite dishes were the chaats, beef short ribs, lamb vindaloo, beet salad, breads/pickles, and chai. We always enjoyed sharing the chocolate cake for dessert, which was a hit with everyone. You can even pick up some beer to go from the nearby bar. We're definitely planning to return.",
    "My favorite restaurant serves delicious ceviche. The atmosphere is fun, and the service, especially from our server Alex, is friendly, attentive, and thoughtful.",
    "This store is fantastic! Everyone loves it! The salad bar offers fresh options, and they have a variety of ethnic foods to explore. Enjoy!",
    "Review: I ordered a delicious Mediterranean chicken shawarma, which had a good flavor and a generous amount of chicken in the pita. The food was prepared quickly and was ready for me when I arrived, showcasing good service. I definitely plan to revisit the next time I am in the area.",
    "I find this establishment to be quite delightful. The culinary offerings are of high quality, and the ambiance and service provided by the staff are truly pleasant. I highly recommend this dining option for individuals who follow both vegetarian and non-vegetarian diets.",
    "The service was a bit slow to start, but once we were in the swing of things, I was absolutely thrilled! The gumbo was simply amazing, and I couldn't get enough of the chicken & waffles. The staff was super friendly, and the location on Bourbon St was perfect for some great people watching!",
    "Earl's airport grab-and-go eateries offer a solid selection of sandwich choices, from turkey and tuna to the enticing Hawaiian. Today, the aroma of roast beef beckoned to me, sealing my decision. The sandwich arrived, brimming with a generous portion of tender beef, cooked to perfection and accompanied by cheddar cheese and a delectable horseradish sauce. For me, no need for lettuce or tomatoes; it's a culinary masterpiece as it stands. Conveniently located between the security checkpoint and the top of the D gates (just a stone's throw from the Delta SkyClub!), it's a quick and hassle-free option to enjoy at your gate or on the plane. Delicious!",
    "What an amazing experience! The food was outstanding, the service was exceptional, and the staff were very welcoming. The cheese curds appetizer with red pepper jelly was a hit, and both the fish tacos and beer brat for dinner were delicious. The portion sizes were generous, and the prices were reasonable. Our server was attentive and knowledgeable, and the manager checked in to make sure we were happy.\n\nI mentioned to the manager that I had discovered a new favorite spot and he told us about their game day specials and weekend brunch. As we left, the staff bid us farewell and offered us root beer candies. I'm definitely planning to return!",
    "I dropped by to have dinner and a drink, and I was very satisfied with my experience! Normally, I don't order burgers when eating out because I can easily make them at home. However, after trying the burger here, I'll have a tough time not ordering it again. In addition to the delicious food, they offer a good selection of beers, and the friendly wait staff and bartenders made me feel welcome. My meal was cooked exactly as I requested and was served promptly. The restaurant has a pleasant ambiance, and the restrooms were well-maintained. Overall, I left feeling very pleased with my visit."
