    "If you decide to eat here, just be aware it is going to take about 2 hours from beginning to end. We have tried it multiple times, because I want to like it! I have been to it's other locations in NJ and never had a bad experience.   The food is good, but it takes a very long time to come out. The waitstaff is very young, but usually pleasant. We have just had too many experiences where we spent way too long waiting. We usually opt for another diner or restaurant on the weekends, in order to be done quicker.",
    "I've taken a lot of spin classes over the years, and nothing compares to the classes at Body Cycle. From the nice, clean space and amazing bikes, to the welcoming and motivating instructors, every class is a top notch work out.  For anyone who struggles to fit workouts in, the online scheduling system makes it easy to plan ahead (and there's no need to line up way in advanced like many gyms make you do).  There is no way I can write this review without giving Russell, the owner of Body Cycle, a shout out. Russell's passion for fitness and cycling is so evident, as is his desire for all of his clients to succeed. He is always dropping in to classes to check in/provide encouragement, and is open to ideas and recommendations from anyone. Russell always wears a smile on his face, even when he's kicking your butt in class!",
    "Family diner. Had the buffet. Eclectic assortment: a large chicken leg, fried jalapeño, tamale, two rolled grape leaves, fresh melon. All good. Lots of Mexican choices there. Also has a menu with breakfast served all day long. Friendly, attentive staff. Good place for a casual relaxed meal with no expectations. Next to the Clarion Hotel.",
    "Wow!  Yummy, different,  delicious.   Our favorite is the lamb curry and korma.  With 10 different kinds of naan!!!  Don't let the outside deter you (because we almost changed our minds)...go in and try something new!   You'll be glad you did!",
    "Cute interior and owner (?) gave us tour of upcoming patio/rooftop area which will be great on beautiful days like today. Cheese curds were very good and very filling. Really like that sandwiches come w salad, esp after eating too many curds! Had the onion, gruyere, tomato sandwich. Wasn't too much cheese which I liked. Needed something else...pepper jelly maybe. Would like to see more menu options added such as salads w fun cheeses. Lots of beer and wine as well as limited cocktails. Next time I will try one of the draft wines.",
    "I am a long term frequent customer of this establishment. I just went in to order take out (3 apps) and was told they're too busy to do it. Really? The place is maybe half full at best. Does your dick reach your ass? Yes? Go fuck yourself! I'm a frequent customer AND great tipper. Glad that Kanella just opened. NEVER going back to dmitris!",
    "Loved this tour! I grabbed a groupon and the price was great. It was the perfect way to explore New Orleans for someone who'd never been there before and didn't know a lot about the history of the city. Our tour guide had tons of interesting tidbits about the city, and I really enjoyed the experience. Highly recommended tour. I actually thought we were just going to tour through the cemetery, but she took us around the French Quarter for the first hour, and the cemetery for the second half of the tour. You'll meet up in front of a grocery store (seems strange at first, but it's not terribly hard to find, and it'll give you a chance to get some water), and you'll stop at a visitor center part way through the tour for a bathroom break if needed. This tour was one of my favorite parts of my trip!",
    "Amazingly amazing wings and homemade bleu cheese. Had the ribeye: tender, perfectly prepared, delicious. Nice selection of craft beers. Would DEFINITELY recommend checking out this hidden gem.",
    "This easter instead of going to Lopez Lake we went to Los Padres National Forest which is really pretty but if you go to white rock the staff needs to cut down all the dead grass that invades the rock and the water. I would wish the staff would also clean or get rid of the dead grass that's also living by the water. The water is really green and dirty. Los padres national forest staff need to work hard to maintain this forest looking pretty and not like a dumpster. Even Cachuma lake looks like they put a bit more effort.",
    "Had a party of 6 here for hibachi. Our waitress brought our separate sushi orders on one plate so we couldn't really tell who's was who's and forgot several items on an order. I understand making mistakes but the restaraunt was really quiet so we were kind of surprised. Usually hibachi is a fun lively experience and our  cook  said maybe three words, but he cooked very well his name was Francisco. Service was fishy, food was pretty good, and im hoping it was just an off night here. But for the money I wouldn't go back.",
    "My experience with Shalimar was nothing but wonderful.  I wanted to get my engagement ring sized and was told over the phone that it could probably be done within the day.  When I brought it by, the team confirmed that the jeweler would be able to accommodate my same-day request and that it would be around $40 (simple band, decrease by three full sizes). I checked my size one more time, confirmed, and left to let them do their thing. When I came to pick up later that afternoon, the ring was too small. It's very important to note that Shalimar sized the ring perfectly, but that I made a mistake and should've gone up a half-size. The Shalimar group were completely understanding and accommodating, even resizing my ring back up and getting it back to me within an hour at no charge! Even though it was my mistake! The associates' attitudes in dealing with what was a pretty embarrassing situation instantly earned my satisfaction and loyalty as a customer. Very grateful for such a wonderful experience.",
    "Locals recommended Milktooth, and it's an amazing jewel of Indianapolis. I'm glade I had the chance to experience this.",
    "Love going here for happy hour or dinner!  Great patio with fans to beat the StL heat!   Also...very accomodating at this location.  I like the Veal Milanese but with mixed greens instead of pasta!  they'll modify the menu to suit your taste!",
    "Good food--loved the gnocchi with marinara the baked eggplant appetizer was very good too  The service was very slow, but despite this, I'd go back, the food is just that good",
    "The bun makes the Sonoran Dog. It's like a snuggie for the pup. A first, it seems ridiculous and almost like it's going to be too much, exactly like everyone's favorite blanket with sleeves. Too much softness, too much smush, too indulgent.  Wrong. It's warm, soft, chewy, fragrant, and it succeeds where other famed Sonoran Dogs fail.   The hot dog itself is flavorful, but I would prefer that it or the bacon have a little more bite or snap to better hold their own against the dominant mustard and onions.   I'm with the masses on the carne asada caramelo. Excellent tortilla, salty, melty cheese, and great carne.   Super cheap and you can drive through.",
    "Great place for breakfast! I had the waffle, which was fluffy and perfect, and home fries which were nice and smashed and crunchy. Friendly waitstaff. Will definitely be back!",
    "Tremendous service (Big shout out to Douglas) that complemented the delicious food. Pretty expensive establishment (40-50$ avg for your main course), but its definitely backs that up with an atmosphere that's comparable with any of the top tier restaurants across the country.",
    "The hubby and I have been here on multiple occasions and we have loved every part of the meal, every single time. Everyone from the servers to the bartender is very knowledgable about the menu and was able to immediately recommend items I could eat as-is, substitute or delete to make something safe for this Celiac girl to eat. The wine and cocktail menus are spot on. The food divine.  My only wish is that they would have a gluten-free dessert, we've always had to go elsewhere for something sweet. But that is not a big deal and I still want to go here time and time again.",
    "I go to blow bar to get my brows done by natalie (brow specialist) which i highly recommend she is great does a great job on my eyebrows! But then i got a blow by victoria!! Wow i was impress i have thin, straight, dead hair and she left me with the biggest volume ive ever had!!! Tried another girl but didnt like it as much so victoria will be my girl for ever; very beautiful clean place!!!",
    "My absolute favorite cafe in the city. Their black and white latte is probably the best I've ever had (not too sweet and just the right amount of foam), soups are always really good (even for non-soup people) and there's just a lot of space to do work. The noise level is perfect, the music is at a perfect level, and I always enjoy when patrons bring their dogs. I'll keep giving them my business for as long as I can.",
    "HOLY SMOKES!  actual pumpkin pie mixed in with the frozen custard......are you kidding me? Why hasn't this become a huge sweep the nation treat.   The best part was the chunks of pie crust. Like finding a diamond inside another diamond. Super yummy.",
    "Upland is a brewery based out of Bloomington, Indiana that has become popular enough to open up a couple additional locations in central Indiana.  All of their beers are very good, and I am also a fan of their burgers and tenderloins.  Therefore, I was excited to try their pizza, but I don't think it ended up being on par with these other items.  My margherita pizza had a cracker-like crust and was pretty light overall.  The cheese was good, but none of the other toppings added much flavor.  There was no red sauce as is typical for a true margherita pizza.  My opinion is that Upland's pizza might serve as a nice appetizer for a group, but I'll be sticking with their burgers or tenderloins as my meal of choice on future visits.",
    "I thoroughly enjoyed the show.  Chill way to spend a Friday night.",
    "Yes, this is the only sushi place in town. However, it is great when you're craving sushi and don't have time to go somewhere else. The salmon is probably the best fish they have, so we always order salmon. We also love their spicy edamame, tempura, ocean salad, and cabbage salad. Service has always been friendly and quick!",
    "I was really between 3 and 4 stars for this one. I LOVE the 96th street Naked Tchopstix so I was very excited to see this one which is closer to my house. The vibe is totally different as this is geared more to take out although they do have a decent size dining area. You order at the counter and they deliver it. My daughter and I tried the sushi bowl. You pick up a piece of paper and  select from a choice of proteins, vegetables, rice and toppings. I like the fact that it is on paper and you don't have to guess what things are or have to shout over the counter to tell the server what you want. The sushi bowl was good but not wonderful. The choices particularly of the vegetables seemed a little too limiting and I felt I had more rice than other food items. The sauces were tasty. My husband ordered the Maui roll which is my favorite roll at the 96th street location and this just was not up that standard. It was good but the quality and consistently was not as good as at 96th street. I would go back though and I think a lot of people would be happy with the sushi bowls. I do want to make a comment about the low reviews that people have given the place because of service. People - it is a sushi place - it isn't McDonalds- so it will be a bit slower. You are not going to order and get out of there in five minutes even though it is called express. As a healthy alternative to fast food in the area, it is worth the wait. Oh and try the bubble tea. I had the strawberry and it was quite yummy. Next time I am going to try the vanilla chai.",
    "Went for lunch. Beef brisket sandwich was awesome.   So juicy and tender.    Pulled pork was was just as good!",
    "Best thai food in the area.  Everything was authentic and delicious.  Will definitely be back again and again.",
    "Service was crappy, and food was mediocre.  I wish I would have picked some other place for my last dinner in town.",
    "I recently had dinner here with my wife over the weekend and could not have been more pleased!   Our meal was excellent! My wife and I were astounded by how quickly our food came out! Everything tasted fresh and homemade which we both appreciated.   The only problem was trying to pick something from the menu as there were too many delicious sounding items to choose from. We will definitely be returning to try more items! Can't wait to see what the next chef specials will be!",
    "I at least have to give this restaurant two stars due to the decent food. But while on a dinner meeting and after spending $100 on entrées and appetizers, I had to flag down the assistant cook, (the guy in bright red baggy pants watching TV), to see if I could get more avocado for my tuna entrée.  He made it very apparent and direct that he could not help me with that situation and I would have to flag down my  waitress so she could bill me for the four dollar avocado.",
    "First time there and it was excellent!!! It feels like your are entering someone's home. The waiters there funny and nice. The food come out very quickly and it is phenomenal!!! Definitely will be going back to this place.",
    "Great burgers,fries and salad!  Burgers have a hint of salt and pepper flavor.  This location is very quaint. They only have outdoor seating  Friendly staff.  Street parking as well as parking lot in the back.",
    "Great staff always helps and always nice. Always clean and huge store size. Stays stocked with everything you need. The staff always helps make my custom breakfast bagel",
    "Took my vehicle here for some work a few years ago for a manufacturer recall. Problem went away and then started hearing another noise which I thought was related, but turned out was a completely different issue. Kevin and his mechanic lifted my car right up and fixed the issue FREE OF CHARGE even though I told them I'd pay. Outstanding individuals for doing that. Highly recommend!",
    "After my ROTD  yesterday of a different Sweet CeCe's location, I realized that I had never reviewed my local source!  Anyway, I love the product.  Love love love.  And I usually like their selection of toppings - good mix between healthy and not-so-healthy.  Sometimes the girls working there aren't really paying attention or are nowhere to be found.  Sometimes you have to remind them of their deals (like $5 Friday).  But I can't give it less than 4 stars because I just love it so much.",
    "What a great addition to the Funk Zone!  Grab a bite, grab some tastings, life is good. Right next door to the Santa Barbara Wine Collective, in fact it actually shares the same tables.  We had a fabulous savory croissant.",
    "Nice relaxing place to get a massage! Same day appointments are easy to come by! I have never been disappointed with any therapist I have had at the Center!",
    "We checked in around 2:30 pm.  Check-in was quick and easy with complimentary valet parking (always appreciated).  The Peppermill is huge and reminded us of the Caesars Palace in Las Vegas.  They have around eight restaurants on site offering almost any type of food you could want.  The casino area is huge, rivaling almost anything you could find in Las Vegas.  One thing we noticed is that many of the slot machines were noted as being penny machines, but when you actually started to play them you realized they had minimum bets of anywhere from 30 cents to $5.  Talk about false advertising!  We were in the Tuscany Tower on the 12th floor.  Our room had a nice view of the huge pool area.  Our room was large and featured free WiFi (likewise always appreciated), a huge bathroom area with large shower (with two shower heads), TV, a large jetted bathtub and a phone next to the commode.  There were dual sinks and lots of counter space.  Plenty of towels were supplied.  The roomy main area had a king bed with night stands, closet, TV, mini fridge, dresser with two drawers, a safe, table for computer or writing, complimentary bottles of water, and three nicely upholstered chairs and table.  The thermostat did a good job controlling the temperature and keeping it comfortable.  Staff were all courteous and helpful.  A very nice place and we enjoyed our stay.",
    "My boyfriend and I tried this deli for the first time today. I had a turkey, avocado & bacon panini and he ha a buffalo chicken wrap. We will definitely be returning. The wait for food wasn't too long, which is always appreciated during lunch hour. There was SO much to choose from. They have salads, soup, macaroni, sandwiches and hot food. I love a deli that has many options to choose from!",
    "Amazing biscuits and (fill in the blank). Great cocktails too. Highly recommended. A bit busy though.",
    "Food was good- atmosphere/decor is like a fishing lodge- menu is someplace between outback & bonefish. Went on a Groupon & all 3 of our meals & calamari appetizer that we ordered were cooked perfectly- we will def be back.",
    "Straight to the point, it's cheap, it tastes and feels cheap  The good: price, location, dessert (edible food items are: baked chicken, fried chicken, mashed potatoes, Salad bar lol, meat and cheese bar, ravioli, pizza) also our waitress was bomb af  The meh: behind counter meat slicing station, shrimp (not even deveined), Mexican station  The bad: breakfast -worst eggs ever, actually worst, eggs. Le Benedict can't even cut through ham or English muffin (tried on all 3 occasions), steak, shrimp again, hell breaded items can't even, don't even. Decor it's the 1970 nightmare you can imagine  Tried 3 times and failed",
    "The only reason I didn't give this restaurant a 5 star rating, is because of one single pretentious waiter. As a 4 night guest at Hotel Palomar, the location of the restaurant is an obvious plus. The first night of my stay, I met a coworker in the restaurant for a cocktail. When we arrived, the host staff were busy and not available, so we just walked in. The restaurant was not too busy, so we just looked at a small table next to the bar and proceeded to take a seat. A waiter came by and I quickly asked if we could have a seat, before sitting down and told him we'd only be having cocktails. He stumbled on his reply, and in an irritated/in-convinced tone, told me \"I guess it would be fine\" and basically just kept walking mid sentence. My guest and I brushed it off, and started having a conversation while looking at the drink menu. To make a long story short, he was distant and we both got the \"couldn't be bothered\" vibe from him. When it came to the bill, we asked if it could be split due to company transaction policies, and you would have thought asked him for some inconceivable task. We basically spent the rest of our night and elevator ride to our room in shock of the rudeness we had just experienced.   Although that situation left a bad taste in our mouth, and the night before we decided to avoid the restaurant, we decided to grab another cocktail and give this place one more try. After looking around and ensuring \"last nights waiter\" wasn't on shift, we walked over to the bar and started looking over the menu. Instantly, the bartender greeted us with pleasant small talk and made us feel 100% welcome. He asked about our day, recommended cocktails and was a completely genuine person. This guy (I think his name was Ben) is an absolute star! He gave us lessons on Whiskey, described how to make classic cocktails, and was 100% invested in our experience. This is exactly what a bartender at a 4/5 star establishment should be - actually he exceeds that. He was kind, funny, friendly and completely redeemed this restaurant/bar from our terrible experience the night before.  I also ordered room service last night from this restaurant, and it was amazing. The bacon wrapped dates and chocolate cake are to die for! Great restaurant and amazing bartender(s). Too bad one bad egg could have spoiled this experience.",
    "Stopped by after a Sunday morning walk in the park - great food, coffee customer service - love the vibe in here",
    "In a word... \"OVERRATED!\".  The food took forever to come out.  The burger was WAY overcooked (Especially when I ordered it Medium Rare) and the Seafood Jumbalaya was Decent.  Not worth the price.  There are better places to eat in the french quarter.  It was not horrible, but for everything that we had heard about this place, I would have expected much better.",
    "Comfortable bed, good breakfast, fast internet, great location, and low price. Overall I was really impressed with this place. However, if you stay on the top floors you may be waiting up to 15 minutes for an elevator in the morning.",
    "NEVER AGAIN. This is a so called restaurant that does nothing that a restaurant should other than prepare food, because the rest is done by the patron. Want water? Get up and go across the yard to get it. Want a drink, walk up a flight of stairs and pay cash. Want to sit in a dirty yard in dirty lawn chairs, enjoy yourself. The wait staff is mildy helpful in that they bring you your food after you go to the window and pay cash for it...kind of like New Orleans Hamburger and Seafood, but dirty and with live music (which is nice). It's a one in a lifetime experience for me...just once.",
    "If you want to pay for everything a la carte this is the place for you.   Food wasn't terrible not impressive. They brought a basket of chips and some tomato sauce which I asked politely for something spicier and some pico de gallo.  She brought them happily to me and the salsa was much better.  When asked what we would like to drink I asked for a coke and she brought out a bottle which I stated I wanted the fountain drink.  She said \"oh that's only Pepsi\".  Never mentioned that they only had bottle drinks for coke.   We ordered our food which was reasonably priced, asked for sour cream and also to put cheese on the taco.  She let us know cheese was extra.   It was $2.50 extra for another basket of chips.   When I received the bill we paid more for the condiments then the actual food.  Side of sour cream 2.00, pico de gallo 2.50, salsa 2.00, chips 2.50, cheese 1.00 and the bottled coke that we didn't want 5.00.   Just a suggestion...when you order anything make sure to ask if there is an extra charge.",
    "The cafe was extremely cute. We came at 8am and they even had a jazz band playing at that time. I got the breakfast sandwich and it was delicious. I loved how they rolled the egg and put the bacon pieces inside. Great price for a filling breakfast!",
    "On a scale of one to things that are awesome, this place is the bomb.   I was drawn in by the promise of the duckfat frenchfries. Took the boy for his birthday and put our name in, had a drink around the corner while we waited and were given seats at the bar after about 45 minutes.   We were waited on by Keith, the bartender, who was congenial, knowledgeable about his whiskeys and an all-around cool guy. We started with 3 cape may salts (two for me, one for the boy) and tater tots, both of which made me happy.  For dinner, I got Kentucky Fried Quail (stellar, though the succotash was not as exciting as I wanted it to be) and the boy got the 24$ Fois Gras burger, which was incredible. Worth every penny. The duckfat fries were pretty yummy, but not even the best part of the meal. I could've done without the cheese sauce, but as it was on the side I wasn't deterred.  I look forward to coming back here, with everyone I know.",
    "We started with the artichoke dip, big mistake. It was cold and the chips were stale. Mentioned to our waitress, but nothing came of it.  We ordered a large pizza, thin crust which after adding toppings it was a bit pricey for pizza.  Pizza was ok, not great. Except for not being our advocate our server was good.  I have been here before for Cardinals game, it was better then. Will try another venue next time.",
    "It was my fiance's birthday and he decided he wanted a good, laid back Thai restaurant for dinner. Yelp steered us in the Jasmine Rice direction, and it was definitely a good decision. We wanted the summer rolls, which were on the menu, but apparently will not be available until summer, so we settled on the pan-fried dumplings. The flavor was good, but I don't think we'd order them again. We got the green curry fried rice with duck and chicken pad thai. Both of those dishes were great, but the duck stole the show. That was some the of tastiest duck I've ever had. The pad thai was a bit sweet for us, so I think we'd try a different noodle dish when we return. But it was still very good, especially with some chili sauce mixed in. Our service was good, but other people had issues. One table was rushing to get to a show at the Kimmel Center and waited quite a while for their meal (and were going to be late). Another person who got take-out was missing one of their items (but the owner realized it and called him and walked the dish to his house, which was very nice). Overall, good quality Thai! We would definitely go back.",
    "I absolutely love Courtney! She is hands down the best hairstylist I have ever had. The reason I think she is so great is that she knows what will look best on me and over the past year has understood my limits for styles. I always go into the salon and tell her to cut my hair how she thinks will look best, and I always leave blown away at what she does. You know you have a great stylist when you don't have to specify what you want done, but instead they see what needs to be done. Great stylist, great personality and very knowledgeable. I would highly recommend her to anyone who wants to look their best.",
    "I've been to this location many times when I lived in the area and although it is a chain and not exactly sexy, it does the job on many occasions.   If you need an oil change, this place is ok, if you need a state inspection this place does it.   The key is getting there when they are not busy or else you will wait.     Again, nothing fancy here a pep boys is a pep boys but all in all decent stuff.",
    "Replaced 2 old 70s lennox with 2 new ones.  They did a great job and have been runnong for 3 years now.",
    "I love the Brewpub for their variety of dishes.  Nachos, pizza and sandwiches.  Variety of beers to choose from crafted right on sight.    Every time we go, the service is slow.  I think it's just the pace of the restaurant.  It's never a quick beer and a bite of food.  Instead, enjoy the patio and friends, savor that time.    Kid and dog friendly environment.  Also great for your vegetarian and vegan friends.    My go to is a half order of the nachos or fish & chips.    Tried their Pumpkin Seasonal Beer and it's on par with some of my favorite pumpkins.",
    "Farmhouse, rustic, chic.Helpful staff with great ideas to decorate your home. Prices reasonable. Store has items from Joanna Gaines ( Fixer Upper) and much more. Finally a good home store in SB with reasonable prices.",
    "My brother came to visit and we wanted to pick up a six pack of good beers for a night in. Ended up staying and having a few while playing their Nintendo 64 (Super Smash Brothers, which the owner said was donated by fellow patrons). It's a great place with good food and genuinely nice people. Should be a staple in the Northeast.",
    "My go to menu is coconut soup and pad thai with protein. I tried same menu here.  Actually really like their coconut soup. They used enough amount of coconut milk that soup was really creamy and wasn't over powering with herb. I am so used to Americanized thai cuisine that I prefer less herb on my dish except cilantro. Pat thai was great too. Liked the amount of peanut they used, noodle was chewy and perfect and not too sweet. They gave me generous amount of chicken and white meat wasn't dry so I was very happy with my meal.",
    "Excellent service! Great diner food and breakfast is served all day. Came here for lunch- they were busy but very friendly and hospitable. Easy to get to off the 295.",
    "My go-to spot on a Saturday night! I was real bummed that lucys closed, but was pleasantly surprised by this bar just across the street! Their food is better than expected. I always get wings and fries. (be careful of the wtf sauce though) Sometimes it takes a real long time to get the bartenders attention, but the place is usually packed. And if you're lucky the always sunny crew will pop in!",
    "We were a bit weary about trying the Shellfish Company on the Wharf as more often than not, many places like these (see Cannery Row, Monterey) feast on a captive audience and provide sub-standard fare at high prices.  However, emboldened by the perennial good reviews on Yelp, we suppressed our initial observations and went ahead with the trying it out. The place is small, so definitely plan ahead. You will have to wait, so either you know, just do so, or perhaps try to visit outside of peak hours. Luckily, our wait was only about 20 minutes as the dinner rush was just leveling off.  The special was the local rock crab - $25 for 3 lbs of California Rock Crab, salad, and your choice of soup/chowder. After taking a look at a few trays of rock crab being served out, the wife and I both opted for it, as it looked awesome.    The salad/chowder combo was great as you actually received hearty portions of each, so it was a good start. As much as I liked the chowder however, the Shrimp Bisque the wife ordered was amazing, so I would recommend that going forward.   But enough of prattling on about side dishes: the rock crab tasted just as glorious as it looked. Juicy, buttery chunks of white crab meat await you, just a few cracks away. While the rock crab shells are pretty thick, once cracked, they splinter and separate easily, a good sign they are cooked to perfection. The rock crabs provided a great amount of meat for what I felt to be the least amount of work you're going to do for crab, King or otherwise.   We were thoroughly satisfied with our meal and along with the special being an overall great value, devouring the Rock Crab at SBSC turned out to be one of the favorite meals on the trip. I think ordering crab here is a safe proposition indeed.",
    "I LOVE Weaver's Way and really disagree with some of the content in previous reviews. WW is not necessarily meant for convenience shopping. I am a single woman and I find that I have no trouble shopping at the co-op, during peak times or otherwise. I actually find the co-op to be a great place to shop if you live alone because I can get smaller quantities of items than if I shop at the corporate stores like Acme. I also enjoy the work hours - I've worked throughout the store, but most recently, I have been getting in my hours by participating in the membership committee. I wouldn't say that the community is necessarily made up of \"tree huggers\" and \"earth children\", though. The community is made up of a variety of similarly-minded folks from different backgrounds. I enjoy having a place to go to where I can obtain locally grown produce, a place that offers more natural, wholesome, and preservative-free foods than chain stores with prices way below that of Whole Foods. I enjoy interacting with other members and contributing to my local and global community. I don't find the membership fee or the work hours to be prohibitive being a single person vs. a family. I don't think that membership in a co-op is for everyone and, if you aren't single, it's definitely not a solo decision. If you're keen on being committed to the Weaver Way values, you couldn't find a better place to shop. If not, stick to the chain stores or just pay the 10% visitors' fee to pop in once in a while.",
    "Honestly the food doesn't knock my socks off but other people seem to love this place. I go because my husband likes it as for me I'd rather go to a different BBQ spot. I guess it also depends on what you order.",
    "The TV shows are $4.99 and they have commercials! What a cheesy way to make money and a sign of a less than classy hotel, particularly when you pay more than $150 a night.  And there is NO complimentary breakfast, just an overpriced buffet, something even the cheapest hotels in California provide.",
    "I stopped here because it was by the hotel I was staying in. The guys working at the shop were super nice and friendly. I really like the buy one get one deal they do. I also ordered some hot wings and they were pretty good. They had a ton of sauce on them which is awesome. Next time I come back to town I will be sure to stop here for some more pizza!",
    "I've only had the cannolis here but they are awesome! They're freshly filled when ordered and the filling is phenomenal. Not too sweet, it's perfect. If you like cannoli, if you don't think you like cannoli, you should definitely get one from Termini Bros.",
    "Traveling through in our RV, stopped over in Granite City. Found this little gem of a cafe. Upon entering, the staff was very sweet and friendly. This is like home cooking. We ate here twice and all our food choices were fresh, delicious and like we would fix at home. Yum.",
    "After 3 weeks of working in the area I finally found a place off of Magazine that is not overrated. Friendly staff! Y'all know I love Phò so it's pretty damn good!",
    "Our family returned for breakfast again this weekend and the food and service was again impeccable ... Highly recommend",
    "The kayaking tour at the Santa Cruz Island was great.  My husband and I had a wonderful time.  Jen, our tour guide, was helpful and informative.  We had a lot of fun exploring the caves.  We didn't expect much but this tour definitely exceeded our expectation.",
    "Definitely recommend for anyone looking for a delicious meal at a reasonable price. The shrimp and goat cheese crepes are a must have!",
    "After living in the STL area for way over 10 years now, I am both ashamed and remorseful to admit that I ate here for the FIRST time just a few weeks ago. I am ashamed because it's a St. Louis tradition and remorseful because I missed out on it for so..many...years!   This place is amazing. What is not to love! It's a factory where you can get a tour (Friday-Sunday, noon-5pm on the hour), there's a shop, bar, and dining area. They also host many event with live music on the weekends. It's fun to just kind of wander and look around - don't worry, you'll get a chance because there will likely be a wait before you dine. The beer is, of course, amazing. The Hefeweizen is my personal favorite and a great start for anyone who is not a huge beer drinker (like myself). Additionally, the food is homegrown and damn good. I had the pizza (recommendation from my server) and it was really spectacular, though I'm admittedly a pizza connoisseur so I enjoy a good pizza pie more than most probably ;P My date had a bison burger which was also really good.   More fun info: the service is great! I think they tend to hire more funky and alternative people (like tattoo parlor staff) which I support. The quality is what makes this place stand out along with the emphasis on local food and brewery.   It is a little on the pricier side but for all the experience you get and the quality, it is worth it. I will go again and again and you probably should, too!",
    "If I could give it a zero, I would. I order a plain hamburger, and realized they put  bacon in it (which I am allergic to and unable to eat) after two bites. When I went back to the drive-through window to complain (didn't realize the actual restaurant was open--it was almost 2 after all...), the guy took back the burger, said nothing, and disappeared. After 2 minutes of awkwardly making conversation with the next people in line in their car, he came back and rudely told me I had to go inside to get my food. Which I did. And still did not get an apology.  I refuse to go back there after that ordeal, which is a shame, because it's nice to have a variety of places to go to after DT. Guess Freebirds it is!",
    "First time here and they did a great job, very satisfied with the car wash  and the service I received. Thank you",
    "I just started going to Sushi Nara this month (they opened just a short time ago).  I love this place; it is clean, the staff are friendly and acommodating, and the service is fast.  The sushi is always delicious ((I've been here 3 times) and the prices are reasonable. In fact, this week my husband stopped in for take out, bought 4 sushi rolls and the total was $24.  That is amazing.    I love the freshness of the food and there's a huge selection to choose from.  Everyone on the eastside, check this place out!",
    "Awesome little shop.  The owner really knows his stuff and you can tell he loves his work.  They have tires and other parts you won't find anywhere else.",
    "Been here so many times before and all I can say is the food is really good. A hidden gem in Florissant, it has the best Panang curry around. Haven't been to their sister restaurant yet, but I can't seem to want to move on when I am always so satisfied with their fare here.",
    "My food only merited maybe two stars but I will give an extra star because I like the menu (and will try more of it) and their design and concept.  Sadly though, my tomato-basil soup tasted kind of like a weak marinara and my tuna melt type sandwich had a very sharp, off-putting flavor.  It was citrusy, for sure, and I love lemon in a tuna melt but perhaps this was lemon zest or something just way too overpowering?  I think next time I will focus on the dishes with cured Italian meats, mortadella and prosciutto.  And also the baked goods, those sounded pretty good, especially the Nutella bruschetta!",
    "We visited once and were very disappointed in my veggie pizza and my husband's sub sandwich.  The tomato sauce was not tasty, and they did not use enough cheese on my pizza.  The dough looked and tasted like it was prepared by a machine.  Perhaps they have improved, but we are not in any rush to try a second time.",
    "A couple friends and I stopped by for some late night milkshakes and found ourselves at More Than Just Ice Cream. Well, we just got ice cream...not fully taking advantage of what the name implies, but maybe next time.  3 milkshakes: 1 coffee, 1 chocolate, and 1 black&white malt.   All were pretty good. Definitely satisfied the ice cream craving. I thought my coffee milkshake could have been thicker, same goes for the chocolate. The black&white was plenty thick and was probably the best of the three. Unfortunately, I did not order that one so I settled for my not so creamy coffee.  I did sample some ice cream flavors before setting on a milkshake. I tried the pumpkin pie which was AMAZING. I don't know why I didn't just get this. Maybe a milkshake isn't the way to go here.",
    "My husband and I took my mother here for her 100th birthday! We can't say enough about the treatment we received: from a great table and view, to delicious \"compliments of the chef\" extra dishes, to a beautifully decorated cake plate, to the warm and attentive servers. It was much more than we expected, even for this very special occasion. For us, it was a wonderfully memorable experience.",
    "Man. This place is nice. The bartender was awesome. Try the burger. It's fresh with all local ingredients. The plates of food I saw come out looked amazing as well.   The beer is cold. The drinks are mixed perfectly.  This is not a chain restaurant but a dedicated local place with good employees.",
    "I visited this restaurant 4 times during my 5 days stay. Crazy, right? Here are a list of reasons/pros:  - We were staying a nearby hotel. - The restaurant opens 11 - 10:30 pretty much every day including new year's day so it fits into our schedule. - If you are a party of two, chances are you get seated right away. - $9 per dozen of oysters which is a really great deal by any standard! - They have a seafood shop next door that sells boiled and fresh seafood to- go. - Our server (same) is very friendly and recognized us every single time.  Now I want to talk about the reasons why I only give it 3 stars.  - We tried a bunch of stuff which are all pretty mediocre. Raw oysters are not cleaned well. So if your schedule is flexible, go to Superior Seafood during their happy hours for their 50 cents/oyster - better quality and cheaper. Turtle soup has a strange taste so I definitely prefer Felix's. A portion of my boiled shrimps are always mushy somhow, maybe boiled for too long?... - The ambient is inviting but not comfortable so we basically just finished our food and go.  - Clean the bathroom!!  Will probably visit again if we stay in the area next time or simply just pick up some seafood quickly.",
    "Skip this train wreck if you are looking for dinner.  Our server was clueless...like we seriously thought she was lost in the restaurant.  Had to ask for setups, water refills, etc.  Ordered chicken parmesan and got eggplant parmesan instead with a fish bone in it.  The drinks were good.",
    "Meh is all I can say for TDS. The restaurant itself is just cold.... not literally, but figuratively. There was no decor, no menu boards, stainless steel prep tables as dining tables, no soda machines, staff EVERYWHERE with no identification (shirts, nametags, etc). The food is reasonably priced and most of it was quite good, but what really irked my party was the fact that they charge for extra salsa!!! We ordered a salsa trio (which included 3 samples of the various salsas, in 2oz glass prep bowls), and when my brother asked for more salsa for his tacos (mind you, we ordered one of ever taco, three burritos and guacamole), he was told he'd have to buy the trio again! Really!!??? We spent over $40 on food, drinks and apps, too. Even though the food was decent, I wouldn't return as the atmosphere is just blah and you can't get extra salsa for your damn tacos!",
    "I'm so incredibly happy with our pictures! Angela Clifton Photography have worked with us 3 times and we have been happy with every single picture that was taken! Not only are the photos fabulous, but we had such a fun experience. The price is extremely reasonable and the pictures will be a keepsake we will cherish forever!",
    "Enjoyed my fish out at a sidewalk table.  A bit pricey but food was good.  Go to Side street in French quarter if u want quieter dining outside.",
    "The court house is very old and the art is great. The spiral staircase is funny. One can get view of entire city from 5th level. The tower clock room is really surprising with all mechanical gears inside!! You need a prior appointment to get into clock room. Worth spending 2 to 3 hours of time here.",
    "I had the pleasure to meet with Ann today and not only was she extremely helpful and so positive, she went above and beyond to make my 1st experience here amazing and made it a absolute regular customer from this day forward. Thanks girlie!!",
    "This is the first time I tried this place and  I was surprisingly surprised. I had a combination dinner pad Thai and coconut soup. The soup was very tasty as I never had coconut soup before. The pad Thai was exactly what I was expecting and it did not disappoint. The restaurant had great Thai decor and music. The staff and service was top notch. For a town with not much selection for food, this was a great change of pace. This may become my go to place in Carp.",
    "This place was so chill and relaxing. When I come back it'll definitely be in my list if stops. Not to mention the artist performing was fun and eclectic  (I mean really, a country version of \"Let It Go\", what's not to love?)",
    "Id you haven't been to the Smoothie King center since it was know as the New Orleans Arena, you are in for a nice surprise. The arena has had a face lift and, while the seats are the same,  everything else has been refreshed.     Most importantly,  the food options are far more varied and appeal to many tastes.  The quality of the food is very good and significantly improved from a few years back. The drink options are much improved as well and include full service bars, spiked lemonade,  bottled and draft beer and of course, smoothies.  There is even a spot for sweets. You can get funnel cake, cotton candy, and all kinds of delicious things I was too full to take in.    The venue finally feels a bit swanky and top notch.  We are moving on up!",
    "Don't know what it is but If my tummy's feeling icky, I can count on Chipotle's stake to fix me up. I just have to remember not to go during full on lunch time. I usually go between 2 & 4 when it's peaceful and calm. Busy or not the service is always friendly and fast!",
    "I must admit, I wasn't expecting much. This place totally blew us away. This has to be one of the best Indian restaurants in the Tampa Bay. The ambience is wonderful including white table linens. The best part was the food, OMG. The chicken 65 was to die for, and the hot sour soup was rich and flavorful. The waitress (Angel) was friendly,  attentive and very pleasant. They opened just a week ago. I'm sure this will soon be the place foodies seek out for real Indian food.",
    "Had to wait until my third trip to NOLA to actually get in the door.  First two times I tried waiting in line, this time around we got smart and bought reserved seats so we could be on the benches. Well worth the extra $20 to not hassle with waiting in line for an hour. It goes toward the preservation of Jazz so it's a good cause...just splurge.  The show was fantastic.  True musicians and great personalities to boot. I can only imagine that this is what concerts were like 50 years ago. The band members were dapper, engaging and insanely talented.  It's in a tiny hole in the wall space that only holds maybe 200 people? So it's very intimate and nice to see the smiles on the faces of the musicians as they share their craft with you. This is a must do while in NOLA!",
    "A GREAT EXPERIENCE!!!!!!!!!  I was a completely new customer.  I did not have an appointment because my other plans got rained out and my dealership was too busy to take me.  I needed a PA State & Emissions  inspection which I dread because they can be a total ripoff at some places when they add things on and I just wanted to get it over with.  I saw that this place had much better reviews on Yelp than many other shops in the area.  Keystone Discount Tire took my 2008 Pontiac Torrent in for inspection while I waited and had some free coffee.  I only had to get up once to look at some irregular outer front tire wear on my car when it was on the rack during inspection.  I always appreciate it when the technician lets me look at the problem.   It was nothing major.  Easily correctable with an alignment sometime in the future.  Bill was very friendly, knowledgable, and straightforward with his overall analysis of my car.  My car was fully inspected and stickered in less than an hour without my bill being jacked up with add-ons.   I recommend getting on their mailing list for their coupons!!!!!!!!!!",
    "Wow! I never thought my sons phone could be repaired after he dropped it but it is and it took less than a half an hour! Very professional and excellent service! I'm thrilled!",
    "Service and management terrible... After messing up all 4 of our orders the waiter got mad and started cursing... The manager offered our drinks to be free.. What a mess. The food was cold and nasty didn't even eat half of it and waited over an hour... I will never dine in any cracker barrel again after this experience...",
    "I have been to a number of dog friendly hotels...just not in the city and did not know what to expect. Usually they are motel like.  This one was in the heart of the city.  I walked tentatively into the hotel lobby as i have a labrador/golden mix who is not easy to hide.  We got to the front desk to register and i was still feeling uneasy although my  bf had assured me it was a dog friendly hotel. Reception was so nice immediately putting us at ease. As we checked in an attendant asked if Bentley could have treats which she fullly enjoyed. The Reception person also asked if we would like a welcome kit for Bentley. Holy moly. Of course. Dog dishes, a mat, treats, etc. I was blown away.    Plus the guests at the hotel all stopped to compliment and pet \"queen Bentley\". Our room was on the top floor. Awesome!  Even when i went to walk her the car attendants greeted her by name. We were so impressed with the service we decided to come back an extra night.   Thank you Loews. I didnt realize a hotel could be so dog friendly especially to a big dog.",
    "Sometimes this food is very very good.  Unfortunately it's not consistent.   Ordered something I've been getting for years and every other time it tastes incredible. It's like they have different people in the kitchen and you don't know who you will get. So 50 % of the time it's excellent.  UGH.",
    "Been to this location twice and will never go back again!!!!  First time was mediocre, the second time was so very disappointing it beggars belief. I ordered some ribs and had to send them back because one half was warm and the other half was refrigerator cold. They came back and one side was really hot and the other side was still cold, third time it was edible. The manager came over the third time to apologize, never once offered to comp anything. I'm not the kind of guy to cause a fuss to get something comped, but to send something back three times to get it cooked properly and only get an insincere apology really pisses me off, enough for me to write this review.",
    "After trying a few ramen places with crazy variety in their selections and stellar broth, I was not too excited about the ramen I got at Cheu.  Maybe it's a matter of taste, but personally, I was not a fan of their thick noodles, and extremely salty broth.    The service was great, and they had a nice selection of beers!  The friend I went with loved it, and has been many times.  Honestly, I'm just sorry I wasn't a bigger fan.  But I hope others try it for themselves.  I might just be an oddball out on this one.",
    "Federal Doughnuts is a new concession at the ballpark -- who doesn't love some doughnuts and fried chicken?    Also, there is now a concession stand near 136 that is gluten-free dedicated.  They offer pizza, cheesesteaks and even brownies and cookies.",
    "Looks like there is a second Red Kings restaurant in Chinatown and it did not disappoint! Since this place just opened yesterday, I'm not exactly sure if it's replacing the other Red Kings down the street, or if it is just a second helping of spicy, Szechuan food.  We ordered takeout and picked up the Dan Dan Noodles and a shredded Pork in Garlic sauce dish. The spice level in both dishes was perfect.  Extremely mouth-burning, but with delicious flavors that were sweet, earthy, and fresh. The portions were very generous and will make for great leftovers for us. I can't wait to try some of the other dishes and come back here for a sit-down dinner. They also have karaoke rooms upstairs, plus they are BYOB.",
    "This is one of the busiest Chick fil A's I've seen but they always manage to be quick and have exceptional service! I seriously don't know how they can be so quick and great all the time! One of my favorite places!",
    "Best place for salads! I go there every time I'm in town for lunch. It's fast and veggies are always fresh.",
    "My parents and I took the Oak Alley and Laura Plantation tour on September 26th, 2015.  I forgot the name of our driver-he was very informative on our drive to the plantations.  The schedule is perfect!  We were dropped off where we had time before and after the tour for free time to walk around the properties.  They are very flexible with drop off locations on the return drive.  We got off near Jackson Square and got to enjoy the rest of the afternoon in the French Quarter.",
    "We have been here twice for brunch and have enjoyed it immensely. Everything we have tried has been delicious, particularly the grits with scallions and sour cream. But the room is always freezing so be sure to bring a sweater!",
    "Love this place...best hot dogs and chili dogs around...i go here as many times as i can..yum",
    "Sweet spot in the Waterline. Came for some live music with friends on Saturday. Very cool. Best local beer in town by far. Seems like the concept is a few notches up from Fig Mountain. Definitely prefer Topa. Even cooler is that you can order incredible food from the Nook Restaurant, and walk two feet into Lama Dog which is part of the Waterline. I love it!!",
    "Great customer service! We were a little out of their pick up area but they were very accommodating and came and got our group of 7. When we got there we realized we were billed for 8 instead of 7. I called and he refunded my money for the extra ticket in minutes!  The tour itself was SO much fun! We were laughing and smiling and our tour guide was funny! We saw lots of alligators! From babies swimming in the water to full grown ones! We saw turtles and birds too! Our tour guide had a baby alligator we could hold that he's raising until it's a little bigger since it was a late hatch that would have died because of when it was born. The ride back was fun too because we went fast and the guide did some \"tricks\" with the boat! I highly recommend this tour!!!",
    "Westfall replaced our roof in April. We could not be more pleased with the entire process. Quality roof, excellent communication and excellent follow up. Very happy we chose this company to replace our roof.",
    "Good food, reasonably priced, and nice staff. Not ideal for eating in, but since they are going for a fast food approach to vegan food, that makes a lot of sense. I know the buffalo bella is the dish that they push the hardest, but for my money the Cheesesteak is the way to go. And pro-tip: Get the sweet potato fries.",
    "The ramen is okay, nothing spectacular. Service is okay. Good place for a quick stop but wouldn't go if there were other choices. Been here twice, will continue to go.",
    "A menu that satisfies everyone's cravings! Clean, trendy, and delicious! I definitely recommend going early (before 9 am) as the wait tends to get longer after 9 am! But honestly, it is soooo worth the wait. You will leave there feeling so incredible satisfied!",
    "Had the brisket sandwich with two sides and a drink for 9.99 - Great barbecue at an affordable price. Wonderful side such as potato casserole cream spinach baked beans green beans",
    "The food and service was amazing! I only wish they had any vegetarian/vegan options. Can't wait to come back!",
    "Great food. Terrible customer service. I've been three times and I've had two different older waitresses. Not pleasant to deal with whatsoever. The owner on the other hand is lovely.",
    "I first heard about this place on the plane ride over from a Franklin local.  He recommended that we brave the line and try one of Nashvilles best breakfast spots.  HE WAS RIGHT.  Holly cow this place kicked butt and we didn't even have to wait in line!! We were lucky to miss the rush said our waitress.   I had this super savory corn pancake with bacon, salsa, and sour cream. So good. This place will always be a stop when I get back to the south~~~",
    "OMG!!! I can't believe this kind of service exists!  My husband called to make an appointment for full detailing for next Sat with Michael, he called again to confirm on Fri before we head there since it's a distance from our home.  Michael said he didn't know we wanted to do full detailing thou we specifically mentioned that.  He advised us to come the following sat instead.  We agreed and we reached there at 8am on the following week.  Guess what?  Nobody is at the workshop, it's closed!  We called him and he said he is busy and will call back.. We waited for half an hour in our car and there is still no call from him.  We headed for our breakfast and came back again at 9:30am hoping to give him another chance.  Here comes Alex, his partner opening the shop at 9:30am!  1.5 hours away from our appt time and still no sight of Michael.  Alex tried calling Michael and couldn't get hold of him.  We gave up!!! What a horrendous experience!",
    "I had numerous things happen during my move and required additional services from this office. The guys in this office are top notch and are very trustworthy. I'd say more about how they took great care of me, but they may have gone above and beyond what they should have and afraid to say too much. I would recommend this office to my mother!",
    "We stayed at The Saint last year for a girl's trip. The lobby is lovely, they have a cool bar and restaurant that you can't help but to \"ohh and ahh\" over when you walk in.  All the things I'm accustomed too when I stay at a hotel anywhere...ambiance, a little sexy but not overkill! Everyone is so friendly, etc.  I'm thinking \"oh shhhh this is going to be a great weekend!\"  I checked in a few hours before my girl arrived because I had a ton of work i needed to do. So I set up my laptop ordered some room service and worked for about 4 hours straight. Left out to buy a bottle and get a mani/pedi.  My girl arrives...its about to be some trouble in NOLA... the two of us and no supervision...we pop out for dinner, come back in giggling as usual and we see it...a HUGH flying roach.  I'm freaked out.  I literally walk right out of the room down to the front desk.  I CANNOT!!!! They tell me they're sending a maintenance worker to handle it.  NOT GOOD ENOUGH! If there's one that's bold enough to show itself, he has other cohorts that prefer to live behind the scenes. They give us another room but tell me they can't do more until 8am.  No the room the move us too also has small spiders and other dead small bugs in the corners of the window. The TV doesn't work and one of the lamps doesn't have bulbs in it! COME ON!  At this point its about 3am and I know I'm not staying here past 8:15am. I dont want to sit my purse let alone my luggage in this hotel! I go online to my normal go to hotel, The W and book us there for the rest of the trip! 8am comes and goes no manager comes to our room. I go down and demand to see someone immediately.  This younger gentlemen comes out and apologizes.  I thank him for his apology and politely request ALL of my money back immediately.   He obliged and asked if  I would consider coming back after changes have been made! Bless his heart. NO dear!",
    "Say you decide that you need a new door...and you only have $35.  Where do you go?  the Green Project.   Or you have a bunch of left over building supplies, random bits of lumber, some roofing materials, maybe even some paint?  Where can you bring it so it doesn't end up in a landfill?  Again, the Green Project.",
    "Worst place I've ever visited. The bouncer was rude and he didn't have to be. This place thinks just cause your on broadway you can treat people bad and over charge.   I'm not a tourist I live here and will never visit or recommend",
    "Stopped in for the lunch menu with my girlfriend, place was extremely clean, food was ON POINT!  And AFFORDABLE Can't wait to go back!!",
    "So disappointing on so many levels. Have been coming here for years - and the quality of food has fallen off a cliff. Strike one - we shared an artichoke to start - and clearly it had been prepared beforehand (eg, cold on the inside - but the flesh was cooked through)  Strike two - my wife had a Greek salad - and it clearly all came from a bag and was extremely overdressed with tasteless dressing.  Strike three - I had grilled yellowtail which was basically execrable - could not even finish it (overcooked and an inferior-frozen piece of fish - unacceptable for SB).   In short - great setting, good service - but with such horrible food - not worth the visit. This place really needs to up the quality of food - or it's going to end up just another lower State dive for the tourists.",
    "Milktooth is the place to go if you want a good breakfast cocktail and a twist on traditional brunch. At first glance of the menu, you may think you've never heard of any of these foods for breakfast, and you may be right. I guarantee no matter what you order, you're going to enjoy it.   Milktooth is one of the most popular brunch places in Indy, which means you will typically have a wait. Trust me, it's worth the usual 30 minute wait (on weekends). To make it go by a little faster, they've got a walk up bar for their coffee drinks and pastries. Snack on one of those to give you a preview of the amazing meal you're about to have.  Their menu changes from time to time but they have a few things that stay one the menu but change ingredients. I love all of their variations on a Dutch pancake, and their raclette grilled cheese is to die for.  If you're making this a boozy breakfast, don't pass up on the michelada. And sit outside if it's warm enough!",
    "The bar and staff are AMAZING. we got a room upgrade for have been being on our honeymoon and the view was gorgeous. But, the room was not any better than a hilton. It had rust in the tub floor, and some weird stains on the tile. But this was only in the bathroom, so i give it 4 stars! Great staff, but too much for valet so we parked a couple streets down. That was the only other con I would say.   Would recommend if you want to be literally in the working downtown area of st. louis. Lots of cool bars and restaurants on a friday night.",
    "I took the beginning class there, and I loved it. It was perfectly paced, and though the moves weren't difficult, they really stretched me in places I didn't know existed! I even broke a small sweat! But I felt great afterwards! The studio is clean, and I like that I can buy some Beyond Organic food items there too.",
    "Not sure why it took until now for us to find this place. We started out going to the chain lobster restaurant but wanted something more authentic. A friend recommended Lobster Haven and I checked it out online. Looked like a type of place we would eat at in Massachusetts when we visit family. We were not disappointed! Service was great, fast and very friendly. Huge selection of all of the favorites. You have to visit this place if you want authentic New England seafood. You can also purchase live lobster and fresh seafood to go and cook it yourself.",
    "Fabulous! Best happy hour, fresh menu, Delish- drinks, if I had the time, I'd come here every day!",
    "Men's clubs is the tits, plain and simple. All the barbers got skills enough to hook it up fresh. Been coming here for 3 years and I've never had any problems. Except for maybe that one time when this dude tried to steal my cut. Tim kept it real though and said \"I can't give you the same cut as Ryan.\" Thanks Tim.",
    "My husband and I come here often. We love the food here, it's always fresh and the service is great. We highly recommend this place to anyone who loves sushi & hibachi.",
    "Oh Chickie's and Pete's, you are the perfect place to watch some sports and indulge.   No doubt this is not the best food I've ever had but, if you can get a seat, grab some beer with mussels red and crab fries, there's no way not to thoroughly enjoy this place during a game or any time you're down by the stadiums.   My favs are the crab fries, mussels red (white is overloaded with garlic that I can't always take it), the spicy pull and peel shrimp, steamers, and if the mood is right the blue crabs (it's a lot of work but tasty). This place also makes getting down and dirty with your food easy. There are sinks all over so you can rinse the mess off your hands once you're done....good touch.  To sum it up, Chickie's and Pete's is a Philadelphia institution and always a good time. I strongly suggest going at least once to enjoy the experience.   Please note: Make sure to remember two things before coming during major sporting events. 1. You'll never get a table and 2. You'll deal with a ton of drunk people. I've absolutely been one of these people before and we can get annoying unless you're in the right frame of mind. :)",
    "Prompt and professional. On a Saturday. Simple mirror fix, but they made it easy for me. I have used them in Charlotte and they were great then, too.",
    "Good choice in Union Station St. Louis.  I had the Ponchartrain (server said it is same as Tilapia, though that was also on the menu, so why two names for the same fish, I have no clue).  The Ponchartrain was quite good with mushrooms and a cream sauce.  We also had the shrimp cocktail and lump crab cake appetizers....both fine, but not wonderful.  Drinks and service were perfectly acceptable.  We dined outside on the patio since the weather was nice - inside looks comfy and a bit less casual.",
    "I stopped in for a drink yesterday and have to say the atmosphere gets an A+ from me.  Such a unique concept for the St. Pete area.  The attention to detail with the remodel was outstanding, it almost feels like you are in a Harry Potter movie or something.  There is background music that is set at a low volume so you can clearly hear your friends or not have to shout for them to hear you - perfect for the old library-esque environment. Working behind the bar were Michael and Peggy - both couldn't have been more friendly and were overall just interesting people to talk to.   I had eaten dinner already before I came so can't speak on the food but will definitely be back to try - the prices for meat/cheese trays are much better than comparable places in the area.  I would definitely recommend checking this place out...",
    "Yes! I love this place! Maple Street Patisserie is the bomb.com! I've never been disappointed. Best blueberry muffin I've ever had in my whole entire life. Delicious breakfast and lunch spot. They also do specialty cakes so swing by during Mardi Gras and grab a king cake. Also the owner, Ziggy, is the man. He's always running around working crazy hours to make all these scrumptious baked goods. Can't beat this place :)",
    "Really good burger. I had the Bourbon Black and Bleu. It was cooked like I wanted and very tasty.   I gave them 3 stars for the wait. We had a big party - 4 adults and 5 kids - and it took over an hour to get our food. Shouldn't have taken that long, regardless of how many people were at our table.",
    "It seems to me that whenever we have out of towner guests, our go to place is consistently Katie's. The variety of food wonderfully prepared is 2nd to none. Reasonably priced and delicious, Katie's never disappoints. Whether you choose the grilled ersters, the shrimp and grits, the Cuban sandwich, pizza, or soup & salad you will be very pleased and have a great meal. Daily specials hi-lite local seasonal offerings that keep things fresh. The service staff are warm and friendly. On Sunday's, you will want to time your arrival before church let's out or you will have a bit of a wait. That said, you can always manage while enjoying bottomless Mimosas!",
    "Came in after attending the Zurich Classic golf tournament. It was a warm and a bit humid so what tastier then a ice cream cone? I lucked out and found a parking space on the street. The interior is quite cute and comfy.  The selection here is crazy huge but after sampling a couple of unusual flavors I went with the scoop of cookie monster ice cream on a cone. The ice cream hit the spot and I enjoyed it BC it wasn't overly sweet.  Creole Creamery was definitely worth checking out!",
    "I LOVE this place!  I have been coming here for a few years now.  Its a little funky, and I would never order say the escargot, for safety reasons, but when it comes to lots of Saki, great rolls, and mountains of rice and Sashimi, this is the way to go.  Young atmosphere, loud dance music, and SAKI!",
    "We absolutely love everything we have tried here. Our favorite thus far has been the Backyard Bowl, although there are several more that we still need to try. My husband and I are always full after we each get a kids size, or split a large. The ingredients are good quality,  filling foods. For the quality of ingredients, the price is very reasonable. It can get pretty busy here, but have patience, it is worth the wait.",
    "It's was okay service was a bit on the interesting side as the person was new. Food presentation was good though they need to either add rice or more potato salad to the gumbo. Sprite was flat but I didn't need it anyways.",
    "This is a pretty good pancake place, but it's a little disorganized in the way it's run when it's really busy. The pancakes are pretty good but super sweet, so you have to be in there. Good price point. Serves breakfast all day so that's definitely a plus, but not anything particularly special that you couldn't get anywhere else.",
    "Great finds and wonderful staff!  LOVE our finds and will definitely be back!!!",
    "We've been coming here since I was a kid. The staff has watched me and now my kids grow up. They're personable and so nice. They're also very prompt with service. Yoli and frank are the absolute best! The food is amazing! I absolutely love their shredded beef burro and cheese crisp. I feel they have true authentic Mexican food.",
    "Dine-in gets 2 stars. Disappointing service & venue falls short.   The food was ok; so if you were to do take out, maybe this place would get 3 stars.   I ordered the lamb kebab, which tasted ok; but it was very plain. No sauces, lettuce or anything - just meat.",
    "The best middle eastern restaurant in this area!! Food is great and consistent!! Makes my tummy happy!!!",
    "I cannot even believe someone gave this place one star. Here's the scoop. They have the BEST cannoli in the city. Termini's are no where NEAR as good, and Isgro's is far too hyped up for the quality. Potito's is my go to for cannoli, i wouldn't even THINK about going anywhere else. I'm there every xmas eve, and will be for the rest of my days. I stood in line for isgros for TWO HOURS this year for a tirimisu, i walked right into potito's and picked up my bambino cannoli stuffed cannoli. it's as good as it sounds, trust me.",
    "Truly, I cannot say enough good things about this tiny, authentic, perfectly delicious eatery!  Growing up in the panhandle of Texas, we had plenty of authentic Mexican food in our home, and I'm always searching for good Mexican restaurants. El Limon is the best I've ever had in the state of Pennsylvania!  Sopes, tostadas, enchiladas, fajitas, burritos, fish tacos....all excellent and sooooo reasonable!  Waitstaff is always pleasant and attentive.  Best two features: homemade tamales and free margaritas!!  Bring the entire family for an amazing Mexican feast!  Ole!",
    "I'm giving this joint 4 stars because they have earned it, but they are definitely 5 star material, if they work out a few kinks. Granted, they just opened, so some of the errors I've experienced (I work in the area, so I've been there several times) will probably get worked out and they are more than willing to make corrections and accommodations when they mess up.   But over all, the food is REALLY good. Unlike my fellow Yelp-ers, I would say that ther pizza is not their strong suit - its kinds greasy and not sure if they use 100% mozzarella - tastes like its cut with something cheaper. However, so far I've had:    The Quaker (Chicken version) - Delicious. They make their chicken steaks with the chunky chicken, which I like much more than the shredded version. They could season the chicken more, but the cheese was melted perfectly and the veggies were fresh.   The fries - crisp and flavorful. I didn't even need ketchup, and I always eat ketchup on my fries  The onion rings - a little greasy, but very tasty and crisp. The onions stayed in the breading and didn't slide out when you bit them (which I hate).   Spanakopita - mine was a little over cooked, but the flavors were really good  Baklava - VERY GOOD!   Signature Salad - The veggies they use are very fresh which will make or break a salad. Their balsamic is great too!  The (turkey) Greek Burger - one of the best turkey burgers I've ever had! The patty was moist and flavorful all on its own, but then they top it with what must be homemade tzatziki. I could eat a bowl of that stuff! My burger had romaine instead of the advertised arugula, but it was very fresh, so I didn't mind as much. I also asked for feta, which I didn't get, but that sauce made me forget all about it.   Overall, this place is great! Provided they don't stray from the high quality standard they are setting, I will keep going back.",
    "Planet fitness gets four stars just because it is open 24 hours. If you are looking at cheapest it's cheapest best bang for your buck . Not much motivation since bodybuilders don't go there much mostly big women . No pun intended . No discrimination I myself used to be big, although I changed that .  Tanning bed and massage chairs and a sculpt machine and everything. Else for 20.00 a month . 9.99 - the massage and stuff and can't bring friends . All the employees are polite and helpful .",
    "Very disappointed. We went to eat  at 2:15 on Saturday and were told the kitchen closed at 2. Their website says: Sat & Sun all day. Their website claims that they are open until 5. I'm always a bit suspect of places that can't manage simple details like their hours on their website. It makes me wonder about the awareness to quality and other \"small\" items.",
    "These guys do good work, on time, and warranty their work.  I would highly recommend them!",
    "Eat here at least 2 times a week. Servers are always friendly and the food is amazing. I never leave disappointed & always leave with a full stomach",
    "A truly delightful find! This is the transformed Carrow's Restaurant on Plumb and Kietzke that was saved by the wrecking ball by its beautiful redwood beams and fascia. The food was fantastic. My wife had the tri-tip salad -- greens on one side of the plate with a balsamic vinagrette balanced by four good-sized slices of medium-rare tri-tip and potato \"croutons\" -- little heavenly bits of crunchy potatoes. I had the tri/tip/chicken combo, selecting the fresh corn salad and potato salad as my two sides. It was so good that we ordered dessert as well (not something I do regularly). The offering was lemon meringue, mudd pie, apple pie, and ice cream. We shared the first -- again delicious, with real, perfectly set and browned meringue. The prices were very reasonable for the quality of food and the experience. We've already recommended to family and friends locally, and expect to return soon. Well done!",
    "Rebecca didn't Doula my birth.  BUT, she was our nanny to our first born daughter.  Over the months of her being in my home, I realized that I looked forward to talking to her before & after work.  I was big & pregnant with Baby #2, and her information & suggestions hit home with this expectant Momma!  She was always easy to talk with, yet honest and extremely truthful!  (A trait I LOVE!!!).  She loves the special role she plays as Doula to laboring woman!!  She finds beauty and strength in that magical time. Bec would be a great addition to your support team!!!",
    "Recently had my car tinted by Orange Tint and Tune and had fantastic service.  They offer a car pick up service if you live within 4 miles of their shop which is extremely convenient.  Carlos was my technician and went over all the tint options with me and even adjusted the grade of the tint after I expressed the look that I was trying to achieve.  That's the kind of customer care that deserves 5 stars.  In addition, the receptionist was very pleasant and the owner Dustin even followed up to see how my service was.",
    "Stayed here three nights on business.  The property is located very close to the airport but you really don't hear it.  The rooms are standard TownePlace Suite rooms with a refrigerator, stove, etc..  The area in which the hotel is located is quiet with a combination of other hotels and office buildings.  It's about a 20 minute drive to the downtown or university area.  About 5-10 minutes from Pima Air Museum.  There are not too many restaurants close by but there are some fast food options and a sandwich place called Baggins that was really good and within walking distance.  The staff of the hotel was really friendly and helpful.  The breakfast is standard continental with a couple of hot options. They also have a reception on weekday evenings.  My only complaint is that the food and drink go quickly so get there early.  You could use this as a dinner if you wanted.  I got there about 45 minutes after it started and although there was food left there were very few soft drinks left (no diet).  They could improve by keeping the area stocked throughout the period.  Anyway, the rooms are nice, beds are comfortable and area is safe.",
    "We got diverted to Tampa and decided to make the drive to Orlando but first we needed somewhere to eat. Wanting to avoid chain restaurants, yelp steered us towards this little local gem!  The ladies had the 7 oz. Tampa strip and the gents both had a 14 oz. ribeye. They grill their steaks over oak and citrus Wood and the smoky flavor is to die for! We are big fans of our smoker back home and cook our steaks this way as well, it's rare to find steak cooked over woodsmoke in most places and this was worth the side trip!  Sides were veggies and sweet potatoes. The wines on offer were so reasonably priced- most under $20 a bottle but a decent selection. They just don't mark them up 5x like most places!   Our waitress Lisa also made great recommendations and her service was welcoming, friendly, and excellent. We are so glad we went local instead of to a chain. Bookmarking this place for a return trip next time I am in Tampa for sure!",
    "The owner of this location (and two others including Southampton) reached out to me after my previous review. We ended up talking for half an hour and I was very impressed with his approach to business... he's definitely the type of person I want to do business with. I returned to Saladworks on two separate occasions and the service had vastly improved. The new summer salads are wonderful!",
    "By far the best deli I have ever been to in the US. YEP, the US. Lots of crazy choices and oh it is hard to pick!! The Muffalata is so big 4 people can share. It is so tasty and amazing! Go on Saturday or Thursday night when they have live music! The special is always a good pick and don't worry there are plenty of sides to choose from. Great Chili, potato salad and of course chips. GO NOW...",
    "My dad and I are on a cross country trip and one of our first stops was Saguaro National Park.  We did a quick tour with Park Ranger Carolyn and loved it. She was incredibly enthusiastic and passionate about her studies on the saguaro and she was very knowledgeable. Definitely recommend both the tour and Carolyn.",
    "Came here after my husband bought home their lemon pepper wings. They have plenty of flavors. Ranging from ones you've heard of (lemon pepper, mild) to New Orleans flavors (yaka mein, noonie bird). They also have their drinks. The watermelon is to die for. I don't know what they put in it but lord help them. The location isn't the best but they're trying to put something back in the community. It's in the same section with the daiquiri shop so it's really not that bad during the day. I probably wouldn't come at night by myself. Definitely give this place a try. Hey you might even see Skip.",
    "Back to Tom Jones and time to update my review. I didn't see that odd ATM type machine that only lets you withdraw money to apply to your check. It's no longer there-used to be next to restrooms. There is still a payphone back there which I love. There are now ATM's at front entrance.   The blue ribbon is now $3.79, but still a bargain since it includes everything: pancakes, 2 eggs, toast, sausage, bacon,juice & coffee. I ate here with my kids. My daughter's choice. Says she \"loves Tom Jones\". Our meals included blue ribbons, french toast, chicken, club sandwich & baked potato . Everyone gets what they like.     I don't smell stale smoke and would not call it dirty.  I like the \"loud\" orange booths. I feel like I went back in time with these and the payphone. Service is always fast and I always seem to get a different waitress. Don't know where they find these young ladies but they're good. I've seen different managers there and they are all quick and on top of things-which makes a good manager.    Since it's my daughter's fave I'm bumping it up from 4 to 5 stars.",
    "I am an amateur athlete. I first met Dr. Ferrel when I was playing softball. He was watching my game when I was severely injured.  He treated me on the field by relocating my ankle and then told me to come to his office for treatment. I told him I could not afford that as a single mom on a teacher's salary. Instead, I saw a physician. He said it would be months before I would play again. Depressed and without much hope, I reached out to Dr. Ferrel again. He did treat me as he promised. Not only did he treat me, he healed me within weeks instead of months. Over the years Dr. Ferrel has worked on me with amazing results each time. He will always be my hero...",
    "Always fun to go to their shows.  Entertaining and relaxed atmosphere. For a good time and good food at a fair price this is the place to go.",
    "Love in n out. There's just a mood for in n out that you have to fulfill sometimes.  What can I say. 4 patties animal style bruh",
    "Cindy is the best! Great food and service. Food is authentic and so is the staff. Everything is made fresh and you can taste the difference from other Mexican restaurants at first bite. I would recommend to anyone that enjoys Mexican cuisine.",
    "I've been wanting to try Trust Me BBQ for over a year now.  I stopped in there about 3 months ago and waited in line for 10 minutes with no service and left.  After reading reviews, I figured I'd give it a chance again just to see what all the fuss is about.  The food was 50/50 but the service was horrible so I'll likely never return.  The gentleman behind the counter didn't speak, smile or engage with us at all, I felt like I was at a vending machine.  Once we finally ordered, he didn't even listen to the order and put the wrong sides in our meals, we had to correct him while he was serving.  All in all, I will just stick with Down to the Bone BBQ  Pros:  BBQ Sauce is delicious, macaroni salad was different and interesting, \"pulled\" pork was moist.  Cons:  Chicken was more dry than a sheet of paper, inedible even with the BBQ Sauce.  Mac & Cheese was served from a pan that has probably been on the steam table for 2-3 days.  Collard Greens were very mildly flavored.",
    "Was in town for a week and came by this little hole in the wall.  The pa nang chicken was excellent.  I ordered one star spicy and it came quick.  Will definitely return.",
    "Cinco de mayo means margaritas and sangria and all things fried... this great place does a nice job with combining flavors of several different ethnicities and backgrounds and develops recipes that are unique.  Although not touted as a \"Mexican\" destination they know how to rock the rock salt and pour that tequila.  They also just opened a wine bar a couple doors down for overflow and specialty bottles.  A high five for the on the rocks margaritas and house made white or red sangria - definitely worth the trip!",
    "This small little donut bakery is located in one of Hermitage's oldest shopping centers!   I can imagine baking donuts is a hard job, let alone running the business...it's one of those jobs that starts in the wee hours of the morning so that the donuts are freshly made daily!  Yeu, the owner, serves not only your common popular donuts, but he also serves donuts with bacon on top, apple fritters, pigs in a blanket, breakfast pastries, and  kolaches....in addition to these yummy treats...he makes doughssants....they are what seems to be a scandalous marriage of a donut and a croissant...!!!!!!!! Need I say more? Yeah...you heard me. A doughssant! Worth the trip just to eat one of these!   Prices are considerably cheap! The doughssants are only $1.99 each! The regular donuts are about $.60 each!   These sweet donuts are my favorite treats to buy for my kid's school teachers...and they love them!   Coffee also served here!",
    "We have had a blast to each event we've been to.  We've been to concerts and basketball games and other were a lot of fun.  The food is really good, also.  A lot of local favorites are offered.",
    "Excellent food. We tried three appetizers and five entries and all of them were a hit. This prices are reasonable and the service is good. I'd go back again and again.",
    "The service here has gone down. We used to go here a lot but now we go to another one. The service was slow and forgotten about.",
    "Hands down the worst chicken and rice plate I've ever had. When I ordered I was told there was no sauce on the chicken (as I wanted, healthy). I ordered to go, by the time I reached the car the bag was full of oil spilling out of the container. There was easily 5-7 tablespoons of oil on the dish. Not what I was told and not what anyone would ever want to eat. Horrible.   Their slogan even has the word healthy in it. What a joke.",
    "Great experience purchasing a washer and dryer.  I just bought a new home and needed all new appliances. Iam so glad I decided to go even though the reviews were not great which I don't understand since I had no issues whatsoever. There was an excellent selection, knowledgeable salespeople and timely delivery. The level of service we received was beyond expected! I really felt like they were working hard to give me the best price and offered many options to stay in my budget  They even took the time to check if there were any additional sales prices or discounts they could offer me. I was given honest feedback and all of my questions were answered. I am very happy with Sears and I would highly recommend!",
    "The food here is great. They're quick and the staff is so nice, seriously. I always feel welcome when I place my order here.",
    "I finally got to try them. Wow..they did a great job with the remodle. I loved the mushroom cheese steak",
    "The espresso here is excellent. My favorite place to come for an Americano. The staff is polite and friendly and vibes are mellow. It is important to know that there is no access to power outlets, but unlimited wifi access. The bathrooms and the rest of the establishment are always clean.",
    "Went here based on the high ratings and raves from people.  The entire experience was underwhelming from start to finish.  Their website which is fairly useless if you want to figure out the menu before going, you have to pick your location choice out of 3 locations and then drill down to the bottom to see the weak descriptions of their menu offering, no explanations and no price, just this      Roast Beef     Roast Beef Combo     Roast Pork     Roast Pork Combo     Baked Ham     Baked Ham Combo     Roast Turkey     Roast Turkey Combo     Broccoli Rabe     Broccoli Rabe Combo   No explanation of whats in a combo (its just where they add cheese by the way)  The table placecard (instead of menu) had a more detailed description than the website.    When I walked in, its more bar than restaurant, no big deal, but there were tables.  Since I couldnt decide and the sandwiches werent too expensive at $6.85, I got the roast beef and roast port combos.  I got my two sandwiches fast enough, but the roast beef was cold and the roast pork was hot.  Not sure how a cook (for lack of a better word) could serve 2 things at the same time with such a temperature differential, one was obviously sitting for awhile.  I asked the waitress to reheat the roast beef while I finished the roast pork, and supposedly it was reheated, since it was warmer, but it was still cold-ish compared to my roast pork I had just finished.  The waitress did offer to replace it when she inquired, but I was in a hurry and didnt really care for a hot version of this sandwich.  The sandwiches were very skimpy on meat, but they \"made up for it\" by adding too much gravy to make it overly messy and the bread was disintegrating.  The menu place card mentions the \"wet meat\" option where you get less gravy, I strongly recommend you get it that style, especially if the gravy overpower the meat and structural integrity of the sandwich.",
    "Picked up takeout from Village Whiskey (so I can't review the actual restaurant). The Whiskey Burger is pricy ($26) but is amazing if you're ok with a greasier burger. Super tender, the bacon is awesome and it's pretty big. If you can get past the price then highly recommend it. The Duck Fat fries are also rich and delicious.",
    "Blew $80 on food for the family was worth it food was hot and orange chicken best I've tasted in a awhile..now it will be the place we get Asian food!!",
    "I typically do my laundry at my boyfriend's house, but I had family who recently stayed with me and had a bunch of towels, sheets, and comforters to wash.  I was searching for a laundry mat that would be safe, clean and not full of questionable people.  I was so happy to find this facility.  It is clean, well-lit, and the staff is so friendly and helpful.  I was amazed at the speed of the laundry and dryer.  I completed 4 oversize loads ( probably equal to 8 regular loads) in just under 2 hours!  This place has security cameras, flat screen T.V's, magazines, wi-fi, clean bathrooms, vending machines.  It is a wonderful atmosphere to do your laundry.  It was not overly busy, there are plenty of washers and dryers.  I am so happy that I found this place.  Thank you LAUNDROMAT!!!",
    "We ran in for a late night dinner last night. The prices are definitely high. Both couples decided to split a plate (you could tell the annoyed our server), and the food was good- but not worth the price for sure. I will say the garlic bread they bring out before the meal was AH-MAZING! I could have probably eaten my weight in just the bread.   Overall - I probably wouldn't eat there again myself. But it could have been an off night. There is just too much competition in the food world around St Louis!",
    "Stopped by to munch a burger during today's Seahawks/Saints game, and the place was, unsurprisingly, packed. For good reason, too: the Haven burger I ordered was fantastic.  I sat right next to the door, so I didn't get the chance to get more than six feet into the place; as soon as I got my meal, the place started getting busier and busier until I had to work my way through the World's Shortest People Maze to get out. Guess that means I wasn't the first person to hear about the place.  I will be going back to the Haven. Might go for, say lunch on a Tuesday, so it's less busy.",
    "I can only comment on the vermicelli bowls because I have never had the Pho.   The vermicelli are a decent size and a fair price. Conveniently located if you live in the Alberta Ave neighbourhood, my orders have always been ready in 15 minutes - even on a Friday night.",
    "I had the Chicken Marsala recommended by our waiter. The chicken was very thin, tough, and dry. The pasta was under cooked and stuck together. There was absolutely no flavor. My friend ordered the lasagne and did not like it all. There was only a thin layer of pasta and no flavor. My other friend was still eating her dinner and they cleared her plate when she went to the restroom, after she told the waiter she was not finished. They did bring her a new meal in a doggie bag. The positives are a Great atmosphere and live music. I enjoyed dancing with my husband. However, very expensive for awful food.",
    "This place is a gem.Attractive space, great location near Broad Street line, plenty on street parking. BYOB. I've been twice and enjoyed every dish. Highlights were the chaats, beef short ribs, lamb vindaloo, beet salad, breads/pickles, and chai. We got the chocolate cake for the table to share each time and everyone loved it. Can get takeout beer at the corner bar. We'll be back.",
    "This is my favorite restaurant!  I always order their ceviche, which is delicious.  The atmosphere is fun, and the service is great.  Alex was our server, and he was friendly, attentive and thoughtful.",
    "Love this store!  Who doesn't!  The salad bar is fresh and they have all types of ethnic food to try.  N-JOY",
    "Called in a Mediterranean chicken shawarma. Good flavor and they were generous with the amount of chicken in the pita. The food was ready to go when I arrived. Good service. I would revisit the next time I am in the area.",
    "I love this place.  The food is great and the space and staff are very pleasant.  Highly recommended for vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike.",
    "Took a while to get actual service but once we did I was happy. The gumbo was awesome and loved the chicken & waffles. Friendly staff and right on Bourbon St for good people watching!",
    "As airport grab-and-go restaurants are, Earl does a decent job with a variety of sandwich options including turkey, tuna and even a Hawaiian. But today I could smell the roast beef and so I got that one. Yum. Good portion of sliced beef that was beyond medium cooked with cheddar cheese and a yummy horseradish sauce. Nope, don't get lettuce or tomatoes on it. It's perfect the way it is.  And since it's right between the security station and the top of the D gates (right near the Delta SkyClub!), it's easy to get and eat at the gate or on board.",
    "WOW!  What a fantastic place!  Food A+, Service A+++  We started with an appetizer of cheese curds served with a red pepper jelly.  LOVED IT!  I ordered the fish tacos and the wife ordered a beer brat for dinner.  We both thoroughly enjoyed what we ordered!  The portions were huge and priced just right for the portion size.  Our server was on it!  Very attentive and was very knowledgeable about the menu and made us feel very welcomed.  The manager stopped by and asked how everything was.  I let him know that I am pretty sure I have found a cool new place to hang out, have a beer and watch football.  He said they have great deals on game days and let us know about their brunch on the weekends.  Everyone said goodbye as we walked out and reminded us to grab a rootbeer candy on our way out.  I will be back!",
    "I stopped in for dinner and a drink & was thoroughly pleased! I rarely order a burger when I go out to eat, because why order \"out\" what you can make easily a home, right? Well..... when I go back I'll have a hard time NOT getting another burger. Oh, they also have a decent beer selection and the wait staff/bartenders made me feel very welcomed too.  My food was prepared exactly as I ordered and was served quickly.  The restaurant has a nice atmosphere and the restrooms were clean.  All in all I was very happy! ."

    "Get ready for a culinary adventure that'll take you on a wild ride - literally! If you're brave enough to dine here, buckle up for a 2-hour extravaganza from start to finish! I've given this place multiple chances because I'm rooting for it - I've had amazing experiences at its NJ locations, and I want to love it just as much! The food is on point, but be prepared to wait... and wait... and wait some more! The young waitstaff is usually super friendly, but we've had one too many marathon dining sessions. That's why we often opt for a quicker bite at another diner or restaurant on weekends. So, if you're in no rush and ready to hang loose, this might be the spot for you!",
    "I've been spinning for years, but nothing beats the experience at Body Cycle. From the sleek, clean studio and top-of-the-line bikes to the motivating instructors who make you feel welcome, every class is a killer workout. Plus, their online scheduling system makes it a breeze to plan ahead - no need to wait in line for hours like at other gyms. I have to give a special shout-out to Russell, the owner, who's passion for fitness and cycling is infectious. He's always popping into classes to check in and offer encouragement, and he's open to feedback and suggestions. And despite pushing you to your limits, he always wears a smile on his face - it's inspiring!",
    "I recently visited a family-friendly diner located next to the Clarion Hotel. I opted for the buffet, which offered an eclectic assortment of dishes, including a large chicken leg, crispy fried jalapeño, a traditional tamale, two rolled grape leaves, and fresh melon. I was pleased to find that everything tasted great. The buffet featured a wide variety of Mexican-inspired options. In addition to the buffet, the diner also offers a menu with breakfast items available all day long. The staff were friendly and attentive, making it an ideal spot for a casual, low-key meal with no frills. Overall, I would recommend this diner for a relaxed dining experience.",
    "We highly recommend this restaurant! Our top picks are the lamb curry and korma, and they offer an impressive 10 varieties of naan. Don't be put off by the exterior - it's worth going inside and trying something new. You won't regret it!",
    "The interior of the establishment is charming, and the owner provided us with a tour of the forthcoming patio and rooftop area, which promises to be an excellent spot to enjoy on pleasant days like today. The cheese curds were exceptional and quite filling. We appreciated that the sandwiches came accompanied by a salad, particularly after indulging in the curds. I opted for the onion, gruyere, and tomato sandwich, which struck a nice balance in terms of cheese content. However, I felt that it required an additional element, such as pepper jelly, to elevate the flavor profile. It would be beneficial to see the menu expanded to include more options, such as salads featuring unique and artisanal cheeses. The beverage selection is extensive, with a wide range of beers and wines, as well as a limited cocktail menu. On my next visit, I intend to try one of the draft wines.",
    "As a loyal customer, I'm disappointed that I was turned away for takeout when the restaurant was only half full. I'm a frequent visitor and always leave generous tips. With Kanella now open, I'll be taking my business elsewhere and won't be returning to Dmitri's.",
    "I had an absolutely fantastic experience on this tour! The affordable price, courtesy of a Groupon deal, was the icing on the cake. As a newcomer to New Orleans with limited knowledge of its rich history, this tour proved to be the perfect introduction to the city. Our knowledgeable and engaging tour guide regaled us with a plethora of fascinating anecdotes about the city, making the experience truly unforgettable. I would highly recommend this tour to anyone seeking a comprehensive and enjoyable exploration of New Orleans. Initially, I assumed the tour would solely focus on the cemetery, but our guide cleverly structured the itinerary to include a captivating hour-long stroll through the historic French Quarter, followed by a riveting visit to the cemetery in the second half. The meeting point in front of a local grocery store may seem unusual at first, but it's easily locatable and provides a convenient opportunity to grab a refreshing drink before embarking on the adventure. Additionally, a midpoint stop at a visitor center allows for a brief respite and bathroom break, if needed. This tour was undoubtedly one of the highlights of my trip, and I would enthusiastically endorse it to anyone seeking a memorable experience in New Orleans.",
    "Get ready for a culinary explosion! The wings at this hidden gem are truly sublime, paired to perfection with their signature homemade bleu cheese that will leave you craving for more. And if that's not enough, the ribeye is a masterclass in tender, juicy goodness, cooked to perfection and bursting with flavor. To wash it all down, a curated selection of craft beers awaits, guaranteed to satisfy even the most discerning palate. Trust us, you won't want to miss this incredible dining experience - it's a must-visit destination that will leave you wanting more!",
    "This Easter, we opted for a trip to Los Padres National Forest instead of Lopez Lake. While the forest is truly breathtaking, our visit to White Rock was slightly marred by the overgrowth of dead grass on the rocks and in the water. It would be wonderful if the forest staff could clear this debris to restore the area's natural beauty. The water's greenish hue and murky appearance were also a concern. To maintain the forest's pristine condition, the staff at Los Padres National Forest need to prioritize upkeep and maintenance. In comparison, Cachuma Lake seems to receive more attention, making it a more appealing destination.",
    "So we had a group of 6 in for hibachi and it was a bit of a mess. Our waitress brought out our individual sushi orders all on one plate, which was super confusing, and she even forgot some stuff. I get that mistakes happen, but it was pretty dead in there, so you'd think they'd be on top of things. Usually, hibachi is a blast, but our cook, Francisco, barely said a word - although he did cook the food really well. The service was pretty meh, the food was okay, and I'm hoping it was just a one-off bad night. But honestly, for the price, I wouldn't come back.",
    "I had an absolutely phenomenal experience with Shalimar! When I needed my engagement ring resized, I was thrilled to hear that they could possibly do it within the day. The team confirmed the same-day service and quoted me a reasonable $40 for the job. I double-checked my size, gave the thumbs up, and left them to work their magic. But when I returned later that afternoon, I was dismayed to find the ring was too small. The twist? It was my mistake - I should've opted for a half-size up! \n\nTo my surprise, the Shalimar team was incredibly understanding and accommodating. They resized the ring again, this time to perfection, and handed it back to me within an hour - all at no extra cost! Their kindness and professionalism in the face of my embarrassing error won me over instantly. I'm forever grateful for this exceptional experience and can't wait to return to Shalimar for all my future jewelry needs!",
    "Locals raved about Milktooth, and it truly is a hidden gem in Indianapolis. I'm glad I had the opportunity to experience it.",
    "Unwind in style at this hotspot, where happy hour and dinner dreams come true! Escape the sweltering St. Louis heat on their fabulous patio, complete with refreshing fans to keep you cool and comfortable. But what really sets this place apart is their exceptional service - the team is always happy to accommodate your every need! And, be sure to try their mouthwatering Veal Milanese, expertly modified to swap out pasta for fresh mixed greens - a game-changing twist that's sure to delight your taste buds. The best part? They're more than willing to tailor their menu to your unique preferences, making every visit a truly personalized experience!",
    "Savoring every bite, I indulged in the heavenly gnocchi smothered in rich marinara sauce, and the crispy baked eggplant appetizer that left me craving for more. Although the service was glacially slow, the culinary masterpiece on my plate made it well worth the wait. I'd eagerly return, as the exceptional flavors have left an indelible mark on my palate.",
    "The bun is what makes the Sonoran Dog stand out. It's like a cozy blanket that wraps around the hot dog, making it warm, soft, and fragrant. At first, it may seem like too much, but it actually works well. The hot dog itself is flavorful, although I think it could benefit from a bit more snap to balance out the strong flavors of the mustard and onions. The carne asada caramelo is also excellent, with a great tortilla, salty cheese, and tender meat. Plus, it's very affordable and you can even drive through to pick it up.",
    "Excellent breakfast spot! The waffle was fluffy and perfect, and the home fries were crispy and delicious. Friendly service too. I'll definitely return!",
    "Exceptional dining experience! Douglas provided outstanding service that perfectly complemented the delectable cuisine. While the prices are steep (averaging $40-50 per entree), the upscale atmosphere rivals that of the nation's top restaurants, making it well worth the splurge.",
    "My husband and I are repeat customers at this restaurant, and we've consistently had exceptional dining experiences. The staff, from servers to bartenders, are extremely knowledgeable about the menu and have always been able to suggest modifications to accommodate my gluten intolerance. The wine and cocktail lists are impressive, and the food is truly exceptional. My only suggestion would be to add gluten-free dessert options, as we've had to go elsewhere for something sweet. However, this minor drawback doesn't deter us from returning to this fantastic restaurant again and again.",
    "I'm obsessed with my go-to blow bar, where the talented Natalie works her magic on my brows! As a brow specialist, she truly delivers - my eyebrows have never looked better! But the real game-changer was when I had the pleasure of getting a blowout from Victoria. I was blown away (pun intended!) by the incredible volume she achieved on my thin, straight, and lifeless locks. It was a total transformation! I've tried another stylist since, but no one compares to Victoria - she's my girl for life! And let's not forget the salon itself - it's a stunning, spotless oasis that makes you feel like royalty from the moment you step inside.",
    "This is my favorite cafe in the city. I love their black and white latte - it's not too sweet and has just the right amount of foam. Their soups are always delicious, even if you're not a big soup fan. The cafe is also very spacious, making it a great place to work. The noise level is just right, the music is not too loud, and I enjoy seeing customers bring their dogs. I'll definitely keep going back to this cafe as long as I can.",
    "Holy smokes! I was blown away by the actual pumpkin pie mixed into the frozen custard. It's unbelievable that this hasn't become a nationwide sensation yet! The best part? The chunks of pie crust scattered throughout - it was like finding a diamond inside another diamond. Super yummy!",
    "Upland Brewery, headquartered in Bloomington, Indiana, has garnered sufficient acclaim to warrant the establishment of additional locations throughout central Indiana. Their entire repertoire of beers is exceptional, and I must confess that their burgers and tenderloins have also earned my admiration. Consequently, I was eager to sample their pizza offerings, but unfortunately, they failed to meet my lofty expectations. The margherita pizza I ordered featured a crust reminiscent of a cracker, and its overall flavor profile was somewhat lacking. While the cheese was of high quality, the other toppings contributed little to the dish's flavor complexity. Notably, the absence of red sauce, a traditional component of a classic margherita pizza, was a significant omission. In my opinion, Upland's pizza may serve as a suitable accompaniment to a group gathering, but I will continue to opt for their burgers or tenderloins as my preferred meal choice during future visits.",
    "I had a great time at the show - a perfect way to unwind on a Friday night.",
    "This sushi spot is the only game in town, but it's a convenient lifesaver when you're in the mood for sushi and short on time. The standout star on their menu is undoubtedly the salmon, which we always make a point to order. Other favorites of ours include their spicy edamame, crispy tempura, refreshing ocean salad, and crunchy cabbage salad. Plus, the service is consistently friendly and efficient!",
    "I was torn between 3 and 4 stars for this location. As a huge fan of the 96th street Naked Tchopstix, I was excited to try this closer location. However, the vibe is distinctly different, with a greater emphasis on take-out and a smaller dining area. You order at the counter and they deliver your food. My daughter and I opted for the sushi bowl, which allows you to customize your meal by selecting proteins, vegetables, rice, and toppings on a paper menu. I appreciated the clarity of this system, but found the vegetable options to be limited and the rice-to-food ratio to be off. The sauces were a highlight, though. My husband's Maui roll, a favorite of mine from the 96th street location, didn't quite live up to the standard. While it was good, the quality and consistency were lacking. Despite this, I would return and think many people would enjoy the sushi bowls. I do want to address the negative reviews regarding service: this is a sushi restaurant, not a fast-food joint, so patience is required. As a healthy alternative to fast food in the area, the wait is worth it. On a separate note, the bubble tea is a must-try - I loved the strawberry flavor and plan to try the vanilla chai next time.",
    "I enjoyed a delicious lunch today! The beef brisket sandwich was outstanding, boasting incredible juiciness and tenderness. The pulled pork was equally impressive, matching the sandwich in flavor and quality.",
    "Hands down, the most amazing Thai food in the area! Every single dish was ridiculously authentic and mouth-wateringly delicious. I'm already counting down the days until I can go back and devour it all again... and again... and again!",
    "I was really disappointed with my dining experience. The service was poor and the food was just okay. I regret not choosing a different restaurant for my last dinner in town.",
    "I'm still raving about the dinner my wife and I had here over the weekend! The meal was seriously impressive. We were blown away by how fast our food arrived - it was like they knew we were starving! And the best part? Everything tasted like it was made from scratch, which we both loved. The only downside was deciding what to order, because let's be real, the menu was packed with way too many delicious options. We're already planning our next visit to try more dishes. Can't wait to see what the chef comes up with next!",
    "I'm giving this place two stars at least because the food was pretty decent. But, man, the service was a whole different story. I was there for a dinner meeting and we dropped $100 on apps and entrees, so you'd think they'd be on top of things. Nope. I had to track down the assistant cook (the dude in bright red baggy pants watching TV, btw) just to ask for more avocado on my tuna dish. And let me tell you, he made it super clear that he wasn't about to help me out. I had to flag down my waitress just so she could charge me an extra four bucks for the avocado. Ridiculous.",
    "I had the pleasure of dining at this establishment for the first time, and I must say it was an exceptional experience. Upon entering, I was struck by the warm and inviting atmosphere, reminiscent of being a guest in someone's home. The wait staff were not only courteous but also possessed a delightful sense of humor. The service was prompt, with our meals arriving in a timely manner. The cuisine was truly phenomenal, and I would highly recommend this restaurant. I certainly plan to return in the future.",
    "Enjoy delicious burgers, crispy fries, and fresh salads at this charming location! The burgers stand out with a perfect balance of salt and pepper flavor. The quaint atmosphere is enhanced by outdoor seating, making it a lovely spot to dine. The friendly staff adds to the welcoming vibe. Plus, parking is convenient with both street parking and a lot in the back.",
    "The exceptional staff at this establishment consistently provide outstanding assistance and exhibit a friendly demeanor. The store's impressive size and immaculate cleanliness create a welcoming atmosphere. Moreover, the inventory is always well-stocked with a wide range of essential items. The staff's willingness to accommodate special requests is particularly noteworthy, as they take the time to craft my custom breakfast bagel to perfection.",
    "I brought my vehicle to this shop a few years ago to address a manufacturer recall. After the repair, the initial problem was resolved, but I soon noticed a new noise that I thought was related. However, it turned out to be a separate issue altogether. To my surprise, Kevin and his mechanic not only diagnosed the problem but also fixed it free of charge, despite my offer to pay. I was impressed by their honesty and integrity. I highly recommend this shop and its outstanding team!",
    "Following my recent review of a different Sweet CeCe's location, I realized I had overlooked my local go-to spot. I must express my enthusiasm for their product - it's truly exceptional. The variety of toppings is also noteworthy, striking a great balance between healthy and indulgent options. While I've occasionally encountered minor service issues, such as inattentive staff or a need to remind them of promotions (like $5 Friday), my overall satisfaction with Sweet CeCe's cannot be overstated. As a result, I feel compelled to award it a minimum of 4 stars, reflecting my genuine appreciation for this establishment.",
    "Love this Funk Zone addition! Enjoy a bite and wine tastings next to the Santa Barbara Wine Collective (they share tables). The savory croissant is a must-try!",
    "Relaxing massage spot with easy same-day appointments. Never been disappointed with any therapist!",
    "We arrived at the Peppermill around 2:30 pm and were pleased to find that check-in was a breeze, complete with complimentary valet parking - a lovely touch. The resort's grandeur reminded us of Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, with its vast array of amenities. On site, we discovered eight restaurants catering to diverse tastes, and a casino area that rivaled those found in Las Vegas.\n\nHowever, we were surprised to find that many of the slot machines, advertised as \"penny machines,\" actually had minimum bets ranging from 30 cents to $5. This felt like false advertising to us.\n\nOur accommodations were located in the Tuscany Tower on the 12th floor, offering a stunning view of the expansive pool area. Our spacious room came equipped with free WiFi, a generous bathroom featuring a large shower with two shower heads, a TV, and a large jetted bathtub. The bathroom also boasted dual sinks, ample counter space, and a plentiful supply of towels. The main area was equally impressive, with a king-sized bed, nightstands, a closet, TV, mini fridge, dresser, safe, computer table, and three comfortable chairs and a table. To top it off, the thermostat maintained a comfortable temperature throughout our stay.\n\nThroughout our visit, we encountered courteous and helpful staff, making our stay at the Peppermill a truly enjoyable experience.",
    "As a busy professional, I'm always on the lookout for a reliable lunch spot that can deliver on quality and speed. Today, I convinced my boyfriend to try out a new deli with me, and I'm thrilled to report that it exceeded my expectations. The menu was overwhelming in the best possible way - with a vast array of options ranging from healthy salads and soups to comforting macaroni and hot food. I opted for a satisfying turkey, avocado, and bacon panini, while my boyfriend devoured a spicy buffalo chicken wrap. The best part? We didn't have to sacrifice our precious lunch hour waiting for our food. We'll definitely be back to explore more of what this deli has to offer.",
    "Get ready for a flavor explosion! Amazing biscuits and mouth-watering brunch dishes that will leave you craving for more! And to top it off, their craft cocktails are simply incredible! Highly, highly recommended - but be prepared for a lively atmosphere, as this hotspot can get pretty bustling!",
    "The food was good, and the atmosphere and decor resembled a cozy fishing lodge. The menu fell somewhere between Outback and Bonefish. We visited using a Groupon and were impressed that all three of our meals, as well as the calamari appetizer we ordered, were cooked to perfection. We will definitely be back!",
    "Honest Review: Hits and Misses\n\nLet's get straight to it - this place is budget-friendly, but unfortunately, you get what you pay for. The good news is that the price and location are convenient, and their desserts are a highlight! Some edible options include baked and fried chicken, mashed potatoes, a salad bar, a meat and cheese bar, ravioli, and pizza. Our waitress was also super friendly and attentive.\n\nOn the meh side, the behind-the-counter meat slicing station could use some improvement, and the shrimp (which weren't even deveined) and Mexican station were just okay.\n\nUnfortunately, there were some major misses. The breakfast options were a letdown, especially the eggs - they were honestly the worst I've ever had. The Eggs Benedict was also a disappointment, with ham and English muffins that were impossible to cut through. The steak and shrimp didn't impress either, and the breaded items were a no-go. To top it off, the decor felt like a blast from the past - think 1970s nightmare.\n\nAfter giving it three tries, I'm afraid I won't be back.",
    "I would have given this restaurant a 5-star rating if it weren't for one pretentious waiter who ruined our initial experience. As a guest at Hotel Palomar, the restaurant's location was a major plus. On our first night, we met for cocktails and took a seat at the bar since the host staff were busy. However, our waiter was less than welcoming, responding to our request to sit with an irritated tone and making us feel like an inconvenience. Despite this, we tried to make the best of it, but his distant demeanor and reluctance to accommodate our request to split the bill left a bad taste in our mouths.\n\nFortunately, we decided to give the restaurant another chance the following night, making sure to avoid our previous waiter. This time, we were greeted by a friendly bartender named Ben, who made us feel welcome and valued. He was knowledgeable, enthusiastic, and genuinely invested in our experience, recommending cocktails and sharing his expertise on whiskey. Ben exceeded our expectations and redeemed the restaurant from our previous poor experience.\n\nI also had the pleasure of ordering room service from the restaurant, which was exceptional. The bacon-wrapped dates and chocolate cake were outstanding. Overall, this is a great restaurant with amazing bartenders, but unfortunately, one bad waiter almost spoiled the experience.",
    "Dropped in after a leisurely Sunday morning stroll in the park and was delighted by the excellent food, coffee, and top-notch customer service. The atmosphere in here is absolutely wonderful!",
    "UNDERWHELMING EXPERIENCE! The excruciating wait for our food was only the beginning. The burger, ordered medium rare, arrived charred to a crisp - a culinary abomination. The Seafood Jumbalaya was the sole redeeming quality, but even that was merely decent. The hefty price tag was a slap in the face. With so many exceptional eateries in the French Quarter, this overhyped establishment failed to impress. It wasn't a complete disaster, but the hype surrounding this place was grossly overstated.",
    "This hidden gem exceeded my expectations in every way! The bed was incredibly comfortable, the breakfast was delicious, and the internet was lightning-fast. Plus, its prime location made exploring a breeze. And the best part? It was all at an unbeatable price. My only tip would be to request a lower floor if you're not a morning person, as the elevator wait times can be up to 15 minutes during peak hours. But overall, I was thoroughly impressed with this fantastic find!",
    "AVOID THIS PLACE LIKE THE PLAGUE! This so-called \"restaurant\" is a total joke. They only do one thing right - cooking food. Everything else? You're on your own, buddy! Thirsty? Get up and trek across the yard to grab a glass of water. Craving a drink? Take a hike up the stairs and fork over some cash. And don't even get me started on the \"dining area\" - a grimy yard with filthy lawn chairs. The wait staff? Barely helpful. They'll deign to bring you your food, but only after you've paid cash at the window. It's like a dirty, live-music-infused version of New Orleans Hamburger and Seafood. Trust me, once is enough. I'll never set foot in this dump again!",
    "Customization lovers, rejoice! This eatery is your playground, where every topping and condiment comes with a price tag. The food? Decent, but not exactly a flavor bomb. The real excitement lies in the à la carte adventure.\n\nOur journey began with a complimentary basket of chips and a side of tomato sauce, which I politely upgraded to something spicier and a dollop of pico de gallo. The salsa was a game-changer, but the real surprise came when I asked for a Coke and was presented with a bottle. When I requested a fountain drink, our server casually mentioned they only had Pepsi on tap. Who knew?\n\nWe ordered our meals, which were reasonably priced, but soon discovered that sour cream and cheese came with an extra fee. And if you want an extra basket of chips? That'll be $2.50, please.\n\nThe final bill was a shocker: we paid more for the fixin's than the food itself! A side of sour cream set us back $2, pico de gallo was $2.50, salsa was $2, chips were $2.50, and that unwanted bottled Coke? A whopping $5.\n\nMoral of the story: when you order, ask about those extra charges. Trust us, your wallet will thank you.",
    "The cafe was absolutely adorable. When we arrived at 8am, we were treated to a lovely surprise - a live jazz band performance. I opted for the breakfast sandwich, which was not only delicious but also cleverly presented, with rolled eggs and crispy bacon pieces tucked inside. The best part? It was a great value for a filling breakfast!",
    "This place is truly exceptional! I was initially drawn in by the promise of their famous duckfat French fries. For my son's birthday, we put our name in and waited about 45 minutes, enjoying a drink around the corner. We were seated at the bar, where we were greeted by Keith, the friendly and knowledgeable bartender. He was an all-around cool guy who knew his whiskeys inside out.\n\nWe started with three Cape May Salts (two for me, one for my son) and an order of tater tots, both of which exceeded my expectations. For dinner, I opted for the Kentucky Fried Quail, which was outstanding, although the succotash was slightly underwhelming. My son, on the other hand, indulged in the $24 Fois Gras burger, which was incredible and well worth the price. The duckfat fries were delicious, but surprisingly, not the highlight of the meal. I could have done without the cheese sauce, but since it was served on the side, it didn't detract from my overall experience.\n\nI'm already looking forward to returning to this restaurant with all my friends and family!",
    "Warning: Disappointment Ahead! Our recent visit to this establishment was a letdown from the start. The artichoke dip, a seemingly safe bet, arrived cold and was paired with stale chips. When we brought it to our waitress's attention, our concerns fell on deaf ears. The large thin-crust pizza we ordered was overpriced, especially considering the lackluster flavor. While our server was friendly, she failed to advocate for us when it mattered most. Having had a better experience here during a Cardinals game in the past, this visit was a stark contrast. Needless to say, we'll be taking our business (and appetites) elsewhere next time.",
    "For my fiancé's birthday, we opted for a casual Thai dinner at Jasmine Rice, a recommendation from Yelp. We initially wanted summer rolls, but they weren't available, so we settled for pan-fried dumplings instead. While the flavor was good, we wouldn't order them again. Our main courses, green curry fried rice with duck and chicken pad thai, were excellent. The duck was particularly impressive, being some of the tastiest I've ever had. The pad thai was a bit too sweet for our taste, but adding chili sauce improved it. Although our service was good, we noticed some issues with other tables, including a delayed meal for a group heading to the Kimmel Center and a missing item in a take-out order (which the owner kindly rectified). Overall, Jasmine Rice serves high-quality Thai food, and we'd definitely return.",
    "I'm obsessed with Courtney! She's literally the best hairstylist I've ever had the pleasure of sitting in her chair. What sets her apart is that she just gets me - she knows exactly what styles will make me look and feel amazing, and she's totally respectful of my boundaries. I love that I can just show up and be like, 'Hey, do your thing!' and trust that she'll work her magic. It's a total bonus that I don't have to spell out exactly what I want - she's got a keen eye for what needs to be done. Plus, she's super knowledgeable, has an awesome personality, and is just an all-around great human. If you want to look and feel your absolute best, Courtney is the stylist to see - trust me, you won't regret it!",
    "Discover a reliable and convenient solution for your car's needs at this trusted location! As a local resident, I've had the pleasure of frequenting this spot numerous times, and while it may not be the flashiest option, it consistently delivers when it counts. Whether you're due for an oil change or a state inspection, this place has got you covered. The secret to a seamless experience? Timing is everything - avoid peak hours and you'll be in and out in no time. Don't expect frills, but do expect solid, dependable service that gets the job done. A Pep Boys is a Pep Boys, but this one is a cut above the rest!",
    "Breathed new life into my home by swapping out two outdated 1970s Lennox units for two brand-new ones! The team did an outstanding job, and I'm thrilled to report that they've been humming along smoothly for three years now, providing reliable comfort and peace of mind.",
    "I highly recommend the Brewpub due to its diverse menu offerings, which include nachos, pizza, and sandwiches. Additionally, the establishment boasts an impressive selection of craft beers brewed on-site. While the service may be somewhat leisurely, I attribute this to the relaxed atmosphere of the restaurant. Rather than rushing through a meal, patrons can take advantage of the outdoor patio and enjoy the company of friends and family. The Brewpub is also an excellent choice for families with children and pets, as well as for individuals with vegetarian or vegan dietary preferences. Personally, I often opt for a half order of nachos or fish and chips. Furthermore, I was impressed by their seasonal Pumpkin Beer, which rivals some of my favorite pumpkin beers.",
    "Cozy home decor store with friendly staff who can help you decorate. Prices are affordable. We carry items from popular designers like Joanna Gaines (from the TV show Fixer Upper) and many more. It's a great home store in SB with prices that won't break the bank!",
    "I recently had a great experience at a local establishment with my brother. We stopped by to grab a six-pack of craft beers for a night in, but ended up staying for a few drinks and playing some classic Nintendo 64 games, including Super Smash Brothers, which was generously donated by fellow patrons. The atmosphere was warm and welcoming, with delicious food and genuinely friendly people. This place has all the makings of a Northeast staple and is definitely worth a visit.",
    "My go-to menu is coconut soup and pad thai with protein, which I decided to try here as well. I was pleasantly surprised by their coconut soup, which had just the right amount of coconut milk to make it rich and creamy without being overpowered by herbs. As someone who's accustomed to Americanized Thai cuisine, I prefer my dishes with less herbs, except for cilantro. The pad thai was also excellent, with a perfect balance of peanut flavor, chewy noodles, and just the right amount of sweetness. I was thrilled to receive a generous serving of chicken, and the white meat was juicy and not dry at all. Overall, I was very happy with my meal.",
    "I'm thoroughly impressed! This diner serves up fantastic comfort food and the best part - breakfast is available all day long! I stopped by for lunch and despite being busy, the staff were incredibly friendly and welcoming. Plus, it's conveniently located just off the 295, making it easy to get to.",
    "This bar has become my favorite spot to visit on Saturday nights. I was initially disappointed when Lucy's closed down, but I was pleasantly surprised to discover this new bar just across the street. The food here exceeds my expectations, and I always order their delicious wings and fries. Just be cautious when trying their 'WTF sauce'! One drawback is that it can take a while to get the bartender's attention, especially since the place is usually crowded. However, it's always exciting when the 'Always Sunny' crew stops by, making it a fun and lively atmosphere.",
    "Defying our initial skepticism about touristy eateries, we took a chance on the Shellfish Company on the Wharf, buoyed by its consistently stellar Yelp reviews. This small, popular spot requires advance planning, as waits are inevitable. We lucked out with a 20-minute wait, just as the dinner rush was subsiding. The real draw was the local rock crab special: 3 pounds of fresh California Rock Crab, paired with a generous salad and choice of soup or chowder, all for $25. The impressive presentation and generous portions of the salad and chowder combo set the tone for a fantastic meal. But the real star was the rock crab, which tasted as incredible as it looked. The juicy, buttery chunks of white crab meat were easily accessible, thanks to perfectly cooked shells that cracked open with ease. With an impressive amount of meat for minimal effort, this dish stole the show. We left thoroughly satisfied, convinced that ordering crab at the Shellfish Company is a safe bet and an exceptional value. In fact, it was one of the highlights of our trip.",
    "I strongly disagree with some of the negative reviews about Weaver's Way. This co-op isn't designed for quick, convenient shopping. As a single woman, I find it easy to shop here, even during peak hours. In fact, I appreciate that I can buy smaller quantities of items, which is perfect for someone living alone. I also enjoy the flexible work hours, which allow me to contribute to the community in various ways. The co-op's community is diverse and not just made up of stereotypical \"tree huggers.\" I value the opportunity to buy locally grown produce and natural, wholesome foods at prices lower than those at Whole Foods. I enjoy interacting with other members and contributing to my local and global community. While the membership fee and work hours may not be for everyone, I don't find them prohibitive as a single person. If you're committed to the co-op's values, it's an excellent place to shop. If not, you can always stick to chain stores or pay the visitor's fee to shop occasionally.",
    "While the food doesn't particularly impress me, many others rave about this place. I only go because my husband is a fan, personally I'd prefer to try a different BBQ joint. The experience may vary depending on your menu choices.",
    "I was surprised to find that the TV shows in my room were available for a fee of $4.99, and they included commercials. While I understand that hotels need to generate revenue, I felt that this approach was a bit unconventional. Additionally, I was disappointed to discover that breakfast was not included in the room rate, unlike many other hotels I've stayed at, including some more budget-friendly options in California. Instead, there was a buffet available for an extra charge.",
    "I highly recommend this shop, conveniently located near my hotel. The staff were exceptionally friendly and welcoming. The buy one get one deal is a fantastic offer that's hard to resist. I also tried their hot wings, which were delicious and generously sauced. I'll definitely be back for more pizza on my next visit to town!",
    "I'm obsessed with the cannolis at Termini Bros! They're made to order, so you know they're always fresh and delicious. The filling is absolutely amazing - it's got just the right amount of sweetness. Whether you're a cannoli lover or not, you've got to try one from Termini Bros. Trust me, you won't be disappointed!",
    "During our RV travels, we made a stop in Granite City and had the pleasure of discovering a charming café. Upon entering the establishment, we were warmly greeted by the friendly and courteous staff. The cuisine served was reminiscent of homemade cooking, and we were impressed by the freshness and flavor of our meals. We were so pleased with our experience that we returned for a second visit, and our food choices on both occasions were consistently delicious and comparable to a home-cooked meal.",
    "After spending three weeks exploring the local dining scene, I'm thrilled to have discovered a hidden gem off Magazine Street that lives up to its promise. The staff are warm and welcoming, and as a self-proclaimed Phò enthusiast, I can confidently say that their version is exceptional and definitely worth trying!",
    "We returned for breakfast and again, the food and service were impeccable. Highly recommend!",
    "Our kayaking tour on Santa Cruz Island was a huge success. My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed ourselves, thanks in large part to our excellent tour guide, Jen, who was both helpful and knowledgeable. The highlight of the tour was undoubtedly exploring the caves, which was an absolute blast. Despite having modest expectations, we were pleasantly surprised to find that the tour far exceeded them.",
    "Looking for a tasty meal that won't break the bank? You've got to try this place! The shrimp and goat cheese crepes are a game-changer - don't miss out!",
    "Get ready for a game-changing experience in the STL area! I'm embarrassed to admit that it took me over 10 years to discover this St. Louis staple, but now I'm hooked! This incredible destination is a must-visit for anyone looking for a unique adventure. Take a tour of the factory (Friday-Sunday, noon-5pm on the hour), explore the shop, bar, and dining area, and enjoy live music on the weekends. And don't worry about waiting - it's the perfect opportunity to soak up the atmosphere!\n\nThe beer? Absolutely phenomenal! As a non-beer enthusiast, I was blown away by the Hefeweizen - a perfect introduction for anyone looking to dip their toes into the world of craft brews. And the food? Homegrown and mouth-wateringly delicious! I devoured the pizza (a server recommendation) and my date raved about the bison burger.\n\nWhat really sets this place apart is the exceptional service and commitment to local quality. The staff is a talented team of free-spirited individuals who add to the venue's eclectic charm. Yes, it may be a bit pricier, but trust me, it's worth every penny. I'll be back again and again, and you should join me! Don't miss out on this STL tradition - get ready to experience the best!",
    "I'm extremely dissatisfied with my recent experience and would give it a zero rating if possible. I ordered a simple hamburger, but when I took two bites, I discovered it contained bacon, which I'm severely allergic to. I returned to the drive-through window to complain, but the staff member took the burger back without a word and disappeared. After an awkward two-minute wait, he returned and brusquely told me to go inside to collect my food. I did so, but still didn't receive an apology. This ordeal has left a bad taste in my mouth, and I won't be returning to this establishment. It's a shame, as it's convenient to have multiple dining options after DT. I guess I'll be sticking to Freebirds from now on!",
    "I'm very happy with my first visit. The car wash was great and the service was excellent. Thanks!",
    "I've been going to Sushi Nara since it opened this month and I'm a big fan. The restaurant is clean, the staff is friendly and accommodating, and the service is quick. The sushi is consistently delicious (I've been three times) and reasonably priced. In fact, my husband recently got takeout and paid only $24 for four sushi rolls. I appreciate the freshness of the food and the wide variety of options. If you're on the eastside, I highly recommend checking out Sushi Nara!",
    "Discover a hidden gem! This incredible shop is a treasure trove of hard-to-find tires and parts, curated by a passionate owner who's dedicated to his craft. With his expert knowledge and enthusiasm, you'll feel confident that you're in good hands. A must-visit for anyone seeking unique automotive solutions!",
    "I've had the pleasure of dining here numerous times, and my consistent verdict is that the cuisine is exceptional. Tucked away in Florissant, this eatery is a treasure trove, boasting the most delectable Panang curry in the area. Although I've yet to try their sister restaurant, I find myself reluctant to venture elsewhere, as the food here always leaves me thoroughly content and eager to return.",
    "While my recent dining experience didn't quite live up to my expectations, I'm willing to give this restaurant the benefit of the doubt - and an extra star - because I'm genuinely excited about their innovative menu and stylish concept. Unfortunately, my tomato-basil soup fell flat, tasting more like a bland marinara, and the tuna melt sandwich was overpowered by an intense citrus flavor that didn't quite work. However, I'm eager to give them another chance, particularly with their dishes featuring cured Italian meats like mortadella and prosciutto, which I'm confident will showcase their culinary skills. And let's not forget their tantalizing baked goods, especially the Nutella bruschetta - a must-try on my next visit!",
    "Underwhelming Experience: A Taste Bud Letdown! \n\nOur first and only visit to this eatery left us feeling disappointed and uninspired. The veggie pizza I ordered was a major letdown, with a lackluster tomato sauce that failed to impress and a measly amount of cheese that left me craving more. To make matters worse, the dough tasted like it was mass-produced by a machine, lacking that personal touch. While it's possible they've upped their game since our visit, we're not exactly champing at the bit to give them a second chance.",
    "So, a few friends and I decided to grab some late-night milkshakes and ended up at More Than Just Ice Cream. Yeah, we pretty much just got ice cream... didn't exactly live up to the name, but maybe next time, right? We got three milkshakes: coffee, chocolate, and black & white malt. They were all pretty solid. Definitely hit the spot for our ice cream cravings. I thought my coffee milkshake could've been thicker, and same with the chocolate. But the black & white was super thick and probably the winner of the three. Bummer I didn't order that one, so I was stuck with my not-so-creamy coffee. Before settling on a milkshake, I did try some of their ice cream flavors. The pumpkin pie was insane! I have no idea why I didn't just go with that. Maybe milkshakes aren't the way to go at this place...",
    "Celebrating a Century of Love: A Birthday to Remember!\n\nI still get goosebumps thinking about my husband and I taking my mom to this amazing spot for her 100th birthday! We were blown away by the exceptional treatment we received. From scoring a fantastic table with a stunning view, to savoring the chef's thoughtful complimentary dishes, to being wowed by the beautifully decorated cake plate - every detail exceeded our expectations. The warm and attentive servers made us feel like royalty. This unforgettable experience will be etched in our hearts forever, making my mom's milestone birthday truly unforgettable.",
    "I'm seriously impressed with this spot! The bartender was super friendly and knowledgeable. You gotta try the burger - it's made with fresh, locally-sourced ingredients and it's a game-changer. I saw some of the other dishes coming out of the kitchen and they looked incredible too. Plus, the beer is always ice-cold and the cocktails are expertly mixed. What I love most about this place is that it's a genuine local joint, not some chain restaurant. The staff is top-notch and you can tell they really care about what they're doing.",
    "I ended up visiting this restaurant four times during my five-day stay, which is a lot! Here's why I kept going back:\n\n* The restaurant was conveniently located near my hotel.\n* It had flexible hours, even on New Year's Day, which fit my schedule.\n* As a party of two, we were usually seated right away.\n* The price of $9 per dozen oysters was a great deal.\n* The adjacent seafood shop sold boiled and fresh seafood to-go.\n* Our server was friendly and recognized us every time we visited.\n\nHowever, I only gave the restaurant 3 stars because of some drawbacks:\n\n* Most of the dishes we tried were just average.\n* The raw oysters weren't cleaned well, so I'd recommend Superior Seafood's happy hour deal for better quality and cheaper oysters.\n* The turtle soup had a strange taste, and I prefer Felix's version.\n* Some of my boiled shrimp were mushy, possibly due to overcooking.\n* While the ambiance was inviting, it wasn't very comfortable, so we usually just ate and left.\n* The bathroom could use a good cleaning!\n\nDespite these issues, I might visit again if I'm in the area or need to grab some seafood quickly.",
    "Avoid this restaurant at all costs if you're looking for a decent dinner experience. Our server was completely incompetent, often leaving us wondering if she was even familiar with the layout of the restaurant. We had to repeatedly ask for basic necessities like utensils and water refills. To make matters worse, I ordered chicken parmesan but was served eggplant parmesan instead, which contained a fish bone. The only redeeming quality was the drinks, which were satisfactory.",
    "My experience at TDS was underwhelming, to say the least. The restaurant's ambiance was lacking, with no decorative touches, menu boards, or even proper dining tables - just stainless steel prep tables. The staff, though numerous, wore no identifying uniforms or name tags, adding to the impersonal atmosphere. While the food was reasonably priced and mostly enjoyable, the real disappointment came when we were charged extra for salsa. We had ordered a salsa trio, which included three small samples, and when my brother asked for more to accompany his tacos, we were told we'd have to purchase the trio again. This was particularly frustrating given our substantial order of tacos, burritos, guacamole, and drinks, totaling over $40. Despite the decent food, the lackluster atmosphere and nickel-and-diming over salsa make it unlikely that I'll return.",
    "I'm absolutely thrilled with our photos! We've had the pleasure of working with Angela Clifton Photography three times, and every single image has exceeded our expectations. Not only are the photos stunning, but we've also had an amazing time during each shoot. What's more, the prices are incredibly affordable, making the beautiful memories we've captured a treasured keepsake for years to come.",
    "I had a pleasant dining experience at a sidewalk table, savoring my fish dish. Although the prices were a bit steep, the food was delicious. If you're looking for a quieter outdoor dining spot in the French Quarter, I recommend checking out Side Street instead.",
    "The historic courthouse is a must-visit, boasting impressive artwork throughout its premises. One of its unique features is the spiral staircase, which adds a touch of whimsy to the building's architecture. From the 5th level, visitors can enjoy a panoramic view of the entire city. The tower clock room is a particular highlight, featuring an intricate system of mechanical gears that is truly astonishing. Note that prior appointment is required to access the clock room. With so much to explore, plan to spend at least 2-3 hours here to make the most of your visit.",
    "I had the pleasure of meeting Ann today, and I was thoroughly impressed. Not only was she extremely helpful and radiated positivity, but she also went above and beyond to ensure my first experience was exceptional. Her outstanding service has earned my loyalty, and I'll definitely be a regular customer from now on. Thank you, Ann!",
    "I just had the most amazing dining experience at this hidden gem! It was my first time trying it out, and I was blown away by the flavors and atmosphere. The combination dinner was a game-changer - the pad Thai was everything I dreamed it would be, and the coconut soup was a revelation! I'd never had it before, but now I'm hooked. The restaurant itself was a feast for the eyes, with stunning Thai decor and music that transported me to the streets of Bangkok. And the service? Absolutely top-notch! In a town with limited dining options, this place is a breath of fresh air. I've found my new go-to spot in Carp - can't wait to come back!",
    "I stumbled upon a hidden gem that instantly melted all my stress away! This laid-back haven is definitely earning a spot on my must-visit-again list. And the cherry on top? The talented artist who took the stage, serving up a refreshing blend of eclectic tunes - including a country twist on 'Let It Go' that left me grinning from ear to ear. What's not to adore about this place?",
    "Get ready for a jaw-dropping transformation! If you haven't visited the Smoothie King Center since its New Orleans Arena days, you're in for a thrilling surprise. This iconic venue has undergone a stunning makeover, and while the seats remain the same, everything else has been revitalized to impress. The real showstopper? A mouth-watering array of food options to tantalize every taste bud. Savor the significant upgrade in quality, a far cry from just a few years ago.

    "I was pleasantly surprised by this Indian restaurant in Tampa Bay, which exceeded my expectations in every way. The ambiance was lovely, complete with white table linens, and the food was truly exceptional. The chicken 65 was outstanding, and the hot sour soup was rich and full of flavor. Our waitress, Angel, provided friendly, attentive, and pleasant service. Despite only being open for a week, I'm confident that this restaurant will soon become a go-to destination for foodies seeking authentic Indian cuisine.",
    "It took me three trips to New Orleans to finally experience the magic of this iconic jazz venue. After waiting in line twice before, I learned my lesson and splurged on reserved seats this time around. The extra $20 was well worth it, as it allowed us to bypass the hour-long wait and support the preservation of jazz - a great cause. The show was absolutely fantastic, featuring talented musicians with great personalities. It felt like stepping back in time to the concerts of 50 years ago. The band members were stylish, engaging, and incredibly skilled. The intimate setting, which holds only around 200 people, added to the charm, allowing us to see the joy on the musicians' faces as they shared their craft with us. This is a must-do experience while in NOLA - don't hesitate to splurge and make it happen!",
    "WOW, What a Refreshing Experience!\n\nAs a new customer, I was blown away by the exceptional service I received at Keystone Discount Tire. With my original plans rained out and my dealership too busy to accommodate me, I was in a bind. But Keystone came to the rescue, fitting me in without an appointment and delivering a hassle-free PA State & Emissions inspection.\n\nI was a bit apprehensive, having heard horror stories about shady shops tacking on unnecessary extras. But Keystone's stellar Yelp reviews gave me confidence. And boy, was I impressed! While I sipped on a complimentary cup of coffee, their team worked efficiently to inspect my 2008 Pontiac Torrent.\n\nThe only time I was asked to intervene was to take a look at some minor outer front tire wear, which Bill, the friendly and knowledgeable technician, pointed out to me during the inspection. I appreciated his transparency and honesty - it was a simple issue that could be easily addressed with an alignment in the future.\n\nThe best part? My car was fully inspected and stickered in under an hour, without any surprise add-ons or inflated costs. Bill's straightforward analysis and friendly demeanor made the entire experience a breeze.\n\nIf you're looking for a trustworthy and customer-centric shop, look no further than Keystone Discount Tire. And don't forget to sign up for their mailing list to snag some amazing coupons!",
    "I'm still in awe - my son's phone was revived in under 30 minutes after a devastating drop! The expert technicians worked their magic with ease, providing top-notch service that left me beaming with delight.",
    "I was extremely disappointed with the service and management at this Cracker Barrel location. Despite messing up all four of our orders, the waiter became defensive and used inappropriate language when we brought it to his attention. The manager offered to comp our drinks, but it was too little, too late. The food was cold and unappetizing, and we ended up not finishing our meals after waiting over an hour for them to arrive. Unfortunately, this experience has left a bad taste in my mouth, and I will not be dining at Cracker Barrel again in the future.",
    "I've stayed at several dog-friendly hotels outside of the city, but I wasn't sure what to expect from one in the heart of the city. Typically, they're more like motels. As I walked into the Loews hotel lobby with my labrador/golden mix, Bentley, I felt a bit apprehensive - she's not exactly easy to hide. My boyfriend had assured me it was dog-friendly, but I was still uneasy as we approached the front desk to register.\n\nHowever, the receptionist immediately put us at ease with her warm welcome. As we checked in, an attendant even offered Bentley treats, which she thoroughly enjoyed. The receptionist also asked if we'd like a welcome kit for her, which included dog dishes, a mat, treats, and more. I was blown away by the thoughtfulness.\n\nThe other guests at the hotel were equally enthusiastic, stopping to compliment and pet \"queen Bentley\" as we made our way to our top-floor room. Even the car attendants greeted her by name when I took her for a walk. We were so impressed with the exceptional service that we decided to extend our stay an extra night. Thank you, Loews, for showing me that a hotel can truly be dog-friendly, even for a big dog like Bentley.",
    "I've had mixed experiences with this food. While it can be exceptional, the quality is inconsistent. I've been ordering the same dish for years, and it's a coin toss whether it will be incredible or not. It's as if they have different chefs in the kitchen, making it unpredictable. Unfortunately, it's only excellent about 50% of the time, which is frustrating.",
    "I've had the misfortune of visiting this location twice, and I can confidently say I will not be returning. My first experience was mediocre, but my second visit was utterly disappointing. I ordered ribs, which I had to send back not once, but twice, due to inconsistent temperatures. The first time, one half was warm and the other half was refrigerator cold. The second time, one side was scorching hot and the other side remained cold. It wasn't until the third attempt that my meal was finally edible. The manager did apologize, but failed to offer any compensation for the inconvenience. While I'm not one to make a scene in hopes of getting something for free, I was taken aback by the lack of sincerity in their apology. After having to send my food back three times just to get it cooked properly, I felt compelled to share my disappointing experience in this review.",
    "Ramen Rendezvous: A Tale of Two Tastes\n\nAfter indulging in a ramen revelry at various hotspots, I landed at Cheu with sky-high expectations. Alas, my bowl didn't quite live up to the hype. The thick, chunky noodles and salty broth just didn't harmonize with my taste buds. But, as they say, 'to each their own' - my friend, a Cheu regular, was absolutely smitten!\n\nThe silver lining? Exceptional service and a craft beer selection that's sure to please even the most discerning palates. Perhaps I'm just a ramen rebel, but I'm eager for others to form their own opinions. Who knows, you might just find your new favorite haunt!",
    "Two new concessions have been added to the ballpark. Federal Doughnuts offers doughnuts and fried chicken. Additionally, a gluten-free concession stand near section 136 is now available, serving pizza, cheesesteaks, brownies, and cookies.",
    "I'm thrilled to discover a new Red Kings restaurant in Chinatown, which has just opened its doors yesterday! It's unclear whether this location is replacing the existing one down the street or if it's an additional outlet serving up more of their signature spicy Szechuan cuisine. I opted for takeout and tried the Dan Dan Noodles and shredded Pork in Garlic sauce, both of which boasted a perfect balance of heat and flavor. The spice level was intense, but complemented by sweet, earthy, and fresh notes. The generous portions will provide plenty of leftovers, and I'm eager to explore more of the menu and return for a sit-down dinner. As an added bonus, the restaurant features karaoke rooms upstairs and allows BYOB (bring your own bottle).",
    "I've never seen a Chick-fil-A as slammed as this one, but somehow they always manage to crank out orders at lightning speed while still delivering top-notch service. I'm seriously blown away by how they can consistently pull it off! This place has definitely earned a spot as one of my all-time faves.",
    "This charming eatery is a haven for salad lovers! Whenever I'm in town, I make it a point to stop by for a delightful lunch. The service is impressively swift, and the vibrant veggies are always bursting with freshness.",
    "On September 26th, 2015, my parents and I embarked on an unforgettable adventure with the Oak Alley and Laura Plantation tour. Our knowledgeable driver, whose expertise added depth to our journey, transported us to these historic gems. The meticulously planned schedule allowed for the perfect balance of guided exploration and free time to wander the stunning properties at our own pace. Plus, the flexible drop-off locations on the return drive were a bonus, enabling us to disembark near Jackson Square and indulge in the vibrant atmosphere of the French Quarter for the rest of the afternoon.",
    "Brunch lovers, rejoice! We've had the pleasure of dining at this gem not once, but twice, and each experience has been an absolute delight! Every dish we've tried has been a flavor sensation, with the creamy grits infused with scallions and sour cream being a standout star. But, be warned: the room can get chilly, so don't forget to bundle up with a cozy sweater to ensure a comfortable and enjoyable meal!",
    "I highly recommend this establishment for its exceptional hot dogs and chili dogs, which are unparalleled in the area. I'm a frequent customer and always look forward to savoring their delicious offerings.",
    "Discover the Ultimate Hangout Spot at the Waterline! I recently spent a Saturday evening here with friends, grooving to live music and savoring the best local beer in town - hands down! The vibe is a cut above Fig Mountain, and I'm obsessed with Topa's unique charm. But what really takes it to the next level is the seamless experience with the Nook Restaurant and Lama Dog, just steps away. Imagine indulging in mouth-watering eats and then strolling into a trendy taproom - it's a game-changer! I'm hooked on the Waterline and can't wait to go back!",
    "I am delighted to report that our experience with this company's customer service was exceptional. Although our location was slightly outside their designated pickup area, they were more than willing to accommodate our group of seven and arranged for transportation to their facility. Upon arrival, we discovered an error on our invoice, as we were charged for eight individuals instead of seven. I promptly contacted their customer service department, and they rectified the issue by refunding the excess amount in a timely manner. The tour itself was an absolute delight! Our group thoroughly enjoyed the experience, thanks in large part to our humorous and engaging tour guide. We had the opportunity to observe numerous alligators, ranging from infant specimens swimming in the water to fully grown adults. Additionally, we spotted turtles and various bird species during the tour. A highlight of the experience was the chance to hold a baby alligator, which our guide is currently caring for until it reaches a suitable size for release. The return journey was equally enjoyable, as our guide operated the boat at a thrilling pace and even performed some impressive maneuvers. I highly recommend this tour to anyone seeking a fun and memorable experience.",
    "In April, Westfall expertly replaced our roof, and we couldn't be more thrilled with the entire experience. From the high-quality roof they installed to their exceptional communication and diligent follow-up, every aspect of the process exceeded our expectations. We're absolutely delighted that we chose Westfall for the job!",
    "This establishment offers delectable cuisine at a moderate price point, complemented by a courteous and attentive staff. While the dining area may not be conducive to a leisurely meal, it's understandable given their focus on providing quick, high-quality vegan options. Although the buffalo bella is heavily promoted, I personally recommend the Cheesesteak, which is a standout dish in my opinion. Additionally, I would suggest augmenting your meal with an order of sweet potato fries - a delightful accompaniment that elevates the overall dining experience.",
    "The ramen at this establishment is satisfactory, although it does not exceed expectations. The service is also adequate. While it may not be a top choice, it is a convenient option for a quick meal. Having visited this location twice, I intend to continue patronizing it in the future.",
    "A culinary experience that caters to diverse palates! This eatery boasts a clean, trendy ambiance and serves delectable dishes that are sure to delight. To avoid lengthy wait times, I recommend arriving prior to 9 am, as the crowds tend to swell thereafter. However, I assure you that the wait is well worth it. You'll depart feeling utterly satiated and thoroughly impressed.",
    "I highly recommend the $9.99 brisket sandwich meal, which comes with two sides and a drink. The barbecue is great and the price is unbeatable. The side options are delicious, including potato casserole, creamed spinach, baked beans, and green beans.",
    "The restaurant exceeded my expectations with its delicious food and excellent service. However, I would have liked to see more vegetarian and vegan options on the menu. Despite this, I'm already looking forward to my next visit!",
    "The restaurant serves excellent cuisine, but unfortunately, the customer service is subpar. After visiting three times, I've had the misfortune of being served by two unfriendly older waitresses. However, the owner is a bright spot, being very kind and welcoming.",
    "Discovery of the Day: Nashville's Hidden Breakfast Gem!\n\nAs I soared through the skies en route to Music City, a chance conversation with a Franklin local led me to a game-changing breakfast spot. His enthusiastic recommendation to brave the line was all I needed to convince me to give it a try. And, oh boy, am I glad I did!\n\nNot only did we dodge the crowds, but our waitress revealed we'd lucked out by missing the morning rush. The real magic happened when my plate arrived, featuring a show-stopping corn pancake loaded with crispy bacon, zesty salsa, and a dollop of creamy sour cream. It was love at first bite!\n\nThis Nashville gem has earned a permanent spot on my Southern itinerary. If you're a breakfast aficionado like me, do yourself a favor and add it to your must-try list. Trust me, you won't regret it!",
    "I'm still in shock about our recent experience with a detailing service! My husband and I were really looking forward to getting our car detailed, so he booked an appointment with Michael for the following Saturday. To confirm, he even called again on Friday to make sure everything was set. But when we arrived at the workshop the next day, we were surprised to find out that Michael didn't have us down for a full detailing service, even though we had specifically discussed it. He suggested we come back the following Saturday instead, so we agreed.\n\nWe arrived bright and early at 8am the next week, but to our surprise, the workshop was closed! We tried calling Michael, but he said he was busy and would call us back. We waited for half an hour, but there was no call. We decided to grab some breakfast and came back at 9:30am, hoping to give him another chance. That's when Alex, his partner, finally opened the shop. Unfortunately, Michael was still nowhere to be found, and Alex couldn't reach him either. We were really disappointed and decided to cancel our appointment. It was a frustrating experience, but we're hoping to find a better service elsewhere.",
    "I recently had a complex relocation experience that necessitated additional support from this office. I was impressed by the exceptional service provided by the team, who demonstrated a high level of professionalism and integrity. They went to great lengths to ensure my needs were met, and I am grateful for their dedication. I would highly recommend this office to anyone, including family and friends, and have the utmost confidence in their ability to deliver outstanding results.",
    "During our girls' getaway to New Orleans last year, we had the pleasure of staying at The Saint, a hotel that initially impressed us with its stunning lobby, trendy bar, and restaurant that exuded a sophisticated ambiance. The warm and inviting atmosphere, coupled with the friendly staff, set the tone for what promised to be an unforgettable weekend. I arrived a few hours prior to my friend's arrival, as I had a substantial amount of work to attend to. I settled into my room, ordered room service, and spent the next four hours productively working on my laptop. After completing my tasks, I took a break to purchase a bottle of wine and treat myself to a manicure and pedicure. Upon my friend's arrival, we were ready to take on the city, and our evening began with a delightful dinner outing. However, our merriment was short-lived, as we soon discovered a massive flying cockroach in our room. I was horrified and promptly marched down to the front desk to report the issue. The staff assured me that they would send a maintenance worker to address the problem, but I was adamant that this was not a sufficient solution, as I suspected that there might be other unwanted critters lurking in the shadows. To my dismay, the new room they provided was also infested with small spiders and dead insects in the window corners, and to make matters worse, the TV was malfunctioning, and one of the lamps was without bulbs. It was now around 3 am, and I had reached my breaking point. I promptly booked a room at my trusted go-to hotel, The W, for the remainder of our trip. The next morning, I demanded to speak with a manager, and a young gentleman apologized for the inconvenience. I thanked him for his apology and requested a full refund, which he graciously provided. He also extended an invitation for us to return to The Saint once they had implemented changes, but I politely declined, still shaken by our unpleasant experience.",

    "I was really disappointed with my experience at this spot. The bouncer could've been more welcoming, and it felt like they were taking advantage of their Broadway location to overcharge and treat customers poorly. As a local, I was expecting more. Unfortunately, I won't be back and wouldn't recommend it to others.",
    "Wow, what a lunchtime treat! My girlfriend and I dropped by for a bite, and we were blown away by the sparkling cleanliness of the place. But the real star of the show was the food - absolutely phenomenal! And the best part? It won't break the bank! We can't wait to go back and indulge in another delicious meal!",
    "I've been a loyal customer for years, but my recent visit was a letdown. The food quality has taken a noticeable dip. We started with an artichoke that seemed to have been prepared ahead of time, which resulted in a cold center despite being cooked through. The Greek salad my wife ordered was also a miss, with pre-packaged ingredients and an overabundance of flavorless dressing. Unfortunately, my grilled yellowtail was the biggest disappointment - it was overcooked and tasted like low-quality frozen fish, which is unacceptable for a restaurant of this caliber. While the setting and service were still pleasant, the subpar food overshadowed the positives. I hope the kitchen can revamp their dishes to restore this establishment to its former glory. With a little improvement, it could regain its status as a local gem.",

It's the perfect sneak peek at the deliciousness to come!\n\nMilktooth's menu is always evolving, but some fan favorites stay put, with seasonal ingredient swaps to keep things fresh. Their Dutch pancake variations are a must-try, and the raclette grilled cheese is absolute perfection. If you're feeling extra festive, don't miss the michelada - and if the weather's nice, snag a seat outside to soak up the sunshine!",
    "We recently stayed at this hotel and had a fantastic experience, thanks to the amazing bar and staff! As a special touch, we were upgraded to a room with a stunning view since we were celebrating our honeymoon. However, despite the lovely view, the room itself was nothing out of the ordinary - comparable to a Hilton. We did notice some rust on the tub floor and strange stains on the tile, but these issues were limited to the bathroom.\n\nDespite these minor flaws, I'd still give the hotel 4 stars due to the exceptional staff. One thing to note is that the valet parking was a bit pricey, so we opted to park a couple of streets down instead. If you're looking to stay in the heart of downtown St. Louis, surrounded by cool bars and restaurants, I'd definitely recommend this hotel. Friday nights are especially lively in the area!",
    "Discovering a Hidden Gem: My Uplifting Experience at the Studio!\n\nI stepped into the beginner's class at this studio, and it was love at first move! The pace was spot on, challenging me just enough to uncover hidden flexibility in unexpected places. I was thrilled to find myself breaking a sweat, and the rush of endorphins left me feeling amazing afterwards. The cherry on top? The studio's sparkling cleanliness and the convenient option to grab some healthy Beyond Organic goodies on my way out.",
    "We finally found this great place! We were going to go to a chain lobster restaurant, but we wanted something more real and local. A friend told us about Lobster Haven, so I checked it online. It looked like the kind of place we like to eat at when we visit our family in Massachusetts. We loved it! The service was great, fast, and super friendly. They had a huge selection of all our favorite seafood dishes. If you want real New England seafood, you have to try this place! Plus, you can even buy live lobsters and fresh seafood to take home and cook yourself.",
    "I'm thoroughly impressed with this establishment! They offer an exceptional happy hour experience, a constantly updated menu featuring fresh and exciting options, and their craft drinks are truly delicious. If I had the opportunity, I would make it a point to visit this place daily, it's that good!",
    "I'm obsessed with Men's Clubs - it's the ultimate game-changer! Every single barber is a master of their craft, guaranteed to leave you looking and feeling like a million bucks. I've been a loyal customer for three years now, and I've never had a single complaint. Okay, okay, there was that one time when some shady character tried to rip off my signature style. But Tim, the hero of the hour, shut it down with a refreshing dose of honesty: \"Sorry, buddy, I can't replicate Ryan's magic.\" Thanks, Tim, for keeping it real and keeping my hair on point!",
    "My husband and I are regulars here, and for good reason. The food is consistently fresh and expertly prepared, and the service is always top-notch. If you're a sushi and hibachi lover like us, we can't recommend this place enough - it's a must-try!",
    "Chickie's and Pete's is the ultimate spot to catch a game and indulge in delicious food and drinks. While the cuisine may not be the best I've ever had, the overall experience is unbeatable. If you can snag a seat, be sure to order the mussels red, crab fries, and a cold beer - it's a winning combination. My personal favorites include the crab fries, mussels red (the white variety can be overpowering with garlic), spicy pull and peel shrimp, steamers, and blue crabs (if you're up for the challenge). I appreciate how the restaurant makes it easy to get messy and enjoy your food without worrying about the aftermath, thanks to the conveniently located sinks.\n\nIn short, Chickie's and Pete's is a beloved Philadelphia institution that guarantees a good time. I highly recommend visiting at least once to experience it for yourself. Just keep in mind two important things before heading there during major sporting events: be prepared to wait for a table, and be tolerant of the lively (and sometimes rowdy) atmosphere. Trust me, I've been there too - and it's all part of the fun!",
    "I received prompt and professional service on a Saturday, which was impressive. The task was a simple mirror repair, but the team made it a seamless experience for me. I've had the pleasure of using their services in Charlotte before, and they consistently deliver great results.",
    "I recently dined at Union Station in St. Louis and had a positive experience. I opted for the Ponchartrain, which my server informed me was identical to Tilapia, despite both options being listed on the menu - a curious decision. The dish itself was delicious, featuring mushrooms and a rich cream sauce. We also ordered the shrimp cocktail and lump crab cake appetizers, which were decent but not exceptional. The drinks and service were satisfactory. We took advantage of the pleasant weather and dined on the patio, but the interior of the restaurant looked cozy and slightly more formal.",
    "I recently visited this trendy spot for a drink and was blown away by the ambiance. The concept is truly one-of-a-kind in St. Pete, and the attention to detail in the remodel is impressive. You'll feel like you're stepping into a scene from a fantasy novel, complete with subtle background music that allows for easy conversation. The bartenders, Michael and Peggy, were warm and engaging, making the experience even more enjoyable. Although I didn't try the food this time, the prices for their meat and cheese trays seem very reasonable compared to similar establishments in the area. I'm looking forward to returning to try their menu and would highly recommend this spot to anyone looking for a unique and welcoming atmosphere.",
    "I'm absolutely thrilled with Maple Street Patisserie! This bakery has never failed to impress me. In fact, their blueberry muffin is the best I've ever had the pleasure of trying. Whether you're in the mood for a delicious breakfast or lunch, this spot is a must-visit. Plus, they offer specialty cakes, including king cakes during Mardi Gras season. What really sets them apart, though, is the owner, Ziggy, who works tirelessly to create these mouthwatering treats. His dedication is truly admirable. Overall, I highly recommend Maple Street Patisserie - you won't be disappointed!",
    "I enjoyed the Bourbon Black and Bleu burger, cooked to my liking and very flavorful. However, our large party of 9 had to wait over an hour for our food, which was unacceptable. Despite this, I'd recommend the burger, but they need to improve their service speed.",
    "Whenever we have visitors from out of town, we always take them to Katie's. The food is amazing and there's a lot to choose from. Plus, it's affordable and delicious! You can't go wrong with their grilled oysters, shrimp and grits, Cuban sandwich, pizza, or soup and salad. They also have daily specials that feature local and seasonal ingredients. The staff is friendly and welcoming. Just be aware that Sundays can get busy after church, but you can always grab a drink and enjoy their bottomless Mimosas while you wait!",
    "After attending the Zurich Classic golf tournament, I stopped by Creole Creamery for a refreshing treat. The warm and humid weather made an ice cream cone the perfect choice. I was lucky to find street parking and was impressed by the cozy interior. The massive flavor selection was overwhelming, but after trying a few unique options, I opted for a scoop of cookie monster ice cream on a cone. The ice cream was a hit - not too sweet and totally satisfying. I highly recommend checking out Creole Creamery!",
    "I'm absolutely obsessed with this place! As a regular customer for the past few years, I can confidently say it's a hidden gem. While it may not be the most conventional spot, with a quirky atmosphere that might not appeal to everyone, it truly shines when it comes to its extensive Saki selection, mouth-watering rolls, and generous portions of rice and Sashimi. The vibrant, youthful energy is palpable, with loud dance music setting the tone for a lively night out. If you're a Saki enthusiast like myself, this is the ultimate destination!",
    "We highly recommend this place - every dish we've tried has been a hit! The Backyard Bowl is our top pick so far, but we're excited to try more. The portions are generous, and we're always satisfied with a kids' size or a shared large. The high-quality ingredients make for filling meals at a reasonable price. Be prepared for a wait, especially during peak hours, but trust us, it's worth it.",
    "The service was a bit unusual, as our server was new to the job. However, the food presentation was a highlight - it looked great. One area for improvement was the gumbo, which could have used either a side of rice or a more generous serving of potato salad. On a separate note, the Sprite I ordered was flat, but fortunately, I didn't end up needing it anyway.",
    "This pancake spot is a solid choice, but it can get a bit chaotic when it's slammed with customers. The pancakes themselves are tasty, but be prepared for a sugar rush - they're extremely sweet. On the plus side, the prices are reasonable. One major advantage is that they serve breakfast all day, which is a definite perk. However, there's nothing particularly unique or standout about the menu that you can't find elsewhere.",
    "Discovering hidden gems has never been so exciting! The amazing staff made our shopping experience truly unforgettable. We can't wait to come back and uncover more treasures!",
    "I've been a loyal customer since childhood, and now I'm proud to bring my own kids here. The staff has been like family, watching us grow up over the years. They're not only friendly and personable but also incredibly efficient with their service. Special shoutout to Yoli and Frank - they're the epitome of excellence! The food is simply amazing, with the shredded beef burro and cheese crisp being my absolute favorites. In my opinion, this place serves up genuinely authentic Mexican cuisine.",
    "I would give this restaurant 2 stars for dining in. The service was disappointing and the venue was subpar. The food was average, but if I had gotten takeout, I might have given it 3 stars. I ordered the lamb kebab, which was just okay. It was very plain, with no sauces, lettuce, or other toppings - just the meat.",
    "This Middle Eastern restaurant is a standout in the area, consistently serving exceptional cuisine that never fails to impress. The quality of their dishes is unparalleled, and I always leave feeling satisfied and delighted.",
    "I am astonished that anyone would rate this establishment with only one star. Allow me to share my experience. In my opinion, they offer the superior cannoli in the city. Termini's and Isgro's, while well-known, do not come close to matching the quality of Potito's. As a result, Potito's has become my go-to destination for cannoli, and I wouldn't consider visiting anywhere else. I make it a point to visit every Christmas Eve, and I intend to continue this tradition for years to come. This year, I waited in line for two hours at Isgro's for a tiramisu, whereas I was able to walk into Potito's and promptly purchase my preferred Bambino cannoli stuffed cannoli. I assure you, it is every bit as delightful as it sounds.",
    "I'm absolutely thrilled to rave about this hidden gem of an eatery! As someone who grew up surrounded by authentic Mexican cuisine in the Texas panhandle, I've been on a lifelong quest to find restaurants that live up to my high standards. And let me tell you, El Limon is the crème de la crème of Mexican restaurants in Pennsylvania! Their menu boasts an impressive array of mouthwatering dishes, from sopes and tostadas to enchiladas, fajitas, burritos, and fish tacos - each one expertly prepared and ridiculously affordable. The waitstaff is always warm, welcoming, and attentive, making every visit a true delight. But what truly sets El Limon apart are its two standout features: their heavenly homemade tamales and complimentary margaritas! Whether you're a foodie, a family, or just looking for a fantastic dining experience, El Limon is the perfect destination for an unforgettable Mexican feast. ¡Olé!",
    "I'm awarding this establishment 4 stars, with the potential to reach 5-star excellence once they iron out a few wrinkles. As a frequent visitor to the area, I've had the opportunity to dine here multiple times, and I'm confident that the minor issues I've encountered will be resolved as they continue to refine their operations. The staff is more than willing to make amends when mistakes occur, which is a testament to their commitment to customer satisfaction.\n\nThe food, overall, is exceptional. While some reviewers have raved about the pizza, I found it to be somewhat lacking, with a greasy texture and a cheese blend that may not be 100% mozzarella. However, the other dishes I've tried have been outstanding:\n\n* The Quaker (chicken version) is a highlight, with chunky chicken, perfectly melted cheese, and fresh vegetables. A bit more seasoning on the chicken would elevate it to perfection.\n* The fries are crispy and flavorful, with no need for ketchup.\n* The onion rings are crispy and delicious, with a minimal amount of grease.\n* The spanakopita was slightly overcooked, but the flavors were excellent.\n* The baklava is a standout, with a perfect balance of sweet and savory.\n* The Signature Salad features incredibly fresh vegetables and a tangy balsamic dressing.\n* The (turkey) Greek Burger is one of the best I've ever had, with a moist and flavorful patty, topped with a delectable homemade tzatziki sauce. The fresh romaine lettuce and absence of feta were minor deviations from the menu, but the sauce more than made up for it.\n\nOverall, this establishment has tremendous potential and is already serving up high-quality dishes. If they maintain their standards, I'll be a regular customer.",
    "**Planet Fitness: A Great Value with 24/7 Access**\n\nPlanet Fitness stands out with its 24-hour operation, earning it a 4-star rating. If you're on a budget, it's the cheapest option that offers the best value for your money. For just $20.00 a month, you'll have access to a range of amenities, including tanning beds, massage chairs, and a sculpt machine.\n\n**Note:** The $9.99 membership option is available, but it comes with some limitations, such as no guest privileges.\n\nDespite the lack of motivation from bodybuilders, the gym is still a great choice. The staff is consistently polite and helpful, making it a welcoming environment for everyone.",
    "Extremely let down. We arrived at 2:15 pm on Saturday to grab a bite, only to be informed that the kitchen had already closed at 2 pm. This was a surprise, given their website explicitly states they're open all day on Saturdays and Sundays until 5 pm. I'm always skeptical of establishments that can't get basic details like their hours correct online. It raises concerns about their attention to quality and other important details.",
    "I'm super impressed with these guys! They're total pros - they get the job done on schedule and stand behind their work with a warranty. If you need something done, I'd definitely give them a shout!",
    "I'm hooked on this place! I make it a point to dine here at least twice a week, and every time I'm blown away by the exceptional service - the servers are always beaming with friendly smiles. The food? Absolutely incredible! I've never left feeling anything less than completely satisfied, with a full stomach and a heart full of joy.",
    "Hidden Gem Alert! We stumbled upon the transformed Carrow's Restaurant on Plumb and Kietzke, and it's a real treasure! This former gem was saved from demolition by its stunning redwood beams and fascia, and now it's serving up culinary masterpieces. The food was nothing short of phenomenal! My wife devoured the tri-tip salad, with its perfectly balanced balsamic vinaigrette, tender medium-rare tri-tip, and crispy potato \"croutons\" that added a delightful textural twist. I opted for the tri-tip, chicken, and combo, paired with the fresh corn salad and creamy potato salad - every bite was pure bliss! We were so impressed that we indulged in dessert, a rare treat for us. The lemon meringue pie stole the show, with its silky, golden-brown meringue that melted in our mouths. And the best part? The prices were incredibly reasonable for the exceptional quality and ambiance. We've already raved about it to our friends and family, and we can't wait to return for another unforgettable dining experience. Kudos to the chef and team - you've truly outdone yourselves!",
    "I didn't have the pleasure of having Rebecca as my doula during my birth, but I did have the privilege of having her as our nanny for our firstborn daughter. As she spent more time in our home, I looked forward to our conversations before and after work. As an expectant mom pregnant with my second child, I found her insights and suggestions to be incredibly valuable. Rebecca is not only easy to talk to, but also honest and truthful - a quality I truly appreciate. Her passion for her role as a doula shines through, and she has a deep respect for the strength and beauty of the labor process. I highly recommend having Rebecca on your support team - she would be a wonderful addition!",
    "I recently had my car tinted at Orange Tint and Tune and received exceptional service. The shop offers a convenient car pick-up service for customers within a 4-mile radius. My technician, Carlos, took the time to explain all the tint options and even adjusted the grade to achieve the look I wanted. The receptionist was friendly, and the owner, Dustin, followed up to ensure I was satisfied with the service. Overall, I highly recommend Orange Tint and Tune and give them 5 stars for their outstanding customer care.",
    "I stayed at this TownePlace Suites for three nights on business and had a pleasant experience. The hotel's proximity to the airport is convenient, yet surprisingly quiet. The rooms are standard TownePlace Suites fare, equipped with a refrigerator, stove, and other amenities. The surrounding area is quiet, with a mix of hotels and office buildings, and is about a 20-minute drive from downtown or the university area. The Pima Air Museum is just a 5-10 minute drive away. While dining options are limited, there are some fast food choices and a great sandwich shop called Baggins within walking distance. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful, and the breakfast offered a standard continental spread with a few hot options. They also host a weekday evening reception, which could be a decent substitute for dinner if you arrive early. My only suggestion for improvement is that they should restock the food and drinks more frequently during the reception, as options ran out quickly. Overall, the rooms are comfortable, the beds are cozy, and the area feels safe.",
    "Detour Delight: Discovering a Hidden Gem in Tampa!\n\nA unexpected diversion to Tampa turned into a culinary adventure when we stumbled upon a local treasure, thanks to Yelp's expert guidance. We dodged the chain restaurants and opted for an authentic experience, and boy, are we glad we did!\n\nThe ladies indulged in the tender 7 oz. Tampa strip, while the gentlemen devoured the massive 14 oz. ribeye. The real magic happened when we discovered they grill their steaks over oak and citrus wood, infusing them with a smoky flavor that's simply sublime! As fellow wood-smoke enthusiasts, we were thrilled to find a kindred spirit in this kitchen. It's a rare find, indeed, and well worth the detour!\n\nSides of fresh veggies and sweet potatoes complemented our meals perfectly. And the wine list? A refreshing surprise! Most bottles were under $20, with a thoughtful selection that didn't break the bank. No outrageous markups here!\n\nOur wonderful waitress, Lisa, offered spot-on recommendations and treated us to warm, friendly service that made us feel right at home. We're so grateful we took a chance on this local gem instead of settling for a chain. This hidden gem is now firmly bookmarked for our next Tampa visit. Don't miss out on this incredible find!",
    "After my initial review, the owner of this location (who also owns two other locations, including one in Southampton) personally reached out to me. We had a lengthy conversation that lasted about 30 minutes, and I was thoroughly impressed by his business approach. He's exactly the kind of person I'd want to do business with. I decided to give Saladworks another chance, visiting twice more, and was pleased to find that the service had significantly improved. The new summer salads are a particular highlight - they're absolutely delicious!",
    "This deli is the best I've encountered in the entire US, offering a wide variety of unique options that make it difficult to decide. The Muffalata sandwich is enormous, easily shareable among four people, and is incredibly flavorful and delicious. I recommend visiting on Saturday or Thursday evenings when they feature live music. The daily special is always a good choice, and there are plenty of sides to select from, including excellent chili, potato salad, and chips. Don't hesitate - go now and experience it for yourself!",
    "As my dad and I embarked on our epic cross-country adventure, our inaugural stop was the breathtaking Saguaro National Park. We were fortunate to join a guided tour led by the incomparable Park Ranger Carolyn, whose infectious enthusiasm and vast knowledge of the iconic saguaro cacti left us in awe. Her passion for her work was palpable, making the experience truly unforgettable. If you're planning a visit, I highly recommend joining one of Carolyn's tours - you won't be disappointed!",
    "So I checked out this spot after my hubby brought home their insane lemon pepper wings. They've got a ton of flavors to choose from - you know, the usual suspects like lemon pepper and mild, but also some more unique ones like yaka mein and noonie bird, which are inspired by New Orleans. And don't even get me started on their drinks! The watermelon flavor is literally amazing... I have no idea what kind of magic they're using, but it's a game-changer. The location could be better, but you can tell they're really trying to give back to the community. It's near the daiquiri shop, so it's not so bad during the day. I might not venture out there alone at night, though. Anyway, def give this place a shot - and you might even run into Skip!",
    "Hey there! I'm back at Tom Jones and I've got an update for you! I noticed that weird ATM machine that only lets you take out cash to pay for your meal is gone - it used to be near the restrooms. But don't worry, there's still a payphone back there, and I'm obsessed with it! Now, there are ATMs at the front entrance, so that's convenient.\n\nThe blue ribbon deal is still a steal at $3.79 - you get pancakes, 2 eggs, toast, sausage, bacon, juice, and coffee! My kids and I went there recently, and my daughter just loves Tom Jones. We ordered a bunch of stuff, including blue ribbons, French toast, chicken, a club sandwich, and a baked potato. Everyone got exactly what they wanted.\n\nI didn't notice any stale smoke smell, and the place didn't feel dirty to me. I actually love the bright orange booths - they're so retro! And the payphone is just the cherry on top. The service is always super fast, and I always get a different waitress. I don't know where they find these awesome young ladies, but they're doing something right! The managers are all on top of things too, which is great to see.\n\nSince Tom Jones is my daughter's fave spot, I'm bumping up my rating from 4 to 5 stars. It's definitely a winner in my book!",
    "As an amateur athlete, I've had the privilege of meeting Dr. Ferrel under circumstances I'd rather forget. During a softball game, I suffered a severe injury that left me sidelined. Dr. Ferrel, who was in attendance, rushed to my aid and expertly relocated my ankle on the field. He then invited me to visit his office for further treatment. However, as a single mother living on a teacher's salary, I was hesitant due to financial constraints. Instead, I sought care from a physician, who delivered a disheartening prognosis: months of recovery before I could return to the game. Feeling defeated and hopeless, I reached out to Dr. Ferrel once more. True to his word, he took me under his care and worked wonders. Not only did he treat my injury, but he also facilitated a remarkable recovery, getting me back on the field in mere weeks. Over the years, I've had the pleasure of returning to Dr. Ferrel for various treatments, each time experiencing astonishing results. To me, he will always be a hero, a testament to the power of exceptional medical care and compassion.",
    "Get ready for an unforgettable experience! Their shows are always a blast, offering a uniquely entertaining and relaxed atmosphere that will leave you feeling carefree and energized. Plus, enjoy delicious food at a fair price, making it the perfect spot for a fantastic night out with friends or family!",
    "Craving satisfaction guaranteed! There are those moments when only In-N-Out will do. You know, when nothing else can hit the spot like a juicy, indulgent burger. I'm talking 4 patties, Animal Style, because why settle for less? It's time to treat yourself to the ultimate In-N-Out experience!",
    "Cindy's establishment is truly exceptional. The culinary experience is enhanced by the outstanding service. The authenticity of the cuisine is matched only by the genuine hospitality of the staff. Notably, all dishes are prepared fresh, and the distinction from other Mexican restaurants is palpable from the first bite. I would highly recommend this establishment to anyone who appreciates authentic Mexican cuisine.",
    "I have been eager to try Trust Me BBQ for over a year, but my initial visit approximately three months ago was disappointing. Despite waiting in line for 10 minutes, I received no service and ultimately left. After reviewing online feedback, I decided to give the establishment another opportunity to showcase its offerings. Unfortunately, my experience was mixed, with the food being average and the service being subpar. As a result, I am unlikely to return.\n\nThe gentleman attending to us at the counter failed to engage with us in any way, neglecting to speak, smile, or acknowledge our presence. The transaction felt impersonal, akin to interacting with a vending machine. Furthermore, when we placed our order, he failed to listen attentively, resulting in incorrect sides being included in our meals. We were forced to correct him while he was serving us.\n\nIn conclusion, I will likely continue to patronize Down to the Bone BBQ instead. The positives of my experience at Trust Me BBQ included the delicious BBQ sauce, the unique and intriguing macaroni salad, and the moist \"pulled\" pork. However, the negatives outweighed the positives. The chicken was excessively dry and inedible, even when paired with the BBQ sauce. The macaroni and cheese appeared to have been sitting on the steam table for several days, and the collard greens lacked robust flavor.",
    "I stumbled upon this hidden gem during my week-long visit to the area and I'm so glad I did! The panang chicken was absolutely delicious. I opted for a one-star spicy level and it arrived promptly. I'll definitely be back for more!",
    "Get ready to fiesta! Cinco de Mayo is all about delicious margaritas, refreshing sangria, and crispy fried treats - and this amazing spot has got it all down pat! They're masters at blending flavors from different cultures to create one-of-a-kind recipes that will tantalize your taste buds. Even though they're not a traditional Mexican joint, they know how to bring the heat with their rock salt and tequila game. And the best part? They just opened a wine bar right next door, perfect for when you need a little extra space or want to try something special. Give it up for their on-the-rocks margaritas and homemade white or red sangria - trust us, it's totally worth the trip!",
    "Discover the Sweet Gem of Hermitage: A Donut Bakery Like No Other!\n\nTucked away in one of Hermitage's oldest shopping centers lies a hidden treasure - a small, family-owned donut bakery that's a must-visit for anyone with a sweet tooth. Owner Yeu's dedication to his craft is evident in the early morning hours he spends perfecting his recipes to bring you the freshest donuts daily.\n\nBut this bakery is no ordinary donut shop. Yeu's creativity shines through in his unique offerings, including donuts topped with crispy bacon, sweet apple fritters, pigs in a blanket, flaky breakfast pastries, and savory kolaches. And then, there's the pièce de résistance - the doughssant, a revolutionary fusion of a donut and a croissant that will leave you wanting more!\n\nThe best part? These indulgent treats won't break the bank. Doughssants are only $1.99 each, while regular donuts are a steal at just $0.60 each. As a parent, I can attest that these sweet treats make the perfect gift for my kids' teachers, who absolutely adore them.\n\nAnd to complete the experience, pair your donut with a freshly brewed cup of coffee.

    "We've had an absolute blast at every event we've attended! From the energy-packed concerts to the thrilling basketball games, each experience has been an unforgettable adventure. And to top it off, the food has been exceptional, featuring a wide range of local favorites that are sure to satisfy any appetite.",
    "Fantastic dining experience! We sampled a variety of dishes, including three appetizers and five entrees, and every single one impressed us. The prices are very affordable, and the service is top-notch. I'd highly recommend this restaurant and would definitely return for more.",
    "The service at this place has gotten worse. We used to come here often, but now we go somewhere else. The service was too slow and they would often forget about us.",
    "I was disappointed with my recent chicken and rice plate from this establishment. When I placed my order, I specifically requested no sauce on the chicken to make it a healthier option. However, when I opened my to-go container, I was surprised to find an excessive amount of oil - approximately 5-7 tablespoons - which was not what I had been told. Unfortunately, this made the dish unappetizing and unhealthy. I was also surprised given the restaurant's slogan, which emphasizes healthy options. I hope they will take my feedback into consideration to improve their dishes and align with their brand promise.",
    "I'm absolutely thrilled with my recent purchase of a washer and dryer from Sears! As a new homeowner, I needed to furnish my entire place with new appliances, and I'm so glad I chose Sears despite some mixed reviews. My experience was completely seamless - the selection was amazing, the sales team was super knowledgeable, and the delivery was lightning-fast. The level of service I received was truly exceptional! The team went above and beyond to find me the best deals and stayed within my budget. They even took the time to scour for additional discounts and sales prices. I appreciated their honest advice and prompt answers to all my questions. I'm thoroughly impressed with Sears and would highly recommend them to anyone!",
    "I'm obsessed with the food here! The service is super speedy, and the staff is genuinely lovely. Every time I walk in to place an order, I feel like I'm among friends - they always make me feel so welcome!",
    "As a skeptic, I walked into the remodeled establishment with low expectations. But, I was pleasantly surprised. The revamped atmosphere was impressive, and the real test - the food - did not disappoint. The mushroom cheese steak, in particular, stole the show.",
    "I'm obsessed with the espresso here - it's seriously top-notch! This is my go-to spot for a perfect Americano. The staff is super friendly and polite, and the atmosphere is always chill and relaxed. Just a heads up, though: there aren't any power outlets, so come charged up! On the bright side, the wifi is unlimited and always reliable. And, I've gotta say, the bathrooms and the whole place are always spotless.",
    "I fell hook, line, and sinker for the rave reviews, but my experience was a crushing disappointment from start to finish. The website, which I thought would give me a sneak peek into their menu, was a letdown. I had to navigate through three locations and scroll to the bottom to find a list of options with zero descriptions or prices. It was like they wanted to keep their menu a secret! \n\nWhen I arrived, I was surprised to find a bar-like atmosphere with tables scattered around. No big deal, but I was excited to try their sandwiches, which were reasonably priced at $6.85. I opted for the roast beef and roast pork combos, hoping for the best. \n\nThe sandwiches arrived quickly, but that's where the excitement ended. The roast beef was ice-cold, while the roast pork was piping hot. I mean, how does that even happen? It was clear that one of them had been sitting around for a while. I asked my waitress to reheat the roast beef, and although it was warmer when it came back, it was still lukewarm compared to the roast pork I had just devoured. \n\nThe real kicker was the lack of meat in both sandwiches. It was like they were trying to make up for it by drowning them in gravy, making them a messy, structural nightmare. The menu did mention a \"wet meat\" option, which I now realize is a must-have. If you're planning to visit, trust me and opt for that style – your taste buds and sandwich will thank you.",
    "Village Whiskey's takeout treasure: a indulgent delight for the senses! The Whiskey Burger, a luxurious treat at $26, is a must-try for those who dare to get a little messy. This juicy behemoth is packed with tender goodness, crispy bacon, and a generous helping of flavor. If you can stomach the steep price tag, get ready for a burger that will leave you weak in the knees. And don't even get me started on the Duck Fat fries - rich, decadent, and utterly irresistible. Treat yourself, but don't say I didn't warn you...",
    "I recently invested $80 in a family meal and found it to be a worthwhile expenditure. The food was served hot and the orange chicken was exceptionally flavorful, surpassing my expectations. As a result, this establishment has earned its place as our go-to destination for Asian cuisine.",
    "I usually do my laundry at my boyfriend's house, but with recent family visitors, I had a mountain of towels, sheets, and comforters to tackle. I needed a reliable laundry mat that was safe, clean, and free of unsavory characters. That's when I stumbled upon this gem of a facility. I was thrilled to find it spotless, well-lit, and staffed by friendly and helpful attendants. The laundry and drying process was incredibly fast - I managed to complete four oversized loads (equivalent to eight regular loads) in under two hours! The amenities were impressive, too: security cameras, flat-screen TVs, magazines, Wi-Fi, clean restrooms, and vending machines. The atmosphere was pleasant and relaxed, with plenty of available washers and dryers. I'm so grateful to have discovered this laundry mat - thank you for providing such a wonderful experience!",
    "We popped in for a spontaneous dinner last evening. The prices were undoubtedly steep. Both pairs of us opted to share a dish, which visibly irked our server, and while the cuisine was satisfying, it didn't quite justify the cost. One notable exception was the incredible garlic bread they served as an appetizer - I could have easily devoured an entire loaf! Overall, I'm unlikely to return to this establishment, but it's possible we caught them on an off night. With so many exceptional dining options in the St. Louis area, the competition is simply too fierce.",
    "I scored a touchdown with my lunch plans today, catching a Seahawks/Saints game at this hotspot and indulging in the mouth-watering Haven burger. No surprise the place was buzzing with energy - the flavors were a real winner! I snagged a seat by the door, but soon found myself navigating a sea of fans to get out - clearly, I wasn't the only one in on the secret. I'll be back for another round, maybe on a quieter Tuesday lunch to avoid the frenzy. The Haven has earned a spot on my playbook!",
    "I've only tried the vermicelli bowls, not the Pho. The portions are decent and reasonably priced. As a bonus, the location is convenient for Alberta Ave residents, and my orders are always ready in 15 minutes, even on busy Friday nights.",
    "I recently dined at this restaurant, and unfortunately, the food was a letdown. I opted for the Chicken Marsala, which our waiter recommended, but it was a disappointment. The chicken was thin, tough, and dry, and the accompanying pasta was undercooked and clumpy. To make matters worse, the dish lacked any discernible flavor.\n\nMy friend's lasagna was also a miss, with a meager layer of pasta and no flavor to speak of. To add insult to injury, when my other friend got up to use the restroom, the staff cleared her plate, despite her telling the waiter she wasn't finished. Although they did bring her a new meal in a to-go bag, it was a frustrating experience.\n\nOn the bright side, the atmosphere was great, and the live music was a nice touch. I did enjoy dancing with my husband. However, considering the subpar food, the high prices were hard to swallow.",
    "This hidden gem boasts an attractive space and a prime location near the Broad Street line, with ample street parking available. As a BYOB establishment, you can bring your favorite drinks to enjoy with their delicious dishes. I've had the pleasure of dining here twice, and every dish has impressed me. Standouts include the flavorful chaats, tender beef short ribs, spicy lamb vindaloo, refreshing beet salad, and savory breads and pickles. The rich chocolate cake is a must-share for the table. Plus, you can grab takeout beer from the corner bar. We can't wait to return and try more!",
    "I highly recommend this restaurant! The ceviche is a must-try, it's absolutely delicious. The atmosphere is lively and enjoyable, and the service is top-notch. Our server, Alex, provided exceptional service - he was friendly, attentive, and thoughtful, making our dining experience truly memorable.",
    "I love this store! The salad bar is always fresh, and they offer a wide variety of ethnic foods to try. Highly recommended!",
    "I recently ordered a delicious Mediterranean chicken shawarma that exceeded my expectations. The generous serving of juicy chicken packed into a flavorful pita was a pleasant surprise. The convenience of having my food ready for pickup upon arrival was a bonus. The excellent service only added to the positive experience, ensuring that I'll definitely be back for more when I'm in the area again.",
    "I'm absolutely obsessed with this hidden gem! The cuisine is mouth-watering, the ambiance is warm and inviting, and the staff are incredibly friendly and attentive. Whether you're a veggie enthusiast or a meat lover, this spot is a must-visit destination that's sure to delight!",
    "After a brief wait, we finally received excellent service. The gumbo was outstanding, and the chicken and waffles were a highlight. The friendly staff and prime location on Bourbon Street made for great people-watching.",
    "I'm so glad I stumbled upon Earl's at the airport! This grab-and-go spot really delivers with its variety of delicious sandwiches - from classic turkey and tuna to a tasty Hawaiian option. But today, the aroma of roast beef won me over, and I'm so glad it did! The generous portion of tender, perfectly cooked beef paired with melted cheddar cheese and a zesty horseradish sauce was absolute perfection. And the best part? No need for lettuce or tomatoes - it's just right the way it is! Plus, its convenient location between the security station and the D gates (just a stone's throw from the Delta SkyClub!) makes it easy to grab and enjoy at the gate or on the plane. Yum!",
    "I'm blown away by this place! The food is top-notch and the service is even better. We kicked things off with an amazing appetizer of cheese curds served with a sweet and spicy red pepper jelly - it was love at first bite! For dinner, I went with the fish tacos and my wife opted for a beer brat. We both thoroughly enjoyed our meals, and the portions were huge and reasonably priced. Our server was fantastic, super attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. They made us feel right at home. The manager even stopped by to check in and I let him know that I've found my new go-to spot to catch a game and grab a beer. He filled us in on their game-day deals and weekend brunch specials. As we left, everyone bid us farewell and reminded us to grab a root beer candy on our way out. I'll definitely be back!",
    "I stumbled upon a hidden gem for dinner and drinks, and I'm still beaming with delight! As a self-proclaimed burger connoisseur, I usually shy away from ordering them at restaurants since I can whip up a mean patty at home. But, oh boy, this place has ruined me for life! The burger was so phenomenal that I'll be hard-pressed to resist ordering it again on my next visit. The cherry on top? A solid beer selection and a warm, welcoming team of wait staff and bartenders who made me feel like a regular. My meal was cooked to perfection, arrived promptly, and the atmosphere was cozy and inviting. And, let's not forget the sparkling clean restrooms - a true testament to their attention to detail! All in all, I left feeling thoroughly impressed and already counting down the days until my return."
