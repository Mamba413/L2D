It seems I have radar helping me spot new friends.\nWell, that's something I've never heard of. But if you ask me what I value most in a friend, I would say honesty.\nI agree. You can't expect a close relationship with a dishonest person. Those are the people that will turn their back on you when you are in need.",

To tell you the truth, I plan to apply for Harvard after graduation from high school. It’s better to get to know it. What about you?\nI get together with my Christian brothers on Saturdays.\nOh, my God! John, I didn’t know you are religious. You just look like a scientific kook, like Leonard in the Big Bang Theory.\nCome on, Han Maimed, don’t make a fuss. A lot of Americans, including many scientists, believe in religion.\nBut I’m really surprised. I thought science and religion are not compatible, are they?\nYes, they are compatible. Actually, the U. S. is both the most developed and the most religious country in the world.\nI've heard about it a little bit before, but I don’t understand. How can people believe in God since they know God doesn't exist?\nThat’s a little complicated. You’ll get to know it when you are acquainted with the U. S. history later on. Religion was and is a part of American people’s life. Guess what? Even Harvard University, which is a highly academic institution, is in a sense the product of religion.\nReally?\nAbsolutely! It was founded by a group of Puritan immigrants from England.\nWhy was it founded by the Puritans? Where were the atheistic educators?\nBecause most of the first English immigrants who came to the United States were Puritans.\nHow come? I mean why most of them were religious people?\nThat’s because in the 16th and 17th century, there was a series of religious reforms in England. Many religious separatists were persecuted and fled to other countries.\nSo, you mean people didn't enjoy religious freedom in England?\nYes, that's why Puritans moved to the New World, where they believed they could establish a heaven for Puritans. Later on, it was these Puritans who founded Harvard College.\nWhy did they want to found a college?\nMany Puritans had received classic style of higher education in Oxford University and Cambridge University back in England. They hoped that their descendants could receive this kind of education as well.\nOh, I see.\nActually Harvard was first named'New College', without a formal name.\nWhen did it begin to be called Harvard University?\nIn 1639, it was renamed after its major benefactor John Harvard. Interestingly, JohnHarvard himself was a clergyman.\nIt seems that Harvard was predestined to be influenced by religion.\nTherefore, it’s not exaggerate to claim that had there not been religion, there would note Harvard.\nWow, I didn’t know that religion had played such an important role in Harvard history.\nReligion has been playing an indispensible part in Harvard history as well as the U. S.\nI finally begin to get to know Harvard. It seems that my knowledge of Harvard is rather poor. I have a lot work to do before applying for Harvard.\nRemember that Harvard is a part of the United States. So you have to know the U. S. history and culture if you want to have in-depth knowledge of Harvard. The two are closely related.\nThat’s right. I have a lot to learn from you.",

That’s some pretty unscientific language there. Sounds more religious to me.\nIt’s all religion. Take the theory of the Big Bang.How is it possible that all of the stuff in the universe comes from an explosion? That’s no better than Atlas carrying the globe on his back or African myths about turtles and stuff.\nTurtles? Whatever...

They must get sick of it.\nI bet they love it really. Sure, they complain about it, but that just gets them more publicity, doesn’t it?\nI think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves.

They need million of dollars to buy big, seclude houses and wonderful dresses. I bet most show biz stars would prefer to wear jeans and a t-shirt, but they can’t because their managers force them to wear clothes they don’t like.\nI don’t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars. They’re overpaid, over-ambitious, and over-adored.\nI think you should give them some credit. They’re very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn. They even donate money to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves.\nCome on! They only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves 。",

    "Frank's tying the knot, can you believe it?\nSeriously?\nYeah, he's head over heels for her.\nWho's his bride?\nI think it's someone he met while vacationing in Spain.",
    "I heard you purchased a new home in the northern suburbs.\nYes, we acquired it on the very day it was listed.\nWhat type of house is it?",
    "How are Zina's new programmers performing?\nI must confess, they're outstanding and incredibly quick. The Filipino programmer is brilliant.\nSo, we'll meet the Stars.com deadline and be operational by next week?\nIt'll be tight, but we’ll make it.\nExcellent. Once Stars.com starts paying us, Vikam's funding will be unnecessary.\nAnd without their funds, we won't need Zina either.",
    "Do you enjoy cooking?\nAbsolutely, I have a real passion for it. I discovered this hobby when I was just 12 years old.\nWhat do you enjoy about it?\nIt's hard to pinpoint, but I love the independence of cooking on my own and the pleasure of tasting delicious dishes.\nThat's fantastic!",
    "Diana, how do you feel about the perfume I got for you?\nIt's nice, but honestly, I hardly ever wear perfume.",
    "Ah, ah, ah...\nAll right, Bill. Here's your daily exercise schedule. First, you are to jog before breakfast.\n\nJog?\n\nThen, walk to work.\n\nWalk?\n\nSpend thirty minutes in the gym at lunchtime.\n\nOh no.\n\nAlways use the stairs, never the elevator.\n\nOh, dear.\n\nAnd three times a week, you can swim, play racquetball, or handball.\n\nOh no.\n\nOK, you can stop now. It's time for dance class.\n\nDance class? I don't know how.\n\nYou will.",
    "Hello Bill, I happened to see your grandmother yesterday.",
    "Dad, why are you putting tape on the windows?",
    "Hi, my name is Lean, and I'm from Russia.\nHi Lean, nice to meet you! I'm Alike, from Japan.\nEnglish is quite challenging for me.\nLearning a second language is always tough.\nThat's true, but English seems especially difficult. It's such a confusing language.\nConfusing? What makes you say that?\nA single letter can be pronounced differently, and a single word can mean different things.\nNo wonder you think English is such a confusing language!",
    "Here’s your hot dog and beer. Did I miss anything while I was away?\nYes, you did! Cal Ripken just hit a home run.\nReally? What’s the score now?\nIt was 3 to 4, but Ripken's home run brought it to 5 to 4 as there was a runner on first base.\nSo Baltimore is in the lead?\nCorrect.\nThis stadium is amazing for watching baseball games.\nAbsolutely, there isn't a bad seat anywhere.",
    "Butterflies were having a wild party in my stomach as I faced my first performance, my nerves reaching a level of intensity I didn't know was possible.",
    "Every nation must confront its past.\nIndeed, we don’t exist in isolation. We have cultural values and extensive, albeit varied, histories.\nAt times, we, as humans, have made mistakes, and it is essential to acknowledge them first.\nHowever, there are always those who wish to deny the reality of history.",
    "Hello, Professor Smith. How are you doing today?",
    "Would you prefer black or white coffee?\nWhite, please.\nLook! There's a folk concert tomorrow evening. Would you like to go?\nI don't really enjoy folk music.\nWhat kind of music do you like?\nI prefer classical music. How about you?",
    "How do you love to spend your free time?",
    "Where is John? I can't find him anywhere.\nHaven't you heard that he is in prison?\nWhat? Excuse me?\nJohn is in prison now. He was caught stealing.\nI just can't believe my ears!",
    "May I assist you?\nI hope so. I'm seeking material for a paper I'm writing and I'm uncertain where to start.\nI will certainly do my best to assist you. What is the subject of your paper?\nThe focus of my paper is on the impact of television on children.",
    "Hey, Ted. Do you have any plans for Friday?\nActually, I have the day off from work.",
    "Do you believe the world improves each year?\nYes, I do. I think science makes us wiser. What about you?",
    "What do you plan to do for your birthday?\nI want to have a picnic with my friends, Mum.\nHow about we have a party at home instead? It would be a great way to get together and celebrate.",
    "Does your family keep records of its ancestry?\nYes, my mom has been diligently working on our family tree for years and is always updating it.\nDo you have a copy of your family tree at home? I’d love to see it.\nI can show it to you now if you’d like. It goes back about eight generations.\nThat's incredible. Do you have a large extended family?\nI have 30 cousins on my mom’s side and 10 on my dad’s side.\nAre you close to your first cousins?\nI’m close to those who are around my age. Now that I’m older, I don’t spend as much time with them, so I don’t know the younger cousins as well as the older ones.\nI see. Who is the head of your household?\nThat would be my mother. In the larger family, her mother is definitely the matriarch.\nInteresting. What does your grandfather think of your step-mother?",
    "Hi, Mr. Wang. Want to go boating with me?\nSounds interesting. When?\nTomorrow afternoon?\nSure. Where?\nAt the park gate.\nGreat. See you then.\nSee you.",
    "I heard you spent the weekend at Saikei Ski Resort. Did you have a good time?\nYes, it was incredibly exciting, although I had the most falls out of everyone on our team.\nDon't they have coaches to help you learn how to ski?\nYes, they do. The coaches are top-level professionals, brought in from the State Sports General Administration.",
    "You're looking rather pale, why?\nI haven't been sleeping well recently.\nYou should get plenty of sleep since you work so hard.",
    "Hey, Maggy, have you heard the news about David?\nAbout David? No, I haven't heard anything.\nYou know, concerning David and his new boss.\nSorry, I don't quite get what you mean.\nWell, I found out that David got fired.\nOh, that's unfortunate. He is really diligent.",
    "How do you normally get to school?\nI typically ride my bike. What mode of transport do you prefer?\nI enjoy cycling because I can see more, but when I'm feeling lazy, I opt to drive my car.\nI believe we should encourage people to reduce their car usage to lower pollution levels.\nI agree, but I find it challenging to give up my car due to its convenience.",
    "Wait, Ben, did I hear you right? You had a party on Saturday?\nYeah, didn't you know? It was my birthday bash!\nNo way, I had no idea!\nBut I sent you an invite. I e-mailed you last week.\nReally? I never saw it. Oh, wait! I forgot to tell you—I got a new e-mail address. I'm so sorry!",
    "What do you plan to do during your year abroad, Tom?\nI’m going to focus on studying extensively. I want to gain a lot of knowledge.\nWill you be taking courses?\nYes, I’ll enroll in some university courses there.\nThat sounds challenging.\nIt will be, but I believe it’s the right decision.\nAren’t you worried about feeling lonely?",
    "Isn't this lovely weather? Would you assist me in watering the flowers, Jack?\nDo you believe I need to?\nI do. We haven't watered them in several days.\nPlease observe the sky. Do you not see the dark clouds? It is going to rain soon.\nGood. That means we do not have to work. How pleasant!\nHowever, I do not find it to be so pleasant.\nWhy?",
    "Oh no, the grocery store is closed!\nYeah, they shut down at ten. But there's that 24-hour store on Sixth Street we could head to.\nGood idea. We're running low on everything.\nI really wish the nearby store was open all day, every day.\nSeriously. With our crazy schedules, sometimes the corner store is the only place still open by the time we get home.",
    "Dad, what's our plan for today?\nWe're heading to the city center first, where we'll grab a drink, and then we'll check out the University Museum.\nWhere are we stopping for the drink?\nThere's a coffee shop just around the corner. Do you see that large building at the end of the street?\nYes, I see it.\nThat's a bank. The coffee shop is right across from it.\nGreat, I'll get a hot chocolate.",
    "How about catching a movie tonight?\nSounds awesome! What's playing?\nI'm not sure of the title, but I know it's a romantic film.",
    "I've decided! I'm getting a tattoo!\nSeriously? Are you absolutely sure about this?\nAbsolutely! Why wouldn't I be? Tattoos are trendy and look amazing! I'm thinking of getting a dragon on my arm or maybe a tiger on my back.\nBut hold on, that's a forever thing! They use permanent ink that can only be removed with laser treatment. Plus, I've heard it can be really painful!",
    "Sure! Here's a more dynamic version of the conversation:\n\n\"Hey, what's that screen near your steering wheel for?\"\n\n\"Oh, it's a portable TV. They're all the rage right now!\"\n\n\"Really? That's a first for me. So, what do you usually watch on it?\"\n\n\"There's a mix—current affairs, documentaries, music, movies, and even some noncommercial ads.\"\n\n\"Anything worth watching?\"\n\n\"Yeah, definitely! There's a lot of good and informative content. I think people often overlook how educational TV can be.\"\n\n\"I totally agree. Are there commercials too?\"\n\n\"Yep, because the TV stations need to earn money from commercials in between shows.\"\n\n\"Makes sense. Does it work well?\"\n\n\"Not always. It depends on the satellite signal transmission.\"\n\n\"Got it. Is there a fee for the programs?\"\n\n\"Yeah, it's 50 Yuan a month.\"",
    "Oh, no!\nHow awful!\nLook out the window.\nOh, dear. That’s really bad. Not what I expected.\nIt’s terrible, isn’t it?",
    "How do you spend your leisure hours, Nancy?\nOh, I find joy in playing the violin.\nReally? How long have you been serenading with the violin strings?\nFor about a decade now. I began my musical journey back in middle school.\nThat's truly fascinating!\nThanks! And what about you? Any favorite pastimes?\nI enjoy collecting matchboxes! Although, I’m not entirely sure if that qualifies as a hobby.",
    "How should I explain this to her?\nDon't stress, you'll figure it out.\nThere's no reason to be so upset.",
    "Which sports do you enjoy participating in?\nI prefer baseball and basketball.",
    "Ace that test tomorrow! We've got our fingers crossed for you!",
    "I'll never work with him again!\nWhat happened? Did you two argue again?\nCan you get my materials back from him, please?\nDon't ask me. I don't want to get involved in your argument.",
    "\"Oh my God! I've been scammed!\"\n\"What? What happened?\"\n\"I bought a brick! I can't believe I fell for it. Damn it!\"\n\"Wait, what do you mean? Why did you buy a brick?\"\n\"There was this guy on the sidewalk with three brand-new Panasonic video camera boxes. He said he needed to get rid of them quickly.\"\n\"And?\"\n\"He offered to sell one to me for twenty dollars—a four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks.\"\n\"And it turned out to be a brick?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"I can't believe you! Why didn’t you open the box?\"\n\"I wanted to, but he insisted that the box was still in its plastic wrap from the store. He said if it was opened, other people wouldn't believe it was new.\"\n\"So the boxes were wrapped in plastic?\"\n\"Yes, the plastic wrap was perfect, just like how new products come. Look, it even had a barcode price sticker on it! It looked legit!\"\n\"But why would anyone be selling brand-new video cameras for twenty dollars?\"",
    "Hey Mary, how's it going?\nJust okay. Last night I met a great guy at the bar, and we had a fantastic time, so we're meeting again tonight.\nOh, that's cool! What does he look like? Is he good-looking?\nAt first, I didn't think so. But once we started talking, I found him really funny and smart. I couldn't stop laughing at his jokes! We have a lot in common, like we support the same team, enjoy the same music, and both love Chinese food! I feel like we’re going to be great friends.\nSounds like you two are a good fit. What do you look for in a friend?\nI don't have a specific list, but usually, when I meet someone, I can tell if they'll be a good friend. It's like I have a radar for spotting new friends.\nI've never heard of that. But for me, honesty is what I value most in a friend.\nI agree. You can't have a close relationship with someone who's dishonest. Those are the people who will abandon you when you need them the most.",
    "Hey, are you okay? You don't look so great.\nYeah, I just have a headache. I've been in physics class all day, and it's tough!\nI enjoyed physics. It's basically all math—arcs, curves, velocity—really interesting stuff.",
    "More and more people today advocate for lifelong learning, but they have different views on what it means. How do you understand lifelong learning? I believe it's the idea that it's never too early or too late to learn. Does this mean studying all the time? I don't think so. It's about your attitude towards learning. One should be open to new ideas, decisions, skills, and behaviors.",
    "How old are you?\nI'm nine, but I'll turn ten on May 1st. When is your birthday?\nI'm older than you! I'll be ten on April 14th.\nAre you going to have a birthday party?\nMaybe. I'll need to ask my mom.",
    "Cheese! Ever noticed how it sometimes tastes like cardboard? I sure do, and maybe that's why it’s so affordable around here.",
    "Hey, have you signed up for the company's Christmas party yet?\n\nAbsolutely, I have! Are you coming?\n\nI definitely am! As a newcomer, I think it’s a great chance to mingle with people from other departments in a fun, relaxed setting.\n\nExactly! Our company’s Christmas party is always a blast. It’s the perfect time for everyone to unwind, connect, and make new friends. Plus, it’s a great opportunity for some light networking.\n\nI hope it’s not going to be too formal with the boss around.\n\nNot at all! It’s totally laid-back. Just the opposite of formal. You’re going to love the game show. Make sure to dress casually. And watch out—there’s always an abundance of drinks flowing!",
    "If the meteorologist’s forecast is correct, it will rain tomorrow. I hope this is not the case, as it would necessitate rescheduling our baseball game.",
    "Hey, Emily! Do you see that tall guy over there?\nYeah, that's Drive! He works with Lily.\nHe's cute. What does he do?\nI think he's a manager, but I'm not sure.\nReally? Can you introduce us?",
    "You didn't call me last night like you said you would.\nI'm sorry for disappointing you.\nIt's all right. But why were you rude to me at lunch?\nWas I? I didn't mean to be. I'm really sorry.\nAnd why are you yawning now? Are you bored?",
    "Hello, Nicole. Was your weekend enjoyable?\nYes, it was. However, I feel exhausted today.\nOh? How come?\nWell, I tidied up the house and played tennis on Saturday. Then, on Sunday, I went hiking in the countryside.",
    "What's the average lifespan where you live?\nI don't know for sure, but it's likely around 75 years. How about in your area?",
    "Mark! It’s been ages!\nJulie! Wow, it’s awesome to see you. How have things been?\nAmazing! I just returned from a week-long getaway to Thailand.\nNo way! How was it?\nAbsolutely incredible! I didn't want to come back.\nI've always heard Thailand’s beaches are like paradise.\nOh, they totally are. The people are super friendly, the food’s to die for, and it’s super affordable.\nI’m a fan of Thai cuisine. Did you explore much of Bangkok?\nNot really. I get my fill of city life in Beijing.\nI get that. A vacation sounds perfect right now.\nHey, wouldn’t it be awesome if we planned a trip to Thailand together someday?",
    "Could I speak with the manager? I have a concern I'd like to address.",
    "Congratulations, Vivian, on winning the grand prize once again.",
    "We’re going to the concert tonight. Wanna come?\nSorry, I can't make it.\nWhy not?\nI’ve been swamped since my boss is out of town.",

    "The music is playing. May I have the honor of dancing with you?",
    "Hey, is anyone sitting here?",
    "Observe this headline, Soo Mi.\nRemarkably, a substantial number of people in the United States undergo divorces.\nIs this trend similar in Korea?\nI do not believe so. In Korea, while some marriages do end in separation, the majority of couples remain together.",
    "Excuse me, where can I register?\nRight over there in the Pacific Pavilion.\nIs that the large, white building?\nYes, that's the one.\nThank you!",
    "How's your educational journey in Australia coming along?\nI’ll be graduating this summer.\nNice! Are you planning to stay in Australia or head back to China for work?\nI'm planning to return to China once I graduate.\nWhy choose to leave a foreign country? Many people hesitate to give up the superior living conditions abroad.\nWell, I believe that personal growth holds more value than just enjoying a superior living environment.",
    "Do you have any favorite hobbies, Tom?\nAbsolutely! I'm really into badminton, table tennis, and, of course, computer games. Lately, gaming has definitely become my top pick.\nI've heard that many teenagers spend countless hours glued to their computers, often neglecting their health. What about you?\nI admit, I'm just as guilty. Some people say it's pointless to sit in front of a screen all day, but I actually find it mentally stimulating.\nYou don't play those violent online games, do you?\nOccasionally.\nThat's not great. I believe spending hours every day on computer games is a waste of time. You might as well engage in something healthy and meaningful.",
    "Absolutely! Here's a more dynamic version:\n\n\"What's the plot of your new movie?\nImagine a high-stakes thriller where I step into the shoes of a relentless detective. It's a gripping tale about a dedicated policeman locked in a cat-and-mouse game as he investigates a series of baffling murders. With almost no evidence to go on, he dives deep into a psychological chase, unraveling clues hidden in the strangest places to catch a shadowy killer.\n\n#Person1#: That sounds intense! Did you enjoy making the film? We've been hearing some buzz about disagreements with other actors and even the director.\"",
    "Mom, my legs are really hurting.",
    "Oh, man. Last night's supper was incredible. My wife prepared an amazing stir-fry!\n\nI absolutely love crispy, bite-sized vegetables coated in a blend of soy sauce and oyster sauce, combined with wilted greens and fresh bean sprouts. Add some onion, garlic, and ginger! Mmm! Mmm! It's almost lunchtime, and I'd do anything for a plate of stir-fry right now!\n\nWell, forget the vegetables—I’m all about the meat. The stir-fry my wife made was hearty and delicious, filled with chunks of beef, bell pepper slices, and onion...\n\nWhat? You call that a stir-fry? More meat than vegetables? That’s the worst thing you could say about a Chinese stir-fry. It’s an affront to the wok she cooked it in! What you had is more like a meat-heavy fajita without the wrap!",
    "Sure, here is the rewritten version:\n\n\"What did you say?\"\n\"I mentioned that it's a lovely day. How about we go for a walk?\"\n\"I'm feeling a bit tired.\"\n\"Come on! A little effort can bring a lot of health benefits.\"\n\"Could you wait a few minutes? I need to finish writing this letter.\"\n\"Don't take too long. It would be a waste to miss out on such beautiful weather.\"",

    "The company canceled your trip to Hong Kong?\nYes, the SARS epidemic isn't under control yet, so it's safer not to go.\nMaybe it's for the best. Without the trip, you can take a break and relax.\nYou're right. We should create a fitness plan and start exercising more. Sitting in the office all day isn't healthy.",
    "Which pair of jeans do you prefer?\nI personally favor the straight-leg jeans.\nHowever, they do not seem to be very fashionable. What are your thoughts on these?\nI am not fond of how they sag; I feel they give an unflattering appearance.\nThat sagging style is actually the trend! You can simply wear boxers with them.\nBut what if someone decides to pull them? What would I do then?",
    "Hey, Charles. What's up?\nOh no!! My car broke down. I'm waiting for a tow truck.\nDo you have a way to get home?\nYeah, my wife is on her way to pick me up.\nThat's good to hear. Do you live around here?\nNo, we live out in the suburbs. How about you?\nI live downtown with my parents.",
    "Congratulations, darling, on our anniversary!\nIndeed, here’s to our first year together and countless more ahead. Cheers!\nI’ll toast to that. Thank you for making this evening unforgettable.\nToday is truly special. They say if you make it through the first year, the rest is much easier.\nGood to hear. Oh, look! The band is playing our song.",
    "What specific activities and celebrations are you planning to organize for your upcoming birthday?",
    "May I have a cigarette?\nOh, thank you. Henry, might I trouble you for a light?\nApologies, here you are.\nThank you. It is a lovely day. It’s unfortunate that I am currently on duty.\nIf you would like, I can remain here with you. I do not have any other engagements.\nOh, no. That would be out of the question.",
    "Hey Rose, what are you working on at the moment?",
    "The mosquitos are relentless!\nSame here, I can’t stop itching. They’re swarming us! Sneaky little pests.\nGot any bug spray?\nNo, I totally forgot to grab some.\nWell, I guess we’ll just have to endure it.\nHey, let’s douse ourselves in beer! If they bite, they’ll get drunk and pass out.\nThat’s hands down the best idea ever! Let’s go for it!\nQuick, they’re back for more!",

    "My daughter intends to leave her current job and seek new employment. She aspires to find a position with better compensation. This seems perfectly reasonable to me, as it is something I also desire.\n\nHowever, what about the idea of settling down and starting a family? Does anyone still value getting married these days?",
    "I have to go.",
    "Pardon me, but is this seat available?\nUnfortunately, it is already taken.",
    "What do you think about the tax increases?\nThe state will probably benefit a lot.\nBut how do most people feel about it?",
    "Are you still coming over to my place for dinner tomorrow night?\nDefinitely! It's still on, right?\nYep, just wondering how you and your roommate are planning to get here.\nWe were thinking of walking both ways since the weather's still nice.\nI figured you might. Just a heads up, though—I live in a bit of a rough area, right near all the bars. It might not be the best idea to walk around after dark.",

    "When I meet people, I have trouble knowing when to shake hands. Can you help?\n\nDo you come from a country where they shake hands?\n\nYes, men, women, and children shake hands all the time.\n\nIt's simple: men shake hands, women and children usually don't.\n\nBut some women and now many well-mannered children also shake hands.\n\nA good rule is to offer your hand to men and wait to see what women and children do.\n\nThat sounds easy enough.",

    "Do you converse exclusively in English during the class, or does your instructor provide explanations in Spanish?\nOh, we never converse in Spanish in class! Miss Parker communicates with us solely in English.\nI guess that's the right approach. Does she speak English at a slow pace?\nNot necessarily. Occasionally, we don't grasp what she's saying. She then has to reiterate her words.\nIt must be fascinating to learn English.\nMario and I are the top students in the class. Miss Parker mentions that my pronunciation is excellent.",
    "Han Maimed, what's your plan for the weekend?\n\nI'm planning to explore Harvard University and learn more about it. To be honest, I intend to apply to Harvard after I graduate from high school, so I think it's a good idea to get familiar with it. What about you?\n\nI usually spend Saturdays with my Christian fellowship group.\n\nOh, wow! John, I didn't know you were religious. You always struck me as a science buff, like Leonard from The Big Bang Theory.\n\nCome on, Han Maimed, don't make a fuss. Many Americans, including many scientists, are religious.\n\nI'm genuinely surprised. I thought science and religion didn't mix.\n\nActually, they can be compatible. The U.S. is both one of the most developed and religious countries in the world.\n\nI've heard that a little before, but I don't quite understand. How can people believe in God when they know God doesn't exist?\n\nIt's a bit complex. You'll understand it better when you learn more about U.S. history. Religion has always been a significant part of American life. Even Harvard University, a highly academic institution, has roots in religion.\n\nReally?\n\nAbsolutely! It was founded by Puritan immigrants from England.\n\nWhy was it founded by Puritans? Where were the atheistic educators?\n\nMost of the early English settlers in what is now the United States were Puritans.\n\nWhy were so many of them religious?\n\nDuring the 16th and 17th centuries, England underwent several religious reforms, leading to the persecution of many religious separatists. They fled to other countries seeking religious freedom.\n\nSo, people didn't have religious freedom in England?\n\nCorrect. That's why Puritans moved to the New World, where they believed they could create a haven for their beliefs. It was these Puritans who established Harvard College.\n\nWhy did they want to found a college?\n\nMany Puritans had received a classical education at Oxford and Cambridge in England. They wanted their descendants to have access to the same kind of education.\n\nOh, I see.\n\nHarvard was originally called 'New College.'\n\nWhen did it become Harvard University?\n\nIn 1639, it was renamed in honor of its major benefactor, John Harvard, who was a clergyman himself.\n\nSo, Harvard has always been influenced by religion.\n\nIndeed. It's not an exaggeration to say that without religion, Harvard might not exist.\n\nWow, I didn't know religion played such a pivotal role in Harvard's history.\n\nReligion has been integral to both Harvard's history and that of the U.S.\n\nIt looks like I have a lot to learn about Harvard. My knowledge seems quite limited.\n\nRemember, Harvard is a part of the United States. To understand Harvard deeply, you need to know U.S. history and culture. The two are closely connected.\n\nYou're right. I have a lot to learn from you.",
    "I remain unconvinced by the explanation you have provided. Would you mind offering a more detailed clarification?",
    "What activities do you enjoy during the summer season?\nI love venturing out into the countryside for walks or bike rides. The fresh summer air is invigorating. How about you?\nI don't often go for walks, but I like to engage in outdoor sports such as tennis or badminton, or simply relax in the sunshine with a good book.\n\nWhat about winter activities?\nIn winter, I frequently participate in indoor sports. If I'm in a lazy mood, I prefer watching films at home. Overall, I favor summer over winter.\nMany people share that preference. I enjoy wearing nice, colorful clothes in summer, like dresses or skirts, which are too cold for winter weather.\nAbsolutely. I also appreciate wearing shorts in summer, but they wouldn't be practical in the winter cold.\n\nDo you anticipate a pleasant summer this year?\nWith global warming, we might experience hotter temperatures than ever before!",
    "Linda will always hold a special place in my heart, as she was my first love. While you believe that time will help me move on, I recall hearing that forgetting someone you're determined to remember can be challenging. Despite this, I trust that with time, everything will eventually change.",
    "I've been selected to organize the next family reunion.\nThat sounds like fun! Do you have complete freedom over the planning?\nYes, I do. I should start making plans now.\nDo most family members generally attend these reunions?\nAlmost everyone comes. Our immediate family alone has a few hundred members.\nHow many days will the reunion last?",
    "Hi, my name is Lean, and I'm from Russia.\nNice to meet you, Lvan. My name is Alike. I'm from Japan.\nEnglish is hard for me.\nA second language is always hard.\nTrue, but English is harder than most. It's a weird language.\nA weird language? Why do you say that?",
    "How was the film in your opinion?\nI enjoyed it. I thought it was fantastic.\nI enjoyed it as well. How did you find the acting?\nI thought it was superb. What about you?\nI wasn't impressed, I actually found it disappointing.\nThe cinema itself is nice, don’t you think?",
    "What's up? You don’t look so good.\nYeah, I just have a headache. I’ve been in physics class all day. It’s tough!\nI liked physics. It’s mostly math—arcs, curves, velocity, cool stuff.\nYeah, but today’s lesson was about the creation of the universe.\nA physics class on the creation of the universe? That sounds more like religion than science.\nIt’s all like religion. Think about the Big Bang theory. How can everything in the universe come from an explosion? That's as hard to believe as myths about Atlas or turtles in African stories.\nTurtles? Whatever... Look, creating matter just needs an imbalance of particles and anti-particles. At least, that's what the math says.",
    "Which film shall we see? There is nothing good at the moment. Let's do something different. Would you like to go to a concert?",
    "Everyone aims for financial success. To retire wealthy, it's essential to invest your savings. I'm considering purchasing stocks. It might be a sound investment if I can handle it properly. What's your opinion?\n\nI somewhat agree with you. While buying stocks isn't hard, earning consistent profits from them is quite challenging. Even experts struggle with it, so proceed with caution. For individuals like us, guidance in investing is crucial. Why not conduct some online research? There are numerous data, reports, and discussion forums to learn about investing. Additionally, you should check reputable websites that provide stock charts.",
    "May I use your suit?\nAbsolutely not.",
    "Bill, what's got you in such a great mood today?\nOh, guess what? I finally moved out of my place with that roommate.\nNo way! What happened?\nHave you ever heard of Brian Locker?\nBrian Locker? Doesn't ring a bell. How would I know him?",
    "Where are you from?\nI'm from Guangzhou.\nWhere is Guangzhou in China?\nIt's in the south of China.",
    "I need to leave now because I have an appointment at 6:00 PM.\nI understand. I won't hold you up any longer. Feel free to visit anytime.\nAlright, goodbye.\nUntil next time.",
    "Greetings! How was your first day of class? I am in level two and am thoroughly enjoying my class this semester. It is wonderful to be in a class comprised of international students.\n\nMy day was satisfactory, although no one in my class speaks English. I anticipate this will compel me to converse more in Chinese during class, which should lead to substantial improvement this semester.\n\nThis situation is both fortunate and unfortunate. My class resembles the United Nations! We have students from various parts of the world including three Germans, a Pole, a Scot, two French, an American, and a Brazilian. \n\nThere is certainly a remarkable diversity of nationalities in your class. Meanwhile, everyone in my class, with the exception of myself, is from Asia. We have a few South Koreans, several Japanese, as well as students from Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, the Philippines, and Kazakhstan.",
    "I'm hungry. Are you?",
    "Good morning, Miss Li.\nMorning, Mike.\nI apologize for missing yesterday.\nI’ve already received your sick-leave note. How are you today?\nI'm feeling a lot better now.\nDid you get the reading material distributed yesterday?\nYes, I have it. Thanks.",
    "Do you like flowers?\nYes, I love them.\nWhat's your favorite flower?\nForsythia, also known as winter jasmine, symbolizes the arrival of spring.\nSpring is so lively.\nAbsolutely. What about you?\nI adore plum blossoms; they bloom beautifully even in the cold winter.\nYou have exquisite taste!",
    "What type of music do you enjoy?\nI enjoy energetic and upbeat tunes, like dance music. I actually hit the disco nearly every week. Occasionally, it can get a bit too loud. You lean towards classical music, right?\nIndeed, I do. I find it incredibly soothing. I often unwind with pieces by Mozart or Bach after a stressful workday.",
    "Guess what? A brand-new coffee shop is about to open just down the street! I'm crossing my fingers that they offer an exciting and diverse menu because, let's be honest, most places only serve coffee and Danish. Speaking of which, you're not a coffee drinker, are you? No wonder you find it dull when you join us for our afternoon hangouts at the usual coffee spots. Here's hoping this new place spices things up for everyone!",
    "Darling, guess what! Bobby and Evelyn are expecting a baby soon!\n\nReally? But I thought she couldn't conceive.\n\nSurprise! The baby is due right on my birthday.\n\nWhat an incredible coincidence! Bobby must be over the moon. He's always wanted kids.\n\nAbsolutely, they're both thrilled. Evelyn keeps daydreaming about what the baby will look like, being half American and half Chinese.\n\nOh, that explains why they wanted to visit us. The anticipation is so exciting! Do they know if it's a boy or a girl?\n\nIt's still a mystery. Evelyn is only three months along, but she's already started her maternity leave.",
    "That concert was absolutely amazing!\nI couldn't agree more.\nThe band used to be a huge sensation.\nIt's incredible how well they performed!",
    "I have tickets to see The Phantom of the Opera this Friday night. Would you like to join me?\nThanks, I'd love to! What time does the show start?\nIt starts at 8:00.",
    "No, it's the Japanese team leading. Japanese teams often emerge as strong contenders unexpectedly.",
    "Harry is feeling so low that he refuses to speak to anyone. I completely understand how that feels.",
    "Hello, is this David?\nHi, Jenny. Yes, it's David.\nHey, what's going on?\nNot a lot. My girlfriend just broke up with me.",
    "That's a sweet ride! What did the dealer charge you for it?\nA hefty sum. I'll probably be working extra jobs for life, but it's worth it. Hop in. Let's take it for a spin.\nAlright, let's speed up! Wow! This thing really picks up speed quickly.\nWatch this when I hit the brakes suddenly. It can come to a stop in no time.",
    "Robert is advancing in age. I am quite concerned about his health.",
    "Which church do you go to?\nI’m Mormon, so I attend the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\nHow is it different from other churches?\nMormons believe that after Jesus and his Apostles died, the original church became corrupt and lost its authority. In 1830, God called a prophet named Joseph Smith to restore the church.",
    "Apologies for my tardiness to the meeting today; I encountered heavy traffic on the way.",
    "Hey there! What are you reading in the newspaper?\nHey! I was tired from studying, so I decided to relax with the newspaper. But the news is so depressing. There’s been another murder downtown. I can’t believe the police haven’t caught the killer yet.\nPeople are getting really scared. Everyone will breathe a sigh of relief when they finally catch the murderer.\nYou mean “if” they catch the murderer. I’m terrified of going downtown at night.\nThere has to be some good news in the paper. I can’t believe nothing made you happy or excited.\nActually, there was one good piece of news. Do you remember the local girl who was dying from a rare blood disease?\nYeah, her parents were raising money for her treatment in the United States.\nWell, they’ve raised the money, and she’s going for treatment tomorrow.\nThat’s fantastic! I’m so happy for the family. They must be so relieved and excited!",
    "Hey Tom! Are you up for a game of bowling tonight?\nAbsolutely, that sounds awesome! When and where should we meet?\nHow about we meet at the club entrance at 6:30 PM?\nPerfect, see you then!",
    "Are there many idioms in English?\nYes, there are hundreds. English is particularly rich in idiomatic expressions. \nCan you give us an example?\nSure, take \"look up\" for instance. It doesn’t mean to gaze at the sky or the ceiling. Instead, it means to search for and find information.",
    "Why did the teacher reprimand Myra in front of everyone?\nBecause Myra was caught cheating on exams and responded disrespectfully.",
    "Do you know where I can park?\nDo you need a place here or off campus?\nI want a space on campus.\nThere is a parking garage for students.\nWhere is it located?\nHead to the western part of the campus, and you will see it there.\nIs it crowded?",
    "Have you heard of the \"Love Bug\"?\nDo you mean the \"I love you\" email virus?\nYes, it's one of the most harmful computer viruses and is rumored to resurface this Valentine's Day.\nThat's terrible. Why do hackers do such things?",
    "Would you like to meet for lunch this Saturday?\nSorry, I'm not available. I'm busy.\nWhat's keeping you busy?\nI volunteer on the first Saturday of each month.\nWhat kind of volunteering do you do?\nI assist at the children's hospital by planning activities.",
    "Look, there are actual words tattooed on the fish!\nI believe they're supposed to be lucky symbols. This seems to be a trendy thing now.\nMy goodness, it's so brutal. How can people be so heartless?\nNot at all. I find these tattoos incredibly stylish and sophisticated.\nYou can't just harm a fish to satisfy the twisted desires of some people.\nSweetheart, you're overreacting. It's just an animal.\nJust an animal? It's a living being too. If you want a tattoo, go ahead and get one. That's your choice because you want it. But did anyone ever consider if the fish wanted one?",
    "It was a pleasure meeting you. \nI look forward to us crossing paths again. \nDefinitely, I'll reach out with a call.\nSounds great.",
    "Did you check out last year’s sales data? It was discussed during our recent board meeting, and there's fantastic news for our shareholders.\nYes, I reviewed the numbers this morning. We’re profitable again!\nWe’ve achieved unprecedented sales, with outstanding growth this year. Our market share has increased to 8%, a 120% rise from the previous year. Our strategy is paying off!\nNot only did our annual sales reach a new high, but our monthly earnings also surpassed our projections. After a challenging two years, we're finally back in the positive.\nThe company's performance has improved significantly since Wallace took over as president. He’s transformed our small business into a highly profitable venture. Our products are flying off the shelves.",
    "What a letdown. I was eager to experience Mafia culture firsthand.\nStill, it's worth the trip just to taste the Mafia's cuisine! The five-dollar tiramisu is a culinary delight.\nDoes such a thing exist?\nFortunately, yes. You're blushing!\nAm I? Well, my face does get red when I walk too fast.",
    "Did you earn any awards or honors during college?\nAbsolutely! I was proud to receive a scholarship three years in a row.",
    "The long weekend is here with Monday off for Memorial Day. It's the start of barbecue season, and we're invited to a grill party in the park tomorrow.",
    "Hi, Martin. I've been searching for you all morning. Where have you been? \n\nI needed to tell you something important: I'm leaving for America tomorrow.\n\nAmerica? Did you get into MIT?\n\nYes, I did.",
    "Taylor's been in the hospital for a couple of days, and it’s my fault; my football moves put him there. But it's not your fault he's still there. Why are they running all those tests anyway? I'm not sure, but we can find out. I brought some crosswords to keep him busy.",
    "Did you catch Ally Mabel's performance last night?\nYes, I did. Did you?\nI did, and it was hilarious!\nAbsolutely, I enjoyed it thoroughly. The scene with the judge was fantastic, wasn't it?",
    "Attention! The tea water is about to boil over. Could you kindly extinguish the burner? My hands are currently covered in dough. \nOf course.",
    "Did you run into May today?\nYeah, I did. What's up with her looking so down?\nBeats me.\nI figured she'd be in a good mood.\nRight? Especially after her recent promotion.\nWho knows, maybe it’s something personal.",
    "I don't think the teacher had the right to say that. Accusing her in front of the whole class was wrong.\n\nYou must be joking! The teacher has the right to say anything, and if she saw Myra cheating, she certainly had the right to address it.\n\nI agree she had the right to address it, but I feel it should have been done privately.\n\nYou're right. If I were the teacher, I wouldn't have done that.",
    "Come on in! I'm thrilled you're here – we’ve been eagerly waiting for you. Am I late to the party? Looks like everyone’s already having a blast. Hope I didn't miss any of the fun!",
    "Steven, are you interested in joining us for dancing tonight?\nJohn, I'm just not feeling up to it.\nYou seem really down. What's bothering you?\nI lost the table tennis match yesterday.",
    "The band is quite good. What do you think of the music?\nIt's lovely. It's been a while since I've listened to live music. This is enjoyable.\nIn that case, can I invite you to the next dance?\nSure. But I must admit, I'm not a great dancer...\nDon't worry about it. I'm not much of a dancer either.\nYou're doing a great job dancing.\nYou dance beautifully, too.\nWhen did you learn to dance?",
    "In my opinion, the major environmental issue in my country is air pollution. I must say, I concur. The air quality here is significantly worse than back home, which is more agriculture-focused and less industrialized. Although we've made progress in cutting down air pollutants lately, vehicles remain a significant contributor. On the bright side, factories have improved due to stricter environmental regulations.",
    "I’m so thrilled, mom. A new baby!\nMy very first grandchild.\nAnd my first nephew. He resembles you a lot, mom. He really does.\nDo you think so? Well, I suppose he does look a lot like me. Oh, but he has Richard’s eyes.\nYes, he does have Richard’s eyes. The baby resembles you more than Richard does.\nWell, children typically resemble their parents.\nThat’s true. Michelle is very similar to Henry in many ways. And she is shy around new people just like he is.\nYou often enjoy comparing children to their parents.",
    "Have you ever been to Disney World?\nWhen I was young, my parents took me to the one in California. I always forget — is that one Disneyland or Disney World?\nThe one in Florida is Disney World, and the one in California is Disneyland, so you must have been to Disneyland.\nThat's right. Why do you ask?\nWell, I've never been to either, and I was thinking of going to Disney World for my honeymoon.\nWhen are you getting married?\nSometime next year. We haven't set the date yet.\nCongratulations! I had no idea.\nThank you. So what do you think? Would we have a good time?\nDo you like amusement parks?\nMostly, yes. Some of the rides are a bit too scary for me, though.",
    "Do you speak French?\nYeah, but not very well.\nCan you understand your Spanish teacher?\nKind of. How well do you understand Mr. Wang, your Chinese teacher?\nMaybe 40 percent, if he speaks slowly. When he talks fast, I only catch a few words. But Mr. Wang is an excellent Chinese teacher. Thanks to him, my Chinese is improving a lot.",
    "You look better today. How did your test go?\nMuch better than yesterday.\nDid you pass?\nI not only passed but aced it! I'm so happy!\nYou should be. You worked really hard preparing for it.\nThanks for helping me. Without your encouragement, I wouldn't have passed.\nYou don't have to thank me. It's my job as your counselor.\nDid you always do well at school?",
    "May I borrow your CDs for our school dance?\nWow, that's quite a request!\nI promise to take personal care of each one and return them in perfect condition.\nHow about this: your class can rent them from me for the night, and you can pay for any that get damaged.\nThat sounds reasonable. It's still cheaper than hiring a live band.\nBut a live band would be so much more exciting!\nUnfortunately, our class doesn't have enough budget for that. We've already looked into it.",
    "Would you like to go to the beach tonight?\nSure, which one?\nI was thinking about Malibu Beach.\nI prefer Santa Monica.\nThe water there seems pretty dirty.\nI enjoy the pier at Santa Monica.\nI agree, especially because the pier is stunning at night.\nIs Malibu Beach nice?\nIt's much nicer, and I really prefer it.",
    "The world faces a lot of environmental problems today. Do you think we can solve them, or will they end up causing major damage?",
    "Hey Kathy! How's it going? It's been forever! What are you up to these days?\n\nI just opened my own restaurant and I'm the head chef.\n\nNo way! You used to hate cooking!\n\nYeah, I did, but now I actually love it.\n\nWhen did that happen?\n\nAfter I tried French food. Before that, I was always making boring stuff for my family.\n\nThat's wild! Did you go to cooking school?\n\nYep, I went to California to study.\n\nSeriously? How long were you there?\n\nFrom '88 to '90.\n\nWhat did you do after that?",
    "Hey Susan,\n\nYou're invited! I hope you and Frank can make it to our housewarming party this weekend.\n\nWait, a housewarming party?\nYes, Deborah and I just bought a new home in Woodlawn!\n\nCongrats! That's amazing news. You both must be so excited!",
    "How can I help you?\nI'm looking for a book.\nWhat's the issue?\nIt looks like this library doesn't have it.\nHave you checked the computer?\nYes, I have.",
    "Welcome to ABC Rent-a-Car! How can I assist you today?\nI'm looking to rent a car. What options do you have?\nWe've got an exciting lineup for you: Volkswagen, Pinto, Plymouth, and Datsun!",
    "Would you be available to join me at the party this evening?\nCertainly, I would be delighted.",
    "Which film should we watch? Actually, there’s nothing good playing right now. How about we do something different? Want to go to a concert instead? \n\nSure, I’d love to. There’s a good one featuring Mozart and Beethoven at the Festival Hall.",
    "Spring Festival is the biggest celebration in China, isn't it?\nYes, absolutely!",
    "I'm so fed up with waiting for the bus!\nTotally, especially when you've got something urgent to handle.\nBut taxis are just too expensive.\nAbsolutely!",
    "I don't have enough solid proof to move forward with prosecuting him. Why don’t you track down someone who's truly in the loop? That's what I've been pondering, but the problem is, I have no idea who is actually well-informed.",
    "What's going on in here? We heard you weren't feeling well and came to check on you.",
    "You don't seem happy. What's wrong?\nOh, it's nothing major. I'm just feeling a bit exhausted.\nFrom work?\nFrom everything… everyone… all of this!\nHere's a good suggestion: you need a holiday.",
    "Dad, what’s today's date?\nIt’s December 18th.\nOnly seven days until Christmas!",
    "What's wrong, John? \nNothing.\nThen why do you seem so upset?",
    "Is this man your fiancé, Dolly?\nYes, what do you think of him?\nHe's handsome. \nWhat’s his personality like?\nHe's outgoing and honest, but sometimes a bit conservative.",
    "Brooke, are you still upset? Is your mother still upset?\nNo, my mother confirmed that the wedding will be held at home on the 2nd. Let us trust that this date is indeed auspicious, as your mother believes.\nIt will be. Today is also fortuitous. I have spoken with the airlines...\nAre they reinstating our seats?\nNo, they are providing us with discounted tickets for a honeymoon package in...\nHawaii? My ideal honeymoon destination?\nPrecisely. We will depart directly from Texas.\nOh, Jack! That's excellent news!",
    "As the world evolves, family structures shift too. Nowadays, people prefer smaller families with two parents and one child, known as a nuclear family.",
    "What happened?",
    "John dates her seven times a week. Maybe he's fallen for her.",
    "I heard that my friend Joe has been speaking negatively about me, which is quite disappointing. However, I find it hard to believe that Joe would do such a thing. It's important not to jump to conclusions too quickly. I think it would be best to speak with him directly to clarify the situation.",
    "Hey, Loans, how’s it going this morning?\nHey, Mr. Smith, doing well.\nI’ve got to hand it to you; you’ve been really dedicated.\nThanks a lot, Mr. Smith. Just doing what I’m supposed to.\nAbsolutely. We're really proud of your effort, Loans.\nI appreciate you saying that.",
    "I've visited most of Europe, several Asian countries including China, Japan, Korea, and Thailand, as well as the United States and Canada. \n\nHaven't you been to Australia?\nNo, but I'm planning to visit Australia and New Zealand soon. I've heard they're beautiful. \n\nWhich is the most beautiful country you've been to?\nNorway. It has picturesque fjords, waterfalls, and mountains.\n\nIsn't it really cold there?\nThe north is almost always cold, but the south can be fairly warm in summer. It's a wet country, with snow almost everywhere in winter.",
    "Welcome to my birthday celebration. I am delighted that you could attend.\nThank you for the invitation. Here is a gift for you. Happy Birthday, Francis! Wishing you many more happy and healthy years.\nThank you! Shall I open it now?\nYes, please do.",
    "Did you see the news about China’s property prices rising the fastest in 18 months in December, raising fears of a property market bubble?\nNo. Does the newspaper explain why that happened?\nYes, it mentions that the increase was due to a rush of purchases in the fourth quarter, expecting tighter regulations.\nI believe the government should take steps to cool down the market.\nAgreed. The increasing property prices are causing problems for Chinese residents.",
    "I believe that celebrities have an enviable lifestyle. They are wealthy, enabling them to purchase nearly anything their hearts desire. Their fame ensures that they are adored by many.\n\nOn the other hand, I imagine their lives can be quite challenging. With paparazzi constantly snapping photos, invading their every move, they must grow tired of it.\n\nBut perhaps they secretly enjoy the attention. Complaining about it only seems to garner more media coverage, doesn’t it?\n\nI think most celebrities aren't seeking personal publicity; they aim to promote their projects, like films.\n\nNo way! They crave personal limelight as it leads to more film offers, invites to elite parties, and even recording opportunities. Their lives appear effortless, filled with perks like free drinks at events.\n\nHowever, celebrities also have substantial expenses. Their need for millions to afford lavish homes and glamorous wardrobes is significant. Despite this, I bet many would rather wear casual attire, but fashion choices are often dictated by their managers.\n\nIt's hard for me to sympathize with celebrities. They are excessively compensated, overly ambitious, and excessively worshipped.\n\nThey deserve some respect. Their talent justifies their earnings, and they often donate to charities, helping those in need.\n\nReally? They only do charity work to attract more media attention, boosting their fame and promoting their projects further.",
    "Hi, what a nice surprise!\nIt's been so long! How have you been?",
    "Hey, Mary, stop tapping your pen. It's driving me crazy.\nFine! Then stop slurping your coffee and shouting on the phone!",
    "The weather in Beijing is absolutely stunning! Autumn truly shines here, don't you think? Absolutely, I can see why you'd say that. The oppressive heat of summer has dissipated, and the harsh chill of winter is still a distant thought. How's the weather in Washington around this season? Autumn is equally delightful in Washington. Does it get very chilly in the winter there?",
    "\"Mike, you have to see this painting of shrimp! It’s so simple, yet bursting with life!\"\n\"Wow, it’s incredible! Is this by Qi Baishi?\"\n\"Yes, it is! How did you guess?\"\n\"Well, Qi is renowned worldwide, and I have a keen interest in Chinese paintings.\"\n\"That's awesome! Do you prefer free sketch or the detailed, claborate-style?\"\n\"I lean towards free sketch, especially the landscape paintings. They always bring me a sense of peace and harmony.\"\n\"Absolutely. Chinese art emphasizes the balance between humanity and nature, a cornerstone of traditional Chinese culture.\"",
    "The weather is awful, isn't it? It stopped snowing, but it's even colder. Look at the ice hanging from the eaves and the snow-covered streets. Do you know today's temperature? I missed the weather forecast. It feels like it's at least ten degrees below zero. I don't mind the cold, but I hate when it gets slippery. The ice will soon be thick enough for skating. I love winter sports.",
    "\"Nick, it’s so sweet of you to see me off!\"\n\n\"Of course! Did you have a blast on your vacation?\"\n\n\"Absolutely! I'll miss you so much when I leave.\"\n\n\"Same here. Promise me you’ll write as soon as you get to Boston.\"\n\n\"Count on it! And don’t worry, I remember your phone number. Expect a call soon.\"\n\n\"Perfect. Looks like they’re starting to board.\"",
    "What are your working hours?\nEight to twelve in the morning, two to six in the afternoon. Much better than mine.\nWhat are yours?\nMine vary—sometimes day shift, sometimes night shift.",
    "Can you share which university you attended, Mr. Smith?\nI attended Yale University.\nReally? What was your major?\nI earned a B.A. in Economics.\nWould you mind sharing your age?\nI am twenty-seven years old.\nCould you also tell me about your previous jobs?\nCertainly, I have been working in a bank for the past few years.",
    "Wow, what a beautiful garden! Look at these tulips!\n\nThis would make a great photo. Could you take my picture here, hon? Try to get the garden in the background too.\n\nSure thing. Could you stand a bit closer to the flower bed? Perfect. Smile! Say \"cheese.\" Got it. That looks fantastic.\n\nThanks! Could you take one more from this angle?\n\nOf course.\n\nNow let's take one together!"
