    "The world has been shattered by Russia’s attack on Ukraine in the past few days. Ukraine’s forces have put up remarkable resistance to this attack, but the war is entering an even bloodier phase. Europe could be witnessing the first major military invasion in years. Many people have been displaced, and many Ukrainian citizens have fled neighboring countries for peace. Gunshots and artillery fires have been raining down on residential areas in Ukraine, with several media houses and newspapers reporting the events and sharing the news with the rest of the world. Various newspapers have reported the news differently, with the difference seen in headlines, videos and images posted. The two newspapers covering the events in Ukraine are the New York Times and Le Monde, a French newspaper. While New York Times and Le Monde report the same event, the two use very different terms to describe similar activities. In the recent takeover of the city of Kharkiv by the Russian forces, for example, the NYT headline read “Russian Troops Take Over Kharkiv,” Le Monde , on the other hand, read “La Russie A Envahi Kharkiv” to mean “Russia Has Invaded Kharkiv.” Recently a video of Ukrainian citizens making Molotov cocktail Petrol bombs was shared. The headline in NYT read, “Ukraine Prepare Molotov Cocktail In Kyiv.” Le Monde ‘s headline read “Ukrainian Resistance Using Molotov Bombs.” Because headlines are the deciding factor for people to read an article, newspapers make them enticing. The New York Times uses headlines that suggest this is another world war, while Le Monde downplays the illegality of what Russia is doing. The differences seen in the headlines of the two newspapers are all for the attraction of their audiences; each magazine writes eye-catching unique topics.",
    "Charles Schwab is a for-profit Corporation whose main business is savings and loans. The company provides banking and asset management services, and financial advisory. It has several subsidiaries – Charles Schwab & Co., Inc., Charles Schwab Investment Management, Inc., TD Ameritrade, Inc., and TD Ameritrade Clearing, Inc., which are all limited liability companies (“The Charles Schwab Corporation,” 2021). This paper aims to analyze the form of business in Charles Schwab Corporation (CSC). Charles Schwab is a corporation, which is a form of business with some distinctive features. Firstly, its officers are agents, unlike its directors and shareholders, which means that the latter are not involved in the company’s current strategic, managerial and other business decisions (“Corporation,” 2022). Secondly, the corporation is managed by the board of directors who have the right to appoint the officers. This approach creates a balance of managerial forces, since CEOs and CFOs are directly involved in the work processes, and the board of directors, in extreme cases, has the right to dismiss them by voting. In the corporation, shareholders are free to transfer ownership, which means that in critical situations such as bankruptcy, the corporation can be sold to another owner. This outcome is possible because the corporation is an organization that creates an opportunity for investors to profit by investing, unlike an LLC (“Forming a corporation,” 2022). Finally, in corporations, the income is taxed twice: the first time at the corporate level, and a second time if dividends are distributed to shareholders. Thus, the form of business in Charles Schwab Corporation was analyzed. The CSC is a corporation with several subsidiaries and conducts business following the requirements for a corporation form of organization. A distinctive feature of corporations is the board of directors, which has an indirect influence on daily decision-making. Still, in critical cases, it can appoint new officers to manage the company. Corporations can also transfer property rights in the event of bankruptcy or other cases.",
    "The work of a clinical or medical office worker is characterized by a combination of a large number of administrative operations with medical activities. Primarily, these professionals are office assistants filling out paperwork and interacting with staff (“How to become a medical office assistant,” 2021). As a result, I will be approaching interviews for this job in a professional business style. While the fitting suit can be expensive, I already have the proper formal attire. Using my black formal suit, shoes, and minimal accessories, I can make the right impression without reducing my budget. In warm weather, I can go to an interview right in a suit, and in cold weather, I can add my usual outerwear, for example, an overcoat. Work clothes, theoretically, may require additional investments and purchases. All healthcare workers, including office workers, must wear a special uniform called scrubs, consisting of a short-sleeved shirt and trousers. This uniform is relatively cheap, and a single set of scrubs can be found on Amazon for about $20-$40 (“Medical assistant’s uniform,” 2019). Most of all, in this context, one needs to take care of shoes since these specialists sometimes have to stand or walk a lot. A good pair of closed-toe shoes can cost around $100, but I have tennis shoes that fit the dress code (“Medical assistant’s uniform,” 2019). However, it must be taken into account that many medical institutions issue uniforms on their own, considering them as consumables, so the choice of purchasing a uniform will depend on the rules of a particular hospital. In any case, it is simple and easy to wear, so it will not entail high costs. Reflecting on the points studied and prepared, I want to note that the new information will affect my budget and life plan very little. In the best case, if the hospital issues uniforms, I won’t have to spend any money at all, as I can wear my existing suit for the interview and shoes for work. In the worst case, I will still be within the budget when I have to buy everything for work. Therefore, I can put that $200 aside and mentally prepare for possible demands from my interviewers. In addition, this study showed that the issue of clothing for interviews and work is not a problem for me, and I am already prepared for it in many respects.",
    "Carl Jung identifies the mother complex with an innate feeling of care at the center of the emotional attachment between a mother and a child. However, in the absence of such an attachment, an archetype develops where someone’s mother fails to satisfy the essential demands associated with the relationship. The outcome leads the victim, the child, to seek comfort elsewhere (Bobroff 35). At the core of the mother complex is the mother archetype, meaning that in every emotional attachment, between the child and the mother, on the one hand, an archetype nourishing and security image manifests. On the other hand, an archetype that devours possessiveness, deprivation, and darkness comes out (Bobroff 36). In the film Every Secret Thing , a complex emotional attachment between Alice and her mother exists and forms the underlying relationship between the two and the association with the kidnaps taking place. The complex relationship between Alice and her mother places Alice at the center of the kidnapping. Hellen is disgusted by Alice to the point of considering Ronnie her child of choice, a position that makes Alice deeply insecure. Moreover, the tension in interracial affairs is associated with the second kidnapping and having born a biracial child while in prison, and given it up for adoption, Alice becomes the primary suspect in the case (Berg). Alice’s mother, the mastermind behind the kidnap, in the first and second cases, and murder, in the first case, plants evidence to ensure Alice stands out as the main suspect. Hellen, through betrayal and deception, purposely Alice ends up in prison (Berg). Further, compared to the indifference in Ronnie’s parents, there is no emotional attachment between the parents and their daughters. As the film comes to an end, the audience learns that not only were Alice and Ronnie falsely imprisoned, the justice system failed to prove that Helen is the killer.",
    "The article describes a recent Chicago hot dog restaurant incident that can be considered an ethical issue. The incident involved a man who was asked to wear a mask to use the restaurant’s services (Sutton, 2022). In response, the man offended the restaurant employee by throwing snow in their face several times (Sutton, 2022). Additionally, the offender broke the glass door with an unknown object (Sutton, 2022). This incident can be considered an ethical issue because the offender’s actions were disproportional to the situation, apart from the obvious property damage offense. Furthermore, throwing snow at an employee might not count as illegal; however, it is blatantly disrespectful toward an individual. A utilitarian point of view would consider this incident wrong by examining the consequences of the offender’s actions. The seeming reason behind the offender’s behavior is the employee’s request to wear a mask, which is the state’s mandate. Utilitarianism would view the restaurant visitor’s decision to commit an offense against the employee and the restaurant’s property, starting with the consequences of these actions. Since the result is a broken glass door and an innocent employee that suffered, the consequences are harmful. As such, from the utilitarian point of view, the actions can be considered wrong. The Kantian moral theory views an issue as irrational since following the moral law and duty is rational behavior. Offering an innocent individual and damaging the restaurant’s property can be immoral. As such, dismissing the moral law renders the offender irrational in the eyes of a follower of a Kantian moral theory. I believe that utilitarianism is the most logical way to conclude this ethical problem. The reason for that is that negative consequences for anybody can be the best moral compass for almost any decision. The Kantian moral theory is based on moral law, which can be subjective in some people’s minds. As such, according to Kantian theory, some people might disagree that the incident is an ethical issue. In contrast, according to utilitarianism, a negative impact on any individual renders an action wrong.",
    "The primary source for this study is the general medical journal The Lancet. It publishes the survey data and provides statistics and a comparative analysis of the obtained quantitative information. The Economist can be seen as a secondary source that describes research with less digital content. The study represents a decrease in the HIV infection rate of girls in school by stabilizing their families’ financial difficulties. The World Bank funded the study to demonstrate the value of money in reducing the spread of HIV among young, poor girls. The study was authored by Berk Özler, Lead Economist and Poverty Research Manager. The medical journal The Lancet presented statistics based on a survey in the Zomba district of Malawi (G.C. 2). The Economist later summarized the study with the most critical findings from the analysis. Thus, 1,300 unmarried girls aged 13 to 22 took part in the study. This is a sufficient number of subjects to consider the prevalence of HIV in poor areas. The sampling took place with the help of a computer, so the girls fell into different experimental groups randomly. Thus, a group stood out in which girls and their families were given small amounts of money every month, girls paid to attend school, and girls left without financial support. Based on the study, it can be concluded that the subjects who received the money in both groups showed a significant reduction in the spread of the virus. However, test subjects with no money were forced to look for a sugar daddy. Therefore, in this group of issues, the statistics of the spread of HIV were preserved. Thus, the drug called money is adequate and affects the spread of STDs. The implication is that the global community needs funding to stop the spread of HIV. However, research and further assistance to young girls have several limitations. Firstly, it is hard to understand how much money each person needs to stop looking for sugar daddies and move on with their lives. Moreover, the study was conducted over 18 months, so it is impossible to assess how it will work in the long term",
    "Horror films have become one of the fundamental genres of cinema, the popularity of which is not inferior to the other styles. The reason for it is the specific reaction of the target audience, namely a powerful emotional impulse. Moreover, it becomes a psychological relief for some persons, which helps to distract from one’s problems. Horror films are not the modern version of public lynching; they formulate a way for people to obtain a strong emotional response through fear. Fear is a primary human emotion, which manifests itself as an instinct for self-preservation, namely a reaction to a potential threat. It may seem strange for one that people pay money to feel such an unpleasant emotion while watching horror films. However, in the essay Why We Crave Horror Movies , Stephen King argued that people aim to re-establish their feelings of essential normality (King, 1). In other words, one tries to reset their ordinary feelings for many reasons. Some are distracting from problems in this way, others get a dose of adrenaline, and sometimes horror films become a way to throw out their emotions in a movie theater and not on other people. Any art must evoke emotion and promote the individual experiencing ethical pleasure. Watching horror movies seems to have nothing to do with the ethical aspect. However, the success of horror movies, to more extent than other genres, depends on the audience’s reaction (Glasby, 7). The strong reaction makes horror films stand out in terms of the criteria for assessing art. Indeed, few people can lag behind absolutely indifferent when watching scary scenes. Besides, the powerful emotional response makes horror films so popular and successful nowadays. To conclude, one identified that horror films do not formulate a form of modern public lynching. They are the one’s method to receive the bright, emotive response. There are various reasons for it, beginning from obtaining psychological discharge and ending to distracting from reality and one’s urgent problems. The audience’s reaction is the key point to evaluating the horror film’s success and why it is considered art.",
    "A mutation is a change in the genome of an organism. Most commonly, mutations are defined as changes in DNA structure that occur due to disruption of the sequence of genes or the emergence of new genes. In this paper, I would like to talk about spontaneous mutations. Spontaneous mutations occur by chance – for example if a sheep is suddenly born in a flock of sheep with shorter legs; such mutations can also occur in humans. The ADRB1 gene, for example, is responsible for regulating the amount of sleep a person needs each night to function properly. Most humans need eight hours of sleep or more, but about 5% of the population enjoys a slightly different mutant version. Tests done on a mother and daughter who had the mutation revealed the ability to sleep only 4 to 6 hours each night (Servick, 2019). This mutation refers to a type of genomic mutation. The protein encoded by the mutation is a receptor for norepinephrine. This mutation is dominant, autosomal, and beneficial in its effect on the viability of individuals. Changes in the ADRB1 gene occur primarily in humans. However, they can also be in animals, although no studies have yet been conducted. Such a mutation does not affect the human population in the general world. This is mainly due to the fact that it is not dangerous and is not life-threatening to its carriers. Thus, such a mutation is only a positive addition to the life abilities of a human carrier. This mutation is sporadic and is not a dominant trend in population genome changes despite its dominance. I find this example interesting because natural changes in the human genome open up new possibilities for the population. Thus, studying such changes is essential for human development and a deeper study of human capabilities.",
    "In his graphic novel, Spiegelman uses a literary device known as anthropomorphism to show the difference between races, including Americans, the Germans, and the Jews. This device makes the severe issue seem simpler to understand, and the readers pay more attention to the ideas expressed by the author. In Maus , Spiegelman portrays the horrors of the holocaust and reminds the readers that the holocaust’s victims and survivors also had their own lives and dreams. The first section to be discussed is Chapter 1 – “The Sheik.” In this section, the main character Artie asks his father Vladek to tell him about his life during the war. Instead of describing the horrors Vladek faced during the holocaust, he prefers to tell his son about his happy and careless life in 1935 (Spiegelman, 1980, pp. 13-23). This desire to recall the good old days proves that the victims of the war prefer to remember the pleasant times. The second section is Chapter 3- “Prisoner of War.” In this part of the novel, Vladek talks about the first events he witnessed as a soldier. Interestingly, Vladek remembers the name of a soldier he killed, and this detail shows that even during the terrible events, one’s brain catches the small and unmeaningful things (Spiegelman, 1980, p. 50). Finally, Vladek says that he was reunited with his family, and this event matters more than what he experienced as a prisoner of war. The third part to analyze is Chapter 5 – “Mouse Holes.” This section shows that, for many mice, war is a series of difficult decisions that must be made in order for them to try to survive (Spiegelman, 1980). Even when parents learn about the death of their children, they need to keep a cold mind so as not to get caught by the cats. To draw a conclusion, one may say that this graphic novel is a unique literary work about World War II. In these comic drawings, Spiegelman managed to portray the horrors of the holocaust and those little but meaningful things that supported the victims and helped some of them to remain hopeful. Despite the fact that the war was full of violence and murders, the author shows the irony of the situation – the Germans are just animals who imagine they are better than others.",
    "The creation of a web-based system to store the university’s information on students and their transcripts presents certain risks that need to be addressed in the feasibility report. Using the standard risk evaluation process, it is possible to differentiate the risks into two large groups. These are risks to the continuation and completion of the project and risks to the end product’s performance after the project has been completed. The risks to the continuation and completion of the project are as follows:   * Unforeseen delays and time expenditures. It is possible that the project’s implementation will be more complex than anticipated, requiring more time;   * Individuals participating in the project might become sick and slow down production;   * The available hardware and software may malfunction. The risks for the performance of the end product are as follows:   * The product might not be secure enough to be allowed to work with personal student data;   * The product would be economically unfeasible to run;   * The product would not perform adequately to the university’s requirements. Time-related problems could be identified by comparing the progress made with the timeline developed before starting the project. Functionality and requirements risks can be discovered by matching the product against its requirements for it, as well as through testing during specific project milestones. Potential time constraints and personnel/hardware breakages can be accounted for by allocating more time to the project than initially estimated to allow for replacements to be made. Countering the risks associated with site performance would be more difficult and largely have a reactionary nature, should some of them not be discovered and remedied during the product testing phase.",
    "The computation of the three ratios Return on Assets (RoA) Return on Equity (RoE) Profit Margin The purpose and information conveyed by each ratios The three ratios presented and computed in the previous section represent vital profit generation indicators for a modern commercial organization. The return on assets (RoA) shows how well the company utilizes the entirety of its assets, including the borrowed ones, to generate financial returns. The return on equity is largely similar to this metric, but it does not consider the debt of the company (Gallo, 2016). Finally, the profit margin is one of the most important indicators of financial health, as it draws a direct comparison between sales and profits, showing how much the company actually earns from its operations. ABC Company review on three ratios First of all, the ABC Company’s business model can be deemed successful, as it generates adequate profits. Optimal returns on equity and assets show that the investors can reasonably expect returns on their participation in the company’s financing. The profit margin is also considerable, which means that this aspect of the firm is handled well. The profitability of the company Overall, the ABC Company remains a profitable enterprise that successfully converts its assets into revenues. The profit margin is over 50%, which is commendable, even though the overall turnover is below $1 million. Therefore, the business model on its own functions well, allowing the ABC Company to retain a stable position on the market. However, it may not suffice for the sustained growth in the long-term. ABC Company financial successful While the ABC Company’s financial statement may present positive indicators, it would be unwise to consider the company in isolation. Instead, it appears to interesting to compare the entity’s performance against the industry’s leaders to identify the areas in which it excels or where the improvements are needed. First of all, the return on assets is provided by Rose (2022), indicating that the industry’s average was set at 9.1-9.3% across the past four years. The ABC Company’s figures are considerably higher at the moment with 28.3%, but it is important to note that its absolute cash flows are not on par with the industry’s leaders. Thus, it is possible that the ABC Company’s ratios will become lower as the entity continues to grow. This difference becomes particularly evident when the income levels are compared with the industry’s average figures. As far as net income is concerned, the industry has averaged at $4.7 million in 2020. The ABC Company is far from this level, as its net income is only $77,000, which implies that it still has a long growth phase ahead. Furthermore, the industry’s leaders, such as Williams-Sonoma, have hundreds of millions of sales, whereas the ABC Company only has half-a-million. As the total assets of the company increase, there is no guarantee that its profit margins and returns on investment will remain equally high. Under these circumstances, the emphasis will be on maintaining the profitability of operations above the average level across the industry.",
    "Portraying the lives of gods and depicting relationships between them, as well as their interactions with humans, both “Iliad” and “Metamorphosis” elaborate on the theme of power abuse by those at the helm. In “Iliad,” Agamemnon has to face retribution due to his constant abuse of power: “be ready, that I be not left,/Alone of all the Greeks, without my prize” (Homer, 762 B. C.). Likewise, in “Metamorphosis,” various deities display complete disrespect for those of lesser power: “What had escaped the waves, now feared the flame” (Ovid, 8 B.C.). However, unlike the “Iliad,” “Metamorphosis” rarely demonstrates the comeuppance that deities have to face for their negligence of mortals’ needs (Homer, 762 B. C.; Ovid, 8 B. C.). Therefore, while thematically similar, “Iliad” and “Metamorphosis” represent slightly different perspectives on the problem o power abuse. The theme of mortals’ protection, which is central both to “Iliad” and “Metamorphosis,” remains essential nowadays as well. Namely, a range of contemporary leaders appear to have tremendous amounts of power due to their political influence, their economic one, or a combination of both (Homer, 762 B. C.; Ovid, 8 B. C.). For instance, the disregard for human rights in countries such as China, where leaders attain the status of god-like creatures, can be seen as similar to the one in the “Iliad” and “Metamorphosis.” However, what makes “Metamorphosis” slightly less effective in this regard is the comedic manner in which it portrays the abuse of mortals. In turn, “Iliad,” being a more serious work, produces a much greater impact by condemning the violence of omnipotent gods toward humans, which is more in line with the current concept of power abuse. Nevertheless, both the “Iliad” and “Metamorphosis” carry an important message and a deep meaning. Providing an insight into power dynamics within Ancient Greek society, they also help recognize similar patterns in the modern community.",
    "The article of Zulaika (2022) presents the impact of COVID-19 lockdowns on adolescent pregnancy and school dropout among secondary school girls in Kenya. The cases of teenage pregnancy started in Kenya after the country-wide school closure that started from March 2020 and lasted until January 2021. Zulaika (2022) examine to what extent the pandemic affected sexual and reproductive health of adolescents in Rarieda subcounty. The study shows there was a limited involvement of health administrators on the issue of pregnancy among school girls. Teenagers lack sexual education and are not aware of different methods of protection. Health administrators should find this issue important as early pregnancy can be dangerous for girls’ health and lead to various socio-economic problems in the future. Moreover, if such a rate of adolescent pregnancy continues to increase, there would be less educated females in Kenya. Zulaika (2022) also mentions that stress level of pregnant teenagers is high, affecting mental as well as physical health of young future mothers. To tackle this issue, Zulaika (2022) suggests implementing population-level emergencies on girls that are going to school. Students should be educated for the basics of sexual education and for the side effects of sexual life. Furthermore, the article points out that infectious diseases can be spread rapidly if school girls do not know the importance of contraceptives. As such, there is a need to the national project of informing school students and their parents about sexual and reproductive issues. The effects of COVID-19 on teenage pregnancy are negative, causing additional social and economic problems not only for the pregnant girls and their families but also for the whole country.",
    "Primarily, one should note that the country that I chose to perform the assignment is France. Undoubtedly, there are many consulates of France in the United States. However, to take the remains to the “homeland,” it is required to contact a special consulate general located in California, Los Angeles. In this context, a “mourner” should arrange a meeting in the office with a specialist two days in advance to discuss all the details and points regarding the dispatch of human remains and sealing an urn ( Shipment of cremated remains , 2019). Thus, the Consulate General of France in Los Angeles is one of the most relevant places to ask for help to remove “remnants.” Accordingly, I have to provide the following merchandise to the family in the future. First of all, it is necessary to prepare a package of particular documents. For instance, they include a death certificate of a loved one in the US, a medical report, and a certificate of cremation and sealing. Moreover, an attestation of the absence of extraneous attachments and closed sealing of the urn, a certificate of the lack of infectious diseases from the deceased, and a permit to import remains will be required. It is also essential to have a person’s permission to request repatriation and a certified French translation of the death and cremation certificate. Secondly, this family needs an urn with the ashes of the dead, located in a special airtight container. Moreover, there are not too complicated requirements regarding the transportation of the urn in France. A person must apply directly to the French consulate in the US and prepare a package of documents set out above. There are several airlines engaged in the transportation of ashes, one of the most reliable and well-known is Air France-KLM. In most cases, the tame frames are based on an agreement between funeral companies in America and the destination country. The consulate member I have had to communicate with is Julie Duhaut-Bedos. In addition, the flight booking service would be accompanied by the consulate’s help. Depending on the distance, it is necessary to book a direct flight or with a transfer. Furthermore, each airline offers individual conditions for the transportation of special cargo. The urn with the ashes of a loved one would be carefully sealed and placed in a special lockable box with dense walls. Transporting the loved one by plane is possible only in the luggage compartment.",
    "Amazon has grown to become one of the most important companies in the US. Millions of people rely on the highly efficient deliveries and cheap prices. Moreover, the company has turned into one of the largest employees, as numerous Amazon fulfillment centers are scattered across the country. With such scale, a wide range of issues inevitably arise. Recently the multiple complaints concerning the way Amazon treats it workers have managed to draw public attention. Therefore, a dedicate analysis is need in order to understand what kind of working conditions and atmosphere the IT giant provides. Key Problems: Job Dissatisfaction and High Turnover Rates Guaranteeing $15 an hour may be a nice incentive for people in poor neighborhoods, but only in the short run. Motivating people to work better by gradually increasing their pay would be not only more appealing and psychologically comfortable, but also highly beneficial in the long run. Task assignments and worker motivation interact through the extent of labor market competition – that is, the possibility of moving to another firm (Bar-Isaac & Levy, 2022). Therefore, Amazon should consider applying a more traditional approach to motivating workers, which will help to reduce current turnover rates. Cause: Poor Motivation Techniques E-commerce is no longer as lucrative as it used to be a decade ago. It has become the primary way people do shopping, especially in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic. Therefore, numerous new companies have jumped at the opportunity and managed to extend their market shares. Thus, Amazon is determined to cut costs substantially by various means, including the construction of its fulfillment centres in the neighborhoods that have not fully recovered from recent economic recessions. According to Kinicki (2020), turnover is one of the major outcomes that should be considered while tailoring the set of inputs. Currently, the company’s turnover rate continues to be extremely high. Desired Solution: Utilizing More Conservative Motivation Frameworks The emphasis on fear, the discouragement of camaraderie and many other Amazon’s current policies substantially undermine employee’s motivation and the company’s public image. The desired potential solution plan includes the introduction of systematic pay raises, the enhancement of bonus systems and changing the way employees are timed. These steps will help the IT giant to motivate employees in a much more positive and respectful way.",
    "American slavery arose as a way of exploiting labor within capitalism but gradually took shape in an autonomous socio-economic and political structure. Over time, a liberation movement began, which implied the illegality and unethical “ownership” of people. However, even after official emancipation, the slaves were dependent on the state and slave owners in the past, with a lack of resources for subsistence. Without documents, financial resources, and moral support, it was difficult for new members of society to integrate into a standard life. Additionally, discrimination and lack of inclusion as a phenomenon continued to exist. Slavery was abolished as a result of the Civil War between the northern and southern states. The passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to the US Constitution in January 1865 brought a permanent end to slavery in the US, making it illegal and anti-constitutional. Currently, this phenomenon in the United States is considered one of the most shameful episodes in the history of the country. At the same time, an urgent question arises whether the state should have compensated the slaves for the material and spiritual damage that was caused to them in the process. Even if slave labor is not officially permitted and the slaves are freed, without the provision of basic resources for life, survival is unlikely. The concept and attitude of society also affect the acceptance rate of new members. In the case of unequal chances of receiving the same benefits, the slaves in the past have more difficulties, challenges, and complexities on the path of integration. In this regard, the new slaves were not truly emancipated, as they were still dependent on a source of resources for subsistence.",
    "The present essay analyzes a manual for the use of a dishwasher developed by Bosch. The first positive characteristic of this manual is that it contains a lot of illustrations that make it easier to understand how to use the dishwasher. For instance, the manual depicts how to add rinse aid, arrange crockery in the dishwasher, and remove baskets (Bosch, n.d.). Thus, the manual is focused on its audience, who is not expected to know very well how to use the dishwasher. Besides, the section on the installation of the machine is not detailed and contains only fundamental suggestions. Hence, the authors of the manual expect it to be installed by professionals. Another reason that proves that this manual focuses on the audience is that the largest part of the text is presented in the form of bullet points. Therefore, a user could easily and quickly find all necessary information in the manual. The manual is problem-oriented, purposeful, and persuasive because it addresses precise issues that users might face. For example, it explains how to select the right program for specific types of crockery and food remains, cancel and stop the program, and check the condition of the machine. Even though the text is written without technical terminology, the manual remains professional. This conclusion is based on the fact that in the instruction, one could find answers to a wide range of specific questions. The manual contains instructions on how to use the dishwasher, take care of it, install, dispose of wastes, and what to do in case of a failure. As it has already been mentioned, the examined manual is designed-centered. It contains numerous illustrations, schemes, and bullet points that make it easy to read. What is more, near the paragraphs with warnings, a related sign is inserted. The exclamation point in a red triangle draws the attention of a reader and makes him or her focus on the content of the section. The manual is also logical: the first section is dedicated to the components of the dishwasher; in the second one, the manual tells the audience how to put tableware in it. Afterward, there is information on how to add water softener, salt, and rinse aid. Finally, the manual explains how to take care of the device and how to act in case of a problem.",
    "Referring to competition’s nature, the competitive landscape covers multiple aspects, including, the number and size of companies, their weaknesses and strengths, barriers to the market entry and exit, and substitutes’ threats. In the present day, it substantially differs from the traditional competitive environment that relied on large advertising budgets and economies of scale – and it continues to transform due to rapid technological progress. Due to constantly changing conditions, the contemporary competitive mindset is characterized by innovation, integration, flexibility, and speed. It relies on data in business decision-making in order to have competitive advantages and create transparent business processes, adapts to the latest market technologies, and aims to improve the consumer experience. In general, in order to stay competitive, the majority of companies focus on customer-oriented operations to meet people’s demands and strengthen brand awareness and loyalty. There are several drivers of the current competitive landscape, including new business models, consumer protection, price transparency, hypercompetition, and environmental awareness, however, the primary ones are flexibility and technologies. In other words, companies cannot implement only one strategy for stable growth and development and should use all technological advantages to outperform competitors. Thus, those companies that are flexible, apply various approaches, and see opportunities may succeed even in tough economic conditions. For instance, NVIDIA, a multinational technology company that designs graphics processing and chip units for professional markets, gaming, and mobile computing, performs excellently regardless of the COVID-19 recession. The company has taken advantage of a global lockdown and people’s self-isolation focusing on remote computing services and video gaming. For instance, approximately seven million Nintendo gaming consoles with NVIDIA’s chips were sold in the third quarter of 2020 (Fitch, 2020). This case demonstrates that in the current competitive landscape, those companies who may rapidly adapt to any conditions will be able to stay productive and highly demanded.",
    "Guaman Poma witnessed the injustices of the colonial government and personally suffered by its hands. He was the descendant of Incan noblemen who grew up after the conquest of Peru by the Spanish. His family was stripped of their lands and titles, and his attempts to regain them were continuously rebuffed by the colonial government (Kilroy-Ewbank, n.d.). Although he initially worked with the colonialists, Poma was exiled for supposedly false claims of nobility and then decided to publicly denounce the Spanish treatment of natives. He published a 1200-page illustrated document addressed to the Spanish king, chronicling the Andean way of life before invasion and the abuses they had suffered since under the Conquistadors. Poma’s manuscript illustrates the full horrors of colonialism and argues that the Spanish were foreign settlers who had no right to take control of the land God had given to Peruvians. He proposes a system of political organization wherein the government is representative of its people and adapted to their practical needs (Kilroy-Ewbank, n.d.). Poma has thus made a significant contribution to the discussions of liberty, political representation, social responsibility, and self-determinacy of individual states. His notion that the government should be created for and by the people that have historically occupied the land it rules over is strikingly modern. Furthermore, Poma’s work completely refutes the idea that Europeans brought civilization and political organization to the Incas. This interpretation is revealed as only a hypocritical pretense to justify violence, economic exploitation, and cultural erasure as a means of political control. It portrays how an entire way of life was completely destroyed and lost as its people were deprived of their freedom and forced to assimilate. Although Poma admires the moral standards the Spanish purport to uphold, he shows that they have not actually measured up to them.",
    "Background The action of the prayer effect is based on the regularities and peculiarities of cognitive processes. It is based on two attention abilities, namely, switching and concentration. In the course of prayer, people switch and focus on an area of higher spirituality. The requirement of regularity and systematic recitation of worship leads to frequent repetition of concentration on religious categories, strengthening the mental connection with God. Froese and Jones (2021) wrote in their article that prayer strengthens one’s faith in the supernatural and, therefore, it is a session of faith. In addition, public prayer has long been used as a tool to influence the political arena (Froese & Jones, 2021). Therefore, one can consider this phenomenon as a weapon, sacred and supernatural. The same idea that prayer is a weapon, and used politically, is also found in Martin’s article. Religion is familiar with precedents when it was possible to defeat enemy troops by force of turning to God (Martin, 2019). For example, in A.D. 174, by the power of prayer, a Roman legion was able to discover a spring of water, and the flood that followed washed away the enemies (Martin, 2019). In general, both authors emphasize that prayers serve as weapons and that their use brings people closer to God. Participants in the ritual often experience a sense of social acceptance and emotional uplift after the prayer is completed. The rhythmic and systematic repetition of prayers reinforces the ideals and guidelines of a particular religion (Froese & Jones, 2021). Martin also wrote about it in his article, he came to the conclusion that these circumstances determine why prayer can be used as an epiphany strategy. Proactivity manifests itself as a response to a stimulus; a prayer of this type responds to a vision for fate. Due to such rituals, it is possible to create the future by praying (Froese & Jones, 2021). People often asked God to protect them in battle throughout early Christian history. Prayers were used to ease the fear of the Israelites, strengthening their resolve long before Jesus was born (Martin, 2019). The initiators of such prayers were used to reassure soldiers before skirmishes. It was assured that they would be guaranteed a place in heaven if they won (Martin, 2019). Both authors mention that requests for intervention in this way have existed throughout Christian history. They are unanimously convinced that prayers are inherently proactive; there are no significant differences between their positions. Summary Repentance In his second letter to the Corinthians, Paul refers to repentance as sorrow for God’s sake, which leads to salvation (2 Corinthians 7:10). Repentance in Paul’s understanding is when one does not return to sin again. Repentance cleanses the soul, and a clean soul, in turn, is able to more fully receive the grace of the Holy Spirit.

    "Supporters of relativism believe that morality in the objective sense does not exist. The moral norms adopted in society are not obligatory for adherence and execution. In absolute terms, the concepts of evil and good are nothing more than fiction. In this regard, researcher Porus noted that moral relativism could easily degenerate into permissiveness (Bush and Moss, 2020). Moreover, people who adhere to this point of view can be perceived as the ones trying to devalue moral norms to the lowest possible level, will not attempt to seek compromises and negotiate on mutually beneficial terms. On the contrary, objectivism states that there is right and wrong that do not depend on someone’s opinions or other factors. In this sense, moral standards are believed to be propounded and everlasting, not created by humans. There are many philosophical variations and interpretations of objectivism, but the key idea lies in proclaiming one genuine truth. This evidently opposes the concept of relativism in every aspect (Bush and Moss, 2020). Objectivism, however, admits that some moral norms may change, but at thy core, any rules and standards evolve around an unaltered understanding of bad and good. I find relativism more convincing despite some flaws it contains. Although absolute relativity often signals the absence of a moral and ethical core and is thus unreliable, the theory of relativism has more realistic features. Every day we face elections, the result of which often cannot be called correct or not. Most people, in principle, always try to act ethically, but even then, their actions can be perceived negatively. You will not please everyone precisely because, despite some existing ideas about good and evil, you make decisions that pass through the prism of experience, psychological characteristics of a person, circumstances, and weighing many factors. I find objectivism too utopian an ultimatum, which seeks to simplify morality while threatening it with a distorted view of reality.",
    "Cryptocurrencies are a controversial topic in society, as their volatility puts their long-term validity into question. However, older blockchain coins have failed to deliver a scalable and secure currency that will be as decentralized as possible (Hamilton, 2022). Unlike Bitcoin and Etherium, Solana has multiple advantages that make it a worthwhile investment. For this proposal, I would like to highlight the benefits of this cryptocurrency to a business university graduate. Solana is not the newest cryptocurrency, yet it is one with the highest potential. Other blockchains possess a small capacity for transactions, as their operations per second make them unfeasible (Locke, 2021). However, this currency transfers faster and has incomparably small transaction fees (Farrington, 2021). An investment in Solana is a safer choice among cryptocurrencies, yet it has the potential to multiply one’s savings. Safety and speed of transactions are the reasons behind the high chances for future widespread usage of Solana (Hamilton, 2022). My proposed idea is to capitalize on Solana’s recent success on the market, as this currency was up 12000% in the past year (Locke, 2021). I think that this subject deserves more attention, as cryptocurrencies provide a unique take on financial interactions, yet their current state disallows companies to utilize them efficiently. Solana has the potential to overcome these barriers and turn into a globally accepted currency. In conclusion, Solana is a cryptocurrency that is worth one’s attention, as it has several benefits that make it a better choice for investment than other similar coins. Its current solid position on the market and strong backing from a cryptocurrency community is a perfect indication of future prospects. It might be necessary to analyze Solana’s carbon footprint to prove its potential for a long-term success.",
    "Yoga is a concept that signifies a set of spiritual, mental, and physical practices aimed at managing the cognitive and physiological functions of the body. Practicing this sport allows one to broaden the horizons, change the habitual way of life, and eliminate harmful patterns that negate the efforts. That is why yoga is considered the most effective practice of self-development that has unique benefits for health, both physical and psychological. There are numerous varieties of modern yoga; despite the dissimilarities, they are grounded on shared parts: body postures, breathing exercises, and spiritual contemplation. The combination of exercises that train the body and soul has unique health benefits. It strengthens muscles, increases flexibility, and enhances mental soundness. Moreover, yoga classes have enormous therapeutic potential and preventive effects. Studies involving patients with various musculoskeletal conditions have indicated that yoga helps to reduce pain and improve joint mobility (Saeed et al., 2019). Breathing exercises relax the muscles that constrict the airways and strengthen oxygen diffusion, leading to better lung function. One of the chief yoga concepts is the “eight limbs,” which consists of alternating stages for achieving a state of enlightenment. Eight steps are a prerequisite for everyone to feel connected to the world. Through these practices, one learns to control one’s actions, accept all hardships calmly, and find compromises. The ultimate goal of the methodology is to learn to find a balance between one’s own and the world’s values and understand that each person has an essential mission in the community. It significantly affects an individual’s social well-being as it seeks to bring body, mind, and soul into unison (Saeed et al., 2019). The balance of these essential elements ensures a healthy and harmonious personality, activates energy potential, and prevents psychological stress. In conclusion, yoga is essential for promoting health and combating social isolation and depression. It can be used for physical development, healing, and emotional restoration. Yoga is based on a holistic approach that helps the whole body return to a normal state. It makes it an indispensable and beneficial self-development practice for the health of both adults and children.",
    "Theodor Adorno’s concept of industrial culture implied a strong connection between capitalist society and the products capitalism produces in the cultural sphere to enhance the existing social practices that benefit the further development of capitalism. Therefore, Adorno suggested that most media products, such as films, books, television programs, reinforce the population’s belief in capitalist values. On the other hand, the structural functionalism theory approaches society as a living organism, where each part of society plays its function in the viability maintenance of the whole organism. Therefore, even though the concepts have similarities in equally prioritizing the importance of stability in society, their differences can be more apparent through application to modern culture and society. In his theory, Adorno pointed at the obvious narrative of mass media products, such as films and books, where wealth is often associated with happiness. However, another example with a more apparent connection to reinforcing capitalism is entertainment for children. From a very young age, modern children are exposed to different sorts of media in the form of tv shows, cartoons, and animated films. In the structural functionalism approach, the entertainment industry for children presents a source of education and emotional development. In different forms, the children’s entertainment industry teaches them important moral practices of being kind and polite to other people, which serves as the foundation for security in the future society. However, in the industrial culture approach, modern children’s entertainment is focused on selling the merchandise of different characters featured in films. For example, one of the most influential companies, Disney, invented the business model of using cartoon characters to attract children to their theme parks (Clement, 2018). Now, the company strategically plans simultaneous launches of animated films and merchandise with the films’ characters to ensure financial benefit.",
    "Archetypes describe such characteristics, which are universal patterns that define certain events, objects, or people. In literature, they describe representations and concepts that are common to all people, which allow people to understand and interpret stories. However, archetypes also exist in everyday life and play a significant role in shaping the perception of the world around them. In particular, there are archetypes of people that help determine their character and actions, as well as motivation. Applying this concept to everyday life, one can single out special types of people who have a set of common and exclusive characteristics for them. They are formed both on the basis of the actions and inclinations of the person and depending on the environment. An example of an archetype in everyday life is the head of a large modern corporation, such as Elon Musk. He can be defined as a hero or creator who has the inspiration and courage to change the world around him. Other people perceive it in this way, which makes it a great example of an archetype. All his actions are motivated precisely by these characteristics, and his primary motivation is the transformation of the world. The presence of archetypes in everyday life allows me to compose a more comprehensive perception of people and events. In particular, based on the characteristics I know, I can determine the motivation and role of a certain person, which makes him more predictable. This is certainly more difficult than may be presented in the literature because people often have mixed features. However, in general, the concept of archetypes gives me the opportunity to understand the actions of people and their characters. I can later use this information to form my own relationship with them.",
    "Introduction The shifts in attitudes of people towards romantic relationships and, more specifically, marriage are attributes of societal development. From this perspective, the trends common for Gen Z are incredibly informative and, therefore, used for analyzing the situation in this area (Klein, 2022). It is clear that individuals’ mindsets are formed under the influence of external circumstances, which implies the correlation of opinions about love and sex with the presence of threats to personal well-being. Hence, one cannot examine the accompanying phenomena and cause-and-effect relationships while neglecting either the human factor or the conditions of the environment. One of the articles devoted to the subject is “Are Gen Z more pragmatic about love and sex?” and its critical analysis can reveal the elements of effective writing intended for considering complex events. Summary of the Article In the selected piece, Jessica Klein narrates the tendency for representatives of Gen Z to postpone marriage and avoid long-term relationships while prioritizing personal issues. Compared to previous generations, these individuals do not view this area as a natural condition for entering adulthood due to a number of reasons. First, the advantages of single life are more attractive than settling down and help them satisfy their need for introspection (Klein, 2022). Second, people in this group adopt a pragmatic approach to the matter because they understand the necessity of gaining stability in life in order to have a family (Klein, 2022). Third, Gen Zers face more problems than their parents due to the pandemic and prefer to reflect on the kind of person they want to be partners with and choose them carefully (Klein, 2022). As a result, the processes in this area slow down significantly, and the primary focus on self, as opposed to interactions with others, justify the changes which happened to this part of human life. Response Evidence The examined article is an effective piece of writing due to the inclusion of evidence from numerous sources, both of qualitative and quantitative nature. Thus, Klein (2022) refers to multiple studies related to the subject under consideration, including surveys conducted among the target population and statistical data gathered by official institutions. More importantly, she analyzes the current tendencies in the relationships of Gen Z through the lens of the experience of previous generations (Klein, 2022). This approach to the task makes the findings more credible compared to a possible orientation on the information received from the participants and, consequently, confirms the reliability of conclusions for conducting further research. The overall extensiveness of this publication is also supported by the inclusion of personal opinions alongside the studies mentioned above (Klein, 2022). In this way, the selection of appropriate instruments for the purposes of this article is one of its main advantages. External and Internal Factors",
    "From 2016 to 2018, this study summarizes sport fisheries in the Anchorage Management Area. They contained a description and historical background of each sport fishery, as well as information on how each fishery is now managed, as well as performance and escapement data for 2016–2018. According to the report, reductions in the number and size of fish available for release in locally stocked lakes have had a detrimental impact on local fisheries’ popularity and productivity. It should be mentioned that because this source gives statistical data, it may be trusted. All of this will surely be beneficial to the study, as official data must be considered. The sport fisheries in the North Gulf Coast Management Area are discussed in this study. A summary and overview of each fishery are included, and information on how the fisheries are managed and fishery performance and escapement from 2016 to 2018. This report is provided by the official department that controls fishing activities in Alaska. However, it should be noted that this source can be considered reliable as it provides statistical information. All this will undoubtedly be useful for research since it is necessary to take into account official data. The intricacy of variables that restrict or encourage diversity in Alaskan fisheries, one of the world’s most important fishing locations, is examined in this case study. They looked at changes in participation and portfolio variety in Alaskan fisheries over three decades using a mix of harvest statistics and literature reviews. The four case studies looked at how fishers, fleets, and communities responded to various interconnected stressors, such as biological decreases, market and pricing dynamics, and fisheries privatization. Experts also verified this article, which is reflected in the reliability and accuracy of the information provided. It will be useful for research because it reflects current trends and factors affecting the spread of sport fishing.",
    "Deductive reasoning involves the construction and development of cause-and-effect solid relationships. It is noteworthy that the connection is established either between two facts or a point and the idea of how it will affect the future (Besnard & Hunter, 2018). Thus, a judgment (logical expression) includes the first – the prerequisites, the second – the conclusion. In logic, an argument is valid only when it has a form that makes it impossible for the premises to be correct and the judgment to be wrong. According to the explained three types of deductive arguments, a valid statement does not need to have actually trustworthy premises. Still, it must have ones that, if they were accurate, would guarantee that the conclusion is proper. Example:  1. All metals are heavy  2. Tin is a metal  3. Tin is heavy A sound argument must have both a valid form and true premises. Valid arguments can be unsound, but they will have wrong assumptions. Example:  1. All dogs are cats  2. All mice are dogs  3. All mice are cats What makes this a valid statement is not that it has trustworthy premises and a proper conclusion but the logical necessity of the judgment, given the two assumptions. The argument would be just as valid if the premises and conclusion were wrong. However, it is essential to determine that the purpose of argumentation is to establish the truth of a judgment. An invalid argument does not achieve this goal, so it cannot be considered sound (Besnard & Hunter, 2018). A sound argument has a valid form and true premises; thus, it cannot be invalid in all cases. If the argument is invalid, then the beliefs thoroughly do not matter, and, in fact, only the conclusion remains. Therefore, this means that there is no argument in this case, especially a sound one.",
    "Aristotle made a discovery fundamental to all logic by introducing variables. Thus, it was shown that logic is not just a specific doctrine of specific things or terms, but the science of the laws of syllogisms, such as modus ponens or modus tollens, expressed in variables. Studying various judgments, formal logic abstracts from their specific content, revealing a structure common to objects of different content. Syllogism is the discovery of Aristotle and is the main and most original part of his logic. In the theory of syllogisms, Aristotle defined syllogism and distinguished its types, defined working and non-working types of syllogisms, and established three figures of syllogism. I find it particularly interesting that Aristotle was the first to make reasoning methods the subject of scientific research. He introduced the methods of reasoning as integral formations and not just certain reasoning components. Everything that was done in logic before Aristotle just attempted to understand individual methods and principles without any systematization and unification into a single coherent system. Thus, such concepts as Modus ponens and Modus tollens laid the foundation for understanding the definition of the truth of thinking. Thus, I am amazed at how accurately Aristotle introduced the concepts of conclusions that approach science by the rules of inference, the laws of contradiction, and the exclusion of the third. Modern logic as an independent field of knowledge arose from such different sciences as philosophy and mathematics. Being indeed a highly advanced concept, modern logic, however, lacks some characteristic philosophical features – it is more straightforward and technical. Modern logic is often called mathematical logic, thereby emphasizing the originality of its new methods compared to those used previously. In this sense, it is of less interest for discussion because it relies on exact sciences and computer technologists and avoids ambiguity. Thus, modern logic is built on artificial language and intelligence, which in itself is rather boring compared to traditional concepts.",
    "Using innovative technologies, ADNOC is planning to apply its electronic developments in all spheres of activity and production as early as next year. An equally noteworthy example of the diversity and multifunctionality of the use of artificial intelligence is the predictive ability of computer programs. The company is developing a computer capable of processing an impressive amount of large data and suggesting strategies for the company’s actions depending on the forecast. The developers of software for ADNOC strive to build a machine that would work according to a certain theory but would be able to offer the possibility of effective data reading. That is why, within the framework of the company, a powerful program was developed not only for material processing but also for its visualization. By using more accessible visual media to convey complex information, the development makes the future and present of the company more clearly visible and intelligible. The use of computer technologies in the development of a large company is noticeable at all levels of its existence. ADNOC uses computer simulations to improve the operation of the network chain and visualize data for a clearer picture of the company’s position. All these developments are implemented in each of the branches of the company’s operation, increasing the speed of performance and the effectiveness of actions that are more beneficial. Their project to computerize and update all sorts of areas of the company’s activities should be fully implemented in 2022 (ADNOC, 2020). This underlines the firm’s commitment to anticipating and adapting to the future. The company strives to develop a forecasting model that would include the largest possible amount of statistical data. The results of big data processing show that ADNOC has significantly accelerated the speed and the number of financial transactions through its software. Based on the logic of increasing the turnover of money, one can conclude that this software improves the financial performance of the company. In addition, it should be noted that as part of the accelerated exchange of money, an innovative blockchain technology is used, which provides a permanent digital transfer of currency. The program’s ability to make smart business decisions is already reflected in its $ 1 billion worth of stocks (Arabian Business, 2020). The varied opportunities for financial enrichment brought by this program are potentially enormous.",
    "The adversarial criminal justice system is one where the law is applied equally to all segments of the society. It is a system that presumes that one is innocent that shifts the burden of proof to the prosecution to prove beyond any shadow of a doubt. The advantage lies on the side of the defendant if there is any doubt. The accused is granted the right to silence and cannot be forced to respond to accusation levelled against them. This system poses some ethical problems because most of its procedural safeguards are always in favour of the accused. The favours that are granted to the accused include the right of appeal, the right to remain silent, the right to have an attorney, and the right to be free from unauthorized searches and arrests. The rights granted to the defendant are always a disadvantage to the prosecution which has to prove its case against the accused. This position is biased against the prosecution and makes its work even more difficult. The system encourages a scenario where both entities to a case contest with each other to win a case. This scenario makes it easier vulnerable to acts of deception and legal tactics that are questionable instead of using facts to settle cases. It is a potential ethical problem that can be solved by allowing both parties to present facts before any judgment is made to avoid injustices. If a black man is found committing a similar offence like a white woman, he is five times more likely to be arrested. It is a tendency that has been brought about by racism in the American judicial system and racial inequality in policing. Moreover, the black man is more likely to be convicted than a white woman who has committed a similar crime. According to a report by the United States Sentencing Commission, a black man who is found the same crime as the white man have a potential of receiving nearly 20% longer prison term (Ingraham, 2017). These disparities are due to cases of racism and bias found within the American criminal justice system.",
    "When learning about religions and philosophies, I find that origins or backgrounds are essential in interpreting the context and content of a religion. For Jainism, it was vital to learn that it is substantially older than a more well-known and contemporary Sikhism. Though both have close ties with Hinduism, Sihkism’s origins date back to only about 500 years ago while Jainism has a history of nearly 2500 years (Molloy 191). Sikhism exhibits a more militaristic approach to monotheism despite being more modern. As such, the Jainist belief that no Creator exists and that the universe is simply guided by natural forces becomes especially interesting as it rejects a very traditional integration of deities into theology. Following this, it is also interesting to me to observe in what ways a religion interacts with the world through its perspective. As mentioned above, Jainism rejects the belief in a Creator or God. This belief is held up by several philosophical questions that are even asked in atheistic circles. These include contradictions in typical monotheistic religions such as God being both perfect and creating an imperfect world or God loving all life but still allowing suffering. Jainism even poses a logical fallacy, which suggests that if everything in the universe had to be created, would God not also need to be created? This worldview is surprisingly modern and potentially controversial for its time. Ethics is another vital component of any philosophy or belief system. Jainism establishes five distinct principles of ethics which are Ahimsa (non-violence), Satya (truth), Astheya (non-stealing), Brahmacharya (chastity), and Aparigraha (non-possession). I am especially interested in Ahimsa which is the core of Jainist ethics. This is because I believe that many religions excuse violence due to their beliefs, which is inherently immoral to my values. Jainism proposes that non-violence is a priority and therefore inexcusable.",
    "It is important to note that it is highly common for one culture not to be able to understand the state, internal struggles, and intricacies of a different culture. The given notion is called ethnocentrism, where one’s perspective and views are centered around his or her own culture. For example, the book states: “people in America don’t understand, but when an American chain opens in a third-world country, people go crazy” (Noah 188). As a person living in Canada, I embody Canadian culture, where most people from developing nations might not fully understand that a mere fast food restaurant chain is not such a thrilling occurrence for regular consumers. The book also states that “Westerners are shocked and confused by that, but it’s a case of the West reaping what it has sown. The colonial powers carved Africa, put the black man to work, and did not properly educate him” (Noah 194). Similarly, many assume that Canadian people are excessively polite as part of the culture, but I would want others to know that it is not the case. One of the most interesting aspects of the book is how certain tyrants are not perceived as such in other places due to the lack of their relevance, which is why it is true for current leaders in Canada as well. The text states: “so in Europe and America, yes, Hitler is the Greatest Madman in History, In Africa, he’s just another strongman from history books” (Noah 196). Although Canada did not have such tyrants, many people outside Canada perceive that our leaders are perfect and representative of true democracy. However, it is not always true because they also face challenges for power struggles and do not always behave in the nation’s best interests, which are becoming more evident in recent events.",
    "Globalization is the extent to which information, investments, trade, political cooperation, cultural values, and social ideas flow among different countries. It is creating a borderless world for managers by allowing them to conduct their operations internationally rather than locally, hire employees from different countries, buy raw materials from the best sources, and sell goods in various markets (Samson et al., 2020). Although the borderless world presents many opportunities to managers, it also entails risks, such as information security and cultural differences. A global mindset is a manager’s ability to recognize and influence people or organizations that have different cultural, social, political, and psychological backgrounds (Samson et al., 2020). It has become imperative for international companies because managers constantly interact with individuals with different perspectives. To ensure effective operations and collaboration, managers should be able to understand these perspectives instead of sticking to a worldview prevalent in their home country. The international landscape is changing since China, India, and Brazil demonstrate economic growth and play an important role in global business. For example, China has received more foreign investments than any other place and has increased its number of Fortune Global 500 companies from 16 in 2005 to 98 in 2015 (Samson et al., 2020). While China is growing through manufacturing, India develops economically through services, software design, and precision engineering. A multinational corporation (MNC) is a company, with more than 25% of revenues which come from operations in countries other than the home country of the parent organization (Samson et al., 2020). MNCs are characterized by close cooperation among affiliates in different countries and a single management authority making key decisions for the parent company and all affiliates (Samson et al., 2020). Additionally, MNC managers have a global perspective, viewing the whole world as one market. Outsourcing refers to participating in a global division of labor that enables companies to complete certain activities in locations with the cheapest raw materials and labor (Samson et al., 2020). Exporting is an entry strategy in which the company’s production facilities remain in the home country, while produced goods are transferred to other countries for sale. Licensing is an entry strategy in which the company in one country gives firms in other countries access to specific resources, such as technology or trademark rights, to produce and sell its products abroad (Samson et al., 2020). Direct investing is an entry strategy where the company manages its production facilities in another country.",
    "This study’s independent variable was a helpful message on the back of the dining check regarding the upcoming specials. The dependent variable was the percentage of the bill left as a tip to the waiter. This study operationalizes the restaurant tipping culture by focusing on the tip percentage. The potential confounding variables of this experiment may be the food quality, the server’s gender, the dining party’s size, and whether the customers were regulars. The study’s strengths include design transparency, implementation simplicity, and potential replication in different settings. However, the message’s content varied depending on the special, appealing differently to customers. Furthermore, the study was conducted only in one restaurant, which renders extrapolation to different establishment classes difficult. These factors could impact the tipping outcomes and, therefore, the study results. Furthermore, it is unclear whether the mere presence of a personalized message or the message content itself drove the outcome. To evaluate this possibility, the authors could have asked waiters to write different messages, some with no useful content, such as wishing a good day or drawing a smiley face. Moreover, the researchers could have used alternative arrangements, assigning the waiters randomly instead of assigning dining parties randomly. Several aspects of this study could impact its internal validity. The researchers have instructed servers to keep their behavior consistent, thus limiting potential confounding variables. Varying attitudes may affect the final tip, thus undermining the causal relationship. Furthermore, a few hypothetical aspects could limit the research’s external validity. For instance, if the waiter were a young female adult, applying the same conclusions to male waiters and older servers would be challenging, given the potential gender factor. If the study was conducted at a private country club, extrapolating the result onto the high-class restaurant and casual diners alike would be unreliable. If the meal was buffet-style, the overall tipping percentage might have been lower due to the perceived lesser effort of a waiter, thus impacting its wider applicability. Lastly, the study only used two groups, servers, and dining parties, with no size specification. The authors could have employed a third group of solo dining parties, thus separating groups from those dining by themselves. Such an addition would allow addressing the question of the groups’ size effect and individual, interpersonal interactions. Lastly, implementing the design with solo dining parties would address the effect of gender on the outcome.",
    "As apparent from the title, the focus of the article “Positive leadership psychology: Authentic and servant leadership in higher education in Pakistan” is the Pakistani educational system, whose organization the authors analyze through the lens of leadership. Specifically, they examine the role of centralized guidance in the learning process and speculate on which style can influence its participants in the most favorable ways. In particular, the piece highlights the importance of relationships of trust in education. According to the authors, any suppressive hierarchy, strict subordination, or an atmosphere of complete obedience prevents people from openness, becoming a serious obstacle to social exchange. The latter is seen as the foundation of productive teamwork and presupposes an awareness of the other’s feelings as well as motives for searching for the most appropriate behavioral patterns. Therefore, within Bloom’s taxonomy, more precisely, its cognitive domain, the article describes the knowledge, the primary level. The publication is quite coherent and well-structured, which marks its appropriate quality. Notably, the outcomes of the analysis appear in an understandable form and actually serve to illustrate the theoretical background, in which part the authors comment on the essentiality of proper leadership in organizations. The practical part involves a detailed examination of several types and styles, specifically, the ways various leaders interact with employees. The general conclusion is the criticality of mutual respect and dedication to recognizing everybody’s needs, which underlies servant leadership as a practice. Human resources and psychology of leadership apparently are the areas where the investigators specialize. Notably, they participated in a range of publications on several topics within the above fields, such as organizational leadership, individual leadership, culture-specific peculiarities, and others. As mentioned, Current Psychology, the global peer-reviewed research forum, accepted their work for publishing, which means that it meets its quite specific quality requirements. It was found through the JFL, Jerry Falwell Library.",
    "Various cultures around the world have unique creation myths and traditional methods of presenting them through art. The cosmology of the Aztec civilization was quite different from the Europeans that conquered them. Firstly, the Europeans’ Christian God “created mankind in his own image” and granted him dominion over a perfectly constructed world, the Garden of Eden (Holy Bible, New International Version, Genesis 1:27). In the Bible, he is described as a benevolent, if strict, father figure who can forgive humankind their sins and grant them eternal redemption. Consequently, God is depicted in art as a wise, older man with a beard and white hair. Christian art primarily praises the power of His forgiveness and the bountiful nature that He created. In contrast, Aztec creation stories are based on dismembered gods, and thus the origin of the world is catastrophic violence, which explains why Aztec art depicts divinity as gruesome and awe-inspiring (National University, 2022). Their art functions as a warning and an order to obey. They demand blood in exchange for food, and each sculpture of the gods in Aztec culture contains a receptacle for human hearts (National University, 2022). Unlike Christianity, the central figure is a female goddess, but similarly to Eve, she is primarily a passive player whom the other gods punish. Furthermore, Coatlique’s choice to give birth a second time against her children’s wishes could also be interpreted as the Aztec version of Eve’s sin of disobedience. Both Aztec and Christian gods are described as perfect and self-contained. However, in the Aztec mythos, gods are above the concepts of good and evil, while in the Christian order evil is considered the dominion of Satan and the opposite of God. Therefore, Aztecs have to appease a bloodthirsty, violent goddess to receive food and survive. On the other hand, Christians have to reject sin and submit their spirit to God to gain eternal salvation. Ultimately, the Christian creation story is based on forgiveness and love compared to the Aztecs’ survival through violence, and this difference is reflected in their opposing art styles.",
    "The concept of nursing is closely associated with the idea of continuous improvement, as the trends of health care need to mirror the existing social trends to provide the best care possible. One way to secure such care is to refer to the latest scholarly findings to modify the approaches to care provision in the workplace. This process of implementing research-based findings in daily patient care is known as evidence-based practice (EBP) (Wilson & Austria, 2021). Currently, EBP is not used actively by nurses for several reasons. First, the workload of most nurses discourages their desire to learn and embrace EBP. According to McArthur et al. (2021), a physical opportunity is a construct that contributes to the nurses’ ability to resort to EBM. Physical opportunity includes such barriers as “cost and lack of resources, compromised communication, staff turnover, and limited physical guidelines” (McArthur et al., 2021, p. 20). As a result, management promotes behavioral patterns that react to the environment rather than examine it in advance. The second massive barrier to EBP in the workplace is the lack of social opportunity embodied in the lack of organizational support and teamwork (McArthur et al., 2021). Since the aforementioned examples tackle only a minor part of the existing challenged, the need to intervene and facilitate EBP is evident. The first commonly mentioned approach to facilitate the use of EBP is to establish a leadership that would encourage the practice by both setting an example and conducting training and workshops. Another crucial facilitator is to secure nurses’ access to relevant sources in the workplace, including relevant databases, steady Internet connection, and subscription to peer-reviewed publications. In such a way, the use of scholarly research will become more time-efficient and less stressful for nurses.",
    "It goes without saying that Beowulf may be regarded as one of the most prominent ancient European poems. Although its origin remains the subject of multiple discussions, the common version describes it as “a Danish poem in the Anglo-Saxon dialect” (Neidorf 847). The poem describes the glorious life and deeds of a hero, Beowulf, who was regarded as a person sent by heaven for people (Gummere line 13). Helping Hrothgar, king of the Danes, he kills the monster Grendel and his mother. Later, when he becomes the king of Danes by himself, he has to fight a dragon that terrorizes his lands. Although he follows the beast and finally slays it, Beowulf dies, being mortally wounded. From a personal perspective, this poem reflects several essential aspects of human life. The first one is the issue of identity – in Beowulf , people were entirely associated with the glory of their ancestors. They do not exist independently from their family lineage and kinship bonds. Thus, their desire of Beowulf to be recognizable and honored forces him to search for deeds and fame. Thus, another important theme of the poem is the maturity and responsibility that come with age. At the beginning of the poem, the main hero desires personal glory and has nothing to lose. However, after becoming a king, he realizes the importance of being a wise ruler who is responsible for his people’s lives. Finally, one more topic of the poem is the tension between personal value systems and the heroic code and between Christian and pagan values. It may be regarded as an example of the multifacetedness and complexity of human nature in comparison with fixed rules that frequently do not provide appropriate answers.",
    "Beowulf is an Anglo-Saxon epic poem set in Jutland before the Angles migrated to Britain. The title of this literary work is the name of the main character (Hall 2). Beowulf became one of the revered heroes in Old English literature, and the poem itself had a strong influence on pop culture. This epic character, who accepts his fate without hesitation, attracts attention in modern times full of doubts and contradictions with his almost archetypal clarity and wholeness. Indeed, for example, it can be assumed that modern superhero comics are particularly popular, partly because people still need the image of a fair, superpowered being. One of the most popular heroes of the Marvel Universe is Superman. Their similarities with Beowulf are obvious – both have incredible strength and are role models for the people of their time (Burn 107). These heroes have to overcome obstacles to help those who need support. In both universes, strength and extreme physical abilities become objects of praise and reverence. In addition, a key factor contributing to the plot of the heroes’ destinies is the presence of an enemy, on whose destruction depends the survival of the world. However, the fundamental difference is that a hero’s physical strength is not enough to admire him for modern people. This characteristic must be complemented by the purity of thought and good intentions. The hero becomes much more complex as the modern world gets more sophisticated. The fact that people still draw inspiration from old stories correlates with the tenets of postmodernist theory. According to the latter, it is necessary to constantly reproduce what has passed, make sense of it, and experiment with its content. It can be seen that stories about legendary superheroes remain relevant to contemporary viewers, readers, and audiences in general. As in Saxon times, bravery and loyalty are revered, and having these characteristics is what makes an individual a role model.",
    "There are multiple factors that stand behind the successful implementation of the P-O-L-C framework. It is important to prioritize some of them duly in case a company faces serious issues, or when the market indicates upcoming challenges. The collapse of WorldCom in 2002, that led to one of the largest accounting scandals in the US, provides a nice example of the lack of proper communication in a corporation. The inability of various top managers and accountants to communicate efficiently in order to prevent frauds is always disastrous. WorldCom grew rapidly under Bernard Ebbers who managed to jump at the multiple opportunities that the growing interest for telecom services provided at that time. Nevertheless, the company went bankrupt in a matter of a few years. Moreover, Ebbers faced several charges, including one count of conspiracy, one count of securities fraud and seven counts of filing false statements with securities regulators. The fact that the large portion of Ebber’s wealth was in WorldCom stocks, let alone several loans and loan guarantees from the company, was also scrutinized. The top managers of the company faced numerous charges and started to testify against each other. Moreover, Ebbers and his subordinates alike claimed to know nothing of the fraudulent schemes. According to Knecht (2020), up to 80% of employees generally believe that their opinions are not taken into account. Therefore, the major factor that led to the collapse of the telecom giant was the diminished quality of communication within the company. The reasons for all the misunderstanding and complicated series of negotiations between Ebbers, directors and accountants are rooted in barriers to communication that include motive distortion and extreme self-absorption. The top managers and professionals who were expected to lead the company tended to prioritize their own interests and receive only the parts of information and data that was convenient to them. Thus, the atmosphere created by such an attitude eventually led to the collapse of the corporation, as a result of the lack of decently organized teamwork.",
    "The Bhagavad Gita is an ancient Indian scripture that consists of 700 verses and is part of the larger epic Mahabharata. This book is one of the central holy scriptures of Hinduism and dates from the second half of the first millennium BC. e. The plot of the Gita unfolds within the framework of a conversation between Arjuna, the prince of the Pandavas, and Krishna, his guide, charioteer, and the supreme God incarnate. Krishna prompts Arjuna’s behavior patterns and helps to solve some moral expectations. The latter is connected with the need for the Pandavas to fight against the Kauravas. This paper aims to reflect on the Bhagavad Gita , one of the most outstanding books of the Indian epic. Arjuna exhibits characteristic traits, such as self-confidence, arrogance, pride. Arjuna demonstrates outstanding martial skills and is one of the best warriors. Krishna is the personification of the Supreme God and his traits include wisdom, humility, knowledge, and benevolence. The two characters have a close relationship: “Then, Madhava (Krishna) and the son of Pandu (Arjuna), stationed in their magnificent chariot with white horses yoked to it, loudly blew their divine conchs” (“Bhagavad Gita,” 2021, p. 13). Other characters are the Kaurava king Dhritarashtra and his adviser Sanjaya, secondary characters. The purpose of the author of the epic was to tell about the battle of Kurukshetra, where two Indian armies gathered to fight until the final victory. Arjuna asks Krishna to drive up to the center of the battlefield and finds those who will participate and those who want war – his relatives, friends, and teachers. Arjuna feels betrayed as he doesn’t want to fight and kill them. Full of doubt, he drops his bow and asks his charioteer Krishna many questions about the reasons for the war, the possibility of renouncing the battle, the correctness of his action, and ethical dilemmas. Thus, the reflection on the Bhagavad Gita, one of the most outstanding books of the Indian epic, was provided. The book is relevant, as it reveals eternal themes – morality, justice, a sense of duty, a feeling of love for one’s neighbor. The philosophical dialogue between Arjuna and Krishna touches on the most challenging ethical topics that apply to both war and peace. The characters discuss identity crisis, the purpose of life, the human self, and human temperament.",
    "The TED Talks are illustrations of bio-psycho-social-spiritual developmental issues which ultimately create circumstances in which certain people do not feel fully included in society. For example, Smith (2015) refers to the differences correlating with raising a white and a black child. Abdel-Magied (2014), on the other hand, exemplifies how a piece of clothing changes the way people treat, view, and evaluate Muslim women. It is certain that discrimination starts with bias, which is a layered concept. An article published by New York Times (2016) refers to the experiences of non-white people in the US, which often correlate with the lack of feeling of inclusion. This is also perpetrated by bias, which creates specific overviews in which people tend to favor a group of people over another one. The bias may be automatic, ambiguous, and ambivalent depending on its characteristics and how it manifests in terms of people’s opinions on certain groups of individuals (Fiske, 2022). While such incidents have never been personally experienced, it is certain that the lives of people I know have been affected in terms of self-esteem and confidence, which can often be negatively impacted because of discrimination. I would like to explore racial bias due to its relevance in today’s day and age, namely how it manifests on structural levels.",
    "The film “Coded Bias” provides comprehensive information regarding the problems related to facial recognition algorithms, determining several sources of bias. They primarily include the original orientation of creators on white faces, leading to the lack of data regarding dark complexion and the prevalence of prejudiced male developers. These conditions do not allow establishing equality in terms of race and gender and seem to present a significant threat to the field stemming from the failure to meet everyone’s needs. In addition, the lack of knowledge of how the programs process data and make conclusions does not help eliminate the risks. In turn, the possible ways of reducing this type of bias attributed to present-day facial recognition algorithms are to prevent their implementation in legal proceedings and police activity in general and introduce practical improvements. The former means accepting responsibility for decisions, and the latter suggestion is multi-faceted and should begin with updating databases to increase their variety and conducting independent assessments to confirm efficiency. By adopting these measures, bias based on race and gender can be addressed over time, and the appropriate quality of operations can be guaranteed. The mentioned ideas seem crucial for promoting proper use of technology; however, they can not only increase the precision of programs but also resolve the challenge concerning surveillance and racialized minorities. This standpoint is based on the above consideration, according to which accountability for decisions should be clearly established. This change can be performed if the algorithms work correctly, and minimizing or eliminating bias, in this case, is possible if internal and external evaluations correlate with each other. In this way, the future of this field in terms of its suitability for investigations is conditional upon the efforts of specialists in resolving the existing issues to address major concerns of Nakamura and Browne.",
    "The Caribbean history includes the ruthless colonization by Western countries like Spain. Upon colonization, the area was home to native groups such as the Ciboney or Guanahuatebey, Taino Arawak, and Carib. The colonizers brought a bunch of enslaved Africans who would work in their homes and plantations. The Whites were the minority and foreigners in the Caribbean but brutally seized and ruled against the Blacks majority. However, the Blacks maintained their identity and self-expression through various cultural activities evident to date. The Caribbean is the home for many musical genres expressing human freedom and revolution. Reggae is associated with the Caribbean people, and it is the unofficial soundtrack of many Caribbean vacations. Reggae musicians such as Bob Marley and the Wailers produced revolutionary and redemptions songs protesting against the White brutal rule in the Caribbean. Therefore, through Reggae, the Caribbean people expressed their anger against the ruthless White control. The majority African population in the Caribbean identified themselves with their cuisines and customs, including religious beliefs. The enslaved people maintained their African culinary art and cherished their cuisines. For instance, the Callaloo, the Caribbean vegetable soup, is one of the national dishes in Tobago and Trinidad. Furthermore, carnivores and parades are serious business in the area. The Caribbean parades manifest the area’s folklores and customs of African origin. The Caribbean people commemorate events in history like slavery through carnivals. The distinct African heritage in the Caribbean helped in identifying the Blacks. The Caribbean was colonized by the whites, who were the minority of the area’s population. The colonizers brought Africans who worked in their homes and plantations under the fierce rule. However, the enslaved people and the Blacks in the area expressed and identified themselves through music and distinct African heritage. Reggae songs helped the Blacks protest against the pitiless white rule, and events such as the parades and carnivals commemorated slavery. Furthermore, African cuisines such as Callaloo identified Africanism in the Caribbean. Despite the brutal rule by the White minority, the Blacks in the Caribbean expressed and identified themselves through songs and events that are evident to date.",
    "Society has always been a fundamental institution influencing the development of states. Communicating in groups, people share values, views, and responses to a particular phenomenon. Interaction in communities or clubs cultivates a public attitude to multiple events, forms a lifestyle, and influences politics. For this reason, the changes in civic life are significant for states. Putnam, in his essay “Bowling Alone,” also emphasizes this idea, saying that the social life of the USA collapses, and it is difficult to predict the results of this process. Active engagement in social processes has always been one of the major features peculiar to the country, but the situation has changed. Putnam says that “tens of millions of Americans had forsaken their parents’ habitual readiness to engage in the simplest act of citizenship” (67). It means that people have started to alter their lifestyles, shifting towards isolation and detachment, which is not typical for U.S. society. Furthermore, traditional organizations, such as clubs, are replaced by new mass membership organizations. Putnam says they have more political importance and might impact the country; however, they do not promote civic engagement. “For the vast majority of their members, the only act of membership consists in writing a check for dues or perhaps occasionally reading a newsletter” (Putnam 70). This line shows that Putnam is worried about the continuous process of disconnecting community members, who become divided and disengaged. From a long-term perspective, it might result in the collapse of civic life. The results cannot be predicted as the USA has always been a state with strong community relations. That is why Putnam says that if nothing changes, we will bowl alone, isolated from others.",
    "One of the most critical factors of breast cancer development is heredity since it causes a genetically inherent disease. If the patient’s closest relatives have been diagnosed with breast cancer, a tumor’s likelihood is high even at a young age (Coleman & Tsongalis, 2016). Since one of the patient’s close relatives had this disease, this diagnosis is indeed possible for her as well. Another significant factor in developing cancer is various diseases of the mammary glands, for example, “cystic” breasts. In the presence of such conditions, the formation of atypical cells is possible in the mammary gland (Tkaczuk et al., 2016). This can lead to their overgrowth and increase the risk of more severe diseases. The hormonal factor also has a critical influence on health. In the described case, this aspect is the most significant since it includes various details of the patient’s life. These include the first pregnancy after 30 years, not breastfeeding, and many years of taking hormonal contraceptives. This leads to the fact that the patient’s hormonal background can be disrupted (Tkaczuk et al., 2016). Therefore, with age, it becomes more difficult for the body to deal with abnormal processes. If there is an initial stage of cancer, there can be no metastasis in the patient’s organs. However, early active metastasis is characteristic of aggressive forms of cancer. There are multiple ways to determine them, and it is necessary to use some of them in any case to avoid future health problems. Histological analysis of tissue can determine the aggressiveness of the cancer type at an early stage. Breast cancer metastases detected by CT or scintigraphy indicate secondary foci in the lungs, liver, bones, and brain. It must be remembered that in breast cancer, metastases are capable of long-term existence in a latent state, even five to ten years after removal of the primary tumor.",
    "International labor laws prohibit making employment decisions regarding individuals’ age and disabilities. It means that Etihad Airways infringed on the existing regulations by introducing its approach to layoff. Considering the fact that social justice is a central demand for multinational corporations, Etihad’s conduct can be viewed as unethical and irrelevant. The more significant employee involvement in the decision-making process could have helped to avoid this situation. It directly influences performance and guarantees that fair decisions considering the workers’ input are made. Thus, Etihad attained success in compensating employees for their contribution and work. Payment processing is a critical factor influencing job security and employees’ motivation, meaning that this decision helps Etihad to generate benefits and rehire them in the future. From the case, one can also see that reduction in job security was a critical factor associated with the change process in Etihad. The decision to fire workers resulted in a lack of confidence among specialists and reduced their motivation and long-term plans in the corporation. For this reason, it is critical to secure employee positions to ensure individuals are engaged and fulfill their duties effectively. Discrimination was another factor peculiar to the change process at Etihad Airways. The corporation disregarded the corporate social responsibility issues, which resulted in the growth of dissatisfaction, lack of motivation, and engagement. It means that the company ignored possible alternatives that could have been used instead of its discriminative practices undermining job security and individuals’ readiness to work with such entities. Altogether, the case shows that lack of employee involvement was one of the fundamental issues in the case. The company’s top management made changes with minimal employee involvement. It resulted in creating an unpopular and ineffective strategy that cultivated dissatisfaction among workers. Etihad Airways ignored employees’ need for self-actualization, decreasing their motivation. The remaining workers did not feel their importance to the corporation and the power to influence its development. It demonstrates that modern workers should be provided with the chance to participate in corporate decision-making to realize their significance and become motivated. Trying to manage the wage bill, Etihad Airways accepted the wrong decision, viewing layoff as the only possible option. The choice of disability and age as criteria for decision-making infringed on the existing labor laws. Moreover, it undermined job security as employees realized their vulnerable position. Outcomes prove the low effectiveness of this strategy. Regarding the absence of available manpower, the remaining employees started to suffer from burnout because of the high level of stress. Moreover, the lack of motivation and engagement because of the processes mentioned above influenced their performance. As a result, Etihad Airways’ ability to achieve existing objectives was hindered. The case proves the critical importance of employee involvement in decision-making during the change process as it helps to motivate them and select the most acceptable options.",
    "Every business must be managed carefully, and every detail must receive a fair amount of attention. When it comes to healthcare, such facilities must require even more attention because they focus on people’s well-being. Performing such duties might be strenuous and expensive, and mentally demanding. As a Chief Nursing Officer, one will be faced with principles that include integrity maintenance, cash flow management, and employee motivation in the given circumstances. To start with, a healthcare business must always maintain its integrity. It can be evident that any business field should be focused on communication, which makes integrity a vital part (Fisher, 2008). In the given facility, the integrity maintenance principle is heavily adhered to. First of all, every doctor follows an ethical code, meaning that they know of doctor-patient confidentiality. Moreover, doctors and nurses focus on honest communication with patients. For example, in my situation, I tell patients about their actual conditions and honestly answer their questions. Another important business principle is proper cash flow management. Healthcare facility requires renovations and innovations, meaning that there will constantly be situations when new equipment or repairs will be needed (Mason et al., 2020). In this situation, it is highly necessary to implement the needed changes to not jeopardize patients’ health and well-being. For example, as a CNO, it was my obligation to manage the replacement of power generators. As a result, generators enabled the personnel to carry out their duty without problems during a storm and power outage. The last principle is the management of employees and providing them with motivation. In the case of a healthcare facility, it is essential that the employees are rewarded and their hard work is appreciated. The employees are offered extra days off and gift cards in the given facility. This can make the workers feel heard and supported. Without these steps, the nurses and doctors will have burnout and lose the desire to provide high-quality results. Thus, the given principles were chosen due to the impact they can bring on employees and patients. The mentioned principles are being used, providing good results and leading to the satisfaction of all parties. These principles are important to me since I believe that healthcare should be based on these values. Otherwise, no facility will be able to treat their patients, and there will be no trust and respect between healthcare personnel and patients.",
    "The nature of mythology and its persistence in culture throughout thousands of years has long fascinated scholars and thinkers. Joseph Campbell’s book entitled The hero with a thousand faces investigates this issue in detail to reveal how myth as a psychologically informed phenomenon predetermines cultural patterns of humanity. In this paper, the first chapter of the book, “Myth and dream,” will be at the center of the discussion. The thesis of this part might be projected through the following quote. The author states that myths “are dangerous because they threaten the fabric of the security into which we have built ourselves and our family. But they are fiendishly fascinating too, for they carry keys that open the whole realm of the desired and feared adventure of the discovery of the self” (Campbell, 2004, p. 7). Such a formulation implies that people’s minds intertwine myths and dreams as a mechanism of self-perception, understanding of the self in the context of the whole life cycle, and coping with developmental change. Myths lead people through the challenges of life and allow for integrating the conscious and subconscious into a single framework. Indeed, prior to presenting the idea in the above-mentioned quote, Campbell (2004) refers to the repetitive occurrence of the terrors and irrationalities from ancient mythology in contemporary people’s dreams. Indeed, the motifs of hatred, vanity, jealousy are intertwined with love, gratitude, and other feelings and motivations to action. In such a manner, these matters are dangerous to people because they unveil the psychological underpinnings of their subconscious in ways that contradict their rational or conscious decision-making and thinking. The author elaborates on this central idea by referring to the letters written by people about their myth-like dreams reflecting their concerns or subconscious struggles. Campbell (2004) presents an example of a young man’s dream about accidentally killing his father to obtain the full attention of his mother, which has been a recurring theme in mythology. Furthermore, the author refers to a dream of a woman who sees a half-horse-half-man individual in her dream despite any ideas of infidelity experienced consciously. In this regard, the connection between the experiences of early childhood and adulthood is essential for myths and their manifestation in dreams. This observation helps explain the second part of the quote, which states that through the contradictions of the myth-like dreams, people can understand their selves and the subconscious triggers of their emotions and behaviors.",
    "Recent fad diets have suggested that carbohydrates cause harm to one’s body. However, this statement has been refuted many times for several reasons. Firstly, to get a beautiful, efficiently functioning body, one needs nutrients – fats, proteins, carbohydrates, and water (Nazario). Carbohydrate metabolism converts carbs into vital energy for the nervous system and brain, as well as for the possibility of proper metabolism of proteins and fats. Once these elements are eliminated, there is a high risk of developing continuous fatigue, which potentially leads to depressive mood. Secondly, giving up carbohydrates leads to extra pounds because after completing a carb-free diet, the body is susceptible to every gram of carbohydrates, and super-compensation occurs in the diet. In addition to an increased appetite for carbohydrate-containing foods, the assimilation of this element increases significantly (Nazario). For example, a person was on such a diet for a month and lost ten pounds, and then immediately returned to a regular diet, regaining the same weight within a week. Thirdly, even after the first day of giving up carbohydrates, a person may feel a slight malaise and headache (Nazario). Later, there is a chance of developing constant headaches leading to migraine. Ultimately, carbohydrates are the primary source of energy for the brain. All cognitive functions slowly fade away when the main “engine” ceases to receive sufficient charge. Almost every activity demands increased brain activity which is stimulated by carbs (Nazario). When a person does not consume them, primarily the level of concentration reduces. Constant burning of ketones instead of glucose can lead to impaired brain function. Therefore, it is vital to include carbs into one’s ration in order to ensure that all bodily systems function properly.",
    "Cost of Advanced Documentation System The Advanced Documentation System is a document technology partner that helps optimize and ameliorate the work of the company’s printers. The costs spent on printers and their supply grow exponentially within years. There are various ways to improve the way printers are handled by implementing helpful services such as the Advanced Documentation System. The cost of the system depends on the brand, for instance on Capterra, the service costs $25 per month with a minimum of 5 working places which is $125 in total (Capterra, 2022). The software has a free trial period that allows the customer to understand the features of the system and its working specialties. The usage of the system can become profitable for the company within time. It is a cost-saving service as it analyzes and teaches the personnel to use various printer regimes for various needs. The software teaches the customer to use the printer on a higher level and consequently leads to better document management including converting papers to digital and re-engineering procedures for better productivity. The service successfully integrates into the IT environment of the firm and optimizes the inner work processes. Eventually, the implementation of the Advanced Documentation System can become an investment within time as it can save the time of the personnel, increase their productivity, and help the environment (Advanced Document Systems, 2022). The environmental-friendly approach is based on saving the print and the time printers are used by the personnel. Alternative Funding Sources The company can pay for the service using various financial resources for alternative funding resources. The sources usually depend on the scale of the firm, its level of income, and its current position in the market. The easiest and most accessible way to pay for Advanced Document System is from the cash flow, especially if the company has a surplus of profit. Some companies do not possess many employees and income, and they can take a bank loan to cover the costs of the system. The bank loan can also be helpful when the service is needed for many seats that have to be united and optimized. Then, the costs spent on the system increase, and extra funding might be needed. To increase the cash flow, the company can also go to the equity market and issue the stocks. The more stocks are sold to shareholders, the more cash flow the firm receives and can use for different needs. The other way to find alternative funding sources is to issue bonds that represent a fixed-income instrument. A bond is a debt obligation meaning that the company loans from an investor a specific sum of money. Bonds are safe for investors and faster to get for the company because more people invest in bonds as a safer method. Finally, the company can use mixed funding to get the cash for the payment which means uniting several methods described above. All the funding opportunities are possible for buying and implementing the Advanced Documentation System.",
    "Rolling Stones were in the shadow of the Beatles from the very beginning, and this fact disturbed them a lot. On the other hand, most of the fame went to the Beatles, and the Rolling Stones constantly felt their superiority. To be different, they tried to become the anti-Beatles. The legendary Beatles were a pioneer of hard rock: the musical influence of the song Helter Skelter led to the emergence of heavy metal (Covach and Bell 28). The influence of The Rolling Stones on the formation and development of rock music cannot be overestimated. It was significant not only in music, like the Beatles but also in artistic and visual, image and mass media terms. In songwriting development, the Rolling Stones tried hard to keep up with their competitors, but it was not easy, and they seemed to be one step behind. A lot of what they did was a reaction to what the Beatles had already done. For example, when a sitar began to sound in the Beatles’ composition, it immediately appeared in the Rolling Stones. The Beatles, with their working-class origins in provincial Liverpool, sought to maintain an elegant image (Covach and Bell 28). They dressed in decent suits, cut their hair neatly and short, and communicated politely with everyone. The Rolling Stones did the opposite: they wore black leather clothes and looked and behaved provocatively. In 1964, when The Beatles first came to the US, it was called the British invasion (Covach and Bell 28). The Beatles took all five first places in the Billboard singles chart at once and became the only ones who were able to set such a record (Covach and Bell 28). The Rolling Stones also achieved success in the US, mainly through shocking exposure, but they did not shake the Beatles’ position. Many of the rock bands of the 60s, The Beatles and The Rolling Stones, are seen as irreconcilable rivals. The reasons to think so are quite weighty: they played different music and had different images. However, both groups have influenced music around the world and have become one of the most recognizable – this is their main similarity.",
    "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic and long-term disorder characterized by uncontrollable, repeated thoughts and behaviors that an individual feels the need to repeat over and over. The case of Robert, a twenty-three-year-old young man, will be discussed further. Robert came to a mental health facility to get treated for anxiety, but it soon turned out that he rather struggled with OCD because he strongly smelled of disinfectant and reported excessive cleaning behaviors. After being in contact with surfaces and people, Robert felt a strong urge to wash his hands with bleach. He could wash his hands up to thirty times a day, which damaged his skin dramatically. However, the fear of germs was much stronger, and he could not stand touching something without washing his hands afterward. The issue of cleanliness took a great toll on his mental health. During the pandemic, the symptoms of OCD increased significantly. Robert reported wearing a HAZMAT suit outside, afraid of contracting the virus. In his social life, Robert avoids making physical contact with people and prefers keeping his distance from them. He works remotely from home, which quite pleases him because he does not have to go anywhere and spend time with other people in a confined space. Overall, Robert does not have a dependency on other people when it comes to handling his OCD and prefers being on his own the majority of the time. In Robert’s case, the combination of behavior therapy and pharmacological treatment is possible. Cognitive-behavioral treatment can be implemented for treating Robert’s OCD, including exposure and response prevention and cognitive restructuring (Moody, 2017). It is expected that Robert will feel relief from his symptoms within several weeks.",
    "Physical examination of the affected regions of the skin is necessary. Individuals with cellulitis are likely to have a reddened region of the skin, swelling as well as intense pain (Brown & Watson, 2022). Brant experiences pain in his right leg, in a reddened region that is swollen. The affected area should be thoroughly checked for any signs of skin disintegration. Variations in temperature in the area should be monitored along with signs of an abscess (Sutherland & Parent, 2017). Brant revealed that he was bit by a mosquito on the reddened area. This being a seemingly severe case, the physician may order complete blood count (CBC) testing. This will help measure blood count levels (Bennett et al., 2020). A CBC will allow the physician to make an accurate early diagnosis of a wide range of medical conditions. The physician may also order a C-reactive protein (CRP) test, which is a blood test for inflammation. This would be a necessity since Brant has broken skin because of a mosquito bite (Sutherland & Parent, 2017). Brant’s case is an event of major systemic disturbance since there is a manifestation of chills and acute disorientation. Priority diagnostic criteria for Brant would include assessing the occurrence of erythematous inflammation in the basal dermis and subcutaneous tissue. Redness, swelling, and pain are all signs of cellulitis (Sutherland & Parent, 2017). Erythema must be present in order to make the diagnosis. The location and nature of broken skin should also be assessed. For cellulitis to be diagnosed, the patient’s skin must be checked for micro-abrasions resulting from insect bites (Brown & Watson, 2022). Lower limbs are commonly affected. Brant’s positioning and movement should be adjusted. To reduce swelling in the areas facing downward, Brant’s feet and arms should be propped up on cushions while he lays on his back (Zariquiey-Esteva & Santa-Candela, 2017). If Brant stands for a long time, speedy blood flow to the heart may be hindered, which could cause low blood pressure. Brant may also need to be placed on his side in the recovery position, particularly whenever he feels nauseated or feels like vomiting. From the assessment, he feels nauseated and weak and has vomited on numerous occasions (Zariquiey-Esteva & Santa-Candela, 2017). This will help avoid low blood pressure. When germs break through the skin, “cytokines” and “neutrophils” are released into the bloodstream to fight them off. This causes cellulitis, which is characterized by redness, warmth, swelling, and pain (Brown & Watson, 2022, para 5). This appears to have been the case for Brant. He was bitten by a mosquito, which broke his skin, allowing bacteria (Streptococcus pyogenes) to penetrate the area. An outbreak of redness and swelling occurred when “cytokines and neutrophils” were drawn to the area of the skin to fight against the bacteria (Brown & Watson, 2022, para 5).",
    "One of the distinct characteristics of the nursing craft is the professionals’ need to constantly adapt to the dynamic environment of health care service and approaches to patient care. In order to facilitate this process, researchers have identified a series of change theories that seek to systematize the experience of implementing new practices (Udod & Wagner, 2018). The two most widespread theories of change in the nursing practice are Lewin’s change theory and Roger’s five-step theory. In Lewin’s framework, the change process undergoes three major stages: unfreezing, change proper, and refreezing (Udod & Wagner, 2018). Thus, according to this framework, in order to introduce change, the team needs to acknowledge the existing workflow and “unfreeze” this system, actively participate in implementing change and new functional patterns, and, finally, make the change a new generally accepted standard. Unlike Lewin’s approach, Roger’s model is more oriented towards the staff’s response and acceptance of the change through the gradual shifting process. Indeed, this five-step model implies exhaustive preliminary research, gathering staff’s feedback, conducting a pilot study, and actually implementing the change proposal (Udod & Wagner, 2018). Hence, it may be concluded that while Lewin’s model addresses mostly the implementation of the evidence-proven modifications, the five-step model is designed to prove the suggested change beneficial to the clinical environment. When speaking of the change proposal for the capstone project, Roger’s approach to change implementation is more appropriate. Considering the fact that the project seeks to justify the hypothesis of the EBP training’s positive impact on nurses’ self-esteem and patient satisfaction, the data collected from the intervention will be crucial for further implementation of this change to nursing practice. This theory has also been proven advantageous by the preceptor, as she has successfully integrated changes into the staff’s scheduling patterns using Roger’s model.",
    "It is necessary to fully understand the fundamental difference between the concepts of a leader and a regular employee in any field. While the head of the company is most often focused on the internal financial processes, a good leader understands the paramount importance of employees in any enterprise. The ideal leader sees the potential in every person and helps them develop to the maximum while working with them in the same direction instead of putting pressure. The policy of actions of flawed leaders can lead to more than unpleasant consequences for all sides of any business. Unfortunately, imperfect leaders in our time can be found a lot in any field. Bad experiences can happen on any level, from personal to global. It is particularly difficult to single out a specific person without personal experience and hard evidence, but statistics show an extremely high proportion of unscrupulous people in high positions. According to available data, the owner of Ali Express online retailer, Jack Ma, can be cited as an example. Plenty of evidence suggests that most of the items available to order are made by underage children from the poorest parts of the world. With the tacit consent of Jack Ma, many thousands of people are being exploited for minimal pay and terrible living conditions. It is an example of a person who is not only a bad leader but intentionally contributes to the violation of human rights. One of the biggest problems, in this case, is the lack of empathy and humanism. A bad leader always looks at people through the prism of a solid resource and cheap labor. It is difficult for an imperfect leader to hear and understand a person’s intentions through the prism of ignorance and selfishness. It is the absolute wrong approach, leading to nothing but a dead end. However, it should be noted that any statement in this vein is a serious accusation and requires additional thorough collection and analysis of data. The exploitation of people in any level of relationship, from business to politics, cannot lead to a successful and fulfilled conclusion. The best people and professionals will not tolerate such an attitude and quickly find a replacement with better conditions. The main mistake of many leaders in any business is an overly egocentric picture of the world and a tendency to immoral exploitation of people’s resources.",
    "Developing a contract so that all parties involved could be aware of their obligations and meet them accordingly is one of the vital tasks for an organization. Charles Schwab, an organization offering banking and brokerage services, has developed a contract for its users to sign so that both parties could meet the respective requirements (Reder et al., 2021). For their collaboration. Since the contract in question contains the essential components of a legal agreement, it can be considered viable. Starting with the key definitions of the foundational concepts on which the agreement is based, Schwab’s contract establishes the offer, acceptance, and legality terms from the start exceptionally clearly. The specified clarity and transparency benefit the company and its customers, promoting immediate trust and cooperation (Templin, 2017). Remarkably, Schwab also provides a robust basis for the consideration element of the agreement. Namely, the contract outlines the legal issues associated with the disbursement process, as well as the associated trading concerns (“Schwab account agreement,” 2022). Outlining that Schwab is not responsible for tracking the trading process, the contract sets the key responsibilities and relations between the parties completely clearly. Incorporating the primary components of a legal contract, the brokerage agreement created by Schwab offers its customers a chance to familiarize themselves closely with the services that they will obtain and the responsibilities that they have. Similarly, the contract outlines the crucial responsibilities of Schwab, thus, creating a basis for cooperation and the successful delivery of the end product to the customer. Overall, Schwab’s approach to contract development can be considered a prime example of how a contract should be structured due to the close focus on key issues and the clear delineation of all parties’ roles and rights.",
    "Differences between primary and secondary sources Primary sources are the ones providing first-hand evidence on the events or phenomena that one is studying. Such sources include diaries, photographs, video and audio recordings, interview transcripts, works of art, statistical data, and others. All of these types of sources give the researcher a possibility to learn about the investigated matter directly by observing it or reading/listening about it from first-hand witnesses. In case of the Chernobyl Nuclear Plant Disaster, the most relevant primary sources include reports, documents, and local newspapers of that time, photographs, and interviews of witnesses. By using such resources, one can obtain the possibility to learn unbiased facts and obtain the most relevant information about the event or phenomenon under investigation. Moreover, when analyzing primary sources, the researcher can become immersed in the atmosphere in which the object of investigation existed and the circumstances under which it developed. For instance, for historians and archeologists, such primary sources as ancient fossils or some tribes’ belongings serve both as sources of information and inspiration. On the other hand, for someone analyzing a political or environmental issue, reports and pertinent news releases will be helpful sources of reliable data. Meanwhile, secondary sources offer second-hand information and analyses from other researchers. Secondary sources include books, reviews, and scholarly articles investigating the subject of research. By analyzing secondary sources, one can get a deeper understanding of both the analyzed phenomenon and the primary sources. While primary sources offer a first-hand view of the situation, secondary ones enable the researcher to synthesize the material on the topic. Explain why it is important to consult a variety of sources when conducting historical research Both types of sources are crucial in research since they complement each other. Whereas primary sources offer credible evidence, secondary sources provide additional information and valuable synthesis. However, even when one possesses a primary and a secondary source, it is not enough for completing a thorough research endeavor. One needs much more than a few sources, however credible they might be. It is of utmost importance to consult a variety of sources when conducting historical research since in each new source, valuable additional evidence can be found. Also, when the same data occurs in several sources, its credibility increases. At the same time, the presence of different pieces of information gives the researcher food for thought and allows posing new questions and seeking new answers. That is why the more sources one has at one’s disposal, the better. It is crucial to consult not only a wide range of sources but also different types of them since authors of articles and books, for instance, have divergent approaches to synthesizing data.",
    "The development of the Chesapeake colonies is a bright example of how slavery became one of the integral parts of societies existing on these lands. The necessity to grow specific crops and use them to earn money and survive resulted in the constantly growing demand for the workforce. However, the practice of using indentured servants was ineffective because of the end date of their contracts. It meant that new sources of people to work on fields and plantations were needed. The resolution of the given problem was a matter of survival, as the inability to raise crops would mean death for the whole community (Kidd, 2019). Under these conditions, the development of slavery was inevitable as people stripped of their rights could be used to perform diverse tasks, and the term of exploitation was not limited. It created the basis for the evolution of slavery which became one of the fundamental institutions functioning on these lands. At the same time, the example of the Middle colonies proves that the enslavement of people and their use as a cheap workforce was inevitable. Although the pacific principles of Quakerism dominated these lands at the first stages of their evolution, settlers still needed people to perform complex tasks and support the evolution of colonies. Regarding the limited number of arriving settlers, slavery became the possible option to compensate for the deficit and create the basis for future expansion. The given trend was similar to the Middle and Chesapeake colonies, proving specific attitudes to slavery peculiar to people of that period (Huntley, 2019). They were ready to promote further evolution of this institution as the central way to support the development of the agricultural sector critical for survival and enrichment.",
    "In his writing, Daniel Spanjer claims that the Christian worldview has influenced the study of Liberal Arts. He discusses science and how humans are the products of the world – they are endowed with feeling and thought, which are beyond natural (Spanjer 3). The author differentiates the reasons for learning everything surrounding people and claims that thinkers can answer many questions, either logical or surreal. These people have developed a term worldview “to describe this holistic concept of learning, scholarship, experience and knowledge” (Spanjer 15). Even though sometimes they cannot agree on the solution to the problems, time helps them dissipate false beliefs. The other reading by Brad Green suggests the interconnection of words and faith. In the chapter. When transcendent realities and goals surround a language, it is magnificent, but when transcendence is taken away from it, it falls apart and loses its glory (Green). The word was sent by God to save humanity; He portrayed people through the words (Green). Hence, humans should follow God’s guidelines in the Bible because His sayings are truthful. In case the words are devoid of meaning, the speech is useless. The last reading by Dockery narrates about the Christian faith’s influence on learning. People are encouraged to think in Christian categories in order to sanctify thoughts and beliefs (Dockery 4). It is vital to seek God’s guidance and His calls that help humans contribute to the societal good (Dockery 8). Thoughtful believers are needed to revive faith-centered higher educational institutions because only such people will be able to promote gracious deeds. Hence, Christian worldview is again viewed as foundation of successful education and learning.",
    "Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation (NDT) is a scientific and clinical European journal. It is a collection of articles that analyze dialysis, transplantation, and nephrology research. Moreover, the NDT journal is officially approved by the European Renal Association (ERA). Thus, it presents crucial analysis and data for scientists worldwide. Additionally, the other article from StatPearls was selected as the source is included in the National Center for Biotechnological Information (NCBI). Therefore, the center distributes and stores information about scientifically approved research. The article focuses on the leading causes of chronic inflammation at the time of end-stage renal failure. In addition, the authors describe the impact of disease on clinical outcomes and the role of middle molecules as significant factors in the onset of pathology. The latest breakthroughs and research in dialysis are reviewed to stabilize the situation. The end stage of kidney damage is the stage of the development of chronic renal failure. In this case, the disease enters the final stage and threatens human life and health. Only a decrease in urine excreted (diuresis) is observed at the initial step. At stage 2, other signs appear, and nausea and a large amount of urine appear. At stage 3, the fluid does not leave, and diuresis stops. The kidneys fail, and acute renal failure develops, which leads to a deterioration in well-being. Treatment of end-stage kidney damage in adults involves taking medications. Chronic renal failure occurs in 200-500 out of one million people. Currently, the population with chronic renal failure is increasing annually by 10-12%. Morbidities with the end-stage renal disease lead to a person’s diuresis being reduced to almost zero. With advanced forms of chronic renal failure, pulmonary edema develops. At the moment, the prevalence rate of the disease includes about 759 people per million population. The incidence rate is not available for all countries globally, so it isn’t easy to analyze the information in detail. However, the average number of newly reported cases is 144 per million. The mortality rate is decreasing and currently stands at approximately 28%. Doctors prescribe a blood test to assess creatinine, potassium, and urea to determine the disease. Moreover, such a procedure as an ultrasound of the kidneys is performed. If necessary, the doctor prescribes catheterization of the renal pelvis and angiography of the kidneys.",
    "Elephants dance the polonaise, sea lions juggle balls, bears ride bicycles, a tiger jumps through a burning hoop – all these are attractions with four-legged performers that thrill the audience, especially the little ones. Nevertheless, animal rights activists have sounded the alarm because circus tricks are unnatural for wild creatures; they are considered mockery and torture. There should be a thoroughgoing prohibition on the exploitation of animals in circuses, as this issue is contrary to humane treatment and is a direct violation of their rights. Since the 1970s, numerous nations have been setting up laws to treat creatures and guarantee their essential protection. International agreements were concluded, recognizing that animals are sentient beings whose basic needs must be respected and protected (Marino 148). Significantly, the tricks taught to animals for the public’s entertainment have nothing familiar with their natural behavior. The only way to make them obey is to punish and deprive them of food so that the poor starving creature will do anything for a coveted bite (Arnold-Foster 146). Animals must maintain and express behavior specific to their species, and the concept of circuses contradicts this shepherd. Furthermore, the phrase “animal performers” often evokes positive emotions because acting is always associated with romance. However, unlike their human counterparts, animals never voluntarily choose the profession of actor. Circus experience means losing freedom forever, spending 95% of the time alone, in a cramped cage where animals cannot stand up to the full height and turn around (Ward 131). They suffer extensively, but there is nothing they can change because humans are more thoughtful and cunningly use force. It can be concluded that introducing restrictions on the exploitation of animals in the circus is a necessary measure in the current world. Creatures must be permitted to follow their instincts and be in their natural habitat because that is their fundamental freedom. All people must comprehend that the rights of animals must be protected and, therefore, one must refuse to visit performances that have been created through violence and cruelty.",
    "Commitment to health theory is a special model designed to determine the stages of development and behavior changes. This theory assumes the development of an internal state, as well as the acceptance of the desire to lead a healthy lifestyle under the conditions that any circumstances may limit a person. Moreover, with the help of this theory, the necessary level is determined, which indicates a particular stage of human health (Kelly, 2014). In addition, this theory assumes that there are no established differences, such as gender, race, and others, in order to build behavior aimed at developing a healthy lifestyle. In her research, Kelly (2008) uses the principles of the Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change. First of all, this is done in order to demonstrate certain stages of the change process. Furthermore, the model used sets specific requirements for health. Thus, the Commitment to Health Theory uses such principles as stages of change, decisive balance, and self-efficiency (Prochaska & Velicer, 1997). In this way, Kelly uses essential principles of this theory; thus, they are interrelated. Concerning advanced nursing practice, this theory can be used as a measurement of some patient indicators. Thus, this model will help determine the goals necessary for the patient to instill the desire to lead a healthy lifestyle. In practice, this theory will also help track the process of change and how to behave with the patient (Kelly, 2008). For example, at the first stage, the task is to instill confidence, as well as to indicate the importance of the necessary changes. At the second stage, strategies are already being applied to strengthen the patient’s desire to improve the overall state of health. The third stage is the final one, and it should introduce the behavioral patterns necessary for maintaining a healthy lifestyle. As a result, health care professionals can use stages of change categories and commitment ratings to personalize therapy by employing change-specific tactics and motivating therapeutic communication techniques.",
    "Being a knowledgeable and experienced professional in one’s professional sphere is, without a doubt, of great importance. For this reason, many students of medical education facilities seek to acquire as much theoretical and practical expertise as possible before graduation. Although such a strategy is by no means wrong, I have recently discovered that the true success in the work of healthcare providers is explained by the doctor’s ability to build relationships with one’s patients. I fully understood the advantage of this simple but often overlooked truth when observing Dr. Wang’s work. Dr. Wang is an experienced professional working in the sphere of eye surgery. Yet, it was surprising for me to discover how easily he/she is able to build close relationships with the patients. After analyzing her/his behavior, I realized that there are certain skills that allow Dr. Wang to gain the trust of the people that come to the Eye Surgery Institute. First of all, he/she is an active listener meaning that all of Dr. Wang’s patients are encouraged to fully and openly express their symptoms and feelings without being interrupted. Secondly, Dr. Wang is always polite and patient with people regardless of her/his overall mood. Finally, I noticed that Dr. Wang is friendly with regular patients as she/he is interested in their health and everyday lives. For instance, I heard Dr. Wang asking a woman regarding her daughter’s health because the patient mentioned that the latter was sick during the last session. As a result of such an attitude towards people, I saw that many treated people could share their problems openly with Dr. Wang as they trusted her/him. In turn, I saw that this allowed the professional to deliver better and more accurate treatment. Moreover, seeing the positive outcome that the ability to build a trustful relationship with the patients has on the healthcare provision, I have become determined to develop this quality. In this regard, I hope that my description of Dr. Wang’s practice will also inspire other current and future medical workers to develop their communication skills.",
    "One of the social factors that might impact what groceries are purchased is the lack of healthy food. Addressing Wal-Mart in Forest Part allows me to gather enough information about available products and their prices. For example, one gallon of great value milk is $2.65, one loaf of Sara Lee bread is $2.44, one bag of gala apples is $3.58, and one bag of organic baby carrots is $3.88. Continuing my visit, the prices are as follows: one yogurt container is $1.92, 2-liter of Pepsi Soda is $1.98, one bag of chips is $2.84, and one family-size pack of cookies is $3.98. In Maywood, IL 60153, the population is mostly African Americans (68.6%), but white citizens (18.2%) and Hispanic/Latino (26.9%) also live there (United States Census Bureau, n.d.). The chosen living area lacks good grocery stores, but the number of fast-food restaurants has significantly increased during the last few years. It means that people are not able to buy healthy food but have to eat poor-quality products, contributing to their health problems like hypertension and diabetes. Another social factor that affects human health and shopping habits is poor transformation and the impossibility for the working class to visit Wal-Mart regularly. The median household income in the chosen region is about $50,176, and the poverty level is about 15% (United States Census Bureau, n.d.). It means that not all individuals can go to the stores with good food and make decisions, not at the expense of their health. The combination of transportation, low income, and food factors are critical for public health (Islam, 2019). It is not enough to identify a problem but find ways to solve it and help the population achieve improvements. A community health nurse (CHN) is responsible for promoting public health and the choice of interventions to address food security. According to Schffer and Strohschein (2019), there are 17 interventions introduced in five groups with different colors, and collaboration is a unique opportunity for all community members to promote and protect health. The main characteristics of this intervention are a high commitment level, partnership, and goal orientation (Schffer & Strohschein, 2019). Collaboration at systems levels helps CHNs reach all appropriate stakeholders, community collaboration is necessary to analyze the current state of affairs, and cooperation with families improves personal knowledge and engagement.",
    "In the history of mankind, the computer has become one of the most important inventions. Hardly anyone can imagine a modern home or office without computers. While some people argue that the computer has provided us with additional conveniences, according to others, the computer has made our life more complex and stressful. I believe that computers, in the first place, have enriched our society with several advantages due to faster communication and easier access to information. The computer provides us with a fast way to communicate. In our time, when modern society is becoming more global, computers play an essential role in communication systems. Previously, communication was limited to means such as mail (Grudin, 2017). If a businessman traveled abroad, the sending of reports and reports, as a rule, was accompanied by significant delays. Since the competitiveness of a business depends on time, this situation was completely unacceptable. The Internet has allowed businesses to send messages instantly. Staff can send emails or instant messages to a manager anywhere in the world (Grudin, 2017). This has added efficiency to businesses and expanded business opportunities. For me, a computer is a technological necessity that makes my life more enjoyable and interesting. First of all, a computer is an excellent leisure tool. Watching movies and various sci-fi programs through my electronic companion is very convenient and comfortable. Also, my daily work, which brings me the lion’s share of my cash income, is not in the least tied to the computer, so it is not just a means of interactivity and entertainment but also a tool for making money. Physicians and other healthcare workers use computers for many essential uses. Computer hardware is widely used in making a diagnosis, conducting examinations and preventive examinations are examples of computer devices and methods of treatment and diagnosis (Farinella & Marco, 2018). Computed tomography and nuclear medical diagnostics provide accurate layered images of internal organ structures (Farinella & Marco, 2018). Ultrasound diagnostics and probing, using the effects of the interaction of incident and reflected ultrasonic waves, opens countless possibilities for obtaining images of internal organs and studying their condition. The diagnostics and treatment methods will be much easier with the help of computer intervention.",
    "In relation to building construction, Code of Practice may be defined as a particular set of standards, procedures, and regulations to which a contractor and developer should adhere to manage potential environmental consequences caused by construction works. For large clients, local authorities, and public bodies, it is applied to new developments and sets out requirements related to the impact of construction. It aims to provide guidance within the framework of legal, administrative, and technical systems for the protection of workers, the environment, and the public and control over major hazard installations. According to the code, by arranging separation between large centers of population, including housing, shops, schools, and hospitals, and major hazard installations and developing appropriate emergency planning, major accidents that may occur at these installations will be prevented. Code of Practice is applied to major hazard installations identified on the basis of a list of hazardous substances associated with threshold quantities. They require priority attention due to the potential for causing highly serious incidents that may negatively impact the environment and people. Thus, major hazard installations include oil refineries, petrochemical and chemical works, storage of flammable liquids, gas, and liquefied petroleum gas, fertilizer works, chemical warehouses, and water treatment works connected with chlorine. Nuclear hazards, hazards of a military nature, and the transportation of potentially hazardous chemicals are excluded from the code due to the differences in their control and management. In general, the code includes a list of activities for competent authorities that should be performed in order to establish major hazard control systems for the prevention of incidents. Competent authorities include government inspectorates and safety authorities, police, local authorities, workers and their representatives, works managements, fire and health authorities, suppliers of major hazard technologies, and other involved organizations.",
    "In the present day, the preservation of Confederate statues provokes multiple discussions. According to the official political agenda supported by former President Donald Trump, these monuments are the historical symbols of the United States that should be protected. However, more and more evidence supports the public opinion that Confederate statues should be removed as they aim to demonstrate racial disparities and the supremacy of Whites. The main argument of this claim is supported by the fact that the majority of monuments were erected not directly after the Civil War but in the 1900-the 1920s (Best, 2020). During this period, several discriminatory laws against Black people’s social rights were enacted. The construction of Confederate monuments was sponsored by the United Daughters of the Confederacy. In the present day, it was regarded as a part of the union’s long-lasting strategy that aimed to strengthen White supremacy and social inequities based on race. The connection of statues with structured racism is obvious as the second wave of Confederate monuments’ erection was in the 1920-1940s, along with “Black Americans’ fighting for civil rights and pushing back against widespread lynchings in the South” (Best, 2020, para. 4). Thus, Confederate monuments placed across Southern states, especially on courthouse grounds, aimed to demonstrate the protection of Whites by the law. The undeniable racial context of monuments’ construction has finally led to their removal or relocation during the last several years in response to discrimination against Black citizens. From a personal perspective, it is impossible to deny that Confederate statues were directly connected with efforts to strengthen White supremacy. That is why a considerable number of them may be removed – however, not all. In general, human history includes both positive and negative events. Although a considerable number of people prefer to destroy all attributes of tragic times, they should be remembered as well. In other words, mistakes of the past should be remembered for their avoidance in the future.",
    "Conflict management at the workplace is one of the crucial elements related to the organization of work in healthcare facilities. In this regard, McKibben (2017) asserts that conflict is an inevitable part of any human interaction, especially when the collective activity is associated with physical, mental, and ethical complexity found in hospitals. Consequently, if ignored or not handled adequately, the disputes between the colleges at the workplace lead to decreased performance and satisfaction levels of the involved employees (Suifan, Alhyari, & Sweis, 2020). This, in turn, negatively impacts the overall quality of provided patient care. Therefore, it is important to resolve the conflicts as soon as they appear. However, to understand how to manage disputes effectively, one should understand the factors that cause them. In general, all the antecedents of organizational conflicts may be divided into three groups, namely individual, interpersonal, and organizational. As for the former, Kim et al. (2017) argue that the healthcare professional’s self-esteem, self-focus, emotional intelligence, prevalent responses to conflict, communication styles, and overall worldview determine the frequency and severity of the disputes. In a similar vein, Chang, Chen, and Chen (2017) found that a person’s license level, age, and previous experience of working in other collectives can all affect the behavior during conflict situations. Interpersonal conflicts, on the contrary, are caused by such factors as lack of trust and respect towards a person, power abuse, and ineffective communication (Kim et al., 2017). Finally, organizational conflicts stem from the overall structure and work arrangement. In this respect, such factors as ambiguously defined responsibilities and inadequate hierarchy can cause dissatisfaction and disputes (Kim et al., 2017; McKibben, 2017). Therefore, this type of conflict appears as a result of weak or wrongful management decisions. I have also participated in several conflicts that can be explained by the factors mentioned above. Firstly, I have a friend who is generally a good person but who is quite self-focused; thus, he often fails to recognize other people’s opinions. Due to that, we usually have to do what he wants, which eventually leads to conflict when I become tired of compromising. Secondly, I have noticed that many conflicts between me and my parents and friends are caused by my inability to control one’s emotions. Finally, once, we had a conflict with my classmates while working on the team project as we failed to discuss the responsibilities of each person before starting.",
    "In many philosophies, some archetypes can be described as the perfect self in terms of the way of living one’s life. In Confucianism, such a man called junzi — a noble person or gentleman — is a common aspiration (Yu-kit 223). The combination of the highest qualities that an ideal human being should possess is an almost unachievable goal, yet the one that is held in high regard by many. This essay will describe the Confucian gentleman and compare this idealistic archetype with Plato’s philosopher-king. This idea that stems from the traditional Chinese culture continues to hold its importance for society. Such a man stands above evil ideas, recognizes them, and counteracts their effects to the best of their abilities (Yu-kit 225). Moreover, the Confucian gentleman helps others to do so through the transfer of knowledge (Yu-kit 223). Yu-kit writes that a noble person, according to Confucius, must take “a dual role of an exemplar and educator” (224). Virtues are the second nature of this man, and he exhibits them daily. The Confucian gentleman is the one who lives by the highest moral standards and aims to help others achieve the realization of this goal. Plato’s philosopher-king possesses several similarities to this archetypical role. They both are set to exhibit certain positive moral qualities while addressing negative ones through reason and rationale. He is ultimately humble and stoic and continuously seeks wisdom for the sake of the betterment of society (Mark). Notably, Plato’s archetype is more leaning toward education rather than living life as a role model for others. In conclusion, both roles possess certain qualities that define a noble person following moral qualities, such as kindness, fairness, selflessness, and the striving for harmony. However, Plato’s version of an ideal person is a stoic leader who puts wisdom at the highest value, while the Confucian gentleman is set to uphold moral values first. They are both set to uplift the personal values of other people through kindness and selflessness.",
    "Corporate entrepreneurship is the process by which groups inside an existing corporation build, foster, promote, and administer a new business distinct from the parent organization. However, these new entities emphasize the parent’s holdings, competitive positioning, knowledge, or other capabilities. The new groups may also be an oxymoron while again utilizing the unconventional approach to further economic growth alongside the meticulous planning, framework, and organization that several large firms have developed over time (Demirkan et al., 2019). Instead of reclining on their glories, the world’s wealthiest organizations, such as Amazon as well as Samsung, are progressively undertaking proactive innovation projects to prevent disruption. Amazon Custom is an excellent extension of an existing innovative initiative that has reaped the benefits of both evolutionary and radical tactics. As the name indicates, this ambitious new approach allows suppliers to provide customized items on Amazon for the first time (for example, custom text, customization, and so on) (Demirkan et al., 2019). Samsung’s innovative business strategy entails delegating new projects to an expert ‘creative elite,’ guaranteeing that they are prepared to include best practices and produce maximum KPIs (Demirkan et al., 2019). To achieve these objectives, the industry’s inventive elite use open innovation as well as corporate technical reconnaissance strategies. New product advocates explore ideas for new merchandise by independent strategic orientation, a bottom-up method. The iPod is an excellent example. It was built with the help of the company’s workers’ staffing and engineering knowledge. This approach adheres to the company’s existing strategies. Inspired strategic behavior is a top-down procedure in which policy is processed via the company’s pre-existing hierarchical structure (Demirkan et al., 2019). This process is consistent with the firm’s existing approaches, with the iPhone serving as an example. As a result, the most likely commercial development is induced business strategy. The focus of creative behavior strategy is on human effort rather than the technological aspect. It includes new ideas, products, and procedures into a person’s position. He subsequently becomes an expert in the field and works for the firm to generate fresh ideas.",
    "It is clear to modern people, as well as many people who lived in the 1930s, that the Second World War was inevitable. Some believe that the United States of America could prevent the outbreak of the war. However, this could hardly be possible due to several reasons. The American government maintained an isolationist foreign policy in the 1930s. The period was challenging as all countries had to address severe economic issues (Corbett et al., 2021). Americans wanted to concentrate on domestic matters, including a threatening spread of communist ideas (Russett, 2019). It is noteworthy that the USA could hardly interfere and have a considerable impact on European affairs due to the country’s comparatively low economic might. The United States was not a financial leader at that period, so its influence was limited. Moreover, the USA alone could not prevent the world war because it was outbroken as a result of the clash between European countries. The outcomes of the Treaty of Versailles laid the ground for the new war, as almost all stakeholders were dissatisfied. Germany accumulated resources and developed alliances with other dictatorships, so any country could not play a decisive role in this conflict. No nation could prevent the start of the new war as the regimes that emerged in Europe (the communist USSR, Nazi Germany, and fascist Italy) were likely to start a new military conflict that would inevitably grow into a world war. Therefore, it is possible to assume that the USA could not have prevented the start of the Second World War even if the American government had abandoned its isolationist foreign policy. At that, the country made a tremendous contribution to stopping the war and establishing a new world order.",
    "This paper will provide an analysis of the article “COVID-19: Impact on Nurses and Nursing” by Fauteux (2021). The abstract is supposed to be the opening of the article. It is a way to quickly introduce the reader to the results of the research. In this article, the abstract is a brief overview of the topic that will be discussed. However, it contains no information about the methods of the research or its results. On this basis, such an abstract cannot be called comprehensive. The article’s introduction is already more extensive, offering a general overview of the topic. It provides information that the times of coronavirus pandemic have affected nursing. In addition, the introduction has statistics, which introduce the reader to the subject in a tangible way. From the introduction, I learned about the general factors of COVID’s effect on nursing, including increased mortality, changes in work practices, and increased workload. This introduction can be considered extensive and adequate. The research method of this article is qualitative in that a review of a body of research draws empirical conclusions. These conclusions relate to the significant changes that have occurred in nursing and its nature. The study uses quantitative data that has already been processed and presents an overview of information previously analyzed. The result of the study is the identification of the main factors of change in nursing. These include the intensification of collaboration and innovation, the removal of practice barriers, the popularization of telemedicine, and the increased risks of burnout (Fauteux, 2021). I learned how much nursing has been affected by the pandemic. I was mostly interested in the increased risk of nurse burnout due to too much workload. I also learned about the popularization of telemedicine due to the pandemic, which was a revelation to me because the attitude of the patients to their health seems to have drastically changed after the virus outbreak. This article is beneficial in understanding how an entire division of medical practice can change under extreme conditions.",
    "Historically, law enforcement was founded on the need to ensure citizens’ safety, possession, and health and to safeguard the people from civil disorder and crime. As such, Harris (2020) shows that law enforcement’s lawful powers included using force legitimized by the government or arrests through a monopoly on violence. In its primitive system, law enforcement clan members banded together to enforce rules of the group on rogue members. The purpose behind enforcing societal directives, conducting human control, and empowering authoritative enforcement of those rules was to safeguard the people from rogue members. The community believed that any form of violence against any of them was tantamount to an attack on the rest (Harris, 2020). Therefore, to achieve its purpose, early law enforcement employed three fundamental features, no coercion, law enforcement had a wide array of tasks. The third feature was a critical distinction between the people legally endowed with policing responsibilities and those who carried out policing duties. Peace offices have the mandate of ensuring that whether on or off duty, they shall not commit any crime knowingly under the country’s laws. In the U.S., for example, peace officers are bound by local and state jurisdiction not to commit a crime. The other responsibilities of the peace officer are to not knowingly disobey the rule of law on criminal procedures, especially in such areas as detention, arrests, evidence preservation, and the use of informants (Schroeder & Lombardo, 2018). Further, no peace officer shall exceed their authority when enforcing the law, and no individual freedom shall be restricted by peace officers (Schroeder & Lombardo, 2018). Only except the law is police officers allowed to disobey the rule of law relative to the criminal procedures.",
    "The phenomenon of slavery is one of the most devastating factors that affected the lives of people of African descent throughout the years. However, it is essential to address the origins of racism and slavery in order to create a comprehensive understanding of these concepts. In the chapter “The Origin of Negro Slavery”, Williams explains that although currently slavery is deeply connected to the exploitation of African Americans, initially, populations of various races and ethnicities were occupied as enslaved people (Williams 7). Considering that individuals of all races were involved in slavery in the New World, racism emerged as a consequence of forced labor and was not originally connected to the targeted discrimination of African Americans. In the history of slavery, the first population compelled to undergo the severe process of enslavement was the Indians. For instance, Spanish explorers utilized Indian labor in their colonies to convert the population to Christianity, enforcing the necessity of slave labor on the individuals who refused to accept the Christian faith (Williams 8). Similarly, Great Britain and France supported slavery in the colonial territories; however, this event was not connected to racial predispositions but to the fact that slavery served as a preventative penalty for the indigenous communities. Nevertheless, over the course of history, enslaved Negroes became a highly more important asset in the slave trade due to the economic benefits, leading to the establishment of Negro slavery as a normal condition (Williams 21). As a result, racism and racial discrimination emerged, but the initial origin for substituting other enslaved people with African Americans remained economic, not racial. To conclude, the connection between slavery and racism lies in the fact that racial predispositions towards African Americans were caused by the overwhelming use of enslaved African Americans. As such, slavery did not emerge as a result of racism; on the contrary, individuals from various races and ethnic communities were involved in the slave trade. Nevertheless, after the economic benefits of using enslaved African Americans were established, negative racial stereotypes began to emerge, leading to the occurrence of racism.",
    "Culture is the entirety of social norms, behaviors, and customs which distinguish a certain society from the rest of the world. Naturally, some cultures have common features, thus forming cultural clusters. At the same time, leadership is a personality trait that transcends national boundaries. This does not imply that all people with power behave in the same manner, as leaders are also influenced by cultural norms. Behavior differences are evident in the way people in different clusters view time. Middle Eastern cultures are frequently juxtaposed to Western ones, particularly American. Beehner writes that while “most Middle Eastern nations are past oriented” and uphold traditions, “many Americans believe they can control the future and embrace change for the sole purpose of changing” (72). Barak Obama is an example of a leader who gained prominence by articulating the importance of change. The list of differences in leadership behaviors is not limited to the perception of the future. Crede et al. have conducted a study in which they ascertain cultural differences in relation to transformational leadership. (23). The most peculiar finding is that “transformational leadership exhibits stronger relationships with subordinate performance in cultures with low levels of gender egalitarianism values” (Crede et al. 23). This implies that the more traditional a culture is, the more successful leaders are likely to be in transformational endeavors. Altogether, there is a definite influence of culture on the conduct of leaders. Therefore, the definition of culture should include the importance of its effect on leadership behaviors. Not only does culture distinguish a certain social group, but it also underscores the likelihood of changes driven by people who have authority. After all, these people are the ones who make the most important decisions in society.",
    "The concept of culture is a fundamental phenomenon influencing all spheres of human life. It influences people’s actions, methods, and approaches toward specific tasks and daily interactions. Thus, Roseberry determines culture as a socially constructed and socially constitutive part of the context where all activities take place. It means that all other fundamental institutions and phenomena, such as power, economy, and history, comprise the culture. At the same time, being the way of life, it influences the mentioned spheres and preconditions for the emergence of critical processes in these domains. In other words, peculiarities of culture influence decision-making in political processes and historical events which took place at different stages of society’s evolution. Furthermore, the approaches to business in particular, and economy in general, depend on the values and visions peculiar to a bearer of a particular culture. For this reason, by understanding history and politics, it is possible to understand this unique notion and its layers. Rosebery also assumes that culture is socially constituted, meaning that many cultures share the same visions and values. For example, my own culture is similar to the culture of my friends and the people surrounding me as we live within the same context and share similar approaches. However, at the global level, my system of beliefs and visions differs from the same framework used by people from other regions to guide their decision-making and actions. It is explained by the social nature of culture and its unique character. It includes different perspectives and attitudes shared by people from similar communities and, at the same time, it influences their mentalities and visions. For this reason, it is possible to conclude that culture is a social construct influencing social interactions and fundamental institutions vital for everyday interactions.",
    "The process of forming states is not characterized by ease. It involves many different processes, including cultural strategies of strength. It is believed that this aspect in the form of actions of social agents is of particular importance. This is because they occupy a central place in such processes as the formation of alliances and the establishment of dominance relations. Understanding this concept can give a better understanding of the creation of Western Europe, China, the Islamic World, and India. First, it is necessary to understand what a social strategy of power is and what significance it has. Thus, it is defined as a particular area of practice where the creators of mass media have cultural influences and act as agents of social change. Thus, these sources form and influence public opinion, which may affect the formation of states. Gledhill emphasizes that the main reason for the difference between state and stateless societies is the centralization and non-centralization of power. Thus, the absence of the second aspect is expressed in inequality, and the absence of citizenship is associated with decentralization and vice versa with equality. Therefore, in conclusion, to understand the emergence of the state in the case of Western Europe, China, the Islamic World, and India, it is necessary to consider the culture strategy of power. Therefore, the author makes an attempt to distance from the generally accepted European principles and views on the role of social anthropology and factors in Chapter 3. In addition to many other political and economic factors, social influence is of significant importance. Social agents form public opinion and contribute to the formation of opinions. In this way, there is a relationship in the creation of the states of Europe, China, the Islamic World, and India and the social strategies of the authorities.",
    "Modification of personal computers required the development of more complex hardware and software. For example, buses, which are the communication channels between different internal components and peripheral devices, have become more advanced. Such three types of buses as address, control, and data are known (Farret et al., 2017). The latter is utilized for data exchange between the Central Processing Unit (CPU) and peripherals (Farret et al., 2017). The significance of the address bus is to assist the CPU in locating specific information in the memory, while the control bus regulates data processing. Data buses are represented as a multiple of two and currently include five types: 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 (Farret et al., 2017). These numbers indicate the bits of data that can be delivered simultaneously, and the larger ones allow for a more significant amount of information to be processed at a time. The number of parallel lines in a processor defines how many electrical signals can be exchanged between peripherals and the CPU. The most common operating systems on modern computers are 32 and 64-bit microprocessors. A 32-bit data bus contains thirty-two parallel lines between different structures. In contrast, a 64-bit data bus consists of sixty-four lines, allowing it to run twice as many data exchange processes (Farret et al., 2017). Hence, the fundamental difference between these two types of data buses is the speed at which they can process information. Similarly, the pace at which older versions run data depends on the number of paralleled copper wires between the CPU and other internal parts. Indeed, all these buses have one common function of interchanging data, but they vary in the rate at which operations are transferred due to their structural differences.",
    "Data science is the discipline that studies the life cycle of digital data from appearance to use in other fields of knowledge. It involves researching and analyzing substantial amounts of information and is focused primarily on obtaining practical results. The definition suggested by Os Keyes presumes that this science is the reduction of humanity to something that can be counted. This perspective is engaging in a way that Keyes’s perspective opposes the standard definition of data science. Perhaps, her expression implies that everything in this world could be measured since the discipline is concerned with countable objects and quantitative analysis. There is also an assumption that data science systems want to devour everything possible, including a human’s life, and quantify it. Finally, when it comes to the decision-making process, the systems eliminate the human factor, excluding individuals, thus making it inhumane. Numerous standardized tests are based on an algorithm that does not allow people to express their opinions. Typically, they are multiple-choice credits where one should choose the right answer. One mistake and one is at a point of no return. It means that systems only accept correct data, not allowing a human to err. As a result, humanity is accustomed to giving the right answers when necessary and at the same time being afraid to say something that will not be automatically approved. On the other hand, data science is vital in areas where mistakes should be avoided. For example, in healthcare, workers use different electronic systems that assist them in choosing the proper treatment and its dosage. Medication errors occur due to human factors mainly, for instance, when professionals forget to check the expiration date of a drug. Meanwhile, the system will suggest which pharmaceutical is better for the patient and ensure it is not expired.",
    "It was genuinely surprising to read Gerai’s account about the Dayak community, as it seems to represent an almost utopian view on sex and gender. Unlike Western perspectives that seek to distinguish the two genders, and raise one up at the expense of the other in some ways, the Dayak recognize the differences but see it as a benefit. Reading the account, it almost seemed as the culture promotes the empowerement of both genders based on the characteristics which define them (i.e., male strength, female persistence). These positives are then brought together to contribute to the wellbeing of society as well as personal relationships in a nearly egalitarian perspectives. It is difficult to believe, although greatly comforting to know that there are cultures as this. Unfortunately, most industrialized societies have the culture of severe gender clashes, and the characteristics of the gender are associated with negative aspects, such as Gerai notes, male strength is connected to aggression. I think it is correct to note that it is a matter of values, the values that are taught by society are the ones that people would exhibit. Western society gives value to hypermasculinity and aggression as definitions of males, exemplified via the genitalia and abusive actions such as sexual domination, assault or rape – therefore, the culture forms around this, being far removed from the egalitarianism and harmony of the Dayak. As shocking as that perspective may be, I agree that it reflects accurately the social element that has been created conservatively around rape for centuries. As mentioned earlier, rape is often attributed to natural biology, while in reality it reflects more the concepts of society. I think this perspective touches on both, it emphasizes the natural characteristics of the genders (strength for men, femininity for women) while highlighting its social features (men are praised, women are viewed as used and broken). It can be argued that it is built within our society, as there are certain connotations and stereotypes associated with sexual violence. For example, in a UK study, the label victim was associated with passive femininity. The feminization hypothesis holds true when it comes to rape, as victims, that are most commonly women (but can be men) are attributed feminine characteristics and greater judgment (men would not be seen as men anymore). Meanwhile the accused of committing the rape is given trait dimension of prescriptive masculinity.",
    "With thrombosis of the lower extremities’ veins, blood clots or blood clots form cavities, which interfere with the normal movement of blood. Over time, they can clog the venous lumen and even come off, ending in the heart, lungs, and other organs (Dalen, 2016). Unfortunately, it is often impossible to timely determine the initial symptoms of thrombosis of the leg vessels. However, if the skin changes color and swelling occurs where the blood clot is located, these are signs of vascular disease. When thrombosis progresses, its symptoms appear: acute pain and heaviness in the patient’s legs. These symptoms are provoked by the venous congestion below the site of thrombosis. The main causes of the disease’s development are blood clotting and damage to the vein wall (Thachil & Bagot, 2018). In addition, long journeys and old age exacerbate the risk of serious problems. It is also possible that the patient is taking medications that increase blood clotting, so it is necessary to ask him about this to be sure of the diagnosis. Ways to make an accurate diagnosis include duplex scanning, radiopaque phlebography, MRI, or CT. The combination of these methods will most accurately determine the severity and nature of the disease. After that, a doctor can prescribe a suitable treatment. Of the drugs, it can be injections of heparin and capsules of anticoagulants. If these methods do not help, then thrombolysis is necessary, which promotes resorption of blood clots. With the most severe outcome, surgery will be required. Undoubtedly, this is the last thing to do since it is always important to use all the other methods before making it. It may also be dangerous in the age of the considered patient. Thus, it is vital to use other methods and try to avoid any harmful consequences. Not only this will help cure thrombosis, but also save patient’s life.",
    "A Western scholarship has distorted the long history of African culture for centuries, and many of its basic principles have been viewed through the lens of colonization. As a result, the ideas and tenets of African philosophy have been appropriated and changed in value from the inherent parts of people’s nature into commodities. In their works, p’Bitek and Marimba discuss such concepts as culture, spirituality, and philosophy of African nations and how Western ideology has reshaped their presentation without fully understanding their meaning. The commodification of African culture and the imposition of European views on the distinction between culture and philosophy, religion and spirituality have disrupted African people’s ability to self-identify. The ideas by scholars show that African culture does not distinguish itself from philosophy or drive a line between reality and the spiritual nature of one’s being. European culture is presented as pragmatical and commodifying – it turns pieces of life that are meant to be used into objects for observation. p’Bitek writes that culture turns from “the way of life of a people” into “something that is bought and sold” (“What is Culture?” 14). As a result, younger generations of Africans, especially those living in Western countries, see their culture as a collection of souvenirs, not parts of everyday life. At the same time, they are subjected to the Western religions praising poverty and individualism (p’Bitek, “Man Born Unfree” 21). Ani notes that African-Americans suffer as they do not feel connected enough to traditional African society but feel a divide between themselves and European identity (49). Such disconnect leads to people losing their communal and generational identification. The readings discussed above show that African and European ideologies clash in many ways, and the latter assumes control over the presentation of the former. As a result, generations of people are removed from their culture, losing it or seeing through the distorted lens of commodification. African culture is inherently linked to philosophy, spirituality, living in the moment, and seeing the richness of life. However, it is turned into a tourist attraction, and its people are forced to perceive it through the eyes of foreigners, losing their inherent link to history and nature.",
    "In a narrow sense, the “zero-sum story” is a belief that there is a competition between racial groups, and any progress for one group is a threat to the resources and position of another (McGhee). This story is the mainstream paradigm for conservative media and has been told in different forms for years. The negative impacts of the “zero-sum” paradigm on the United States are massive and diverse. This mindset created additional economic, political, and social costs for all citizens of the United States. One of the prominent examples demonstrated by McGhee is the history of public swimming pools in cities across the US. At the beginning of the 20th century, there were massive public swimming pools in many US cities, yet at that time “public” mostly meant “white only” pools. After numerous drowning incidents, local municipalities were told to open the pools for all people regardless of their race, which provoked a backlash from the white residents. As a result, cities preferred to close or privatize the public facilities instead of allowing people of different races to use them freely. This is an example of the destruction of public goods and a massive cost increase for the whole population due to the “zero-sum” mindset. Another negative example demonstrated by McGhee is political in nature – many white people stopped pushing for social governmental policies regarding jobs and social benefits after the Black community joined the agenda. In the end, this means less social justice and social benefits for the whole country because the adherents of the “zero-sum” paradigm do not want other races to benefit from these policies. The arguments provided by McGhee seem reasonable and fair to me – they describe the past and current state of affairs in the United States well. The main reason I think so is the factual and statistical support of her position – it is very hard to argue that the US has significant social and economic problems due to racism.",
    "Diabetes of type 1 usually develops due to autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells in genetically predisposed individuals. The damage to beta cells occurs at a subclinical level for months or years in the form of insulitis. Patients with insulin deficiency cannot process glucose in peripheral muscle and fat tissues. This stimulates the secretion of antagonistic hormones such as glucagon, adrenaline, cortisol, and growth hormone (Lee et al., 2019). These antagonistic hormones, particularly glucagon, promote gluconeogenesis, glycogenolysis, and ketogenesis in the liver. Consequently, patients experience hyperglycemia and an anionic metabolic acidosis gap. Type 2 diabetes is the most frequently encountered pathology of the endocrine system organs. The core mechanism of disease development is insulin resistance (Lee et al., 2019). It is a decrease in the biological response of cells to one or more effects of insulin at its average concentration in the blood. Insulin resistance produces the inability of insulin-dependent tissues to absorb blood plasma glucose and disrupts glycogen synthesis in the hepatic. Persons with diabetes should eat according to a structured regimen and receive their medications with meals. For type 1 diabetes, a recommended diet includes carbohydrates from fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and skim milk. Patients with type 2 diabetes, complex carbohydrates such as brown rice, whole wheat, fruits, vegetables, and beans should be included in the rations (Sinclair et al., 2019). At the same time, for both types of disease should be avoided, consumption of simple carbohydrates such as sugar, pasta, white bread, flour, cookies, pastries. During the first type of diabetes, insulin Degludec (Tresiba) is required together with the diet. It is suitable to confound hypoglycemia in patients over 18 years of age. In addition, Zynquista is an oral medication intended to be combined with insulin (Sinclair et al., 2019). Besides, individuals with type 2 diabetes may require insulin if their diet plan, weight loss, exercise, and anti-diabetic medications are not achieving their target blood glucose levels. In that case, Insulin Degludec may also be appropriate; the oral drug is Metformin.",
    "The healthcare industry typically draws sufficient attention to patients’ education, especially when it comes to representatives of minority groups. That is why the article by McCurley et al. (2017) offers valuable information. The researchers demonstrate that Hispanic individuals deal with improved diabetes prevention when they participate in individual and group face-to-face sessions (McCurley et al., 2017). I believe that there is an apparent reason why such positive outcomes are achieved. It seems that face-to-face interventions are effective because patients have an opportunity to ask questions if they require explanations. Simultaneously, such educational sessions demonstrate that a patient is not unique with such a health issue. As a result, such interventions can improve people’s morale, which, in turn, will lead to increased motivation to take preventive measures and protect health. This information allows for supposing that face-to-face interventions can be suitable to my practicum project that considers measures to improve access to care among African Americans with heart failure diseases. However, the focus on patients’ cultural backgrounds should not lead to ignoring a broader context. This statement refers to the findings by Cajiita et al. (2017), who stipulate that the use of mobile technology in healthcare (mHealth) can promote better knowledge. These scholars focused on 129 older adults, and almost 25% were African Americans, to analyze whether mHealth leads to improved care (Cajiita et al., 2017). The use of mobile technologies can be as effective as face-to-face interventions because modern people spend more time online. That is why it is reasonable to rely on mHealth opportunities to improve access to care among African Americans. Finally, it is possible to suggest that combining mobile technologies and face-to-face educational sessions can result in the best outcomes.",
    "In order to prevent heart disease, cancer, and diabetes, people are required to adhere to strict routines, including in terms of diet. According to American Heart Association, people wishing to prevent heart disease must consume food which does not contain added sugars and high volumes of sodium, as well as saturated and trans fats (“Staple Ingredients”). Additionally, individuals need to eat whole grains, vegetables including frozen and canned ones, nuts, seeds, and meat such as chicken and lean beef. American Cancer Society’s dietary recommendations to people include the need to consume more fruits and vegetables, especially dark green and orange ones, since they have a considerable cancer prevention capacity (“American Cancer Society”). Moreover, the society advises people to eat foods high in fiber, such as legumes and whole grains, while avoiding red meats and added sugar. Finally, American Diabetes Association recommends eating more non-starchy vegetables, including broccoli, carrots, cauliflower which need to constitute one-half of each meal (“Eat Good”). The association also highlights the significance of consuming foods high in protein, such as beans, hummus, and lentils, as well as fruits and monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats. The recommendations to prevent the three previously mentioned conditions are, to a large extent, similar. Essentially, all organizations state that it is important to avoid consuming added sugar and saturated and trans fat. Additionally, people wanting to prevent heart disease, cancer, and diabetes also need to eat more fruits, vegetables, and chicken meat. At the same time, red meat is strictly prohibited for cancer patients while generally available for people with diabetes and heart disease. Individuals with diabetes should consume more non-starchy vegetables than people with the other two conditions. Finally, to prevent heart disease, people must particularly be careful about consuming any type of fats.",
    "One is watching the news or reading the latest article from Forbes, and you see the terms “business” and “economics” used interchangeably; one may wonder about the differences. Business and economics are similar in that they are supplements to each other, both dealing with the process of creating products and services and selling them to generate output. These are fields of study that are closely related and include a range of shared subtopics, such as enterprises, marketing, finance, manufacturing, and banking. Both are social sciences that focus on financial measurement and analysis, focusing on variables that impact the market and also focus on short- and long-term projections, as well as the inner workings of various industries. Finally, both business and economics tend to focus on various problems facing the nation, its citizens, government, and private enterprises (Vaidya). However, there are some differences between economics and business, which are based on their conceptual purpose. Economics is a study focusing on understanding human behavior and, in turn, how that reflects on the broader economic elements of whole nations. Meanwhile, business is aimed at studying the process of the exchange of goods and money specifically, and all the related elements starting from production to the final sale, and how a specific enterprise fulfills this process. It can be argued that business is a subset of economics, as the human behavior in that exchange of goods is a point of focus (Casson). A major difference is in concepts, economics deals with theories and broad elements of the economy, such as supply and demand, interest rate, and international trade. While these undoubtedly impact business, both individual entities and as a field of study, business focuses on the process of wealth creation within the context of the economy and typically applies practical theories. Economics focuses on and attempts to maximize the welfare of society, while business is centered on its shareholders. Both face different issues, with economics encompassing poverty, unemployment, taxation, and federal expenditure, while business focuses on product positioning and differentiation, marketing, growth or lack thereof of profitability, and individual or industry performance (Gitman et al.). While business and economics share many commonalities, their conceptual and practical differences make them distinct sciences.",
    "The difference between a doctor approaching a patient in comparison with nursing practice on the same subject can be an excellent topic due to the highlighted features that are emphasized when parallel. Thus, medical practice using one’s physiological status while nursing also implementing psychological responses is an effective way in making the difference between the two clear while operating based on PICOT. The points to be included are the difference in the research approach. Since medical practice is more objective due to the fact that it relies on specific outcomes and facts, the research is quantitative. On the other hand, the PICOT question included in the nursing practice implies mixed research that considers both opinions and data. Topic presents the differentiation between nursing and medical practice in terms of approach to diagnosis. The vital factor that is being brought up is the PICOT in relation to lab results versus assessment based on symptoms. The research can highlight the outcomes in terms of the accuracy of the findings while focusing on the comparison between the two concepts. The aspect that illustrates its importance is the overall parallel between the two models that may have similar results depending on how the research will be conducted and its findings. The potential research focusing on the nursing practice of preventing certain injuries and providing more patient-centered and personalized care can emphasize the importance of decision-making in the field. Decision-making is an essential concept in the nursing care field (Nibbelink & Brewer, 2018). Hence, a PICOT question on the topic of providing specialized care in terms of preventing falls versus solely treating them can be an effective way of discussing nursing from a personalized perspective.",
    "A digital engagement policy determines how the organization intends to position itself online. The regulation also covers the company’s brand qualities and its vision and mission objectives. It also directs how employees can communicate digitally, both internally and externally, with suppliers and clients (Brown, 2019). In addition, the above guidelines also target social media interaction practices that may affect the business, either negatively or positively. Our organization has a digital engagement policy that it utilizes to protect the reputation of its brand. Moreover, the above strategy has enabled the business to increase employees’ commitment while boosting the levels of their obligation. Hence, workers share more about the organization online, thus, contributing to more sales and profit. Additionally, with the above rules in place, the firm’s private information is secure since it is not shared online. My professional presence online is aligned with the organization because it entails displaying the company’s products and services and connecting with all stakeholders. My existence online builds a good relationship with clients, friends, and followers, which is advantageous to the business since the company image has improved. This has helped the organization become relevant because it has offered its clients a ‘human face.’ I use media platforms to promote my brand by focusing on different social networks. I also create informative and engaging content about the company’s products and ensure all the information is up-to-date and accurate before uploading. It is critical to do regular online marketing while avoiding over-posting not to look desperate. All the updates of accomplishments and newsworthy developments are done 3 to 4 times a week. The topics that I frequently post on social media to market my brand are about the pricing of the products. I also emphasize the benefits of using our merchandise and services while comparing with others in the market. I always comment more on the developments and accomplishments achieved but avoid posting any negative comments made by an individual or a dissatisfied customer because this could cause a destructive online discussion, which may diminish the brand. After completing the course, I plan to change how to respond to any negativity, and I will not ignore any undesirable feedback because it enlightens me about the buyer’s experience. In addition, I will also start to market strategically, for instance, to develop a procedure of targeting my audience depending on the social media network, have schedules for my content, and change the communication methods.",
    "The case under consideration, Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S., was significant for developing measures to avoid discrimination in the workplace. More specifically, it was primarily related to diversity in terms of sex and age since this combination frequently evokes the concerns of the population (King, 2021). The examination of the issue by relying on the example of Gerald Bostock was advantageous for establishing proper employment practices in this respect. In this lawsuit filed by the plaintiff, the main factor was his unjustified dismissal from the company in which he had otherwise positive reputation. This event was caused by the man’s interest in a gay softball league which he expressed while being in the workplace while neglecting the provisions of Title VII (Mallory et al., 2020). This part of the Civil Rights Act, confirming the violation, was relied on by Bostock when initiating legal action, but it was initially dismissed by the district court due to its allegedly erroneous interpretation (“Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S.,” 2019). The appeal, including the claim to include sexual discrimination in consideration, was successful as Bostock managed to support his position with the opposing statements of Massachusetts law, Chapter 151B (“Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S.,” 2019). In this way, the meaning of the previously used provisions regulating such cases was modified accordingly. To summarize, the examined court case based on employment law and, more specifically, discrimination against workers happened to be crucial for making adjustments. The previous evidence, as per Title VII of the Civil Rights Act did not include the particular considerations of sex and age. Hence, this gap was compensated for by this decision, and the consequent change in the legal provisions helped guarantee the equality of people in the workplace in the context of their diversity.",
    "There are several types of fake news, ranging from apparent articles to more subtle kinds of deception. People frequently rely on critical decisions on what they read in the news, such as how to vote in elections or what therapy to provide when they are sick. This is why it is critical to have trustworthy news. When individuals can’t identify the difference between true and fake news, critical social and political issues get muddled and misunderstood. A lot of false news is created with the intent of inflaming and exacerbating societal disputes. Most significantly, critical thinking is required while posting or researching on a certain issue, writing comments, and engaging in other social media activities. Many fake news articles are constructed in such a way as to elicit strong emotional responses such as fear or wrath. As a result, critical thinking and research are essential. It’s crucial to examine a few choices when spotting disinformation, recognizing fake news sites, and double-checking before sharing or posting a comment. First and foremost, double-check the source of the news or information. Fake news sites frequently employ addresses that sound like legitimate newspaper locations, but they lack authentic stories on various themes. If the website appears to be unsteady, go to the “About” page and seek a detailed description of the company. Second, look into the author. Check them out to see whether they’re reliable – do they have a strong reputation, and do they write about their field of expertise? Furthermore, the motivation of the author may be essential in the dissemination of forgeries. Third, fact-checking is necessary since trustworthy news reports will include numerous facts such as data, figures, and expert statements. If they aren’t there, inquire as to why. Reports containing misleading information sometimes contain wrong dates or time periods, so it’s a good idea to double-check the article’s publication date.",
    "Geographical distribution and location Banana is a popular fruit crop that grows all over the world and has several health advantages. Bananas are particularly significant in several low-income, food-insecure, least developed nations, where they may help with both household food security and revenue-generating as a cash crop. The crop is a key export item for a number of agricultural nations, and it is Africa’s, Asia’s, and Latin America’s biggest fruit crop in terms of production and commerce (MacKinnon & Cumbers, 2019). Bananas from Central and South America, as well as the Philippines, account for more than 90% of all exports (MacKinnon & Cumbers, 2019). The EU, the USA, China, Russia, and Japan are the top importers (MacKinnon & Cumbers, 2019). Banana output worldwide is projected to be 130 million tons per year (MacKinnon & Cumbers, 2019). Approximately 87 percent of bananas produced in the globe are consumed by farmers or sold in local marketplaces. Almost a third of it is farmed in Sub-Saharan Africa, where it meets more than 25% of the dietary energy requirements of over 100 million people (MacKinnon & Cumbers, 2019). East Africa produces and consumes the majority of bananas in Africa. Spatial Distribution Large supply growth in top exporting nations Ecuador and the Philippines, as well as strong rises in import demand, particularly from China and the European Union, are key drivers of trade (MacKinnon & Cumbers, 2019). Large retail chains from key importing nations are now operating directly in the global banana value chain. These networks buy bananas directly from growers and distributors rather than via typical fruit corporations (MacKinnon & Cumbers, 2019). The intricate web of interactions involved in the production, distribution, and trade of any given commodity may lead to genuine conflicts of interest among groups of individuals over who benefits the most from a product. Cheap bananas are frequently passed on to small farmers and plantation employees down the supply chain, resulting in lower salaries and working conditions (MacKinnon & Cumbers, 2019). Currently, the main issue in terms of spatial distribution is that large-scale banana production may negatively affect the environment, worker health and safety, and local populations. This occurs due to the frequently harsh techniques employed to regulate irrigation and plant diseases. Sources MacKinnon, D., & Cumbers, A. (2019). An introduction to economic geography .

    "Making Budgetary Control Effective A robust organizational structure is required for budgetary effectiveness. Permanent specific concerns, such as a finance committee and a budget director, should be established. To avoid bottlenecks, budget planning must be well integrated. Budgets for individuals should be harmonized with each other. Budgets must be reviewed on a regular basis to avoid them from devolving into a license to spend the entire authorized amount even when it is not necessary. According to Dauda (2019), “business organizations of all types must engage in financial planning at whatever level to ensure judicious deployment of resources for achieving organisational goals.” Workers should be appropriately compensated for performance in accordance with the budget. Sloppy staff, on the other hand, should not go condemned. Behavioral Aspects of Budgetary Control Budgetary control is a crucial instrument for performance evaluation. Nevertheless, findings take time to appear. Those in charge of fiscal control should have extensive knowledge and expertise in the subject. Workers are modifying their working practices, routines, and even their inter-relationships based on finances. As a result, workers may exhibit reluctance to change. It leads to the creation of each budget with the backing of top leadership. Each employee’s requirements are fully described and distributed in a formal structure. If this is the case, they will be aware of their power and responsibilities, which will be valuable for budgetary management. A financial management program’s effectiveness depends on the organization’s defined objectives. As a result, when establishing targets, management should exercise caution. Furthermore, the aims are explicit.",
    "Gendered behavior denotes fundamental expressions of gender socialization and identity through an individual’s various developmental phases. Thus, gendered behaviors refer to the ways persons behave according to their respective male or female genders (Au & Rudolfsdottir, 2021). One of the prominent gendered behaviors instilled in me during childhood was that women are the primary cooks in the home. Hence, from childhood, I learned how to prepare food for the family, unlike most male relatives around. Even the movies mostly depicted women as the cooks in the home. Perhaps the gendered role that I quickly adopted/ accepted from childhood was the idea that women are natural caregivers. The function depicted women as noble people who consider the plight of others in the home and society and consistently seek to alleviate suffering. Women are warm, nurturing, and caring. Thus, many regarded professions that require empathy like nursing and teaching to the women’s domain. The idea that women are more humane and caring appealed to me and caused me to accept the role. In my mind, the part admitted what many would prefer to ignore/ deny: women play critical roles in retaining sanity in the world. For me, the role meant that women could play vital functions in stemming the tide of oppression, suffering, and cruelty evident even from childhood. Therefore, the idea that women are more caring and naturally nurturing appealed to me because it placed the gender on a nobler pedestal. Despite the perceived nobility of the gendered role that women are more nurturing and caring, specific adverse consequences emerged regarding employment opportunities, as previously highlighted. In many ways, many subsequently considered women to be unfit for specific job descriptions like piloting, engineering, and doctors, which were better paying (Samidha, 2019). On the other hand, societies restricted women to courses like nursing and teaching. Most patients assume women caregivers to be nurses rather than doctors in the care centers. Hence, the role may cause conflicts when deciding on career opportunities.",
    "A lot of historical events and time periods have specific names. The renaissance, the enlightenment, the stone age – all of these were called such for a particular reason, and signify a way to differentiate one era from another. One prime example of that trend is the industrial revolution. Also called the industrialization, it was an important part of history and a big step in both technological and social development. Happening at a never-before seen speed, the process has begun and ended in less than a 100 years. The word “revolution” in “industrial revolution” is used to emphasize that fact, and note that the process is regarded as both an extreme and quick advancement in society ( Industrial revolution ). Like a real revolution, it also had a variety of effects on people and their lives. By changing the way work is performed and understood, it fundamentally shifted the people’s understanding of the economy, labor, and the world itself, driving both positive and negative change. For entrepreneurs and people starting their own businesses, the industrialization became a central source of focus and income, replacing the manual labor of people. It also created opportunities for new types of production and large scale manufacturing to be performed. The introduction of complex machinery profoundly affected the workers as well, driving the unskilled labor out of fashion and requiring a higher degree of both education and proficiency. Industrial revolution has made many lose their jobs, while a number of other people have gained new possibilities of employment via migrating into cities (Thompson). Industrialization drove urban development, and contributed to the establishment of the city as a central hub for human interaction. On a larger scale, the ability to mass produce goods and services has allowed countries to establish larger economies, expand trade, and start more thorough relationships with their neighbors. Overall, the industrialization age has had its ups and downs, but the significance of the process is hard to overlook, as it remains the basis for the society people see today.",
    "Miranda warning, also known as Miranda rights, is a formal statement in which a person being arrested is informed of their basic civil rights under the jurisdiction of the United States. Through this warning, an officer of the law enforcement notifies the individual of their right to remain silent, as well as to an attorney. Such principles reflect the foundation of the legal system of the United States, in which both sides are protected by a comprehensive set of rights in order to eliminate bias and enable an objective investigation of the case. The obligatory nature of the warning serves the interests of both sides of the process. First of all, the person being detained possesses an inherent set of rights, which must be respected within the framework of the court of law. They are guaranteed by the United States Constitution, and depriving a person of them would be a major violation of this fundamental law. Rogers and Drogin (2019) state that it would be a misconception to believe that every resident is fully informed of their rights by default. Furthermore, a failure to provide a notification of rights may render the defendant’s testimony inadmissible in court, as it can be dismissed due to possible coercion. This way, Miranda warnings align with the interests of both defendants and prosecutors. On the other hand, it appears possible to argue for the redundancy of rights in some special cases. For example, the arrest of a dangerous criminal or a person responsible for major terrorist threats is often deemed as not requiring a Miranda warning. In such cases, the situation may develop in a matter of seconds, making it necessary to incapacitate the perpetrator before starting legal procedures. From this perspective, it may be contextually appropriate to postpone Miranda warnings until the public safety is secured. In other words, the possibility of a direct, immediate threat to people’s lives outweighs legal formalities (Rogers & Drogin, 2019). Nevertheless, Miranda warnings should not be ignored completely, as they form the core of a transparent trial. Therefore, even if they are not presented at the moment of an arrest, Miranda rights will be given later once the situation is secured and prior to launching formal legal procedures.",
    "The doctor’s job is to follow ethical standards, including loyalty to patients and respect for their choice. However, the profession concentrates on philosophical, religious, and cultural traditions and beliefs. Physician-assisted suicide can be seen as voluntary death by a medical professional. At the same time, the doctor provides all the necessary means and information regarding the patient’s desires for the end of life. However, such cooperation on the part of a doctor cannot be ethically conditioned. Allowing euthanasia can cause irreparable harm to the patient if done incorrectly. Thus, a person can be left without the possibility of a habitual existence. Even though many patients who decide to die to suffer from incurable diseases voluntarily, the doctor cannot assist them. In this case, the moral commandment that a person cannot take someone else’s life is violated (Clarke et al., 2021). Moreover, doctor-assisted suicide is wholly opposed to the definition of a profession aimed at helping people. The doctor is seen as a healer, while physician-assisted suicide does not seem to control and calculate the risks, which can be a threat to many patients. The dilemma lies in the Hippocratic oath given by all doctors, one of the points of which is not to harm. Thus, helping a patient with a death wish can be seen as a deliberate wish to injure the person. Moreover, it may reduce the level of trust between patients and medical staff since taking a life cannot be ethically justified. In addition, the religious view forbids doctors to help patients at the end of life, referring to the commandment not to kill a person. Furthermore, killing may be considered offensive due to society’s moral attitude. The patient’s pain can be alleviated with the help of available medicines, while the loss of life is an irreversible action.",
    "The project aims to explore the questions behind people’s sexual orientation identification and the reasons behind it. Some people consider sexuality a subject of choice; others argue that the environment cannot dictate a person what sex attracts them. The latter group proceeds with the argument that sexuality is determined biologically, making it an aspect of one’s identity, which should be protected by the government (Sheldon et al., 2017). To further explore people’s perspectives on the matter, the project’s topic can be phrased as the following research question: does the environment affect people’s sexual orientation? While exploring the subject of the research, the following dependant and independent variables related to the topic were identified with the help of the GSS database. The dependent variable is sexort, which stands for respondent’s sexual orientation. The question related to this variable is: which of the following best describes you? This variable was chosen due to the fact that it allows determining what environment has surrounded the respondent. The independent variable related to the topic of the project is sexbirth, which stands for the sex assigned at birth. The GSS question for this variable is: What sex were you assigned at birth (for example, on your birth certificate)? The sexbirth variable was chosen since it is necessary to identify respondents’ sexuality and homosexual individuals for the research. There is an essential correlation between the two variables that can facilitate the project’s research. People’s sex identification significantly affects their lives and experiences. For example, the environments surrounding a male and a female can differ critically. As a result, such differences in the environment’s impact can affect people’s identification with sexual orientation.",
    "One of the main purposes of a leader of a business is to select the best course of action out of the available alternatives when it comes to the process of decision-making. Clearly enough, it is impossible without a thorough understanding of a company’s business environment. When it comes to entering the market with the goods for the purchasers’ consumption, the one theory that specialists often take to is the supply and demand theory. This theory is utilized to understand the customers’ buying behaviors and help managers strategize the product in the market in accordance with them. For instance, a lack of demand for the product signifies that supply needs to be shortened – and vice versa: when there is an increase of demand, it is reasonable to enhance supply of goods as well. Additionally, a supply and demand analysis helps in pricing: if the demand for the product is high, buyers are more likely to accept price increases an keep on purchasing it. With the low demand, however, prices should be sufficiently affordable; otherwise, the producer will suffer losses. There are various strategies to make the supply and demand model work to one’s advantage. Dayton cites an example of De Beers – a company specializing in creating diamond jewelry. Their vaults are filled with diamonds – but they manage to maintain high prices for gems by limiting supply. Thus, diamonds keep staying a rare commodity, for the acquisition of which as a status symbol purchasers willingly pay. Another organization using the supply and demand theory to their advantage is Zappo. Dayton states that the company’s primary idea of selling shoes online – that is, with no option of trying them on beforehand – did not seem like a good one. However, Zappo became a success story by having gained control over supply – their enormous assortment, excellent customer service, and a favorable return policy make buyers choose them time and time again. Finally, there is Apple – a renowned giant of the technology market. Their building of anticipation for the release of a service or a product is a manufacturing demand that makes purchasers feel like they are a part of something bigger than simply another gadget’s market entry. In conclusion, a supply and demand theory can definitely be used as a tool for navigating the market – one only has to search for appropriate ways to use it to their product’s advantage.",
    "The influence of social networks is increasing, pushing traditional media to second place. In particular, Twitter platform has become an influential tool for obtaining current information and even conducting debates on various topics. However, tweets can also be different and may or not impact society. This paper examines the Australian politician Bill Shorten’s tweet concerning the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS). Although the politician reports a joyful event in his message, he also expressed regrets about the current policy, limiting the NDIS activity. This tweet is meant to be both informative and grievance. At the same time, the author reports that the girl received assistance thanks to NDIS funding but also regrets that this was possible only after public coverage of the situation. As a result, Shorten deplores the current policy of the Australian government because of which NDIS has limited capacity to help people. While his tweet simultaneously has both negative and positive messages, it can have a positive impact. Criticism from an influential politician can draw attention to the problem and call on society and government to solve it. Several signs indicate the impact of the investigated tweet is. According to Casero-Ripollés (2020), activity, popularity, and authority are the main signs of influence. This post received 209 retweets, 50 comments, and 858 likes – such activity for a poorly discussed topic is quite a significant influence. However, the popularity of the issue is low, and in relation to the population of Australia, such indicators are small. Assessing authority, one can say that Shorten as a politician, is aware and concerned about the topic and has experience and knowledge to express an authoritative opinion. Thus, the tweet may be influential in discussing the activities of NDIS but not on the national scale.",
    "There is a growing number of physicians’ encounters with the victims of human trafficking, sometimes even without recognizing them as such. Recently, Todres (2017) reported an incident, where Dr. W was requested to screen the women-employees of such a firm for sexually transmitted infections. On the one hand, according to the Code of Medical Ethics of the American Medical Association (2011), it is necessary to safeguard patient confidentiality, including several aspects, such as physical, informational, decisional, and associational privacy. At the same time, it is obligatory to keep the records of all the patients in the healthcare settings while Dr. W was asked not to maintain them to avoid possible arrest of these women. Thus, the doctor understood that in another case, the employees of this firm would not have a chance for diligent healthcare and, moreover, could possibly spread the STIs further. The case engages issues in several fields, such as criminal law, ethical concerns, human rights, and service provider regulations. From the side of conspiracy law, it is possible to assume that the agreement of Dr. W is equal to the participation in the crime. As she is aware of the crime and did not report it but helped in its realization, the court’s decision can be not in her favor. From the point of view of human rights, prostitution is illegal in the US. Even more, if the minors are employed in the firm, the case falls under the mandatory reported law (Todres, 2016). Ethical considerations here also imply helping a child by breaching confidentiality. To conclude, the decision in the case of an encounter with human trafficking should be equivocal. By facilitating the activity of an enterprise engaged with human trafficking, a physician is partly responsible for the crimes and exploitation of women and children. Therefore, following the legal frameworks and ethical considerations, such cases should be reported.",
    "Feminist ethics is founded on the views that women’s subordination is morally inappropriate and that women’s moral experiences are as valuable as men’s. Vaughn (2019) states that the following are the practical aims of feminist ethics. Firstly, feminist ethics express moral critiques of behaviors and attitudes that reinforce women’s rights. Consequently, the vital goal is to provide morally reasonable means to oppose such behaviors and practices. Ultimately, feminist ethics’ objective is to imagine a morally good alternative that promotes female empowerment. Feminist ethical argument resurfaced in the late 1960s, first among the general public and then in academic discourse, as part of a broader rebirth of feminist ethical questions. On issues like abortion, fairness and equality, domestic work, sexual violence, and obligatory heterosexuality, the first academic feminist ideas were expressed. Nonetheless, the term ‘feminist ethics’ did not become widely used until the late 1970s or early 1980s (Vaughn, 2019). Traditional ethics, feminists speculated, was more thoroughly male-biased and required more radical reconsideration. Moreover, feminism is continuously engaged in ethical thought and discussion. According to Vaughn (2019), feminism is primarily a normative viewpoint, and feminists themselves regularly challenge its meaning. Lack of care for women’s interests, disregard for women’s concerns, rejection of women’s moral agency, devaluation of feminine ideals, and depreciation of women’s experience are all manifestations of feminist obstacles. Putting women’s interests first, considering women as ethical experts or authorities, exchanging male for female values, or extrapolating directly from women’s moral experience are all illustrations of how feminist ethics has been stereotyped and viewed. Essentially, these stereotypes are widespread and inaccurate; feminist ethics is significantly more extensive and more open than the misinterpretations suggest. To summarize, modern feminists are experimenting with new methods of thinking about moral themes that are attentive to their specific particularity and inherent shared worth, such as shared humanity, fairness, and impartiality.",
    "The concepts of domestic violence and abuse refer to psychologically or physically aggressive behavior of one family member towards another. This aggression could take the form of beating, rape, screaming, and humiliation. Unfortunately, in the modern world, these are common phenomena. According to statics provided by Huecker et al. (2021), 10 million Americans per year suffer from violence and abuse. The victims of domestic violence and abuse feel depressed and helpless, and their self-esteem is also extremely low. Fear of the aggressor might force a victim to keep calm about the experience of being abused. Nonetheless, there are signs via which a provider could suspect domestic violence, child abuse, or elder abuse. If a woman arrives at the emergency room with bruises or fractures that do not as she slipped on the wet floor, a nurse could suspect that her partner beats her. In addition to that, victims are highly likely to be depressed and anxious even though they might try to hide these emotions (Lloyd, 2018). A provider has a reason to be concerned with child abuse if a young patient is underweighted without objective reason and is afraid of other adults. In addition to that, a child might get severely scared with a loud sound or sudden movement. As for older adults, a nurse could suspect abuse if they have bruises, broken glasses, or walking stick, show signs of depression, and fails to take medications properly. Another warning sign is the refusal of a caregiver to leave an older person alone with a nurse. Undoubtedly, caregivers might not be willing to leave in some cases because they worry about missing information on an older adults health. However, a strict refusal to follow the requests of the medical staff and negotiate is a bad sign. In every health facility, a nurse who notices the signs of abuse and domestic violence must report them to the relevant authorities. More precisely, in the case of child abuse, medical staff contacts social services via hotlines or a written statement. The fact of elder abuse should be reported to the agencies on adult protective services. Finally, a nurse should inform the local law enforcement of the case of domestic violence. Still, before informing the related agencies, a nurse should discuss the case with a physician or a nurse practitioner and exam the patient without the potential abuser in the room.",
    "Introduction The fashion industry is one of the most dynamic sectors around the globe, and the dynamism arises from the diverse needs of the client base. Fashion is a personal statement and a symbol of societal status that also defines a person’s culture and individuality. As a result, clients are always curious about fashionable pieces that serve several factors while maintaining a particular budget. Although many clothes stores stock a variety of fashionable clothes, they do not capture the clients’ personality and individual needs because the designs are premade. Most stores such as Zara and H&M invest significant funds into identifying the unique needs of their clients. However, their reach in identifying these needs is not yet global, and this implies that a significant section of the target market buys what is available. Therefore, bridging the gap between what the clients want from their preferred clothes stores and what the stores are offering is crucial in promoting customer satisfaction. Our project, Be-Unique , intends to solve this problem by leveraging technology to bring the services closer to the clients. The purpose of the project is to provide a highly integrative platform through which customers can digitally access their favorite clothing stores. The platform intends to revolutionize the fashion industry by offering clients an opportunity to present their unique designs for customization. Online clothes from stores such as Zara and H&M are made using standard sizes that may not fit all body sizes within the standard measurements. Our online stores’ mandate is to ensure that clients have easy access to thigh-quality fashionable items that can be customized to fit their unique sizes. Therefore, our mandate will include offering the clients an opportunity to submit their sizes to our platform, whereby their clothes can be tailor-made to fit their unique sizes. Our highly skilled team will be on standby to take clients’ measurements and submit them to the famous clothes stores for customization.",
    "The editing in the first episode of the series Money Heist is in line with its thrilling plot and rapid action. In the first scene, as the character gets ready to exit her vehicle, the editing is quick, focusing on the items she is picking up. Similarly, the camera often focuses on objects, leading the viewer towards the items that will become an essential part of the narrative. For example, one can see the ringing phone before it is picked up. Moreover, the show uses rapid editing with close-ups and the use of objects that identify characters – guns, money, and other items that show one’s motives or their identifying trait. The characters’ close-ups are dynamic, often using dolly shots to slowly expose the background or move with the character. This way, the camera does not stop as long as the characters move or the whole room is exposed. When they stop, the editing is as rapid as the conversation between people. In monologues, the dolly is used again to keep the tension as the series requires a serious tone in many scenes dealing with life-or-death scenarios. Notably, the character in a close-up is rarely placed in the center of the screen. The shot is divided into thirds vertically – and the characters stay in the first or third part. Hand-held shots are also used, and they are consistent with scenes where characters feel insecure, aggressive, scared, or exposed. Moreover, when the characters are walking, the camera moves at the same speed. The change between steady dolly movements and hand-held “shaky” shots is needed to juxtapose moments focused on action and interpersonal drama. Moreover, tension is the primary source of emotion, and the editing keeps enough suspense by using close-ups of characters rather than an overview of the whole room.",
    "The Supreme Court ruled that Static Control’s claim of violation of the Lanham Act clause falsifying advertisement was valid. The underlying issue in the case was that the Supreme Court had to determine the meaning of the provision by applying the traditional principles of interpreting the statute (Campbell, 2020). The second issue is that labeling the claim by Static Control as a prudential standing question was misleading (Halbert & Ingulli, 2020). Lexmark bases the arguments on the prudential standing of Associated General Contractors. However, the case has strong grounds on statutory provisions that the Supreme Court had to ascertain in terms of statutory interpretation. The causes of the statute violations damage the plaintiff’s reputation since they fall within the zone of interest covered by the statute. The Supreme Court presumed that the statutory cause of action extended only to plaintiffs for whom the invoked law protects their interests. According to Bennett v. Spear, 520 U. S. 154, the span of the zone of interest varies depending on the law at issue (Tavares, 2021). The Lanham Act includes statements of purposes such as the people engaged and protection against unfair competition. Common law depicts unfair competition as causing injury to a business’s reputation or sales. The plaintiff must then show that they suffered a commercial interest injury within the zone of interest in a false-advertising suit. The Supreme Court also presumed that the statutory cause of action is limited to the plaintiff whose injuries arise from the proximate cause of the violation of the statute. For example, in the case of Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corporation, 503 U.S. 258-270, the statutory cause of action bars suits from damages that are remote from the defendant’s unlawful conduct (Jones, 2019). However, since the Lanham Act only allows commercial injury lawsuits, the proximate cause of the consumer deception is not fatal as required by the statute. The principles act as guidance than the direct-competitor test, reasonable interest by the Sixth Circuit, or multifactor balancing test recommended by Lexmark. The principle also outlines that the claims by Static Control fall under plaintiffs authorized to sue under §1125(a). Static Control can sufficiently allege that it lost sales and suffered injuries in its business reputation within the zone of interest caused by Lexmark’s misrepresentation.",
    "Marketing is one of the most critical aspects of every business, which makes organizations look for effective ways to attract new customers. However, not all marketing activities are fair or ethical, and targeting uninformed consumers is among them. One should explain that uninformed consumers are individuals who lack the psychological or mental maturity to make reasonable decisions and purchases. Examples of these people are children, the elderly, and individuals with psychological conditions. Consequently, it is unethical to target such consumers because this practice can provide these people with adverse outcomes. Many factors explain why it is unethical to target uninformed consumers. The first robust argument comes from the definition presented above. Since these people do not have psychological or mental maturity, target marketing can force them to purchase unneeded items. Consequently, this marketing approach is a form of manipulation of unprotected populations. The second reason refers to the fact that it is challenging for uninformed consumers to locate sellers’ lying. As a result, organizations can provide customers with false information to stimulate their buying behaviors. Irrespective of this information, some people claim that there is nothing wrong with targeting uninformed consumers. This point of view relies on the belief that such customers represent new markets, and organizations are free to enter and benefit from them. However, it is challenging to deny that these consumers are vulnerable populations, meaning that they deserve a specific attitude. That is why it is unethical to target uninformed customers. In conclusion, the essay has presented robust arguments of why organizations should refrain from targeting children, the elderly, and people with mental conditions. Even though some people and businesses stipulate that these populations are suitable for marketing, it is better to avoid them. The rationale behind this statement is that uninformed consumers do not have psychological maturity, meaning that target marketing can force them to make unreasonable decisions and purchases.",
    "The European powers had taken major parts of the world, including the Caribbean. In the 15 th century, the Europeans claimed the region following the establishment of Spanish settlements and conquest of the Aztec and Inca empires (Horne, 2018). Due to the conquest, it was easy for the Spanish to invade Mexico and Peru through exploration in strategic points of the Caribbean region. Following the Spanish invasion of the Caribbean in the 17th century, other European powers such as the British and French started settling in pivotal points such as the island of Tortuga and later moved to Jamaica (Horne, 2018). By mid-century, many non-Hispanic privateers had established permanent colonies and trading zones in Caribbean islands. The profitability in terms of wealth enabled rise of conquest to Caribbean region. First, it was easy to obtain gold, which was among the region’s key aspects of the scramble. The existence of Christopher Columbus in the region had shown the way for other leaders to set colonies (Horne, 2018). Second, there was the availability of a labor force drawn from the African continent as black people were used as slaves to work in the industrial openings in the area. Due to the decline of Spanish power in the region, majorly as a result of reduced native population of the area, the other European powers boosted their presence in areas that Columbus had covered. For example, Francis Drake, a privateer from England, attacked many Spanish settlements (Horne, 2018). The collaborative base between the French, British and Dutch made it possible for European powers to conquer the significant area of the Caribbean. After start of the competitive nature of colonies, sovereign battles emerged that led to stiff wars that made it hard for the Caribbean islands to unite against European rule (Horne, 2018). Because of the emergence of agricultural activities, the Atlantic slave trade saw many Africans work for the Europeans in the Caribbean, strengthening their colonialism in the area hence conquering the region significantly.",
    "Introduction Back to the Future is a unique film of its time, which has become a cult film thanks to its gripping plot and attention to detail. Screenwriter Robert Zemeckis created a movie about travel, pitting opposing personalities against each other who later became perfect partners. Thesis: Robert Zemeckis created an award-winning film that changed views on cause and effect and interactions through plot structure, character development, and setting. Body Paragraphs   * The plot structure of Back to the Future keeps the viewer interested in the film through logical cause-and-effect relationships.       + Each moment in the film is connected to the last moment and the next, weaving them into a unified structure.       + The scene begins with a ticking clock, then shifts to the theft of the plutonium and a focus on Marty, who is unaware of what was stolen under his bed.       + Marty ignores the safety of the clock tower, but later it turns out that he was around when the tower stopped.   * Character development in the story is built on the opposites of Marty and Doc, who elusively turn out to be people with similar histories.       + Marty is relatively quick and restless, though Doc seems judicious and prone to over-analyzing the situation: together, their work is coherent and efficient.       + Marty uses teenage slang while Doc uses proper speech: their different characters allow them to see the best in each other and develop as individuals.   * The film’s setting is new and unusual for the time of its creation, so the viewer’s eye is drawn to the screenwriter’s love of detail and desire to fill the film with characters from different eras.       + The differences in road construction quickly determine the time difference: in the ’50s, some were dirt roads.       + The film revisits the clock tower, which was in operation in the ’50s and stopped in the ’80s. Conclusion Back to the Future reveals to the viewer a new reality in which everything is interconnected: logical connections, people, and places. Zemeckis has created a unique story that amazes audiences with its details, developments, and shifting eras.",
    "The study showed that bibliometric analysis of evidence gathered from integrative reviews and analytical studies had substantial implications for nurse-related and evidence based policy changes. Primarily, this is possible through the use of integrative reviews in designing new programs (Benton et al., 2020). The collective database of the synthesized studies as suggested by the authors of the study, can be utilized by nurses to be empowered through evidence-based materials in the formulation of changes in universal health coverage. As such, the applicability of this information has a number of benefits for working nurses, as they will be able to employ concise and trusted resources when advocating or implementing changes to policy. I think that nursing practice can be vastly improved with the use of well-managed databases that employ evidence-based research. This is because such a database will be able to illustrate gaps in knowledge of overarching issues as well as daily medical practices in the sphere of nursing (Houser, 2016). Similarly, it allows for insight into nurse-specific fields such as nurse education, care for the lederly, emergency care, and more. Currently, accessibility to extensive and complete information that is formed through evidence-based research is limited due to a number of factors. In order to better provide such informative materials among working nurses it is essential to reduce bureaucratic processes and integrate technology into the process. Modern technology allows for low-cost and time-saving methods of information sharing, which will be largely beneficial for nursing. As mentioned prior, evidence-based research has the potential to reveal gaps in information in nurse-specific practices that would otherwise be unseen. I believe it is essential to make such knowledge accesibile and cohesive to promote better nursing care and work quality.",

    "It is a film about the fragility of masculinity, men’s mental health, and how they are interconnected. Fight Club is a crude portrait of what happens when men’s insecurities turn into masculinity in overdrive. Thus, this film represents toxic masculinity. Fight Club shows men dissatisfied with the state of masculinity. The characters are different in that many of them were raised by their mothers because their fathers either left the family or got divorced. According to Ta, the result is that the characters see themselves as “a generation of men raised by women” (270). In their life there is not enough male education for the formation of their masculinity. It confirms the idea of phallocentrism, which is based on the image of castrated women. Women raise children so that they can enter into the symbolic order. Fight Club is a wicked satire about finding, nurturing, and destroying yourself. It challenges ideas of masculinity, adding to the image of a real man several features that can be called associative and setting self-destruction and a destructive impact on society as one of life’s goals. The victory of Jack’s subpersonality over Tyler on the roof of a skyscraper shows that the good in a real man can overcome the destructive element. The ability to self-sacrifice and responsibility for his actions in Jack, who has gone through the evolution of masculinity, inspires some optimism, but the finale remains open.",
    "In the development of nursing in Europe in the 19th century, the activities of an outstanding personality, the Englishwoman Florence Nightingale, played an important role. Florence was looking for an opportunity to help the poor and the sick. At that distant time, activities related to mercy, helping those in need, were considered an occupation not worthy of a noblewoman. The young woman sacrificed personal life expensive relationships with her parents but remained faithful to her calling. Furthermore, her values and commitment allowed Florence to become a historical figure in modern nursing, to whose leadership people owe accolades for paving the way of nursing’s place in our societies. Thanks to perseverance and perseverance, in 1851, Florence entered the community of the sisters of pastor F. Flender in Germany, where she received a nursing education. Subsequently, Florence made a considerable contribution not only to the treatment of cholera help in wars but to the development of leadership and the reformation of nursing (Kim, 2020) The selfless woman became an example of service to people and a prototype of international mercy. Moreover, Florence managed to change a common thought about nobility of nursing, her leadership allowed to reestablish pivotal understanding of nursing practice. Her significance can easily be depicted on a medal with her image, which is awarded for special merits to distinguished nurses. A large role in the development of nursing abroad belongs to the international society of the Red Cross. The International Committee for Relief of the Wounded, headed by A. Dunant, convened a conference in Geneva in October 1863 with the participation of representatives of 13 countries, at which the charter of the International Organization of the Red Cross was developed, and the emblem of the society was adopted. The United States achieved tremendous success in the development of nursing in the 19th-20th centuries, when the American Medical Association was first established. (AMA) (Kim, 2020) In 1873, the first three nursing schools were opened in the USA according to the model of the F. Nightingale schools in London (Kim, 2020) Thus, the further formation of international humanitarian organizations was also primarily made possible by leaders such as Florence.",
    "Diana Kendall claims the current perception of the class has been a construct of the media and based on the construction, the meaning of class is determined. Kendall argues that the media has legitimized inequality in the United States through the assumption, with television programs and newspaper articles creating and reifying class-based stereotypes. Furthermore, Kendall argues that class discussions in the media are rarely explicit; however, their portrayals generate perspectives that impact human behavior. The upper class in society is portrayed positively, while the lower class is framed negatively. On the one hand, the upper class contains individuals that should be emulated, comprised of caring and generous people, and those with criminal records have remarkably good lives (Kendall 10). On the other hand, the lower class is framed as homeless, poor, largely ignored by the media, and often discussed as abstract statistics. As such, when casting a human face, the demographics of the poor determine how they are framed. The quality of life may deteriorate from the understanding that as the media focuses on the upper class’s viewpoints and gives voice to their concerns, it neglects the concerns of lower-class members. The conveyed class discourses by the media, including constructions of the homeless and the poor, portrays a lifestyle inflicted by laziness, diseases, crime, and substance abuse (Kendall 94). The dehumanized statistics associated with personalized suffering portray people detached from the broader contributing factors like unemployment, ignorance, laziness, or otherwise responsible people for their misfortunes (Kendall 94). Therefore, courtesy of the detachment, the life quality of the low-class individuals continues to deteriorate since the uneducated and the poor’s needs are overlooked. With attention given to upper-class individuals, the needs of the poor are not voiced; therefore, their lives continue to be exposed to deterioration risks.",
    "Although the Monster can be considered a bad character due to murdering people, the creature has good traits as well. The Monster is described as ugly and strong but at the same time, inexperienced. Firstly, Frankenstein’s creature is described as “its gigantic structure and the deformity of its aspect … instantly informed me that it was the wretch” (Shelley). Despite his ugly and terrifying appearance, the subject did not have the intention to kill people. The creature can be compared to a baby who tries to examine the world it lives in, and its actions are just contractions to the cruelty of the world. Frankenstein’s monster is not a real monster; it just seeks love and attention that the world cannot give him. The creature’s emotionalism is a positive feature as it allows it to understand people’s feelings and share them. The “Gothic” elements of the novel include supernatural motives, the architecture from the Middle Ages, and the spiritual aspects of human nature. Other “Gothic” elements consist of the strive for knowledge, the Monster, and the probable moral fall of men. I like that genre because I like looking at diverse issues from various perspectives. This novel allows me to look at the actions of Victor Frankenstein and the Monster and understand their motives and feelings. I also appreciate novels that aim to show moral aspects of society with the utilization of different symbols, such as the Monster. Mary Shelley’s husband believed that inappropriate social relationships are the result of people becoming evil. To make people bad, other representatives of society should reject them and make them feel useless or bad. I agree with this opinion, as people’s intentions are generally based on their experience of social interactions. If society treats people as if they were misconducts, there is no reason to try to be good or fit in. I believe that one of the integral themes of the novel is loneliness. The Monster aimed to integrate into society; however, people met him with disgust, fear, hatred, and all the spectrum of negative emotions. Hence, the creature turned to evil because of the feeling of loneliness. Nowadays, society often tries to isolate individuals who do not view the world the same as most people do. This feature often leads to the feeling of being lost and lonely.",
    "The concept of “gender roles” is often applied to the analysis and comprehension of writings from various historical periods. These responsibilities appear to have been firmly defined during the Anglo-Saxon period. The poem Beowulf belongs to the epic or heroic poetry genre, which has poems that commemorate the characters’ brave and martial actions. Women are portrayed as belongings for the advantage of the men throughout Beowulf and are made to support the male characters. In addition, women are utilized as plot devices to advance the story tale of men. Women, on the other hand, are a minor character in the plot, their presence being overshadowed by the men. The queen of the Swedes was given no name, her identity being secondary to her status as the king’s wife, Onela. The males, such as Hrothgar, Beowulf, Wiglaf, and Unferth, occupied the majority of the storyline of the poem. As a result, mentions of women are few and far between in comparison. “…the Helming woman went on her rounds…treating the family and the collected troop,” the poem says of a woman who fulfills traditional gender responsibilities as a character Beowulf (Heaney 620). The passage represents the expectation of women in the eleventh century, that they should look after males and be gentle. Queen Modthryth was presented later in the tale as the antithesis to Queen Hygd, who was autonomous and despised by men. “Even a queen of great beauty must not overstep like that,” they said dismissively. (Beowulf 1940-1941), until she married Offa, who rewarded her for her self-control. Queen Modthryth was only considered acceptable by society once she married, implying that women had less value unless they were married.",
    "Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) have become a part of all humans’ lives, but they remain a debatable issue thus far. Some people argue that it is not ethical to change any genetic information and play God (MacKinnon & Fiala, 2017). However, I believe that GMOs are only another advancement in people’s lives as the creation of machines, cars, or spaceships. GMOs (be it a plant or animal) are a part of my life as well, as I have consumed GMO-based products. I am not concerned about long-term effects as much as some of my peers since I find GMOs to be a product of selection that has been in place for centuries. People have noticed some properties they considered to be appropriate for them and tried to grow as many plants and animals that have certain qualities as possible. I would use the principles of utilitarianism to support my claim. This theory is based on the view that everything is ethical if it contributes to as much good for as many people as possible. GMOs can help people overcome one of the major problems that is famine. GMOs are resistant to harsh environmental conditions, so people may grow more crops and other important plants. Millions of people still starve and are in need of food, so the production of more food is beneficial for all. Of course, some use the deontological approach and state that it is simply wrong to interfere with genetic codes as it is the divine domain. GMOs are seen as people’s attempts to play God, which is morally wrong. However, I would stress that even according to the Bible, humans were given the planet to take care of it, so using innovative tools is another way to follow the Christian postulates and take care of all creatures.",
    "The issue of the internationalization of companies is a phenomenon that has consistently attracted the attention of researchers in the field of management. In the last decade, the focus has shifted from considering the benefits and risks of internationalization to studying the strategies of international companies operating and developing. However, it should be remembered that globalization acts as a kind of institutional environment for global companies, characterized by high uncertainty and risks and a non-monotonous, dynamic nature. The main incentive for the globalization and internationalization of the company is a significant expansion of market opportunities, both production, and trade. This is also connected with the benefits gained from implementing an international strategy, namely the growth of the company’s market, economies of scale and learning, and, of course, the advantages of new locations. Many companies from developing countries such as China, India, and Taiwan are active in global value chains in high-tech sectors of the economy (Stallkamp & Schotter, 2019). However, this fact leads to the fact that there is the broadest range of problems inherent in international companies in these countries. For example, emerging markets often have inadequate government oversight and regulation levels, leading to global companies’ unethical and criminal trading practices. For example, a typical example of this is the exploitation of cheap local labor to make production more affordable for international businesses (Mashan, 2021). This is morally and ethically appalling in the extreme but will have dire consequences for the company in the future. Given the benefits of international diversification, some firms choose not to expand internationally for several reasons. The most common of these is the reluctance to go beyond the domestic market of their homeland (Paul & Mas, 2019). This suggests either an unwillingness to face the risks of globalization or an initial calculation of opportunities, taking into account only the company’s home market factors. Moreover, an important reason for the rejection of globalization may be the awareness of problems faced with a foreign market, its characteristics, and potential consumers’ culture, religion, and customs. Thus, the global strategy has its colossal advantages and disadvantages that can push the company away from this approach.",
    "Gnomial Functions Inc. wants to determine the most reliable forecasting technique for determining the sales level for the next eighteen months. The sales trend reflected a consistent increase over the last 18 months with minimal seasonal variation. However, the sales for recent months reflected had more significance on the following months sales (Wisniewski, 2016). Consequently, Gnomial Functions Inc. should use the weighted moving average to forecast the most likely level of sales. The weighted moving average used four weights to determine the likely level of sales in the next month. These weights ranged from 0.1 to 0.4 for the earliest and most recent months respectively. The most recent data received a higher weight due to its higher relevance to the future level of sales. Consequently, the weighted moving average generates accurate forecast compared to the simple moving averages. The company can realize even more accurate forecast by adjusting the weights for the moving average. The management should give higher weight to the recent monthly sales to reduce the forecasting error. Specifically, the mean absolute deviation and mean standard error for the initial weights (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4) was 6.27 and 47.29. In contrast, when the new weights that give more importance to the recent performance (0, 0, 0.4, and 0.6) are applied, the mean absolute deviation declined to 4.81, and the mean standard error declines to 27.28. This performance is better than the simple moving average. Gnomial Functions Inc. should use the weighted moving average to determine the likely level of sales in the next year. This method is simple, effective, and reliable. In addition, it can be adjusted to reflect the changes in sales trend by adjusting the weights to give the requisite importance to the recent months. Therefore, the company should use weighted moving average to estimate the likely performance in the coming year.",
    "The modern world economy is so diverse and deep that it is very difficult to predict for sure when a crisis will break. Recession is danger, and danger is stress – in such a situation, the brain begins to rely on basic instincts of protection – to run, hide, survive. Crisis intervention is a relatively new discipline, the main task of which is to provide temporary emergency emotional assistance to victims of mental and physical violence (Colford & Cavaiola, 2017). Nowadays, there is a risk of economic decline which can seriously affect the entire population; hence, I would not like to experience recession since it would significantly affect my life. The crisis is a phenomenon that takes a toll primarily on the individuals who work for non-profit organizations. There is an increase in layoffs, which means many people will have live on the state allowance. The inability to find a job is the next cause of the crisis. What is more, the level of poverty will raise making people abandon their homes. Individuals will not be able to afford necessary items as well as paying rent. Hence, I consider a recession as an undesirable event for myself due to its damaging nature. When considering the crisis from a professional point of view, the crisis affects the national economy as a whole, affecting not individual enterprises, but the entire sector of the economy. There is an increase in the cost of credit resources and the difficulty of attracting them. In addition, there is a threat of deterioration of relations with international partner organizations. In general, the crisis is an undesirable phenomenon due to its devastating effects and unpredictable consequences.",
    "The YouTube video published by GP Synergy, “GP Training in Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services,” sends a message that Aboriginal Medical Services play a crucial role within the diverse community. The services are essential for providing culturally sensitive and high-quality care to the target populations, often marginalized and underserved, ensuring they have everything they need to tackle rising health concerns. The comprehensive set of services provided by the medical facilities ensures that the patients from the Aboriginal community have access to affordable and convenient health care. One service can support multiple aspects of clients’ lives. The comprehensive approach toward culturally-sensitive care is especially relevant in addressing the social determinants of health (SHOD), which encompass multiple areas of the population’s health, well-being, and quality of life. SDOH includes safe housing, neighborhoods, convenient transportation, racial discrimination and violence, education, income, job opportunities, access to nutritional foods, low-quality air and water, and language and literacy skills (Healthy People 2030, 2020). Therefore, the Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services aims to address the health disparities and inequities that most Aboriginal patients encounter (Pearson et al., 2020). The professionals working within the Aboriginal Community Health Services framework underline the importance of patient education to ensure that the population is aware of its potential health challenges and knows about the necessity of early prevention and management. The prominent SHOD that is being discussed in the “GP Training in Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services” video is discrimination. The health center workers acknowledge that many of their patients have experienced discrimination in the healthcare system and want to receive culturally-sensitive services (Kim, 2019). Providing such services is challenging because healthcare workers do not know what to expect from each patient and must be prepared to carry out culturally sensitive services (Jongen, McCalman, and Bainbridge, 2018). Care continuity is especially relevant in this case because when patients feel that they are being discriminated against or misunderstood, they are less likely to return to their providers to continue treatment or screening for their core health concerns. Even though implementing culturally sensitive care and addressing the SHOD of discrimination is challenging for providers, it is also highly rewarding. The patients discriminated against want to feel accepted, understood, and cared for. Because of this, the workers of the Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services institutions always prioritize building meaningful relationships with their patients (Luft, 2017). Besides, the professionals have noted that they have taken the role of advocates who support their patients in terms of healthcare services and their acceptance in their immediate community and the larger society. Therefore, the work of Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services professionals entails consistent collaboration between themselves and their patients who feel underserved and misunderstood. To conclude, addressing the social determinants of health that affects the Aboriginal community is a demanding process that requires dedication and focuses on the unique needs of patients coming to a facility to receive culturally-sensitive care. Undoubtedly, the process will take some time because healthcare providers must be well-prepared and well-versed in the social determinants of health affecting their clients.",
    "The cultural effects of Roman dominance over the Greek-speaking regions is a fascinating topic that has attracted great scientific interest, especially in the last couple of years. The impact of the interaction between two cultures varied in time and space and was definitely more prominent in places where Roman communities had emerged. These communities served as the so-called influence vectors, and their long residing alongside Greeks resulted in the transmission of Roman elements into public life. One of such elements was Roman names, the dissemination of which may be explained by the existence of networks of exchange and the sense of identity of name bearers. Rizakis (2019) notes that the introduction of the Greeks to the Roman system of naming with its further adaptation to their norms and the Roman names adoption by peregrine Greeks are two different phenomena. However, they both are examples of the interaction process between the two traditions, which gradually led to the appearance of a common onomastic culture. This acculturation form, increased in the 2 nd century AD, showed wide regional variability, and the reception of it was different in different cities and social classes. These cultural transfers were mostly mediated by civic elites, as their purpose was to pass on their influence by name – both in a regional context and more broadly, on a system level. Tria nomina, in particular, and its use in the imperial period especially, as stated by Rizakis (2019), was a source of pride, power, and prestige. Due to this, some names became popular as expressions of the shared culture and were accepted and adopted, albeit on a small scale, by the lower classes as well, having lost their original meaning. However, the dominance of Roman names as the distinguishing signs of the Empire’s free citizens took place for a short amount of time. As per Rizakis (2019), by the end of the 3 rd century AD, a new way of identity expression appeared – a single naming system using separate Greek and Roman names. At first it was used sparingly but after the reign of Constantine – and especially during the period of late antiquity – it started being employed in almost all Roman provinces. This change, advanced by Christianity’s progress and the Roman Empire’s decline, might be deemed as a return to the Greek naming tradition.",
    "Health promoters are a trained workforce whose primary purpose is to improve health through a variety of activities carried out by health promotion organizations. Individual empowerment, societal responsibility for health, and establishing an enabling environment for developing personal skills and boosting community action are among their top goals (Nutbeam, 2019). In the realm of health promotion, experts from various multidisciplinary health workers have agreed on the characteristics of effective collaboration and an interdisciplinary approach. Interdisciplinary teams’ most essential purpose is to bring together a variety of diverse viewpoints on caring and to use the talents and knowledge of many different individuals and sectors. Intersectional collaboration between different health professionals and the public and commercial sectors is critical for effective health promotion (US Department of Health and Human Services, 2018). The diversity of these elements demonstrates that one’s health is not just dependent on medical services or nurses and physicians (Nutbeam, 2019). The large range of activities that make up health promotion needs a diverse set of abilities from a number of health professionals and industries. Incorporating multidisciplinary specialists within the health promotion team, such as Nurse Practitioners (NPs), Social Workers (SWs), and Registered Nurses (RNs), will be advantageous in the long and short term. Nurse practitioners are nurses who receive further education and training and are capable of treating a wide range of ailments as well as providing preventative care and health education (Pun, 2018). Social workers have specialized training in assisting people and groups in developing skills and resolving difficulties. Whether the issues are personal, interpersonal, or social in nature, social workers can assist in guiding and resolving many of today’s issues (Nutbeam, 2019). Registered nurses examine and analyze healthcare needs in order to decide the best service or treatment, the best healthcare provider, and the best equipment to deliver patient care (Pun, 2018). Thus, their skills and approach will be essential in the success of an interdisciplinary team tasked with health promotion.",
    "Like many other areas of life, music has changed along with society. The period between 1959 and 1963 was transitional, and at least two distinct markets emerged in the music industry (Covach and Flory 112). The first one was defined by the new generation of teenagers who favored dance music (Covach and Flory 113). The second market consisted of former rock and rollers who preferred folk music associated with social, political, and economic issues (Covach and Flory 113). Folk had a long history of addressing problems within American society, and its music appeared to be more dedicated to the community than commercial pop (Covach and Flory 118-119). Folk performers appealed to the audience and represented people rather than being above them (Covach and Flory 119). Almost anyone could play folk, as the music was simple and required a few easy guitar accords (Covach and Flory 119). Thus, the idea spread of folk being “for the people and by the people” (Covach and Flory 119-120). The concept was related to the music and the people’s ideologies, as the singers and the audience, united by social issues, expressed their concerns through songs. As folk was the music of people, it was also a movement characterized by many important figures. The Weavers consisted of traditional performers such as Peete Seeger and were one of the most significant folk groups in the US (Covach and Flory 119). The Weavers focused on societal problems and prioritized the simplicity of the music, gaining an audience among college students (Covach and Flory 119). At the beginning of the 1960s, The Kingston Trio was the most popular group that started the folk revival in the mainstream pop market (Covach and Flory 119-120). The Kingston Trio’s pop-sensitive approach was favored by the public and defined folk music for many general listeners (Covach and Flory 120-121). Considerable singers have represented folk music, supporting the movement of addressing issues within society.",
    "The Roman Empire was largely polytheistic, suggesting that people acknowledged and honored several different gods. They thought that these entities had a part in the formation of Roman civilization and shaped the events of people’s everyday lives (Bartsch, 2020). Because of Rome’s geographical location, its population had regular interaction with Greek peoples who had expanded their territory into the Italian peninsula and Sicily (Beard, 2015). Many features of Greek culture were borrowed by Rome, with minor modifications to fit their requirements. According to Polybius ‘ interpretation of the Roman government, the monarchy was solidified in the office of the Consul. The tales of Manilus Hippomanes, Olivier de Noyen, and Julien Barneuve are connected through history in The Dream of Scipio by a philosophical musing claiming that man is accountable for his action’s own redemption, but only by understanding, not by works or faith (Ruden, 2013). Rome had two chancellors, each in control of divisions of the Roman army and had the authority to convene conferences and present different initiatives before the Senate; they were acclaimed yearly. Citizenship in Rome was a complicated notion that differed depending on one’s gender, family, and status in society. Males were the only ones who could acquire full citizenship. A kid born of a legal union between a citizen father and a citizen mother would be granted citizenship by descent (Beard, 2015). Citizenship in the United States can be obtained by birth or registration. People are generally born U.S. citizens if they are born in America or are born overseas to U.S. citizens. They may also obtain U.S. nationality as a youngster as a result of the marriage of one or both adults.",
    "A proposed financial plan to support Mental Health Services for Healthcare Providers of Critical Patients: Category Subcategory Expenditures ($) Staff Mental Health Service Manager 400,000 Personal Consultants 840,000 Group Consultants 650,000 Technical Support Staff 180,000 Equipment Personal Laptops 12,000 Personal Mobile Phones 5,000 Services Telephone Service 2,400 Internet Service 300 Supplies Administrative Supplies 500 Medication 1,500 Training Employee Training 2,000 Managerial Training 2,000 Maintenance Offices Maintenance 3,000 Laptops and Mobile Phones Maintenance 1,500 Other Expenditures Unforeseen Expenditures 5,000 The impact of a biblical stewardship perspective on the proposed financial plan The biblical perspective on stewardship presumes that leaders are granted control over other people and resources by God (Carradus, Zozimo, & Discua Cruz, 2020). Thus, they should strive to ensure the well-being of every person in order to honor the Lord. In this regard, the current financial plan was designed in a manner that would benefit all the stakeholders involved, including healthcare providers of critical patients and consulting staff. The potential holes and unknowns in the project’s financial plan Although the financial plan seemingly addresses most of the expenses that may occur during the project realization, there are still some unknowns that should be considered. As such, O’Connell (2020) argues that managers should always think about the worst-case scenario and be prepared to respond adequately. In the case of the current project, first of all, it is hard to predict the real demand for mental health services among doctors. This, in turn, negatively affects the ability to predict the required number of mental health workers. Secondly, potential crises and resulting inflation rates may cause a price increase, which, in turn, would necessitate additional money to purchase equipment and medication. Moreover, the costs for the services, training, and maintenance may also surge. Assumptions that can fill the potential holes in the project’s financial plan As for the former hole in the financial plan, it can be assumed that there will be an average demand for mental services among healthcare professionals. This assumption would help to partly mitigate the risks of the unknown need for offered services. It is explained by the fact that when the expected demand is low but the actual necessity is high, then the patients are largely underserved. On the contrary, when expectations are high, but the actual demand is low, it leads to substantial financial losses. As for inflation, it is necessary to assume a certain amount of money for unforeseen expenditures. Therefore, if the prices rise, the organization will still be able to pay for the planned expenses.",
    "In the article “The influence of peers during adolescence: Does homophobic name-calling by peers change gender identity?” the authors claim that negative name-calling among peers can lead to a change in gender identity. Firstly, this is because negative experiences with peers of the same sex result in the need to identify with peers of the opposite sex. Secondly, during the period of growing up, the adolescents’ identity is not yet fully established. Therefore, they are constantly re-evaluating whether the identity formation is going in the right direction. DeLay et al. (2018) recognize that homophobia can be directed at homosexual and heterosexual adolescents. This is presumably because the purpose of victimization is to hurt someone’s feelings, not point out real flaws. Gender identity development is a critical stage in developing a personality occurring during adolescence (DeLay et al., 2018). Since homophobic name-calling is a form of victimization, this practice should be frowned upon or banned in schools. Ioverno et al. (2021) note that “bullying GNCV may represent a defensive reaction to demonstrate bullies’ gender conformity” (p. 215). Therefore, work with bullies should be carried out competently and with the participation of a psychologist. Interestingly, Ioverno et al. (2021) highlight how this statement is especially true for male bullies. That is because their “own gender conformity can affect the selection of victims based on their gender conformity” (p. 216). It is critical to understand this mirror interaction to resolve the issues of gender victimization. Equally important, victimization of adolescents, including LGB, trans, and heterosexual high school students may lead to “anxiety, depression, and substance use disorders, especially among sexual and gender minority youth” (Valido et al., p. 602). This is another valuable observation that indicates the need for concomitant prevention practices of substance abuse among adolescents. No less important, substance abuse should be perceived as the consequence of psychological problems.",
    "The first mention of a homosexual act is found in the Old Testament Book of Leviticus. And it is said there about this in a prohibitive manner: “Do not lie down with a man as with a woman: this is an abomination.” (Leviticus 18:22) The Apostle Paul says the following: “Just as men, having rejected natural intercourse with women, burn with lust for one another: men do shameful deeds with men, preparing for themselves the retribution that they deserve, having gone astray.” (Rom 1:27) First of all, when talking about homosexuality – the scriptures talk about “intercourse” or “lust,” but not about orientation in the sense that homosexual people today have in mind – an equal love relationship between two partners of the same sex. Homosexual relationships have been shared at all times and in all societies. However, the idea of ​​”orientation” as a property inherent in a particular person is relatively new; it appears only towards the end of the 19th century, making it difficult to directly compare the phenomenon of homosexuality in the context of Christianity (Kuefler 1256). The second important point is comparing religious books of homosexual relationships with a relationship with women. Homosexuality existed in the ancient world and the Middle Ages – but it was never understood as an equal union. In the Christian world, the execution was supposed to be for sodomites. In England, sodomites were executed until the New Times; for a long time, homosexuals were one of the targets of the Inquisition. The Code of Justinian in Byzantium provided severe punishments for them: up to castration and the death penalty. Given the high religiosity in the authorities, such persecution was supported by religious overtones. However, there was no equal modern understanding of the union, even at the level of a philosophical idea: such events were a deviation from the norm and were not perceived fundamentally.",
    "The framers of the Constitution did not believe that citizens would take an active part in the political life of the country. While many freedoms were incorporated in the Constitution, its framers doubted whether people were interested enough in politics to follow its makings. It is true that in those times, information was limited; however, nowadays, mass media help people to be well-informed about political events. Moreover, the media act as a watchdog on the governmental powers (How Does the Media Affect Politics). Informational agencies report the events and let readers make their minds about them or share their views (How Does the Media Affect Politics). However, it always pays not to rely on the media too much and take pains to follow the political life of the country. They felt that everyday citizens were uninformed and did not care what was going on in our government. I disagree that citizens are uninformed and do not care about political life. Nowadays, there are many organizations that promote civil rights and freedoms closely following the events on the political landscape of the country. People do not wait for a crisis to voice their opinions; on the contrary, citizens try to stay well-informed about what is going on (Jach & Trolian, 2022). The media, as a great source of information, facilitates this task, allowing people to have access to the latest events all over the world (Greenberg & Page, 2015). Crises as such make people more interested in politics, but there are many people who take pains to voice their opinions, notwithstanding the political or economic situation. These people deserve great respect as they act as watchdogs on the wide judicial, legislative, and executive powers vested in our politicians and judges by the laws we have adopted as a nation.",
    "Olivier Armantier’s et al. article, “How Economic Crises Affect Inflation Beliefs: Evidence from the COVID-19 Pandemic,” was published in the Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization on July 24, 2021. Publisher Elsevier has partnered with the Copyright Center RightsLink service to offer various options for reusing this content. Elsevier offers open or restricted access to content with permanently unique identifiers to include links and citations. This paper is an independent article focusing on the state of the public economy during COVID-19. In their paper, the authors examine changes in the perception of inflation during the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although this paper is an independent work, Armantier et al. (2021) complemented other research in the field analyzing economic changes during the COVID-19 recession. A feature of the article is the study by the authors of the consequences of inflationary crises and comparison with pre-existing crises to calculate the level of the crisis as a whole. The survey’s main purpose is to collect against a wide range of economic outcomes. As a result of their research, the authors studied the evolution of households’ perceptions of inflation and concluded that the growth of inflationary expectations was more restrained. It means that the muted reaction of average inflation expectations masks a significant polarization of views, especially in the short term (Bekaert et al., 2020). A significant proportion of households, particularly those with higher education, initially expected that the pandemic would lead to low inflation or even deflation (Armantier et al., 2021). Thus, the authors achieved their goal and confirmed their results with numerous graphs and tables presented in the article. I liked the study by Armantier et al. (2021) because the authors look at non-traditionally triggered crises and household responses. In addition, through comparative analysis with past crises, Armantier et al. (2021) determine the spread of the crisis due to erroneous assumptions about inflation to other areas of the economy (Armantier et al., 2021). For example, the Great Recession was predominantly a strong negative demand shock driven by a falling house and stock prices. I also liked that the authors found evidence for strong polarization of inflation perceptions and identified differences between demographic groups.",
    "With the widespread use of digital technology, email has gained particular importance. With email, communication has become much easier, as people have been able to communicate with colleagues, relatives, loved ones, and business partners and representatives of organizations, literally in real-time, avoiding all the difficulties of “physical” communication. However, what is interesting is a study of the extent to which such communication has been modified with the advent of the phenomenon of email. In the context of interpersonal communication, two effects should be highlighted. First, email has meaningfully broadened the scope of communication so that communication is no longer only realized in the real world but can easily be continued online as well. This has changed the perception of interpersonal communication and greatly simplified the availability of communication. Meanwhile, email has changed the perception of nonverbal communication through emotions and body language, since in text correspondence, especially of a business nature, such expressions of speech do not make sense (Smith, n.d.). Of course, there are alternatives in the form of emoji and stickers, but in emails, as a rule, such forms are rarely used, unlike in messengers. From these features, an essential advantage of email is highlighted, namely increased accessibility, the possibility of virtually limitless communication, and staying connected with people at all times. However, there are also disadvantages: dependence on Internet equipment, the need for an electronic device, and any cybersecurity concerns. It is easy to make mistakes in electronic correspondence, as individuals automatically try to extrapolate real-world communication skills to the digital world. These mistakes include ignoring the type of interlocutor and lack of digital etiquette, mixing up writing styles, and sending long, unstructured messages (CNBC, 2018). To avoid making these mistakes in everyday correspondence, it is advisable to learn the rules of electronic etiquette, review your messages before sending, the appropriateness of using slang and style for specific interlocutors and reducing the letter to the minimum size that retains meaning.",
    "Despite numerous calls to concentrate on customer satisfaction or improve work engagement, countless American corporate executives remain obsessed with their companies’ financial growth. Even so, making a profit is the only way the world can tell if a company is doing things correctly. Furthermore, if a company ceases to make money, it may cease operations entirely. Clearly, some businesses lack the financial resources to fully capitalize on available product market growth opportunities. Others do not have opportunities that are commensurate with their financial means. Sources of finance and product-market opportunities influence how quickly a company can grow. To understand how fast a company should grow, a manager must first investigate the relationship between “inflation, capital costs, profitability, growth, and the market value of a company’s common stock” (Fruhan, 2014, para. 4). The profitability of a company depends on two factors: the expected return on equity (ROE) and the cost of capital. If ROE is predicted to surpass the cost of equity capital, more growth will only have a positive impact on the business’s operations and health. On the other hand, if ROE is not expected to exceed the cost of capital, then the company should consider a strategy of rapid negative growth. Insufficient earnings combined with the necessity to do little more than finance inflation-induced revenue growth can be devastating for the firm’s value (Fruhan, 2014). Businesses in this situation should contemplate a rapid slowing growth program if they are unable to increase revenue. However, in order to maintain properly set growth, a company must meet inflation expectations and even surpass the inflation rate. For example, if an inflation rate is 10%, the company must not only maintain its earnings to beat the inflation rate but try to achieve higher results. According to the statistics provided by Dow Jones, between 1965 and 1981, the inflation rate increased dramatically each year (Fruhan, 2014). Therefore, while Treasury bonds yield about 11%, overall long-term inflation expectations equal 10% (Fruhan, 2014). This means that companies must grow fast enough to keep the cost of equity capital for common stock at 19–20%. Hence, a business should grow according to the inflation rate and other indicators. This way, in order to remain lucrative to investors, an organization needs to beware of a long-term inflation rate. While Treasury bonds are predicted to yield 10% annually, companies need to provide a premium of 9–10%, which in the end equals 19–20% growth. If a company cannot meet the expectations of investors and surpass the inflation rate, it is doomed. Moreover, a company needs to check its ROE and the cost of equity capital. When the former surpasses the latter, a company will be able to create ample growth. When a business fails to oversee these two points and grows more rapidly than it can manage, it can do more harm to its financial health.",
    "The chapter in question tells the story of how global trade has enriched and changed cultures. During the analyzed period, many wealthy rulers and merchants began to demonstrate their power by acquiring exotic works of art. Ideas and books circulated, and cultural exchange was extremely active. People became more tolerant of diversity and more aware of how diverse the world around them was. Ties between different cultures were strengthened because of the continuing strong globalization. European influence had spread so far that the norms and habits of people from the West were beginning to be considered universal and objective (Adelman et al., 2021, p. 597). The key term of the era becomes the Enlightenment, marking a period of triumph of human reason. People begin to think that they can understand the laws of nature and human behavior. The importance of the chapter lies in its multifaceted analysis of the period, taking into account the contribution of each continent. Among the major events, the book describes is how the three great powers formed a group in West and South Asia. The author describes how the rulers of the Ottoman, Safavid, and Mughal dynasties contributed to the cultural development of their countries. The development of China, Japan, the two Americas, the slave states of Africa, and the development of Australia are also narrated. Particular emphasis is placed on how the interaction and mutual influence of different cultures contributed to their overall development. The sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries saw a global cultural renaissance brought on by the growth of new wealth (Adelman et al., 2021, p. 595). There was an increase in the consumption of books, and a greater number of previously unseen monuments were formed (Adelman et al., 2021, p. 595). The world has become highly integrated due to the spread of international trade. However, not all countries were willing to change and only agreed to adapt to the new norms. The Islamic and Chinese worlds generally maintained their identities, but America and Oceania could not resist European cultural pressure.",
    "Summary Today opioids are the most commonly used drug in the United States. For a long time, opiates have been used as effective pain relievers, but their relaxing effects started making people abuse them recreationally. Opioids cause a strong feeling of euphoria, which leads to the risk of using recreational substances. Addicted people have a constant desire to increase the dose, which is a severe medical and social problem. The United States is facing one of the worst drug crises in history. More than half of deaths are associated with prescription opioids: heroin and fentanyl (Coon et al., 2022). The number has risen nationwide amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The crisis has acquired enormous proportions and become a brake on the economy and a threat to national security. Forms of Treatment Available to those Suffering from Opioid Addiction The most effective way to overcome opioid addiction is recognized as “substitution therapy”. This approach involves using a drug with less addictive potential as a legal alternative to heroin and other highly addictive drugs. Three substances are currently approved for substitution therapy: methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone (Volkow et al., 2014). Medications are determined with cautiousness to avoid unwanted psychoactive effects. For example, a significant disadvantage of methadone is its ability to provoke a strong withdrawal syndrome in case of discontinuation of its use. To alleviate the patient’s condition, doctors can resort to additional help with tranquilizers, antidepressants, antipsychotics, and non-opioid analgesics. In addition, doctors widely use symptomatic treatment and supportive therapy (Volkow et al., 2014). In the severe phase of withdrawal, the patient should be under constant medical supervision. Helping a Friend or a Family Member with an Opioid Addiction The most important aspect of the treatment motivation is the family. It is necessary to help a person acquire a sincere desire to battle for life. Rehab centers remain an effective chance for an addicted person to return to a healthy, drug-free life. It uses a unique rehabilitation program that allows one not only to overcome addiction but to return to a healthy lifestyle and realize its value (Brown, 2018). To provide effective motivation, the psychiatrist should learn all the necessary data about the addicted person. It will require the assistance of relatives and friends who can tell about the psychological atmosphere, patients’ habits, interests, and family relationships.",
    "Social responsibility entails policies that organizations put in place as part of a company’s governance projected to ensure the corporate’s functions are effective and beneficial to all stakeholders. These guidelines help protect the environment, improve the quality of life for societies, and provide a conducive working environment through recognizing and appreciating talented and hardworking employees. This increases customer loyalty as clients feel they are helping the business support worthy initiatives, thus, enabling more access to funds and allowing more investors to join and support the company. The business rewards employees through meaningful praises, which makes them appreciated. It provides workers a chance to lead by example while giving them the capacity to make decisions without interference, demonstrating that they are trusted and capable (Yang et al., 2019). Additional monetary motivations comprise yearly or semi-yearly bonuses. Additionally, paid time-off and cash prizes help to boost performance while encouraging feelings. The company exercises CSR by adopting a business code of ethics, which shapes workers’ behavior on morals, standards, environment, self-esteem, and customer service. The organization has established dependable systems to protect staff and avoid accidents and injuries (Tamvada, 2020). It also ensures suppliers are aware of and meet the expectations of responsible conduct concerning issues such as affordable costs. For instance, screening dealers to define their past behavior and discuss what the company expects. The only change in CSR that I would suggest is how the organization handles employees’ creativity. I would encourage the company to set a stage for brainstorming, thus, encouraging new ideas and creativity (Tamvada, 2020). Regarding complaints about the company engagement and expenditures, it is evident that the business is striving to improve CSR, and the further it advances in that direction, the more it benefits. For instance, experiencing more brand recognition means increases in sales. Nestle has endeavored to become a socially responsible and environmentally sustainable corporation. Thus, it qualifies for a pass because of its tremendous achievement in empowering communities. It has improved people’s living standards, creating access to hygiene and clean water and motivating populations to live healthy lifestyles. I would recommend the company implement an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process (Tamvada, 2020). ERM should be applied since it is designed to find possible events that can affect the business. This will also help manage risks and opportunities and develop meaningful assurance concerning company objectives.",
    "The secret of IKEA’s success on the global market lies in its perfect execution of all components of the marketing mix. The company has adapted its strategy to each market with precision, flexibility, and creativity that made its products highly recognized. The ingenuity of its marketing mix proposal can serve as an example for other companies in Europe and worldwide. In this paper, the four components of IKEA’s marketing mix will be discussed. This Swedish company has gained renown for the quality, accessibility, and innovativeness of its products. First of all, the firm’s pricing strategy is focused on affordability, as the structure and logistics of its stores are optimized for a maximum price reduction (O’Neill, 2021). Promotions of this store chain are widespread through all communication channels, ranging from local radio stations to social media accounts made for each region individually. IKEA stays on top of modern advertising strategies and employs influencers to reach younger audiences (O’Neill, 2021). Regarding its locations, IKEA continuously selects places where it will remain accessible for the public while keeping its prices at the lowest. However, the most notable feature of this company is its products. Its home furniture is easy to recognize for its style, modularity, and reusability (O’Neill, 2021). There is a constant stream of new products in IKEA, giving customers a reason to keep visiting it on a regular basis. In conclusion, IKEA’s marketing mix shows how affordable, stylish, and recognizable products are able to capture customers’ hearts and solidify a company’s success for decades to come. There is a piece of furniture for every need and every customer’s taste, as their modularity enables creativity beyond compare. IKEA’s drive to provide its customers with products they desire gave it an immense competitive advantage in Europe and worldwide.",
    "Neil Foley talks about the role of Mexican Americans in the history of the U.S. in Mexicans in the Making of America. The author gave his view of these events in the first chapter, “The Genesis of Mexican America,” where he presented the history of the appearance of Mexican Americans and the silent conflict between the two countries. The author’s central claim is that the American government created an image of lazy Mexican immigrants who cross the border to murder and sell illicit drugs; this stigmatization affected Mexican Americans, too (Foley 34). However, the truth was that white settlers from the southern states were illegal invaders in Texas in the 1830s because they refused to obey the country’s laws (Imery-Garcia 12). Discrimination against Mexican immigrants and citizens was rooted in the 1846-1848 war and the treaty’s approval, which included Texas and Mexican people living there into the U.S. territory and being denied their rights. It was interesting to learn from this chapter the viewpoint of many people in the United States about Mexico as a country of cruel and uneducated people. Indeed, it points to the erased memory of the Aztec Empire, the abolition of slavery in Mexico much earlier than in the U.S., and the annexation of Texas. The 1846-1848 war between the two countries was an unfair, violent act of the U.S. government towards a weaker neighbor, which suffered economic downfall at that time (Foley 24). The new legislation after the war gave people the choice of returning to Mexico or becoming U.S. citizens with formally equal rights that were not respected in reality (Gutiérrez 5). Therefore, most of them wanted to be viewed as Spanish Americans rather than people of Mexican descent to avoid stigmatization. I agree with the author’s final point that this historical event created not only a political border between two neighbors but caused subsequent misunderstandings in the relationships between the two nations. In summary, the first chapter in Foley’s Mexicans in the Making of America talks about the origin of Mexican Americans. Specifically, it analyzed the role of the war between Mexico and the U.S. for Texas’s territory in the future political climate between these countries. Overall, the annexation of Texas damaged the relations between them, resulting in the negative perception of Mexican immigrant workers and the desire of Mexican Americans to hide their ancestry.",
    "When many people have a chance to interact simultaneously, especially in learning settings, it may easily lead to the occurrence of conflicts and arguments. The talkative or negative members undoubtedly impact the atmosphere within the team (Jacobs et al., 2016). It seems that “the show-off” might negatively influence the moods of all the members, considering that it is easy to get irritated by such a type of behavior (Jacobs et al., 2016). In addition, show-offs’ aim is to impress people around them, especially a group leader, and to do so, they usually opt for talking without a stop or boasting, which distracts other members. It is a common issue in group settings as such members desire to attract attention to themselves as they might be insecure or not confident in themselves. That is why the show-offs tend to answer all the questions, even those that are not directed at them. Moreover, they can attract a leader’s attention by asking irrelevant or off-topic questions. As a matter of fact, non-stop talking may be an obstacle for reaching a productive learning atmosphere as, eventually, people will be irritated and not have acquired any helpful knowledge during the lesson. The constant involvement of the show-offs in the educational process is likely to annoy other members so that they will develop hatred for such type of behavior (Forsyth, 2019). Furthermore, the show-offs can easily prevent the group from reaching the set aim by distracting them through their foolery and over-involvement in the whole process. Overall, such members can harm the group’s productivity and effectiveness in learning as they opt for attracting all the attention to themselves without giving other individuals opportunities to realize their potentials within the settings.",
    "The airline industry has been hit particularly hard by Covid 19. The virus outbreak has caused the governments of most countries to implement restrictions on traveling (Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Aviation, 2022). Thus, the regulatory implementations have negatively affected the standard revenue, business practices, and practices of airline companies. First, passengers were less keen to travel due to the testing regulations, limited resources, and the lack of need to travel for work. Another cause was the regulation themselves that implied a reduction in Covid-19 cases through quarantine measures. The low demand has caused the airlines to lose revenue ($372 bn), which was an unprecedented change in the industry (Economic impacts of covid-19 on Civil Aviation, 2021). Flights were being canceled, and employees were laid off due to the challenging situation in which the corporations could not sustain airports with such a low passenger rate. The airline companies have experienced major economic challenges that have been facilitated by all the negative implications of the pandemic on civil aviation. As a result, fewer seats were being offered (-50%), and fewer passengers were able to travel via plane (-2,7 bn) (Economic impacts of covid-19 on Civil Aviation, 2021). The effect was slightly balanced out due to the fact that cargo flights have been less impacted or even increased in rates due to the transportation of medical supplies (Nižetić, 2020, p. 10953). However, as vaccines became available and fewer restrictions were put in place, the situation has changed for the better in 2021. More opportunities have occurred due to the less rigid regulatory implementations, vaccination, and other beneficial factors. As exemplified in the relevant literature, the lost revenue in 2021 was slightly lower ($324 Bn). Even though these figures look dismal, the year 2021 has seen a slight improvement, with the years to come sure to be better and better.",
    "The researchers base their conclusion on three well-designed case studies touching on various software applications. The case studies include evaluating bone fractures following traffic accidents, bone injuries caused by a spade, and gunshot wounds on the head, which offer valuable data on enhancing contemporary forensic investigations (Buck et al., 2008). The modeling software and haptic device used for the study boast high precision, low friction, superior fidelity, and output capacity of six degrees of freedom. In the present world, these are top-notch specifications for such discourses. However, replicating the study to verify the findings may prove a challenge due to the high cost of assembling all the specimens and equipment utilized therein (Pinzon et al., 2016). The researchers do well to draw their interpretations and conclusions from the gathered data involving the three separate case studies cited above. The results of the studies indicate that haptic devices can prove very valuable in post-mortem and forensic investigations. In forensic science, the research can be instrumental in enabling investigators to recreate a crime scene (such as gun-holding position) and identify the object used in the crime with enhanced precision and speed. Hagmann et al. (2021) thus note that the use of haptics in forensic science can hasten the criminal justice process and make investigations more reliable. The research is highly innovative as it facilitates the use of technology to recreate crime scenes and enables the user to get the sense of touch often lost during such virtual excursions. Thus, the user can handle and feel 3D digital information, which is significant innovation and improves current technologies. According to Joukal et al. (2015), there may arise controversies surrounding the use of haptics due to fears of corrupting operating systems and online hacking to manipulate investigation findings. Such possibilities may impact the reliability of such devices in criminal justice proceedings. In terms of ethics, the machines make investigations much more expensive to conduct due to costly equipment and training for personnel involved (Fahrni et al., 2019). The costs may hinder the quest for justice in some cases, primarily in low-income areas. Nevertheless, the innovation is evident, and the researchers do well to draw solid conclusions based on their three well-designed case studies.",
    "The origins of slavery in the American territories and why it came to be From 1526 until 1776, complex pressures shaped the structure of slavery in the United States, and historians have proposed multiple ideas to explain how slave trade evolved. Slavery was strongly related to labor demand in European colonies, particularly in the Caribbean and South America’s labor-intensive sugar plantation industries of Great Britain, Spain, France, and the Dutch Republic. Slave ships transported captives from Africa to the West and indigenous peoples were enslaved in North American colonies on a smaller scale (OpenStax, 2019). However, Indian slavery effectively stopped in the late eighteenth century. How slavery was handled differently in each colonial territory of British North America Enslaved people worked in various sectors, including breweries, shipyards, plantations, and timber yards. In the regions north of Maryland, slavery would gradually give way to free labor. The slave population in the North progressively fell throughout the 1760s and 1770s with slaves in Philadelphia reducing to approximately 700 in 1775 (OpenStax, 2019). Antislavery activism was rife in the city, with nationalist pamphleteers handing out antislavery booklets to blacks and whites. The presence of antislavery groups facilitated the spread of manumissions thus slavery became less viable in the North. New York had a high percentage of slaves who acquired valuable trades such as masonry and goldsmithing working alongside artisan masters. All slaves in New York were freed in 1827 (OpenStax, 2019) despite the liberation sentiment in the North during the Revolutionary battle. The contrasts between indentured servants and slaves Indentured service varied from enslavement in that it was a type of debt servitude where an agreed-upon period of unpaid service that often covered the servant’s costs of immigration to America. Indentured workers were not awarded incomes, although they were housed, clothed, and nourished in most cases. Slaves were deemed property and were only awarded freedom on rare occasions despite several years of strenuous labor (Gabor, 2021). Slaves were sold, exchanged, negotiated for, and even utilized as property in a will.",
    "The issue of tribal sovereignty has been scrutinized over the years, the treatment of tribes ranging from supportive measures and attempts of integration into the broader community to outright persecution. In this connection, the law about tribal gaming can be seen as a positive step towards recognition of tribes’ unique way of life and self-determination. This essay discusses the question “how tribal gaming act can add to the sovereignty of tribes?” Under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, tribes were given the right to determine what gaming activities they wanted to engage in, and in most cases, the permission was granted by the state. Gaming activities could embrace tribal rituals or games of chance, depending on the wishes of the tribes and had to be agreed to by the state (Light and Rand). Since often tribal games are unique and have a deep meaning for the tribe, it would be right to say that granting tribes the right to hold their own games is necessary. This measure helps to uphold their culture and establish sovereignty over a very important sphere of life, which is relaxation. Moreover, gaming helps to support traditions and customs through rituals that have been molded over the centuries. As far as sovereignty is concerned, gaming serves to establish the spheres of life which are completely under the tribes’ jurisdiction. Thus, for example, some tribe members mix with the society at large, finding employment or integrating themselves in the life of big cities. However, gaming, and in particular traditional tribal gaming, serves as a reminder of one’s roots, promotes freedom of choice and sovereignty as it is the one thing that is almost completely under the tribes’ jurisdiction.",
    "Individual freedoms and national security are sometimes seen as two opposites. However, in ideal, national security should reflect the balanced relationship between the two mentioned concepts. Moreover, the principle of the prevalence of individual freedoms over the national security underlies the democratic idea. Individual freedoms include individual rights and are protected by the US Constitution (Longley). This paper argues that individual freedoms should never be sacrificed in the name of national security. This essay proposes that the protection of individual freedoms by maintaining national security is a fundamental principle and goal of democracy. US President Joe Biden notes, “I strongly believe that democracy is the key to freedom, prosperity, peace, and dignity” (Biden 3). Unlike authoritarian or totalitarian systems, a democratic system puts individual freedoms ahead of national security interests. The implementation of this principle always raises controversy, since there is no single rule universal for all cases. However, individual freedoms are protected in most areas of social life, including migration, cyber security, economic stability, and international diplomatic relations. Interestingly, actual cyber security policy and practice take both human-centric and national-security-centric approaches (Deibert 411). In this regard, the states develop “indivisible network security on a planetary scale for the widest possible coverage of the human experience” (Deibert 412). The above example indicates the breadth of possibilities for applying the principle. There is probably a counter-argument against the opinion that national security interests should take precedence over individual freedoms. This position can be justified by an external threat or military ambitions and is usually applied by authoritarian regimes. This position is wrong since national security should protect the interest of every citizen, not the abstract idea of the nation. Every citizen is part of the nation and their freedoms should be sacred. Thus, it was discussed, how individual freedoms should never be sacrificed in the name of national security. The necessity to sacrifice individual freedoms is usually promoted by authoritarian regimes whose real purpose is to meet the interests of the regime. On the contrary, in democratic states, individual freedoms are fundamental and cannot be violated under any circumstances. These freedoms are sacred and ensure the integrity of the democratic states.",
    "Elements Diamonds by Rihanna was first heard on Elvis Duran Show on September 26, 2012, availed for online download an hour after being released to the public, and was released as the album’s lead single the following day. Sia wrote the song for Rihanna, who holds the song’s copyrights and worked on it a year prior; therefore, the song is owned by an independent contractor (Anggraini 12). Unapologetic is Barbadian artist Rihanna’s seventh studio album, and the song “Diamonds” appears on it (Anggraini 7). Using Sia’s demo vocals as a guide, Rihanna imitated her inflections to the precise tiniest detail. It was only after Benny Blanco heard the finished track to the Australian songwriter did, she realize the vocals belonged to her alone. Inspiration In Diamonds , Rihanna contemplated the existence of both love and diamonds: “Yellow diamonds in the light. To make things even more awkward, we’re standing next to each other. You cross my path as your shadow does.” The diamonds in the song symbolize a silver lining that illustrates the chance for a better future and happier days among dark and depressing days. The song made me think about all the possibilities available when things do not turn out to be as I expected. I also chose the song because its presentation, which was both positive and hopeful, and I am always in a good mood when I listen to it. It is also quite inspirational because it encourages listeners to love themselves. Since its launch, the song has won multiple awards and has enjoyed massive success for years. For Rihanna’s career, the song gave a great boost because it was quite catchy and everyone could recognize it from the very first minutes of it playing.",
    "Different circumstances under which medical staff has worked led to varying types of leadership strategies being developed. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the role of clear communication and the handling of prompt preparation in top healthcare leaders (Nicola et al., 2020). Another key tactic includes the use of external change agents that ultimately promote excellent organizational decision-making (Alagoz et al., 2018). Moreover, one study explained how implementing positivity-related and open-minded approaches as leaders can improve their employee’s resilience, providing an additional source of motivation (Wei et al., 2018). Hence, effective healthcare leaders must adapt to various external changes and strategically communicate with their coworkers. Several departments can be interacted with through the role of a healthcare administrator. One of them includes the in-patient department where multiple approaches from skilled professionals are needed. Moreover, critical care and A&E require excellent management and collaborating opportunities. As already mentioned, the selected healthcare areas are prime examples of fields requiring strong leaders to provide optimal patient care. One way this can be improved to obtain the desired outcomes is through a holistic approach that considers external and internal factors. Furthermore, collective decision-making should not be viewed as limiting to effective leadership; on the contrary, it presents an ideal strategy in healthcare management. The importance of interprofessional collaboration in medical institutions is evident through its effect on patient outcomes. Research has demonstrated significant changes in healthcare conditions after the implementation of the strategy (Spaulding et al., 2018). The method involves acquiring knowledge from colleagues and incorporating it into one’s practice, seeking advice from the respective medical staff. Therefore, the strategy impacts the range of services professionals can offer to their patients and should be worked on further to improve its practicality.",
    "Net Present Value (NPV) reflects the amount of cash an investor or funder expects to receive from a project after inflows are recouped through all sorts of costs. This figure can be understood as the investor’s total profit generated once the payback begins. NPV gives a clear indication of whether a project is worth investing in based on likely costs and potential risk. NVP has many more advantages over other investment criteria. The rules that apply to NVP include common sense and the reasonableness of the investment and take into account return criteria. Since the calculation of NVP involves a time horizon, it is already profitable over static measures. Accordingly, the first advantage of NVP is its connection to the idea of an expected value, which will be less than at the time of investment. Unlike the payback period, NVP recognizes that the value of a currency is temporary and subject to change, so it lays this metric into the calculation of discount rates. Assumptions about the cost of capital allow the NVP to be calculated and suggest a strategy for profitable ways to implement the project. Consequently, the second advantage of this criterion is flexibility and additivity, that is, understanding the benefits of all available projects or one specific one. A third advantage may be that the calculation of NVP considers the size of the investment. This means that NVP is a unidimensional criterion that allows us to estimate the degree of probability of wealth creation based on the number of cash flows. Thus, NVP has several advantages over other investment criteria based on its application. First, NVP considers the present value of money, which gives a clear picture of cash transactions. Second, it is flexible and additive, meaning it evaluates the cost of capital and the appropriateness of the investment. Third, NVP is a one-dimensional indicator that considers all, even space investments.",
    "To properly manage business outputs, it is crucial to examine the external environment of the industry in question. The 7-Eleven organization could greatly benefit from implementing the I/O Model of Above-Average Returns, which relies on the examination of the firm’s external conditions. As such, the first stage involves the analysis of the industry and competitor environment, creating a clear picture of the general atmosphere (Hitt et al., 2007). For the 7-Eleven corporation, the competitors are such large-scale convenience stores as Walmart and Target. However, as the overall industry grows and generates a significant amount of revenue, it creates a positive atmosphere for further development. Another factor to consider is the industry’s attractiveness, as it must possess a high potential for the firm to generate above-average returns. In the current age, the convenience store segment is considered exceptionally beneficial for securing above-average returns due to the increasing demand for large-scale product distribution shops (Graves, 2017). The demand for the variety of choices and the improving financial position of American citizens suggest that the industry’s structural characteristics are quite favorable. After that, 7-Eleven would be required to select a strategy that would ensure the provision of above-average returns. A promising approach could be the implementation of the chain store method, where several branches are established across different countries. However, to apply this technique, particular assets and skills are needed (Hitt et al., 2007). The first criterion is the possession of the products and resources necessary to launch an international branch, as the costs of sustaining a new location in a different country can be demanding (Graves, 2017). In addition, the executives must account for the economic environment of the chosen state, meaning that it is vital to be skilled in international trade and branch management. Finally, to implement the selected approach, it is necessary to establish which actions will be performed to achieve the above-average returns. For 7-Eleven, it would be beneficial to use the company’s strengths in this endeavor, namely the existence of other international branches and the successful history of operations in the US (Lee, 2021). By relying on the previously obtained knowledge and integrating global expansion into the organization’s goals, 7-Eleven might perfectly utilize the formulated strategy and earn above-average returns.",
    "The suggested strategies to mitigate the effects of coronavirus in accordance with the example of Iceland could be considered as an interesting approach. This strategy acknowledges its apparent limitations, such as the resilience of the Iceland community, geographical idiosyncrasy. However, currently, this strategy might not be a valid method to address the high margins of infected individuals in NATO countries. It is certainly true that quick response and high testing rates would contribute to the deterrence of the effects imposed by the sudden growth of the number of infected. However, it is similarly meaningful that the population would be willing to undergo such a measure. Moreover, despite the financial support efforts, some countries belonging to the organization might not be able to financially withstand the high amount of testing imposed by the new waves of infection. This fact is especially relevant given that the virus dissemination might emerge across several countries simultaneously. Therefore, a different approach to the problem might be necessary. The Israeli government approached the problem of monitoring the infected with the creative solution of digital epidemiological investigation (Amit et al., 2020). This technology allowed tracking potential contacts of people that were infected and act accordingly (Amit et al., 2020). However, it is arguable that this methodology could address the geographical limitations introduced in the case of Iceland. It would be difficult for NATO countries to strictly monitor all entrances to their borders. Therefore, an analog in the form of digital tracking may solve the problem with the need for strict borders control and provide necessary tools for timely reaction to the new outbreaks. Nevertheless, it would require funds both internal and external in order to build new or reconstruct the existing infrastructure for the stated purposes.",
    "The introduced Canadian perspective on the provisional agenda of the North Atlantic Council seems to cover key points that concern Canadian security. Increased presence in the world peace operations and maintenance of tight relationships with other NATO members, especially remarkable is the smart defense approach that considers the military and economic needs of Canada. Although, it is difficult to judge the extent of the Syrian threat to Canadian interest during the outbreak of coronavirus, which seems to continue even today. Therefore, it would be essential to review the proposed question for a more effective approach to the defense of Canadian interests. Nevertheless, this act protects the interest of both Israel and Canada and will positively impact their relationship. Furthermore, it is notable how the Canadian government is willing to cooperate with the withdrawal of troops from Iraq if the official request were to be made. This statement in itself is probably a contribution to the international image of Canadian humanitarianism, but the extent of such image improvement is questionable. The focus on building trading relationships and close ties with other NATO countries could be seen as the most important aspect that Israel might acknowledge. Israel’s national security has experienced decades of varying threats, which included terrorism, missiles, and existential nuclear dangers (Freilich, 2018). However, the former national security strategy (NSS) is non-existent in the country as the first document of NSS was developed in 1953 (Freilich, 2018). Nevertheless, the country is more secure than ever before due to the political and military bonds it forms active trade agreements with various powerful countries such as the USA, China, Russia, Germany, Canada, Poland, and India (Freilich, 2018). Currently, the country exhibits great regional power and is able to prosper due to the seven-decades-old strategy.",
    "The current issue with Nike stems from its corrupt corporate culture, which puts women in a position of weakness. It allows powerful men in charge of the company to abuse and suppresses them, preventing them from reaching the positions they deserve without being harassed or denigrated. There are four potential ways of dealing with a problem: absolving, solving, resolving, and dissolving (Ackoff, 2019). Given the scope and the long-term aims for Nike and society in general, the only acceptable solution would be to dissolve it. The process of dissolution revolves around removing the underlying causes for the problem to exist in the first place. Absolving means ignoring the problem, solving – giving the women that were harmed some sort of compensation without making changes, and resolving – giving them the means to fight back without actively trying to change the toxic culture towards something better (Singh, 2018). Just allowing women to fight back is not enough – Nike should make it so that they do not have to. From an organizational framework perspective, the transformation of Nike’s culture should be done on all levels, from top to bottom. If harassment, cronyism, and corruption are acceptable at the top, there is nothing to stop them from occurring at the bottom levels (Singh, 2018). Therefore, Parker and the rest of Nike’s leadership must implement policies and solutions on all levels. This involves disincentivizing such behavior and ensuring that any potential sources of it are extinguished before they could take root again. The proposed plan of action, thus, is to conduct a massive revision of every individual employee and manager to determine their complicity in the acts that have been perpetrated in Nike for ages. All individuals found complicit should be removed from the company. That includes Mr. Parker and the rest of the board themselves, as they have been benefitting from the system while closing their eyes on it. The new leadership would be the one to implement and install a new culture based on equality, capability, and diversity.",
    "The deep socio-economic divides in American society have impacted the unemployment rates even before the COVID-19 pandemic; however, the virus has exacerbated the issue. There have been two distinct experiences during the pandemic: first, people with graduate education, who kept stable jobs through working remotely; second, those who either lost or got reduced in their jobs with no safety net (Blustein et al., 2020). The key determinants of work availability are power and privilege, unevenly divided across racial, gender, and education lines (Blustein et al., 2020). The national socio-economic gaps lie between those who have a college education and those who do not (Galea & Abdalla, 2020). Within the framework of education access, race and ethnicity represent a major division plane between Americans. The black demographic faces racism in hiring, seeking housing, and everyday life, resulting in systemic marginalization (Galea & Abdalla, 2020). Therefore, the issue of unequal job availability persists, with racial divides being particularly striking recently. Discerning socio-economic groups’ post-pandemic recovery rates from April 2020 paints a clear picture. The divide is demonstrated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (2022): there seems to be an improvement post-pandemic, with the average unemployment rate decreasing from 14.7% in April 2020 to 4% now. However, for the black population, the unemployment rate reached 16.8% in April 2020; later, stalled at 10.9% in October 2020 and then only lowered to 6.9% in January 2022 (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2022). In contrast, the white demographic presents a steady decrease within six months from April 2020; by October 2020, unemployment more than halved from 14.1% to 6.0%. Higher education, stable jobs, and support networks contribute to the higher-than-average unemployment rates for the black demographic (Galea & Abdalla, 2020). This statistic demonstrates the uneven struggle to recover from the pandemic-induced and general unemployment.",
    "Considerable musicians have represented soul music, and James Brown was one of the most prominent. Southern soul became extremely popular towards the end of the 1960s, and Brown had his first success in 1956 (Covach and Flory 218). Initially, Brown worked as a stand-in for Little Richard, and his first record, “Please Please Please,” was quite thriving (Covach and Flory 240-241). Brown used to sing lead vocals, and his early musical style resembled that of the 1950s doo-wop (Covach and Flory 242). However, he began to develop the soul style in 1960 with “Think,” characterized by horns and a driving rhythm section (Covach and Flory 242). In 1964, Brown introduced “Out of Sight,” which represented the hard-driving soul style featured in his later songs towards the 1970s (Covach and Flory 242). James Brown was one of the performers who took control of their music, as he united an aggressive style of vocal and dance performance, production skills, and understanding of business (Covach and Flory 242). Brown’s musical style through the 1960s and into the 1970s changed from following prior era’s themes to creating his unique sounds. As Brown was searching for and evolving his individual style, his career differed from Motown, Stax, or Atlantic artists and led him to produce distinguishable songs. For instance, the stops at the end of the verses in Brown’s “Papa’s Got a Brand New Bag, Pt. 1” distinct the music from a Stax arrangement (Covach and Flory 243). At the same time, the absence of background vocals in the song varies from Motown’s approach (Covach and Flory 243). Moreover, James Brown’s music was highly famous within the Black community, as, unlike Motown and Atlantic artists, Brown expressed apparent racial pride through hard-edged musical style and political lyrics (Covach and Flory 244). Brown acted passionately on his live shows as a singer, dancer, and bandleader but also hired notable musicians and rehearsed them tirelessly (Covach and Flory 240). James Brown was a remarkable performer whose vision of music and societal norms differed from other professionals.",
    "Janina’s language in the novel Drive Your Plow over the Bones of the Dead is unique in many ways, as she unravels the mystery surrounding not only the murders but her personality. However, one of the most notable traits that the reader may notice on the first page is Janina’s use of nicknames as substitutes for any person or animal’s name. While many people use nicknames for friends or people they dislike, Janina’s approach is built on her feelings towards her name and names in general. She states, “I believe each of us sees the other person in our way, so we should give them the name we consider suitable.” She considers names “polyonymous” and adheres to this rule for every character she encounters. As a result, each person that Janina talks with or about is transformed into the characteristic she sees in them. Her friend is Oddball – and from the beginning, the reader has to inherently accept that this person may be strange somehow, although it may not be accurate. Similarly, the murder victims – Big Foot, Commandant, Inner – have to be seen as the traits of appearance or status they have in Janina’s eyes. In contrast, when Janina thinks about a name for a rescue dog, her first idea is a human name, Marysia. She denies other pet names, saying that “considering her personal history” they could not be suitable for the dog. Thus, Janina thinks deeply about the animal’s life and problems, basing the name on the dog’s condition and story. By looking at the contrast between names and nicknames that Janina uses for people and animals, one can see her actual values. She loves animals while humans get judged or excluded for their oddity. Therefore, while the narrator is untrustworthy, she quickly gives away her views on the murders and exposes her potential role in them. Her nature is to judge people for their treatment of animals, and the latter is perceived as better, more worthy of saving than humans.",
    "John Smeaton was an English engineer who designed bridges, canals, and lighthouses. In the given article, written by Andrew M. A. Morris, the author demonstrates how this renowned engineer employed parameter variation in a far more broad context as part of an analytical procedure (Morris, 2021). Morris stresses the three distinct goals of such a process, including optimization, theory testing, and maxim development through exploratory testing. As the writer puts it, the fundamental point of this study is that Smeaton accomplished more than enhanced engineering processes by systematizing prior artisanal ways, as was the traditional interpretation of Smeaton’s method established by technology analysts in the 1990s (Morris, 2021). Rather, he claims that his method creates a link between science and technology by including both theory testing and practical testing (Morris, 2021). I agree with the author and believe that John Smeaton was successful at performing the traditionally seen hypothesis testing and developed empirical regularities through exploratory experimentation. While some scholars might claim that no scientific research was involved in the work of Smeaton, the engineer managed to go through a thorough analysis and create his own maxims. Morris also discussed the relationship between science and technology during the Industrial Revolution. According to Morris, the conventional understanding of it was determined by two nearly obsolete historical studies, which are reflected in the discussion between A.E. Musson, and Eric Robinson, and A. Rupert Hall (Morris, 2021). According to the first two researchers, science was an essential aspect of the industrial Era (Morris, 2021). Hall, conversely, believes that the 18th-century technical innovations attributed almost nothing to the era’s science. The way I see it, Hall’s opinion does not have a solid ground. The Industrial Revolution, in my perspective, was an amalgam of technology, science, and industry. Significant breakthroughs and technical advancements shaped nearly every present field of people’s lives while also introducing a slew of new ones. It is well known that during the early stages of the Revolution, natural forms of energy, such as wind and water, were harnessed to generate electricity. However, later, new technologies, including steam power, were investigated and improved by John Smeaton, and electricity was critical in enabling the Industrial Revolution to flourish.",
    "The percentage of uninsured people in my state, Washington, is among the lowest. Particularly, it was 6.6% as of 2019, which is considerably lower than in Oklahoma (14.9%) or Texas (18.4%) (Kaiser Family Foundation, n.d.). In my opinion, the connection between the socioeconomic status and access to care is evident. The fewer opportunities a person has in terms of financial provision, the less possible it is for them to afford high-quality health care. Individuals with low income are highly likely to be uninsured or eligible for Medicaid. As a result, such citizens do not seek health care as often as it is needed. Frequently, they only address specialists in emergency cases, neglecting many other issues that require prevention or treatment. I think that the main reason why the percentage is low in my state is because of its geographic location. There are many job opportunities in the state of Washington, which means people can afford to pay for health insurance. Also, individuals living in this state are well-informed about their options regarding health needs. Apart from that, the number of healthcare facilities is much higher than, say, in rural areas. All of these factors contribute to the high level of insured people. Speaking about the gap in quality of care and access to health care, I should also note such factors as ethnic disparities, access to education, and community context. In my state, it is easier for people from diverse backgrounds to accommodate and find support. However, there are parts of the country where some ethnic groups might be accepted with prejudice, which makes it difficult for them to pursue high-quality education and find well-paid jobs.",
    "Kantian ethics is the clearest example of non-consequential theories in philosophy, and by extension, in law. Support for the theory often comes from adherents of imperative social order ideas such as utilitarianism. In Kant’s philosophy, the ideas of non-consequential ethics are most clearly demonstrated by the moral and ethical phenomenon he formulated and called the categorical imperative. This concept, as conceived by Kant, is the formulation of how a person should act, striving to partake in genuinely moral behavior (Kant & Abbott, 2021). The imperative directly addresses the acting person, who makes specific moral choices according to the predetermined rational ways. It advises a person to strictly and urgently, most attentively, treat the maxims of their behavior, namely to the subjective rules of practical reason. According to Kant, the principles of pure practical reason have a specific non-consequential form (Kant & Abbott, 2021). They are statements containing a general definition of will, which is subject to many practical rules; this notion has particular problems in the very essence of the statement. It should be discussed how Kant understands ethics in greater detail. Namely, morality should not be relative, bound by private interests, but absolute and universal; otherwise, it does not exist at all (Kant & Abbott, 2021). In other words, relativism is the enemy of genuine morality, the contingency of principles, and adaptation to the situation. In this aspect of Kant’s philosophy, the conflict between the fundamental, strictly necessary, universal moral law, which Kant defends, and the always determined circumstances, the actions of specific people, acquires a particularly sharp form. This conflict arises at the forefront of Kant’s non-consequential ethical position. After all, a specific person cannot live and act otherwise than focusing on circumstances, building their own subjective maxims of behavior. Perhaps they have no reason to be guided by universal morality, and in this case, the universal moral law–the categorical imperative–becomes just an idea and a chimera.",
    "Labor racketeering can be defined as the illegal use of unions and authority for self-interest. Union labor corruption was perpetrated by, performed in collaboration with, or under the direction of organized criminal syndicates. The beginning of the 20th century set the foundation for labor racketeering and became a law and societal concern (Jacobs, 2020). Until the late 1970s and early 1980s, there was no systematic governmental or enforcement agencies effort to mitigate the issue (Jacobs, 2020). During prohibition, criminal groups chose to generate profit from selling illicit spirits, which maintained the alcohol demand and earnings high. When prohibition was abolished in the 1930s, the mafia’s advanced business-running methods remained (Jacobs, 2020). The most potent groups turned their focus away from alcohol to business, including narcotics, gambling, and prostitution (Jacobs, 2020). However, these were not the only money-making businesses that contributed to the profit diversification. Among other beneficial businesses for the organized crime was labor racketeering through the control of labor unions. There are many reasons why gangs prefer labor unions to other kinds of unions. For example, it can be evident from their choice to control the Teamsters and International Longshoremen’s Association (Jacobs, 2020). With the sources of such unions, members of Cosa Nostra could easily access all kinds of legitimate businesses, including waste management, construction, or demolition. Moreover, they had easy access to healthcare and pension funds from the unions. These legitimate businesses offered them ways to not only traffick illicit substances or people but also cover up their actions (Jacobs, 2020). Among other crimes, the organized groups performed extortions or threatened employers, and solicited or received bribes. Hence, it can be seen that organized crime has always tried to control local businesses and expand their influence with the help of diversification of their profits. Among the main activities of gangs were prostitution, drug trafficking, gambling, and labor racketeering. Labor unions were beneficial to organized crime due to the sources they had. Such unions gave mobsters access to legitimate demolition, construction, and waste management businesses.",
    "There are many different scientific approaches to language studies; one of them is the prescriptive method. This principle can generally be described as a set of rules that prescribe speaking or writing. Crystal (1987) notes that prescriptivism is a perspective that chooses one of the interpretations of a language as the standard and extends it to the entire society. This variation is most often found in formal speech and literature. An alternative perspective is a descriptive approach based not on standards but on the actual situation. The proponent of this method simply describes the facts of linguistic variousness (Crystal, 1987). They act as an observer, not constrained by the official framework. Although these methods are opposite in meaning, each of them can be applied in the appropriate context. Crystal (1987) notes that exploring these methods often leads to an unrealistic depiction of the opposite side, the formation of prejudice and confrontation. However, both approaches should exist together, combining the positive aspects of each other. While the prescriptive approach allows the design of society to be arranged, the descriptive approach allows the recording of real language changes (Crystal, 1987). This, in turn, allows combining logic and the natural order of things. However, not all language changes are received positively due to misconceptions. The clearest example is the belief that change means deterioration, as the old generation constantly complains (Crystal, 1987). In addition, language changes are associated with a decline in the quality of education and the negative impact of the media. Nevertheless, the author selects sufficient counterarguments to all these fears. The elders are always resentful of change, as evidenced by historical correspondence. Deterioration in the quality of education and social tension arises only if these changes occur abruptly. Nevertheless, such cases are extremely rare, so I agree with these comments. As Crystal (1987) points out, it is common for the older generation to dislike the modern world, as evidenced by the literature. The influence of the media and the quality of education is not always necessarily linked to direct language changes. Therefore, my support for this position is based on the fact that people are usually afraid of change. Most people need the consistency of developed habits and methods in life. However, language change is a natural process that is not subject to official structures and is formed together with society and its most progressive members.",
    "Changes in the global management paradigm have affected one of the most important components of management – the leadership process. The technological and information revolution has led to the fact that most businesses have the ability to scale their activities to a global scale. This gave the leaders, on the one hand, the opportunity to enter global markets. On the other hand, it led to the need to design business changes in such a way that the company was ready to win against an unlimited number of competitors at every stage of development. This implies the first requirement for a future business leader: a company mission that does not provide for the pursuit of global leadership will not lead to success. Therefore, the design of change should be based on the goal of achieving global leadership, which refers primarily to cultural management skills. No one can deny the fact that cultural differences have a significant impact on the behavior and actions of a leader. Based on this, it becomes quite obvious that these differences are usually reflected in the ways of distributing working time, decision-making, and methods of motivation. The concept of leadership is an integral element in the system of international relations, which largely determines the course of the world’s political and economic processes. According to Ratanjee (2021), “the topic of developing a global mindset and exposing leaders to multicountry and multicultural experiences is gaining increasing interest” (pp. 2). It is clear that transformational leadership in the leadership process is strongly suggested for future leaders. Bonsu and Evans (2018) state that “embracing cross-cultural transformational leadership is strategic to business growth in an era of globalization, efficiency in technology and information dissemination, and parity of education and skills” (p. 50). With discernment and charisma, transformational leaders are able to inspire those around them to change their expectations and motivations in order to move towards higher goals.",
    "Goals and objectives outline desired outcomes and, thus, are often used interchangeably. However, the effect, timeframe, and specificity of the two terms set them apart. Nickels et al. (2019) define goals as broad and long-term outcomes that an organization seeks, while objectives define the measurable, specific, and short-term strategies for attaining the identified goal. For example, the criminal justice system uses goals to task the police, correctional agencies, and the court with the strategy to execute, including deterrence, rehabilitation, retribution, restoration, and incapacitation. Therefore, the criminal justice system particularly addresses criminal behavior with the objective of protecting people’s rights. In an era of rapid change, diversity, and complexity, leadership and management are critical to the survival of any agency. Besides, the ability to lead and manage strongly permeates every aspect of the criminal justice system. While leaders guide the change through a vision, managers implement coordinated processes and structures to pursue organizational goals and objectives (Nickels et al., 2019). Leaders are constantly challenged to take risks and encourage transformation. In law enforcement, for example, police leaders must develop and instill high standards in other officers to work toward the same goal. Beyond leadership, criminal justice relies on managers to optimize processes and lead efforts toward reliable outcomes. Generally, criminal justice leaders and managers work effectively to balance ethical and legal considerations. Earning a degree in criminal justice would significantly contribute to meeting my long-term goals. I have always taken pride in influencing change as a leader. However, I must leverage my education with experience in the criminal justice system to become more efficient and productive. The criminal justice system is becoming increasingly complex and requires more lasting and transformative trends. As such, the second goal is to become more adaptable to change. Bringing significant change through robust analytical skills is an objective in itself. Also, gaining strong relational skills to work with professionals and serve people from diverse backgrounds.",
    "The phrase that caught me most from the video is from Isaiah, stating that Samuel has taught him that one person can play t-ball and hit it hard when sitting down. This is a powerful statement indicating that people can be prejudiced despite having good intentions. Samuel’s family did not realize the struggles disabled people go through before he was born (PinehurstPictures, 2010). The child’s image hitting the t-ball also showcased a powerful issue, that disabled individuals should be treated similarly to other people and given equal opportunities to give them the chance to perform optimally. I was intrigued to see children like Nathanial Orellana learning in a normal classroom. His mother determined they sought school actively to ensure he received the best care considering his autism (PinehurstPictures, 2010). Parents face a myriad of extra challenges raising disabled children to give them advantages that would help them compete with their peers in society. The video illustrates that communities and the government should provide parents with a variety of schools to determine the best for their child’s disability. Children with disabilities require special care but should be allowed to interact with others if their illness would not worsen based on these connections. Engagement is a crucial tool for child development as it requires them to be attentive and active, propagating greater achievement due to increased enthusiasm. Nathanial raises his hand to answer a question because each student is engaged in the classroom. His enthusiasm to answer the question shows interest and a desire to learn, traits associated with high achievement. The video is helpful because it provides a glimpse of the life individuals with disabilities pass through. Many of these parents face issues with education as they would like their children to receive the best education while also avoiding the pitfalls that other children do not face. Emily, a mental health advocate, has schizophrenia and discerns that people without the illness cannot fully understand their plight (PinehurstPictures, 2010). In this aspect, people without developmental problems may not see the issues they face and should work hard to help them optimally function in society. Keith Jones also showcases an important faction of society. He claims that individuals should not expect children to develop good social skills if they stay for eight hours in a classroom without adequate interaction (PinehurstPictures, 2010). It is crucial to recognize that inclusion would work well if children were given a chance to interact frequently despite their differences.",
    "The article’s thesis statement is supported by the further reading authors investigating the case of a strange change in Professor Wilson’s lifestyle. Indeed, the reasoning behind such a decision was complex, and it includes elements of achieving maximum sustainability in the tiniest space possible. In addition, the article mentions that he shares his experiences during the nights when his ecology-focused students are invited to stay in the dumpster with him. The article caught my attention with a few details. First of all, the scenario where a respected scholar lives in the dumpster reminded me of an Ancient Greek philosopher Diogenes who lived in the barrel. Hence, it was interesting to investigate the topic and find if there are any similarities between the two. Furthermore, giving personal details and the personal background of the divorced professor added a bit of psychological interest to it. I wondered if the divorce affects men so severely that they are ready for such a downshift. But these are all subconscious thoughts and triggers. The visuals in the article were crucial to me because I felt a little tired when I started reading. Hence, being able to scroll down and see the pictures of the dumpster, pictures of day-to-day activities, and the interior of the dumpster was a way of relaxing and thinking about the subject. After looking at pictures, I had some questions; therefore, I had a personal interest in reading the article to find the answers. Honestly, the interior of the dumpster does not look that bad, and the best thing is that Wilson is able to lay there comfortably. Therefore, personally, living in a dumpster is an option for times when I feel like I need to be alone. But lack of commodities associated with the home kitchen and bathroom is why I could not choose the dumpster as a place of my permanent residence.",
    "Both lookism and extreme body modification are inherently linked to unhealthy and unrealistic beauty standards of modern society. This trait aside, however, the two are very different in its manifestations and direct consequences. Lookism is merely the act of considering someone whose appearance is not what most people would regard to be beautiful. It focuses on exhibiting negative judgement to people that do not fit the standard and is thus oriented outside of the person who engages in it. Extreme body modification is the act of changing one’s body in order to look in a way that deviates from the norms that society sets on appearance (Good, 2016). To contrast these two, one does not look pleasing in appearance, while the other intentionally marks oneself in ways that others would perceive as deviances or outside of societal standards. The differences between the two stem from their external or internal angles, despite both being related to the dissatisfaction with appearance. It is likely that a person who engages in lookism is deeply insecure about their own beauty, and thus takes a judgemental stance towards the beauty of others. Obsessiveness over other peoples’ features or grooming habits generally signals a very unhealthy relationship with self-image, despite being less visible than bodily modifications (Good, 2016). Meanwhile, said modifications can happen both by a person’s own accord, and as an act of social pressure or custom. An example of the latter would be an ancient Chinese tradition of binding female feet to make them small and rose-like in their shape. More often then not, the expectations of extreme bodily modifications are placed on women, who are expected to conform to them in certain cultures to uphold their respectability and perceived marital value.",
    "The Prince, written by Nicholas Machiavelli, is an important contribution to the modern concept of politics. In a sense, this work contradicts the philosophical tradition of ancient political thought in which political practice is overshadowed by the idealization of governments and utopian cities. On the contrary, in Prince, Machiavelli (2014) establishes that the real implementation of politics implies real situations with real people whose behavior, decisions and actions usually are not necessarily moral. The main theme of “The Prince” by Machiavelli is monarchical rule and survival. This work was regarded as a guide for politicians on the use of ruthless, self-serving cunning and inspired the term “Machiavellian”. Machiavelli (2014) discusses in detail how a ruler should act in various situations or circumstances and establishes that the main goal of politics is the successful retention of power. The book had a lasting effect on political thought since in it, Machiavelli opposed the traditional attitude to politics that serves the people to a benign self-interest, where the ruler is self-centered and focused on his goals. The book justifies any means as long as they help the governor to achieve his aims. According to Hobbes, people are egoistic, greedy, and seek personal gain. Egoism is declared to be the main incentive of human activity. But Hobbes does not condemn people for their selfish inclinations, does not believe that they are evil by nature. Many people find Hobbes’ view cynical as it is too simplified and not all actions can be explained by egoism. For example, there are a lot of people and charity organizations that donate their money and time for free without any personal gain. As for me, I find human nature infinitely more complex than power-seeking individuals described in Hobbes’s work.",
    "Levels of culture can be displayed in different planes and depths. According to Edgar Shein, who developed the concept ‘levels of organizational culture,’ and Edward Granter who later expanded on this concept, the culture of the entity can be seen in four levels: super-structural, symbolic, discursive, and cognitive (Granter, 2019). In other words, the levels of culture in enterprises are developed due to external economic and social influences, artifacts such as logos, story rituals and events, values explicitly expressed by the organization, and underlying assumptions. This paper aims to assess the levels of organizational culture for Macomb Community College. Artifacts in Macomb Community College show that it promotes concentration, attentiveness, and responsibility, which is reflected in the logo. Looking at the architecture of the buildings, some of which use chrome-plated modern high-tech structures, one can assume that technology and science are the main focus of educational programs. Nonetheless, the central older building and a park with large trees create an atmosphere of solitude and introspection, which is more in line with the study of fine arts and social sciences. Equally important, the college has a high culture of mutual help and respect and cherishes community relations, which is reflected in the developed bus route system available to students. On the value level, many signs within the college, including parking signs, library signs, and other clues, point to a love of order and organization. Probably in this college, teachers appreciate the composure and commitment shown by students. On the level of assumptions, the college probably seeks to avoid accepting students who are overly self-expressive or whose identity is tied to superficial popular culture. The college website lacks flashy headlines or programs offering to participate in the community in a frivolous way, such as selling cookies for fundraising or taking part in field trips. Thus, the levels of organizational culture at the Macomb Community College were assessed. The college has a clear identity at the level of artifacts and values. At the same time, the analysis of underlying assumptions suggests several recommendations. Perhaps, the college underestimates the importance of openness in relationships and is too harsh on manifestations of superficial identity or judgment. Given the high commitment to social and community values, Macomb Community College members should consider that openness is an important value for building good social connections.",
    "The story of King Uruk, or Gilgamesh, is widely recognized as the first known explanation of the relationship between humans and gods. In other words, The Epic of Gilgamesh is the first mention of mythology in our world. To be more exact, the piece’s primary focus is on King Uruk’s transformation from a horrible ruler to a kind one when he is forced to face mortality. As stated, the main character of this story is the King of Uruk, who now serves as a reminder that in the early times, humans used to feel the same as we did. According to Anneberg Learner (2021), this writing is older than Bible since it is “four thousand years old in its oldest form.” Therefore, The Epic of Gilgamesh describes the life of Uruk’s ruler, above all other kings, considering that he was special, “he was two-thirds divine and one-third human” (Anneberg Learner, 2021). However, when the gods realized that they could not handle such an arrogant ruler, they sent Gilgamesh’s copy, Enkidu. Finally, the King of Uruk realized the significance of social interaction, “wonderful about being engaged with another human being” (Anneberg Learner, 2021). It is significant to note that Enkidu actually started the same way as Adam and, consequently, was humanized by the prostitute sent by the gods. Still, one fatal mistake of Enkidu and Gilgamesh leads to the first’s inevitable death, and when the King of Uruk realizes that his friend is dead, he starts seeking immortality. Overall, the story’s main idea is that the gods created immortality only for themselves, while humans will always be followed by death. Eventually, as Gilgamesh’s chance to live forever was stolen by a serpent, he finally realized his treasure, knowing the past and ability to return back to his city. At the end of the story, the town survives its ruler, which is why such a powerful message leads to the human population remembering it ever since.",
    "Motivation is the process whereby an individual’s endeavors are stimulated, guided, and maintained toward achieving a goal. Thus, the responsibility of management is to monitor and direct workers in a company (Usmonovich, 2021). This is required since it is a method of inducing individuals to work, which they are capable and equipped to do freely. Even though most people have to work for a livelihood and a job is an essential part of everyone’s lives, administrators must be apprehensive about employee motivation concerns for various reasons. Managers have several valid reasons to be concerned about motivating employees. Firstly, individual success in a company is viewed as a product of talent and inspiration. Additionally, the ability is influenced by education, expertise, and learning, and its development is a difficult and laborious process, whereas motivation may be accelerated (Usmonovich, 2021). Thus, employee motivation is widely recognized as critical to a corporation’s success. In addition, a business that struggles with staff motivation is more likely to experience lower output, defective manufacturing, or other problems, and managers must guarantee that this does not happen (Usmonovich, 2021). Secondly, an administrator’s role in the company is to get tasks completed through staff. In order to sustain desired objectives, thus, leaders need to be able to notice the decreasing engagement and improve staff morale. To comprehend motivation, one must first recognize fundamental human nature, which may be both complicated and straightforward at the same time (Usmonovich, 2021). Understanding and appreciating the above is a necessity for successful employee motivation in the workplace, as well as good management and organizational achievement. Thirdly, a business is less likely to fulfill its goals if its personnel is not entirely committed. When people lose interest in their employment, organizations will see a commensurate drop in determination, invention, and productivity. The leadership that declines to confront these issues immediately endangers their job, as the firm relies on them to guarantee that employees regularly perform at a high level (Usmonovich, 2021). Thus, managers must be familiar with motivational strategies as well as comprehend their workers’ unique peculiarities and views to select incentives that will effectively motivate them to work together to achieve the organization’s goals.",
    "This tote is perfect for mothers with teenage children who are constantly on the go but want to look stylish while doing errands and during family activities. It is high-end yet durable and keeps the owner’s personal belongings organized in a portable and secure way, making it easier to get outside in the shortest time. Product Selection According to the survey data, in the target audience, the most popular brands are Channel, Pucci, and Kate Shade. Therefore, the audience is torn between products in which the quality matches the price and luxury products with unreasonable prices. In order to justify the high-end price, it might be helpful to use a high-quality leather material and equip the bag with extra pockets for organized storage, as most luxury bags miss that feature. As survey results suggest that the target audience mostly prefers shoulder bags or tote bags, providing an additional shoulder strap will offer a more substantial basis for the price. Most survey participants have three to five bags, meaning that they prefer to have one bag that will suit all occasions, including everyday use, rather than a wide variety of different bags in different styles. Combining the collected conclusions leads to the black bag option in size 9×11 made from leather with 36$ production cost. Pricing The survey results suggest that most of the target audience can afford the price from 300$ to 700$, and most prefer to shop online for handbags. Considering the target audience’s income, it is more likely that a bag with a high mid-range price will be more popular as its price can be justified, unlike luxury bag prices. The closest alternative in mid-range price from All Tote Bags On Shelves research is Ralph Lauren Carlyle Mini Leather Zip Tote Bag with a 195$ pricing. Therefore, setting the future product’s price around 250$ will result in a fair price for the customers for the products’ quality. The price will also provide additional revenue for Buhi that the company can spend on additional accessories and product packaging to create a more luxurious feel.",
    "Marx’s thesis on the fetishism of commodities focuses on society’s tendency to place value on commodities based on contributed labor, which inevitably causes domination of the products over people. Furthermore, the fetishism affects the social interactions between the customer and producer: the valued objects are independently exchanged for the respective purposes. Such exchanges of objects occur independently of human needs or decisions (Ritzer, 2011). In this case, it is essential to note that the term fetishism does not suggest any sexual connotations; it only explains people’s inclination to devote themselves to the mentioned principles. In modern society, we have fetishized technological trends in the same way that Marx’s thesis suggests. For example, Apple products are known to be highly appreciated for their “high-quality” and “accessibility”. The labor that goes into creating the products, despite sometimes being considered unethical, benefits the brand’s overall image. Since hours and hundreds of workers are dedicated to producing the items, their values increase independently of their quality. The product’s value is then highly dependent on the importance placed by the general public and marketing strategies rather than its original worth. Moreover, the workers that are required for the brand’s success also become commodities, as mentioned in the Manifesto of the Communist Party (Marx & Engels, 1818-1883). In this way, although existing independently of one another, all major parts of the modern socio-economic system become disconnected from their actual worth. Marx’s thesis fails to explore how a commodity gains its value purely from the amount of labor included in the process. This could be outlined as a critical disadvantage to the thesis, as it ignores a central perspective that aid in changing the materialistic values of society. Another detail that was not mentioned in Marx’s work is related to the nature of commodities, why some are more valued than others. Still, the Manifesto of the Communist Party and Marx’s thesis provide a solid foundation for analyzing modern socio-economic relations.",
    "Mary Breckinridge was a strong individual who, despite all her suffering and terrible losses, dedicated her life to helping people and preventing others from experiencing the disasters that she had encountered. During her lifetime, she made a tremendous impact in the development of nursing and medical research. These are the reasons why I want to write about Mary Breckinridge and her achievements. Mary Breckinridge was born February 17, 1881, in Memphis, Tennessee, but raised in many places, including Kentucky, New York, and even St. Petersburg, since her father was a congressman and U.S Minister to Russia (Breckinridge, 2021). In 1904, after her first husband died, she decided to become a nurse (Breckinridge, 2021). Mary still tried to create a family afterward, and after ten years of nursing, she retired and gave birth to a son and a daughter from her second husband (Breckinridge, 2021). However, the tragedies continued to follow Mary, and her children died soon after the birth (Breckinridge, 2021). After the disasters, she left her husband and volunteered as a nurse in World War I, finally deciding to devote her life to saving lives (Breckinridge, 2021). After the war, Mary worked mainly in Kentucky and continued her education at the Teachers College of Columbia University in New York City (Breckinridge, 2021). In 1923, she went to England to study at the British Hospital for Mothers and Babies to become a qualified midwife (Breckinridge, 2021). Also, in 1925, she established a private charitable organization, the Frontier Nursing Service (FNC), which significantly decreased both maternal and infant mortality in the area of service (Brewer, 2018). During her life, Mary significantly contributed to nursing and helped many people. Apart from the FNC that still operates in southeastern Kentucky, she was recognized as the first who introduced nurse-midwifery to the United States (Brewer, 2018). It is worth mentioning that Mary’s impact on midwifery and nursing education continued even after her death. Today, people from around the world come to the FNC School of Midwifery and Family Nursing to study her model of rural health and social service delivery (Brewer, 2018). It is hard not to admire Mary Breckinridge for her contribution to nursing, despite all the tragedies she encountered. Even after losing her kids, Mary did not let the disaster break her spirit but devoted herself to reducing suffering from other people’s lives. I truly believe that everyone can learn from her example.",
    "The introduction of new levels of nursing education is a major reform that has contributed to the complexity of the field. Traditionally, nursing schools provided degrees of a Bachelor’s level associated with the basic skills required by this profession. However, today, aspiring nurses have access to high-quality Master’s programs that further develop their competencies. In this regard, a question may reasonably arise regarding the actual value of such degrees. In fact, Master’s programs in nursing are essential for healthcare, as they align with the growing importance of nurses and the contemporary view of the system. Bachelor’s degrees provide students with the basics of the profession, its fundamental concepts and practical skills. These aspects alone form a full-fledged, competent nurse who is capable of doing their job. In other words, a Bachelor’s degree cannot be considered an “incomplete” education in nursing. At the same time, Master’s programs serve as the development impetus for those who want to engage with more sophisticated principles of 21 st -century nursing. First of all, Master’s degrees are aimed at the manner in which nurses think. More specifically, such programs promote critical thinking and cognitive agility that is required to make precise decisions in difficult situations. Thus, a certain leadership dimension is introduced, allowing nurses to enter the healthcare decision-making framework while understanding the social dimension of the issues to address (Bryant-Moore et al., 2018). Second, a Master’s in nursing supports the development of emotional intelligence, which is integral to patient-centered care. By employing critical thinking, nurses learn to analyze each case objectively and master the emotional aspect that enables strong patient connection (Cassano et al., 2020). Third, a Master’s in nursing is a major step toward proficiency in scientific research, through which nurses help to build a better system for tomorrow. Overall, Master’s programs complement the fundamental skills of each professional by a stronger presence of cognitive, emotional, and research competencies that support the emergence of nursing leaders within the professional community.",
    "Mearsheimer justifies the reasons for Modern European war by the existence and disposition of poles of power, which affect the determination of states to engage in hostilities. He considers the multipolar system the most conducive to rivalry because states’ authority is not distributed evenly (Mearsheimer, 2014). Furthermore, it is most predisposed to instability, as relations between countries change from hostile to sociable and vice versa. Such frequent transformations contribute to the constant emergence of wars. Moreover, they prevent a rational assessment of the capabilities and intentions of adversaries. An unbalanced multipolarity is the most unbalanced form because it is characterized by a hegemon pursuing as much power as feasible. Other states are fearful of such urges, and therefore their policies can be more aggressive. Mearsheimer (2014) argues that wars in modern Europe under a bipolar order occurred with minimal frequency. This system is the most steady because there is a balance between the countries, contributing to their mutual understanding. However, Mearsheimer’s concept cannot be applied nowadays because it is challenging to define the current world order. It is evident that multipolarity prevails and establishes the course of action. Still, it is closely intertwined with bipolarity, which indicates that the modern world is a unique system with dissimilar approaches and impacts. This connection distinguishes the current state of the world structure from the previous one. Therefore, one cannot associate the reasons for military conflicts solely with a specific system. Mearsheimer’s ideas regarding the grounds for wars are rational and reasonable. Nevertheless, the author doubts them because of the nuclear weapon, which existed when Europe was bipolar (Mearsheimer, 2014). It was not present in multipolar order, and therefore the arguments are not valid as the atomic weapon is one of the world’s most significant forces. Mearsheimer (2014) suggested that it, not the system, could be the foremost reason for the absence of war in bipolar Europe between 1990 and 1945. The balance of power cannot affect the outbreak of war as much as the fear of nuclear annihilation.",
    "Melanoma is generally recognized as one of the cancers that have an increasing cover percentage, though it is usually diagnosed at early stages. Recently, the ways of melanoma treatment for patients with metastatic disease were so limited that many patients were practically doomed. Fortunately, melanoma therapeutics have developed for the past decade because of the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors. Now, people with stages II and III may easily have a long period of remission. Therefore, modern options for melanoma treatment serve as a source of hope for numerous people. Indeed, innovations in the sphere of melanoma treatment are connected with the use of checkpoint inhibitors and the so-called adjuvant therapy. According to recent research, “the use of anti–CTLA-4 and anti-PD1 immune checkpoint inhibitors and combination BRAF/MEK inhibitors for patients with BRAF V600 mutations has significantly extended survival and allowed some patients to remain in durable disease remission off therapy” (Poklepovic & Luke, 2019, p. 1166). This means that the so-called “low-risk” patients with stage IIA through IIC melanoma like Mr. B. from the question may have a long remission after receiving a special course. Still, patients in remission should better keep healthy with adjuvant therapies. A decade ago, such kind of additional treatment was frequently considered of marginal effects for earlier stage melanoma because of interferon-α2b (IFN). It turned out that “the substantial associated toxicity of that interferon and other treatments, such as the anti-CTLA4 antibody ipilimumab” (Jenkins & Fisher, 2021, p. 27). Therefore, it used to be of little trust for many efficient doctors. Moreover, as far as stage II is concerned, the lower incidence of disease progression calls for unprecedented efficacy (Rozeman et al., 2018). However, with time, adjuvant therapies became recognized in the sphere of cancer treatment. The case of Mr. B may be the one where adjuvant therapy could have prevented the biopsy from coming back to stage II melanoma.",
    "Although mentoring is a relatively new term within church circles, it has been practiced widely in Christian communities for years. Across many churches, spiritual coaching, directorship, discipleship, and friendship have been implemented in a mostly unstructured form, necessitating the need to formulate standard skills and methods for mentors for better outcomes. According to Mallison (1998), Christian coaching encompasses the development of disciples and leaders through sound instructions and encouragement, which are founded on God’s will and biblical teachings. The author defines Christian mentoring as “a dynamic, intentional relationship of trust in which one person enables another to maximize the grace of God in their life and service” (Mallison, 1998, p. 8). The author’s predominant theme is that mentorship is not optional if Christians intend to grow and the criticality of taking an interest in the progress of others. Christian-based mentoring integrates various spiritual components, aspects, and the bible as the principal ingredients. By presenting Jesus as the prime mentoring model, Mallison’s (1998) central premise is that Christians should be concerned in the spiritual and personal growth of others since Christianity is relational and collectivist. The author emphasizes the concepts of community and interdependence by describing “a Christian wanting to live in isolation as a pious particle” (Mallison, 1998, p. 34). However, the author’s notable refutation is that despite integrating all the critical ingredients and observing the foundational principles, Christian mentoring is futile if not underlined by a genuine desire to see the mentor advance spiritually. Mentorship and developing an interest in the spiritual and personal growth of others are indispensable if Christians are keen on growing deeper in their spirituality. For instance, Christian fellowships should allocate responsible and dependable persons to mentor new disciples due to their reliability and genuine concern for the mentees’ progress (Mallison, 1998). One of the publication’s key implications is the critical significance of a properly structured and biblically inspired coaching program. This implies that Christian mentorship models should generate disciples and leaders who then would continue propagating the gospel. Notable critiques in the book include the exclusive dependence on the bible as the source of information for analysis. Additionally, there is limited exploration of the relationship of spiritual friends and the spiritual directors with the mentors and the absent views on mentor damage. The author also accentuates his views by drawing comparisons from other works and the extensive integration of biblical insights. A question arising from the publication is how the Christian model of mentoring can remedy destructive coaching.",
    "The study of what rhetorical tools public personalities use in their speech can be a beneficial aspect to study. With its help, people can get an understanding of how, when, and where people can use rhetorical components. This work aims to study Michelle Obama’s opening remarks at the White House Convention on Food Marketing to Children. The main message of the First Lady was to draw attention to the suppression of the advertising of unhealthy food to minors. In addition, the main appeals that Obama uses are logic and emotional. The first aspect of rhetoric used in this speech is logic. It implies the justification and reasons for a particular action or event. Michele Obama stated that “between 2008 and 2011, obesity rates among low-income preschoolers dropped in 19 states and territories across the country” (Read Michelle Obama’s Speech on Food Marketing para. 10). Therefore, Obama provides a justification of how important it is for television changes to encourage a proper lifestyle among the younger generation. The next valuable component of rhetoric in the studied speech of the first lady is the emotional aspect. Thus, Obama emphasizes that “while we have made important progress, when one in three kids is still on track to develop diabetes, and when the diet has now surpassed smoking” (Read Michelle Obama’s Speech on Food Marketing para. 11). In this case, Michele Obama points to the positive results already achieved while also highlighting that children are still at risk. In conclusion, this work was engaged in analyzing Michelle Obama’s speech on the topic of the harm of the media for introducing the younger generation to healthy habits. To better convey the main idea, the first lady used such components of rhetoric as logic and emotion. They helped to better form and give important information, gave the speech solidity, and improved the audience’s ability to persuade.",
    "Globalization has indeed become a significant pattern in the development of geopolitical and cultural practices of recent decades. With the advent of the Internet, people have become connected, even across continents: such a powerful catalyst could not fail to have a necessary consequence. In particular, people from different countries and cultures have become more integrated into a common, emerging culture in which there is room for the traditions of all peoples. Meanwhile, the representation of different cultures in this common one is unequal, which means that stronger national cultures can absorb weaker ones. A natural reaction to the unification of people was the growth of nationalistic sentiments among peoples whose cultures tend to be weaker. Thus, the spread of American sentiment (and especially the American dream) to the world often results in people from other regions becoming indifferent to their culture. In addition, globalization can lead to the destruction of the sovereignty of vulnerable communities: for example, if the big powers (the United States, China, Russia, Britain) suppress the development of small neighboring ones (Hawaii, Hong Kong, Abkhazia, or former British colonies). Healthy nationalism is not a problem because communities desire to protect themselves and preserve their cultural and political independence. However, radical, violent actions on the part of nationalists lead to international conflicts and inhibit globalization. Thus, globalization should not be evaluated regarding whether it is good or bad. Instead, it should be seen as a natural milestone in the evolution of humanity. Globalization does have advantages and disadvantages, but it is a fact in and of itself. The world now finds itself incredibly integrated, as every individual can learn news from another continent, listen to foreign music, and read non-domestic literature in a matter of minutes. This results in a new, shared culture. In this state, radical nationalism is a serious problem that society and governments must confront.",
    "There is no simple answer to what it means to be human. Some might say that being human means being independent and controlling their personal lives. For other people, being human means utilizing the refinements of civilization, wearing clothes, and going to work every day, i.e., doing everything that animals cannot do. It is also complicated to say how people want to live because everyone has unique requirements, dreams, and thoughts on this issue. This essay reflects on the On Being podcast and answers the above questions. In the podcast, Thich Nhat Hanh explains why people need to be human. According to him, “we have to remain human to be able to understand and to be compassionate” (Onbeing.org 30:53 – 30:58). The monk adds that being human means having a right to make mistakes, but the absence of a “right to continue making mistakes” (Onbeing.org 31:15 – 31:20). Therefore, being human means being mindful, responsible, and open-hearted. In other words, being human is about being humane. People live in a world of violence and terror and cannot even talk to each other effectively (Onbeing.org). Consequently, they fail to understand which way of living is genuine. From the words of Thich Nhat Hanh, it could be inferred that people want to live without anger; they want to live mindfully and be in control of their emotions. Nonetheless, an average modern person could hardly achieve this way of living. Overall, the podcast is immensely inspiring since it is dedicated to being human, problems people face in the modern mad world, and ways to avoid them. The Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh creates an impression of a conscious person whose ideas should be taken seriously. Even though I do not share the Buddhist worldview, I deeply admire the personality of Thich Nhat Hanh since he inspired me to learn more about mindfulness practices.",
    "“The Passing of Traditional Societies” is based on empirical material obtained from fieldwork and interviews conducted over a decade in Turkey, Lebanon, Syria, Egypt, Jordan, and Iran. Lerner proceeded from the fact that in the process of modernization, all societies move in the same direction, which was set by the Western countries that had completed modernization earlier. However, this “Western model,” according to Lerner, is, in fact, global. It acquired its name only due to a historical confluence of circumstances. Countries of the North Atlantic were the first to carry out the processes of secularization, urbanization, and industrialization. Analyzing the modernization of lifestyles based on empirical material, Lerner pays the most attention to the growth of population mobility, the spread of literacy, and the mass media. For example, Lerner dwelled on the problem of restrictions for modernization. Among the most critical factors hindering development, he attributed ethnocentrism. Lerner states, “From the West came the stimuli which undermined traditional society in the Middle East; for the reconstruction of a modern society that will operate efficiently” (Lerner 47). The author contrasts societies, at the same time declaring that the focus on cultural identity impedes progress. I believe that this concept of modernization designed to solve the problems of transition from “backwardness” to “modernity” was a specific product of the era after the Second World War. Built on numerous simplifications, the modernization theory interprets the historical process as one-line and non-alternative (Dunmire 23). The paradigm proposed by Lerner does not explain the development principles of many countries, such as China, Russia, or Cuba, and therefore loses its relevance in modern days.",
    "The clothing industry is amongst the many monopolistically competitive industries. There are many clothing firms in the industry competing against each other while producing similar products. However, the firms in the industry earn competitive advantages by distinguishing their products through branding and advertisements (Davis and Özgür, 4). Product differentiation is one of the strategies commonly used by monopolistic competitive firms. Product differentiation in a clothing firm can involve designs, the quality of materials used, and the prices charged for the clothes. In advertisements, differentiation is put in physical aspects such as color, designs, elastic, and different sizes (Davis and Özgür, 7). Intangible aspects included in the clothing advertisement can be guaranteed money back, high quality, free delivery, and long-lasting usage. Steel manufacturing is an example of an oligopolistic competitive industry. In such a market, a few steel manufacturing companies rule over other firms. The few firms are the price and trendsetters for other small companies and often form a partnership to operate successfully (Ritz 185). To distinguish themselves from their competitors, they improve their product quality, hike or lower prices, and advertise the special features of their products. In an oligopolistic market, if a leading company lowers prices, the others do not follow but rather improve their products to remain in the higher cuts of prices (Ritz 187). The few leading companies also stay competitive in the industry by setting their standards high to prevent easy entry into the industry. The firms set high standards by producing the highest quality products, selling them at a higher price, and producing them in high quantities (Ritz 189). That way, they ensure that the small or new companies fear the competition at the top thus ensuring reduced entry to the industry.",
    "Moral relativism claims that morality is not based on any absolute standard. According to moral relativism, ethical truth is more likely to come from situations, cultures, and sensations. The source of moral universalism is considered human nature, particularly the susceptibility of a person, the ability to empathize, and the resulting need for argumentation for persuasion. The two moral concepts are opposed, but moral universalism seems to be more truthful. Several arguments can be made concerning moral relativism that reflect a dubious nature. Firstly, while many of the arguments that insist on supporting relativism may seem compelling, they all have a logical contradiction in that they all return the correct moral schema that all people should follow, which constitutes moral universalism. Secondly, relativists may argue that different cultures have different values and that morality is relative to different people. However, these arguments explain people’s actions in terms of absolute standards, so it converges back to moral universalism. Moral universalism presupposes the existence of an ethical system that effectively regulates the behavior of members of any community, regardless of culture, race, gender, religion, nationality, sexual orientation, or any other distinguishing features. The simplest justification for this point of view is the obvious observation that in all known moral codes that have proven their viability, there is a common core: respect for life, health, property, and personal dignity. Moral universalism seems to be the more truthful theory. Firstly, moral relativism is built on exceptions, not on general rules. All people approach morality from human nature, which explains approximately the same moral and ethical codes of all countries and peoples. Moral norms are considered basic everywhere, for example, the prohibition of murder. Secondly, if everyone had their own morality and ethics, as moral relativism suggests, it would be impossible to regulate human relations.",
    "“Interpreter of Maladies” introduces the reader to a collapsing world of a dysfunctional family. In the novel, Mr. Das sparks both sympathy and a sense of slight annoyance that is likely to transform into disdain after considering the evolution of his character. Although the character might seem benevolent and sympathetic at first, his evident inability to emotionally connect with his wife or children indicates the need for further evolution, which never occurs. At first glance, Mr. Das represents a character that is easy to empathize with and relate to due to his kind nature. Indeed, Mr. Das is mostly benevolent and kind-hearted throughout the novel. For example, he is never aggressive or unkind to his wife, her mostly being the one to start a confrontation: “’But they’re harmless,’ Mr. Das said” (Lahiri). However, Mr. Das should not be seen as immediately redeemable. Specifically, on a closer look, Mr. Das’ unwillingness to interact with his wife or children becomes evident. For instance, when Mr. Kapasi starts talking to the couple., Mr. Das chooses to avoid the conversation. Namely, he chooses to read a book instead: “Mr. Das was absorbed by his tour book, so it seemed like a private conversation between Mr. Kapasi and Mrs. Das” (Lahiri). Therefore, Mr. Das clearly distances himself from his wife and, by extension, from his children, creating a further rift in their relationship. Therefore, the failure to acknowledge and address a problem represents a major obstacle in Mr. Das’ character development. as a result, he never grows throughout the novel, remaining in the same infant state of blissful ignorance. Thus, his intentionally turning a blind eye to the unhappiness of his family members makes him not as sympathetic as he might have seemed at first. Failing miserably to notice the presence of alienation between him and his wife, as well as his children, Mr. Das elicits emotions that gradually deny the reader the expected empathy and, instead, see him as desperately flawed. Even though the problems in Mr. Das’ perception of his marriage and his children are quite understandable, humanizing him and making him relatable, his inability, or unwillingness, to recognize the problem and tackle it leads to the reader’s bitter disappointment. Thus, with his complexity and contradictory nature, Mr. Das and his character arc teach the reader an important lesson about the need for introspection and acknowledging reality.",
    "The article represents an overview of other literature on methodologies and criteria used in supplier evaluation and selection process, which is believed to be one of the vital components of a successful operation of a manufacturing company. In particular, the paper emphasized the industry’s change in this field – from focusing primarily on operational efficiency to embracing the potential of strategic partnerships. The article claims that the right approach to supplier assessment, thus, is the key to a company’s development and progress. The paper starts with various ways to address the issues related to MCDM of suppliers’ selection. The most common ones are stated to be mathematical models, Simple multi-attribute rating technique (SMART), analytic network process (ANP), analytic hierarchy process (AHP), data envelopment analysis (DEA), linear programming, and some others. For example, DEA is a methodology focused on a supplier system and classifies it either as efficient or inefficient based on selecting particular criteria. Mathematical programming models usually incorporate complex evaluations between suppliers, allowing one to compare them and identify the most optimal in terms of cost and other criteria. The article further compares all methodologies by their popularity expressed in the frequency of mentions in the literature. Thus, DEA is the most common approach with 30% mentions, whereas mathematical programming (17%), AHP (15%), and case-based reasoning account for fewer mentions. However, those methodologies represent the largest share of all MCDM approaches. The article highlights the significance of knowing this distribution, which can build an idea of the most prominent ways to address the issues with suppliers’ assessment and selection. It is also stated that suppliers should be evaluated based on “the inputs of the strategic, functional and operational levels” (Agarwal et al., 2011). Methodologies such as DEA, mathematical programming, or AHP are advised to be used for identifying the most optimal suppliers, whereas AHP is noted to be effective in providing consistency.",
    "Ancient Rome could be described as multicultural, largely due to the significant areas of land that the Roman Empire controlled at various points, often integrating the local populations and cultures into their own. A wide variety of cultures existed within the borders of the Roman civilization and the Roman population was found to have incredible genetic diversity, having more in common with the Mediterranean states rather than Western Europe (Thomsen, 2019). Some of the cultures that were present under Roman rule include the Gauls, Greeks, Syrian, Egyptian, Lebanese, Persia, and many others. Scholars attribute the cultural and economic success of Rome partially to its ability to embrace a range of ethnic and national identities, often assimilating many elements of the foreign cultures into its own traditions, beliefs or practices. The well-known Pax Romana , a period of prosperity and tranquility for approximately 200 years came at a point when Roman conquests came to a relative end, and a range of cultures were given the opportunity to live in harmony under one central government. While as all Empires, Rome did push some values and requirements upon the regions it conquered, for the most part, the people could live their lives, worship their respective religions, follow their respective traditions, and even maintain their own laws and taxation (Brooks, 2019). Rome by far was one of the most multicultural states in the ancient world that greatly respected the civilizations of others. The primary culture that strongly influenced the Roman culture is likely Ancient Greece. The Hellenistic society led the basis to much what is Roman, ranging from architecture to art to philosophy and politics. The Romans greatly respected the Greeks for their progress and intelligence, and sought to build upon that foundation in the prosperity of their empire including in the aspects of science, literature, law, economics, and even military tactics. Furthermore, the Romans were influenced by the Etruscans, a neighboring tribe to the northwest of Rome, who were allied with and then conquering the newly formed city-state. Etruscans were heavy traders with the Greeks, and had a similarly loose empire of city states, sharing many of the cultural elements. Essentially, the Etruscans allowed for the Greek culture to transition into Rome (Brooks, 2019). However, Rome was influenced by the Etruscans in its early days by contributing to its military capabilities and war-oriented, expansionist society.",
    "From ancient ages, humans have used symbols and myths to express their experience of a reality that transcends the physical world and transmits it to future generations. Nowadays, famous brands apply mythology to successful products due to their magical power. The logo of the house of Versace is a very extravagant and extraordinary mark; it was designed in 1978 by Gianni Versace. The logo represents the head of the ancient Greek mythology of Medusa Gorgon. The designer explained why he chose this character; it is a synthesis of beauty and simplicity, which is able to mesmerize anyone, just like the clothes produced by the brand. Other examples are Lamborghini; first, the Italian company was engaged in the production of tractors. The bull became the emblem of the brand, as the bull is the sacred animal of Zeus. According to some people, this animal is extremely hardy and strong, which endows the brand with great power. Now, Lamborghini cars are high-performance, expensive supercars, and the emblem of the golden bull is very appropriate for them. I prefer the myth of Prometheus because evil never prevails, and goodness and justice win. The mighty titan Prometheus stole the sacred fire from Olympus to provide it for humankind. He made humanity independent of the gods. Prometheus trained people to write, count, crafts and introduced them to metals. Before, people were afraid of the elements of the sea, but now the titan taught them how to build ships; humans became proficient in the art of medicine (Travis, 2021). Prometheus was destroying people’s faith in the deity, and for this, the thunderer Zeus decided to punish him. Prometheus was chained to a rock, the sunburned him mercilessly, and the rain was pounding him. However, this was not the end of the titan’s torment; a giant eagle sat on Prometheus’s chest every day and tore his liver (Travis, 2021). Heracles, the strongest men, killed the eagle that tortured Prometheus, broke Prometheus’ chains, and the titan was free.",
    "McDonald’s filed a lawsuit in the United States against its former CEO, Steve Easterbrook, after it was revealed that he had several consensual sexual encounters with workers in the year before his leave and maintained them hidden. Easterbrook misled authorities and threw away proof of his wrongdoing; he prioritized his interests over McDonald’s. Shareholders have filed a lawsuit against the corporation for attempting to prevent misbehavior and prioritizing speed over accuracy in resolving the issue. Negligent recruitment and retention responsibility are widely used to describe an employer’s commitment not to recruit or keep a worker (Monteiro et al., 2019). The supervisor was aware of or should have been aware of the likelihood of engaging in behavior against other persons or otherwise subjecting workers or third parties to legal responsibility. Companies can be held accountable for their workers’ intentional misbehavior (dos Santos et al., 2017). This work is written to study the case of negligence at work since negligence is the most common type of tort. If a McDonald’s fails to vet a worker before hiring them thoroughly and they cause harm to others, the corporation may be held accountable for their conduct. A McDonald’s, for instance, should examine all prior work, certification qualifications, and current professional associations before hiring an executive chef (Rushchenko et al., 2020). If the chef commits frequent culinary errors that cause health concerns for diners, the popular fast food restaurant is likely to be held accountable since it failed to do a basic employment background check. This is one of the reasons why criminal history checks are required. If a person strikes colleagues and consumers and can demonstrate that a criminal history check revealed past violent conduct, the business may be held liable. Assume an employer knows an employee’s risky, unpredictable, or disrespectful behavior but does not fire the worker. In that instance, McDonald’s might be held accountable for ensuring the safety of others.",
    "When it comes to people I find most fascinating and interesting, Neil deGrasse Tyson is one of them. This man is a famous astrophysicist and planetary scientist who shares his opinions and knowledge on various platforms. Personally, I find the pieces of information he provides mind-opening and shocking at times. I believe that this person knows a lot of controversial information and has various opinions on such matters, which would be pretty interesting to know. Neil deGrasse Tyson was born in 1958 and received several degrees from various universities, including Harvard, the University of Texas at Austin, and Columbia University (Tyson). Additionally, in early 2000, he was appointed by the president to serve on the Commission on the Future of the United States Aerospace Industry (Culp). I am a person who has always been fond of the vast and mysterious cosmos. I have watched a lot of documentaries that shed light on the peculiarities of universes, galaxies, and planets. Among those documentaries was Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey, narrated by Neil deGrasse Tyson. I believe that the knowledge of this astrophysicist stretches far beyond the information narrated in the documentary. If I had a chance to talk to this person, I would definitely ask him questions about extraterrestrial life. I have always found it perplexing that our planet is the only planet that has life, and I wonder if Tyson has any theories on this matter. I would also like to ask him whether he knows about any classified information at NASA. Hence, Neil deGrasse Tyson is one of the fascinating people to me. His knowledge and experience inspire me, and I would love to have a chance to talk to him in real life. From this experience, I would like to gain new perceptions and theories on the cosmos and information about outer space, something not commonly discussed. I think this person has more information and opinions to share.",
    "It is important to note that brain tissue is among the most complex and intricate structures of the human body, which has a highly limited capacity for healing and regeneration. The topic of the proposed research is to assess how neural stem cells replace and differentiate into neurons and other cells of the brain in order to use them for therapeutic purposes. N eural stems cells must be used as a therapeutic measure to slow or halt the aging process due to their rejuvenation and differentiation capabilities. Organization Plan  1. Introduction.  2. Literature Review.  3. Brain Aging.  4. Neural Stem Cell Differentiation.  5. Differentiation Regulation.  6. Therapeutic Approaches.  7. Discussion.  8. Conclusion. Literature Review Part 1 The preliminary research suggests that there is a complex system of regulatory steps that involve GABA signaling. There is an array of signaling molecules involved in the ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ) neurogenesis, such as Sonic hedgehog, fibroblast growth factor 2, glutamate, and others. The subgranular zone (SGZ) is another important germinal region of the adult human brain, and the mechanisms of regulations are comparatively different between V-SVZ and SGZ. Part 2 For example, a key source of the proposal states that “V-SVZ NSCs are regulated by local signals from their immediate neighbors, as well as by neurotransmitters and factors that are secreted by distant neurons, the choroid plexus, and vasculature” (Obernier & Alvarez-Buylla, 2019, p. 1). In other words, distantly located cells secrete a wide range of signaling molecules to regulate the neural stem cell generation, differentiation, and regeneration processes.

    "The two American regions to be first settled by the English colonists were New England and the Chesapeake Bay. In the Chesapeake Bay, the colonists arrived under the auspices of Virginia Company – a joint-stock enterprise dedicated to colonizing America for profit. Although the early hopes of finding precious metals did not materialize, the region eventually found its economic specialization in growing tobacco (Corbett et al., 2022). The company hired the English poor for the labor-intensive task of growing the colony and producing tobacco, and most of the newcomers were young single males (Corbett et al., 2022). Conversely, the New England colonies followed a different settlement pattern. Unlike the Chesapeake Bay, they were shaped not by the pursuit of profit but by the desire to escape persecution and perceived moral decadence of England and create a virtuous society (Corbett et al., 2022). New Englanders came to America as entire families and, unlike the Chesapeake Bay colonists, established a largely self-sustaining economy of farms, hamlets, and commercial enterprises rather than cash crop plantations (Corbett et al., 2022). Such were the differences in settlement patterns and shaping forces between the two. Religion played a considerable role in both regions, although in the shape of different denominations. The founders of New England colonies established their settlements with an explicitly religious purpose of creating a perfect Protestant community, which was the case in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and other colonies as well (Corbett et al., 2022). Interestingly enough, although the Chesapeake Bay colonies were business enterprises intended primarily for profit, the Anglican Church also played a considerable role in their life. For them, proselytism was a means to establish better relations with the Native Americans, as in John Rolf’s famous marriage to Pocahontas (Tsukada, 2020). Thus, both Protestant and Anglican denominations played their role in the colonization of New England and the Chesapeake Bay, respectively.",
    "A new creation that has recently entered the market is the electric scooter. It quickly gained popularity because it allowed people to rush from one part of the city to another. At the same time, people spent less time because they were not stuck in traffic lights (Hagiu and Wright 1527). Its competitive advantage, though, is that it does not harm the natural environment and requires less energy for maintenance. That is, such scooters use little energy resources to operate and therefore are better than a car (Hagiu and Wright 1527). It should be noted that some electric scooters can be charged by the sun accordingly; it can be described as an uncomplicated device for a low price, which enables to move quickly. Thus, the above advantages contribute to the fact that people are increasingly choosing electric scooters; consequently, they have gained popularity in the market in a short time. A product that will expand gradually in the market is wireless headphones. It is becoming popular because every phone manufacturer is trying to produce such an accessory. At the same time, the competitive advantage is that they are small and comfortable to use (Hagiu and Wright 1527). Although their price is higher than ordinary headphones, they work longer and do not break as quickly. They have gained a stronger position in the market because of the fact that they directly attach to phones at a distance, which is convenient in today’s world. Moreover, people who buy the phone also choose headphones from their company (Hagiu and Wright 1527). Thus, the benefits listed above contribute to the number of types of wireless headphones on the market and their popularity.",
    "With the current broad variety of species, as well as the emergent news about the species that are on the verge of extinction due to the impact of the changes in the environment, one might believe that discovering new animals is no longer a possibility. However, new species are still discovered regularly, the recent incredible find being an example of that. Namely, the Nimba myotis, also known as the fuzzy orange bat, or Myotis nimbaensis, has been identified as a new species this year (Simmons et al., 2021). Having orange fur with black pigmentation, Nimba Myotis represents a rather unusual specimen of bats. The animal prefers natural caves as the place where it lives and rests. Like other bats, Nimba Myotis uses laryngeal echolocation as the means of identifying and catching prey in the dark. However, due to the species in question being under researched, its diet is mostly unknown (Simmons et al., 2021). Overall, the bat represents a unique specimen in its class. The species belongs to the animal kingdom, particularly, to mammals of the Chiroptera order and the Vespertilionidae family (Simmons et al., 2021). The main rationale for placing it in the animal kingdom is the fact that Nimba Myotis is a mammal. Additionally, the specified species reproduces sexually, unlike members of other kingdoms, and is multicellular (Simmons et al., 2021). Furthermore, the fact that cells in Nimba Myotis do not have cell walls, allows classifying it with other species in the Animal kingdom. Therefore, the bat should be defined as an animal, particularly, a mammal. Furthermore, one should note that, being a bat, Nimba Myotis represents the largest order in the mammal class after rodents (Simmons et al., 2021). Overall, the discovery of Nimba Myotis has shed a lot of light on the species of bats, in general.",
    "There are many different species of marine microbes that exist in the water in massive amounts. Among the Nitrite oxidizing bacteria, there are six main types: Nitrotoga, Nitrospira, Nitrolancetus, Nitrospina, Nitrobacter, and Nitrococcus (Han 2). One of the fascinating species of bacteria is Nitrobacter which plays a crucial role in the nutrition of plants. Since this is a nitrifying bacterium, it serves as a simple way to release nitrogen that comes out of plants. Therefore, this paper aims to analyze the essence of the Nitrobacter, its specific characteristics its position in the ecosystem. Nitrobacter is the most interesting among the other species because it participates in converting nitrite to nitrates. Nitrification happens due to the receiving of nitrates from ammonia by oxidation, and the process goes with the help of the pair of bacteria, which are Nitrobacter and Nitrosomonas (Han 3). First of all, it is crucial to mention the concept of nitrification and the operations that are included there in order. Since the process is happening in the soil, it is a remarkable biological phenomenon that may also influence the other factors connected with nature. The nitrogen cycle is a significant part of the biological processes, and bacteria that exist in the soil take part in the majority of chemical phases that produce atmospheric nitrogen into the new condition. Overall, Nitrobacter is an integral part of maintaining the diversity of the microorganism in the soil that is provided by its oxidation activity. It plays a critical role in the plants’ nutrition and, as a nitrifying bacterium, makes it possible for the soil to preserve the auspicious condition and maintain its fertility. Thus, due to those reasons, Nitrobacter is an exceptionally fascinating species of Nitrite oxidizing bacteria.",
    "Millions of people worldwide suffer from mental disorders: manias, phobias, and panic attacks exhaust and torment a lot of individuals. One of the widespread, long-lasting mental ailments is an obsessive-compulsive disorder or OCD, which consists of obsessive thoughts and compulsive behavior that are almost impossible to control. The analysis of this disorder due to the four D diagnostic indicators can let us explore it more profoundly and thoroughly.   * Distress: OCD often makes individuals feel abnormal when they are forced to fight the terrible thoughts torturing their heads and repeat meaningless acts intended to decrease anxiety. In addition, having “unwanted, recurrent and persistent images or impulses that evoke anxiety or extreme distress” and realizing “the unreasonable nature of symptoms” people cannot stop them (Van Leeuwen et al., 2020, p. 1-2). They become nervous and depressed: therefore, the level of distress is high and complicates the person’s life.   * Dysfunction: This disorder significantly influences the daily life of a patient. Firstly, obsessive thoughts often interfere with the usual people’s acts and cause a surge of panic, disturbing to complete their work. Sometimes, “cognitive biases cause dysfunctional beliefs” (Van Leeuwen et al., 2020, p. 2). Secondly, compulsive actions interrupt a patient’s daily routine, forcing them to do specific steps a certain number of times. Such activities can last even for an hour or more: therefore, the extent of dysfunction is also noticeable.   * Danger: OCD may represent a significant danger for an individual since sometimes, people feel so depressed that they are ready to commit suicide. In addition, sometimes, they may try to defeat their obsessive thoughts, causing self-pain: for instance, they can strike themselves to get rid of the unwanted image. However, although one of the most widespread fears of people with OCD is to harm others, they rarely do it (O’Connor & Aude, 2019). Thus, the level of danger to self is significantly higher than that of danger to others.   * Deviance: Since OCD causes abnormal thoughts and behavior, people with such a disorder can be characterized as deviant. However, it would be wrong to claim that it is easy to “determine the degree of deviation from the norm” (Davis, 2009, p. 1). OCD causes anxiety, stress, and panic; it makes people live in fear that if they do not do specific actions, they will not be able to avoid danger. Therefore, an individual should visit a clinic and let specialists help them fight.",

    "In the survey The Effect Of Work Relationships On Organizational Culture And Commitment, as many as 89% of respondents confirmed that communication with colleagues affects the quality of life (Suhardi, 2020). It also turned out that if a person has at least one friend at work, it connects him more strongly with the company and supports his desire to stay in this place. Feeling connected to other people supports employees’ interest and involvement in work. Talking to colleagues, a person gradually gets rid of the fear of expressing their ideas and comments. Scientists from the University of Michigan conducted an interesting experiment, Friends (and Sometimes Enemies) With Cognitive Benefits: What Types of Social Interactions Boost Executive Functioning? The participants were divided into two groups: first, the first group subjects had to get to know each other for 10 minutes. And the second group was asked to participate in disputes among themselves on a certain topic. Then all the subjects were asked to solve several cognitive tasks. The experiment participants from the first group, who had previously just communicated in a relaxed atmosphere, showed the best results in solving problems. They had significant improvements in the executive functions of the brain. These processes are responsible for planning, concentration, prioritization, and organization. In other words, for the skills and qualities that we need to work.",
    "Osteoarthritis is a disease that affects people all over the world, but is frequently mishandled within the healthcare system. It is one of the most common causes of disability in older persons, resulting in pain, loss of function, and a lower quality of life. On a societal level, the condition is predicted to cost $303 billion in medical bills and lost wages each year (Abramoff & Caldera, 2020). This chronic, severe disease requires continued efforts to limit its incidence, pain, and loss of function. Osteoarthritis is known for its degenerative effects on articular cartilage, which becomes significantly damaged over time. The smooth cartilage at the ends of long bones and within the intervertebral discs is known as articular cartilage. It provides a low-friction articulation surface while being able to transmit large loads. Even while the collagen in cartilage has a lengthy half-life, it repairs slowly, if at all, even with slight injuries. Although the cartilage transforms the most, the entire joint, including the synovium, joint ligaments, and subchondral bone, is impacted. Osteoarthritis is often overlooked, despite its significant personal, economic, and societal costs. Even though osteoarthritis frequently coexists with heart disease, diabetes, and mental health issues, and can aggravate the morbidity and mortality associated with these ailments, it is not included in worldwide strategic plans for noncommunicable diseases. Patients and practitioners may be affected by therapeutic nihilism, with misconceptions that osteoarthritis is an unavoidable component of aging and that there are no viable therapies (Abramoff & Caldera, 2020). The affected people are frequently misinformed about treatment options. Current health-care approaches can range from ignoring essential treatments like exercise, weight loss, and education to using expensive, unproven medications for late-stage disease. I find this issue to be the most interesting, although unfortunate, element of both the article and the condition’s perception. I believe that rehabilitation counselling could combine physical and psychological aid to help patients with osteoarthritis and its various consequences.",
    "Outreach Chicago is an organization providing help and services to homeless people and those underserved by already existing incorporations. The company’s main mission is to provide help and necessities to humans for their subsequent successful reintegration into society. To practice deductive reasoning, it is essential to start by formulating a general hypothesis or statement that Outreach Chicago provides help to people (Adler & Clark, 2015). The observation allows us to find evidence for the statement as Outreach Chicago serves meals and distributes hygiene kits, coats, blankets, socks, and undergarments to people in need. The company’s official site provides precise numbers of each aid type, so one can conclude that the company indeed provides help with various necessities since 2011 to people in need. Outreach Chicago states the average poverty rate in its area of performance is 34% among adults and 51% among children (Outreach Chicago, 2022). To practice inductive reasoning, it might be useful to compare data stated by the company with the other statistical sources regarding poverty rates, checking the modernity of the information it proposes to the readers. The company works in several locations: Chicago Heights, Chicago, Cicero, Dolton, and Harvey (Outreach Chicago, 2022). The estimations, according to the site Welfare Info, relate to the following poverty rates among adults in 2017 26.4%, 20.6%, 19.8%, 26.6%, and 35.6% respectively (Poverty Illinois, 2022). The calculated average of these areas is 25.8% which means the company was either gathering data from previous years or referring to the numbers of the poorest city, Harvey. A question for qualitative research can be if the services provided by Outreach Chicago meet the requirements of the customers. This research can interview customers and assess the impression of service, and the use of the goods it supplies. The study hypothesizes that Outreach Chicago provides essential supplies for its clients. The results of the research could be used for better service providing as customers can give feedback on some items that are not necessary or could be changed. For the quantitative study, the question is if the general satisfaction level of the clients is above 50%. To estimate satisfaction, the clients will be given application forms to fill in. The research hypothesizes that Outreach Chicago meets the expectations of the customers by more than 50%. The research can help the organization receive information about the effectiveness of its performance.",
    "Overpopulation in cities has become one of the most critical problems of our time. This is both an environmental and a social problem. The city cannot grow indefinitely and provide decent workplaces for every resident. The ecological burden is also increasing. Uncontrolled growth in the number of cities leads to the unchecked spread of pollution and the escalation of poverty. However, there are several preventive measures that the Government can implement to combat this problem. First of all, overpopulation in cities is congestion and traffic jams, which lead to serious pollution problems. Atmospheric pollution is the most serious in cities, and its primary source is road transport, which emits sulfur dioxide and nitrogen into the air in huge quantities. The second main problem is poverty: disadvantaged groups in rural areas live in poverty (Innes et al., 2019). Some of them decide to settle in the city because they believe that they can easily find work. Their main goal is to provide for their family, but almost none have the necessary education for a good job. These people come to the city and become a service class. They suffer from the prejudice of indigenous people, poverty, and worse working conditions. Another inconvenience due to overcrowding is the garbage from residents, which is difficult to dispose of (Namberger et al., 2019). In many European countries, this problem is solved thanks to separate garbage collection (even in houses, there are separate garbage cans). Then some of the garbage is recycled, some are incinerated at incinerators. In conclusion, to solve traffic and air pollution problems, people should use public transport as often as possible, rather than using their car. The government should build more roads and improve public transport to solve this problem. Poverty is now lower than at any time in human history, and all trends demonstrate that we will have consistent successes in the fight against poverty in the foreseeable future.",
    "The Balboa is Panama’s national currency, named after Spanish explorer Vasco Nez de Balboa, who encountered the Pacific Ocean. One Balboa represents one U.S. Dollar, and the U.S. Dollar has been lawfully exchanged in Panama since then. As a result, Panama is regarded a highly inflationary country; however, Panama can profit from the U.S. dollar’s resilience as the foundation of the world banking markets. For example, this implies that Panama will not face hyperinflation as a consequence of shifting exchange rates. Consequently, Panama has become a more attractive investment and tourist destination. Nevertheless, a dollarized system has outstanding inflation performances and may even lessen the influence of global trust shocks but not real external upsets (Bakari & Mabrouki, 2017). Furthermore, it is unclear whether Panama’s loose monetary policy resulted from the dollarization system or the competing, increasingly globalized banking sector. Panama’s geographic position as a key maritime route adds to the significance of the Agreement. Approximately two-thirds of the Panama Canal’s yearly transits are destined to or from U.S. locations (Park et al., 2020). Almost all U.S. automotive and commercial goods shipments to Panama will be duty-free initially, with residual levies phased away over a ten-year period (Park et al., 2020). Information systems gear, farming, large machinery, aircraft and components, healthcare and measure environmental, ecological products, medicines, fertilizer, and agrochemicals are among the U.S. items that will benefit from immediate duty-free accessibility. The U.S. and Panama exchange crops like corn and bananas if we talk about exports and imports."

    "Russia's recent attack on Ukraine has caused widespread devastation, with Ukraine's forces bravely resisting the assault. The conflict is escalating, leading to more violence. This could be the largest military invasion in Europe in years. Many people have been forced to flee their homes, seeking refuge in neighboring countries. Gunfire and artillery strikes have targeted residential areas in Ukraine, with media outlets covering and sharing the news worldwide. The New York Times and Le Monde have reported on the events in Ukraine, each offering a different perspective and using varying language to describe the same incidents.

One notable feature is the separation of officers, directors, and shareholders - officers are responsible for day-to-day operations, while directors oversee them and can remove officers if necessary. Shareholders have the flexibility to transfer ownership, enabling potential sales in situations like bankruptcy. Unlike limited liability companies (LLCs), corporations offer investors profit opportunities. However, corporations face double taxation on income, first at the corporate level and again if dividends are distributed to shareholders. In summary, CSC functions as a corporation with various subsidiaries and adheres to the characteristics of this business form. Notably, the board of directors indirectly influences daily decisions and can appoint new officers in crucial circumstances, showcasing the balance of power within corporations.",
    "A medical office worker's job involves a mix of administrative tasks and medical duties. These professionals primarily serve as office assistants who deal with paperwork and staff interactions. For upcoming job interviews, I plan to maintain a professional business appearance with appropriate attire. Despite the potential high cost of a suitable suit, I already own the necessary formal clothing in the form of a black suit, shoes, and minimal accessories. I can wear this outfit comfortably during warm weather and layer with outerwear like an overcoat in colder seasons. While work attire may require additional investments, healthcare workers, including office staff, typically wear scrubs, which are affordable and can be purchased online for around $20-$40. It is crucial to invest in good closed-toe shoes as these professionals often have to stand or walk extensively. In some cases, medical institutions provide uniforms as part of their consumables, potentially eliminating the need for personal purchases. Considering these factors, budgetary implications for clothing will likely have minimal impact on my overall financial plan. By setting aside $200 for potential expenses and being mentally prepared to address any specific requirements during interviews, I can navigate this aspect with ease. Ultimately, I am well-prepared for clothing requirements for both interviews and work, ensuring a smooth transition into the medical office environment.",
    "In analyzing the mother complex, Carl Jung unveils a deep-rooted sense of care that forms the emotional bond between a mother and child at its core. When this bond is absent, an archetype emerges, signaling a mother's failure to meet the relationship's essential needs, prompting the child to seek solace elsewhere (Bobroff 35). This complex interplay is illustrated in the film Every Secret Thing, where Alice and her mother share a complicated emotional connection that influences the unfolding events, including a series of kidnappings. Alice finds herself entangled in these crimes due to her mother's favoritism towards another child, leaving her feeling deeply insecure. The tensions surrounding race relations further complicate matters, leading to suspicions falling on Alice, who had given up a biracial child for adoption while incarcerated. Alice's mother, the cunning orchestrator behind the kidnappings and a murder, manipulates evidence to frame her daughter, culminating in Alice's wrongful imprisonment. As the story unfolds, the audience witnesses the heartbreaking injustice faced by Alice and Ronnie, as well as the failure of the justice system to hold the true culprit accountable.",
    "This article discusses a recent incident at a hot dog restaurant in Chicago that raises ethical concerns. A man was asked to wear a mask while using the restaurant's services, but instead of complying, he threw snow in the employee's face multiple times and damaged the glass door. While these actions may not be illegal, they are disrespectful and disproportionate to the situation. From a utilitarian perspective, the man's behavior is considered wrong due to the negative consequences, such as harm to the employee and property damage. On the other hand, the Kantian moral theory views the man's actions as irrational for disregarding moral duty and causing harm. Ultimately, the utilitarian approach seems to be the most logical to address this ethical problem, as it emphasizes minimizing harm to others as a guiding principle for decision-making.",
    "The primary source utilized in this investigation is the esteemed medical publication, The Lancet. The journal disseminates the results of the survey, presenting an array of statistics and a comparative analysis of the quantitative data acquired. Conversely, The Economist can be regarded as a secondary source that outlines the research with less emphasis on digital content.\n\nThis study illustrates a reduction in the incidence of HIV infection among school-aged girls by ameliorating their families' financial constraints. Funding for the research was provided by the World Bank to highlight the role of financial resources in mitigating the spread of HIV among economically disadvantaged young girls. The study was authored by Berk Özler, a distinguished Lead Economist and Poverty Research Manager.\n\nThe statistical data presented in The Lancet emanates from a survey conducted in the Zomba district of Malawi. Subsequently, The Economist offered a synopsis of the critical findings deduced from the analysis. The study featured the participation of 1,300 unmarried girls aged 13 to 22, a substantial sample size deemed adequate for assessing HIV prevalence in impoverished regions.\n\nParticipants were selected for the study through computerized randomization, subsequently assigned to various experimental groups. Notably, one group received regular monetary stipends, incentivizing girls to attend school, while another group received no financial support. The findings indicate a notable reduction in HIV transmission among subjects who received monetary assistance compared to those who did not, with the latter resorting to exploitative relationships.\n\nThis underscores the significant impact of financial aid in curbing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. It is apparent that financial resources are crucial in combatting the dissemination of HIV, highlighting the imperative for global funding initiatives. Nevertheless, this research and the assistance provided to young girls encounter several challenges and limitations.\n\nForemost among these limitations is the challenge of determining the precise monetary requirements necessary for individuals to abstain from exploitative relationships. Furthermore, the study's duration of 18 months presents constraints in predicting the long-term efficacy of these interventions.",
    "Horror films have become a fundamental genre in cinema, garnering remarkable popularity comparable to other styles. This widespread appeal is driven by the intense emotional impact they deliver to the target audience. For many individuals, horror movies offer a psychological release that allows them to escape from personal troubles. It is important to note that horror films are not akin to public lynching; instead, they provide a channel for experiencing strong emotional reactions, particularly fear. Fear, a primal human emotion rooted in self-preservation, serves as a response to perceived threats. Despite the paradox of willingly subjecting oneself to unpleasant emotions, Stephen King in his essay \"Why We Crave Horror Movies\" argues that such experiences help individuals reaffirm their sense of normality. People engage with horror films for various reasons, including seeking distraction, seeking an adrenaline rush, and using them as a safe outlet for intense emotions. While art is typically associated with evoking positive emotions, horror films, despite their gruesome nature, excel in invoking powerful reactions from audiences. This ability to elicit strong emotional responses distinguishes horror films as an art form and contributes to their enduring popularity. In conclusion, horror films serve as a means for individuals to experience intense emotions and seek respite from reality and personal challenges, with audience reactions playing a crucial role in defining the success and artistic value of these films.",
    "A mutation represents a unique opportunity for evolution in the genome of an organism. It is often characterized as a disruption in the DNA structure, resulting in altered gene sequences or the emergence of novel genes. This discussion focuses on the intriguing concept of spontaneous mutations. Spontaneous mutations, occurring randomly, can lead to remarkable outcomes – such as the sudden birth of a sheep with shorter legs in a flock of sheep, or variations in humans. One captivating instance involves the ADRB1 gene, which governs the required amount of nightly sleep for optimal functioning. While most individuals need at least eight hours of sleep, approximately 5% of the population possess a distinctive mutant variant. Notably, a mother and daughter with this mutation displayed the astonishing ability to thrive on only 4 to 6 hours of sleep each night (Servick, 2019). The discussed genomic mutation affects a protein that serves as a receptor for norepinephrine. This dominant, autosomal mutation demonstrates its beneficial impact on individuals' vitality. Although alterations in the ADRB1 gene are primarily observed in humans, the possibility of such changes in animals also exists, albeit without conclusive research. Due to the benign and non-life-threatening nature of this mutation, it has not significantly impacted the broader human population. Rather, it represents a positive enhancement to the capabilities of carriers. While sporadic, this mutation does not reflect a prevalent trend in population-wide genome variations despite its dominance. I am particularly fascinated by this case as it highlights how natural genomic alterations present fresh prospects for the human populace. Therefore, a comprehensive exploration of such transformations is crucial for advancing human development and understanding the full extent of human potential.",
    "In his graphic novel, Spiegelman employs the literary device of anthropomorphism to delineate distinctions among various racial groups, such as Americans, Germans, and Jews. This creative technique serves to render the weighty subject matter more accessible to readers, consequently drawing heightened attention to the author's thematic discourse. Within \"Maus,\" Spiegelman renders a poignant portrayal of the Holocaust, underscoring the humanity and individuality of its victims and survivors.  \n\nThe initial segment for examination is Chapter 1 – \"The Sheik,\" wherein the protagonist Artie implores his father Vladek to recount his wartime experiences. Rather than recounting the harrowing aspects of his Holocaust ordeal, Vladek nostalgically reminisces about the carefree days of 1935 (Spiegelman, 1980, pp. 13-23). This inclination to recollect moments of joy underscores the victims' penchant for cherishing happier times amidst adversity. \n\nSubsequently, Chapter 3 - \"Prisoner of War,\" delves into Vladek's recollections of his early wartime encounters as a soldier. Notably, Vladek recalls the identity of a soldier he had slain, illustrating the human psyche's propensity to cling onto seemingly inconsequential details amidst calamity (Spiegelman, 1980, p. 50). Vladek's reunion with his family is then heralded as a triumphant event that outweighs his tribulations as a prisoner of war.\n\nThe analysis further extends to Chapter 5 – \"Mouse Holes,\" which illuminates the challenging decisions faced by many mice during war, as survival takes precedence (Spiegelman, 1980). Even in the face of profound personal loss, parents are compelled to maintain emotional composure to evade potential dangers. \n\nIn essence, this graphic novel encapsulates a distinctive literary exposition on World War II. Through his intricate illustrations, Spiegelman adeptly captures the atrocities of the Holocaust alongside the nuanced, yet significant, elements that sustained victims and nurtured hope within some. Despite the war's pervasive brutality and bloodshed, the author adeptly exposes the irony inherent in the situation – portraying the Germans as mere animals who arrogantly perceive themselves as superior to others.",
    "When creating a web-based system to store information about students and their transcripts for the university, there are certain risks that need to be addressed in the feasibility report. By using the standard risk evaluation process, we can categorize these risks into two main groups. The first group includes risks that could affect the project's progress and completion, while the second group involves risks that could impact the system's performance after completion.\n\nHere are the risks related to the project's progression and completion:\n- Unforeseen delays and additional time requirements may arise if the project turns out to be more complex than expected.\n- The project could slow down if team members fall ill, affecting production.\n- There is a risk of hardware and software malfunctions affecting the project timeline.\n\nOn the other hand, risks related to the system's performance after completion include:\n- The system may not provide sufficient security for handling personal student information.\n- It could be economically unviable to maintain and operate the system.\n- The system might not meet the university's performance requirements.\n\nTo address time-related issues, we can track project progress against the planned timeline and adjust as needed. Testing the system against its requirements and milestones can help identify functionality and performance risks. Allocating extra time initially can help manage potential delays due to personnel or hardware issues. However, dealing with risks affecting the system's performance may be more challenging and require reactive measures if not addressed during testing phases.",
    "Renewal of Perspective:\n\nThe analysis of three key ratios — Return on Assets (RoA), Return on Equity (RoE), and Profit Margin — illuminates crucial insights for a contemporary business. These metrics serve as vital indicators of a company's profit generation potential. Return on assets (RoA) reveals how efficiently a company leverages its assets, borrowed included, to yield financial returns. Similarly, return on equity gauges profitability without factoring in company debt. Last but not least, profit margin compares sales to profits, offering a glimpse into a company's operational earnings.\n\nAssessment of ABC Company's Ratios:\n\nABC Company's performance showcases a successful business model that consistently generates profits. Healthy returns on equity and assets indicate promising investor returns. With a commendable profit margin, the company demonstrates sound financial management. Despite posting a turnover below $1 million, the profit margin exceeding 50% is praiseworthy. These results reflect a robust business model that positions ABC Company favorably in the market, although long-term sustained growth may require further initiatives.\n\nEvaluating ABC Company Financially:\n\nWhile ABC Company’s financial performance appears positive, comparing it with industry leaders can provide valuable insights for enhancing strengths and addressing weaknesses. Though the company's current return on assets stands at 28.3%, a significantly higher figure than the industry average of 9.1-9.3%, its absolute cash flows fall short. This discrepancy could impact future ratios as the company expands. Notably, ABC Company's net income lags behind industry averages, suggesting considerable room for growth. As ABC Company's assets rise, sustaining current profit margins and returns will be pivotal for remaining competitive in the industry. By emphasizing above-average operational profitability, the company can work towards long-term success.",
    "By delving into the lives of mighty gods and exploring their intricate relationships and interactions, the \"Iliad\" and \"Metamorphosis\" vividly illuminate the pervasive issue of power abuse among those in positions of authority. Within the pages of the \"Iliad,\" the downfall of Agamemnon underscores the consequences of relentless power-hungry actions: \"be ready, that I be not left,/Alone of all the Greeks, without my prize\" (Homer, 762 B. C.). Similarly, in \"Metamorphosis,\" the callous disregard shown by deities towards the less powerful is chillingly depicted: \"What had escaped the waves, now feared the flame\" (Ovid, 8 B.C.). While both epics address the theme of power abuse, the \"Iliad\" confronts the repercussions faced by the divine for their neglect, a condemnation less frequently seen in \"Metamorphosis\" (Homer, 762 B. C.; Ovid, 8 B. C.).\n\nThe ongoing relevance of the protection of mortals, a central concern in both the \"Iliad\" and \"Metamorphosis,\" cannot be overstated. In the modern world, numerous leaders wield immense power through politics, economics, or a blend of both (Homer, 762 B. C.; Ovid, 8 B. C.). This echoes the god-like dominance seen in nations like China, reminiscent of the power dynamics portrayed in the ancient epics. Yet, where \"Metamorphosis\" adds a touch of dark humor to the abuse of mortals, the \"Iliad\" adopts a more somber tone, intensifying its condemnation of the cruelty of all-powerful beings towards humanity, aligning more closely with contemporary views on power abuse. Nevertheless, both the \"Iliad\" and \"Metamorphosis\" deliver vital messages, shedding light on power structures in Ancient Greek society and prompting reflection on similar patterns in the present-day world.",
    "Zulaika's (2022) article delves into the profound repercussions of the COVID-19 lockdowns on adolescent pregnancy rates and school dropout rates specifically among secondary school girls in Kenya. The onset of teenage pregnancies in Kenya coincided with the nationwide closure of schools which commenced in March 2020 and extended until January 2021. Zulaika's (2022) research meticulously explores the far-reaching consequences of the pandemic on the sexual and reproductive health of adolescents in the Rarieda subcounty. The study unearths a troubling lack of proactive intervention from healthcare administrators concerning the issue of teenage pregnancies among school-aged girls. It sheds light on the fact that teenagers often lack comprehensive sexual education, remain uninformed about various contraceptive methods, and consequently face heightened risks associated with early pregnancies that can pose severe health implications and give rise to multifaceted socio-economic challenges in the future.\n\nNotably, the escalating rates of adolescent pregnancies may lead to a diminished population of educated females in Kenya. The epidemiological study by Zulaika (2022) also underscores the elevated levels of stress experienced by pregnant teenagers, emphasizing the pivotal link between mental and physical health among these vulnerable young mothers. In her advocacy for proactive measures, Zulaika (2022) recommends instating population-wide interventions focused on educating school-going girls about sexual health, contraception, and the potential vicissitudes of engaging in sexual activities. The article accentuates the critical need for a comprehensive national initiative aimed at disseminating crucial information pertaining to sexual and reproductive health among students and their families.\n\nThe detrimental impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on teenage pregnancies reverberates across society, manifesting as a catalyst for heightened social and economic challenges not solely for the affected young mothers and their families but also for the broader national landscape.",
    "The country selected for the assignment is France. To repatriate human remains to France, one must engage with a specific Consulate General situated in California, Los Angeles. Prior arrangements involve scheduling a meeting with a designated specialist at the consulate's office at least two days in advance to meticulously discuss the necessary procedures for dispatching the remains and ensuring the proper sealing of the urn. The Consulate General of France in Los Angeles serves as a pivotal resource for individuals seeking assistance in this process.\n\nThe required documentation to be provided to the family includes a death certificate from the United States, a medical report, a certificate of cremation and sealing, an attestation confirming the absence of foreign attachments and proper sealing of the urn, a declaration of the deceased's freedom from infectious diseases, and an authorization to import the remains. Additionally, consent for repatriation and certified translations of the death and cremation certificates into French are essential components.\n\nFurthermore, a secure, airtight urn containing the ashes of the deceased is required. The transportation of the urn to France entails making direct arrangements with the French consulate in the U.S. and adhering to the aforementioned document requirements. Notable airlines such as Air France-KLM specialize in the transportation of human remains, with flight arrangements typically facilitated through agreements between U.S. funeral companies and the destination country.\n\nJulie Duhaut-Bedos, a representative of the consulate, has been the designated point of contact for communication. Assistance with flight bookings, including the selection of a direct or connecting flight depending on the distance, is provided by the consulate. Each airline has specific guidelines for the transportation of such cargo, including the requirement for securely sealed urns within lockable containers with robust walls, transported solely in the cargo hold of the plane.",
    "Amazon has transformed into a key player in the US business landscape. Countless individuals depend on its swift deliveries and competitive prices. The company has also become one of the biggest employers, with its numerous fulfillment centers spread nationwide. However, its vast operations have led to a myriad of challenges. Recent concerns about Amazon's treatment of its workforce have sparked public interest. Therefore, a thorough examination is essential to gauge the working conditions and environment at this tech behemoth. \n\nKey Issues: Dissatisfaction among employees and high turnover rates. While offering a $15 hourly wage may attract workers in the short term, it might not be a sustainable motivation strategy. A more effective approach could involve gradually increasing pay to incentivize better performance and reduce turnover in the long run. Worker motivation and task assignments are influenced by labor market competitiveness, providing the option for employees to switch to other companies. Therefore, Amazon should consider adopting a more conventional approach to motivating its workforce, which could help address its high turnover rates.\n\nRoot Cause: Inadequate motivation techniques. The e-commerce landscape has evolved significantly over the past decade, with increased competition from new companies vying for market share. To remain competitive, Amazon has been focused on cost-cutting measures, such as building fulfillment centers in economically struggling neighborhoods. According to Kinicki (2020), turnover is a critical outcome to consider when assessing inputs. Amazon's high turnover rate remains a significant challenge.\n\nProposed Solution: Implementing more traditional motivation frameworks. Current policies at Amazon, which emphasize fear and discourage team camaraderie, are negatively impacting employee morale and the company's public image. To address this, a potential solution includes introducing structured pay raises, enhancing bonus systems, and revising performance metrics. These measures aim to motivate employees in a more positive and respectful manner.",
    "American slavery originated as a means of labor exploitation within capitalism and evolved into an independent socio-economic and political system. A liberation movement emerged, challenging the unethical \"ownership\" of individuals and paving the way for emancipation. Despite official freedom, former slaves faced challenges with limited resources, documentation, and support, hindering their integration into society. Discrimination persisted even after slavery was abolished following the Civil War and the passing of the Thirteenth Amendment, marking a dark chapter in US history. Questions lingered about compensating slaves for the harm inflicted upon them. Liberation did not guarantee true emancipation; without essential resources, survival and integration posed significant obstacles. Unequal societal attitudes complicated the assimilation of ex-slaves, underscoring the lingering effects of their past dependence.",

    "Regarding the essence of competition, the dynamic competitive field encompasses various aspects such as the quantity and scale of enterprises, their strengths and vulnerabilities, obstacles to market entry and exit, as well as threats from alternative products. Today, it starkly contrasts with the conventional competitive setting that leaned heavily on substantial advertising budgets and economies of scale - and it is continuously evolving due to swift technological advances. Given the ever-changing circumstances, the modern competitive ethos is characterized by creativity, fusion, adaptability, and agility. It banks on data for informed business decisions to secure competitive edges and establish transparent business operations, embraces cutting-edge market technologies, and strives to enhance customer satisfaction. Broadly speaking, businesses seeking to maintain competitiveness primarily concentrate on customer-centric activities to meet consumer needs, bolster brand recognition, and foster brand loyalty. Various factors drive the current competitive environment, including novel business paradigms, consumer safeguarding, price clarity, heightened competition, and environmental consciousness, with flexibility and technology standing out as pivotal drivers. Put differently, companies cannot solely rely on a single strategy for sustainable growth and prosperity and must leverage all available technological tools to surpass competitors. Consequently, entities that display flexibility, adopt multifaceted strategies, and seize opportunities can thrive even in challenging economic climates. As an illustration, NVIDIA, a global technology conglomerate specializing in designing graphics processing and chip units for professional markets, gaming, and mobile devices, continues to excel despite the economic downturn triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic. Leveraging the global lockdown and consumers' increased isolation, the company has shifted its focus to remote computing services and video gaming, with around seven million Nintendo gaming consoles featuring NVIDIA chips sold in the third quarter of 2020 (Fitch, 2020). This instance underscores that in today's competitive landscape, businesses able to swiftly adjust to any circumstances are poised to remain productive and highly sought-after.",
    "Guaman Poma, a descendant of Incan noblemen, bore witness to the oppressive rule of the colonial government and experienced firsthand the injustices inflicted upon his family. Following the Spanish conquest of Peru, his noble lineage was stripped of its lands and titles, with his efforts to reclaim them consistently thwarted by the colonial authorities. Initially collaborating with the oppressors, Poma found himself banished on unfounded claims of false nobility. In response, he boldly exposed the mistreatment of the native people by the Spanish, culminating in a monumental 1200-page illustrated manuscript addressed to the Spanish king. This magnum opus meticulously chronicles the pre-invasion Andean way of life and vividly portrays the atrocities endured under the tyranny of the Conquistadors.\n\nPoma's groundbreaking work challenges the narrative promoted by the colonizers, rejecting their assertion of bringing civilization and order to the Incas as a guise for exploitation and dominance. His vision advocates for a government founded on principles of representation and adaptation to the practical needs of its populace. He espouses a model of governance where power is derived from the people it serves, a concept remarkably ahead of its time. By emphasizing the necessity of government tailored to the historical occupants of the land, Poma dismantles the fallacy that the Spanish were rightful stewards of Peruvian territory bestowed by God.\n\nIn highlighting the contradictions between Spanish professed morals and their oppressive actions, Poma exposes the inherent hypocrisy in their rule. He bravely articulates how the incursions of foreign settlers led to the obliteration of an entire way of life, inflicting irreparable harm on the indigenous population and depriving them of agency. Poma's work serves as a profound testament to the principles of liberty, political representation, social accountability, and autonomy for sovereign states. His enduring legacy resonates in his profound assertion that governance should be a product of the people it governs, a concept that continues to reverberate as a beacon for modern political discourse.",
    "Rewrite: The power of prayer is fueled by the intricacies of cognitive processes, hinged on two crucial attention skills: switching and concentration. During prayer, individuals pivot and focus on a realm of heightened spirituality. The consistent recitation of worship calls for repeated immersion in religious themes, fortifying the mental bond with the divine. According to the findings by Froese and Jones (2021), prayer bolsters belief in the supernatural, framing it as an act of faith. Moreover, public prayers have historically been wielded as a potent tool in shaping the political landscape (Froese & Jones, 2021). Thus, prayer can be perceived as both a sacred weapon and a supernatural force. This notion, echoed in Martin's writings, draws on historical accounts where prayer was employed strategically, such as the miraculous event in A.D. 174 when a Roman legion, through prayer, unearthed a life-saving spring that swept away their adversaries (Martin, 2019). Both authors stress that prayers are akin to weapons, drawing individuals closer to God. Partaking in such rituals often results in feelings of social acceptance and emotional rejuvenation post-prayer. The rhythmic repetition of prayers serves to reinforce the values and precepts of a specific faith (Froese & Jones, 2021). Martin further argues that these circumstances explain why prayer is utilized as a tool for spiritual insight. Proactive prayer emerges in response to a vision of destiny, offering a means to shape the future through faith (Froese & Jones, 2021). Throughout early Christian history, fervent pleas were directed to God for protection in battle, assuaging the fears of the Israelites and boosting their resolve long before the advent of Jesus (Martin, 2019). Such prayers served to embolden soldiers before combat, promising heavenly reward for victory (Martin, 2019). The concept of seeking divine intervention through prayers has persisted across Christian history, underscoring the proactive nature of prayers as a unifying theme between these authors. In summary, repentance, as elucidated by Paul in his second letter to the Corinthians, is a transformative act deeply rooted in sorrow for one's actions, leading to salvation (2 Corinthians 7:10). True repentance entails a steadfast commitment to turning away from sin, purifying the soul and opening it to the full grace of the Holy Spirit. May this dedication guide your spiritual journey.",
    "Supporters of relativism believe that objective morality does not exist. They argue that moral norms in society are not mandatory and that the concepts of good and evil are merely constructs. Researcher Porus warns that moral relativism can lead to permissiveness. Those who hold this view might be seen as devaluing moral standards, refusing to compromise, and negotiate. In contrast, objectivism asserts that there are universal rights and wrongs, independent of personal opinions. It suggests that moral standards are inherent and unchanging, not man-made. Objectivism rejects relativism in all aspects, emphasizing one absolute truth. While objectivism acknowledges that some moral norms can evolve, it maintains a consistent understanding of morality. Despite its flaws, I personally find relativism more persuasive. Absolute objectivity may lack a moral foundation, making it unreliable. Relativism, on the other hand, is more realistic. Every day, we encounter situations where determining right from wrong isn't straightforward. Despite good intentions, our actions may be judged negatively by others due to personal experiences, circumstances, and various factors. Objectivism, in my opinion, presents an overly idealistic and simplistic view of morality that risks distorting reality.",

    "Archetypes are universal patterns that define events, objects, and people. In literature, they represent common themes that help people understand stories. These archetypes also exist in everyday life and greatly influence how we perceive the world. Certain archetypes of people shape their character, actions, and motivations. By applying this concept to daily life, we can identify unique individuals with shared characteristics that are influenced by their actions and surroundings. For instance, the head of a major corporation like Elon Musk embodies the archetype of a visionary leader who inspires change. Recognizing these archetypes helps us better understand people and events. While real individuals may have mixed traits, grasping archetypes provides insight into their motivations and behaviors, aiding in forming relationships with them.",

    "Deductive reasoning is like connecting the dots to predict outcomes. It's all about linking facts to understand how things will play out in the future (Besnard & Hunter, 2018). In simple terms, a logical argument consists of two parts: the starting point and the final result. For an argument to be solid, it needs to be structured in a way that ensures if the initial facts are accurate, then the conclusion will be true. \n\nLet's break it down with an example: 1. If someone says all metals are heavy, 2. Tin is mentioned as a metal, then 3. You can assume that tin is heavy based on these statements. \n\nAn argument is solid when it has a strong structure and uses true information. If an argument is well-structured but relies on false information, like saying all dogs are cats and all mice are dogs, then it might sound valid but, in reality, it's not. \n\nIn essence, a sound argument must have a logical structure and true facts. If it's not structured correctly, then no matter what you believe, the final conclusion won't hold. So, it's important to ensure that when making a point, you base it on both good reasoning and solid facts (Besnard & Hunter, 2018).",
    "Aristotle revolutionized logic by introducing variables, revealing that it is not limited to specific terms but encompasses the fundamental laws of syllogisms like modus ponens and modus tollens. Formal logic abstracts from specific judgments to unveil a universal structure shared among diverse objects. Syllogism, Aristotle's groundbreaking discovery, forms the core of his logical theory, where he defined and classified syllogisms, outlined working and non-working types, and established three syllogistic figures. Aristotle was the first to systematically study reasoning methods, viewing them as complete formations rather than isolated components. His contributions laid the groundwork for understanding truth in logical thinking, introducing fundamental concepts like Modus Ponens and Modus Tollens. While modern logic evolved from philosophy and mathematics, it is characterized by its technical and straightforward nature, often referred to as mathematical logic for its innovative methods and reliance on exact sciences and computer technology. Although modern logic may lack some traditional philosophical nuances, its emphasis on precise language and intelligence is essential for its integration with precision-driven disciplines.",

    "Rewriting: The criminal justice system operates on the principle of fairness and equality for all individuals in society. It assumes innocence and places the burden of proof on the prosecution to prove guilt beyond any doubt. This system provides advantages to the defendant when there is any uncertainty, such as the right to remain silent and the right to have legal representation. While these safeguards are meant to protect the accused, they can also present ethical challenges by potentially favoring the defendant over the prosecution.\n\nThe competition between prosecution and defense in court cases can sometimes lead to tactics that prioritize winning over presenting the truth. To address this issue, it may be beneficial to allow both sides to present evidence before a judgment is made to avoid any injustices.\n\nRacial disparities within the criminal justice system have been evident, with statistics showing that black individuals are more likely to be arrested and convicted compared to white individuals for similar offenses. Reports have shown that black men facing the same charges as white men receive longer prison sentences, highlighting racism and bias within the system that need to be addressed.",
    "Understanding the origins and backgrounds of religions and philosophies is crucial for interpreting their context and content. Jainism, with a history of nearly 2500 years, predates the more contemporary Sikhism by a significant margin. While both share connections with Hinduism, Sikhism emerged around 500 years ago, presenting a more modern and militaristic approach to monotheism. The Jainist belief in the absence of a Creator and the reliance on natural forces to govern the universe is intriguing as it deviates from the traditional incorporation of deities into theology.\n\nExamining how religions engage with the world through their perspectives can offer valuable insights. Jainism's rejection of a Creator or God raises philosophical questions akin to those explored in atheist circles. These inquiries challenge the coherence of common monotheistic beliefs, such as the paradox of a perfect God creating an imperfect world or allowing suffering despite loving all life. Jainism also addresses a logical conundrum regarding the necessity of a Creator, prompting contemplation on its modern and potentially contentious worldview.\n\nEthics form a fundamental aspect of any philosophy or belief system, with Jainism emphasizing five ethical principles: Ahimsa (non-violence), Satya (truth), Astheya (non-stealing), Brahmacharya (chastity), and Aparigraha (non-possession). The concept of Ahimsa, central to Jainist ethics, intrigues me greatly as it highlights a commitment to non-violence that I believe should take precedence over justifications for aggression perpetuated by many religions. Jainism's unwavering stance on the imperative nature of non-violence resonates with my moral values, underlining the notion that such behavior is indefensible.",
    "It is common for individuals from one culture to struggle to understand the complexities of another culture. This phenomenon is known as ethnocentrism, where one's perspective is centered around their own culture. For instance, the book illustrates how people in America may not grasp the excitement of a fast food chain opening in a developing country. As someone from Canada, I am immersed in Canadian culture, which may be misunderstood by individuals from developing nations. The book also discusses how Westerners may not comprehend certain actions in other regions due to historical context, highlighting a difference in perceptions. In Canada, while some may view Canadians as excessively polite, it is not always the case. The book further explores how leaders viewed differently across different cultures, with the example of Hitler's perception varying between regions. Similarly, Canadian leaders may not always be perceived accurately, as they also face power struggles and challenges in governing the nation. This reality is increasingly apparent in recent events.",
    "Globalization involves the flow of information, investments, trade, political cooperation, cultural values, and social ideas among different countries. It enables managers to operate internationally, hire employees globally, source materials from optimal locations, and sell products in diverse markets. While offering opportunities, globalization also brings risks like information security and cultural differences. A global mindset is essential for managers to understand and influence individuals with diverse backgrounds. International companies interact with a variety of perspectives, making it crucial for managers to adapt and not rely solely on their home country's worldview. Countries like China, India, and Brazil have grown economically and play vital roles in the global business landscape. Multinational corporations (MNCs) generate over 25% of their revenues from foreign operations and operate with close coordination among affiliates globally. MNC managers typically adopt a global perspective, considering the world as one market. Outsourcing involves delegating tasks to locations with cost-effective resources, while exporting involves selling goods produced domestically in foreign markets. Licensing allows foreign firms access to specific resources for production and sale, and direct investing involves managing production facilities in another country.",
    "This study examined the impact of a positive message on dining checks regarding upcoming specials on the tipping behavior of restaurant patrons. The independent variable was the presence of the helpful message, while the dependent variable was the percentage of the bill left as a tip to the waiter. The research aimed to elucidate the dynamics of restaurant tipping culture by focusing on tip percentages.\n\nSeveral potential confounding variables in this experiment included food quality, server gender, dining party size, and customer loyalty. Despite strengths such as design transparency, implementation simplicity, and potential for replication, variations in message content based on specials could have influenced customer responses. Moreover, the study's limited scope to one restaurant may hinder generalization to diverse dining establishments.\n\nTo clarify the impact of message content on tipping behavior, researchers could have explored alternative message types beyond just informative ones. Additionally, varying server assignments could have provided a more comprehensive analysis of tipping behavior among diners.\n\nGiven the importance of maintaining consistent server behavior to control for confounding variables, the study's internal validity was carefully managed. However, challenges related to external validity arose due to potential limitations in generalizing findings based on variables like server demographics and dining settings.\n\nAn expansion of research groups to include solo diners could have offered valuable insights into the influence of group dynamics on tipping outcomes. By further investigating the effect of server gender and dining party size on tipping behavior, the study could have provided a more nuanced understanding of restaurant tipping practices.",

    "Hey there! Did you know that different cultures all over the globe have their own super cool creation myths with unique ways of depicting them through art? It's really interesting to see how the Aztec civilization's cosmology differed so much from the Europeans who later conquered them. In European beliefs, the Christian God created humanity in his image and gave them dominion over the beautiful Garden of Eden. He's often seen as a kind, yet strict, father figure who forgives sins and offers redemption. In art, you’ll find Him portrayed as a wise, old man with a beard and white hair, highlighting forgiveness and the beautiful world He made.\n\nNow, let’s check out the Aztec creation stories! Their myths are all about dismembered gods and the world's origin being born out of catastrophic violence, which is why their art showcases divinity in such a gruesome and awe-inspiring way. Aztec art serves as a reminder to obey the gods and fulfill their demands for blood sacrifices in exchange for food. Talk about intense, right? They worship a female goddess as their central figure, but like Eve in Christian beliefs, she’s often shown as a passive character who gets punished by other gods. The story of Coatlique giving birth against her children's wishes could even be seen as an Aztec version of Eve's sin of disobedience.\n\nBoth Aztec and Christian gods are described as perfect and self-sufficient, but the key difference lies in how they view good and evil. While Aztecs believe their gods are above such concepts, Christians see evil as belonging to Satan, the opposite of God. This leads Aztecs to cater to a bloodthirsty goddess for survival, while Christians strive to reject sin and surrender to God for eternal salvation.\n\nIn a nutshell, the Christian creation story focuses on forgiveness and love, while the Aztec one revolves around survival through violence. The distinct art styles of these two cultures beautifully capture the contrasting themes of their beliefs. Pretty fascinating, don’t you think?",
    "The idea of nursing is closely linked with continuous improvement, where healthcare trends should align with societal changes to offer the best possible care. One way to ensure top-notch care is to utilize the latest research findings to adjust care strategies in the workplace, a process known as evidence-based practice (EBP). Currently, nurses are not actively engaging in EBP for various reasons. First, heavy workloads often deter nurses from embracing EBP. Physical opportunity, as noted by McArthur et al. (2021), is a crucial factor influencing nurses' ability to adopt EBP, encompassing barriers like cost constraints, limited resources, poor communication, staff turnover, and lack of clear guidelines. Consequently, management tends to react to the environment rather than proactively addressing it. Another significant obstacle to EBP in the workplace is the absence of social opportunity, stemming from inadequate organizational support and teamwork (McArthur et al., 2021).\n\nGiven the prevalent challenges outlined above, interventions are necessary to promote and facilitate EBP usage. One effective method is to establish leadership that not only models EBP but also provides training and workshops to encourage its implementation. Additionally, ensuring nurses have access to pertinent resources in the workplace, such as relevant databases, reliable Internet connectivity, and subscriptions to peer-reviewed journals, can greatly streamline the use of scholarly research and reduce stress for nurses.",
    "Beowulf stands out as one of the most prominent ancient European poems, though its true origins are a subject of ongoing debate. Commonly described as “a Danish poem in the Anglo-Saxon dialect,” this epic tale recounts the heroic exploits of Beowulf, a figure believed to be divinely chosen to protect and serve the people. He assists King Hrothgar of the Danes by defeating the monster Grendel and his mother, highlighting his selfless bravery. Eventually ascending to the throne himself, Beowulf faces a dragon threatening his realm, a battle in which he triumphs but meets his tragic end. The narrative delves into profound themes such as the significance of identity, emphasizing the importance of ancestral heritage and the pursuit of fame. Additionally, it explores the evolution of personal responsibility and maturity, as Beowulf transitions from seeking individual glory to embracing his duty as a wise and caring ruler. The poem also delves into the complexities of human nature by exploring the conflicts between personal values, the heroic code, and the clash between Christian and pagan beliefs. Ultimately, Beowulf serves as a rich tapestry illustrating the intricacies of human existence and the challenges posed by conflicting value systems.",
    "Beowulf is an old English epic poem that tells the story of a hero named Beowulf in Jutland before the Angles moved to Britain. Beowulf is a famous character in Old English literature and has had a significant impact on popular culture. He is admired for his acceptance of fate, which stands out in a world filled with doubts and contradictions. This clarity and completeness in his character continue to attract attention today. \n\nModern superhero comics, such as the popular Marvel character Superman, share similarities with Beowulf. Both possess extraordinary strength and serve as role models for their respective times, overcoming obstacles to help those in need. Physical strength alone is not enough for modern heroes to be admired - they must also have pure intentions and good morals. \n\nThe presence of a formidable enemy whose defeat would ensure the world's survival is a common theme in both Beowulf and modern superhero stories. However, the complexity of modern heroes goes beyond physical prowess, reflecting the sophistication of today's world. People continue to find inspiration in ancient stories, aligning with postmodernist ideals of reinterpreting and experimenting with historical narratives. The enduring appeal of legendary superheroes illustrates society's ongoing admiration for traits like bravery and loyalty, which serve as the foundation for role models.",
    "Transforming a company with the P-O-L-C framework is a multi-faceted endeavor critical for success. Prioritizing key factors becomes imperative in navigating challenges or crises. Look no further than the cautionary tale of WorldCom's infamous collapse in 2002, stemming from a catastrophic breakdown in communication. Amidst rapid growth under Bernard Ebbers' leadership, seizing telecom opportunities led to eventual bankruptcy. Ebbers' fall from grace was marked by grave charges and a shocking chain of events within the company. The stark truth emerged - miscommunication plagued the telecom giant, as Ebbers and his associates professed ignorance of the fraudulent machinations unfolding. A damning statistic reveals that 80% of employees feel unheard, a revealing insight into WorldCom's downfall. Misunderstandings thrived, fueled by communication barriers and a toxic mix of distorted motives and egocentrism. Prioritizing self-interests, key players cherry-picked facts, setting the stage for disaster. As the corporate facade crumbled, the lack of cohesive teamwork emerged as the fatal flaw, echoing a sobering lesson on the grave importance of effective communication in any organization.",

    "The TED Talks illuminate profound bio-psycho-social-spiritual developmental challenges that lead to the exclusion of certain individuals from society. One example is Smith's (2015) discussion on the disparities faced in raising white versus black children. Conversely, Abdel-Magied (2014) highlights how attire can drastically influence the treatment, perceptions, and judgments of Muslim women. Discrimination typically stems from biased attitudes, a multi-faceted issue as pointed out by The New York Times in 2016 regarding the experiences of non-white individuals in the US and their struggle for inclusion. Such bias fosters unfair preferences towards certain groups over others, with its manifestations being automatic, complex, and often conflicting (Fiske, 2022). Though I may not have personally encountered these injustices, I have witnessed their detrimental effects on the self-esteem and confidence of those around me. It is imperative to delve into the examination of racial bias, especially in the context of today's society, and uncover its structural implications for a more inclusive future.",
    "The film \"Coded Bias\" delves deep into the inherent flaws within facial recognition algorithms, pinpointing sources of bias rooted in creators' focus on white faces. This skewed original orientation has resulted in the underrepresentation of dark complexion data and the prevalence of biased male developers. These disparities hinder the attainment of racial and gender equality, posing a significant threat to the field by failing to cater to diverse needs. The opacity surrounding data processing and decision-making in these programs further exacerbates risks. To mitigate bias in facial recognition algorithms, it is imperative to bar their usage in legal and law enforcement contexts and implement practical enhancements. Accepting accountability for decisions and revamping databases to enhance diversity, while subjecting systems to independent scrutiny, can pave the way for reducing race and gender-based biases and ensuring operational efficacy. These measures are pivotal for fostering responsible technology use and tackling surveillance issues affecting marginalized communities. Upholding accountability in decision-making, alongside harmonizing internal and external assessments, holds the key to rectifying existing issues outlined by Nakamura and Browne and securing the field's future suitability for investigations.",
    "The history of the Caribbean region is characterized by the harsh colonization efforts of Western powers such as Spain. Following colonization, the region became inhabited by indigenous groups like the Ciboney or Guanahuatebey, Taino Arawak, and Carib, who were later subjected to enslavement by European colonizers. Despite being a minority among the local population, these colonizers imposed brutal rule over the majority Black community.\n\nDespite this oppressive environment, the Black population in the Caribbean managed to preserve their cultural identity and traditions through various means, many of which are still vibrant today. The Caribbean has become synonymous with diverse musical genres that speak to themes of human freedom and revolution. Reggae, in particular, has become inseparable from the Caribbean experience and serves as the unofficial soundtrack to many island getaways.\n\nRenowned Reggae artists like Bob Marley and the Wailers used their music as a platform to protest against the injustices of White colonial rule in the Caribbean. Through powerful lyrics and melodies, they vocalized the anger and resistance of the African-descended people in the region. Additionally, the Afro-Caribbean community has maintained a strong connection to their African roots through their cuisines and customs, including religious practices.\n\nDishes like Callaloo, a popular Caribbean vegetable soup, serve as a reminder of the rich culinary heritage brought over by enslaved Africans. Festivals and parades in the Caribbean region also play a significant role in celebrating the area's folklore and African cultural traditions. Events like carnivals serve as important reminders of the historical legacy of slavery while also showcasing the resilience and cultural pride of the Caribbean people.\n\nDespite the challenging history of colonization and exploitation by the White minority, the Black community in the Caribbean has found ways to express their identity and resilience through music, food, and cultural practices that continue to unify and define the region today.",
    "Society has always played a big role in shaping states. When people come together in groups, they talk about their values, opinions, and reactions to what's going on around them. Hanging out in communities or clubs helps develop a shared outlook on events, shapes a way of living, and even affects politics - so changes in community life really matter. This idea is highlighted by Putnam in his essay “Bowling Alone.” He points out that social connections in the USA are weakening, and the outcome of this trend is hard to predict. The country used to be known for its active participation in social activities, but things are shifting now. Putnam mentions that “tens of millions of Americans no longer feel the same sense of duty towards basic civic engagement that their parents did” (67). This means that people are changing their habits, moving towards being more isolated and disconnected, which is not the norm in the U.S. Additionally, traditional groups like clubs are being replaced by large organizations where membership seems to lack real involvement in community matters. Putnam worries that this trend is causing people to drift apart and lose interest in community matters. In the long run, this could lead to a breakdown in community involvement, which is a cause for concern considering the USA's strong tradition of community relationships. Putnam warns that if things continue as they are, we'll end up bowling alone, disconnected from each other.",
    "Enhance the appeal of the text:\n\nGenetic predisposition plays a crucial role in the development of breast cancer, making it a disease deeply rooted in family history. When a patient's closest relatives have battled breast cancer, the possibility of tumors emerging even at a young age looms large (Coleman & Tsongalis, 2016). Thus, the diagnosis of breast cancer is a very real concern for individuals with a family history of the disease.\n\nAnother key factor contributing to cancer risks is the varied conditions of the mammary glands, such as 'cystic' breasts. Such conditions can pave the way for the formation of atypical cells within the glands, possibly leading to overgrowth and escalating the risk of severe illnesses (Tkaczuk et al., 2016).\n\nAdditionally, the patient's hormonal profile emerges as a critical influencer of health. Noteworthy details such as delayed first pregnancy, lack of breastfeeding, and long-term use of hormonal contraceptives further complicate matters, potentially disrupting the patient's hormonal equilibrium (Tkaczuk et al., 2016). This disturbance can hamper the body's ability to combat abnormal processes as one ages.\n\nThe existence of metastases in breast cancer can have a significant impact, especially in aggressive forms of the disease. Detecting and understanding these metastases through various diagnostic methods becomes essential to prevent future health complications. Early histological analysis of tissue can shed light on the cancer's aggressiveness, while techniques like CT scans and scintigraphy can reveal secondary foci in vital organs like the lungs, liver, bones, and brain. Notably, breast cancer metastases can lie dormant for years following the removal of the primary tumor, underscoring the importance of vigilance and timely intervention.",
    "International labor laws prohibit making decisions about individuals' employment based on their age and disabilities. Etihad Airways violated these regulations by implementing a layoff approach. This action can be seen as unethical and irrelevant, considering the importance of social justice for multinational corporations. Greater employee involvement in decision-making could have helped prevent this situation, leading to fair decisions that consider workers' input and improve performance. By compensating employees for their contributions, Etihad successfully rewarded their work. Payment processing is crucial for maintaining job security and motivating employees, allowing Etihad to reap benefits and potentially rehire them in the future. The reduction in job security caused a lack of confidence and motivation among specialists at Etihad, emphasizing the need to secure employee positions for effective fulfillment of duties. Discrimination was also evident in Etihad's change process, leading to dissatisfaction, low motivation, and disengagement. By ignoring corporate social responsibility issues, the company missed opportunities to employ non-discriminatory practices that could enhance job security and increase employees' willingness to work. Lack of employee involvement was a significant problem for the company, as top management made changes with minimal input, resulting in an unpopular strategy and dissatisfied workers. Etihad's failure to address employees' need for self-actualization decreased motivation and hindered their ability to influence the company's development. Modern workers should be given the opportunity to participate in corporate decision-making to realize their value and stay motivated. Etihad mistakenly viewed layoff as the only solution to manage the wage bill, but using disability and age as selection criteria violated labor laws and decreased job security for employees. Subsequently, employees faced burnout due to stress, lack of motivation, and engagement, negatively impacting their performance and Etihad's ability to achieve objectives. This case highlights the importance of involving employees in decision-making during change processes to boost motivation and identify optimal solutions.",

    "Here is a more approachable version of the text:\n\nMythology has been a fascinating topic for scholars and thinkers for thousands of years. In his book \"The Hero with a Thousand Faces,\" Joseph Campbell explores how myths shape our culture and influence human behavior. The first chapter of the book, called \"Myth and Dream,\" discusses how myths and dreams are intertwined in our minds to help us understand ourselves and navigate life's challenges.\n\nCampbell suggests that myths are both scary and intriguing because they challenge our sense of security but also offer insights into our inner selves. By analyzing myth-like dreams, he shows how they reveal our subconscious thoughts and emotions, often contradicting our conscious beliefs.\n\nFor example, Campbell describes a young man dreaming of harming his father to gain his mother's attention, a common theme in mythology. He also mentions a woman dreaming of a half-horse, half-man figure, reflecting hidden feelings that she may not be aware of consciously.\n\nThrough these examples, Campbell illustrates how myths can help us uncover our deepest fears and desires, shedding light on the complexities of our inner worlds. This connection between myths and dreams allows us to better understand ourselves and how our past experiences shape our present actions and emotions.",
    "Fad diets come and go, with some claiming that cutting out carbohydrates is the key to a healthier body. However, numerous reasons refute this notion. To achieve a beautiful and efficiently functioning body, a balance of nutrients is essential – including fats, proteins, carbohydrates, and water. Carbohydrates play a crucial role in converting into energy vital for the nervous system and brain, as well as supporting the proper metabolism of proteins and fats.\n\nWhen carbohydrates are eliminated, the risk of continuous fatigue and mood disturbances increases significantly. Furthermore, giving up carbs can lead to weight gain due to the body's susceptibility to storing carbohydrates after being deprived. This often results in regained weight shortly after returning to a regular diet, accompanied by increased cravings for carb-rich foods.\n\nNot consuming carbohydrates can also lead to physical symptoms such as malaise and headaches, potentially progressing to chronic migraines. Carbs are the brain's primary energy source, and restricting them can impair cognitive functions, concentration, and overall brain activity. It is crucial to include carbohydrates in your diet to ensure that all bodily systems function optimally.",

Companies can also explore mixed funding by combining different financing methods to acquire the necessary capital. All these funding avenues are viable for purchasing and implementing the Advanced Documentation System.",
    "The Rolling Stones were overshadowed by The Beatles right from the start, causing them great distress. While The Beatles basked in the limelight, The Rolling Stones struggled with feelings of inferiority. In response, they purposefully tried to position themselves as the anti-Beatles. The Beatles, renowned as pioneers of hard rock, had a profound impact on music, with their song Helter Skelter even laying the groundwork for heavy metal (Covach and Bell 28). The influence of The Rolling Stones on the evolution of rock music is immeasurable, not only musically but also artistically, visually, and in terms of their public image and media presence.\n\nIn their songwriting journey, The Rolling Stones strove to keep pace with their competitors but often found themselves trailing behind. Much of their work seemed like reactions to The Beatles' innovations. For instance, when the sitar made its debut in The Beatles' music, it promptly found its way into The Rolling Stones' repertoire. The Beatles, with their working-class background from Liverpool, maintained a polished and refined image, dressing sharply, keeping neat haircuts, and engaging in polite interactions. In stark contrast, The Rolling Stones embraced a rebellious aesthetic by donning black leather attire and exuding a provocative demeanor.\n\nThe arrival of The Beatles in the US in 1964 marked what was known as the British invasion (Covach and Bell 28). The Beatles achieved an unprecedented feat by occupying all top five spots on the Billboard singles chart simultaneously, solidifying their dominance. The Rolling Stones also made waves in the US, primarily through sensational exposure, but they were unable to overthrow The Beatles from the pinnacle of success.\n\nWhile The Beatles and The Rolling Stones were perceived as fierce rivals, their distinctive musical styles and public images set them apart. Despite these differences, both groups left an indelible mark on global music culture, emerging as two of the most iconic bands in history.",
    "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic and long-term condition characterized by uncontrollable, repetitive thoughts and behaviors that individuals feel compelled to repeat. Let's delve into the case of Robert, a twenty-three-year-old young man. Robert sought help at a mental health facility for anxiety, only to discover that he was actually struggling with OCD. He had a strong scent of disinfectant and exhibited excessive cleaning behaviors. After touching surfaces or people, Robert felt compelled to wash his hands with bleach. This urge led him to wash his hands up to thirty times a day, causing severe damage to his skin. Despite the toll these behaviors took on his mental health, Robert's fear of germs remained overwhelming, making it impossible for him to touch anything without washing his hands immediately. During the pandemic, his OCD symptoms worsened significantly. Robert began wearing a HAZMAT suit outdoors out of fear of catching the virus. In his social interactions, he refrained from physical contact and preferred maintaining distance from others. Working from home brought Robert considerable comfort, as it enabled him to avoid going out and spending time with people in enclosed spaces. Robert largely manages his OCD independently and prefers solitude most of the time. In his case, a combination of behavioral therapy and medication is likely to be beneficial. Cognitive-behavioral therapy, incorporating exposure and response prevention, as well as cognitive restructuring (Moody, 2017), could be effective in treating Robert's OCD. With consistent therapy, Robert is expected to experience relief from his symptoms within a few weeks.",
    "A physical examination is necessary to assess skin affected by cellulitis. Symptoms commonly include redness, swelling, and intense pain in the affected area. Brant is experiencing these symptoms in his right leg, which should be carefully examined for any signs of skin damage. Monitoring for changes in temperature and signs of an abscess is also important. Brant mentioned being bitten by a mosquito in the affected area, indicating a potentially serious case that may require complete blood count (CBC) testing for accurate diagnosis. Additional tests, such as a C-reactive protein (CRP) test for inflammation, may be ordered due to the broken skin from the mosquito bite. Brant's case shows systemic disturbance with chills and disorientation, highlighting the need to evaluate signs of erythematous inflammation and broken skin to diagnose cellulitis. Adjusting Brant's positioning to alleviate swelling, such as propping up his feet and arms with cushions, can help improve blood flow and prevent low blood pressure. Placing him on his side when nauseated or vomiting can also be beneficial. The skin's defense response to germs penetrating through it causes cellulitis, leading to redness, warmth, swelling, and pain. Brant's situation reflects this response after being bitten by a mosquito that introduced bacteria into his skin.",
    "One key aspect of the nursing profession is the need for professionals to continuously adjust to the ever-changing healthcare environment and patient care methods. To aid in this process, various change theories have been identified by researchers aiming to streamline the adoption of new practices. The two most prevalent change theories in nursing are Lewin’s change theory and Roger’s five-step theory. Lewin's model involves three main stages: unfreezing, implementing change, and refreezing. This means recognizing the current workflow, making changes, and establishing the new standard. On the other hand, Roger's model focuses on gradual staff acceptance and responses to change through a five-step process involving research, feedback gathering, piloting, and implementation. While Lewin's model centers on implementing evidence-based modifications, Roger's model aims to demonstrate the benefits of proposed changes in the clinical setting. When considering a change proposal for a capstone project, Roger's approach may be more suitable, especially in verifying the impact of EBP training on nurses' self-esteem and patient satisfaction. The effectiveness of Roger's model is highlighted by the successful integration of changes into staff scheduling patterns by a preceptor.",
    "Understanding the core distinction between a leader and an ordinary employee is crucial across all fields. While the typical company head focuses on internal financial matters, a good leader prioritizes the indispensable role of employees in any business venture. A great leader perceives the potential within each individual, fostering their growth to the fullest capacity by collaboratively guiding them rather than exerting pressure. The misguided practices of deficient leaders can result in detrimental outcomes for all facets of an organization. Regrettably, flawed leaders abound in contemporary society, spanning various disciplines. Instances of negative experiences can unfold on diverse scales, from personal incidents to global repercussions. Pinpointing a specific individual without firsthand encounters and concrete proof can be challenging, yet statistics underscore a significant prevalence of unscrupulous individuals in prominent roles. Noteworthy is the case of Jack Ma, the proprietor of the online retail platform Ali Express, who exemplifies this issue. Abundant evidence indicates that numerous products available for purchase are crafted by underaged laborers residing in impoverished regions. Jack Ma's silent endorsement perpetuates the exploitation of these individuals, subjecting them to paltry wages and deplorable living conditions. This instance typifies not only poor leadership but also active complicity in human rights violations. Central to such problems is a lack of empathy and regard for human dignity. A deficient leader often views people solely as commodities and a source of inexpensive labor. Understanding individuals' aspirations through the lens of ignorance and egotism proves problematic for such leaders, leading to a fruitless path. It is paramount to emphasize that such allegations necessitate rigorous data collection and analysis. Exploiting individuals, whether in business or politics, fails to yield positive outcomes and jeopardizes success. Respected professionals and individuals refuse to endure such mistreatment, swiftly seeking improved circumstances elsewhere. The primary misstep of many leaders lies in their self-centered worldview and inclination towards morally questionable exploitation of human resources.",

    "Distinguishing between primary and secondary sources: Primary sources offer first-hand evidence on the events being studied, such as diaries, photographs, and interview transcripts, enabling researchers to learn directly from witnesses. In contrast, secondary sources provide second-hand information and analyses from other researchers, like books and scholarly articles. \n\nThe importance of consulting various sources in historical research: It is essential to use a variety of sources in research as primary and secondary sources complement each other, providing credible evidence and additional information respectively. Consulting multiple sources allows researchers to gather more evidence, increase credibility, and stimulate critical thinking by offering different perspectives and prompting new inquiries. It is crucial to consider diverse sources to enhance the depth and breadth of research findings.",
    "The development of the Chesapeake colonies illustrates how slavery became integral to societies on these lands due to the need for a growing workforce to cultivate crops for economic survival. Indentured servants were initially used, but their limited contracts necessitated a continuous source of laborers. The transition to slavery was crucial for ensuring the colonies' survival by allowing for the unrestricted exploitation of individuals for various tasks. Similarly, the Middle colonies experienced a similar pattern, as the need for labor to support colony growth led to the acceptance of slavery despite the dominant Quaker values. This acceptance of slavery as a means to sustain and enrich the agricultural sector was a common trend in both the Middle and Chesapeake colonies during this period.",

    "Hey there! So, Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation (NDT) is a cool European journal all about dialysis, transplantation, and nephrology research. It's legit approved by the European Renal Association (ERA), offering up some top-notch analysis and data for scientists worldwide. \n\nAnd guess what? Another article from StatPearls made the cut as it's housed in the National Center for Biotechnological Information (NCBI). This center serves up and stores all the deets on scientifically approved research.\n\nIn the article, they dive into the main causes of chronic inflammation during end-stage renal failure. The authors also chat about how the disease impacts clinical outcomes and how middle molecules play a big role in the whole pathology situation. They even touch on the latest dialysis breakthroughs to keep things running smoothly.\n\nWhen it comes to end-stage kidney damage, things get serious as the disease threatens health and life. Things start with a decrease in urine output, and as it progresses through different stages, more signs crop up. By the time it hits stage 3, the kidneys are down for the count, leading to acute renal failure and a dip in overall well-being.\n\nTreatment options usually involve medications, especially since chronic renal failure affects quite a number of folks globally. It's an ongoing battle, with people seeing their urine output plummet to almost zero. As things worsen, pulmonary edema may even make an appearance.\n\nEven though the prevalence rate of this disease is high, detailed info on its incidence rate across all countries isn't readily available. On average, about 144 new cases per million pop up each year.\n\nDoctors typically turn to blood tests to suss out creatinine, potassium, and urea levels to diagnose the disease. Ultrasounds of the kidneys might be in the cards, and in some cases, doctors might suggest renal pelvis catheterization or kidney angiography.",
    "Animal circus performances exploit wild creatures, forcing them to perform unnatural tricks for entertainment. This practice is considered mockery and torture by animal rights activists, who advocate for a complete ban on animal exploitation in circuses. Laws have been established since the 1970s to protect the basic needs of sentient beings, recognizing that animals should express species-specific behaviors. Animals used in circuses are deprived of their natural freedoms, spending most of their time alone in cramped conditions. To respect animal rights, it is essential to prohibit their use in circuses and support their natural habitats.",
    "The Commitment to Health Theory is a unique model that identifies stages of development and behavioral changes related to leading a healthy lifestyle. It suggests that individuals develop an internal desire for health despite limitations in their circumstances. This theory, utilized by Kelly (2014), determines specific levels indicating different stages of health. It emphasizes building healthy behaviors regardless of factors like gender or race. Kelly (2008) incorporates principles from the Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change to illustrate stages of change and set health requirements. The Commitment to Health Theory includes principles such as stages of change, decisive balance, and self-efficacy (Prochaska & Velicer, 1997), which Kelly integrates into her work. In nursing practice, this theory can help assess patient indicators and establish goals to promote healthy lifestyle choices. It can also guide professionals in tracking the change process and interacting effectively with patients. The theory outlines stages where confidence is instilled, strategies implemented to reinforce healthy habits, and behavioral patterns introduced for maintaining wellness. By using stages of change and commitment ratings, healthcare providers can personalize therapy, utilize change-specific tactics, and employ motivating communication techniques to support patients effectively.",
    "Having expertise and experience in one's professional field is crucial, which is why many medical students aim to gain knowledge and skills before graduation. While focusing on theoretical and practical expertise is essential, I have realized the importance of building relationships with patients in the healthcare profession. This realization came to me while observing Dr. Wang, an experienced eye surgeon who excels in connecting with patients. Dr. Wang's ability to establish trust with patients is due to being an attentive listener, remaining courteous and patient, and showing genuine interest in their well-being. Witnessing the positive impact of building trusting relationships on patient care has inspired me to prioritize this aspect in my own practice. I hope that sharing Dr. Wang's example will encourage other healthcare professionals to also enhance their communication skills.",
    "The absence of nutritious food can influence grocery shopping choices. Conducting research at Wal-Mart in Forest Part provides insights into available products and prices. For instance, the prices of various items are as follows: one gallon of great value milk - $2.65, one Sara Lee bread loaf - $2.44, one bag of gala apples - $3.58, and one bag of organic baby carrots - $3.88. Additional prices include: one yogurt container - $1.92, 2-liter Pepsi Soda - $1.98, one bag of chips - $2.84, and one family-size pack of cookies - $3.98. In Maywood, IL 60153, the population comprises mainly African Americans (68.6%), alongside white residents (18.2%) and Hispanic/Latino individuals (26.9%) (United States Census Bureau, n.d.). This area faces a lack of quality grocery stores but has witnessed a rise in fast-food outlets over recent years. Consequently, residents struggle to access healthy food options, leading to health issues like hypertension and diabetes due to consuming poor-quality foods. Another significant social factor impacting health and shopping behavior is inadequate transportation and limited access to stores like Wal-Mart for the working class. The median household income in the area is approximately $50,176, with a poverty rate of around 15% (United States Census Bureau, n.d.). This financial situation restricts many individuals from purchasing nutritious food and jeopardizes their health. The interplay between transportation, income, and food issues is crucial for public health (Islam, 2019). Merely identifying problems is insufficient; solutions must be sought to assist the population in enhancing their circumstances. Community health nurses (CHNs) play a vital role in fostering public health and implementing interventions to combat food insecurity. According to Schffer and Strohschein (2019), there are 17 interventions categorized into five different groups, each represented by distinctive colors. Collaboration presents a unique chance for all community members to collectively advocate for and safeguard health. This collaborative intervention is characterized by a high level of commitment, partnership, and goal orientation (Schffer & Strohschein, 2019). Engaging in systemic collaboration enables CHNs to involve relevant stakeholders effectively, while community collaboration is essential for assessing the current situation. Family cooperation enhances personal knowledge and engagement, contributing to more significant health improvements.",

While some argue that computers add complexity and stress to life, I believe their advantages are clear. Computers facilitate fast and easy communication in our increasingly global society. Previously limited to slower methods like mail, the internet now enables instant messaging and email, boosting business efficiency and opportunities. Computers also serve as valuable leisure tools, offering entertainment and income-generating opportunities. Furthermore, in healthcare, computers play a crucial role in diagnoses and treatment methods, providing accurate imaging for internal organ structures through techniques like computed tomography and ultrasound diagnostics. The intervention of computers enhances the ease and effectiveness of healthcare processes.",
    "In the realm of building construction, the Code of Practice refers to a specific set of standards, procedures, and regulations that contractors and developers must follow to address potential environmental impacts stemming from construction activities. Primarily designed for large clients, local authorities, and public bodies in the context of new construction projects, this code outlines requirements regarding the environmental effects of construction activities. Its primary aim is to offer guidance within the legal, administrative, and technical frameworks to ensure the safety of workers, protection of the environment, and public welfare, as well as to oversee major hazard installations. By enforcing measures such as separating major hazard installations from densely populated areas like residential neighborhoods, schools, hospitals, and commercial zones, and creating emergency response plans, the code seeks to prevent major accidents that could jeopardize both the environment and public safety.\n\nThe Code of Practice specifically addresses major hazard installations that handle hazardous materials exceeding certain threshold quantities. These installations, which include facilities like oil refineries, petrochemical plants, chemical works, as well as storage sites for flammable liquids, gas, fertilizer works, chemical warehouses, and water treatment plants involving chlorine, are deemed high-risk due to their potential to cause serious incidents with significant environmental and human consequences. Notably, the code excludes nuclear and military hazards, as well as the transportation of hazardous chemicals due to differences in their regulatory frameworks and management practices.\n\nUnder the Code of Practice, there are various responsibilities assigned to competent authorities including government inspectorates, safety authorities, police, local government bodies, worker representatives, facility management, fire and health authorities, technology suppliers for major hazard installations, and other relevant organizations. They are mandated to carry out specific activities outlined in the code to establish robust control systems for managing major hazards and preventing incidents proactively.",
    "These days, there are a lot of discussions about whether Confederate statues should be kept or removed. Some believe these statues are important symbols of US history that need to be protected, while others argue that they should be taken down because they represent racial inequality and the dominance of White people. The evidence supporting the removal of Confederate statues is growing, especially considering that most of these monuments were not put up right after the Civil War but during a time when discriminatory laws against Black individuals were being passed. The organization responsible for building many of these statues, the United Daughters of the Confederacy, did so to promote White supremacy and reinforce racial disparities.\n\nIt's clear that there is a strong connection between these statues and racism, as they were mainly constructed during periods when Black Americans were fighting for their civil rights and facing violent acts like lynchings in the Southern states. These monuments were strategically placed in public spaces like courthouse grounds to send a message of White superiority and protection under the law.\n\nDue to the racial implications of these statues, many of them have been taken down or relocated in recent years to address the discrimination faced by Black individuals. While some argue for keeping a few statues to remember the past, it's important to acknowledge the negative aspects of history and work towards creating a more inclusive society in the future.",
    "Conflict in healthcare workplaces, as asserted by McKibben (2017), is an inevitable aspect intertwined with the intricacies of physical, mental, and ethical complexities. Unaddressed conflicts among colleagues can significantly diminish performance and satisfaction levels, ultimately impairing the quality of patient care (Suifan, Alhyari, & Sweis, 2020). To effectively manage disputes, it is crucial to understand their underlying causes. Conflicts in organizations can be traced back to individual, interpersonal, and organizational factors. Factors such as healthcare professionals' self-esteem, communication styles, and previous experiences play significant roles in determining conflict frequency and severity (Kim et al., 2017). Interpersonal conflicts, on the other hand, arise from issues like lack of trust, power abuse, and poor communication (Kim et al., 2017), while organizational conflicts are often rooted in poorly defined responsibilities and inadequate hierarchy (Kim et al., 2017; McKibben, 2017). Notably, personal experiences also shed light on the impact of self-focus, emotional control, and failure to establish clear responsibilities in causing conflicts. It is evident that effective conflict resolution is vital to maintain a healthy workplace environment and ensure smooth cooperation and productivity.",
    "In various philosophies, certain archetypes embody the ideal way of living life as the perfect self. In Confucianism, there exists a man referred to as the junzi — a noble person or gentleman — who is a sought-after ideal (Yu-kit 223). The junzi personifies the pinnacle of qualities that an exemplary human being should possess, a lofty goal that commands respect from many. This essay will delve into the essence of the Confucian gentleman and draw comparisons with Plato’s philosopher-king. Rooted in traditional Chinese culture, this concept remains profoundly significant for society, portraying a figure who transcends malevolent notions, confronts them, and mitigates their impact to the best of their ability (Yu-kit 225). Furthermore, the Confucian gentleman aids others in this endeavor by imparting knowledge (Yu-kit 223). According to Yu-kit, Confucius mandates that a noble person must assume the dual role of a role model and educator (224). Virtuous behavior comes naturally to this individual, with daily demonstrations of moral excellence. The Confucian gentleman adheres to the highest ethical standards and endeavors to guide others towards the realization of such ideals. Parallel to this ideal is Plato’s philosopher-king, who shares several similarities with this archetypal figure. Both epitomize positive moral virtues while addressing negativity through logic and reason. The philosopher-king is inherently modest and unyieldingly pursues wisdom for the benefit of society (Mark). Notably, Plato’s archetype emphasizes education over setting an example for others to follow in life. In essence, both roles embody qualities central to defining a noble person, including kindness, equity, altruism, and the pursuit of harmony. While Plato’s ideal person symbolizes a composed leader who values wisdom above all else, the Confucian gentleman prioritizes upholding moral principles. Their shared mission is to uplift the moral fabric of society through acts of kindness and selflessness.",
    "Corporate entrepreneurship involves groups within an established corporation that develop, cultivate, promote, and manage a new business distinct from the parent organization, while leveraging the parent's resources, competitive positioning, knowledge, and other capabilities. This innovative approach often blends unconventional methods with meticulous planning, frameworks, and organizational structures that many large firms have refined over time (Demirkan et al., 2019).\n\nLeading organizations like Amazon and Samsung, rather than resting on their laurels, are actively engaged in innovative projects to stay ahead of disruptive forces in the market. Amazon Custom, for instance, is a successful expansion of their ongoing innovative efforts, combining evolutionary and radical strategies to allow suppliers to offer personalized items on Amazon for the first time, thereby enhancing the customer experience (Demirkan et al., 2019).\n\nSamsung's innovative business strategy involves entrusting new initiatives to a specialized 'creative elite' group, ensuring the integration of best practices and optimal key performance indicators (KPIs) (Demirkan et al., 2019). This approach is supported by open innovation and corporate technical reconnaissance tactics, where new product advocates explore fresh ideas independently, following a bottom-up approach. A prime example of this strategy is the development of the iPod, which leveraged the company's internal talent and technical expertise in building the product in alignment with existing strategies.\n\nFurthermore, guided strategic behavior is implemented through a top-down process, channeling policies through the company's established hierarchical structure, as evidenced by the success of products like the iPhone. By fostering creativity and human effort, this strategy encourages individuals to contribute novel ideas, products, and processes to their roles, thereby becoming experts in their respective fields and driving innovation within the organization.",
    "Many modern and 1930s observers understood the inevitability of the Second World War. While some believed the United States could have averted the conflict, this was unlikely due to several factors. The U.S. maintained an isolationist stance in the 1930s, focusing on domestic concerns amidst global economic turmoil. With limited economic power and influence, the U.S. was unable to significantly impact European affairs. The war's origins lay in European tensions stemming from the dissatisfaction following the Treaty of Versailles, leading to the buildup of resources by countries like Germany. The rise of aggressive regimes in Europe made conflict almost certain, regardless of U.S. intervention. Thus, it is unlikely that the U.S. could have prevented the war even with a different foreign policy. Despite this, the U.S. played a crucial role in ending the conflict and shaping the post-war world order.",
    "This paper will analyze the article “COVID-19: Impact on Nurses and Nursing” by Fauteux (2021). The abstract serves as the opening of the article and gives readers a quick overview of the research results. The abstract in this article briefly covers the topic without delving into the methodology or results, making it less comprehensive. On the other hand, the introduction offers a broader overview of how the pandemic has affected nursing, including statistics to put the topic into perspective. I learned about various impacts of COVID-19 on nursing, such as increased mortality rates, changes in work practices, and heavier workloads.\n\nThe research method used in this article is qualitative, drawing on existing research to make empirical conclusions about the changes in nursing. The study presents quantitative data that has been analyzed to identify key factors influencing nursing practices, such as increased collaboration and innovation, removal of practice barriers, rise of telemedicine, and heightened risks of burnout (Fauteux, 2021).\n\nThe article sheds light on the significant effects of the pandemic on nursing, particularly the elevated risk of burnout due to increased workloads. It also discusses the rise of telemedicine in response to the pandemic, highlighting changes in patient attitudes towards healthcare. Overall, the article provides valuable insights into how the field of nursing evolves under challenging circumstances.",
    "Law enforcement has a long history that goes way back to when our main goal was just keeping each other safe and making sure everyone played by the rules. It's interesting to see how law enforcement has evolved over time. For instance, in the past, law enforcement officers had the power to use force when needed, all in the name of maintaining order. \n\nIn those early days, groups of folks would come together to make sure everyone was behaving, kind of like a neighborhood watch. The idea was to protect the community by enforcing the rules and cracking down on troublemakers. If someone messed with one person, it was seen as messing with the whole group.\n\nBack then, law enforcement had a few key things they focused on – no bullying, taking care of a bunch of different tasks, and making sure there was a clear line between who was in charge and who was doing the enforcing. Today, peace officers have an important job to do, making sure they follow the law both on and off duty. They're responsible for things like handling arrests, preserving evidence, and using informants, all while making sure they don't overstep their bounds.\n\nIt's a tough job with a lot of responsibility, but ultimately, it's all about keeping us safe and making sure everyone plays by the rules.",
    "The issue of slavery has had a profound and lasting impact on individuals of African descent over the years. In order to gain a comprehensive understanding of the concepts of racism and slavery, it is crucial to delve into their origins. In his chapter \"The Origin of Negro Slavery,\" Williams points out that slavery, although closely associated with the exploitation of African Americans today, initially involved individuals of various races and ethnicities being enslaved (Williams 7). The emergence of racism did not stem from targeted discrimination against African Americans initially, but rather from the imposition of forced labor practices. The history of slavery reveals that the first group subjected to such harsh treatment were the Indigenous peoples, notably the Indians. Spanish explorers, for instance, employed Indian labor in their colonies as a means of religious conversion, using slave labor as a tool to enforce adherence to Christianity among those who resisted (Williams 8). Similarly, Great Britain and France supported slavery in their colonial territories, not out of racial bias, but as a punitive measure against indigenous communities. However, over time, the economic value placed on enslaved Africans grew, leading to their prominence in the slave trade and the normalization of Negro slavery (Williams 21). As a consequence, racial prejudices against African Americans began to surface, driven by economic reasons rather than inherent racial biases. The interplay between slavery and racism can be traced back to the increasing reliance on enslaved African Americans for economic gains. It is crucial to acknowledge that racism did not precede slavery; rather, it emerged as a result of economic interests, with individuals from various racial and ethnic backgrounds participating in the slave trade. Nonetheless, the economic benefits derived from the enslavement of African Americans eventually gave rise to negative racial stereotypes and discriminatory practices, culminating in the development of racism as we now understand it.",
    "Culture encompasses social norms, behaviors, and customs that set apart a specific society from others. While some cultures share common traits, creating cultural clusters, leadership transcends national borders as a personality trait. Despite this, not all leaders exhibit the same behaviors, as they are also shaped by cultural norms. Variations in behavior can be seen in how different cultural clusters perceive time. The comparison between Middle Eastern and Western cultures, particularly American, is frequently discussed. Beehner notes that Middle Eastern nations tend to be past-oriented and value traditions, while many Americans believe in controlling the future and embracing change for the sake of change. Barack Obama serves as an exemplary leader who emphasized the importance of change. Differences in leadership behaviors go beyond future outlooks. Crede et al. found in their study that there are cultural disparities regarding transformational leadership, with the most interesting discovery being the stronger link between transformational leadership and subordinate performance in cultures with low levels of gender equality values. This suggests that in more traditional cultures, leaders may find greater success in transformational endeavors. In conclusion, culture significantly influences leadership behaviors, and the definition of culture should acknowledge its impact on leadership conduct. Culture not only differentiates social groups but also highlights the potential for leadership-driven transformations, considering that leaders are responsible for making crucial decisions in society.",

    "The process of establishing states is complex and involves various cultural strategies of power. Social agents play a crucial role in forming alliances and dominance relations, especially in regions like Western Europe, China, the Islamic World, and India. Understanding social strategies of power is essential in comprehending state formation. These strategies are defined as practices where media creators exert cultural influence and drive social change. They shape public opinion, which impacts state formation. The difference between state and stateless societies lies in power centralization, inequality, and citizenship. To grasp state emergence in different regions, it is vital to consider the culture strategy of power. In conclusion, social agents and their influence on public opinion are significant in the formation of states. The author explores the role of social anthropology and factors beyond European principles in this context.",
    "To change personal computers, more advanced hardware and software were needed. The buses, which are pathways for communication between different parts of the computer, have also become more complex. There are three types of buses - address, control, and data. Data buses help transfer data between the CPU and peripherals. The address bus helps the CPU find specific information in memory, while the control bus manages data processing. Data buses come in various sizes such as 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 bits, indicating how much information they can process at once. The more bits, the more data can be handled simultaneously. Common modern computer systems use 32 and 64-bit microprocessors. A 32-bit data bus has thirty-two lines, while a 64-bit data bus has sixty-four lines, allowing for faster data processing. The number of lines in a processor determines how many signals can be exchanged between components. The speed at which data is processed depends on the type of bus used.",
    "Data science is a fascinating discipline that delves into the captivating journey of digital data, from its emergence to its transformation into valuable insights across various fields of knowledge. This intricate field involves delving deep into vast amounts of information, with a keen focus on deriving actionable outcomes. The definition put forth by Os Keyes invites us to ponder on the intriguing notion that data science may inadvertently lead to the reduction of humanity to mere numbers and statistics. This perspective challenges the conventional understanding of data science, hinting at the intriguing idea that virtually everything in our world could potentially be quantified, given the discipline's emphasis on tangible objects and quantitative analysis.\n\nThere's a compelling notion that data science systems have an insatiable appetite for consuming vast amounts of information, potentially including aspects as personal as an individual's life experiences, all in the pursuit of measuring and quantifying them. This might imply a process where human input is gradually marginalized, leading to decisions that are stripped of human touch and empathy, eventually rendering them devoid of humanity. The prevalence of standardized tests, driven by rigid algorithms that leave no room for subjective expression, further emphasizes the inclination towards correctness in data-driven systems, potentially stifling individual creativity and flexibility.\n\nHowever, the indispensable role of data science shines through in critical sectors where avoiding errors is of paramount importance. For instance, within the healthcare domain, the integration of advanced electronic systems empowers healthcare professionals to make informed decisions regarding patient treatment, ensuring accuracy and precision. By leveraging data-driven insights, these systems can help mitigate medication errors that often arise from human oversights, such as neglecting to verify the expiry date of a medication. In contrast to human fallibility, data science systems provide reliable recommendations for optimal pharmaceutical choices, safeguarding patient well-being and enhancing medical outcomes.\n\nIn essence, while striking a delicate balance between the allure of data-driven precision and the need for human intuition, data science continues to revolutionize diverse fields with its transformative capabilities, paving the way for a more efficient and informed future.",
    "Modify the text with different words: It was truly surprising to come across Gerai's narrative on the Dayak community, as it presents a near-idealistic outlook on sex and gender. Unlike Western viewpoints that aim to separate the two genders and elevate one over the other, the Dayak acknowledge the distinctions but consider them advantageous. Upon reading the narrative, it appeared as though the culture promotes the empowerment of both genders through their defining attributes (such as male strength and female persistence). These positive traits are then combined to enhance the welfare of society and personal relationships through a nearly egalitarian viewpoint. While challenging to comprehend, it is reassuring to discover the existence of cultures like this. Unfortunately, many developed societies witness significant gender conflicts, associating negative attributes with the characteristics of genders; for instance, male strength is often linked with aggression, as noted by Gerai. It is pertinent to acknowledge that societal values shape individuals' behaviors. Western society typically places a premium on hypermasculinity and aggression as defining qualities of males, often manifested through sexual dominance, assault, or rape – thereby fostering a culture far removed from the equity and cohesion seen among the Dayak. Despite the shocking nature of this perspective, it accurately reflects the longstanding social constructs surrounding rape. Historically, rape has been attributed to natural biology, though it is more emblematic of societal norms. The narrative adeptly delves into both aspects, stressing the inherent qualities of genders (strength in men, femininity in women) while shedding light on the constructed social behaviors (praising men, viewing women as objects). Our society is predisposed to certain connotations and stereotypes related to sexual violence; for instance, a UK study found that the term \"victim\" was associated with passive femininity. This aligns with the feminization hypothesis regarding rape, where predominantly female victims are characterized with feminine traits and heightened judgment, possibly stripping them of their gender identity. Conversely, perpetrators of rape are often depicted with traits of exaggerated masculinity.",
    "When thrombosis strikes the veins of the lower extremities, blood clots form and wreak havoc on the flow of blood! These pesky clots can block blood vessels, break free, and travel to lungs, heart, and other organs (Dalen, 2016). Detecting the initial signs of leg vein thrombosis can be tricky, but keep an eye out for skin discoloration and swelling - these are red flags for vascular trouble. As thrombosis progresses, brace yourself for sharp leg pains and heaviness caused by congestion below the clot (Thachil & Bagot, 2018). Blood clotting and vein damage are the villains behind this condition, with long trips and age adding to the risk factor. Don't forget to check if the patient is on any meds that could be clot culprits! To nail down a proper diagnosis, whip out duplex scanning, radiopaque phlebography, or MRI - these tools will help craft the perfect treatment plan. Think heparin shots, anticoagulant capsules, or thrombolysis to dissolve those clots and keep surgery as the last resort. Remember, our aim is to tackle thrombosis head-on and protect the patient's well-being! Let's act fast, stay alert, and save lives! 🚀🩺🩹",
    "A Western scholarship has been distorting the rich history of African culture for centuries, viewing its fundamental principles through the lens of colonization. This has led to the appropriation and devaluation of African philosophy, turning it from an integral part of people's nature into mere commodities. Authors like p’Bitek and Marimba discuss how Western ideology has reshaped African culture, spirituality, and philosophy without truly grasping their significance. The commercialization of African culture and the imposition of European perspectives have disrupted the connection of African people to their identity. \n\np’Bitek argues that culture has been transformed from \"the way of life of a people\" into something to be bought and sold. Younger generations, especially those in Western countries, now see their culture as souvenirs rather than an essential part of everyday life. The Western influence, which values poverty and individualism, creates a sense of disconnect for African-Americans who struggle to reconcile their traditional African heritage with a European identity.\n\nThis clash of ideologies results in African culture being portrayed as a mere commodity, distancing generations of people from their roots and distorting their perception of their heritage. The authentic essence of African culture, tied to philosophy, spirituality, and a deep appreciation for life, is overshadowed by a superficial portrayal that caters to tourists. This disconnect leaves individuals feeling detached from their communal and generational ties, further eroding their connection to history and nature.",
    "In a narrow sense, the \"zero-sum story\" suggests that when one racial group progresses, it's seen as a threat to the resources and standing of another group. This belief, prevalent in conservative media, has negative impacts on the United States, leading to economic, political, and social costs. For instance, historical instances like public swimming pools being segregated in the past caused conflict when efforts were made to integrate them, resulting in closures or privatization. Additionally, some white individuals have resisted social policies once other racial groups benefit from them, leading to reduced social justice overall. The evidence presented by McGhee offers a compelling insight into the social and economic issues caused by racism in the US.",
    "Type 1 diabetes is typically caused by the autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells in individuals with a genetic predisposition. This damage occurs gradually over months or years as insulitis, leading to insulin deficiency and the inability to process glucose efficiently in muscle and fat tissues. The resulting imbalance triggers the release of hormones like glucagon, adrenaline, cortisol, and growth hormone, which promote processes like gluconeogenesis and ketogenesis in the liver, leading to hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis. On the other hand, type 2 diabetes is primarily characterized by insulin resistance, resulting in decreased cellular response to insulin and impaired glucose absorption. Management for both types of diabetes involves structured dietary plans with a focus on complex carbohydrates, avoidance of simple sugars, and medication such as Insulin Degludec for type 1 diabetes and Metformin for type 2 diabetes when needed.",
    "The HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY prioritizes patients' education, particularly for MINORITY GROUPS. McCurley et al. (2017) highlight that HISPANIC individuals benefit from FACE-TO-FACE sessions for improved diabetes prevention. This suggests that such interventions boost morale, motivation, and preventive measures. Face-to-face interactions allow patients to ask questions and realize they are not alone in their health issues. Face-to-face interventions may be suitable for my project on improving access to care for AFRICAN AMERICANS with heart failure.\n\nHowever, let's not overlook a broader perspective. Cajiita et al. (2017) found that mHealth promotes better health knowledge among older adults, including AFRICAN AMERICANS. The use of mobile technology can be as effective as face-to-face interactions, given people's online presence. It's sensible to utilize mHealth to enhance access to care for African Americans. COMBINING mobile technologies with face-to-face sessions may yield the best outcomes.",
    "To lower the risk of heart disease, cancer, and diabetes, individuals must follow strict dietary routines. As per the American Heart Association, a diet for heart disease prevention should avoid added sugars, excessive sodium, and saturated/trans fats. Focus on whole grains, vegetables (including frozen and canned varieties), nuts, seeds, as well as lean proteins like chicken and beef. The American Cancer Society recommends consuming more fruits and vegetables, particularly dark green and orange produce known for their cancer-fighting properties. Include high-fiber foods like legumes and whole grains while limiting red meats and added sugars. For diabetes prevention, the American Diabetes Association suggests emphasizing non-starchy vegetables (like broccoli, carrots, and cauliflower), making up half of every meal. Prioritize foods rich in protein (beans, hummus, lentils), along with fruits, monounsaturated fats, and polyunsaturated fats. Overall, all three organizations stress avoiding added sugars, trans fats, and saturated fats. A diet for preventing these conditions should include a variety of fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins while limiting red meat. Those with cancer should steer clear of red meat, while those with diabetes and heart disease can consume it moderately. People with diabetes should focus more on non-starchy vegetables. Individuals looking to prevent heart disease should pay close attention to fat intake.",
    "Watching the news or reading articles, you might notice the terms \"business\" and \"economics\" used interchangeably and wonder about their differences. Although business and economics are similar in that they complement each other, both involving the creation and sale of products and services to generate output, they serve as distinct but related fields of study. These disciplines share subtopics like enterprises, marketing, finance, manufacturing, and banking. Both disciplines are social sciences concentrating on financial measurement and analysis, assessing market influences and short- and long-term projections, as well as the operations of different industries. Additionally, business and economics address challenges faced by nations, citizens, government, and private enterprises. However, there are differences in their conceptual purposes. Economics delves into understanding human behavior and how it shapes broader economic aspects of nations, while business focuses on the exchange of goods and money, encompassing production, sales, and enterprise functions in this regard. Often seen as a subset of economics, business zeroes in on human behavior in the exchange process. The significant variance lies in their scopes: economics covers theories and macroeconomic factors like supply and demand, interest rates, and international trade, which impact business both at individual and industry levels. On the other hand, business concentrates on wealth creation within the economic framework, applying practical theories. Economics aims to enhance societal welfare, whereas business prioritizes shareholders' interests. The issues they address differ, with economics tackling poverty, unemployment, taxation, and government expenses, while business focuses on product strategies, marketing, profitability, growth patterns, and industry or individual performance. Though business and economics share similarities, their unique conceptual and operational distinctions set them apart as separate sciences.",
    "Discussing the differences between how doctors and nurses approach patient care can be an interesting topic, highlighting the unique features each profession emphasizes. In medical practice, the focus is more on the physical aspect of health, while nursing also considers the psychological responses of patients. This distinction can be clearly seen through the research approaches used in each field. Medical practice tends to rely on quantitative research, which is more factual and outcome-oriented, while nursing practice often involves mixed research that includes both opinions and data.\n\nOn the subject of diagnosis, an important difference lies in how lab results are emphasized in medical practice compared to nursing's focus on symptom assessment. By examining the accuracy of these approaches and comparing their outcomes, we can gain insights into the differences and similarities between nursing and medical care. Understanding these distinctions is crucial in improving patient care and decision-making in the nursing field.\n\nExploring a PICOT question related to preventing injuries and delivering personalized care in nursing can highlight the significance of decision-making in this profession. By considering factors like preventing falls versus only treating them, nurses can provide more tailored and patient-centered care. This personalized approach is essential in ensuring positive health outcomes and enhancing the quality of care provided to patients.",

    "The case of Bostock v. Clayton County was a big deal for preventing discrimination at work. It mainly focused on diversity related to sex and age, which can be a sensitive topic for many people. Looking at how Gerald Bostock was treated helped set better rules for how workplaces should operate. He was unfairly fired from his job just for being involved in a gay softball league, even though he was a valued employee. Bostock took legal action under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which was initially rejected by the court. However, he won on appeal by showing how Massachusetts law included protections against sexual discrimination. This changed how similar cases are treated in the future. This case was important in ensuring fair treatment for all employees, regardless of their background.",
    "Types of fake news range from apparent articles to more subtle deceptions, influencing critical decisions such as voting in elections or determining medical treatment. Trustworthy news is crucial to avoid confusion in social and political matters caused by the inability to differentiate between true and false information. False news often aims to fuel societal tensions, requiring critical thinking in online activities to combat emotional manipulation. To identify disinformation, fact-check sources, assess author credibility, and confirm the accuracy of information with data and expert statements before sharing.",
    "Bananas are a widespread and popular fruit with numerous health benefits, particularly in low-income countries. They serve as a valuable food source and cash crop, with Africa, Asia, and Latin America being the largest producers and exporters. Central and South America, as well as the Philippines, account for over 90% of all banana exports, with top importers including the EU, USA, China, Russia, and Japan. Global banana production is projected at 130 million tons annually, mainly consumed locally by farmers. However, issues arise in large-scale production impacting the environment and worker conditions, with conflicts over benefiting from the product. Large supply growth in Ecuador and the Philippines, as well as increased demand from China and the EU, drive global trade, influenced by direct operations of major retailers in the value chain. Management practices can lead to negative effects on the environment, worker health, and local communities.",
    "Transforming Budget Management for Optimal Performance An effective budget control system hinges on a resilient organizational setup. Key components such as a dynamic finance committee and a proficient budget director need to be put in place permanently. To prevent hurdles, it is imperative that budget planning is seamlessly integrated. Each individual budget should align harmoniously with others. Regular evaluations are crucial to ensure budgets do not become a free pass to exhaust funds unnecessarily. Dauda (2019) asserts that financial planning is indispensable for businesses aiming at prudent resource deployment to achieve organizational objectives. Rewarding employees according to their performance vis-a-vis the budget is essential. Conversely, leniency should not be shown towards unproductive staff. Understanding the Human Element in Budget Control While budgetary control is a pivotal tool for assessing performance, tangible results may take time to surface. Those overseeing fiscal management should possess comprehensive expertise in the domain. Employees are adapting their work patterns, routines, and relationships based on financial considerations. This shift can often breed reluctance to embrace change. hence, involvement of top leadership in budget creation is essential. Every employee's needs should be clearly detailed and disseminated within a structured framework, empowering them with the awareness of their roles and responsibilities that foster efficient budget management. The efficacy of a financial management strategy is intertwined with an organization's defined objectives. Consequently, management must exercise caution when setting targets, ensuring clarity in the defined goals.",
    "Gendered behavior encompasses fundamental manifestations of gender socialization and identity throughout an individual's developmental stages. It pertains to how individuals conduct themselves based on their respective male or female genders (Au & Rudolfsdottir, 2021). A significant gendered behavior that I acquired in childhood was the belief that women are primarily responsible for cooking in the household. As a result, I learned to cook for the family from a young age, unlike many male relatives. This concept was reinforced by portrayals in movies where women were predominantly shown as the cooks in the household. Another gendered role that I quickly embraced as a child was the perception that women are innately compassionate caregivers. This role depicted women as empathetic individuals who prioritize the well-being of others in both the home and society, actively working to alleviate suffering. Women were seen as warm, nurturing, and compassionate, leading to professions requiring empathy such as nursing and teaching being considered predominantly female domains. The notion that women possess a greater degree of humanity and compassion resonated with me and influenced my acceptance of this role. In my view, this role acknowledged a reality that many prefer to overlook: the essential role that women play in preserving sanity in the world. To me, it signified that women could significantly contribute to reducing oppression, suffering, and cruelty existing from childhood. Consequently, the perception that women are more caring and naturally nurturing appealed to me by elevating the gender to a position of nobility. However, despite the perceived nobility associated with the gender role of being nurturing and caring, there were specific negative consequences in terms of employment opportunities, as previously mentioned. Women were often deemed unsuitable for certain well-paying positions such as piloting, engineering, and medical doctors. Society tended to restrict women to professions like nursing and teaching, with patients commonly assuming that women caregivers were nurses rather than doctors in healthcare settings, leading to potential conflicts when choosing career paths.",
    "Lots of historical events and time periods have specific names, you know? Like the Renaissance or the Stone Age - all of those were labeled for a reason, to set them apart and show the differences between each era. One really good example of this trend is the Industrial Revolution. They also call it industrialization. It was a pretty big deal in history, making huge strides in technology and society. And it all went down quicker than you can say \"100 years.\" They use the word “revolution” in “industrial revolution” to really nail down the idea that it was a massive and rapid change in society. Just like a real revolution, it shook things up for people and how they lived. By changing how work was done and viewed, it completely flipped how folks thought about the economy, jobs, and pretty much the world. For entrepreneurs and those wanting to start up their own businesses, industrialization became the go-to for income, phasing out manual labor. It opened doors for new ways of production and the ability to do large-scale manufacturing. Introducing all that fancy machinery really impacted workers too, pushing unskilled labor out and making education and skills a bigger deal. Some folks lost jobs in the process, but it also gave others fresh job opportunities by moving them into cities. Industrialization helped shape cities and played a big part in making them hubs for people interactions. On a grander scale, the ability to mass produce goods and services helped countries grow their economies, boost trade, and build stronger bonds with their neighbors. The industrialization era had its highs and lows, but you can't deny how important it was to shaping the society we have now.",
    "The Miranda warning, also known as Miranda rights, is a crucial notification given to individuals who are being arrested in the United States. It informs the person of their basic civil rights, such as the right to remain silent and to have an attorney present. These rights are protected by the United States Constitution to ensure a fair legal process for both the defendant and the prosecution. Failure to provide the Miranda warning can lead to the exclusion of the defendant's testimony in court due to concerns of coercion. While exceptions may be made in cases involving dangerous criminals or immediate threats to public safety, Miranda warnings remain essential to uphold the principle of transparent legal proceedings. If not initially given at the time of arrest, these rights will be provided later before formal legal proceedings begin.",
    "The professional duties of a doctor involve adhering to a code of ethics rooted in principles such as patient loyalty and honoring their decisions. While medical practice is influenced by various philosophical, religious, and cultural ideologies, the concept of physician-assisted suicide presents a complex ethical dilemma. This practice involves a healthcare provider assisting a patient in a voluntary death, by offering necessary information and resources to fulfill the individual's end-of-life wishes. However, ethical considerations dictate that a doctor's involvement in such actions should not be conditional.\n\nThe contentious issue of euthanasia arises, highlighting the potential for irreversible harm if the procedure is not executed with utmost care and precision. Allowing physician-assisted suicide could deprive individuals of the opportunity for continued existence, generating moral conflicts concerning the sanctity of life. Although some patients with terminal illnesses may desire to end their suffering through euthanasia, medical professionals are ethically bound not to facilitate such actions. Violating the fundamental moral principle of refraining from taking another person's life undermines the essence of the medical profession, which is fundamentally rooted in providing care and healing.\n\nTaking into account the Hippocratic oath, which emphasizes the obligation to avoid causing harm, aiding a patient in fulfilling a death wish can be perceived as an act of intentional harm. Furthermore, the act of assisted suicide may erode the trust between patients and healthcare providers, as it contradicts ethical standards and societal norms regarding the sanctity of life. Religious perspectives also condemn the assistance in ending a life, citing moral injunctions against killing. Medical practice advocates for alleviating patient suffering through palliative care and available treatments, as the irreversible nature of death underscores the gravity of such actions.",
    "The project endeavors to delve into the inquiries surrounding individuals' sexual orientation identification and the underlying factors contributing to it. While some regard sexuality as a matter of choice, others posit that one's attractions cannot be governed by external circumstances. The latter group asserts that sexuality is inherently biological, constituting a fundamental aspect of one's identity deserving of governmental protection (Sheldon et al., 2017).\n\nTo explore varied viewpoints on this subject, the project frames its research question as follows: Does the environment influence individuals' sexual orientation? Through an examination of this research topic, pertinent dependent and independent variables associated with the subject have been outlined utilizing the GSS database. The dependent variable, \"sexort,\" represents respondents' sexual orientation, with the accompanying question seeking to determine the respondent's self-identification. This variable was selected for its relevance in discerning the environmental context in which the respondent exists.\n\nConversely, the independent variable pertinent to the project's topic is \"sexbirth,\" signifying the sex assigned at birth. The related GSS query for this variable asks respondents about the sex recorded on their birth certificate. The selection of the sexbirth variable is crucial for identifying respondents' sexuality and individuals with homosexual orientations for the research. A notable interrelation exists between these variables, potentially enhancing the project's research outcomes.\n\nSignificantly, individuals' sexual identification substantially influences their lives and interactions, with environments around males and females often exhibiting critical distinctions. Consequently, these divergent environmental impacts can influence individuals' alignment with their sexual orientation.",
    "One of the primary responsibilities of a business leader is to carefully choose the most optimal course of action from various options during the decision-making process. This task is intricately linked to having a deep understanding of the business environment in which the company operates. When it comes to introducing products to the market for consumer consumption, experts frequently turn to the supply and demand theory as a guiding principle.\n\nThe supply and demand theory is employed to discern customer purchasing behaviors, enabling managers to devise effective marketing strategies to promote their products effectively in the market. For example, if there is a low demand for a particular product, it indicates that the supply should be reduced. Conversely, an increase in demand suggests that the supply should be ramped up accordingly. Furthermore, the analysis of supply and demand is instrumental in pricing strategies. Higher demand typically allows for price increases as customers are more willing to make purchases. Conversely, in cases of low demand, prices need to be kept competitive to prevent losses for the producer.\n\nThere are numerous strategies that leverage the supply and demand model to gain a competitive edge in the market. An illustrative case is De Beers, a company specializing in diamond jewelry, which maintains high prices by controlling the supply of diamonds. By limiting the availability of diamonds, the company effectively maintains their allure as a luxury item, enticing consumers to pay a premium for them. Another example is Zappos, known for its online shoe retailing model that eliminates the ability to try on shoes before purchase. By offering a vast selection, exceptional customer service, and a flexible return policy, Zappos has successfully utilized supply control to build customer loyalty.\n\nApple, a prominent player in the tech industry, capitalizes on building excitement and anticipation around product releases to create demand among consumers. This strategy positions their products as more than just gadgets, but as part of a larger cultural phenomenon. In conclusion, the supply and demand theory serves as a valuable tool for guiding businesses in navigating the market effectively; strategic implementation is key to maximizing its potential benefits for products and services.",
    "The impact of social networks is on the rise, overshadowing traditional media. Twitter, in particular, has emerged as a powerful tool for sharing real-time information and sparking discussions on various subjects. However, tweets vary in their effects on society. This study analyzes a tweet by Australian politician Bill Shorten regarding the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS). While the tweet highlights a positive event, it also voices concerns about the limitations affecting NDIS operations. The message aims to inform as well as express grievances. Shorten laments the government's policies, which restrict NDIS assistance to individuals. Despite containing mixed sentiments, the tweet can have a constructive impact. Criticism from a prominent figure like Shorten can raise awareness and prompt societal and governmental action. The tweet garnered significant engagement with 209 retweets, 50 comments, and 858 likes, indicating its influence. However, the issue's overall popularity remains modest within the Australian population. Evaluating Shorten's authority, it is evident that as a seasoned politician, he possesses the knowledge and experience to offer an informed perspective. Therefore, the tweet may drive discussions about NDIS activities but might not create a substantial impact at a national level.",
    "There is a growing number of physicians encountering victims of human trafficking, sometimes without recognizing them as such. Recently, Todres (2017) reported an incident in which Dr. W was asked to screen women-employees of a firm for sexually transmitted infections. \n\nAccording to the Code of Medical Ethics of the American Medical Association (2011), it is essential to safeguard patient confidentiality, including physical, informational, decisional, and associational privacy. However, Dr. W was instructed not to keep records to prevent the possible arrest of these women. This situation led to concerns about the lack of proper healthcare for the firm's employees and the potential spread of STIs.\n\nThe case raises issues in criminal law, ethical concerns, human rights, and service provider regulations. Under conspiracy law, Dr. W's agreement could be viewed as participation in the crime since she was aware of it and did not report it. From a human rights perspective, prostitution is illegal in the US, and if minors are involved, mandatory reporting laws apply (Todres, 2016).\n\nIn such cases, ethical considerations may involve breaching confidentiality to help a child. Ultimately, encountering human trafficking requires a nuanced decision-making process. By supporting an enterprise involved in human trafficking, a physician may bear some responsibility for crimes and the exploitation of women and children. Thus, it is important to follow legal frameworks and ethical guidelines, including reporting such cases when necessary.",
    "Feminist ethics asserts that women should not be subordinate and that women's moral experiences are equally important as men's. The practical aims of feminist ethics, according to Vaughn (2019), include critiquing behaviors and attitudes that reinforce women's rights, offering ways to oppose such behaviors, and envisioning a morally good alternative to promote female empowerment. Academic discussions about feminist ethics emerged in the late 1960s, focusing on issues like abortion, fairness, equality, domestic work, sexual violence, and heterosexuality. The term \"feminist ethics\" became widely used in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Feminists believed traditional ethics had a male bias and needed radical reconsideration. Feminism constantly engages in ethical debates, challenging its own meaning. Feminist obstacles include lack of consideration for women's interests and moral agency, as well as stereotypes that limit the scope of feminist ethics. In reality, feminist ethics is broader and more diverse than these stereotypes suggest. Modern feminists are exploring new ways of thinking about morality that acknowledge the unique importance and shared value of women, such as their humanity, fairness, and impartiality.",
    "Domestic violence and abuse involve aggressive behavior, like beating and humiliation, from one family member towards another. It is a common issue today, affecting millions of Americans each year. Victims of abuse feel depressed, helpless, and may hide the abuse out of fear.

Suspected cases should be reported to the appropriate authorities for investigation and intervention.",
    "The fashion industry is renowned for its ever-evolving nature, stemming from the multifaceted demands of its clientele. Fashion is not just a form of self-expression, but also a signifier of social standing, culture, and individuality. Consequently, customers are inherently interested in acquiring trendy garments that cater to various preferences while remaining within a defined budget. Despite the availability of numerous clothing retailers offering a wide array of fashionable items, oftentimes, off-the-rack designs fail to fully capture a customer's personality and specific requirements. Major players in the industry, such as Zara and H&M, invest substantially in understanding their customers' distinctive needs. Nonetheless, their ability to address these needs on a global scale remains limited, leading to a notable portion of the target audience settling for what is readily accessible.\n\nTherefore, it is imperative to bridge the existing gap between customers' expectations from their favored clothing outlets and the offerings available in the market to enhance overall customer satisfaction. Our initiative, Be-Unique, aims to address this challenge by harnessing technology to bring services closer to the clientele. The primary objective of this project is to establish a highly integrated platform that enables customers to engage digitally with their preferred fashion retailers. This platform is poised to revolutionize the fashion landscape by enabling customers to submit their unique design preferences for customization. Conventional online apparel from stores like Zara and H&M typically adheres to standard sizing conventions that may not cater to all body types encompassed within these standard dimensions.

To this end, we are committed to providing patrons with the opportunity to furnish their measurements on our platform, facilitating the crafting of bespoke garments that align with their specific proportions.\n\nOur proficient team stands ready to assist customers in obtaining accurate measurements and liaising with prominent clothing establishments for the purpose of customization.",
    "The editing in the first episode of Money Heist aligns with its thrilling plot and rapid action. Quick editing and close-ups focus on items that are essential to the narrative, such as guns, money, and character motives. The dynamic close-ups and dolly shots keep the camera moving, especially during monologues to maintain tension. Characters are rarely centered in close-ups, following a vertical thirds composition. Hand-held shots convey emotions like insecurity or aggression, while steady dolly shots capture action and interpersonal drama effectively. The alternating camera movements create suspense and keep the focus on characters rather than the surroundings.",
    "The Supreme Court found that Static Control's claim regarding a violation of the Lanham Act's false advertising provision was valid. The Court had to interpret the statutory language to determine the scope of the provision. The characterization of the claim as a prudential standing issue by Lexmark was inaccurate. The Court focused on statutory interpretation rather than on prudential standing arguments. The statute aims to protect businesses from unfair competition and reputational harm. To prove a commercial injury under the Lanham Act, a plaintiff must demonstrate harm within the statute's intended scope of protection. The Court emphasized that the proximate cause of the violation must be directly related to the plaintiff's injuries. Static Control's allegations of lost sales and harm to its business reputation fell within the scope of the statute.",
    "Marketing is crucial for attracting new customers, but unethical practices, such as targeting uninformed consumers like children, the elderly, and individuals with psychological conditions, can lead to adverse outcomes. It is unethical to manipulate these vulnerable populations into purchasing unnecessary items, as they may struggle to discern false information provided by marketers. While some argue that targeting uninformed consumers opens up new markets, it is important to recognize their vulnerability and avoid exploiting them. Organizations should refrain from targeting these populations due to their lack of psychological maturity, which can result in unreasonable decisions and purchases.",
    "The European nations had acquired vast territories around the world, including the Caribbean. In the 15th century, Europeans took control of the region after the establishment of Spanish settlements and the defeat of the Aztec and Inca empires (Horne, 2018). With the ease of exploration facilitated by the conquests, the Spanish were able to expand into Mexico and Peru through strategic points in the Caribbean. Subsequently, following the Spanish presence in the Caribbean during the 17th century, other European powers like the British and French began settling in key locations such as Tortuga island and later moving to Jamaica (Horne, 2018). By the mid-17th century, numerous non-Hispanic privateers had set up permanent colonies and trading posts on the Caribbean islands. The lucrative opportunities for wealth acquisition fueled the colonization of the Caribbean region. Initially, the discovery of gold, a valuable resource in the area, presented a major incentive for colonization. The arrival of Christopher Columbus in the region paved the way for other leaders to establish colonies (Horne, 2018). Additionally, the presence of a labor force from Africa, specifically enslaved black individuals, who were utilized in industrial activities, further fueled European colonial expansion in the area. The decline of Spanish influence in the region, partly due to the diminishing native populations, allowed other European powers to increase their presence in the territories explored by Columbus. Figures like Francis Drake, an English privateer, targeted Spanish settlements, enhancing the competition among European powers in the Caribbean (Horne, 2018). The cooperation among the French, British, and Dutch further facilitated the conquest of the Caribbean by European nations. As colonization intensified and competition between the colonies grew, conflicts arose, resulting in fierce wars that hindered Caribbean unity against European dominance (Horne, 2018). The rise of agricultural pursuits and the expansion of the Atlantic slave trade led to an influx of African laborers working for the Europeans in the Caribbean, strengthening the grip of colonial powers in the region and solidifying their conquest.",

    "This film delves into the vulnerability of masculinity, men’s mental well-being, and their interconnectedness. \"Fight Club\" portrays how men's vulnerabilities can escalate into toxic masculinity. The characters in the film, mostly raised by single mothers due to absent fathers, highlight a lack of male guidance in their lives which affects their perception of masculinity. The movie explores themes of phallocentrism and men's struggle to find their identity in modern society. It challenges traditional notions of masculinity by associating it with self-destruction and societal impact, ultimately suggesting that goodness can triumph over destructive traits. The character development of Jack showcases an evolution of masculinity towards self-sacrifice and taking responsibility, hinting at a positive outlook despite the ambiguous ending.",
    "In the 19th century, the landscape of nursing in Europe was transformed by the remarkable Florence Nightingale. Amid societal expectations, Florence defied convention to pursue her calling of aiding the less fortunate. Sacrificing personal relationships and societal norms, she dedicated herself to nursing, paving the way for a new era of healthcare. Her unwavering dedication led her to F. Flender's nursing community in Germany, where she honed her skills and values, shaping her into a pioneering figure in healthcare. Florence's contributions extended beyond cholera treatment and wartime aid, encompassing leadership development and nursing reform. Her legacy as a beacon of selfless service and international compassion reshaped perceptions of nursing's nobility and significance. With her image adorning medals of honor for exemplary nurses, Florence continues to inspire generations of caregivers worldwide. The evolution of nursing globally owes much to trailblazers like Florence and the Red Cross. The vision of compassionate care and relief efforts crystallized during the historic Geneva conference of 1863, setting a precedent for humanitarian organizations worldwide. The establishment of nursing schools in the USA, modeled after Nightingale's pioneering efforts, marked another milestone in the evolution of healthcare. From the inception of the American Medical Association to the proliferation of nursing education institutions, Florence's influence reverberates through the annals of healthcare history, underscoring the transformative power of visionary leadership.",
    "Diana Kendall argues that the media constructs and perpetuates class-based stereotypes, legitimizing inequality in the United States. The upper class is portrayed positively, while the lower class is framed negatively, leading to a skewed perspective on societal classes. This portrayal impacts human behavior and quality of life, as the media focuses on the concerns of the upper class while neglecting those of the lower class. The media's discourse on the homeless and the poor associates their lifestyle with laziness, diseases, and substance abuse, further dehumanizing them and overlooking contributing factors like unemployment and ignorance. This detachment contributes to the deterioration of life quality for low-class individuals, as their needs are continuously overlooked in favor of the concerns of the upper class.",
    "Despite being portrayed as a villain due to its murderous nature, the Monster in Mary Shelley's classic novel possesses a complexity that goes beyond its gruesome exterior. Described as both hideous and powerful, the creature is also depicted as inexperienced and struggling to navigate a world that rejects it. Far from being inherently evil, the Monster's actions are born out of a sense of isolation and a longing for the love and acceptance it so desperately craves.\n\nShelley weaves Gothic elements throughout the narrative, exploring themes of the supernatural, medieval architecture, and the depths of human emotion. Through the lens of Victor Frankenstein and his creation, readers are invited to delve into the moral complexities of society and the consequences of societal rejection on individual behavior.\n\nThe Monster's journey mirrors the struggles of individuals who find themselves misunderstood and ostracized by society, highlighting the profound impact of loneliness on one's actions and psyche. As Shelley's tale unfolds, it serves as a poignant reminder of how societal attitudes and treatment towards outcasts can shape their path towards darkness.\n\nIn a world that often shuns those who deviate from the norm, \"Frankenstein\" challenges readers to reflect on the power of compassion, empathy, and understanding in shaping the destinies of both outcasts and society as a whole.",
    "The idea of \"gender roles\" is often used to understand writings from different historical times. During the Anglo-Saxon period, these roles were clearly defined. The poem Beowulf is an epic that celebrates brave characters and their actions. Women in Beowulf are shown as possessions of men and are mainly there to support male characters and move the story along. They play minor roles compared to male characters who dominate the storyline. For example, the queen of the Swedes is unnamed and known only as King Onela's wife. Male characters like Hrothgar, Beowulf, Wiglaf, and Unferth are the focus of the poem. Women are rarely mentioned, reflecting the societal expectations of the time. The poem describes a woman taking care of her family and others, emphasizing the traditional role women were expected to play in the 11th century. Queen Modthryth is contrasted with Queen Hygd, who is independent and disliked by men until she marries Offa. Modthryth is seen as acceptable only after she marries, highlighting the idea that women were valued more when married.",
    "Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are a controversial topic. While some believe altering genetic information is unethical and akin to playing God, I view GMOs as a natural progression, similar to the development of machines or vehicles. I have personally consumed GMO products without concerns about long-term effects, seeing them as a result of selective breeding practised for centuries. My support for GMOs is based on utilitarianism, which suggests that if something benefits as many people as possible, it is ethical. GMOs can address issues like famine by producing crops that are resistant to harsh conditions, thus increasing food production to feed millions in need. While some argue against GMOs on moral grounds, citing interference with genetic codes as wrong, I believe that utilizing innovative tools, as instructed by Christian principles to care for all creatures, is a responsible approach.",
    "The phenomenon of internationalizing companies has been a key focus of management researchers. In recent years, the spotlight has shifted from mere analysis of benefits and risks to a profound examination of the operational strategies adopted by international firms. It is crucial to recognize that globalization serves as an institutional backdrop for these companies, marked by heightened uncertainty, multifaceted risks, and a continuously evolving landscape.\n\nThe primary driver for a company's global expansion lies in the vast array of market opportunities for production and trade. Implementing an international strategy not only expands market reach but also unlocks economies of scale, fostering learning, and leveraging the advantages of new locations. Notably, various firms from emerging economies like China, India, and Taiwan actively participate in the high-tech segments of global value chains.\n\nHowever, this escalating trend underscores the extensive array of challenges faced by international companies in these nations, such as inadequate regulatory oversight leading to unethical practices. For instance, the exploitation of cheap local labor for cost-effective production is a glaring ethical issue that can haunt companies in the long run.\n\nDespite the allure of international diversification, some firms opt to remain domestic due to apprehensions about global risks or a myopic focus on their home market. These decisions may stem from the complexities associated with foreign markets, including cultural nuances and consumer behavior.\n\nTherefore, while a global strategy offers substantial benefits, it presents inherent risks and challenges that may dissuade firms from embracing this approach.",
    "Gnomial Functions Inc. needs to forecast sales for the next eighteen months. The sales have been consistently increasing over the past 18 months with little seasonal variation. Recent sales have a significant impact on future sales. It is recommended that Gnomial Functions Inc. use a weighted moving average method for sales forecasting. This method uses four different weights, ranging from 0.1 to 0.4 for the earliest and most recent months, respectively. Giving a higher weight to recent data results in more accurate forecasts compared to using simple moving averages. By adjusting the weights for the moving average, the company can further improve the accuracy of its forecasts. For instance, changing the weights to prioritize recent performance resulted in lower mean absolute deviation and mean standard error values. This approach outperformed the simple moving average method. Using the weighted moving average is recommended for predicting sales over the next year. It is a simple, effective, and reliable method that can be adjusted to reflect changes in the sales trend. Gnomial Functions Inc. should therefore use the weighted moving average approach to estimate future sales performance.",
    "The modern global economy is so vast and diverse that predicting when a crisis will occur is extremely challenging. A recession poses a serious threat, leading to stress and triggering basic survival instincts in individuals. Crisis intervention, a relatively new field, aims to provide temporary emergency emotional support to those affected by mental and physical trauma (Colford & Cavaiola, 2017). The current risk of economic decline could have a significant impact on the entire population, which is why I hope to avoid experiencing a recession as it would greatly disrupt my life.\n\nThose working for non-profit organizations are particularly vulnerable to the effects of a crisis, with an increase in layoffs potentially forcing many to rely on state assistance. Job scarcity contributes to the crisis, leading to heightened poverty levels and individuals being forced to leave their homes. As people struggle to afford basic necessities and rent, a recession is seen as a highly undesirable event due to its destructive consequences.\n\nFrom a professional perspective, a crisis impacts not only individual businesses but entire sectors of the economy and the national economy as a whole. The crisis leads to higher credit costs and difficulties in obtaining credit resources, along with the risk of strained relationships with international partners. Overall, the crisis is viewed as a negative occurrence due to its severe impacts and unpredictable outcomes.",
    "The YouTube video \"GP Training in Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services\" powerfully highlights the vital role Aboriginal Medical Services play in their diverse community. These essential services provide culturally sensitive and high-quality care to marginalized populations, equipping them to combat pressing health issues. Through a comprehensive range of services, these facilities ensure that Aboriginal patients have access to affordable and convenient healthcare that addresses various aspects of their lives. By adopting a holistic approach to culturally sensitive care, these services effectively tackle the social determinants of health (SDOH) impacting the population's well-being and quality of life. Addressing disparities and inequities faced by Aboriginal patients, these health services emphasize patient education, early prevention, and effective management of health challenges. In particular, the video discusses discrimination as a prominent SDOH, underscoring the importance of providing culturally sensitive services to foster patient trust and encourage care continuity. While implementing such care is challenging, the rewards of building meaningful relationships with patients and advocating for their healthcare needs are immeasurable. By nurturing a collaborative environment, Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services professionals support underserved patients, striving to create a more accepting and understanding healthcare setting. This ongoing process demands dedication and a focus on the unique requirements of patients seeking culturally sensitive care, ultimately promoting the health and well-being of the Aboriginal community.",
    "The cultural ramifications of Roman hegemony over the Greek-speaking territories constitute a compelling subject that has garnered significant scholarly attention, particularly in recent years. The effects of the cultural interchange between the two civilizations were contingent upon temporal and spatial considerations, with a more pronounced impact observed in locales where Roman settlements had taken root. These settlements served as conduits of influence, facilitating the gradual integration of Roman elements into the public sphere through their prolonged cohabitation with Greek populations. One such element was the adoption of Roman nomenclature, a phenomenon attributed to the existence of trade networks and the significance of personal identity attached to names. Rizakis (2019) distinguishes between the assimilation of Greeks into the Roman naming conventions and the subsequent incorporation of Roman names by foreign-born Greeks as distinct yet illustrative aspects of the intercultural exchange process, culminating in the emergence of a shared onomastic culture. This process of acculturation, which peaked in the 2nd century AD, exhibited considerable regional variation, with differing degrees of reception across various urban centers and social strata. The dissemination of these cultural elements was primarily orchestrated by the civic elite with the aim of perpetuating their influence through nomenclature, both locally and on a broader systemic level. The utilization of the tria nomina system, particularly during the imperial era, symbolized status, authority, and prestige, according to Rizakis (2019). Consequently, certain names gained popularity as markers of a common cultural identity, albeit with their original meanings often obscured, even extending to limited adoption by lower social strata. However, the predominance of Roman names as insignia of Roman citizenship endured only briefly. By the close of the 3rd century AD, as noted by Rizakis (2019), a novel mode of identity expression emerged—employing distinct Greek and Roman names together. Initially a rarity, this practice proliferated following the era of Constantine, particularly during late antiquity, becoming the norm across Roman provinces. This shift, propelled by the rise of Christianity and the waning influence of the Roman Empire, may be interpreted as a reversion to the Greek naming conventions.",
    "Health promoters constitute a professionally trained workforce whose primary aim is to enhance health through a myriad of activities conducted by health promotion organizations. Individual empowerment, societal accountability for health, and the establishment of a conducive environment for developing personal skills and enhancing community action rank among their primary objectives (Nutbeam, 2019). In the domain of health promotion, experts comprising various multidisciplinary healthcare professionals have reached a consensus on the attributes of effective collaboration and an interdisciplinary approach. The principal purpose of interdisciplinary teams lies in amalgamating a wide array of diverse perspectives on healthcare and leveraging the expertise and knowledge of various individuals and sectors. Intersectional collaboration among diverse healthcare professionals, as well as public and commercial sectors, is crucial for the effectiveness of health promotion (US Department of Health and Human Services, 2018).\n\nThe inclusivity of these components underscores that an individual's health is not solely contingent upon medical services or the efforts of nurses and physicians (Nutbeam, 2019). The extensive spectrum of activities encompassed within health promotion demands a diverse range of skills from numerous healthcare professionals and sectors. The integration of multidisciplinary specialists within the health promotion team, such as Nurse Practitioners (NPs), Social Workers (SWs), and Registered Nurses (RNs), will prove beneficial over the short and long term. Nurse practitioners, characterized by their advanced education and training, possess the capability to address a broad spectrum of medical conditions alongside offering preventative care and health education (Pun, 2018). Social workers, armed with specialized training, are adept at assisting individuals and groups in skill development and issue resolution. Whether the challenges are personal, interpersonal, or societal in nature, social workers play a vital role in guiding and addressing numerous contemporary issues (Nutbeam, 2019).\n\nOn the other hand, Registered Nurses (RNs) meticulously evaluate healthcare needs to determine the most suitable service or treatment, the optimal healthcare provider, as well as the most effective equipment for delivering patient care (Pun, 2018). Thus, the skills and methodologies they bring to the table are pivotal for the success of an interdisciplinary team entrusted with health promotion initiatives.",
    "During the late 1950s and early 1960s, the music scene underwent significant changes reflecting the evolving society. This period marked a shift in the music industry, giving rise to two distinct markets. The first market catered to the younger generation who enjoyed dance music, while the second market appealed to former rock and rollers who gravitated towards folk music with themes of social and political relevance.\n\nFolk music, with its long history of addressing societal issues, appeared more community-focused compared to mainstream pop. Folk performers connected with their audiences, embodying the spirit of the people they represented. The simplicity of folk music, often needing just basic guitar chords, made it accessible to a wide range of people. This led to the idea that folk music was created \"for the people, by the people.\"\n\nThe folk movement attracted several influential figures, such as The Weavers, led by legendary performers like Pete Seeger. Their focus on social problems and the simplicity of their music resonated with audiences, particularly college students. The Kingston Trio emerged as one of the most popular groups, driving the folk revival into the mainstream pop market. Their approach to folk music appealed to a broader audience, shaping the perception of folk music for many listeners.\n\nOverall, folk music became a powerful medium for expressing societal concerns and connecting with people on shared issues. The movement was championed by notable singers who used their music to address important societal challenges.",
    "The Roman Empire embraced a rich polytheistic belief system, where people reverenced a pantheon of diverse gods believed to influence Roman society and individual destinies (Bartsch, 2020). Given Rome’s strategic location, interactions with the Greeks, who had expanded into Italy and Sicily, fostered an exchange of cultural practices, with the Romans adapting Greek customs to their needs (Beard, 2015). Polybius highlighted the consolidation of Roman governance in the Consul's office as a monarchy while narratives in The Dream of Scipio by Hippomanes, de Noyen, and Barneuve philosophically explore themes of personal accountability and redemption through comprehension, not just actions or faith (Ruden, 2013). Rome’s system included two chancellors who oversaw different divisions of the army, holding annual acclaim and the power to propose initiatives to the Senate. Citizenship was a nuanced concept in Rome, determined by gender, lineage, and social status, where full citizenship was typically exclusive to males born to citizen parents (Beard, 2015). In contrast, United States citizenship can be acquired through birth on U.S. soil, parental citizenship, or marriage, providing a multifaceted approach to achieving national identity.",

    "In the article \"The impact of peers in adolescence: Can derogatory name-calling by peers influence gender identity?\" the authors suggest that negative name-calling by peers could lead to a shift in gender identity. They argue that such experiences could prompt individuals to identify more with peers of the opposite sex due to negative interactions with same-sex peers, particularly during the formative adolescent years where identity is still evolving. DeLay et al. (2018) acknowledge that both homosexual and heterosexual adolescents can face homophobia, as the intention behind victimization is to cause emotional harm rather than to address actual flaws. Gender identity development, occurring during adolescence, is a pivotal phase in shaping one's personality. As homophobic name-calling constitutes a form of victimization, the authors suggest discouraging or eliminating this practice in educational settings. Ioverno et al. (2021) suggest that bullying against gender nonconforming or gender nonbinary individuals may stem from a defensive attempt to reinforce bullies' own gender norms. Accordingly, interventions involving bullies should be conducted professionally and with input from psychologists. The authors also highlight how male bullies, in particular, may select victims based on gender conformity, emphasizing the need to understand this dynamic to address issues of gender victimization. Additionally, victimization of adolescents, including those who identify as LGB, transgender, or heterosexual, can result in adverse outcomes such as anxiety, depression, and substance use disorders, especially among sexual and gender minority youth. This underscores the importance of preventative measures to address substance abuse in adolescents, recognizing that substance abuse can be a manifestation of underlying psychological issues.",
    "Rewritten passage:\n\nHomosexuality is a topic discussed in ancient religious texts such as the Old Testament Book of Leviticus and the writings of the Apostle Paul. Leviticus 18:22 states, \"Do not lie down with a man as with a woman: this is an abomination,\" while Romans 1:27 speaks of men who \"burn with lust for one another\" and engage in \"shameful deeds.\" It is important to note that the historical context of these scriptures refers to sexual acts rather than the modern concept of sexual orientation focused on loving relationships between same-sex partners.\n\nThroughout history and across different societies, homosexual relationships have existed, but the idea of sexual orientation as an inherent aspect of an individual is a relatively recent development. This understanding emerged towards the end of the 19th century, complicating direct comparisons between historical perspectives on homosexuality and contemporary beliefs within Christianity (Kuefler 1256).\n\nMoreover, ancient and medieval societies viewed homosexual relationships differently than modern society does. These relationships were not considered equal unions in the past. In Christian contexts, harsh punishments, including execution, were often prescribed for individuals engaging in same-sex relationships. The Inquisition targeted homosexuals, and the Code of Justinian in Byzantium imposed severe penalties such as castration and death. Religious beliefs often fueled these persecutions. The absence of recognition for equal unions between same-sex partners in historical contexts demonstrates a significant shift in societal attitudes and perceptions regarding homosexuality over time.",
    "The authors of the Constitution did not hold the belief that citizens would actively engage in the political affairs of the nation. While the Constitution enshrined various freedoms, its creators harbored doubts about the populace's interest in political matters. Although information was scarce in that era, contemporary mass media now assist in keeping individuals well-informed about political developments. Additionally, the media functions as a governmental oversight mechanism, scrutinizing the exercise of power (How Does the Media Affect Politics). News outlets report on events, allowing individuals to form opinions or express their perspectives (How Does the Media Affect Politics). However, it is prudent not to overly rely on the media and to endeavor to stay abreast of the country's political landscape. The framers perceived ordinary citizens as ill-informed and apathetic toward governmental affairs. I challenge the notion that citizens lack information or interest in political matters. Presently, numerous organizations advocate for civil liberties and closely monitor political events. Individuals do not wait for crises to voice their opinions; rather, they strive to remain well-informed about ongoing developments (Jach & Trolian, 2022). The media, serving as a vital information source, simplifies this endeavor by granting access to global news updates (Greenberg & Page, 2015). While crises may heighten political interest, many individuals consistently voice their opinions regardless of the prevailing political or economic circumstances. These individuals warrant considerable respect as they function as watchdogs over the expansive powers vested in our lawmakers and judges by the nation's enacted laws.",
    "Olivier Armantier and his team shook things up with their article, \"How Economic Crises Shake Up Inflation Beliefs: Insights from the Wild Ride of the COVID-19 Pandemic,\" which burst into the Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization on July 24, 2021. The publishing powerhouse Elsevier got in on the action, teaming up with the Copyright Center RightsLink service to serve up a smorgasbord of options for playing with this content. Elsevier opened the floodgates for access options, throwing in nifty identifiers, links, and citations to give this paper some serious pizazz.\n\nIn their electrifying paper, these mavericks zoomed in on the public economy's rollercoaster journey during the COVID-19 saga. They dove headfirst into the turbulent sea of inflation perceptions during the pandemic's first six months. While blazing their own trail, Armantier and the gang (2021) also synced up with other researchers, busily dissecting the economic rumbles of the COVID-19 downturn.\n\nA standout feature of their work is the authors' deep dive into the aftershocks of inflationary crises, cleverly comparing them to earlier disasters to suss out the crisis's full impact. This survey isn't just a walk in the park; it aims to wrangle with a broad spectrum of economic outcomes. After analyzing till they dropped, the authors uncovered a juicy find: inflation expectations were on a leash, suggesting that beneath the surface tranquility lies a vibrant fabric of diverse views, especially in the short term (Bekaert et al., 2020).\n\nA hefty chunk of households, especially the brainy ones, initially bet on low inflation or even deflation as the pandemic's outcomes. Armantier et al. (2021) nailed it on the head with a thorough analysis, backing up their findings with a dazzling array of graphs and tables in their article.\n\nI was hooked on Armantier and the crew's study (2021) because they dared to peer into crises triggered by offbeat factors and how households weather the storm. Their sharp-eye comparisons with past crises revealed how inflation assumptions could snowball into an avalanche of trouble across the economy (Armantier et al., 2021). Just like the Great Recession, a beastie fueled by a brutal demand hit from crashing house and stock prices.\n\nWhat really warmed my heart was how these authors didn't shy away from the grittiness of inflation beliefs and unearthed the striking contrasts among different groups. This paper isn't just a read—it's a front-row seat to a thrilling expedition in economic thought. Time to buckle up and delve into the twists and turns of the economic saga unveiled by Armantier and his crew! 🚀✨",
    "The widespread adoption of digital technology has significantly elevated the significance of email as a communication tool. Email has revolutionized communication by enabling individuals to easily connect with colleagues, family members, friends, business associates, and organizational representatives in real-time, transcending the constraints of traditional face-to-face interaction. An intriguing area of study pertains to the transformation of communication practices attributable to the advent of email.\n\nIn the realm of interpersonal communication, two pivotal effects merit attention. Firstly, email has significantly expanded the reach of communication, allowing interactions to seamlessly transition from physical encounters to online exchanges, thereby reshaping perceptions of interpersonal communication and streamlining connectivity. Secondly, email has impacted the interpretation of nonverbal cues such as emotions and body language, which may be inadequately conveyed in textual correspondence, particularly in professional contexts where the nuances of spoken language hold lesser significance. While emoji and stickers serve as alternatives, they are sparingly utilized in email communication compared to messaging platforms.\n\nA primary advantage underscored by email is its heightened accessibility, facilitating uninterrupted communication and sustained connections with individuals irrespective of time and location. Nevertheless, certain drawbacks accompany this convenience, including reliance on internet infrastructure, the necessity of electronic devices, and concerns regarding cybersecurity. Errors are common in electronic correspondence as individuals often transpose conventional communication norms to the digital sphere, leading to blunders such as disregarding the recipient's preferences, lapses in digital etiquette, inconsistent writing styles, and verbose, disorganized messages.\n\nTo mitigate such errors in everyday correspondence, it is prudent to acquaint oneself with electronic etiquette guidelines, meticulously review messages before dispatch, tailor language and style to suit specific recipients, and condense messages to succinct yet meaningful exchanges.",
    "Many American corporate executives prioritize financial growth over customer satisfaction and work engagement. Profitability is crucial for a company's success and operations. The speed of a company's growth is influenced by its financial resources and available product-market opportunities. A manager must consider factors like inflation, capital costs, profitability, and market value when determining the appropriate growth rate. It is essential for a company to exceed its cost of capital for positive growth impact or consider a strategy of controlled negative growth. To maintain growth, a company should aim to surpass the inflation rate and deliver a premium to investors. Failing to meet investor expectations and managing return on equity and cost of capital properly can harm a company's financial health.",
    "The chapter explores how global trade transformed cultures by enriching them with exotic art, ideas, and books. During this period, wealthy rulers and merchants displayed power through acquiring unique works of art, fostering cultural exchange, and promoting tolerance for diversity. The era of Enlightenment emerged as a triumph of human reason, enabling people to understand the laws of nature and human behavior. The chapter analyzes the contributions of different continents, highlighting significant events such as the formation of powerful groups in West and South Asia led by the Ottoman, Safavid, and Mughal dynasties. It also delves into the cultural developments of China, Japan, the Americas, slave states in Africa, and Australia. The interaction and mutual influence of diverse cultures played a pivotal role in their collective progress during the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries, marked by a global cultural renaissance. This period witnessed increased consumption of books and the creation of new monuments, symbolizing the growing wealth and prosperity brought on by international trade. The world became highly integrated through globalization, with some regions resisting change while others succumbed to European cultural influences.",
    "Summary:\nIn today's America, opioids reign supreme as the go-to drug of choice. Once hailed for their pain-relieving powers, these sneaky substances quickly became the life of the party - causing folks to get high on relaxation. With a euphoric rush like no other, it's no wonder opioid abuse is sky-high, turning addiction into a full-blown crisis. The nation is in the throes of one epic drug disaster, with prescription opioids leading the charge: heroin and fentanyl are the deadly duo fueling more than half of all drug-related deaths (Coon et al., 2022). As if things couldn't get worse, the COVID-19 pandemic has only given this crisis even more steam, putting a chokehold on the economy and endangering national security.\n\nForms of Treatment for Opioid Addiction:\nWhen it comes to kicking opioid addiction to the curb, the name of the game is \"substitution therapy.\" This crafty approach swaps out super-addictive drugs like heroin for a safer alternative, with methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone leading the charge (Volkow et al., 2014). Doctors handle these meds with kid gloves, steering clear of any unwanted side effects. Methadone, for instance, can unleash a beastly withdrawal syndrome if discontinued abruptly. In times of need, other tools like tranquilizers, antidepressants, and non-opioid painkillers can swoop in to save the day. Symptomatic treatment and good ol' supportive therapy are also key players in this life-or-death game. Holding a patient's hand through the brutal withdrawal phase, doctors keep a watchful eye on their every move.\n\nHelping a Loved One with Opioid Addiction:\nIn the fighting corner of opioid addiction, family and friends are the heavyweight champs. Motivation is the magic word, revving up the engine for a battle that could save a life. Rehab centers are like dream weavers, turning the messy nightmare of addiction into a fairytale ending where sobriety reigns supreme (Brown, 2018). With a tailored plan to kick the habit and reignite life's spark, these centers offer more than just a sober ticket - they restore the very essence of living. To fuel this fire, psychiatrists dive deep into the heart and soul of the addicted, enlisting family and friends to spill the beans on their every habit, love, and connection.",
    "Social responsibility involves the implementation of policies by organizations as part of their corporate governance framework to ensure that the company's operations are efficient and beneficial for all stakeholders. These guidelines aim to safeguard the environment, enhance societal well-being, and provide a conducive work environment by recognizing and valuing skilled and diligent employees. Consequently, this fosters customer loyalty as clients perceive their support for the business as contributing to worthwhile initiatives, thus attracting more financial resources and garnering additional investor support. The company acknowledges and motivates its employees through meaningful commendations, fostering a sense of appreciation. It affords workers the opportunity to lead by example while granting them autonomy in decision-making, underscoring trust and competence (Yang et al., 2019).\n\nFurther incentives such as annual or semi-annual bonuses, paid time off, and cash rewards serve to enhance performance and bolster morale. The company practices Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) by embracing an ethical business code that guides employee conduct with regard to ethics, standards, the environment, self-respect, and customer service. Moreover, the organization has established reliable safety systems to protect staff members and prevent accidents and injuries (Tamvada, 2020). It also ensures that suppliers are informed of and comply with responsible conduct expectations, including considerations such as reasonable pricing. This involves scrutinizing vendors to ascertain their past actions and communicating the company's requirements.\n\nA suggested enhancement to the CSR strategy pertains to fostering employees' creativity by encouraging brainstorming sessions to promote innovation and novel ideas (Tamvada, 2020). Despite some concerns regarding the company's engagement practices and expenditures, it is evident that efforts are being made to elevate CSR, generating more benefits as it progresses in this direction. Improved brand recognition, for example, leads to increased sales. Nestle, through its commitment to social responsibility and environmental sustainability, has emerged as a model corporate citizen due to its remarkable accomplishments in uplifting communities. This includes raising living standards, providing access to clean water and sanitation, and promoting healthy lifestyles among populations.\n\nTo further enhance risk management practices, I recommend the implementation of an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework (Tamvada, 2020). ERM is specifically designed to identify potential events that could impact the business, thus aiding in both risk mitigation and opportunity optimization while ensuring alignment with company objectives.",

    "In his book \"Mexicans in the Making of America,\" Neil Foley discusses the impact of Mexican Americans on U.S. history. He emphasizes how negative stereotypes and discrimination towards Mexican immigrants and citizens were created by the American government, despite the historical context showing that white settlers were the illegal invaders in Texas in the 1830s. The discriminatory treatment stemmed from the 1846-1848 war and subsequent treaty, which led to unfair annexation of Texas and denial of rights to Mexican people living there. The chapter reveals the biased viewpoints held in the U.S. about Mexico and highlights the erased memory of the Aztec Empire, early abolition of slavery in Mexico, and the unjust war waged by the U.S. against a weaker neighbor. The aftermath of the war introduced new laws allowing people to choose between returning to Mexico or becoming U.S. citizens with equal rights only on paper. Most chose to identify as Spanish Americans to evade negativity associated with Mexican descent. The book concludes that this historical event not only created a physical border but also fostered misunderstandings in the relationship between the two nations. Overall, Foley's work delves into the origins of Mexican Americans, particularly examining how the Texas annexation shaped the future political dynamics between Mexico and the U.S., ultimately damaging their relations and affecting the perception of Mexican immigrants and citizens.",

    "The airline industry has been severely affected by Covid-19. Travel restrictions imposed by governments have hurt the revenue and operations of airline companies. Passengers were reluctant to travel due to testing rules and limited resources. These restrictions were put in place to reduce Covid-19 cases. The decrease in demand led to a significant loss in revenue for airlines. Many flights were canceled, and employees were laid off. The industry faced economic challenges as a result. The number of available seats and passengers decreased drastically. Cargo flights, on the other hand, remained stable or even increased due to the transportation of medical supplies. With the availability of vaccines and reduced restrictions, the situation began to improve in 2021. The revenue loss in 2021 was lower compared to 2020. Despite the challenges, there is hope for better days ahead as the industry gradually recovers.",
    "The researchers' conclusions are based on three incredibly well-designed case studies exploring different software applications with groundbreaking potential! These studies delve into evaluating bone fractures from traffic accidents, bone injuries from a spade, and gunshot wounds to the head, providing invaluable insights into advancing modern forensic investigations (Buck et al., 2008). The modeling software and haptic device used in the research are nothing short of exceptional, boasting precise results, minimal friction, outstanding fidelity, and an impressive six degrees of freedom output capacity. In today's world, these specs are truly top-notch!\n\nHowever, replicating the study to validate the findings may pose a challenge due to the high cost of assembling all the necessary specimens and equipment as emphasized by Pinzon et al. (2016). The researchers have done an outstanding job drawing interpretations and conclusions from the rich data obtained from the three distinct case studies mentioned earlier. These studies reveal that haptic devices can be incredibly beneficial in post-mortem and forensic investigations, revolutionizing the field.\n\nInnovative research like this can play a pivotal role in allowing investigators to reconstruct crime scenes, pinpoint important details such as gun-holding positions, and identify objects used in crimes with unprecedented precision and speed. Hagmann et al. (2021) rightly point out that leveraging haptics in forensic science can streamline the criminal justice process, making investigations more robust and reliable. The integration of technology to recreate crime scenes and restore the sense of touch in virtual environments is groundbreaking and enhances current technologies significantly. The ability for users to interact with and feel 3D digital information is a monumental leap forward.\n\nWhile there may be concerns regarding the use of haptics, such as potential system corruption and hacking risks to manipulate findings, these innovations have the power to transform criminal justice proceedings. Fahrni et al. (2019) raise considerations around the increased costs associated with using such cutting-edge technology and training personnel, potentially creating barriers to justice, particularly in lower-income areas. Nonetheless, the impact of this innovation is undeniable, and the researchers deserve praise for drawing concrete conclusions from their meticulous case studies.",
    "The emergence of slavery in the American territories was influenced by a multitude of factors between the years 1526 and 1776. Historians have proposed various explanations for the evolution of the slave trade during this period, with a strong connection being identified between slavery and the labor demands within European colonies. Slavery was particularly prevalent in the labor-intensive sugar plantations in regions such as the Caribbean and South America, which were under the control of Great Britain, Spain, France, and the Dutch Republic. Captives from Africa were transported on slave ships to the West, while indigenous peoples in North American colonies were also enslaved to a lesser extent. However, Indian slavery came to a halt by the late eighteenth century.\n\nThe treatment of slavery varied across different colonial territories of British North America. Enslaved individuals were utilized in various industries including breweries, shipyards, plantations, and timber yards. In the northern regions, slavery gradually transitioned towards free labor, leading to a decline in the slave population during the 1760s and 1770s. Antislavery activism was prevalent in cities like Philadelphia, where nationalist pamphleteers distributed antislavery booklets among both black and white populations. The presence of antislavery groups facilitated manumissions, leading to a decrease in the viability of slavery in the North. New York had a significant slave population who acquired valuable trades, but all slaves were eventually freed in 1827, despite the sentiments of liberation during the Revolutionary War.\n\nDistinguishing between indentured servants and slaves, indentured service differed from enslavement as it involved a type of debt servitude where individuals agreed to a period of unpaid labor to cover their immigration costs to America. Indentured workers were provided with basic necessities such as housing, clothing, and food but did not receive wages. In contrast, slaves were considered property and rarely granted freedom despite years of arduous labor. They could be bought, sold, exchanged, and even bequeathed as property through a will.",
    "The concept of tribal sovereignty has been closely examined over time, with tribes facing a spectrum of treatment from encouragement and efforts of inclusion within the broader community to harsh persecution. Within this context, the legislation surrounding tribal gaming can be viewed as a positive stride towards acknowledging the distinctive lifestyles and self-determination of tribes. This piece explores the query on how the tribal gaming act can strengthen tribal sovereignty.\n\nBy enacting the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, tribes were granted the authority to choose which gaming activities they wished to partake in, with state approval being generally required. These activities could encompass traditional tribal games or games of chance, depending on tribal preferences and state consent. Given the uniqueness and cultural significance of tribal games, it is justifiable to affirm that allowing tribes to conduct their own games is vital. This provision works to preserve their heritage and affirm control over an essential aspect of life – recreation.\n\nFurthermore, gaming contributes to the continuity of traditions and practices by perpetuating rituals that have evolved over generations. In terms of sovereignty, gaming helps delineate the domains of life that fall entirely within the jurisdiction of tribes. For instance, while some tribe members integrate with the broader society by seeking employment or assimilating into urban lifestyles, gaming—especially traditional tribal gaming—acts as a touchstone to ancestral origins. It champions freedom of choice and sovereignty, as it is an area largely governed by tribes themselves.",
    "Individual freedoms should never be compromised in the name of national security. Contrary to authoritarian regimes, democratic systems prioritize individual rights over national security interests. Upholding individual freedoms is a fundamental principle and goal of democracy as it protects the rights enshrined in the US Constitution. Rather than sacrificing freedoms, national security should aim to safeguard the interests of every citizen, recognizing that each individual is vital to the nation. In democratic societies, the sanctity of individual freedoms is non-negotiable and essential for maintaining the integrity of the state.",

Rihanna's distinct vocals, influenced by Sia's demo, captivated listeners with its positive and hopeful message centered around love and resilience symbolized by diamonds. The track's infectious melody and inspiring lyrics garnered widespread recognition and numerous awards, propelling Rihanna's career to new heights.",
    "Various circumstances under which medical staff have worked have led to the development of different types of leadership strategies. For instance, the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of clear communication and prompt preparation in top healthcare leaders (Nicola et al., 2020). Another key tactic involves the use of external change agents that can enhance organizational decision-making (Alagoz et al., 2018). Additionally, research has shown that adopting positivity and open-mindedness as leaders can boost employees' resilience and motivation (Wei et al., 2018).\n\nTherefore, it is crucial for effective healthcare leaders to adapt to external changes and communicate strategically with their colleagues. Healthcare administrators play a vital role in interacting with various departments, such as the in-patient department that requires a multidisciplinary approach from skilled professionals. Critical care and A&E departments also need strong management and collaboration opportunities to ensure optimal patient care.\n\nBy taking a holistic approach that considers both external and internal factors, healthcare leaders can enhance patient outcomes and achieve desired results. Collective decision-making should be viewed as an asset rather than a limitation in healthcare management. Interprofessional collaboration in medical institutions has been proven to positively impact patient outcomes, demonstrating the importance of sharing knowledge and seeking advice from colleagues. It is essential to continue working on improving this strategy to enhance the range of services professionals can offer to their patients.",
    "The Net Present Value (NPV) is a crucial measure that demonstrates the anticipated cash flows an investor or funder will receive from a project after accounting for various expenses. It provides insight into the total profit an investor can expect once the project starts generating returns, helping to assess the project's viability based on potential risks and costs. NPV boasts numerous advantages compared to other investment criteria, rooted in common sense and rationality pertaining to investment decisions and return criteria. By incorporating a time perspective, NPV surpasses static measures in profitability evaluation. Moreover, NPV's first notable advantage lies in its association with expected value, signaling a decrease in value at the time of investment. In contrast to the payback period, NPV acknowledges the transient nature of currency value and incorporates this nuance into discount rate calculations. By factoring in assumptions about capital costs, NPV aids in strategic decision-making regarding project profitability. Furthermore, the flexibility and additive nature of NPV as a criterion allow for a comprehensive evaluation of various projects or a single project. Additionally, NPV's consideration of investment size establishes it as a unidimensional criterion enabling the estimation of wealth creation likelihood based on cash flow volume. Therefore, NPV stands out among other investment criteria due to its focus on present money value, flexibility, additivity, and the comprehensive evaluation of various investments.",
    "Properly managing business outputs requires a thorough examination of the external environment of the industry. 7-Eleven could benefit significantly from implementing the I/O Model of Above-Average Returns, which involves analyzing the firm's external conditions. The first step is to assess the industry and competitor environment to gain a clear understanding of the overall atmosphere. In the case of 7-Eleven, competitors include large-scale convenience stores like Walmart and Target. The industry's attractiveness is another important aspect to consider, as it should offer high potential for generating above-average returns, which is currently favorable in the convenience store segment due to increasing demand for large-scale product distribution shops. Next, selecting a strategy is crucial to ensure above-average returns, such as establishing multiple branches internationally. However, this requires specific assets and skills, including necessary products and resources, understanding of the economic environment in the target countries, and expertise in international trade and branch management. To implement the chosen strategy successfully, leveraging the company's strengths like existing international branches and a successful operational history in the US would be beneficial. By integrating global expansion into its goals, 7-Eleven can effectively execute the strategy and achieve above-average returns.",
    "The suggested strategies to deal with the effects of coronavirus, like the ones used in Iceland, are quite interesting. While Iceland's approach recognizes its limitations based on the unique characteristics of its community and geography, it may not work as effectively in NATO countries with high numbers of infected individuals. It's important to have a rapid response and extensive testing to combat the increasing infections. However, it's crucial that the population is onboard with these measures. Despite financial support, some NATO countries may struggle to afford the necessary testing, especially if new waves of infection hit multiple countries at once. Considering the Israeli approach of digital contact tracing, this method could be more practical for NATO countries as it doesn't require strict border controls. It might be a helpful way to respond promptly to new outbreaks, but implementing it would require significant funding for infrastructure upgrades.",
    "The Canadian perspective on the North Atlantic Council's agenda covers important issues related to Canadian security, including enhanced participation in global peace operations and maintaining strong relationships with NATO allies. Of particular note is the smart defense approach, which considers both military and economic needs. Assessing the impact of the Syrian threat on Canadian interests amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic is challenging. Therefore, a reevaluation of strategies is crucial for defending Canadian interests effectively. This approach benefits both Israel and Canada, strengthening their relationship. Canada's willingness to cooperate in the withdrawal of troops from Iraq upon official request enhances its reputation for humanitarianism internationally. Emphasizing trade relationships and close ties with NATO allies is crucial for Israel, given its history of security threats. Although Israel lacked a formal national security strategy until 1953, it has since bolstered security through political and military alliances and active trade agreements with key countries, contributing to its current regional power and prosperity.",
    "Nike's current issue arises from a corrupt corporate culture that disadvantaged women. Powerful men in charge have mistreated and silenced women, preventing them from advancing without harassment or disrespect. Four ways to address this issue are absolving, solving, resolving, and dissolving. To ensure long-term progress, the best solution would be to dissolve Nike, targeting the root causes of the problem. Absolving means ignoring the problem, solving entails compensating affected women without addressing the culture, and resolving involves empowering women without changing the toxic environment. However, just empowering women is insufficient; Nike must create an environment where mistreatment is not tolerated. Transforming Nike's culture should occur at all levels to prevent misconduct from permeating throughout the organization. Hence, Nike's leadership, including Parker, needs to implement measures to discourage misconduct and address its underlying causes. The recommended plan is to thoroughly evaluate each employee and manager for involvement in past transgressions at Nike. Those found complicit, including Parker and the board, should be removed. The new leadership must establish a culture emphasizing equality, competence, and diversity.",
    "The economic gap in the US has affected job losses even before COVID-19, which has only made things worse. During the pandemic, those with higher education kept their jobs by working from home, while others lost jobs without a safety net. Race and education greatly impact job availability. Black Americans face discrimination in job searches, housing, and daily life, leading to unequal job opportunities. While overall unemployment rates have dropped post-pandemic, the rate for black individuals remains higher. Education, job stability, and support networks play a role in this disparity.",
    "Prominent musicians have left an indelible mark on the soul music genre, with James Brown shining brightly among them. As the popularity of Southern soul skyrocketed in the late 1960s, Brown had already begun making waves back in 1956 (Covach and Flory 218). Originating as a stand-in for Little Richard, his debut record \"Please Please Please\" proved to be a roaring success (Covach and Flory 240-241). Brown initially showcased a musical style reminiscent of the 1950s doo-wop era, with his early songs featuring his lead vocals (Covach and Flory 242).\n\nHowever, the tide began to turn in 1960 with \"Think,\" where Brown introduced a soulful blend of horns and a pulsating rhythm section, truly setting the stage for his distinctive sound (Covach and Flory 242). The year 1964 saw Brown unleash \"Out of Sight,\" embodying the dynamic and hard-driving soul style that would come to define his later career in the 1970s (Covach and Flory 242). James Brown epitomized the essence of an artist taking charge of their music, fusing an assertive vocal and dance performance style with production expertise and a keen business acumen (Covach and Flory 242).\n\nMoving away from the prevailing themes of past eras, Brown embarked on a journey towards crafting truly unique sounds that set him apart from his contemporaries at Motown, Stax, and Atlantic records, resulting in a repertoire of unmistakable tunes (Covach and Flory 243). Notable distinctions in his music, such as the impactful stops at the end of verses in \"Papa's Got a Brand New Bag, Pt. 1,\" set him apart from the typical Stax arrangements, while the lack of background vocals deviated from Motown's signature approach (Covach and Flory 243).\n\nJames Brown's influence transcended the boundaries of mainstream music, resonating deeply within the Black community through his boldly expressed racial pride, hard-hitting musical style, and politically charged lyrics (Covach and Flory 244). A commanding figure both on and off the stage, Brown poured his heart and soul into his live performances, showcasing his prowess as a singer, dancer, and bandleader, all while meticulously rehearsing his ensemble of talented musicians (Covach and Flory 240). Undoubtedly, James Brown stands out as a visionary performer with a musical and societal vision that set him apart from his peers in the industry.",

    "John Smeaton, the eminent English engineer responsible for the design of bridges, canals, and lighthouses, is the focus of an insightful article penned by Andrew M. A. Morris. The author illuminates how Smeaton applied parameter variation in a significantly expanded scope as a pivotal aspect of an analytical method (Morris, 2021). Morris emphatically conveys the three primary objectives of this approach: optimization, theory validation, and the refinement of maxims through exploratory analysis. Morris asserts that the core essence of this research lies in Smeaton's achievement of transcending mere process improvement in engineering by systematizing preceding artisanal practices, thereby challenging the established perception of Smeaton's methodology prevalent among technology analysts in the 1990s (Morris, 2021). Furthermore, according to Morris, Smeaton's methodology forms a bridge between science and technology by integrating both theoretical validation and practical experimentation (Morris, 2021).\n\nI share the author's viewpoint and am convinced that John Smeaton adeptly engaged in customary hypothesis testing while advancing empirical regularities through exploratory trials. Despite the assertions of some scholars claiming a lack of scientific inquiry in Smeaton's endeavors, the engineer meticulously analyzed his work and derived his own guiding principles. Morris delves into the linkage connecting science and technology during the era of the Industrial Revolution. Expounding on outdated historical analyses by A.E. Musson, Eric Robinson, and A. Rupert Hall, Morris postulates that traditional perspectives have overlooked the crucial role of science in the industrial epoch (Morris, 2021). Contrary to Hall's skepticism regarding the contributions of technical innovations to scientific progress during the 18th century, I assert that the Industrial Revolution was a harmonious amalgamation of technology, science, and industry. Pioneering advancements and technological progressions not only revolutionized existing domains of human existence but also birthed entirely novel sectors. The transition from harnessing natural energy sources like wind and water to the exploration and optimization of steam power by John Smeaton played a pivotal role in propelling the Industrial Revolution forward and facilitating its unprecedented growth.",
    "The state of Washington boasts one of the lowest rates of uninsured individuals, standing at 6.6% as of 2019, a significant contrast to states like Oklahoma (14.9%) and Texas (18.4%) (Kaiser Family Foundation, n.d.). This discrepancy underscores the undeniable link between socioeconomic status and healthcare access. Limited financial means often result in inadequate access to quality healthcare, with low-income individuals frequently lacking insurance or eligibility for Medicaid. Consequently, these individuals tend to underutilize necessary healthcare services, often resorting to emergency care only and neglecting preventive and other essential treatments. The low uninsured percentage in Washington is largely attributed to its plentiful job opportunities, enabling residents to afford health insurance. Furthermore, residents are well-informed about their healthcare options, and the state boasts a higher concentration of healthcare facilities compared to rural areas, contributing to the high rate of insured individuals.\n\nIn addition to socioeconomic factors, disparities in access to healthcare are also influenced by ethnic disparities, educational access, and community environments. Washington's inclusive environment allows individuals from diverse backgrounds to integrate and access support more easily. Conversely, in certain parts of the country, ethnic minorities may face prejudice, hindering their access to quality education and well-paying jobs.",
    "Kantian ethics shines as the prime example of non-consequential theories in philosophy, resonating throughout the realm of law as well. Enthusiasts of imperative social order concepts like utilitarianism rally behind this theory! For Kant, non-consequential ethics find a powerful advocate in the form of the categorical imperative - a beacon guiding individuals towards truly moral actions (Kant & Abbott, 2021). This imperative speaks directly to the individual, urging them to adhere to moral choices based on rational principles with utmost urgency and precision. Kant's pure practical reason principles take a definite non-consequential form, laying out a framework for moral behavior that transcends individual interests (Kant & Abbott, 2021).\n\nIn Kant's view, morality must be absolute and universal; any form of relativism threatens its very essence (Kant & Abbott, 2021). By juxtaposing the universal moral law with the intricacies of individual actions in specific circumstances, Kant reveals the core of non-consequential ethics. Here lies the tension between the unwavering universal moral law and the complexities of real-life decisions – a conflict central to Kant's ethical stance. Individuals may be tempted to disregard universal morality in favor of personal circumstances, undermining the categorical imperative. It is crucial to delve deeper into Kant's ethical framework to understand this complex interplay.",
    "Labor racketeering involves the unlawful manipulation of unions and authority for personal gain. The collaboration with criminal organizations and corruption within labor unions became a major concern in the early 20th century (Jacobs, 2020). Up until the late 1970s and early 1980s, there was a lack of systematic government intervention to address this issue (Jacobs, 2020). Organized crime groups capitalized on the prohibition era by profiting from illegal alcohol sales, and even after its repeal in the 1930s, they continued to thrive by diversifying into various illegal enterprises such as narcotics, gambling, and prostitution (Jacobs, 2020).\n\nOne significant aspect that boosted the profits of organized crime was labor racketeering through their control over labor unions. Gangs, like the Cosa Nostra, targeted unions such as the Teamsters and the International Longshoremen’s Association for their widespread legitimate business connections, which provided avenues for money laundering and covering up illicit activities (Jacobs, 2020).\n\nIn addition to running illicit operations, organized crime groups engaged in extortion, bribery, and intimidation of employers to expand their influence and control over local businesses. The use of labor unions as a front for their criminal enterprises allowed them not only to traffic illegal goods and services but also to gain easy access to healthcare and pension funds (Jacobs, 2020). Thus, it is apparent that organized crime has historically sought to dominate and grow its influence through the diversification of profits, with labor racketeering being one of its key activities in conjunction with other criminal enterprises.",
    "Language studies encompass a variety of scientific approaches, each offering unique insights into the way we communicate. One intriguing method is the prescriptive approach, which outlines rules for speaking and writing. According to Crystal (1987), prescriptivism sets a standard interpretation of language, predominantly seen in formal speech and literature. In contrast, the descriptive approach focuses on observing linguistic diversity without imposing standards. Crystal (1987) suggests that adopting either method exclusively can lead to unrealistic depictions and biases. Embracing both approaches harmoniously can yield a balanced view, combining societal order with natural language evolution. Despite concerns about language change being associated with deterioration and societal issues, Crystal (1987) provides compelling arguments against these fears. While resistance to change is common, language evolution is an organic process shaped by society and its progressive members, distinct from changes in education and media influence. Ultimately, accepting language evolution as a natural phenomenon can help us appreciate the richness and dynamism of communication.",
    "Global management changes have impacted leadership processes significantly. The technological revolution allows businesses to operate globally, creating opportunities and challenges for leaders. Successful leaders must have a global mindset and embrace cross-cultural transformational leadership to navigate the competitive landscape effectively. Cultural differences affect leadership behavior, emphasizing the need for leaders with strong cultural management skills. Aim for global leadership to succeed in today's competitive environment.",
    "Goals are broad and long-term outcomes, while objectives are measurable, specific, and short-term strategies to achieve those goals (Nickels et al., 2019). In the criminal justice system, goals guide actions such as deterrence, rehabilitation, retribution, restoration, and incapacitation to address criminal behavior and protect people's rights. Leadership and management play vital roles in ensuring an agency's survival in a changing and complex environment, with leaders providing vision and managers implementing processes to pursue goals and objectives effectively (Nickels et al., 2019). Leaders take risks and drive transformation, while managers optimize processes to achieve reliable outcomes. Earning a degree in criminal justice is crucial for achieving long-term career goals and enhancing leadership abilities. Adapting to change and developing strong analytical and relational skills are key objectives to influence positive change in the criminal justice system.",
    "The video resonated with me when Isaiah shared that Samuel had shown him that even sitting down, one person could play t-ball and hit it hard. This highlighted how bias can exist, even with good intentions. Samuel's family had not understood the challenges faced by disabled individuals until he was born. The scene of the child hitting the t-ball underscored the importance of treating disabled people equally, providing them with opportunities to showcase their abilities. I found it inspiring to see kids like Nathanial Orellana thriving in a regular classroom. His mother actively sought the best education for him due to his autism, emphasizing the extra challenges parents of disabled children face. The video emphasized the need for communities and the government to offer diverse schooling options for children with disabilities. While these children require special care, they should also have the chance to interact with others for their development, as engagement plays a pivotal role in learning. Nathanial's eagerness to participate in class discussions highlighted how engagement fosters achievement. The video shed light on the experiences of individuals with disabilities, illustrating the hurdles parents often encounter while seeking quality education for their children. Emily, who has schizophrenia, stressed the importance of understanding the struggles faced by those with mental illness. Keith Jones emphasized the need for ample social interaction for children's proper development, advocating for inclusivity despite differences.",
    "The article's thesis is supported by other authors who examined Professor Wilson's unusual shift in lifestyle. His decision to live in a dumpster for sustainability reasons is complex and involves maximizing space. He shares his experiences with his ecology-focused students who stay with him at night. The concept of a respected scholar living in a dumpster reminded me of Diogenes, an Ancient Greek philosopher who lived in a barrel. The personal details of the divorced professor added a psychological aspect to the story, prompting me to ponder if his divorce prompted this drastic change. Viewing the visuals of the dumpster and everyday activities helped break the monotony of reading, sparking some questions and personal interest in the topic. Despite the dumpster's comfortable interior, the lack of home amenities like a kitchen and bathroom makes it unsuitable for permanent living in my opinion.",
    "Both lookism and extreme body modification are connected to the unhealthy and unrealistic beauty standards prevalent in modern society. Despite this common trait, these two phenomena differ significantly in how they manifest and their direct consequences.\n\nLookism involves judging individuals based on their appearance, particularly if they do not meet conventional beauty norms. It focuses on criticizing those who don't fit societal standards and is therefore an external judgment applied by others.\n\nOn the other hand, extreme body modification involves altering one's physical appearance to diverge from society's established norms. This intentional transformation can be seen as a deviation from the accepted standards of appearance.\n\nWhile both stem from dissatisfaction with one's appearance, the key distinction lies in their external or internal focus. Those who engage in lookism often harbor deep insecurities about their own beauty, leading to judgmental behavior towards others. This preoccupation with critiquing others' appearances suggests an unhealthy self-image, though it may be less overt than extreme body modifications.\n\nIn contrast, extreme body modifications can be either a personal choice or a response to social pressure or custom. An example of the latter is the ancient Chinese practice of binding women's feet to achieve a small and rose-like shape. These expectations are frequently placed on women in various cultures, reflecting societal norms and ideals of beauty, respectability, and marital value.",
    "Machiavelli's \"The Prince\" challenges traditional political thought by focusing on practical politics with real people and situations rather than idealization. It advocates for rulers to use cunning and ruthless tactics for survival and retention of power, giving rise to the term \"Machiavellian.\" The book asserts that self-interest and the successful retention of power are crucial in politics, diverging from the traditional view of serving the people's interests.",
    "Various strata and dimensions pave the way for the manifestation of cultural levels. Edgar Shein’s intricate exploration of organizational culture levels, later expanded upon by Edward Granter, delineates four tiers of cultural elucidation in an entity: super-structural, symbolic, discursive, and cognitive (Granter, 2019). Essentially, the nuances of enterprise culture are an amalgamation of external economic and social stimuli, embodied through quintessential elements like logos, ceremonial traditions, values starkly articulated by the organization, and latent presumptions. \n\nThis discourse aims to evaluate the organizational ethos of Macomb Community College. Exemplified through the artifacts present within Macomb Community College, there is a palpable endorsement of concentration, attentiveness, and accountability, subtly echoed in its logo. A cursory examination of the architectural facets, notably those adorned with chic chrome-plated modern structures, hints at a pivot towards a curriculum emphasizing technology and scientific disciplines. However, the venerable central edifice and the verdant park lend an ambiance connoting tranquility and meditative contemplation, aligning more amiably with pursuits in fine arts and social sciences. \n\nNoteworthy is the college's pervasive culture of altruism and mutual esteem, evidently manifest in its conscientiously designed bus network catering to students. Delving into the value stratum, the plethora of signs within the college premises, be it parking indicators or library guides, underscore an affinity for precision and systematic arrangement. Presumably, the faculty in this institution commends students’ poise and dedication. \n\nAt the level of assumptions, one may infer the college's predisposition against admitting individuals exhibiting excessive self-expression or whose identity seems entrenched in superficial mainstream culture. The unassuming college website, bereft of ostentatious announcements or ventures enticing frivolous community involvement such as cookie sales or leisurely excursions, hints at a more sober approach. \n\nIn essence, Macomb Community College's organizational culture stands scrutinized. It boasts a definitive identity evident through its artifacts and values. However, a deeper probing into the foundational assumptions beckons pertinent reflections. Perhaps, the institution undervalues the essence of openness in interpersonal relationships and exhibits an uncompromising stance towards superficial identity markers or snap judgments. Given the pronounced allegiance to social and communal values, members of Macomb Community College are urged to contemplate the significance of openness in fostering robust social affiliations.",
    "The Epic of Gilgamesh is considered one of the earliest mythological texts, dating back over four thousand years. The story revolves around King Uruk's journey from a harsh ruler to a compassionate leader, as he grapples with mortality and learns the value of human connections. King Uruk, who was described as two-thirds divine and one-third human, is a pivotal character in the narrative. When the gods send Enkidu to humble Gilgamesh, the king learns the importance of friendship and social bonds. Despite seeking immortality, Gilgamesh comes to understand that death is inevitable for humans, as the gods reserved eternal life for themselves. In a bittersweet conclusion, Gilgamesh loses his chance at immortality but gains wisdom and appreciation for his city and his past. The enduring message of the story is that while mortality is a fact of human existence, the impact of one's deeds and relationships can outlast one's life.",
    "Motivation plays a crucial role in guiding individuals towards achieving their goals, with management responsible for monitoring and directing workers in a company (Usmonovich, 2021). It is essential for inducing individuals to work freely and effectively. Managers have valid reasons to be concerned about employee motivation, as success in a company is linked to talent and inspiration, and motivation can accelerate performance (Usmonovich, 2021). Lack of motivation can lead to lower output and organizational challenges, highlighting the significance of ensuring a motivated workforce. Understanding human nature and implementing effective motivational strategies are key to achieving organizational success and maintaining high levels of productivity (Usmonovich, 2021). Managers play a critical role in sustaining employees' engagement and morale to ensure the organization's goals are met by harnessing their unique traits and perspectives to motivate them effectively.",
    "This tote is ideal for busy mothers with teenage children who always need to be on the move yet want to maintain a stylish look while running errands and engaging in family activities. It is both high-end and durable, ensuring the owner's personal items are well-organized in a portable and secure manner, making it easier to head outdoors quickly. Based on survey data indicating that the top brands among the target audience are Chanel, Pucci, and Kate Spade, customers are torn between products that offer quality matching the price and luxury items with exorbitant prices. To justify the high-end cost, incorporating high-quality leather material and additional pockets for organized storage in the bag would be beneficial, as most luxury bags lack this feature. Since survey participants mostly prefer shoulder bags or totes, adding an extra shoulder strap would strengthen the case for pricing. Furthermore, the majority of respondents own three to five bags and prefer one versatile bag suitable for all occasions, including everyday use. Therefore, the conclusion is to offer a black leather bag measuring 9×11 at a production cost of $36. In terms of pricing, the target audience can afford bags ranging from $300 to $700 and prefers online shopping for handbags. Considering this income range, a mid-range priced bag would likely be more popular, as its cost can be justified compared to luxury bags. The closest mid-range alternative found in the research is the Ralph Lauren Carlyle Mini Leather Zip Tote Bag priced at $195. Setting the price for the future product around $250 is considered fair for the customers given the quality of the product. This price point will also generate additional revenue that Buhi can utilize for extra accessories and product packaging to enhance the luxurious feel of the product.",
    "Marx's powerful analysis of the fetishism of commodities reveals society's troubling tendency to assign value to goods based on the labor input, resulting in the domination of products over people. This phenomenon shapes social interactions between consumers and producers, as objects are exchanged independently of human needs or rational decisions (Ritzer, 2011). It is important to clarify that the term \"fetishism\" in this context does not refer to anything sexual but rather to the captivating allure that people exhibit towards these principles.\n\nIn today's world, we witness a similar fetishization of technological trends reminiscent of Marx's thesis. For instance, Apple products are revered for their perceived high quality and accessibility, despite ethical concerns surrounding their production processes. The brand benefits from the labor of countless individuals who work tirelessly to create these goods, thus enhancing their perceived value beyond their intrinsic worth. The public's perception and marketing strategies, rather than inherent quality, play a pivotal role in determining the value of these products.\n\nFurthermore, as highlighted in the Communist Manifesto (Marx & Engels, 1848), workers themselves become commodified in the pursuit of a brand's success, perpetuating a cycle of disconnection from reality. While Marx's thesis touches on the labor theory of value, it overlooks other dimensions influencing a commodity's worth, thus limiting its scope for addressing materialistic values in society. The nature of why certain commodities hold more value than others is left unexplored. Nevertheless, both the Communist Manifesto and Marx's thesis offer a robust framework for dissecting contemporary socio-economic relations.",

Historically, nursing education primarily focused on granting Bachelor’s degrees which provided foundational skills necessary for the profession. Nowadays, prospective nurses have the opportunity to enroll in high-caliber Master’s programs that enrich their capabilities. Consequently, one might question the true worth of pursuing such advanced degrees. Indeed, Master’s programs in nursing play a crucial role in healthcare by aligning with the rising significance of nurses and the contemporary healthcare landscape.\n\nWhile Bachelor’s degrees equip students with essential knowledge, core principles, and practical skills to become competent nurses, they do not offer a complete picture of the ever-evolving nursing profession. Conversely, Master’s programs act as a catalyst for individuals seeking to delve deeper into the complex principles of 21st-century nursing. These advanced degrees aim to cultivate nurses' critical thinking abilities, enhancing their cognitive flexibility to navigate challenging scenarios and enabling them to exercise strong leadership while recognizing the broader societal implications within healthcare decision-making processes (Bryant-Moore et al., 2018).\n\nMoreover, a Master’s degree curriculum in nursing nurtures emotional intelligence, a vital component for delivering patient-centered care. By honing their critical thinking skills, nurses learn to evaluate cases objectively and master the emotional aspect to establish meaningful connections with patients (Cassano et al., 2020). In addition, a Master’s in nursing advances expertise in scientific research, empowering nurses to contribute to the continual improvement of the healthcare system.\n\nIn essence, Master’s programs supplement the core competencies of nursing professionals with heightened cognitive, emotional, and research capabilities. As a result, they foster the emergence of nursing leaders poised to drive positive change within the profession.",
    "Mearsheimer explores the driving factors behind conflicts in Modern Europe as intertwined with the dynamics of power poles, influencing states' decisions to go to war. In his analysis, the existence of unevenly distributed authorities in the multipolar system fosters rivalry, leading to a state of perpetual instability with shifting relations among nations. These fluctuations, marked by shifts from hostility to camaraderie and back, fuel the recurring cycles of warfare by blurring assessments of adversaries' capabilities and intentions.\n\nHe distinguishes an imbalanced multipolarity as particularly precarious, with a dominant hegemon keen on amassing power triggering apprehension among other states, potentially provoking aggressive behaviors. In contrast, Mearsheimer observes that wars were less prevalent under a bipolar order in modern European history due to the mutual balance and understanding among countries. However, the applicability of this historical model to modern times becomes disputable, given the complexities of defining the current global order, which predominantly exhibits a multipolar nature steering global affairs.\n\nWhile multipolarity dictates contemporary international dynamics, the underlying presence of bipolar tendencies indicates a novel system shaped by diverse paradigms and repercussions. This nuanced interconnectedness which sets apart the current global landscape from its predecessors underscores the multifaceted nature behind the causations of military conflicts, evoking contemplation on Mearsheimer's insightful yet contentious propositions.\n\nMearsheimer's assertions on the origins of wars resonate with logic and coherence, although uncertainties arise concerning their validation in the context of nuclear armaments, a potent force not present in the multipolar world but significantly influencing the geopolitical landscape. Notably, he contends that the absence of warfare in bipolar Europe post-1945 was primarily dictated by the specter of nuclear destruction rather than power equilibriums, challenging conventional notions of power balances as the primary deterrence to armed conflicts in a nuclear age.",
    "Melanoma is a cancer that is often caught early but has been challenging to treat in the past. Thanks to advancements in melanoma treatment, particularly the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors, there is now hope for improved outcomes. These treatments have significantly prolonged survival for patients with metastatic melanoma and have allowed some to remain in remission without ongoing therapy. This progress also applies to patients in earlier stages of melanoma, like those in stages II and III, who can now experience long periods of remission. Adjuvant therapies, such as checkpoint inhibitors and combination treatments, play a crucial role in maintaining remission and preventing disease progression. While adjuvant therapy was once considered marginally effective, it is now recognized as an essential component of melanoma treatment. The case of Mr. B highlights how adjuvant therapy could potentially have prevented his melanoma from advancing to a more severe stage.",
    "Although mentoring is a relatively new term in church circles, it has long been practiced in Christian communities through spiritual coaching, discipleship, and friendship. Mallison (1998) defines Christian mentoring as an intentional relationship of trust where one person empowers another to maximize God's grace in their life and service. The core theme is that mentorship is essential for Christian growth, emphasizing community, and interdependence. Mallison highlights the importance of genuine interest in mentees' spiritual advancement. Structured Christian mentorship is vital for fostering disciples and leaders who can propagate the gospel. The book critiques the reliance solely on the Bible, limited exploration of relationships, and lack of discussion on the negative impacts of mentoring. Overall, it raises questions about how Christian mentoring can address harmful practices.",
    "The study of rhetorical tools used by public figures in their speeches offers invaluable insights into how persuasive communication works.

This examination of Obama's speech demonstrates how the strategic use of rhetoric, including logic and emotion, can enhance the impact of a message, create a strong connection with the audience, and ultimately drive meaningful change.",
    "Globalization is an undeniable force shaping our geopolitical and cultural landscapes in recent decades. Thanks to the Internet, individuals are connecting across continents like never before, giving rise to a new interconnected world. This has paved the way for a shared global culture that embraces the diverse traditions of all people. However, this cultural fusion is not without its challenges, as stronger national cultures often overshadow weaker ones, sparking a rise in nationalistic sentiments among marginalized communities.\n\nWhile some view globalization as a threat to cultural and political sovereignty, others see it as a natural progression in human evolution. It has opened up endless possibilities for individuals to access information, music, and literature from around the globe in mere moments, leading to a more interconnected world. Yet, radical nationalism poses a significant barrier to this unity, fueling international conflicts that hinder progress.\n\nRather than labeling globalization as inherently good or bad, it should be embraced as a transformative milestone in our collective journey. While it brings both benefits and drawbacks, it is an inevitable reality. As we navigate this new era of interconnectedness, it is essential for society and governments to address radical nationalism as a critical issue that threatens our shared future.",

    "\"The Passing of Traditional Societies,\" written by Lerner, is a study based on empirical data gathered through fieldwork and interviews conducted in various countries over a decade. Lerner's central argument is that societies around the world tend to modernize following a trajectory established by Western nations that underwent modernization earlier. This trajectory, often referred to as the \"Western model,\" is considered a global phenomenon by Lerner, a label influenced by historical circumstances. The initial modernization processes of secularization, urbanization, and industrialization were pioneered by North Atlantic countries. Lerner focuses on lifestyle modernization by examining factors such as increasing population mobility, literacy rates, and the influence of mass media.\n\nOne of the main obstacles to modernization that Lerner identifies is ethnocentrism, which he believes hampers societal development. He emphasizes how Western influences have challenged traditional societies in the Middle East, paving the way for the establishment of more efficient modern structures. Lerner critiques the tendency of societies to prioritize cultural identity over progress. He argues that the concept of modernization, which emerged in the post-World War II era to facilitate the transition from \"backwardness\" to \"modernity,\" oversimplifies historical processes by presenting them as linear and lacking alternatives.\n\nHowever, Lerner's proposed paradigm fails to explain the unique development trajectories of countries like China, Russia, and Cuba, rendering it less relevant in the contemporary world.",

    "Ancient Rome was a multicultural society, largely because the Roman Empire controlled vast territories and incorporated various local populations and cultures. The Roman civilization had a diverse population with genetic roots more similar to Mediterranean states than Western Europe. This diversity was evident in cultures like Gauls, Greeks, Syrians, Egyptians, Lebanese, Persians, and others living under Roman rule. Rome's success was attributed to its ability to blend different ethnic and national identities, absorbing foreign cultural elements into its own traditions. During the Pax Romana period of peace and prosperity, various cultures coexisted harmoniously under Roman rule. Despite imposing certain values on conquered regions, Rome generally allowed people to practice their religions, traditions, and laws. Ancient Greece strongly influenced Roman culture, particularly in areas like architecture, art, philosophy, and politics. The Etruscans, a neighboring tribe, also played a role in shaping early Roman development with their military capabilities.",

    "McDonald’s is facing a lawsuit in the United States against its former CEO, Steve Easterbrook, for engaging in hidden consensual sexual encounters with workers before his departure. Easterbrook misled authorities and discarded evidence of his misconduct, putting his personal interests above those of McDonald’s. Shareholders are also taking legal action against the corporation for allegedly prioritizing speed over accuracy in addressing misconduct issues and attempting to cover up wrongdoing. Negligent recruitment and retention, which refer to an employer's obligation not to recruit or retain a worker who may pose a risk, are key factors in such cases.\n\nEmployers, like McDonald’s, have a duty to thoroughly vet employees before hiring them, ensuring they meet the necessary qualifications and have no history of misconduct that could harm others. Failure to properly screen employees, such as an executive chef, can result in the employer being held liable for any harm caused by the employee's actions. This is a common scenario where criminal background checks play a crucial role in preventing potential risks in the workplace. If an employer is aware of an employee's inappropriate behavior but fails to take appropriate action, they may be held responsible for any harm caused as a result of their negligence in ensuring a safe work environment.",
