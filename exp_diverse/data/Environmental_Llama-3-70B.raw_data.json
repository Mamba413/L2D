This innovative approach generates returns for investors from multiple agencies that benefit from the mitigation work. \n\nFurthermore, the Insurance Group established a $25 million fund to invest in projects that reduce excess fuels and overgrowth in forests, converting them into usable energy, biochar, and building products. This initiative achieves a triple bottom line by improving the environment, creating jobs in rural communities, and producing sustainable commodities. \n\nAdditionally, the Insurance Group invested $35 million in a fund to build and lease advanced greenhouses for growing fresh fruits and vegetables.

    "As a collective of vehicle and property insurance providers, the cumulative portfolio of the Insurance Group has consistently been vulnerable to environmental or atmospheric-related damages of a potentially shifting or disastrous nature. As a consequence, our policy offerings, risk assessment, pricing, and reinsurance, among other considerations, have always been crafted with meticulous attention to the potential recurrence and intensity of extensive and multiple damages caused by environmental or atmospheric fluctuations, and trends in damages are analyzed and monitored to inform ongoing decision-making regarding those factors.\n\nMore recently, the prolonged dry spell in California, exacerbated by environmental change, has subjected California woodlands and grasslands to immense strain and elevated risk of wildfires. In 2017, we obtained regulatory approval to utilize Fireline, a product developed by ISO to measure wildfire exposure for rating and underwriting purposes. This will both minimize our risk in wildfire-prone territories and ensure adequate pricing.\n\nThe Insurance Group has dedicated management for catastrophic exposure, and is continually reassessing its catastrophe business strategies in light of available data and technology. Environmental risk is perpetually factored into our insurance and corporate operations. Nonetheless, we acknowledge that as additional information and metrics regarding environmental risk are developed, supplementary evaluation of available data will be required to project and prepare for future damages to the properties and vehicles we insure.\n\nEnvironmental and atmospheric-related damages can also occur to the property and personnel of the Insurance Group, and it is crucial that we remain able to conduct operations following any such loss in order to meet our contractual obligations to the customers we insure. To that end, we maintain geographically-separated and redundant capabilities, backed up by disaster-contingency plans, and have a large workforce that can be redeployed to affected areas as needed.\n\nGeographically, we are exposed to brush fire primarily in California and the western states; convective storm and hail in the mid-western states, including Oklahoma, Kansas, eastern Colorado, Indiana, and Ohio; and hurricane in New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Delaware. As noted earlier, we do not directly write in the Gulf Coast or lower-Atlantic states and therefore have a significantly lower hurricane exposure than many other homeowner and vehicle insurers.",

We have identified two primary risk categories: Transition Risks and Physical Risks.\n\n**Transition Risks**\n\nThe most significant transition risk we face is the potential damage to our reputation due to increased stakeholder concern and negative feedback about our climate change management practices. To address this risk, we have established an Office of Corporate Responsibility, report to the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), and publish a Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) report on our website. This report outlines our approach to managing environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations, including climate change, and our progress towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions and enhancing business continuity planning.\n\n**Physical Risks**\n\nExtreme weather events, such as tornadoes, hurricanes, and floods, pose a significant threat to our facilities and workforce. To mitigate these risks, we conduct continuous business impact analysis and have established local and specialized incident management teams in our facilities, business, and technology areas. These teams are led by subject matter experts and are equipped to respond quickly and effectively in the event of a severe weather event.\n\nIn the event of a severe weather event, our dedicated crisis management team uses a situational awareness tool and information from local teams to track and respond to the situation.

    "At our company, we recognize the significant impact of climate change on the global economy and the potential risks it poses to our investments. Our investment managers take a proactive approach, carefully considering the effects of climate change on various sectors and industries when making informed investment decisions. \n\nWhile our diversified portfolio is designed to minimize exposure to any one company, sector, or region, we acknowledge that climate change can still have far-reaching consequences. To mitigate these risks, our investment guidelines include strict limits on credit quality, duration, single issuer, and sector exposure. \n\nOur investment managers are committed to incorporating environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations into their daily decision-making process. This includes avoiding investments in utility companies with 'stranded assets' due to their reliance on fossil fuels and limiting exposure to insurance-related entities that are highly correlated with climate change. \n\nHowever, we don't shy away from investing in companies that may have exposure to climate change if their valuations are attractive and can generate strong returns for our clients. Our investment decisions are guided by thorough fundamental analysis, which helps reduce downside risk and maximize returns.",

    "RQIH does not manage its investment portfolio internally. Instead, it has discretionary mandates with three external managers, who are governed by Investment Management Agreements (IMAs) and monitored through Clearwater and regular investment reports. All three managers have Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) policies in place, which include considerations for climate change. These policies are reviewed periodically, and they are available upon request.\n\nP&R, one of the managers, uses the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board's (SASB) industry standards to assess issuers. They also utilize MSCI ESG Research and Bloomberg as data analysis tools, and work with Glass Lewis, a proxy voting firm, to evaluate the ESG performance of portfolio companies. Climate change is a key factor in P&R's ESG considerations, and they prioritize corporates and sovereigns with policies aimed at mitigating its effects. P&R has received an A+ rating, the highest score, from the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (UN PRI) for its ESG screening.\n\nGTAM, another manager, tracks ESG factors using its proprietary software, PRISM, and also references the SASB and UN PRI guidelines. GTAM supports various ESG investment tools and bodies, including the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures and the Transition Pathway Initiative, which aims to reduce emissions in line with the Paris Agreement.\n\nTo answer question 5b, RQIH has not instructed its investment managers to alter their approach to managing the portfolio, as the Group is satisfied with their existing ESG policies.",
