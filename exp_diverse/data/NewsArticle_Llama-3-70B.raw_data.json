    "The full cost of damage in Newton Stewart, one of the areas worst affected, is still being assessed. Repair work is ongoing in Hawick and many roads in Peeblesshire remain badly affected by standing water. Trains on the west coast mainline face disruption due to damage at the Lamington Viaduct. Many businesses and householders were affected by flooding in Newton Stewart after the River Cree overflowed into the town. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon visited the area to inspect the damage. The waters breached a retaining wall, flooding many commercial properties on Victoria Street - the main shopping thoroughfare. Jeanette Tate, who owns the Cinnamon Cafe which was badly affected, said she could not fault the multi-agency response once the flood hit. However, she said more preventative work could have been carried out to ensure the retaining wall did not fail. \"It is difficult but I do think there is so much publicity for Dumfries and the Nith - and I totally appreciate that - but it is almost like we're neglected or forgotten,\" she said. \"That may not be true but it is perhaps my perspective over the last few days. \"Why were you not ready to help us a bit more when the warning and the alarm alerts had gone out?\" Meanwhile, a flood alert remains in place across the Borders because of the constant rain. Peebles was badly hit by problems, sparking calls to introduce more defences in the area. Scottish Borders Council has put a list on its website of the roads worst affected and drivers have been urged not to ignore closure signs. The Labour Party's deputy Scottish leader Alex Rowley was in Hawick on Monday to see the situation first hand. He said it was important to get the flood protection plan right but backed calls to speed up the process. \"I was quite taken aback by the amount of damage that has been done,\" he said. \"Obviously it is heart-breaking for people who have been forced out of their homes and the impact on businesses.\" He said it was important that \"immediate steps\" were taken to protect the areas most vulnerable and a clear timetable put in place for flood prevention plans.

    "A fire alarm went off at the Holiday Inn in Hope Street at about 04:20 BST on Saturday and guests were asked to leave the hotel. As they gathered outside they saw the two buses, parked side-by-side in the car park, engulfed by flames. One of the tour groups is from Germany, the other from China and Taiwan. It was their first night in Northern Ireland. The driver of one of the buses said many of the passengers had left personal belongings on board and these had been destroyed. Both groups have organised replacement coaches and will begin their tour of the north coast later than they had planned. Police have appealed for information about the attack. Insp David Gibson said: \"It appears as though the fire started under one of the buses before spreading to the second. \"While the exact cause is still under investigation, it is thought that the fire was started deliberately.\"",
    "John Edward Bates, formerly of Spalding, Lincolnshire, but now living in London, faces a total of 22 charges, including two counts of indecency with a child. The 67-year-old is accused of committing the offences between March 1972 and October 1989. Mr Bates denies all the charges. Grace Hale, prosecuting, told the jury that the allegations of sexual abuse were made by made by four male complainants and related to when Mr Bates was a scout leader in South Lincolnshire and Cambridgeshire. \"The defendant says nothing of that sort happened between himself and all these individuals. He says they are all fabricating their accounts and telling lies,\" said Mrs Hale. The prosecutor claimed Mr Bates invited one 15 year old to his home offering him the chance to look at cine films made at scout camps but then showed him pornographic films. She told the jury that the boy was then sexually abused leaving him confused and frightened. Mrs Hale said: \"The complainant's recollection is that on a number of occasions sexual acts would happen with the defendant either in the defendant's car or in his cottage.\" She told the jury a second boy was taken by Mr Bates for a weekend in London at the age of 13 or 14 and after visiting pubs he was later sexually abused. Mrs Hale said two boys from the Spalding group had also made complaints of being sexually abused. The jury has been told that Mr Bates was in the RAF before serving as a Lincolnshire Police officer between 1976 and 1983. The trial, which is expected to last two weeks, continues.",
    "Patients and staff were evacuated from Cerahpasa hospital on Wednesday after a man receiving treatment at the clinic threatened to shoot himself and others. Officers were deployed to negotiate with the man, a young police officer. Earlier reports that the armed man had taken several people hostage proved incorrect. The chief consultant of Cerahpasa hospital, Zekayi Kutlubay, who was evacuated from the facility, said that there had been \"no hostage crises\", adding that the man was \"alone in the room\". Dr Kutlubay said that the man had been receiving psychiatric treatment for the past two years. He said that the hospital had previously submitted a report stating that the man should not be permitted to carry a gun. \"His firearm was taken away,\" Dr Kutlubay said, adding that the gun in the officer's possession on Wednesday was not his issued firearm. The incident comes amid tension in Istanbul following several attacks in crowded areas, including the deadly assault on the Reina nightclub on New Year's Eve which left 39 people dead.",
    "Veronica Vanessa Chango-Alverez, 31, was killed and another man injured when an Audi A3 struck them in Streatham High Road at 05:30 GMT on Saturday. Ten minutes before the crash the car was in London Road, Croydon, when a Volkswagen Passat collided with a tree. Police want to trace Nathan Davis, 27, who they say has links to the Audi. The car was abandoned at the scene. Ms Chango-Alverez died from multiple injuries, a post-mortem examination found. No arrests have been made as yet, police said. Ms Chango-Alverez was staying at her mother's home in Streatham High Road. She was born in Ecuador and had lived in London for 13 years, BBC London reporter Gareth Furby said. At the time of the crash, she was on her way to work in a hotel. The remains of the bus stop, which was extensively damaged in the crash, have been removed. Flowers have been left at the site in tribute to the victim. A statement from her brother Kevin Raul Chango-Alverez said: \"My family has had its heart torn out, at this Christmas time, we will never be the same again. \"On Friday night we were together as a family with Veronica meeting her newly born nephew and preparing for Christmas. \"I last saw her alive as she left to go to work on Saturday morning, but moments later I was holding her hand as she passed away in the street.\" Describing the crash as \"horrific\" Det Insp Gordon Wallace, said: \"The family are devastated. The memory of this senseless death will be with them each time they leave their home. \"The driver fled the scene abandoning the grey Audi, which was extensively damaged. \"We are looking to speak to Mr Nathan Davis in relation to this collision.\" The 51-year-old man injured at the bus stop remains in a critical condition in hospital while the condition of the 29-year-old driver of the Volkswagen is now stable.",
    "Belgian cyclist Demoitie died after a collision with a motorbike during Belgium's Gent-Wevelgem race. The 25-year-old was hit by the motorbike after several riders came down in a crash as the race passed through northern France. \"The main issues come when cars or motorbikes have to pass the peloton and pass riders,\" Team Sky's Rowe said. \"That is the fundamental issue we're looking into. \"There's a lot of motorbikes in and around the race whether it be cameras for TV, photographers or police motorbikes. \"In total there's around 50 motorbikes that work on each race. \"We've got a riders union and we're coming together to think of a few ideas, whether we cap a speed limit on how fast they can overtake us. \"Say we put a 10 kilometres per hour limit on it, if we're going 50kph they're only allowed to pass us 60kph or something like that.\" Demoitie, who was riding for the Wanty-Gobert team, was taken to hospital in Lille but died later. The sport's governing body, the UCI, said it would co-operate with all relevant authorities in an investigation into the incident. The Professional Cyclists' Association (CPA) issued a statement asking what would be done to improve safety. Despite Demoitie's death, attitudes to road racing will stay the same says Rowe, who has been competing in Three Days of De Panne race in Belgium. \"As soon as that element of fear slips into your mind and you start thinking of things that could happen, that's when you're doomed to fail,\" he told BBC Wales Sport. \"If you start thinking about crashes and the consequences and what could potentially happen then you're never going to be at the front of the peloton and you're never going to win any races.\" In a separate incident, another Belgian cyclist, Daan Myngheer, 22, died in hospital after suffering a heart attack during the first stage of the Criterium International in Corsica.",
    "Gundogan, 26, told BBC Sport he \"can see the finishing line\" after tearing cruciate knee ligaments in December, but will not rush his return. The German missed the 2014 World Cup following back surgery that kept him out for a year, and sat out Euro 2016 because of a dislocated kneecap. He said: \"It is heavy mentally to accept that.\" Gundogan will not be fit for the start of the Premier League season at Brighton on 12 August but said his recovery time is now being measured in \"weeks\" rather than months. He told BBC Sport: \"It is really hard always to fall and fight your way back. You feel good and feel ready, then you get the next kick. \"The worst part is behind me now. I want to feel ready when I am fully back. I want to feel safe and confident. I don't mind if it is two weeks or six.\" Gundogan made 15 appearances and scored five goals in his debut season for City following his £20m move from Borussia Dortmund. He is eager to get on the field again and was impressed at the club's 4-1 win over Real Madrid in a pre-season game in Los Angeles on Wednesday. Manager Pep Guardiola has made five new signings already this summer and continues to have an interest in Arsenal forward Alexis Sanchez and Monaco's Kylian Mbappe. Gundogan said: \"Optimism for the season is big. It is huge, definitely. \"We felt that last year as well but it was a completely new experience for all of us. We know the Premier League a bit more now and can't wait for the season to start.\" City complete their three-match tour of the United States against Tottenham in Nashville on Saturday. Chelsea manager Antonio Conte said earlier this week he did not feel Tottenham were judged by the same standards as his own side, City and Manchester United. Spurs have had the advantage in their recent meetings with City, winning three and drawing one of their last four Premier League games. And Gundogan thinks they are a major threat. He said: \"Tottenham are a great team. They have the style of football. They have young English players. Our experience last season shows it is really tough to beat them. \"They are really uncomfortable to play against. \"I am pretty sure, even if they will not say it loud, the people who know the Premier League know Tottenham are definitely a competitor for the title.\"",
    "The crash happened about 07:20 GMT at the junction of the A127 and Progress Road in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex. The man, who police said is aged in his 20s, was treated at the scene for a head injury and suspected multiple fractures, the ambulance service said. He was airlifted to the Royal London Hospital for further treatment. The Southend-bound carriageway of the A127 was closed for about six hours while police conducted their initial inquiries. A spokeswoman for Essex Police said it was not possible comment to further as this time as the \"investigation is now being conducted by the IPCC\".",

    "Weaknesses in the way mice swapped data with computers left them vulnerable, said security firm Bastille Networks. Attackers could spoof poorly protected signals letting them use PCs as if they were sitting in front of them, it said. Information about the loopholes have been passed to the makers of vulnerable mice, some of who are creating updates to make the mice more secure. The radio signals sent by many wireless mice to a \"dongle\" plugged in to a computer were often unencrypted, said Marc Newlin and Balint Seeber, from Bastille, who carried out the research. \"That makes it possible for the attacker to send unencrypted traffic to the dongle pretending to be a keyboard and have it result as keystrokes on your computer,\" Mr Newlin said. By contrast, they said, signals sent by wireless keyboards were scrambled to stop attackers eavesdropping on or spoofing them. The pair found they could spoof signals for mice using a few lines of code and an antenna and dongle that cost $20 (Â£15). The attack worked at distances of up to 180m (590ft). Using this kit, they sent specially crafted mouse clicks that a computer interpreted as key presses, letting them run commands and take control of a target machine. The Bastille researchers said many companies spent a lot of time and money securing the physical devices sitting on their networks but often neglected to keep an eye on data sent via radio. Wireless mice produced by HP, Lenovo, Amazon and Dell were found to be vulnerable. Bastille said it had reported its findings to the hardware makers and to the company that made the chipset used inside the spoofable mice. Updates to the internal computer code, or firmware, for some of the vulnerable mice are now being made available, But Bastille said many of the insecure mice it had found could not be updated.",
    "Administrators confirmed the redundancies affecting 38 staff at Galashiels-based Murray and Burrell. The business, established in 1928, went into administration last week citing \"adverse trading conditions\". There are hopes some of the workers affected could find posts at another building firm in nearby Melrose which currently requires staff. Thomson Cooper partner Richard Gardiner was appointed as administrator at Murray and Burrell on Monday. A statement confirmed: \"Directors explored all options in an effort to preserve trading and jobs. \"Regrettably, 38 jobs were lost as there is no prospect of continuing to trade.\" South of Scotland MSP Rachael Hamilton described it as a \"sad day for the Borders\". However, some of the workers laid off could find employment with a Melrose-based company. JS Crawford has said that, with several housing projects on its books, it needs staff.",
    "The EC's doubts about the arrangement were detailed in a document on Friday. The EC said that its \"preliminary view is that the tax ruling... by Luxembourg in favour of Amazon constitutes state aid.\" However, Amazon said it \"has received no special tax treatment from Luxembourg\". \"We are subject to the same tax laws as other companies operating here [in Luxembourg],\" it said. The Luxembourg finance ministry said: \"Luxembourg is confident that the state aid allegations in this case are without merit and will be able to convince the Commission of the legitimacy of the anticipatory decision in question and that no competitive advantage was granted,\" it said. The European Commission began a probe of the tax arrangement last year, saying that it had suspicions it broke EU rules. The Commission document, which was sent to the Luxembourg Ministry of Foreign Affairs in October, gives its rationale for launching the investigation. The Commission said it had \"no indication\" that the tax arrangement was \"compatible with the internal market\". The current European Commission chief, Jean-Claude Juncker, was prime minister of Luxembourg when the deal was struck. Mr Juncker has come under pressure over claims that around 340 global companies were granted tax  avoidance deals during his 18 year tenure in Luxembourg. Commission doubts over the Amazon deal included whether Luxembourg had properly looked into Amazon's \"transfer pricing\" proposals about how money would be moved between different Amazon subsidiaries. Doubts also existed about whether the country had assessed that the proposed tax regime was in line with market conditions before agreeing the deal in 2003, the European Commission document said. The Commission also had questions about how royalty payments between certain Amazon companies were calculated, and whether \"Amazon has a financial incentive to exaggerate the amount of the royalty\" between its Luxembourg head office company and an Amazon firm that holds shares in the head office company. \"If the royalty is exaggerated, it would unduly reduce the tax paid by Amazon in Luxembourg by shifting profits to an untaxed entity from the perspective of corporate taxation,\" the EC said. It added that Luxembourg might have been too hasty in assessing Amazon's requested arrangement before striking the deal. Luxembourg's finance ministry said it \"has provided all the information required by the Commission and cooperated fully with the Commission in its investigation.\" \"Among other things, detailed reports on the transfer price requested by the Commission were disclosed,\" it added. Luxembourg is also being investigated by the Commission over suspected \"sweetheart\" tax deals with the financing arm of carmaker Fiat. In addition, Ireland's tax deal with Apple and the Netherlands' arrangement with Starbucks are being scrutinised as part of a crackdown on multinationals' tax avoidance schemes.",
    "The three-day extravaganza of farming, food and family fun celebrates many aspects of agricultural life. The Balmoral Show is run by the Royal Ulster Agricultural Society (RUAS) and dates back 148 years. Last year, it attracted more than 90,000 visitors to its recently-adopted home outside Lisburn in County Antrim. It was traditionally staged at the RUAS's headquarters in south Belfast, but the show moved to a larger venue on the site of the former Maze prison in 2013. The Maze venue, re-named Balmoral Park, is now hosting the show for the fourth consecutive year. The 2016 event coincides with Northern Ireland's Year of Food and Drink, and local produce features prominently in the exhibitions. One of this year's highlights is an \"edible garden\", in which visitors can see their food growing in the ground before it gets to their plates. The aim of the garden is to encourage people to grow their own food at home. The event will also showcase the best of local livestock, with prized pigs, cattle, poultry and ponies all lining up in bid to be the stars of the show. Their owners will also get a chance to shine, with horse riding and show jumping displays along with sheep shearing competitions and awards for the best livestock breeders and handlers. For younger visitors, there is a family fun area hosting displays from the Northern Ireland School of Falconry as well as a gun dog skills demonstration and a performance from balloon artist Bruce Airhead. BBC News NI are covering the event live on social media on Wednesday on Twitter at @BBCNewsNI, on Snapchat at bbcnewsni, and on BBC Newsline's Facebook page.",
    "Mr Mosley wants Google to block photos of him at a sex party first printed in the now-defunct News of the World, which he successfully sued in 2008. He is suing the internet firm for breaches of the Data Protection Act and misusing private information. Google's barrister argued that Mr Mosley no longer has a \"reasonable expectation of privacy\". Mr Mosley won damages from the News of the World after it published a story alleging he had organised a Nazi-themed orgy. Photographs and a video which show his private sexual activity were originally obtained by News Group Newspapers Limited (NGN) in a clandestine \"sting\" operation. Mr Mosley - the son of 1930s fascist leader Sir Oswald Mosley - won Â£60,000 after a judge ruled there was no substance to the allegation that there had been a Nazi theme to the sex party and found that his privacy had been breached. In that ruling, the High Court also said the article was not in the public interest. Mr Mosley has said the role-play at a rented Chelsea basement flat was harmless, consensual and private. On launching his legal action last year, Mr Mosley urged: \"Google should operate within the law rather than according to rules it makes itself. It cannot be allowed to ignore judgements in our courts.\" Google has said it will remove URLs that it is alerted to, but is not prepared to remove the images entirely from its search engines. In court on Wednesday, Google's barrister Antony White QC for Google conceded that it was technically possible to remove the images and was \"not burdensome\" to do so. However, he argued that Google was not the publisher of the private information, and that Mr Mosley no longer had a reasonable expectation of privacy in relation to the images. On that basis, Google will seek to show that Mr Mosley's claim is unfounded. The hearing is due to conclude on Thursday.",

Eddie has been excellent all year for us, he has really stepped up to the mark and will be a big loss.\" However, Jones says Jackson's misfortune can be a chance for others to thrive. \"We are very fortunate to have the likes of Ollie Griffiths, Harrison Keddie, James Thomas who can come into the back-row,\" said Jackson. \"Harri has shown glimpses of what he can do all season and there's definitely a player there, so this is an opportunity.\" Dragons travel to Munster in the Pro12 on Friday.",
    "The announcement ends months of uncertainty for Cornish Language Partnership staff whose contracts had been due to end. Local government minister Andrew Stunnell said the three-year funding package for the service would help make sure the language survived. But he warned that long term funding should come from Cornwall. He said it was \"important to make sure the Cornish were given the opportunity to put down sound foundations.\" \"In the longer term support for the Cornish language is going to be something which is going to have to be based in Cornwall and will not come from London,\" he added. The Cornish Language Partnership's, Jennifer Lowe, said: \"We can now plan for the future thanks to the funding.\" The United Nations recently upgraded the status of the Cornish language from \"extinct\" to \"critically endangered\".

Monaco finished eight points ahead of nearest rivals Paris St-Germain to be crowned champions of France in 2016-17. \"I feel part of AS Monaco and the principality,\" said Portuguese Jardim, the former Olympiakos boss. Monaco also beat Tottenham and Manchester City on their way to reaching the semi-finals of the Champions League during 2016-17, before losing to Juventus 4-1 on aggregate in the semi-finals.

    "A State Department spokesman said the election process was flawed and could not be seen as free and fair. He said the Ortega government had side-lined opposition candidates and limited monitoring of the polls. Daniel Ortega won 72.5% of the vote with 99.8% of the ballots counted. His closest rival, centre-right candidate Maximino Rodriguez, only received 14.2% of the vote. The State Department's Mark Toner  said the Ortega government had not invited international election observers, which he said, \"further degraded the legitimacy of the election\". \"We continue to press the Nicaraguan government to uphold democratic practices, including press freedom and respect for universal human rights in Nicaragua,\" he added. Mr Ortega had been widely expected to win both due to the popularity of his social programmes and because he faced no obvious political challenger. A former left-wing rebel, Mr Ortega has led Nicaragua through a period of economic stability which has made him popular with the country's business sector and foreign investors. Supporters of Mr Ortega took to the streets to celebrate his victory. But even before the first results were announced, members of the opposition coalition Broad Front for Democracy (FAD) called the elections a \"farce\". The FAD, which had urged voters to boycott the election, alleged that more than 70% had abstained from voting. They were contradicted by the electoral authorities which put voter participation at 65.8%. Mr Ortega's running mate was his wife, Rosario Murillo, who now looks set to become vice-president. Analysts say that Ms Murillo already shares decision-making with Mr Ortega and could become president if her 70-year-old husband were to bow out. Nicaragua's economy has grown at double the Latin American average, but the country still needs to attract more foreign investment. A $50bn (£40bn) plan to build an interoceanic canal across Nicaragua with Chinese investment has gained international attention, but there are serious doubts over whether it will ever be built. The country has been able to avoid the sky-high murder rates of some of its Central American neighbours but it also faces the ever pervasive threat of drug-trafficking.",
    "The decision comes after 170,000 activists from around the world demanded action to help lesbians targeted for \"corrective rape\". The authorities have been accused of not doing enough following the recent killing and rape of lesbian activist Noxolo Nogwaza. Police say they do not consider sexual orientation when investigating murder. \"To us, murder is murder, whether somebody is Zulu, English, male or female - we don't see colour, we don't see gender,\" police ministry spokesman Zweli Mnisi told the BBC on Tuesday, after rights groups urged the police to do more to find those responsible Ms Nogwaza's death. She was stoned, stabbed and gang-raped in the KwaThema township east of Johannesburg over the Easter weekend. Unlike in many African countries, homosexual acts are legal in South Africa and discrimination based on sexual orientation is banned, but activists say gay and lesbian people are often attacked in townships. They say \"corrective rape\" - when a lesbian is raped to either punish her, or \"correct\" her behaviour - is becoming increasingly common. Ndumie Funda, founder of the gay rights organisation Luleki Sizwe which works in 10 black townships and rural areas near Cape Town, welcomed the government's announcement. She said it was important to get \"corrective rape\" classified as a hate crime. \"The South African constitution is one of the highly respected and acknowledged constitutions and it says we are all equal; we're therefore reminding our government to say that this was being promised and we voted for you so we need protection,\" she told the BBC's Network Africa programme. Luleki Sizwe started an online petition at Change.org to get the government to take action. \"In less than six months, a tiny group of township activists has mobilised more than 170,000 people from 163 countries and gotten the highest levels of government to address their basic demand, that the sadistic crime of 'corrective rape' be taken seriously,\" Change.org representative Benjamin Joffe-Walt is quoted by the Sapa news agency as saying. Justice ministry spokesman Tlali Tlali said the the task team would begin its work in July and include six representatives from the judiciary, police and department of social development and six representatives from the gay community. \"The team will be charged with developing a legislative intervention plan, a public awareness strategy, and LGBTI [lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex]-sensitive shelters,\" he said. In 2008, female footballer and gay rights activist Eudy Simelane was also killed in KwaThema, some 80km (50 miles) east of Johannesburg. Two people were given long prison terms for her murder and rape, although prosecutors denied that her sexuality had been a motive.",
    "Big oil producing nations meet this weekend in Qatar to discuss plans for a freeze in production levels. But there is scepticism over whether such a deal would make much difference to the current oversupply of oil in the market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 28.97 points to 17,897.46. The S&P 500 was down 2.05 points to 2,080.73. The technology focused Nasdaq Composite slipped 7.67 points to 4,938.22.

Shares in banking giant Citigroup closed 0.13% down after trading mostly higher all day. It reported a 27% fall in quarterly profit, but that was not as bad as analysts had been expecting. Shares of Marathon Petroleum were down 3.8%, Exxon Mobile fell 0.5% and Chevron was 0.75% lower. Shares of Apple dropped 2% after a report suggested the company was cutting iPhone production in the April-June quarter due to weak sales. Investors also had a gloomy economic report to chew over.

    "Mr Varoufakis said Greece was subject to a programme that will \"go down in history as the greatest disaster of macroeconomic management ever\". The German parliament approved the opening of negotiations on Friday. The bailout could total €86bn (£60bn) in exchange for austerity measures. In a damning assessment, Mr Varoufakis told the BBC's Mark Lobel: \"This programme is going to fail whoever undertakes its implementation.\" Asked how long that would take, he replied: \"It has failed already.\" Mr Varoufakis resigned earlier this month, in what was widely seen as a conciliatory gesture towards the eurozone finance ministers with whom he had clashed frequently. He said Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, who has admitted that he does not believe in the bailout, had little option but to sign. \"We were given a choice between being executed and capitulating. And he decided that capitulation was the optimal strategy.\" Mr Tsipras has announced a cabinet reshuffle, sacking several ministers who voted against the reforms in parliament this week. But he opted not to bring in technocrats or opposition politicians as replacements. As a result, our correspondent says, Mr Tsipras will preside over ministers who, like himself, harbour serious doubts about the reform programme. Greece must pass further reforms on Wednesday next week to secure the bailout. Germany was the last of the eurozone countries needing parliamentary approval to begin the talks. But the head of the group of eurozone finance ministers, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, has warned that the process will not be easy, saying he expected the negotiations to take four weeks. On Saturday, the Greek government ordered banks to open on Monday following three weeks of closures. But the decree stated that the weekly withdrawal limit should be a maximum €420. Separately, the European Council approved the €7bn bridging loan for Greece from an EU-wide emergency fund. The loan was approved in principle by eurozone ministers on Thursday and now has the go-ahead from all non-euro states. It means Greece will now be able to repay debts to two of its creditors, the ECB and International Monetary Fund (IMF), due on Monday.",
    "The IPC opened proceedings against the National Paralympic Committee of Russia after a report claimed the country had operated a widespread doping programme. A decision on any ban will come in the week commencing 1 August. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has opted against a blanket ban. \"I can assure you that our board will take the right decision in the interest of sport and the interest of the Paralympic movement moving forward,\" said Craven. On Sunday, the IOC said it would leave it up to the governing bodies of individual sports to decide if Russian competitors are clean and should be allowed to take part. But Craven, himself a member of the IOC, was critical of that decision and said the IPC would not necessarily follow suit. \"I am disappointed in their decision, but that is a personal view,\" he added. \"We have to acknowledge their right to take such a decision. This is ultra-serious. I don't think there has been a situation in the past where you have had institutional doping on such a scale. \"We believe the Russian NPC is either unwilling or unable to uphold the IPC anti-doping code, which is in line with the World Anti-Doping Agency code, so that is what they have to respond to.\" Canadian law professor Richard McLaren's report, published last week, claimed Russia operated a state-sponsored doping programme from 2011 to 2015. The IPC said it acted after McLaren provided the names of the athletes associated with the 35 \"disappearing positive samples\" from the Moscow laboratory highlighted in the report. Nineteen samples potentially doctored as part of the sample-swapping regime during the 2014 Sochi Paralympic Winter Games have been sent for further analysis. Russia will have up to 21 days to appeal against any IPC decision, with the Rio Paralympics due to begin on 7 September.",

King is not financially involved in the team but will take a leading role on the business side of the operation. Fitzpatrick's investment is a personal one and the money he has put into the team does not come from Ovo. He said: \"I have a lifelong passion for F1 and can't wait for the season ahead.\" Manor Marussia have announced Englishman Will Stevens will be one of their drivers and said a deal to sign the second would be completed soon. The team's new car, a modified version of the 2014 model, must pass F1's mandatory crash tests before they can race at the season-opening Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne from 13-15 March. Those tests are scheduled to take place this week. Graeme Lowdon, who has been with the team through its various guises as Manor, Virgin and Marussia, remains as president and sporting director. He said: \"It has been a challenging period for all of us but we've come through it and now we just want to go racing again. \"With formidable new business leadership in Stephen Fitzpatrick and the board presence of Justin King, we are now in a great place ahead of the new season. This is a fantastic and very rewarding moment for all those involved with the team.\"",
    "The destination of a stimulus package worth nearly £39m was agreed as part of the Welsh government's budget deal with the Liberal Democrats. Finance Minister Jane Hutt said it would help \"generate immediate benefits\" for the economy. But Plaid Cymru said it was \"completely inadequate\" and the Conservatives said it should go to council tax payers. Labour and the Lib Dems announced a budget deal on Friday night, ending weeks of negotiations between ministers and opposition parties. With 30 of the assembly's 60 seats, Labour needs the help of at least one other party to approve its spending plans. The £38.9m windfall - to be spent over two years - also formed part of budget discussions. The money is coming down from the Treasury as a result of a council tax freeze in England. A programme to help businesses hire young recruits is among projects receiving funding. The government said an extra £4.9m would create 1,800 more apprenticeships. Some £9m will go towards upgrading school buildings, with the same amount spent on delivering an additional 130 homes. The government will spend £3.5 improving roads in places where it is planning to create enterprise zones. Five parts of Wales have been earmarked as zones where businesses will get help to grow. First Minister Carwyn Jones has said that copying the UK government by using the money to keep down council tax would not significantly benefit the economy, adding that tax bills for band D homes were lower on average in Wales. Labour has faced criticism from opponents, particularly Plaid Cymru, for not doing enough to respond to a deteriorating economic situation. Ms Hutt pointed to other government spending commitments, intended to help growth. She said she had considered proposals to spend the money from across the government. She said: \"This package builds on those actions to boost the economy and develop public services, generating immediate benefits for our economy while complementing our long term aims.\" Conservative shadow finance minister Paul Davies said he was disappointed ministers were using additional resources to \"top up\" existing policies. He said: \"There is nothing new in this package other than a fresh attempt by Welsh Labour ministers to be seen to act on the economy, while spending money which would be better spent by taxpayers themselves.\" Welsh Lib Dem leader Kirsty Williams said her party will also work with the government on how to spend any money allocated to Wales as a result of Tuesday's Autumn Statement by Chancellor George Osborne. \"The Welsh Liberal Democrats approach will be to continue to get our economy moving and improve the quality of life for people in Wales,\" she said. Plaid Cymru economy spokesman Alun Ffred Jones said: \"For over six months, Labour has sat back and done nothing - exposing Wales to the full force of this economic crisis. \"Now, they're trying desperately to create the impression that this small sum of money will do what's needed. Quite simply, it will not.\"",
    "Network Rail and Thames Water engineers are at the scene after the hole appeared in Forest Hill on Monday. The disruption is expected to last until Wednesday, with Southern, Thameslink and London Overground services affected. Thames Water said a sewer under the track had collapsed. It said the repair work was \"extremely complex\" and that engineers had located the problem section of the sewer and were working to seal it. Dry concrete has been put into the hole, forming a base to pour wet concrete on top. Once it has set, about 50 tonnes of ballast will be inserted, with the aim of opening the railway on Wednesday. Network Rail has closed all four lines between East Croydon and London Bridge, meaning Southern services to London Bridge are either cancelled or diverted. London Overground services are not running between West Croydon/Crystal Palace and New Cross Gate. Carl Leadbetter, Thames Water's regional network manager, said: \"Our teams continue to work as fast as possible on this critical job. \"While we need to work quickly to reopen the train lines, we also need to consider local residents, who will potentially suffer from sewer flooding if the pipe is not properly enclosed. \"This is an extremely complex job as the pipe is in a difficult location in the tracks and six metres below the ground.\" Network Rail apologised for the delays and said it was working \"as hard as possible\" to get the problem fixed by Wednesday morning's rush hour. Spokesman Chris Denham said the hole \"couldn't be in a worse place\". \"This is a massive piece of railway,\" he told BBC Radio London. \"It's the equivalent of shutting the A2 out of London in the morning. It's absolutely huge.\" Some passengers expressed their frustration on social media, mentioning how the problem occurred on the hottest day of the year so far. Elsewhere in London, high temperatures have been disrupting trains between the city and the West, with speeds being cut over fears of rails buckling. Trains coming out of Paddington, Euston and Liverpool Street all saw severe disruption. And Southern services heading to Brighton from Victoria were heavily disrupted following a track failure in the Gatwick area. It comes as commuters have experienced months of cancellations and delays on Southern trains due to an RMT dispute. New rail minister Paul Maynard will appear before the Commons Transport Select Committee on Wednesday to give evidence on the Department for Transport's role in the issue.

    "Overflow pipes at the Burry Inlet near Llanelli are used to help stop flooding. But the European Court of Justice ruled this broke clean water laws in a special conservation area. The Welsh Government, Natural Resources Wales and Welsh Water said they were investing in improvements. Though the UK has not been fined, it will have to pay legal costs in a case that also found a number of other breaches around the handling of waste water in England and Gibraltar. The problems stem from the UK's ageing Victorian sewers, engineering marvels of their time, but now out of date. The pipes were designed to mix both sewage and rainwater but over the years new housing developments and more frequent storms as a result of climate change have put pressure on the system. Welsh Water has 3,000 special overflow pipes which act as relief valves to deal with the extra sewage and rainwater but go straight into rivers and the sea. At the Burry Inlet there are 14 overflow pipes which discharge into an area supposed to be protected by UK and EU laws. It includes salt marshes and is a habitat for tens of thousands of wild birds during the winter. 2,200 hectares of saltmarsh - largest continuous area in Wales 20,000 waterfowl are supported 13,590  oystercatchers 35,000  wildbirds spend winter including curlew, godwit and shelduck The local cockling industry has also been hit but Welsh Water insisted this was not due to their discharges. It is investing in a Â£113m project to reduce the number of spills. RainScape involves reducing the amount of water that reaches the sewers through planting green spaces on streets and roofs to absorb rain and building channels to capture surface water. The UK argued the improvements would mean it could comply with EU clean water laws by 2020. However, the ECJ - which rules on disputes involving EU legislation - found the UK had acted \"too late\" and was failing in its obligations. Judges ruled spills contributed to the deterioration of water quality in the Loughor Estuary. A Welsh Government spokesman said: \"We will continue to work with Natural Resources Wales and Dwr Cymru on a Â£113m programme to reduce the number of spills, improve water quality and reduce the risk of local flooding by 2020.\" Welsh Water added: \"We have met the legal permits for water quality in the Loughor estuary and are aware of ever increasing environmental standards and the need to manage long-term challenges, such as climate change, in a truly sustainable away.\" The UK Government said all sites in England included in the judgement \"now comply with the directive and plans are in place elsewhere across the UK to deliver compliance by 2020 at the latest\".",

The former England playmaker was dropped at Cas for three games in March after an \"internal investigation\". Chase has swapped table toppers Castleford for bottom-of-the-table Widnes, who have won twice in 13 games. \"It is a great signing for us and I'm excited we've managed to pick up someone of Rangi's quality to come into the side,\" Betts told BBC Radio Merseyside. \"I know he's excited about playing as he wants to be playing regularly - he wants to start games and play 80 minutes. \"He comes here, he's got a clean slate and he wants to go again. \"He's up for the challenge as he knows we've got our backs against the wall, he knows the situation and he's been told that.

    "He is approaching the end of his 10th year in charge and thinks it is the right time to seek a fresh challenge. Cricket Scotland chairman Keith Oliver said: \"There is no doubt that the governing body of cricket in Scotland is unrecognisable from where we were in 2004. \"And the credit for this must go to Roddy and his staff.\" During Smith's time as chief executive, his management team have increased from eight to 25 and turnover has quadrupled. I am delighted that I leave an organisation in good health with a growing game and after a year of exceptional on-field performances by national teams at all levels Cricket Scotland reported a rise in participation figures for players, coaches and umpires during those 10 years. And the national side have secured a place at next year's World Cup finals in Australia and New Zealand by beating Kenya in a qualifying event. Oliver, who has worked with Smith during that whole period, said: \"Back then, we could not have imagined we would have won global qualifying events, played in world cups at youth and senior level, played One Day International games in front of thousands, run a fully professional national team as well as winning numerous development awards at a European and Global level. \"I and all at Cricket Scotland wish Roddy every success in his next role.\" Cricket Scotland will start the recruitment process to find Smith's successor with the aim of having a replacement in place early in the new year. Smith said: ''I have thoroughly enjoyed my time with Cricket Scotland and it's hard to believe it has been nearly a decade. \"I am delighted that I leave an organisation in good health with a growing game and after a year of exceptional on-field performances by national teams at all levels. \"Ten years is a long time for a chief executive of a national governing body and now feels exactly the right time to move on to my next challenge. \"With a Cricket World Cup to look forward to early next year and a number of newly-appointed quality staff to work with, I am looking forward to handing over to my successor an organisation that is very well placed to succeed in the future.\" Cricket Scotland announced in June that it plans a new \"world class\" base in Stirling, relocating from Edinburgh, with a new pavilion at the home of Stirling County Cricket Club designed to host international matches.",
    "The 130m-tall (420ft) Bulford Kiwi, on Bulford Hill near Stonehenge, was carved by New Zealand troops who were stationed there. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport has made it a scheduled monument on the advice of Historic England. Kiwi soldiers played a significant role in the Battle of Messines, fought in June 1917 in Belgium. Another monument at Cannock Chase in Staffordshire, marking the same battle, has also been granted protection. The Terrain Model of Messines - a scale model of the battlefield - was made by German prisoners of war using soil, concrete, bricks and pebbles. The model was a popular tourist attraction at the end of the war, but it became neglected and was lost until it was recently excavated. It has now been covered over again to protect it from damage and erosion. Roger Bowdler from Historic England said: \"These two monuments pay tribute to the bravery of New Zealand's fighting forces in the First World War and we are delighted that they are now being protected for the future. \"The Bulford Kiwi was cut into the chalk at the end of the war by Kiwi soldiers themselves, to mark the presence of their forces in England, and their achievements at the front. \"The taking of the Messines ridge was one of the war's most stirring attacks, and this model lay-out remains as testimony to the planning which made possible the victory. \"Like so much of our historic environment, these lasting reminders enable us to connect with lives and events from the past that made us who we are as a nation. \"One hundred years on, it is right to remember New Zealand's valour.\" Sir Jerry Mateparae, New Zealand High Commissioner to the UK said: \"It's fantastic to see Historic England protecting two very significant sites of huge importance for New Zealand. \"The special connections that were forged 100 years ago, with communities in the UK where New Zealanders trained, are still strong today and it's moving to see these sites protected for generations to come.\"",

    "Figures show that for those aged 65, men can expect to live for another 19 years and women a further 21 years. But there is concern that too many elderly people are living in poor health. And the figures vary across the country, with the North East and North West having lower life expectancies for 65-year-olds than other regions. Life expectancy among older age groups in England rose to its highest level in 2014 - with male life expectancy increasing by 0.3 years at age 65 and 0.2 years at ages 75, 85 and 95 since 2013. Female life expectancy increased by the same amounts at the same ages. This comes after a fall in life expectancy in some older age groups between 2011 and 2012. The only region where male and female life expectancy did not increase in 2014 was in the North East, where male life expectancy was higher in 2013. Among local authorities in England, the majority showed an increase or no change in life expectancy at age 65 - but one quarter showed a decrease. In the past, statistics have tended to focus on life expectancy at birth but now that most deaths in England occur in people over the age of 80, patterns of mortality in older age groups are becoming more important. Prof John Newton, chief knowledge officer at Public Health England, said the report presented a positive national picture that made achieving \"a good quality of life in later years even more important\". \"This report is an opportunity to remind people that, even during mid-life, it is not too late to improve your health,\" he said. \"Most of us could make changes today, like stopping smoking, being more active or eating better, that would allow us to look forward to healthier later years.\" He said it was not clear what had caused the variation in trends between local areas. Danny Dorling, professor of human geography at the University of Oxford, said there was an urgent need to find out why improvements had stalled in many parts of England in recent years. \"Beneath the headline figures of this report, there is evidence of worsening health for many older people in some parts of the country,\" he said. In Scotland, life expectancy continued to improve, with 65-year-old men expected to live for a further 17.4 years and women a further 19.7 years, according to the latest statistics. But there are also wide variations across the country.",

    "Glasgow City Council said it planned to put up the tax by 3% after the national council tax freeze ended this year. Council leader Frank McAveety said while the increase would raise more than £7m, the council faced a budget gap of £67m. Most councils have yet to confirm plans, with about a third indicating they may propose a 3% increase. Further details of Glasgow's budget proposals are expected later. Mr McAveety said: \"Raising Council Tax will support frontline services while protecting the most vulnerable in our city. \"One-in-four households will not pay a penny more - and we can avoid around £7m of the most difficult cuts, which would otherwise hit every community across the city.\" The average bill in the city - in the Band D category - is £1,213, compared to the national average of £1,149. All other bills are a set proportion of this figure. But changes this year mean those in bands E, F, G and H properties will automatically pay more - even before the 3% across-the-board rise is factored in. Increases are due to take effect just weeks before May's council elections. BBC Scotland's local government correspondent Jamie McIvor said: \"Inevitably, close attention will be paid to decisions taken by councils in the west of Scotland where the SNP is hoping to make big inroads into Labour's council powerbase. \"Privately, some Labour councillors believe they are caught between a rock and a hard place. \"They argue a rise in council tax would merely limit cuts rather than end them, so they would risk asking voters to 'pay more and get less'. \"However, they also believe that if they did not raise the council tax, they would be accused of failing to use the means at their disposal to at least attempt to mitigate cuts.\" Labour-run South Lanarkshire has said it plans to freeze bills this year but the leader of West Dunbartonshire Council has indicated a rise is likely. There have been no public declarations yet from Labour-run Inverclyde, Renfrewshire, East Renfrewshire, North Ayrshire, East Dunbartonshire and North Lanarkshire. The Scottish government has said more money would be available in the coming financial year for local services across Scotland.

    "Mr Besigye was the main challenger to President Yoweri Museveni in the country's recent general election, which Mr Museveni won by a landslide. He insists he was the rightful winner of the polls, but Uganda's top court upheld the official result. \"We have been informed by police today that Besigye appeared in court in Moroto and was charged with treason,\" said his lawyer Erias Lukwago. Mr Besigye was arrested on Wednesday in downtown Kampala and flown to Moroto, where he has been in custody ever since. It follows a series of arrests of the opposition leader during the election campaign. Meanwhile, Mr Museveni was sworn in on Thursday for his fifth elective term, extending his 30-year rule of Uganda. Foreign observers said the poll had been marred by fear and intimidation. In a BBC interview, Mr Museveni rejected allegations of vote rigging, and accused Mr Besigye of planning to incite violence. Responding to criticism from European Union observers that the electoral commission \"lacked independence and transparency\", Mr Museveni told the BBC's Zuhura Yunus that \"those Europeans are not serious\". \"Transparency is what we've been voting for,\" he added. Mr Museveni, a key ally of the West in the campaign against militant Islamists in the region, seized power in 1986 and is credited with restoring stability to Uganda.

    "Prosecutors accuse Fifa president Sepp Blatter of making a \"disloyal payment\" of $2m (Â£1.6m) to Mr Platini. Mr Platini has provided information to the investigation but said he did so as a witness. Both men deny any wrongdoing. Mr Platini has said he is still determined to run for Fifa president once Mr Blatter steps down. Asked whether criminal proceedings had been opened against him, Mr Platini said: \"Absolutely not. I was heard last week by the Swiss Authorities only as a person providing information and I cooperated fully.\" But this was contradicted by the Swiss attorney general, Michael Lauber, who said: \"We didn't interview Mr Platini as a witness, that's not true. We investigated against him in between as a witness and an accused person.\" Mr Lauber also said he was prepared to search the Uefa headquarters as part of the investigation. The allegations centre on a payment made to Mr Platini in 2011 at Fifa's expense for work he completed almost a decade earlier. It came just two months before Uefa gave its backing to Blatter's 2011 presidential campaign, leading some to question the timing of it. Mr Platini said he was told when starting the work that Fifa would not be able to pay him all the money because of its \"financial situation\". But Fifa accounts show a revenue surplus of around $83m (Â£55m) from 1999-2002, when Mr Platini undertook the work as a technical adviser. Fifa was thrown into turmoil this year when the US and Swiss authorities launched separate investigations into corruption at the body. Mr Blatter is also suspected of signing a contract that was \"unfavourable to Fifa\". He is due to stand down next year, but says he will carry on in the role despite the criminal proceedings.",

I'm buzzing.\" Higgins won all three sessions against Wilson, the world number 16, and believes his game has grown in strength over the course of the tournament. The Scot considers reigning champion Mark Selby as the favourite for the title, while his pre-competition tip was Hawkins. Yet Higgins is in a good place mentally as he prepares for the semi-final. \"The nerves get more difficult, but I'm more relaxed this year,\" he said. Media playback is not supported on this device \"I don't know if that's because I feel as if I'm playing OK. At this event, you need to have a few sessions when you have good, frame-winning breaks.

I feel as if my game can be there to do that but I'm sure other players will say the same thing. \"There are some sessions, especially this year, when I couldn't have played any better. I played [Ronnie] O'Sullivan in the final of the Champions and couldn't have played any better.

Mr Richard, a US citizen who lives in Islington, north London, says the sex was consensual and that he \"reasonably believed\" the girl was over 16. He gave a total of Â£480 to the teenager and her friend, which he says was for \"travel expenses\". Prosecutor Gino Connor told the jury how Mr Richard met the girl through a US website where he listed his profile as a \"sugar daddy\", while 13-year-old called herself a \"sugar baby\". During an iChat exchange retrieved from his laptop, the defendant asked her for a \"revealing\" photograph on her hands and knees. \"You are my new daddy I will do anything to keep you happy,\" the girl replied. They arranged to meet and Mr Richard made a payment of Â£120 through PayPal, the court heard. The girls travelled to Liverpool Street station on the morning of 2 January, where they met Mr Richard in a nearby cafe. He asked their ages and they told him they were 16 and 17, the court heard.

The 21-year-old looked comfortable in the semi-finals, producing a burst of speed down the back straight to move to the front of the pack and take the line two metres clear of her rivals. \"In 800m you need to be able to run a fast race, and you need to be able to win a tactical slow race,\" explained Mutola, who is in London to fine-tune Semenya's preparations. \"You [need to] combine those two things - so if the race is slow you can win anyway and if the race is fast then it's even better, [as in] the final they'll have to dip under two minutes. \"Since I've got here I've focused more on my athlete Caster Semenya as I know she has to do well, so I'm just enjoying being a coach for the first time.\" Semenya became global news when she was asked to take a gender test by athletics' governing body the International Association of Athletics Federations in the aftermath of winning her world title. Doubts were raised over her gender because of her muscular physique, running style and sudden improvement in times. Semenya was suspended for 11 months by the IAAF but was cleared to return to the track in July 2010. She won silver at last year's World Championships in Daegu despite a back problem.",
    "According to AP, the lawsuits accuse them of serious safety lapses. Rashad Charjuan Owens has been in jail on murder charges since March after four people died when his car broke through a barrier at the music, film and interactive festival. The crash, which happened outside the Mohawk venue, also injured 23 people. Among several wrongful deaths lawsuits was one from the family of Steven Craenmehr, a Dutch music executive, who was knocked off his bike. His widow and mother claim that SXSW organisers didn't put enough traffic safeguards on the roads for pedestrians during the event, which sees thousands of bands performing at venues across Austin. \"A festival organiser or traffic design consultant of ordinary intelligence would have anticipated the danger,\" the lawsuit says. Lawyers for SXSW released a statement which read: \"What happened on Red River was a terrible tragedy, caused by Rashad Owen's utter disregard of human life. \"Our hearts continue to ache for those injured and the families of those who lost their lives. \"We look forward to his prosecution for his awful crimes.\" Authorities say that Owens drove his grey Honda Civic through a barricade after an officer on a drink-drive patrol tried stopping the car. According to police, his blood alcohol level was .114, above Texas' legal driving limit of .08. In September, a SXSW safety report found that alcohol consumption and overcrowded venues during the event had left Austin facing a \"critical point where public safety could be compromised\" if changes are not made. Organisers called the report incomplete and said it failed to address root issues. SXSW is known as one of the world's best platforms for rising music talent.

It also plans to increase the ethylene capacity of its crackers at Grangemouth in Scotland and Rafnes in Norway. Both rely on fracked shale gas being shipped across to Europe from the US. Ethylene and propylene are key building blocks in the manufacture of plastics. In a statement, Ineos said its investment would boost the amount of ethylene it can produce at each plant in Grangemouth and Rafnes by about 50%, to more than one million tonnes.

    "His departure was said to be one recommendation of a report  by former US Attorney-General Eric Holder about the company's culture and practices. Uber said the board had voted unanimously to adopt all the report's recommendations. However, its contents will not be released until Tuesday. Mr Holder was asked to undertake the review in February after former Uber engineer Susan Fowler made claims of sexual harassment. The Financial Times reported that neither Uber nor Mr Michael would comment on whether he had resigned or been fired. James Cakmak, an analyst at Monness Crespi Hardt, said Mr Michael's departure reflected Uber's need for a \"fall guy\" and could help protect Mr Kalanick. \"If Kalanick did leave, we think it would be very difficult for him to come back,\" Mr Cakmak told Bloomberg. It is possible Mr Kalanick could be forced to take a leave of absence or have his role altered. That issue was on the agenda at a seven-hour board meeting held in Los Angeles on Sunday. Mr Kalanick has been on bereavement leave following the death of his mother in a boating accident. An Uber insider said the recommendations in Mr Holder's report include introducing more control on spending, human resources and other areas where executives led by Mr Kalanick have had an unusual degree of autonomy for a company of Uber's size. The San Francisco-based ride-hailing service has more than 12,000 employees. Mr Kalanick has earned a reputation as an abrasive leader and was criticised earlier this year after being caught on video berating an Uber driver. He said in response to the video: \"I must fundamentally change as a leader and grow up.\" Uber board member Arianna Huffington has said Mr Kalanick needed to change his leadership style from that of a \"scrappy entrepreneur\" to be more like a \"leader of a major global company\". One Uber investor said the board's decisions were a step in the right direction, giving the firm an \"opportunity to reboot\". Jan Dawson, an analyst with Jackdaw Research, said: \"This week we finally learn just how committed Travis Kalanick and the rest of the senior leadership team at Uber is  to meaningful cultural change.\" Last week Uber said it fired 20 staff after another law firm examined more than 200 cases including complaints about sexual harassment, discrimination and bullying. As part of its attempt to draw a line under its recent problems, Uber said it had appointed Wan Ling Martello, a Nestle executive and Alibaba board member, as an independent director. She is the third high-profile female appointment to the company in the past week. Uber, which is still privately owned with voting control resting with Mr Kalanick and his two board allies, is valued at about $68bn. Although revenues hit $6.5bn last year, it is yet to make a profit.",

The bridge had been blamed for nearly wrecking a nearby grade I-listed church during the January 2014 floods. Dorset County Council, which has worked with the Environment Agency on the project, said the replacement bridge would \"reflect the character\" of the existing bridge, and would use \"as many of the original bricks as possible\".

Officers asked him to provide a breath test and he gave an alcohol reading of 78mg - the legal limit is 22. At Glasgow Sheriff Court, McGregor was also fined Â£500. Sheriff Neil Mackinnon disqualified McGregor for 12 months, although he may get a reduction if he successfully completes a drink driving course. Last August, McGregor was banned from driving for four months and fined Â£400 after being caught driving at 69mph in a 50mph zone. The court opted to impose a four-month ban instead of a heavier penalty and left him with nine points on his licence. He was convicted at Hamilton Justice of the Peace Court after claiming the speed gun was faulty.

    "The Supreme Court's decision to uphold the death penalty of Pakistani national Mohammad Ajmal Amir Qasab, the sole surviving gunman of the 2008 attacks on Mumbai, has opened the debate once again. Predictably, the main opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has been quick to demand Qasab's swift execution \"as those who wage war against the country and kill innocents deserve no mercy\". Qasab can still appeal to the highest court to review the verdict; and his last hope lies with a plea for clemency to the president. His appalling crime of gunning down innocents surely qualifies as a \"rarest of the rare crime\", a condition for handing out the death penalty in India. But, as critics of capital punishment say, there's no evidence to show that the death penalty deters crime. Two-thirds of the world's countries have done away with the death penalty in law or in practice. Last year, according to Amnesty International, death sentences were imposed in 63 countries, but only 21 countries actually carried out executions. India has shied away from executing people for many years now. There have been only two hangings in the country in the past 12 years and the majority of convicts on death row can expect their sentences to be commuted to life. Former president Pratibha Patil commuted the death sentences of 35 convicts midway through her five-year term. Clemency pleas of 29 prisoners on death row in India are pending before the president. They include Afzal Guru, who was convicted for carrying out an attack on the Indian parliament in December 2001. The Supreme Court upheld his death sentence as long ago as 2004. Then there is a serious practical problem: there are only one or two hangmen available in India. Two years ago, I met one in a Calcutta prison who had been employed as a hangman-cum-sweeper, and was still waiting to carry out his first execution. Recently, 14 retired Indian judges wrote to the president asking him to commute the death sentences of 13 inmates being held in prisons across the country. And the Supreme Court itself recently admitted that some death penalties it had upheld were erroneous. \"Public opinion in India can no longer ignore the global movement in favour of abolition of the death penalty,\" says AP Shah, the former chief justice of the Delhi High Court in an interview in today's The Times of India.

    "An operation to pump 3,000 tonnes of water out of the Hoegh Osaka is expected to last until Sunday. But poor weather conditions has made it unsafe for the salvors to board on Saturday to finalise pumping arrangements. High winds of up to 83mph during the night caused the vessel to drag anchor for approximately 100 metres. The ship had been anchored to help control its movement. Salvage company Svitzer described working conditions on board as \"difficult\". The Hoegh Osaka has been secured two miles (3.2km) east of the Bramble Bank sandbank from which it freed itself on Wednesday. Water, described as being \"lightly contaminated with oil\" is being pumped from the ship's hold, which salvers say will cause the ship's 50-degree list to decrease. The film of oil on the water is believed to have come from vehicles held within the hold. With no power from the ship's generators, the water is being discharged using portable pumps during daylight hours. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) said there was no evidence of any pollution. Divers are also waiting until conditions improve to complete an inspection of the hull which began yesterday. The Queen's Harbour Master has introduced an exclusion zone of 984ft (300m) around the vessel, currently held by tugs between Cowes and Lee-on-Solent. Speaking at a press conference on Thursday, Hugh Shaw, the Secretary of State's representative for maritime salvage and intervention, said: \"I've got confidence the salvors can discharge the bulk of the water from sucking underneath the oil and that will leave us with a small quantity of oil on board the vessel.\" The 51,000-tonne vehicle transporter \"refloated\" itself unexpectedly at 14:00 GMT on Wednesday due to the high tide. It was towed two miles east of Bramble Bank, where it was grounded on Saturday. At a news conference on Tuesday, Bram Sperling of Svitzer, said there was some water inside because of a \"small opening in the vessel\" that had since been closed. A refloat was the preferred option to avoid further damage to the ship from the sandbank. Salvage experts boarded the ship on Monday and began carrying out an assessment to form a rescue plan. The Singapore-registered transporter set sail for Germany at about 20:20 on Saturday, shortly before being deliberately run aground by the crew after it unexpectedly started to list. There were 1,400 cars on board, including 1,200 Jaguar and Land Rover vehicles and 65 Minis, as well as 105 JCB machines and 500 tonnes of fuel. Two crew members out of 25 rescued by RNLI Lifeboats and the Solent Coastguard on Saturday suffered non-life threatening injuries.

The FBI has never named the security firm or group of hackers who helped unlock the phone, which was used by killer Syed Rizwan Farook.

In February, a court order demanded that Apple help unlock the phone, something which Apple resisted, saying it was unable to do so. It added that it hoped that the government would share with the company any vulnerabilities of the iPhone that might come to light. There was speculation that the FBI paid at least $1.3m (Â£1.05m) to break into the phone, based on calculations following comments by FBI director James Comey who said that the agency had paid more to get into the phone than he \"will make in the remaining seven years\" in his post.

    "This follows earlier warnings that the reef was experiencing its worst coral bleaching event on record. Prof Terry Hughes from the National Coral Bleaching Taskforce told the BBC the link between bleaching and global warming was \"very well established\". Rising water temperatures cause corals to drive out colour-giving algae. The corals can die if conditions do not return to normal. In pictures: Great Barrier Reef Vinegar could help save Barrier Reef The taskforce's survey shows that the extent of the damage is most severe in the northern section of the 2,300km (1,429 mile)-long reef, which lies off the coast of Queensland state. Only 7% of the reef showed no signs of bleaching, Prof Hughes said. The effects of El Nino, as well as climate change, are being blamed for the rise in sea temperatures that causes the bleaching. More than 900 individual reefs were surveyed using a light plane and a helicopter, with the accuracy of the aerial survey then checked by teams of scuba divers. \"I'm inherently an optimist, but I think we have a rapidly narrowing window of opportunity to save the Great Barrier Reef,\" Prof Hughes said. \"If we don't take action on global warming it will become more degraded. \"After three bleaching events the mix of coral species has already changed.\" This bleaching event is far more severe than previous bleaching events recorded in 2002 and 1998, he said. \"We know that this time only 7% of the reef didn't bleach. It was closer to 40% in the other two events. \"If these events start coming as frequently as every five to 10 years there will not be sufficient coral regeneration,\" he said. Tourism to the Great Barrier Reef generates $A5bn ($3.9b, Â£2.7bn) each year and employs around 70,000 people, the National Coral Bleaching Taskforce said. \"Thankfully many parts of the reef are still in excellent shape,\" said Daniel Gschwind, chief executive of the Queensland Tourism Industry Council in a statement. \"But we can't just ignore coral bleaching and hope for a swift recovery.\" The current worldwide bleaching event, which is also affecting reefs on Australia's north-west coast, is predicted to be the worst on record.

    "Greek coach Skafidas admitted nine rule violations, committed in 2011 and 2015. \"He was put into a position of trust, he abused that trust and as a result categorically destroyed a career,\" said Ukad chief executive Nicole Sapstead. Sprinter Wilson was banned for four years in 2011 after she tested positive for testosterone and clenbuterol. The 31-year-old tested positive for clomiphene in an out-of-competition test in February last year but her sanction was reduced to 10 months due to \"the substantial assistance\" she gave Ukad. A UK Athletics-licensed coach, Skafidas ran a training group for young athletes in Lincolnshire, but Ukad confirmed the nine violations all related to his conduct with Wilson.",
    "The Scottish capital's trams began running on Saturday, after six years of disruption and cost increases. Mr Salmond cited \"considerable public concern\" over the Â£776m project, which he said had disrupted homes and businesses in Edinburgh. The problems included a dispute between the city council and its contractor. The first minister stopped short of announcing a full public inquiry, raising concerns over the timescale, and instead decided on a \"non-statutory\" option. Speaking during first minister's questions in the Scottish Parliament, Mr Salmond said: \"I am sure that everyone in Edinburgh, and indeed all over Scotland, will be delighted to see that the Edinburgh trams are fully operational and carrying passengers. \"We cannot, however, lose sight of the considerable public concern over the conduct of the project, the disruption it has caused to households and businesses in the city of Edinburgh. \"I therefore recommended to the Cabinet, and it has been decided, to establish a judge-led public inquiry into the Edinburgh trams project to establish why the project occurred significant overruns in terms of cost and timing, requiring in particular a considerable reduction in the original scope.\" He added that the government had been assured by the City of Edinburgh Council that it would fully cooperate with the inquiry. The first minister added: \"There are lessons to be learned from the conduct of the Edinburgh trams project and I think the course of action we are proposing will be a substantial assistance in doing that.\" Mr Salmond was responding to a question from Marco Biagi, the SNP MSP for Edinburgh Central and an opponent of the city's trams, which run on an 8.7-mile route, from the New Town to Edinburgh Airport. \"All of us who opposed the trams project from the start as risky and over-engineered have been disappointed almost daily by being shown to be right,\" said Mr Biagi. \"Now that the trams are indeed rolling, if there is to be any faith from the public in future management or potential cost estimates for projects like this, we need to know for sure that these mistakes will never be repeated\". In the decade since the first money was allocated to the project, the price has doubled, the tram network has halved and it has taken twice as long to build as originally planned. Four years ago, a bitter dispute between Transport Edinburgh Limited, the arms-length company responsible for delivering the project, and main contractor Bilfinger Berger brought the whole project to a halt for months.",
    "A video was released via social media from MotoGP's Valencia Grand Prix, appearing to show the Italian colliding with the fan while riding a motorcycle. The nine-time world champion apologised for the incident and said that he hoped she was ok. Rossi, 37, added it was difficult for him to move quickly around the paddock. Fan Ana Cabanillas Vazquez told Spanish radio station COPE she would have accepted the apology if she thought it \"had been an accident\". \"Seeing the video, you can tell that it was done on purpose,\" she said. \"I have a small bruise on my leg.

    "A number of options are being considered to improve care in the north of the county, including removing consultant-led services from Whitehaven's West Cumberland Hospital. The boss of North Cumbria University Hospitals NHS Trust said it does not look like Whitehaven has the \"infrastructure\" to maintain services. Midwives have raised safety concerns. They have warned mothers and babies \"may die\" if consultant-led maternity services are removed from Whitehaven and concentrated at Carlisle Cumberland Infirmary. Trust chief executive Stephen Eames told BBC Cumbria: \"The options we are looking at are likely to mean there will be changes in maternity services and they're likely to mean we'll need to concentrate our expertise in our consultant staff in one place. \"Everybody involved would prefer a consultant-led service in both, but I think the reality is it isn't just about maternity, it's about the other clinical services that support it. \"So while we've made some improvements in children's services recruitment it doesn't look like we can recruit the infrastructure to support two independent consultant-led services.\" Midwives at Whitehaven are concerned mothers facing unexpected problems would need a potentially risky 40-mile (64km) transfer across the county. Earlier this month, Bernadette Bowness said: \"We're going to become a third world area because of our inaccessibility to a consultant-led unit. \"If ladies have to be transferred, mothers may die, babies may die. \"If babies have foetal distress, what with the transfer time they may end up brain damaged.\" A public consultation exercise will be launched next month to gauge opinion on the future direction of services provided by the trust. The organisation has been in special measures since 2014 after Care Quality Commission inspectors judged it to be failing to provide a sufficiently high level of care in a number of areas.",
    "Celtic have not lost a domestic game this season ahead of their Scottish Cup semi-final against Rangers. And Lovenkrands, 37, insists reaching the cup final in May should be all the motivation the Ibrox players need. \"I don't think it's anything to do with being the first team to beat them,\" the Dane said. \"With the Old Firm, you have to win. If you are playing for Rangers, you have to go and beat your rivals and Celtic will say the same. \"I don't think anybody would be looking at it from a Rangers point of view, that we want to be the first team to beat them this season. \"You need to approach every game to win it.\" Lovenkrands spent six years at Ibrox and scored twice, including a late winner, in the 3-2 Scottish Cup final win over Celtic at Hampden in 2002. He also scored the eventual winner in the 2-1 League Cup final defeat of Celtic at the national stadium the following year. And the former Newcastle United and Schalke player, who won 22 Denmark caps, would like to see a new Rangers hero emerge on Sunday. \"I would hope someone could come out and grab that chance,\" he explained. \"I grabbed my chance and these things happen in Old Firm games. It happens for Celtic players, like Henrik Larsson, he did fantastic scoring goals against Rangers. \"You get your chance and it is about grabbing it and hopefully someone will go and grab the headlines.\" Celtic, who have already won the Premiership title and the League Cup, are 33 points clear of Rangers in the league. The Ibrox outfit go into Sunday's match having won three games and drawn two under new manager Pedro Caixinha. \"Anything can happen in football,\" Lovenkrands added. \"I have always said it is 50-50 in an Old Firm game. \"Celtic have won the league comfortably and deservedly so. But Rangers have stepped up in the last couple of games. \"They have changed their manager and they have changed their way of playing. I like the way they have changed and the more direct approach suits the players better, they seem to be getting the results. \"But it is all about what happens on the day, a challenge after five minutes can change the whole run of the game.\"",

    "Sarah Sands, 32, killed her 77-year-old neighbour Michael Pleasted weeks after finding out he allegedly abused three boys, the Old Bailey was told. She told police that Mr Pleasted, who had been charged with sexual assaults on two children aged under 13, had been \"asking for trouble\". He was killed in his Canning Town flat on 28 November. Ms Sands denies murder. The court heard how Ms Sands armed herself with a knife after drinking two bottles of wine and a bottle of brandy. The case's prosecutor Jonathan Ree said CCTV footage showed she was in his block of flats for 20 minutes. Mr Pleasted, who was stabbed eight times, had been on bail awaiting trial. Police were also investigating an allegation he had abused a third boy. Ms Sands had befriended the pensioner who was a familiar local figure and ran a bric-a-brac shop from a Mace convenience store, the court heard. She used to visit him at his flat and bring him meals before she became aware of the abuse allegations. After the stabbing, Ms Sands went to the Isle of Dogs, putting the knife and clothes she had been wearing in a carrier bag. Before deciding to hand herself in, she told a family friend: \"I stabbed him\". During a police interview, she said she had tried to help him, while all the while he was abusing young children. She later said in a statement that she denied intending to kill Mr Pleasted or cause him serious bodily harm, claiming she went to confront him and took a knife for protection as she was scared. The trial continues.",
    "Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International released a report criticising conditions at a detention centre on the island of Nauru. The report concluded that Australia must intentionally allow abuse of detainees to deter asylum seekers. A statement from the Immigration Department criticised Amnesty for not consulting the government. \"There was no consultation with the Department of Immigration and Border Protection from Amnesty International in preparation of this report,\" the statement said. \"We strongly refute many of the allegations in the report and would encourage Amnesty International to contact the Department before airing allegations of this kind.\" The statement said Australia did not exert control over the laws of Nauru, a sovereign country. It said the Australian government welcomed independent scrutiny of its facilities. Australia transports asylum seekers who arrive by boat to off-shore processing centres in Nauru and Papua New Guinea. Read more: Why are asylum seekers so controversial in Australia? The Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch report was written after an incognito visit to Nauru last month. The organisations said Australia's actions seemed designed to discourage other migrants from attempting to get to Australia. No documentary evidence was provided in the report to support the claim. But interviews with 84 refugees and asylum seekers unearthed claims of rape and assault at the hand of Nauruan locals, inadequate medical care and cramped, uncomfortable living conditions. The detention centre at Nauru is run by a company called Broadspectrum and medical services are provided by International Health and Medical Services. Both companies have a contract with the Australian government. One woman quoted in the report said she had married a man 15 years her senior in order to feel safe on the island. Another said Nauruan men had driven her into the jungle with the intent of raping her. Although most held on the island have been identified as genuine refugees and released into the community, many felt afraid to leave their accommodations, particularly at night, the report said. The report also alleged that Nauruan police tended to downplay or ignore asylum seekers' reports of abuse.",
    "Assembly Tory leader Andrew RT Davies said although devolved, health was one of the main election issues for voters. \"Wherever you go across Wales people raise the issue of the NHS, and Labour are running the NHS in Wales,\" he said. Labour responded saying that Tory sums on the NHS \"simply don't add up\". Mr Davies said Welsh Conservatives would protect health spending and introduce a cancer drugs fund. He defended his party's decision to campaign on an area of policy that was not controlled in Wales by Westminster. \"(Labour leader) Ed Miliband has used the example of 'compare and contrast', and I think it is perfectly reasonable to point out we don't have a cancer drugs fund here in Wales and some of the most disappointing ambulance response times on record,\" he said. \"There is a real dilemma for voters in May. Do they want to vote for the Conservative party who want to protect health spending or do they endorse a party who have drastically cut health provision in Wales?\" But Welsh Labour's Deputy Health Minister Vaughan Gething accused the Conservatives of wanting to privatise the NHS. \"The Tories have had three opportunities in the campaign so far to rule out privatising the NHS and they have refused to do so\" he said. He added: \"This election is a clear choice between a Labour government that would invest in the NHS to train an extra 1000 doctors, nurses and front-line staff, or a Tory government that would introduce a tablet tax for sick people and privatise health services.\" Elsewhere on the campaign trail on Monday, Welsh Lib Dem leader Kirsty Williams was promising better rural health care while visiting target seats in mid Wales. Ms Williams said her party wanted to invest in cottage hospitals and community care. \"An urgent care centre in Montgomeryshire is essential if we are to relieve pressure on A&E departments and cut waiting times,\" she said. Plaid Cymru accused its rivals of neglecting the economy of north Wales.

    "Earlier this year, signs for the Clifton Village residents' parking zone appeared but some were fixed to railings which are Grade II* listed. It prompted complaints that the signs were spoiling a conservation area. The council said it used railings as much as possible to minimise posts in the pavement. It said it \"met regularly\" with English Heritage to talk about listed building work and legislation. The council said when signs were put up in the Kingsdown conservation area it was advised as long as it was not making \"significant or permanent changes to a building, which would alter its character, it was acceptable\". English Heritage's letter, seen by the BBC, raised the \"potential cumulative impact\" of the signs in West Mall and Caledonia Place, which contains listed buildings. \"We would suggest that taken together such work might fall within Section 7 of the [Planning and Listed Buildings and Conservation 1990] Act,\" it said. \"In our view, it would be prudent to seek a listed building consent... to allow for a careful consideration of the impact of the works on the special interest of the terrace, of the number of signs and the consideration of alternative locations.\" Numbers one to 31 Caledonia Place and their attached basement railings are Grade II* listed by English Heritage for their \"special architectural or historic interest\".",
    "Civil protection officials have already revealed that rescuers were let down by the Siresp emergency services network during the four-day disaster. Now details have emerged of pleas for help that did not get through to commanders on the ground. The government has ordered an investigation into the network. The fire began in the Pedrógão Grande area during the afternoon on 17 June and within hours the failures of the emergency network, which relies on mobile antennas, were becoming clear. The first failure came at 19:45 on 17 June. Three people dialled the 112 emergency number from an abandoned house in nearby Casalinho to report that the building was surrounded by flames. Emergency services tried to contact the local command post and the deputy commander but were unable to get through, according to a civil protection authority (ANPC) timeline, described by Portuguese media as a \"black box\". Five minutes later, officials were unable to contact a command post to help a father and son in trouble a few kilometres away in Troviscais. These and several other cases are documented throughout the night by the Público and Jornal de Notícias websites. At 01:02 on 18 June comes the most chilling entry on the civil protection authority's log, in a reference to the deaths of 47 people on a single stretch of the N-236 road. Thirty of the victims died in their cars. A district relief operations command appeals for help in tackling \"breakdowns in the Siresp network\" and for \"lifting the dead victims who are in the road, making it impossible for combat means to get through\". The civil protection authority has already confirmed \"failures in the Siresp network\" that continued throughout the four-day emergency and on the Saturday evening, firefighters resorted to using their old radio network. The government on Monday said it had asked for a study into Siresp's operation, particularly during serious accidents and disasters. Prime Minister Antonio Costa said last week that the network had suffered because cables and communication towers had been damaged by the fire. However, he said the mobile network had provided temporary mobile antennas. The forest fires were the worst in Portugal's history, with 64 dead and 254 injured. Portugal's Siresp (joint emergency and security network system) has had a chequered past. It was set up in 2006 as a partnership between the government and private sector. The system stopped working during a rescue attempt in storms in January 2013 and it was linked to the deaths of two firefighters a few months later.",

Blatter, 79, and vice-president Michel Platini have both been suspended for 90 days amid corruption allegations, which both men deny. Platini is seeking the next presidency, as is Prince Ali bin al-Hussein. Frenchman Platini, president of European football's governing body Uefa, submitted his candidacy papers earlier this month, but Fifa says it cannot recognise his candidacy while his ban is in place and he cannot campaign. However, Fifa's electoral committee says it may allow him to stand if his suspension ends before the election date. Shaikh Salman bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa of Bahrain is expected to contest the election. Former Trinidad and Tobago midfielder David Nakhid said he will stand, while ex-Tottenham defender Ramon Vega is considering doing likewise. South Korean Chung Mong-joon, another confirmed candidate, claimed his campaign has been \"sabotaged\" by a six-year ban from Fifa's ethics committee. On Tuesday, the 64-year-old's bid to lift the ban was rejected a Zurich district court. Swiss Blatter is under criminal investigation over claims he made a £1.35m payment to Platini in 2011, as well as allegations he signed a contract \"unfavourable\" to Fifa. Fifa's reform committee also made a number of recommendations for the governing body to make changes to \"improve efficiency, prevent fraud and conflicts of interest and increase transparency in the organisation\".

    "Announcing his decision, Dane County District Attorney Ishmael Ozanne said police officer Matt Kenny had been attacked and feared for his life. Nineteen-year-old Tony Robinson Jr, who was mixed race and unarmed, was shot on 6 March in a Madison apartment. His death sparked protests in the state capitol building, one of a series of US police shootings to raise tensions. More protesters with banners saying \"Black lives matter\" gathered in Madison after the attorney made his announcement on Tuesday. Mr Robinson's mother, Andrea Irwin, vowed to continue the \"fight\" as she addressed a crowd of supporters outside Grace Episcopal Church. Earlier, Mr Ozanne had said: \"This tragic and unfortunate death was the result of a lawful use of deadly police force and no charges should be brought against Kenny.\" Officer Kenny was responding to an emergency call about a man obstructing traffic who had allegedly been involved in an assault, when he confronted Robinson. On the night of the shooting, Robinson had various illicit drugs in his system, according to autopsy reports. His friends who made multiple 911 calls said he was \"acting crazy\" and tried to choke one of them. They said he attacked people on the sidewalk and was running in front of cars, Mr Ozanne said. Mr Kenny drew his firearm before entering the apartment building Robinson was in and he claims he was attacked by Robinson at the top of the stairs. He said he feared he would be knocked down the stairs and Robinson would take his gun, and he fired seven shots at him. But Mr Robinson's relatives, and many of the Wisconsin protesters, insist he is a victim of police brutality. \"My decision won't bring him back, it will not end the racial disparities that exist in justice system,\" said Mr Ozanne. \"It is not based on emotion, rather the facts as they have been investigated and reported to me, guided by the rule of law.\"",
    "The list of 198 firms owed a total of £466,219 in arrears and included football clubs, recruitment firms, care homes and hairdressers. Top of the list was a London restaurant which owed almost £100,000 to 30 employees. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said all the money owed had been paid back to workers. The list was the largest of its kind since the \"naming and shaming\" scheme was introduced in October 2013. The department said 688 employers in total have been publicly identified for flouting the law, with total arrears of more than £3.5m. Business Minister Margot James said: \"It is not acceptable that some employers fail to pay at least the minimum wage their workers are entitled to. \"So we'll continue to crack down on those who ignore the law, including by naming and shaming them.\" Restaurant San Lorenzo in Wimbledon, South West London, owed £99,541.98 to 30 workers, while Premier Recruitment Ltd in Derby owed £34,797.33 to 424 workers. Also on the list were football clubs Blackpool FC and Brighton and Hove Albion, which owed £2,861.64 to one worker. Brighton and Hove Albion said its reputation had been \"unfairly tarnished\" by its inclusion on the list, claiming the case was a \"minor administrative error\" which resulted from being \"over generous\" in paying expenses to someone on work experience two years ago. A spokesman for the club insisted: \"We are one of the few clubs who pays its staff over and above the National Living Wage.\" TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady called for the \"worst offenders\" to be prosecuted, adding: \"Bosses who try to duck the minimum wage must have nowhere to hide. \"The level of underpayment in some cases is truly eye-watering.\" The list comes after the new National Living Wage was introduced in April, requiring employers to pay at least £7.20 an hour to employees aged 25 and over. However, the Living Wage Foundation calculates that a rate of £8.25 per hour is required to meet the cost of living, rising to £9.40 in London. Some employers pay this higher living wage voluntarily. The National Living Wage of £6.70 an hour applies to workers aged 21 to 24, with lower rates for younger people and apprentices. The government's list includes firms that have failed to pay either the minimum wage or the National Living Wage. Conor D'Arcy from think tank the Resolution Foundation backed the government's policy of naming and shaming but added: \"With the number of people on the wage floor set to treble over the next four years, the government will need to strengthen its resources for enforcing both the national minimum wage and the national living wage.\" Green Party peer Baroness Jones said: \"The government must introduce a real Living Wage, calculated by the actual cost of living, as called for by the Living Wage Foundation and the Green Party, among others. \"This is the only way to ensure people can afford to live in Britain today.\"",

    "Thousands of the furry insects, with a wing span of up to 16cm (6in), interrupted a semi-finals match at the Darul Makmur Stadium last week. Over 800 sightings were also reported in neighbouring Singapore last month, sparking intense online debate. The Lyssa Zampa tropical moth, which is also known as the Laos brown butterfly, is native to South East Asia. Biology lecturer N Sivasothi said that while the moth sightings appear to be \"unprecedented\", it is not a new phenomenon. \"The moths are actually present during other times of the year but in very small numbers, so they are usually not noticed by people,\" Mr Sivasothi said, adding that the creatures typically emerge between April and August every year. Ecologist Anuj Jain said moths' use of light for navigation often causes them to head to built-up areas. \"Their tendency to emigrate in search of new uneaten host plants attracts these moths to light in urban city areas,\" he said. Experts said that while people suffering from asthma may be sensitive to hairs on their wings, the nocturnal creatures do not pose any threat. \"The moths are harmless and the public has nothing to be afraid of,\" said Lena Chan, Director of the National Biodiversity Centre at the National Parks Board in Singapore. \"There is no need for people to protect themselves against these moths as they do not cause any allergies or diseases. In fact, they are important pollinators and are beautiful to watch.\" Many Malaysians and Singaporeans however, took to the internet to share their moth encounters and to upload photographs of the winged creatures. Although many seemed to welcome the arrival of the furry insects, others remained cautious. \"In China, moths are viewed as symbols of death as they represent the souls of deceased loved ones,\" said Chinese astrologer Cindy Wu. \"It is therefore considered a serious taboo to kill moths or disturb them.\"",
    "This is according to a study revealing that 96% of the chicks are dying at two to three weeks old. Conservationists say that human activity has driven the birds to one remaining wetland, but that that site has insufficient food for the ducks. The research is published in the journal Bird Conservation International. The Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust (WWT), which led the research, estimates that only 25 individual birds now remain in the wild. Human activity, including deforestation, farming and fishing, has destroyed their habitat to the point that this last population is now restricted to one wetland in north-east Madagascar - a complex of lakes near Bemanevika. After the rediscovery of the species at this site in 2006, the WWT and its partners, including the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust and the Peregrine Fund, set up a conservation breeding programme and began to monitor the wild birds. Dr Geoff Hilton, head of species research at the WWT, said that with such a small number of birds, keeping a close eye on the population was straightforward. \"We had about 10 or 11 females, [and] we were able to tell that most of those females were laying eggs, and those eggs were hatching,\" he told BBC News. But at the point when the ducklings were two to three weeks old, they would start disappearing. Piecing the evidence together, including samples of food from the bottom of the lake, the researchers realised that the chicks were starving to death. These diving ducks feed from the bottom of lakes, and this steep crater lake was simply too deep for them. WWT senior research officer Dr Andrew Bamford, who led the study, said: \"The last refuge of the Madagascar pochard is one of the last unspoilt wetlands in the country, but it's simply not suited to its needs. \"Something similar happened in the UK when the lowland red kite became confined to upland Wales, and in Hawaii, where the last nenes survived only on the upper slopes of volcanoes because introduced predators had occupied their favoured grassland habitats.\" Dr Hilton added: \"What we think we're seeing is a bit of a classic wildlife conservation conundrum. \"The place where the species hangs on at the end is not a particularly good place for them - it's just the place that's been least badly affected by human activities.\" But the researchers say the species could thrive in Madagascar again if the captive-bred ducks can be found a new wetland home. \"We have been very successful in establishing a captive population,\" said Dr Hilton. \"And we have recently identified a lake that we think has potential to be restored and become a reintroduction site. \"The main thing we have to do is work with the local people to reintroduce and restore the pochard, but also to restore the lake and help people to get a better livelihood from the lake they live around.\" Follow Victoria on Twitter",
    "The new week-long round-robin competition aims to give more T20 tournament experience to the eight associate countries involved. Ireland's second game will be against Namibia in Abu Dhabi on 17 January before they face hosts the United Arab Emirates a day later in Dubai. The tournament's semi-finals and final will take place in Dubai on 20 January. Experienced internationals Boyd Rankin, Stuart Thompson and Andrew Balbirnie return to the Ireland squad for the tournament. Rankin (broken leg), Balbirnie (hip) and Thompson (performance anxiety) missed most of Ireland's 2016 campaign. Niall O'Brien has been left out of the squad with the Ireland selectors opting to take Gary Wilson as the only wicket-keeper while Middlesex seamer Tim Murtagh is also omitted. Jacob Mulder and Little retain their places in the T20 squad following their debuts in the format against Hong Kong, and Greg Thompson's impressive return in that game after an eight-year absence also sees him make the tour.

    "Hywel Dda University Health Board wants to reduce the hours of the paediatric ambulatory care unit (PACU) at Withybush Hospital by four hours a day. It is making a recommendation in response to there being \"fewer consultant paediatricians available.\" The plans will be discussed at a full health board meeting on 24 November. The PACU cares for children who experience sudden pain, high temperatures, sickness, infections, or requirements for dressings, blood tests, x-rays or scans. If the recommendation is accepted, it would mean the PACU would be open daily from 10:00 to 1800 GMT instead of 10:00 to 22:00. Sick children who require assessment after the new closing time would be referred or transferred by ambulance to Glangwili Hospital in Carmarthen. The health board said the move to reduce hours in the short term was the result of \"longstanding difficulties in recruiting paediatric consultants across the UK\". This coincided with the retirement of a Pembrokeshire paediatric consultant and the maternity leave of another. The health board said to do nothing would be a \"risk.\" There is also a recommendation to merge the on-call rota with the one operating in Carmarthenshire. This means that if there was a paediatric out-of-hours emergency at Withybush Hospital, the on-call paediatric consultants would offer remote advice. The health board's chief executive Steve Moore said: \"It is our duty to be realistic about the availability of our consultants and to plan care around this so that it is safe, consistent and to avoid public confusion. \"Otherwise, we risk the event of having insufficient staff and having to close the unit in an unplanned and uncoordinated way, risking patient safety and public confidence.\" He added that the health board's recruitment efforts are continuing.",

    "Mrs Foster said on Wednesday that she wanted to better understand those who love the language. She said she wanted to \"listen to and engage with those from the Gaelic Irish background, those without the party political background\". Mr Ó Muilleoir said he hoped the meeting would happen soon. \"It's a positive move,\" he said. \"Anything that encourages dialogue, that encourages conversations, that encourages increased understanding has to be positive.\" Stormont's parties have \"paused\" talks to strike a deal to form an executive until after Easter. The parties have yet to find a deal almost six weeks after the assembly election. One of Sinn Féin's key priorities in the talks is a guarantee that an Irish Language Act will be enacted. In February, Arlene Foster said the DUP would never agree to an Irish Language Act. But she has now said she would meet with \"people who genuinely love the Irish language and don't want to use it as a political weapon\". Mr Ó Muilleoir said he hoped she would listen carefully to the views of Irish speakers as they are \"united and firm on the need for an Irish Language Act\". \"I think that Arlene will find when she meets the Irish language community that they're a very broad church, people with all political views and none,\" he said. \"She'll find they're united behind the belief that Irish is a shared treasure of our people. \"It's a gift which I think Irish speakers want to share with everyone including, of course, those unionists who haven't yet completed the journey of understanding how important the Irish language is.\" He added that it is \"too early\" to judge where the DUP stands in relation to an Irish Language Act but that the meeting will \"be of benefit to her and to the Irish language community\".

    "The 32-year-old attacking midfielder has signed a two-year deal with Hull City after eight months Stateside. \"The national team weighed heavily on my mind,\" said Maloney. \"It was in March that I noticed that the travel back for the international games was proving more difficult than I thought it was going to be.\" The former Celtic, Aston Villa and Wigan player acknowledged \"it was proving difficult\" to be \"physically 100% able for training and matches\" as he looked to add to his 40 international caps. Maloney played in both of Scotland's matches in the spring, where he was subbed at half-time in the friendly against Northern Ireland and played the full 90 minutes of the 6-1 win over Gibraltar in Euro 2016 Group D qualifying. In June, he was back in Scotland for the friendly against Qatar and a few days later played a key role in Scotland's 1-1 draw in the Euro 2016 qualifier against the Republic of Ireland in Dublin. Earlier this week, he was named in the Scotland squad for next month's Euro qualifiers against Georgia in Tbilisi and Germany at Hampden. He said of his decision to leave Chicago: \"There were various reasons, a couple of them personal, but once I thought about it professionally, I still had a real desire to achieve something in British football. \"I have loved living in Chicago. I had a brilliant time. I don't think I've been happier living anywhere else. \"The football didn't work out they way we all hoped. The owner, the manager hoped for things to be different. \"I didn't want to give the national manager any excuse whenever I met up with the national team, travelling back from Chicago.\" Maloney did not speak to Scotland boss Gordon Strachan about his move to Hull, a Championship club he was keen to join with Steve Bruce as manager. He said: \"Once I made it known that I was going to come back, it was two or three weeks ago that Hull showed an interest in me. That's when a decision had to be made. \"My mind was made up pretty quickly that I wanted to play for him. Everything is geared up to get the team back into the Premier League.\" Scotland sit third behind Poland and Germany in Group D qualifying. \"We're in a good position,\" Maloney added. \"Let's hope that we're good enough to get the results needed to get us out the group and get us to a major championship.\"",

    "James Male, Andrew Bridge, Steve Warren and Paul Goslin died when Cheeki Rafiki, the yacht they were sailing, capsized in the North Atlantic. Prosecutors at Winchester Crown Court said yacht manager Douglas Innes failed to get it checked ahead of its trip. Mr Innes, of Stormforce Coaching, denies four counts of manslaughter by gross negligence. The 42-year-old, of Whitworth Crescent, Southampton, also denies a further charge of failing to ensure the vessel was operated in a safe manner. Prosecutor Nigel Lickley QC also outlined to the court how the yacht had been given a category 2 code, which meant it was only authorised to be used commercially up to 60 miles away from a \"safe haven\". The code certificate had expired shortly before the tragedy, he added. The men were returning from Antigua Sailing Week to Southampton when the vessel overturned in May 2014. The court heard that after receiving an urgent email from Andrew Bridge on board the yacht, Mr Innes, who was in a pub at the time, did not call the coastguard but instead went to another pub where Mr Bridge phoned saying the situation had worsened. Mr Innes returned home, called the coastguard and emailed the crew suggesting they check the bolts of the keel. Mr Lickley said it was a \"tragedy\" that they would eventually discover a number of bolts had failed or broken, causing the keel to detach from the yacht. He said: \"Some had failed and were broken and had been for some time,\" before the yacht left the UK in October 2013. Skipper Mr Bridge, 22, from Farnham in Surrey, Mr Male, 22, from Romsey, Hampshire, Mr Warren, 52, from Bridgwater in Somerset and Mr Goslin, 56, from West Camel in Somerset, died after the yacht lost its keel more than 700 miles from Nova Scotia in Canada. The yacht was found by a container ship on 17 May, two days after Mr Bridge's urgent email, with its life raft still on board. Mr Lickley told jurors the keel's loss would have caused a \"rapid capsize\" and the men on deck would have been \"jettisoned\" into the water while those inside would have been trapped. He added: \"What is clear from two of the emergency beacons used by Andrew Bridge and James Male is that they may have survived for some time, most probably in the water, that is until they were lost too.\" The US Coastguard was criticised for calling off its search after two days. However, following protests from family and friends, and intervention by the British government, it was restarted and the boat was discovered, the court heard. The trial continues.",
    "The 23-year-old signed from Atletico Madrid for a club record fee of £15m following Fernando's Llorente's move from Sevilla. Borja said: \"We can adapt and play with two strikers or just one, whatever the boss asks from us.\" The record signing will not play in Swansea's season opener at Burnley. Borja added on Llorente: \"We don't know each other personally but I've been told he's a really good guy. \"I'm sure we'll both work together well and do whatever's best for the team.\" Borja was born in Madrid and came through the academy at Atletico, but has spent the past five seasons on loan away from the Vicente Calderon. \"Of course there's a bit of frustration I didn't play much at Atletico,\" said Borja, who scored 18 goals last season in La Liga for Eibar. \"I grew up there, went through the ranks and wish I'd had more of an opportunity in the first team.\" Despite competition from La Liga and Premier League sides for the Spaniard's signature, Borja says his decision to join Swansea was not difficult. \"Swansea showed the most interest, they seemed to want me more than anyone else,\" he said. \"It's a great club who have a lot of confidence in their players and I really want to make a good impression here.\" Unlike 31-year-old Llorente, who was a part of his Spain's 2010 World Cup and Euro 2012-winning squads, Borja has yet to earn a senior call-up for his country. But he hopes to emulate ex-Swans striker Michu, who went on to earn a cap for his country after a prolific season with Swansea. \"Michu did a great job at Swansea which eventually earned him a place in Spain's squad,\" said Borja. \"If only I could score as many goals as he did, helping the team in every possible way, for the good of Swansea, but also to put myself in the frame for national selection too.\"",

    "The hashtag #penuriecarburantdansunfilm, which translates as \"fuel shortage in a film\", became France's top Twitter trend on Tuesday, with more than 5,000 tweets. A strike over new labour laws is now affecting all of France's eight oil refineries. An estimated 20% of petrol stations have either run dry or are low on supplies. In their posts, French social media users talk about films such as Total Recall, the title of both a 1990 and 2012 science fiction film. Total is also the name of a French multinational oil and gas company. Some users also changed film titles to reflect the shortage: Pulp Fiction was renamed Pump Friction, The Full Monty became The Fuel Monty and Mad Max: Fury Bicycle Lane replaced Mad Max: Fury Road. American actor Vin Diesel's surname and his Hollywood blockbusters attracted particular attention, with people inventing several titles for his Fast and Furious series: Last and Furious, Pas Fast Mais Furious (translation: Not Fast But Furious), Immobile and Furious and Fuel Furious. Others renamed 8 Mile, a semi-biographical drama staring US rapper Eminem, 0 Mile and 8 Miles a Pied (translation: 8 Miles on Foot). American director Stanley Kubrick appeared to inspire people who posted about Fuel Metal Jacket, referring to Kubrick's 1987 film Full Metal Jacket. 2001, l'Odyssee de l'espace is the French title of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. But Espace is also the name of minivan built by French car manufacturer Renault. Pictures of people filling jerrycans at petrol stations led people to incorporate the term into film titles. Tom and Jerrrycan, Jerrycan Beauty and Catch Me If You Jerrycan were the result. Another obvious target was Nicolas Winding Refn's 2011 film Drive which social media users changed to Walk and Drive Pas. Read more about France's controversial new labour laws",

    "Francee, the fortunate feline, was found and saved by Campbell Baird, who came to check on construction work at his new home. He only noticed the unfortunate cat after hearing \"meowing\" coming from the walls. \"I couldn't believe it at first,\" said Mr Baird. He used a drill, chisel and hammer to free Francee before posting a video of the unlikely cat rescue on Facebook in an effort to track down the owner. The video has since been shared more than 700 times and Francee has been reunited with her owner, a little shocked but uninjured from her ordeal. According to Mr Baird, the cat got stuck in a tiny cavity space after apparently clambering a ladder to the first floor. \"The only way in would have been from above so she must've climbed up and then got stuck down in between the wall. \"It's fortunate I came up to the house or the cat would not have been found. \"It was a small cavity space in the wall.

    "Shamsul Arefin brought four people from his native Bangladesh to work at the Stewart Hotel near Appin in Argyll over a three year period. His victims took out loans to pay him substantial sums for employment at the hotel. One was threatened with having his kidney removed by money lenders back home if he didn't pay his debt. Arefin's crimes were  described as a \"clear case of modern day slavery\". At Fort William Sheriff Court, he was found guilty of breaches of the Asylum and Immigration Act. He carried out the crimes between 2008 and 2010. He recruited his victims by offering them jobs as chefs at his hotel. They were told to pay him substantial sums of money which he described as a \"deposit\" in exchange for employment and a salary. On their arrival at the hotel, their wages were reduced to a fraction of the contracted amount and they were required to work far longer hours with their duties extended beyond the kitchen. The men told how they had to paint the hotel, clean rooms and cut and move logs in the hotel grounds in freezing winter temperatures. Arefin threatened his victims with termination of their employment when they complained and refused to return the money they had paid him. In one case the victim described how money lenders in Bangladesh had threatened to remove his kidney as a result of his inability to pay back what he owed. The crimes came to light following an investigation by the UK Border Agency and the then Northern Constabulary. Responding to Arefin's sentencing, Kath Harper, the Crown's national lead prosecutor for human trafficking, said: \"Arefin's greed had life-changing implications not just for his victims, but for their families and others who supported them. \"Human trafficking can come in many forms and as prosecutors we are committed to doing all we can do eradicate it from Scotland.\" Kevin Hyland, independent anti-slavery commissioner, added: \"The victims of these particular crimes endured exploitation and abuse many thought was a distant memory of the past. \"This is a clear case of 'modern day slavery' and I commend the bravery of the four men who gave evidence at the trial. I hope that receiving justice in the courts assists in their journey of recovery.\" Det Insp Richard Baird from Police Scotland said: \"Shamsul Arefin was driven by financial greed and held no regard for the working conditions of those in his employment. \"This was apparent by the poor condition that his victims were subject to through working long hours at no extra pay and often with substandard equipment and working supplies. \"In bringing this individual to justice we have disrupted, if not dismantled, one more illegal enterprise and hopefully saved other potential victims from inevitable suffering.\"",

    "The 14-time major champion, who has twice undergone surgery during 15 months out, is nine shots off the pace set by fellow American JB Holmes. Woods, 40, had four birdies in eight holes but he bogeyed the ninth after a wayward drive and poor chip. Another shot went on the 11th, while double bogeys on the 16th and 18th left the world number 898 a stroke over par. Woods said he \"felt pretty good\" and \"looking forward to the next few days\" after completing his round at the event he hosts to benefit his charitable foundation. \"I hit the ball in three bushes and the water, so it could have been something really good,\" he said on Sky Sports. \"I got off to a solid start but then I made a few mistakes. I didn't play the par fives particularly well. \"I had some awkward shots.  If you drive great you can take advantage of this golf course, but if you don't you can end up in bushes or rocks and go sideways.\" His first double bogey came after he pulled his approach to the green from the centre of the 16th fairway and was forced to chip out short of the green. He over-hit his fourth and two putted from the back edge for a six. Woods then pulled his drive on the par-four 18th into a lake and although he hit the pin with his fourth shot, he two-putted from 12 feet for the fourth six of his round. He had briefly tied for the lead at four under after a run of three birdies from the sixth hole as he played the first nine holes in three-under-par 33. And although he cancelled out his bogey on the 11th with a birdie on the 15th, his two late double bogeys blotted an otherwise encouraging round. Holmes leads the 18-man event after an eight-under-par 64 that featured seven birdies and an eagle. Japan's Hideki Matsuyama is a shot further back on seven under, with US Open winner Dustin Johnson on six under.

    "Its leader, Heinz Christian Strache, said the way postal votes were handled was among numerous irregularities. \"We are not sore losers,\" he said. \"This is about protecting the foundations of democracy.\" The party's candidate was defeated by the former Green Party leader by just under 31,000 votes. The filing of the challenge was confirmed by Christian Neuwirth, a spokesman for Austria's constitutional court. The court now has four weeks to respond. If it takes the full four weeks, its findings will come just two days before the poll winner, Alexander Van der Bellen, is due to be sworn in. Is Europe lurching to the far right? Europe's nationalist surge, country by country Is populism a threat to Europe's economies? The presidency is a largely ceremonial post, but a victory for the Freedom Party could have been a springboard for success in the next parliamentary elections, scheduled for 2018. Correspondents say the legal challenge threatens to renew divisions created by the vote, which split Austria and exposed, once again, deep differences in Europe over how to deal with the migrant crisis, the economy and how to balance national interests against those of the EU. Mr Van der Bellen was declared the winner of the election the day after voting, with 50.3% of the vote against Mr Hofer's 49.7% - despite preliminary results placing the Freedom Party's Norbert Hofer slightly ahead. But the Freedom Party is alleging numerous irregularities in its 150-page submission to the constitutional court. Mr Strache says he has filed evidence that postal ballots were illegally handled in 94 of 117 district election offices, reports said, suggesting that more than 570,000 ballots could have been affected by this. The party also claims it has evidence that under-16s and foreigners were allowed to vote. \"The extent of irregularities is more than terrifying. That's why I feel obliged to challenge the result,\" Mr Strache told a news conference. \"You don't have to be a conspiracy theorist to have a bad gut feeling about this whole election. Without these irregularities Mr Hofer could have become president.\" The BBC's Bethany Bell in Vienna says that if the constitutional court accepts the evidence presented by Mr Strache, there could be several possible outcomes, including a partial recount or a fresh vote in affected areas. But the court will have to decide whether the law was broken and whether any possible breaches would have affected the outcome of the election.",
    "The report suggested splitting the current role, as both head of the legal system and president of the States. Political expert Dr Adrian Lee said the dual role was unique to the islands. He said they were the only democratic jurisdictions in the world where the person judging a case had been involved in making the law. The Carswell Committee, which authored the report, suggested Jersey's Bailiff should step down as president of the States of Jersey and be replaced by an elected speaker. Lord Carswell said: \"There are various international constitutional documents, which rather frown on the idea of judges having anything to do with the legislator.\" He said there was also a practical reason, as in recent years the Jersey Bailiff had had to spend increasing amounts of time on States work. Dr Lee, a former professor of politics at Plymouth University, said: \"The Carswell Committee also made the point that as the two islands increasingly develop their international personalities, as they're called, it's important that their legal systems and political systems are clear to the outside world. \"At the moment there is some lack of clarity over who is speaking on behalf of, who's representing the island - is it the chief minister, the Lieutenant Governor, the Bailiff or is it all three?\" A spokesperson for Guernsey's Policy Council said it would watch the developments in Jersey with interest. Guernsey States Assembly and Constitution Committee said it intended to discuss the report at a meeting next week.

    "The official ONA news agency said they were flown on Wednesday out of Yemen's capital, Sanaa, which is controlled by the Houthi rebel movement. The US government had requested Oman's help in finding them, it added. The ministry gave no details on the Americans' identities, but one Yemeni security official told the Reuters news agency had been held by the rebels. \"The three Americans were detained by the security forces run by the Houthis and were held on suspicion of spying,\" the official said by telephone from Sanaa. Earlier this month, the US state department said an American contractor for the United Nations who was detained at Sanaa's airport last month had died. John Hamen and a colleague - reportedly also American - were held as they arrived on a UN aircraft from Djibouti. In September, two Americans held hostage for months by the Houthis were freed and flown to safety in Oman, along with a British citizen and three Saudis.

Oman, which is not part of the coalition, has played an active role in efforts to negotiate an end to the conflict. The fighting has left at least 5,700 people dead, about half of them civilians, since the end of March, the UN says.",
    "It has been waiting on a review of the Russian Proton rocket, which failed on its last outing in May while carrying a Mexican payload. Inmarsat's third Global Xpress platform was due to be the next passenger and was grounded as a consequence. The launch on the Proton is now set for 28 August from Baikonur, Kazakhstan. Lift-off will be at 17:44 local time (12:44 BST). Inmarsat is the world's largest mobile satellite services operator. Its principal customer base is the shipping sector, but the company also caters for any groups that need telecommunications away from a fixed line. These include oil and gas installations, the aviation sector, armed forces, aid agencies and NGOs in disaster areas, and TV news crews reporting from trouble zones. Its new £1bn GX network is the biggest commercial UK space project in the process of being rolled out right now. It is designed to incorporate three spacecraft distributed around the globe to give worldwide coverage. Two have already gone up, to relay telecommunications from Asia all the way across to the Americas. The upcoming launch should complete the network over the Pacific, and give customers seamless coverage wherever they are - something that is especially important to the shipping and aviation sectors. Investigators are now confident they understand the loss of May's Proton. The natural vibration in the rocket's third stage loosened bolts that held a turbopump in place for a steering engine. The disruption ultimately broke an oxidizer line and led to the pump shutting down, and the loss of the engine. Measures have been put in place to make sure this cannot happen again. The Proton has had a torrid record of late. Six vehicles and their payloads have been lost in the past five years, and Inmarsat's GX network is roughly a year behind schedule because of all the problems the rocket system has experienced. \"The return to flight is typically the best flight to be on because there is extra caution, extra controls,\" Michele Franci, Inmarsat's Chief Technical Officer, told BBC News. The new satellite is insured, but the company has taken the additional precaution of ordering a fourth platform from manufacturer Boeing. This would be available in mid-2016 should anything go wrong this month. Global Xpress sees Inmarsat take its first, firm step into Ka frequencies to deliver communications. Traditionally, its spacecraft have worked in the L-band. The higher frequency of Ka allows faster throughput connections, giving the new satellites broadband speeds that are 100 times faster than the company's previous generation of spacecraft. \"If there has been any benefit from the delay, it's that it has allowed us to fix network issues that we would have had anyway in this period,\" said Mr Franci \"So, once we go really live at the end of the year, the network will be more stable and more reliable. But we could definitely have done without the delays, that's for sure.\" Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos",
    "One person was injured in the crash on Saturday night, which happened during heavy rain near the national stadium. Police said in a statement on Monday that both drivers were in their 20s and unemployed. The statement prompted many questions online about how they came to be driving the cars. \"What are their names? Who are their fathers?\" one user on the Weibo microblog site asked, according to AFP. \"Socialism is so good that it allows unemployed people to drive supercars,\" joked another. Photos which emerged on Monday showed the lime green Lamborghini with its front section almost entirely torn off. The red Ferrari appeared to have lost a door, and was bashed along on its side and rear. The tunnel itself was also damaged, with a section of the wall torn off and guardrails mangled. Workers could be seen clearing up debris strewn across the road. The cause of the crash is not clear, but police are investigating. Witnesses told local media that the tunnel was often used for drag racing. It was widely observed online that the crash coincided with both the Grand Prix being hosted in Shanghai and the premiere of the latest Fast and Furious film, a franchise full of fast cars and high-value write-offs.",

    "Developers claim the 100MW project at Glenmuckloch, near Kirckconnel, could generate power for more than a century. It is the latest in a series of renewable energy schemes planned for the site, which is owned by Buccleuch Estates. They are part of a project to redevelop the opencast mine as Glenmuckloch Energy Park. The details have emerged in a scoping report for the pumped storage hydro scheme submitted to Dumfries and Galloway Council. Buccleuch Estates has joined with mining company Hargreaves and 2020 Renewables to draw up the plans. It will involve creating two reservoirs - one higher than the other - which will be connected by a tunnel with a pump-turbine. The report states: \"When excess electricity exists within the grid the pump-turbines go into pumping mode lifting water to the upper pond and when demand within the network exceeds available supply the pump-turbines reverse and change to generating mode with water released from the upper pond.\" If the project goes ahead, the lower reservoir will be created from the existing opencast void, while a second, upper pond will be excavated at the head of Halfmerk Hill. The higher reservoir will have a water depth of 22m (72 feet), creating 3.3million cubic metres of water storage. The redevelopment of Glenmuckloch follows the collapse of surface mining firm Aardvark TMC in 2013, leaving a shortfall in the money needed to restore the site to its pre-opencast condition. However since then Buccleuch Estates and Hargreaves have worked to implement a rolling programme of restoration in parallel with coaling operations. Later this summer two community wind turbines will be built to the west of the hydro site. Earlier this year plans for an eight turbine wind farm next to the mine were submitted to Dumfries and Galloway Council.",
    "East Sussex Healthcare Trust which runs the Conquest Hospital in Hastings and Eastbourne District General Hospital is currently rated as \"inadequate\". However, BBC South East Today has learned the trust has failed to improve and is likely to be placed into special measures at a meeting on Friday. The trust said it was awaiting a report to be published and would not comment. The other trusts currently in special measures include East Kent Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and Medway NHS Foundation Trust. Medway's Maritime Hospital was forced to turn away ambulances earlier, and on Wednesday, to help ease the burden on its A&E department. The East Sussex trust was rated as \"inadequate\" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) in March, after failing to meeting government targets. In May, it was criticised by Eastbourne Borough Council, which passed a vote of no confidence in its management. And in July the chief executive resigned while the trust had to apologise after patients' details were found in the street. Leadership would appear to be the big problem at this trust. In its March report, the CQC described a \"disconnect between the trust board and it's staff\" and a \"culture where staff were afraid to speak out\". The trust's problems have been well documented but what has apparently been lacking is any real progress in putting things right. It's my understanding the CQC feel very little has improved in the last few months. Friday's meeting between all the stakeholders will be a chance to discuss the way forward but many people I have spoken to in the wider NHS believe special measures will be imposed on the trust. A spokesman for the trust refused to comment on whether it would be put into special measures. He said: \"We are waiting for the publication of the CQC report next week and until it is published and they have made any recommendation we are unable to make any further comment.\"",
    "Lisa Doughty, who has mesothelioma, was a pupil at Haggerston Girls' School in Hackney, east London in the 1980s. The 47-year-old said the music desks were often covered in dust, which may have had asbestos particles. Hackney Council said it had not received a formal claim and could not investigate until it did. Ms Doughty said she had spent a lot of time in the music room each week rehearsing plays. \"We used to sit on the desks and have to wipe white dust off them,\" she said. \"There were two heavy doors at the entrance to the music room and these would constantly slam, shaking the room. The school was in pretty bad repair so maybe the dust came down from the ceiling when the door closed.\" Ms Doughty said if it was proved the music room was the cause of her cancer, then it was \"possible that many others have been affected\". \"I wanted to raise awareness of this and to appeal for anyone else who has been affected, pupils or teachers, to get in touch.\" Ms Doughty's lawyers, Slater and Gordon, have found that asbestos ceiling tiles were in place during the time that she was a pupil at the school. They are considering taken further legal action. A Hackney Council spokesman said: \"Asbestos was historically used extensively in both public and private buildings due to its fire retardant properties and, as with any building of this age, Haggerston School has been subject to regular condition and asbestos surveys and removals.\" Edmund Young, an asbestos-related disease specialist at the law firm, said: \"Mesothelioma is traditionally a form of cancer that has affected those working in industrial jobs, but we are seeing more and more people - both teachers and former pupils - coming to us who have breathed in asbestos particles while at school.\"",

    "The area near the main administrative block of JNU is filled with passionate students. They cheer loudly as a speaker climbs on to a stage. Slogans like \"free Kanhaiya Kumar\" and \"long live revolution\" fill the air as hundreds of visibly agitated students pour into the area. Those gathered here believe that Mr Kumar, the leader of the university's student union, is innocent of the sedition charges levelled against him, and are shocked by the fact that police entered the university to arrest him on Saturday. Police have alleged he organised an event commemorating the hanging of 2001 Parliament attacks convict Afzal Guru, where \"anti-India slogans\" were raised. The students here passionately defend Mr Kumar when I ask them what actually happened at the event. \"We are not terrorists. We are just students and we also condemn anti-India slogans. Our president had nothing to do with those slogans at the event,\" a student tells me. But she refuses to speak on camera. \"I don't want to be seen on camera. I am worried about my safety,\" she says. Student activist Shreya Ghosh speaks of the fear prevailing inside the university. \"We have been sleeping in different rooms every night to avoid arrest,\" she says. Another student activist Deepshita claims that ideological politics lies at the heart of Mr Kumar's arrest. \"Right-wing students want to increase their foothold in the university and that is why they got him [Mr Kumar] arrested. They feel bolstered because the right-wing BJP party is in power at the centre,\" she says. Professor Rajarshi Dasgupta agrees. It's 3pm and speakers are becoming more ferocious in their attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his BJP party. Among the speakers is Prof Ajith Kanna. \"If Kanhaiya is anti-national, then I am also anti-national,\" he tells the cheering crowd. But he pleads with his students to remain peaceful and not pay attention to rumours. And rumours are not in short supply, flying across the tension filled campus. Among them are that more than 100 armed right-wing activists have entered the campus. I meet right-wing student group Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) member Saurabh Kumar a few blocks away from the protest site. \"The law will decide whether he [Kanhaiya Kumar] is guilty or not but we won't tolerate anti-India activities inside this campus,\" he says. But not everyone is protesting. At one of the student housing facilities, I meet PhD students Bibas Sewa and Bijay Thapa. The two condemn the arrest of Mr Kumar, but agree that the protests have disrupted their studies. Even at a time when politics has gripped JNU, there are some students who just want to get on with their work.",

    "One is the US Grand Prix in Austin, Texas; the other is Singapore. Each one has that certain je ne sais quoi that lifts them out of the humdrum and makes them exceptional. As far as Singapore goes, it's no surprise it has become second only to Monaco as the place where most business gets done over a grand prix weekend. It's a place you just really want to go. That message permeates, and has made it into one of the most desirable races on the calendar. For a start, the ambience is terrific - and, let's be honest, this is what appeals to the business visitors, rather than the demands of racing on one of the longest tracks in F1 in crippling humidity. Singapore is a fascinating destination full stop, thanks to its place at the crossroads of south-east Asia and colonial past. But hosting the race at night adds an extra dimension. The track jags through the city centre under lights, Chinese lanterns adding a dash of colour, the futuristic city skyline the backdrop. As the sun sets, the whole place seems to shimmer and sparkle for a while. Darkness takes the edge off the tropical heat, and a heady, luscious tropical atmosphere settles over the place. For those working at the race, there's a surreal edge to it, too. Know someone who volunteers in sport and deserves recognition for their efforts? Give them the chance to shine by nominating them. First track sessions at dusk, qualifying and race after dark means staying on European time. So you wake up at 2pm, finish work in the early hours and go to bed at six in the morning. You can eat in a hotel restaurant, some of which stay open all night for the race weekend. Better, though, to head to an all-night hawkers' market, where delicious, cheap local food is on offer from a myriad of stalls and you can drink in the atmosphere of the place. Oh, and the track is pretty good, too. It's no Spa or Suzuka, but the Marina Bay Circuit has a challenge all of its own. A long, long lap, a nearly two-hour race, bumps, 23 corners and intense humidity make it arguably the toughest grand prix on the calendar - only Malaysia comes close. Add it all up and it's a race not to be missed. Andrew Benson, chief F1 writer Subscribe to the BBC Sport newsletter to get our pick of news, features and video sent to your inbox.",

    "The victory represented a gain from the SNP, who took the seat in the 2011 Holyrood election. The by-election was caused by the resignation of sitting MSP Bill Walker, who was thrown out of the SNP and jailed for domestic abuse. Cara Hilton, the parliament's newest MSP, said the people of Dunfermline \"deserved better\". The SNP won Dunfermline as part of its landslide election win in 2011 with a majority of just 590 votes, but was not able to hold on. In the end, Labour took the seat with a majority of 2,873 - a 7% swing from the SNP. The Liberal Democrats came third in the contest, with the Conservatives in fourth place. Ms Hilton said: \"After the disgrace of Bill Walker, Dunfermline deserves better and I will ensure that we will be better - far better than what went before.\" Labour majority: 2,873 Turnout 24,200 - 42.65% Swing: 6.94% from SNP to Labour And ahead of the SNP administration's independence referendum next year, she added: \"We need a Scottish government that will address the needs of Scots, not one  that will simply make promises about what will happen after 2016. \"Today Dunfermline has sent a message to Bute House and Alex Salmond: it's time for you to focus on the real priorities of Scots, not your constitutional obsession.\" The by-election campaign centred on contentious local issues, including proposed school closures, while the SNP focused on its national policies such as the council tax freeze and the decision to remove the tolls on the nearby Forth Road Bridge. Despite the result, SNP candidate Shirley-Anne Somerville said she was proud of the campaign she fought. \"We've run a positive campaign trying to support local parents in their schools and I hope we can come together, all of us in the party, to make sure those three schools in the Dunfermline constituency stay open,\" she said. The Liberal Democrats saw their vote drop by 8% on the night. Candidate Susan Leslie said: \"I think it has been a victory for women in politics in Scotland that four women stood in this by-election and fought positive campaigns on the issues for Dunfermline.\" Scottish Conservative candidate James Reekie - whose party saw a 1% increase in its vote - added: \"When the people of Dunfermline are faced with the dilemma of Labour and the SNP, they chose the Conservatives.\" Turnout in the by-election was 42.65%.",

    "The force's interest in using the birds of prey follows trials in the Netherlands. Drones - pilot-less aircraft which are controlled remotely - are used by police forces to capture footage on difficult terrain, including cliffs. But there are concerns criminals are also using the new technology. In November, the Ministry of Justice said a drone used to smuggle mobile phones, SIM cards and drugs into the grounds of HMP Manchester had been recovered by guards. The MoJ reported nine attempts to use drones to infiltrate prisons in England and Wales in the first five months of 2015. A think tank has also warned that drones could be used by terrorist groups. The UK Air Proximity Board said last month that drones had been involved in four serious near misses at UK airports. The birds would help by taking down the aircraft, which they would consider to be prey. However, Jemima Parry-Jones, who is the director of the International Centre of Birds of Prey in Gloucestershire, described the idea as a \"gimmick\". \"Eagles are big, powerful birds; they should not be flown in built-up areas. And secondly in terms of the safety of the bird, you're asking it to grab hold of a drone, which often have four rotating blades keeping it in the air,\" she said. \"If the police in the UK are asking the right experts they should listen to our advice. \"If you don't believe us, try putting your own fingers into the propeller of a reasonably sized drone and see what happens.\" But a spokesman for the RSPCA said: \"In principle we would not have an issue with police forces training eagles in an attempt to tackle drones, although we would have concerns over the welfare of the birds. \"At the moment, however, there is not enough information available for us to be able to make an informed comment.\" A Met Police spokesman said: \"As would be expected in an organisation that is transforming, we take an interest in all innovative new ideas and will of course be looking at the work of the Dutch police use of eagles.\"",

Now, the farming of the shellfish has taken off, secured the highest quality rating and are due to be sold locally. Roger Hall, from the Porlock Futures Community Interest Company, said it had been a \"brilliantly successful trial\". Using oysters from Morecambe Bay in Lancashire, trials were set up to establish whether the shellfish could be farmed in the seas around Porlock. \"We've proved the oysters not only grow but have got the best Class A classification for cleanliness you can get,\" said Mr Hall. \"It's the realisation of what started off as an interesting idea and now we've got 70 trestles with thousands of oysters on them all waiting to be eaten in the restaurants.\" Following a successful trial, the project has been awarded Â£75,000 from the Power To Change fund and raised more than Â£65,000 from the local community.

    "Capped 94 times, Phillips' comments come as criticism has been levelled at coach Rob Howley for failing to bring new players into the Wales team. As they prepare to face France, Wales have capped just three new players since the 2015 World Cup, but Phillips says he understands the situation. \"You can't just blood youngsters because they are young,\" he said. Since 2015, only Blues flanker Ellis Jenkins, Newport Gwent Dragons lock Cory Hill and Ospreys fly-half Sam Davies have been handed their senior debuts. In Wales' final Six Nations clash in Paris, there have been calls for Howley to have one eye on the future and play new faces. Instead the has stuck with the same side that beat Ireland last time out. This comes despite Howley having a host of uncapped players in his squad in the shape of Ospreys flanker Olly Cracknell and lock Rory Thornton, Leicester fly-half Owen Williams, Scarlets wing Steffan Evans, Dragons wing Ashton Hewitt, Scarlets scrum-half Aled Davies and Wasps flanker Thomas Young. Media playback is not supported on this device Howley has also ignored calls for Davies to start at fly-half and for Ospreys' teenager Keelan Giles to come in on the wing. Phillips said he agreed with Howley's decision and that he believed the onus was on the young players to show they are ready for the senior side. \"There's a few guys on the verge, but those youngsters have still got to learn,\" Phillips told BBC Radio Wales. \"They are young and developing, but they will get their time in seasons to come. But they've got to improve in training and show Rob that they deserve to be first-choice players.\" Against France, Phillips believes Howley has got his selection spot on. He added: \"It's a difficult one. In that international jersey should be the best because you are the best in the position. You should not just hand out caps willy-nilly to people. \"The development of the future is an important thing, but that needs to be done in a structured way. \"But it has been difficult because of the way things have panned out.

    "The Dudley Business Loan Fund is aimed at businesses in the borough with fewer than 250 staff that have struggled to secure bank loans. The scheme is a partnership between Dudley Council and the Black Country Reinvestment Society (BCRS). Councillor Shaukat Ali said he believed it could play a \"vital role\" in stimulating the local economy. He said there were some 9,000 businesses in the area that could be eligible. The scheme, offering loans of £10,000 to £50,000, is open to small and medium-sized businesses with a turnover of less than £5m.

    "Transgender protesters forced a halt to debate on the bill on Wednesday. Last month, the state approved a human rights measure banning gender identity discrimination at public facilities. In recent weeks, two other states passed laws ensuring equal access to gender-segregated facilities for transgender students. The bill in Arizona's Republican-dominated legislature would make it a misdemeanour offence to use a public toilet, bathroom, shower, bath, dressing room or changing room associated with a gender other than what is on one's birth certificate. Penalties could include six months in prison. \"If you look like a man and you live your life like a man, you should be able to use a man's bathroom,\" said Dru Levasseur, a transgender rights lawyer for the advocacy group Lambda Legal. But John Kavanagh, the Republican lawmaker who sponsored the bill, said he feared criminals might take advantage of the situation and expose themselves to children of the opposite gender. \"This law simply restores the law of society: men are men and women are women,\" Mr Kavanagh said, according to the Associated Press. \"For a handful of people to make everyone else uncomfortable just makes no sense.\" But, Mr Kavanagh added, police would be allowed to use their discretion over whether to press charges if women used the men's room to avoid a long queue. On Wednesday, Mr Kavanagh agreed to postpone a vote on the bill at the start of a hearing filled with dozens of transgender activists. The bill's opponents say it would force transgender people to reveal themselves and risk harassment, \"Most transgender people try to slip through public places without being noticed,'' activist Erica Keppler said. \"This will turn us into criminals.\" And advocates say transgender people can find it difficult to change gender on their birth certificates because many states require proof of gender treatment surgery. Meanwhile, other states such as Idaho and Ohio do not allow such changes at all, the American Civil Liberties Union said. It is already illegal to discriminate against transgender people in 16 US states, although the extent of protections can vary, the group added. In an ongoing case, a Colorado family has filed a complaint against the state after their six-year-old, who was born a boy, was banned from using the girl's bathroom at her primary school.",

A Lancashire Police spokesperson said: \"We have checked CCTV and spoken to the club and inquiries continue. \"We have had no formal complaint from Mr Marquez.\" After the attack, Marquez tweeted: \"Thanks for all your kind messages and support about Blackpool. \"It was a bad experience but I'm feeling better and just want to look forward to the show on Saturday!\" Mr Marquez made his Strictly debut in this year's series and had been partnering EastEnders actress Tameka Empson, who plays Kim Fox in the BBC soap. They were eliminated in the second round but Marquez has continued to appear in the programme as part of the weekly group routines.",
    "The children at Newington Church of England Primary School in Sittingbourne were aged between four and 11 and received the news in Friday assembly. The scenario had not been discussed with parents or senior staff first, the school admitted. It said the exercise was part of a week of learning about refugees. In a statement, the school said: \"We intended to provide a scenario that would enable the children to empathise with those we were raising money for. \"In future all activities of this nature will be discussed with a member of the senior leadership team prior to being undertaken. \"Only options that allow the children to empathise and understand without causing them unnecessary stress and anxiety will be considered and approved.\" The school said the message could have been delivered in \"a more appropriate manner\" and has apologised to parents and children. It had been taking part in Christian Aid's refugee week. Charity Christian Aid, for whom the school has fundraised, said: \"We have very little information about what pupils were actually told in the assembly, but we would never recommend any teaching approaches that put undue stress on children.\"",
    "The 67-year-old suffered a broken collarbone when he was knocked to the ground outside his Gateshead home in January. An online appeal set up by beautician Katie Cutler raised £330,135. Richard Gatiss, 25, from Gateshead, had pleaded guilty to assault with intent to rob at Newcastle Crown Court. After the sentencing, Mr Barnes said it was \"just about the right length of time\" and he hoped prison would give Gatiss time to reflect on what he had done. \"I hope while he's in prison he'll do some thinking and when he comes out he'll do something useful,\" he said. Gatiss, from Split Crow Road, was caught after police retrieved DNA evidence from a pocket on Mr Barnes' jacket. He had been desperate for money to buy legal highs but ran off empty-handed when Mr Barnes shouted for help, the court heard. Judge Paul Sloan QC described Gatiss' actions as \"despicable and opportunistic\" and said he had picked on Mr Barnes because he was vulnerable. Mr Barnes has lived with disabilities from birth after his mother contracted German measles when she was pregnant. He is visually impaired and stands 4ft 6in (1.21m) tall. After the hearing, Mr Barnes, who was joined by 21-year-old Miss Cutler, said: \"I'm pleased he's been sentenced and I think the sentence of four years is just about the right length. \"I hope while he's in prison he'll do some thinking and when he comes out he'll do something useful. Maybe he might decide to help people, which I think would be a good idea for him. \"It's sad that he was brought to the stage of doing something like this - not necessarily just me, it could have been anybody and they might not have got over the incident. \"But I've moved on,\" he said. Holding back tears, Miss Cutler added: \"It's hard for me to talk about Richard as it wasn't me who was attacked, but I just hope he gets the help that he deserves. \"I'm just glad that that some good has come from this and we can move forward.\" While on remand, Gatiss was kept in segregation for his own safety. Jamie Adams, defending, said it was \"an awful case\" but publicity surrounding it made it difficult to \"keep a proper outlook on what the sentence should be\". On the prison bus to court Gatiss had been \"the subject of some pretty awful double-standard behaviour\" from other inmates, Mr Adams said. \"Life is not easy for him. He is going to be in the public glare for a long time to come and he knows that.\" His father, Karl Gatiss, refused to comment on the sentence outside court but called for legal highs to be banned. Northumbria Police said the sentencing \"should send a message out to those criminals who think it is acceptable to target the vulnerable\".",
    "In the first half of August, 3,800 migrants arrived in the province of Quebec seeking asylum. Most are Haitians who fear they will be deported if they stay in the US. Government officials are now redoubling efforts to counteract misinformation helping bring them to Canada's doorstep. Nearly 60,000 Haitians were offered temporary protection in the US after a devastating earthquake in Haiti in 2010. The Trump administration extended that temporary protection until January 2018. Canada completely lifted its own protected status for Haitians a year ago. In 2016, about 50% of all asylum claims by Haitians was rejected. On Monday, federal Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale warned that \"people should not think that border-hopping is a desirable or productive thing to do\". Canadian diplomatic staff in the US  have been trying to \"aggressively dispel the myths\" about coming to Canada circulating south of the border, including that residency is guaranteed, said Immigration Minister Ahmed Hussen. Federal Liberal MP Emmanuel Dubourg, who is of Haitian origin and speaks Creole, has been tasked with engaging extensively with Haitian media in American cities like Miami and New York. End of Twitter post  by @CitImmCanada Over the weekend, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also addressed the issue. \"Canada is an opening and welcoming society,\" he told journalists at a news conference in Montreal on Sunday. \"But let me be clear. We are also a country of laws. Entering Canada irregularly is not an advantage. There are rigorous immigration and customs rules that will be followed. Make no mistake.\" Mr Trudeau has been criticised over his government's refugee-friendly message and \"irresponsible tweets\" by opposition politicians who argue that those  helped encouraged the surge. Canadian officials are also trying to counteract the spread of misinformation online about the openness of Canada's asylum system. Since January, 7,500 migrants have crossed illegally into Canada. The majority are crossing into Quebec, where migrant numbers more than tripled between June and July to 2,996 from 781. In the first half of August, 3,800 migrants crossed seeking asylum in the province. The federal government has increased the number of staff in the region in order to help process claims that determine whether a migrant is eligible to make a refugee claim. There is currently a five-month wait.",
    "A University College London team spoke to paediatricians at 177 hospitals in England and Wales and found poor knowledge on identifying underweight children and serious complications. This was despite most respondents having experience of treating a child with an eating disorder. The Royal College of Paediatrics said it was working to improve training. Study leader Dr Lee Hudson from the Institute of Child Health, University College London, said more under-13s now presented with eating disorders than meningitis due to the success of vaccination programmes. This shift in childhood illness may be one reason why his research suggested a lack of knowledge on spotting underweight children and the associated medical problems, he added. In the study, one on-call paediatrician was questioned in every hospital providing acute in-patient care for children. During a phone interview they were asked how they would identify if a child was underweight and what clinical examinations they would carry out to check for severe or potentially life-threatening complications. Only half said they would use Body Mass Index to decide if older children or adolescents were underweight, as advised in international guidelines. And only one in five said they would adjust that for appropriate cut-offs in children. There was also a lack of awareness of signs and symptoms of complications in children whose weight had dropped to seriously low levels. The researchers were particularly concerned that only 13% knew a specific danger sign to look for in tests checking that the heart was working properly, the team reported in Archives of Diseases in Childhood. Doctors also scored poorly on knowledge of dangerous complications associated with giving nutrition to someone who has not eaten for a while or is severely malnourished. Dr Hudson said this was not a criticism of doctors because eating disorders tended to present with vague symptoms, but highlighted a gap in training. \"In addition to that, services for children with eating disorders are very hit and miss around the country.\" But he stressed that as those surveyed would be the first paediatricians to assess such children, especially out of hours, they needed to know how to spot dangerously underweight children and teenagers and signs of severe complications. \"From previous research we know that a third of children who are underweight present with life-threatening features,\" he added. Prof Russell Viner, a co-author of the study but also a member of the Royal College of Paediatrics Nutrition Committee, said the college was aware there was a training need around eating disorders and underweight issues. \"We are refreshing training on adolescent health,\" he said. \"And in association with the Department of Health and the Royal College of Psychiatry we are developing a training programme around mental health in adolescents.\"",
    "Couples will now be allowed to have two children, it said, citing a statement from the Communist Party. The controversial policy was introduced nationally in 1979, to slow the population growth rate. It is estimated to have prevented about 400 million births. However concerns at China's ageing population led to pressure for change. Couples who violated the one-child policy faced a variety of punishments, from fines and the loss of employment to forced abortions. Over time, the policy has been relaxed in some provinces, as demographers and sociologists raised concerns about rising social costs and falling worker numbers. The decision to allow families to have two children was designed \"to improve the balanced development of population'' and to deal with an aging population, according to the statement from the Community Party's Central Committee carried by the official Xinhua News Agency (in Chinese) on Thursday. Currently about 30% of China's population is over the age of 50. The total population of the country is around 1.36 billion. The Communist Party began formally relaxing national rules two years ago, allowing couples in which at least one of the pair is an only child to have a second child. China's one-child policy What was China's one-child policy? Trauma and sympathy shared online Correspondents say that despite the relaxation of the rules, many couples may opt to only have one child, as one-child families have become the social norm. Critics say that even a two-child policy will not boost the birth rate enough, the BBC's John Sudworth reports. And for those women who want more than two children, nor will it end the state's insistence on the right to control their fertility, he adds. \"As long as the quotas and system of surveillance remains, women still do not enjoy reproductive rights,\" Maya Wang of Human Rights Watch told AFP. I was born in 1979, the year the one-child policy was implemented. And even then, I wasn't supposed to be born. In my parents' work unit, there were also quotas for babies. By the time my mother announced her pregnancy, the quotas were all used up for the year. But kind-hearted officials decided to look the other way and allowed my birth. My would-be siblings were less lucky. As a result of the policy, my mother had to endure two abortions. Even today, she talks about 'Number Two' and 'Number Three' and what they might have been like. Read more personal stories Carrie Gracie: U-turn may not bring prosperity Writing in The Conversation, Stuart Gietel-Basten, associate professor of social policy at the University of Oxford, says the reform with do little to change China's population and is instead a \"pragmatic response to an unpopular policy that made no sense\". The announcement in China came on the final day of a summit of the Communist Party's policy-making Central Committee, known as the fifth plenum. The party also announced growth targets and its next five year plan.",
    "The 33-year-old, the world's number one ranked Test bowler, is set to miss Lancashire's next two County Championship games. England begin their four-match series against Pakistan at Lord's on 14 July. Anderson suffered a stress fracture in the right shoulder blade during the third Test against Sri Lanka. Paceman Anderson played a key role in the recent Test series against Sri Lanka, which the hosts won 2-0. England's leading wicket-taker in Tests took 21 wickets across the three matches, including 10 as the hosts won the opener at Headingley by an innings and 88 runs. He replaced team-mate Stuart Broad at the top of the International Cricket Council bowling rankings after taking 8-94 in the second match of the series. The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) said Anderson's availability for the Pakistan Test would be \"determined following ongoing management and review by both the ECB and Lancashire's medical teams\". Anderson missed the last two Tests of England's 2015 Ashes win with a side strain, before a calf problem forced him to sit out the first Test against South Africa in December. A short statement from Lancashire read: \"The club wishes James well with his recovery and hopes to see him back in action soon.\" Durham all-rounder Ben Stokes could replace Anderson after returning to competitive action on Friday after injuring a knee during the Sri Lanka series.",

    "British Gas unveiled a 5.1% price reduction, followed swiftly by EDF's announcement of a 5% cut. British Gas's price change takes effect on 16 March, while EDF's kicks in eight days later. The moves benefit customers on a standard domestic gas tariff. Britain's big six energy suppliers have been under pressure to pass on savings to customers after a 57% drop in wholesale gas prices since this time last year. E.On was the first to announce a cut this year of 5.1%, followed by similar reductions by SSE, Scottish Power and Npower. Executive director at consumer group Which?, Richard Lloyd, said :\"Seeing all of the big suppliers mirror each other with small cuts in the face of falling wholesale prices will raise questions in many people's minds about whether competition is working in this market.\" British Gas, which is owned by Centrica, said 6.8 million of its customers on dual-fuel deals would see an average annual saving of Â£31 due to the 5.1% cut. It said customers on so-called \"fix and fall\" tariffs would also benefit from the price reduction. EDF said about 900,000 of its customers would also make an annual saving of Â£31. It said it had no exit fees on any of its fixed deals. Beatrice Bigois, managing director of customers at EDF, said: \"Our prices are under constant review and today's announcement reflects falls in wholesale gas costs.\" Centrica's Mark Hodges, chief executive of its energy supply and services in UK and Ireland, said: \"Competitive pricing is the way to retain existing customers and win new business in this hard-fought market.\" Some commentators warn that these types of \"standard\" tariffs are among the most expensive, so there is still benefit in shopping around. Rachel Fletcher, Ofgem's senior partner for consumers and competition, said: \"These price cuts are a movement in the right direction for loyal customers, but they are dwarfed by the savings available by switching from a standard tariff to a fixed deal. \"You could save more money, up to Â£300, by switching.\" There was also criticism of the industry for failing to cut electricity tariffs, despite falling wholesale costs. Energy analysts at Jefferies said: \"There has still been no movement in electricity tariffs, despite a 30% fall in wholesale electricity prices since August 2014. \"This is likely due to increased environmental costs, which fall on electricity rather than gas, and additional network charges.\" British Gas said it was unable to lower electricity prices due to rising costs, such as for network delivery, adding that wholesale costs only make up a third of electricity bills. Energy and Climate Change Secretary Amber Rudd said there was still more to do. Suppliers are awaiting the outcome of a competition watchdog investigation set to conclude in June, which Ms Rudd said would help determine if consumers were getting a \"rough deal\".",

    "Resuming on 33-1, Machan (81) and Wells put on 134 for the second-wicket before Machan was bowled by Ravi Patel (4-42). Wells fell to Patel shortly after for 61, but Yardy's innings of 70 at Lord's helped the visitors up to 300 all out - a first innings lead of 66. At stumps, Middlesex were 47-0, with Sam Robson racing to 41 not out, trailing by 19 runs. A worn-looking pitch made Machan's fine knock all the more impressive, with Yardy and Wells taking a more workmanlike approach to their innings. Patel was not introduced to the Middlesex bowling attacking until 150 runs were on the board but in just his second over he removed Machan, going on to add Wells, Chris Nash and Ben Brown. Just as the home side were threatening to take control at 216-6, a Sussex fight back began, with Ashar Zaidi putting on 38 with Yardy, followed by a useful 40 from Yardy and Ollie Robinson.

The current leader points to a surge in party membership under his stewardship as evidence that he is building a \"mass movement\" capable of winning a general election, with his allies saying the Tories are \"in retreat\". But Mr Smith said: \"I think that's delusional, and I think Jeremy needs to think a bit more about that straight, honest politics that he started his campaign with.\" He said: \"The straight, honest truth is that we are right now at our lowest ebb in the polls, ever. \"If there was an election tomorrow Labour would be decimated, and that's got to be a shock to Labour's system.\" He said Mr Corbyn was \"misleading himself if he thinks we are heading towards an election victory\". If Labour continued on its current \"disastrous trajectory\", Mr Smith said, it would be left with as little as 140 MPs. It currently has 230, with the Conservatives on 329. \"If Jeremy is deluding himself that we are heading to victory I do not think the rest of the party or the country can afford to be deluded about where we are,\" he said, claiming Labour was \"in the doldrums\" and that it faced \"Groundhog Day\" if Mr Corbyn won.

    "The US central bank said it had unanimously agreed to keep rates at close to zero this month, but believed the economy was on a stronger footing. \"Economic activity has been expanding moderately in recent months,\" it said in a statement. But it still did not give a clear indication of when rates would rise. In its statement, the Fed noted that the job market, housing and consumer spending had all improved. The central bank's policy makers also said they expected inflation to rise gradually toward its 2% target. On employment - which is now at a seven-year low of 5.3% - the bank said job gains had been \"solid\", more  positive language than last month. But it again reiterated that it would only hike its benchmark interest rate \"when it has seen some further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective\". The Fed's decision to keep its main interest rate on hold this month had been widely expected. \"The bottom line is they didn't do a lot. \"But they've nudged the market in the direction of a 2015 rate hike. And it's increased our confidence in a September rate hike,\" Millan Mulraine, deputy head of US strategy at TD Securities told the BBC. Barclays economist Michael Gapen said that he also still expected a rate rise in September, which he said remained the bank's \"baseline forecast\" And Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Funds, said the statement confirmed the Fed was \"taking baby steps\" towards an increase. The interest rate has now been at a record low for six and a half years. The US central bank's decision to cut the rate to such a low level in December 2008 was aimed at boosting growth in the economy amid the global financial crisis. Most analysts expect the first hike in September, but Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen has emphasised that any increase will be determined by the latest economic data. She has also said that when rates do begin to rise, the increase will only be gradual. US stock markets, which were up ahead of the Fed's decision, continued to trade higher after the decision.",

Labour's Roberta Blackman-Woods was the only other candidate who stood in the election. Details of the number of votes each candidate got will be published later. As no other Conservative candidate put their name forward, Mrs Laing was automatically chosen as first deputy chair of ways and means. Deputy speakers, who stand in for Mr Bercow in the main Commons chamber and have a range of other duties, were elected for the first time in 2010.",
    "Complaints about data collection by GCHQ, MI5 and MI6 were put forward by campaign group Privacy International. The ruling said some data collection did not comply with the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). But it added that proper statutory supervision was put in place last year. It was a \"highly significant judgement\", Privacy International said. As part of its review of the spy agencies' activities, the IPT examined the organisations' collection of communications data - involving the \"who, where, when, how and with whom\" was involved in conversations, but not their contents - and personal information about people. Such data is \"vital for identifying and developing intelligence targets\", according to GCHQ. Article 8 of the ECHR states, however, that all citizens have the right to a private life and that any interference with personal data must be lawful and necessary. \"It is very significant,\" said Graham Smith of London law firm Bird & Bird. He added that much of the data collection had been carried out under an older piece of law - section 94 of the Telecommunications Act 1984. \"It gave absolutely no clue at all that it could be used for this particular purpose,\" said Mr Smith. \"Everyone accepts that what the agencies do operationally has to be secret, but the laws that say what they can and can't do shouldn't be secret.\" An official policy about how such data collection should be carried out lawfully came into force in February 2015 - this was put into practice by the intelligence agencies later the same year. It included guidance as to how collected data should be acquired, managed and destroyed The tribunal found that, prior to this, personal datasets compiled by spy agencies did not comply with Article 8 and were therefore \"unlawful\". \"The powers available to the security and intelligence agencies play a vital role in protecting the UK and its citizens,\" said the Home Office in a statement. \"We are therefore pleased the tribunal has confirmed the current lawfulness of the existing bulk communications data and bulk personal dataset regimes.\" It added that the government was \"committed\" to providing greater transparency and stronger safeguards for bulk data collection powers available to intelligence agencies.",
    "Another five soldiers were wounded in a rocket attack on Turkish tanks, the military said in a statement. The fatalities are believed to be the first since Turkey launched its operation inside Syria two weeks ago. Two fighters from the Free Syrian Army were also killed and another two injured in the attack. \"Two of our hero comrades were martyred and five were wounded in a rocket attack on two of our tanks by Daesh (IS) elements,\" the army statement said. The rocket attack was launched near the village of al-Waqf, it added. Syrian rebels backed by Turkey say they have recaptured a number of villages from IS since the Turkish operation - code-named Euphrates Shield - began. The rebels have also retaken the key border town of Jarabulus. On Sunday, Turkey said IS fighters were pushed out of their last positions along the Turkish-Syrian border. Turkish forces have targeted IS inside Syria, but have also attacked Kurdish fighters in the same region. The pursuit of the Kurdish YPG militia has led to criticism by Washington, which regards the Kurds as one of the most effective forces in the battle against IS.",

    "The 20-year-old Frenchman joined Celtic from Fulham in the summer, with his 32-goal haul ensuring he is now one of Europe's most sought-after strikers. And Rodgers insists Dembele has benefited massively from making the switch to Scotland's top-flight. \"He's developed very well and met the challenge to play for a big club, feel pressure and win trophies,\" he said. \"He wants to improve and that's the type of player you want to work with.\" Dembele cost Celtic a development fee of just £500,000 but his value has rocketed after a stunning debut season. Rodgers concedes that the striker will leave the club one day but expects a lot more from him before that time comes. \"I think we all know at some point he will move on, it's just about timing,\" Rodgers told BBC Sport. \"But I know at this point he's very happy here. He's only 20 and he's been a joy to work with. \"There's no doubt there will be a natural point in time that he goes, I think we all understand that. Unfortunately, that's how it goes up here. But if he serves the club well in his time here that's all we can ask for.\" Media playback is not supported on this device Celtic will win the Premiership title if they beat Hearts at Tynecastle on Sunday. They are unbeaten in the league this season, have already won the League Cup and are in the semi-final of the Scottish Cup.

The last five are against top six teams so it becomes really difficult. \"In terms of the treble, we never really mention it. We have to stabilise that emotion and just think about performing and playing well. \"We want to win every game we play.

    "Terry Smith, 33, died in hospital in November 2013, a day after being held in Surrey under the Mental Health Act. He had been taken to Staines police station and kept in restraints. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) has referred the case to the Crown Prosecution Service. The IPCC said two sergeants, one of whom had retired, and a health worker contracted to Surrey Police could face charges of gross negligence manslaughter and misconduct in public office. It had investigated eight police officers and two staff,  the methods used to detain Mr Smith and why he was kept under restraint at the police station. Police arrested Terry Smith, a father who lived locally, in Stanwell at about 22:00 GMT on 12 November 2013 after a call for assistance from an ambulance crew. He fell ill and was taken to St Peter's hospital in Chertsey, where he died the following day. IPCC Commissioner Jennifer Izekor said:  \"We have now completed our investigation into the events leading up to Mr Smith's death. \"I have decided to refer the case to the CPS to determine whether any criminal charges should be brought against any officer. \"My thoughts remain with everyone affected by Mr Smith's death.\"",
    "The hotel chain said the investment programme would bring 150 jobs and 10 apprenticeships. Two of the new hotels, located off the Royal Mile on New Market Street, will open at the end of this month. The third, which will be in York Place in the New Town, is scheduled to open in late spring. The new sites will take the total number of Premier Inn hotels in the city to 14, with more than 1,500 rooms. One of the two hotels on the Royal Mile will be a hi-tech \"hub by Premier Inn\", the chain's first in Scotland. The hub will allow guests to control their room settings using an Apple Watch. Additional investment by Premier Inn in the city includes a £1.8m extension at Premier Inn Newcraighall and a £1.2m refurbishment at Edinburgh Central. Simon Ewins, chief operating officer for Premier Inn and hub, said: \"We are absolutely delighted to be opening three new fantastic hotels in Edinburgh and it is great that we are able to bring so many jobs and apprenticeships to the city. \"Hub is a new concept for us which we are really excited about, especially as this is the first one in Scotland and outside of London. \"We are confident our guests visiting the beautiful city of Edinburgh will enjoy this new digital experience and we will look to open more in Scotland in the future.\"",
    "Courts such as Stirling, Kilmarnock and Dundee were jailing nearly 20% of women appearing before them, compared to 7% in Edinburgh and 5% in Airdrie. The judiciary said it was not appropriate for an active sheriff to be interviewed for the programme, but retired sheriff Peter Gillam gave the view from the bench. He served as a sheriff from 1991 until 2013, and said the variations reflected the independence of the judiciary. He said: \"Obviously there is now, as I understand it, a board set up for advising on sentence to the judiciary. \"But every judge is his own person or her own person, and they all have different ways of dealing with things, they all have different views and they are all independent. \"There has to be a certain degree of uniformity and that is undoubtedly enforced by the existence of an Appeal Court so anyone who does something which is particularly outrageous, as far as what is perceived to be the appropriate way of dealing with people, that can be corrected. \"But variety is the spice of life and I think that it would be wrong to try to dragoon the judiciary into dealing with things which they believe to be the correct way of dealing with things. \"They have local knowledge, they know the person, they have full information and they deal with it to the best of their ability and you have to trust that person to deal with it in that particular way.\"",
    "The 25-year-old batsman died from a haemorrhage in the brain two days after being hit on the neck during a match in Sydney on 25 November 2014. The five-day hearing was convened to examine if his death was avoidable. Some players giving testimony at the inquest have been accused of dishonesty for saying they could not recall many of the events of the day. The inquest, which began on Monday at New South Wales Coroner's Court, heard evidence from players including Brad Haddin, Doug Bollinger and David Warner. The court examined whether Hughes, batting for South Australia in a Sheffield Shield game against New South Wales, had been targeted by short-pitch bowling, or had received unsettling comments from opponents. Questions were also raised about whether a bowler told Hughes \"I'm going to kill you\" before he was fatally injured. Hughes' parents walked out of the inquest as the counsel representing the family, Greg Melick SC, criticised the players for repeatedly answering many questions by saying \"no recollection\" or \"I can't recall\". \"At the end of the day, there was a plan, there was sledging, and short-pitched balls were bowled at Phillip Hughes, which increased the risk of an injury,\" Mr Melick said. \"Nine consecutive short-pitched balls from the one bowler aimed at leg stump or the body of the batsman was going too far.\" Suggestions of fabricated evidence were denied by the counsel representing Cricket Australia and its players. Hughes' brother and sister later exited the inquest as the sworn statements from the players were defended. The counsel assisting the coroner, Kristina Stern SC, said concerns about sledging and short balls were \"unnecessary\" and should not form part of the findings. NSW State Coroner Michael Barnes will deliver his finding from the inquest on 4 November. A previous report, commissioned by Cricket Australia, said protective helmets should be compulsory for batsman facing fast- and medium-paced bowling. But it said helmets meeting the newest safety standards would not have saved Hughes' life.",
    "The 19 were freed following mediation by South Sudan's government, it adds. This is the first group to be released since about 125 children were abducted in the cross-border raid. Members of the Murle community carried out the attack. They have previously been accused of stealing livestock and children to raise as their own. More than 200 people from the rival Nuer community in Ethiopia's western Gambella province were killed in the 15 April raid. Ethiopian forces crossed into South Sudan, encircling villages where the children were held. However, the children were freed without any fighting after South Sudanese officials entered into negotiations with the abductors, the Ethiopian News Agency reports. Negotiations would continue to free all the children, it reports. \"The children must be rescued and be reunited with their families. The cattle that was taken should also be handed over to the right owners,\" South Sudan's ambassador to Ethiopia, James Pitia Morgan, is quoted as saying. Ethiopia shares a long border with South Sudan and cross-border raids involving the Murle and Nuer communities are not uncommon. However, the scale of the 15 April shocked many people in both countries, and led to protests in Ethiopia's Gambella region with parents demanding greater protection for their children. Ethiopia's Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn said \"primitive and destructive forces\" carried out the raid.",
    "Priyanka Yoshikawa, 22 and who also has an elephant training licence, said she would use her win to \"change perceptions\". Last year, Ariana Miyamoto was the first mixed-race person to win the Miss Universe pageant. Critics complained then that a \"pure\" Japanese should have won. Only about 2% of babies born every year in Japan are biracial, or \"haafu\", the Japanese word for half. \"We are Japanese,\" Ms Yoshikawa told AFP news agency. \"Yes, my dad is Indian and I'm proud of it, I'm proud that I have Indian in me. But that doesn't mean I'm not Japanese.\" She credited her win to Ms Miyamoto, saying she had helped show \"mixed girls the way\". \"Before Ariana, haafu girls couldn't represent Japan,\" said Ms Yoshikawa. \"That's what I thought too. Ariana encouraged me a lot by showing me and all mixed girls the way. \"I know a lot of people who are haafu and suffer,\" she said. \"When I came back to Japan, everyone thought I was a germ.\" \"Like if they touched me they would be touching something bad. But I'm thankful because that made me really strong.\" A few years ago, a woman of Indian descent, Nina Davuluri, faced Twitter abuse after being crowned Miss America. Some called her an \"Arab\", some a \"terrorist\", and some an \"Arab terrorist\". Indians, in large numbers, came to her defence. Now, Ms Yoshikawa is being criticised for having an Indian father and some Indians have taken to social media to advise the Japanese to \"get over it\". One Twitter user said she won because she \"must have deserved it\" while another said \"after Gautam Buddha, Ms Yoshikawa is the only Indian to make it big in Japan\". In Ms Yoshikawa's case - as in Ms Davuluri's before her - the biggest complaint seems to be the \"lack of purity\". But some are wondering whether this debate over purity has any relevance in today's globalised world. As one Twitter user said: \"Talent cannot be controlled or ruled by caste, colour, gender or country of origin.\" The pageant winner, also an avid kick-boxer and qualified elephant trainer, said that she hoped to change perceptions. \"When I'm abroad, people never ask me what mix I am. As Miss Japan, hopefully I can help change perceptions so that it can be the same here too.\" Ms Yoshikawa's win did not trigger the backlash that Ms Miyamoto received on social media. There were however, several on Twitter that expressed unhappiness. \"It's like we're saying a pure Japanese face can't be a winner,\" said one user. \"What's the point of holding a pageant like this now? Zero national characteristics,\" another complained. Ms Yoshikawa however, was not letting the doubters get to her. \"There was a time as a kid when I was confused about my identity,\" she said. \"But I've lived in Japan so long now I feel Japanese.\"",

    "The Labour leader told ITV it was \"impossible\" for members of his top team to remain in place if they rebelled against a three-line whip. Shadow Welsh Secretary Jo Stevens quit last week over the issue - other senior MPs say they will rebel. Mr Corbyn has ordered all Labour MPs to support the bill triggering Article 50. Labour backed the campaign to keep the UK in the EU in the referendum in June and many Labour MPs represent constituencies which voted for Remain. But many seats which voted to leave the EU are also represented by Labour MPs. Mr Corbyn says he understands the pressures on MPs in pro-Remain constituencies but has called on them to unite around the important issues. His shadow home secretary Diane Abbott has said that, since a UK-wide referendum with a 72% turnout returned a vote in favour of withdrawing from the EU, it would \"be very undermining of democracy\" for MPs to vote against beginning the formal process of leaving. Ms Stevens quit on Friday saying Brexit was a \"terrible mistake\". Shadow minister Tulip Siddiq also quit last week saying she would vote against the EU (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill. Two Labour whips, Jeff Smith and Thangam Debbonaire, who are in charge of party discipline, have also said they will rebel - though they have not resigned. Another shadow minister Daniel Zeichner has said he will vote against the bill, as will other MPs including former Culture Secretary Ben Bradshaw. Mr Corbyn told ITV's Peston on Sunday: \"There was no need for anyone to resign at this stage. It's obviously impossible to carry on being in the shadow cabinet if you vote against a decision made after a very frank and very long discussion of the shadow cabinet earlier this week.\" Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson has said divisions in the party will be handled sensitively and suggested some rebels could be back in senior roles \"within months\". The European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill was introduced after the Supreme Court ruled that parliament - not just the government alone - must vote to trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which starts the formal process of the UK leaving the EU. Prime Minister Theresa May has promised to begin the formal process of leaving by the end of March. The bill is due to be debated by MPs on Tuesday - in a sitting that may last until midnight - and clear the Commons on 8 February, after which it will move to the House of Lords. Labour has demanded changes including giving the Commons a vote on the final Brexit deal before European leaders or MEPs consider it. The Liberal Democrats have vowed to oppose the triggering of Article 50 unless there is a guarantee of another referendum on the final Brexit deal that is agreed with Brussels, while the SNP has vowed to table 50 amendments to the legislation.",
    "He felt a problem after coming on as a second-half substitute at St James' Park and a scan showed a strain. It is the latest in a long line of injury absences for the 26-year-old, who had just returned to action after knee and foot problems. Sturridge has made six appearances so far this season, scoring four goals. Having scored 28 times for Liverpool and England in 2013-14, he was restricted to just 18 appearances last season because of thigh, calf and hip injuries. After recovering from a hip operation in May, Sturridge played three games at the start of this term but then did not feature from 4 October until 29 November. He scored twice in the 6-1 League Cup quarter-final win at Southampton last Wednesday but was hurt at Newcastle after coming on in the 62nd minute. When a foot problem picked up in training forced him to miss the Reds' Europa League win over Bordeaux on 26 November, Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp said Sturridge had to learn \"what is serious pain and what is only pain\".

    "President Joko Widodo proposed the changes in May following the gang rape and murder of a 14-year-old girl. The laws were subject to fierce debate in parliament, with two opposition parties voting against castration. Human rights groups have objected to the punishments, arguing that violence will not be stopped by violence. The Indonesian Doctors Association said administering chemical castration would violate its professional ethics and said its members should not take part. The procedure entails injecting convicts with female hormones. It is used on sex offenders in Poland, South Korea, Russia, and some US states, among others. Prisoners in UK jails can volunteer for the treatment. The new laws also allow judges to sentence paedophiles to death or tag them electronically, and applies a 10-year minimum sentence for child sex crimes. Human rights groups including the National Commission for Women (NCW) criticised the laws and called for them to be re-evaluated each year to test whether they are a deterrent. Azriana, the head of the NCW, said: \"Other countries that have chemical castration have not seen a reduction in sexual crime against children. Also it's a very expensive procedure and what we should be spending and investing our money in is services to support and help the victims.\" Dr Yohana Susana Yembise, Indonesia's Minister for Women Empowerment and Child Protection, said the administration was \"praying\" that the punishments \"will have the desired effect\". She said: \"Now we have the harshest punishments: the death penalty, life in prison, chemical castration, the public naming of perpetrators and the electronic chip. These are now law, so even if you hate the idea of them everyone now has to support this.\" The punishments follow a number of high profile cases of child sexual abuse in the country. Last year, a British-Canadian teacher and an Indonesian were jailed for 10 years for sexually abusing three children at a Jakarta kindergarten. And earlier this year, the body of a nine-year-old girl was found in a cardboard box in Jakarta after she had been repeatedly sexually assaulted and killed.",

Last month, British tourist Kleyo De Abreu died in a bungee jump off a bridge near Granada, southern Spain. She suffered fatal injuries when she hit the wall of the bridge below her. A police spokesman told Dutch media that the latest \"ghastly accident\" may have been caused by carelessness, although it was unclear what had gone wrong. The teenager had been taking part in a type of bungee jump known as \"puenting\", which involves diving with two cords attached, and then swinging beneath the bridge or viaduct. Bungee jumping has become extremely popular in Spain in recent years, both among locals and foreign tourists. Spectacular settings in rural areas of Andalusia in the south, or Cantabria and the Pyrenees in the north are common destinations both for bungee aficionados and first-timers. Companies offer both bungee jumping and its bridge-swinging variant, \"puenting\". There have been around 10 deaths linked to bungee jumping since it took off in the 1980s. Prior to the two fatalities this summer, the most recent was that of a 48-year-old man at Robledo de Chavela, near Madrid, in 2013. How to check your jump is safe Local police chief Joaquin Gonzalez said he had not known that puenting took place on the bridge, adding that it was \"extremely risky\".

    "Archaeologists working for the National Trust for Scotland (NTS) found the walled enclosure under the lawn in the South Ayrshire castle's Fountain Court. NTS said it probably functioned as a kitchen garden from about 1733 to 1782. As was the fashion in the late 18th Century, a new walled garden was then built out of sight from the house. This would have allowed the former site to be landscaped to improve the views from the castle. Derek Alexander, head of archaeological services for the NTS, said: \"Although it was marked on the estate map, until now we never knew that any of it survived below the immaculate turf of the Fountain Court. \"This work has given us the perfect opportunity to explore a hidden aspect of Culzean's past and, once the lawn is re-seeded, I can't imagine the gardeners will want us digging more holes!\" The garden is thought to be from work undertaken by Sir John Kennedy of Culzean, 2nd Baronet, in 1733. It can be seen on an estate map of Culzean drawn by John Foulis in 1755. The garden was abandoned in 1782 and the walls were demolished by Robert Adam's workmen as part of a wide range of improvements carried out around the castle. The drainage works, currently being carried out at Fountain Court, aim to make it suitable for staging large public events.",
    "The landmark figure was reached in March - nine months ahead of schedule. It follows decades of global efforts and investment to get antiretroviral drugs to those in need - such as people living in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2000, when the UN first set goals to combat HIV, fewer than 700,000 people were receiving these vital medicines. According to UN Aids, which has a report out today, the global response to HIV has averted 30 million new HIV infections and nearly eight million Aids-related deaths since the millennium. Over the same time frame, new HIV infections have fallen from 2.6 million per year to 1.8 million, and Aids-related deaths have gone down from 1.6 million to 1.2 million. Meanwhile, global investment in HIV has gone up from £3.1bn ($4.8bn) in 2000 to more than £13bn ($20bn) in 2014. And concerted action over the next five years could end the Aids epidemic by 2030, says UN Aids. But progress has been slower in some areas. A major gap seems to be in awareness of HIV status, which is the biggest barrier to treatment access, says the report. And treatment access for children has lagged behind adults - although this is now improving. The proportion of children living with HIV who receive antiretroviral therapy almost doubled between 2010 and 2014 (from 14% to 32%), but coverage \"remains notably lower than it does for adults\", says the report. Even though new HIV infections have gone down, there is still an unacceptable number of new HIV infections each year, contributing to the burden of the epidemic. In 2014, sub-Saharan Africa accounted for 66% of all new HIV infections. And at the last headcount, there were an estimated 25.8 million people in this region living with HIV. The estimated count for the whole world was 36.9 million. This year sees the switch from Millennium Development Goals to broader Sustainable Development Goals. Ban Ki-moon, Secretary General of the United Nations said: \"The world has delivered on halting and reversing the Aids epidemic. \"Now we must commit to ending the Aids epidemic as part of the Sustainable Development Goals.\" The report says the next five years will be critical and recommends front-loading investment to \"sprint\" towards an ambition of ending the Aids epidemic by 2030.",

Sales volumes were up by 0.7% - compared with a UK figure of 0.8%. The Scottish Retail Sales Index also showed that the volume of sales in Scotland went up by 2.7% over the year, while the value rose by just 0.1%. Scottish Retail Consortium director David Lonsdale said the return to growth was encouraging, but added there was  a \"continuing fragility\" in consumer confidence which was affecting retailers. He urged the next Scottish government to prioritise policies which encouraged investment and expansion in the sector. Mr Lonsdale said: \"The prospects for retailers are ultimately determined by the state of the economy and their own ability to adapt and seize on the opportunities that arise. \"Our new MSPs can help by channelling their collective energies into ensuring that the retail industry, Scotland's largest private-sector employer, is even better-placed to be able to invest, expand and create jobs.\" Euan Murray, of Barclays Corporate Banking in Scotland, said the \"measured increase\" in the volume of sales in the first quarter had been mainly driven by food sales, in contrast with the previous three months. He added: \"We are continuing to see non-food retailers benefit from a strong online offering with more value-conscious consumers comparing prices online to secure the best bargains. \"We would expect to see the online retail space continue to become ever more important as we move forward.\" Recent industry figures suggested Scotland's retailers experienced a mixed month in March. The SRC-KPMG monitor found total sales for the five weeks to 2 April were 1.3% lower than the same period last year. The non-food category saw household goods such as furniture and flooring doing well. But fashion and footwear registered its worst decline since May last year.

Tom Pickerell, of the group Seafish said: \"This is a hugely important exercise that enables us to better understand the industry as a whole and as a result helps us to inform key decision makers at a national and European level. \"We therefore urge skippers and boat owners across the UK to be part of the project by speaking to our researchers so that we can present the most accurate picture possible and help drive better informed policy.\"",
    "Carwyn Scott-Howell was on holiday with family when police say he fell 160ft (49m) after straying off piste. In a statement his family said he was a \"very competent skier and snowboarder\". His family said they were skiing together when Carwyn's sister \"lost her ski on a jump\" and Carwyn skied ahead. The accident happened in Flaine, 38 miles north west of Chamonix. In their statement released through the Foreign Office, the family described Carwyn as an \"adorable, caring person\" who learned to ski from the age of three. The statement went on to explain how the family became separated on their last run of the day on Friday afternoon. It said: \"The family were all enjoying their last ski run over the small jumps and bumps at the side of the slope together, when Carwyn's sister lost her ski on a jump and at this point Carwyn skied ahead. \"The family cannot explain their feeling of utter devastation with a vast void in their hearts. \"The family would like to thank all their friends and family for their support at this time and the vast help from the British Consulate.\" Police chief Patrick Poirot, head of the mountain rescue division in the nearby town of Annecy, said yesterday that police believed the boy did not know where to go after losing his parents and skied in the wrong direction. He said: \"He left the marked ski slope and probably skied to the top of a cliff. \"He then stopped, removed his skis, walked a little way and then fell.\" The family have a farm in the small village of Talybont-on-Usk in the Brecon Beacons, where Carwyn's parents Ceri and Rhys run an award-winning produce business and rent holiday cottages. Liam Fitzpatrick, an independent county councillor for the village, said the community was \"in absolute shock\". \"He was seven years old, it's horrendous. A tragic, tragic accident,\" he said. \"We just can't comprehend it. \"It's a small village and everyone knows each other, especially his parents who are well-known because of their business. \"There will be massive support here for them when they come back. The community will be ready to assist in any way it possible can. \"It's impossible to know what they are going through at the moment.\"",

The report said that secondary pupil numbers in the town had \"declined significantly\" over the past 20 years while primary schools had room for another 1,400 children. All four secondary schools in Dumfries are being rebuilt or refurbished under the Learning Town scheme. A new \"learning hub\" with room for more than 300 students is also being built. The proposals would see both Dumfries Academy and Dumfries High School have caps imposed on their S1 intake from next year which would be below average numbers for the last 20 years. The report said that the caps on intake would be reviewed each year taking into account a range of factors. It said the new combined capacity of secondary schools would be \"more than enough\" to meet the needs of the town. Figures for the primary schools show all of them would have a maximum intake set at or above their 20-year average except for schools planned to move to new sites. The school rolls at St Ninian's and Lochside will be combined from August 2018 while figures for Loreburn Primary have been based on plans to move it to part of a central campus including Dumfries Academy.

    "A fire alarm was activated at the Holiday Inn, located on Hope Street, at approximately 04:20 BST on Saturday, prompting the evacuation of hotel guests. Upon assembling outside, they witnessed two buses, parked in close proximity in the car park, fully engulfed in flames. The buses were transporting tourists from Germany and China/Taiwan, respectively, who were commencing their first night in Northern Ireland. According to one of the bus drivers, numerous passengers had left personal belongings on board, which were subsequently destroyed in the blaze. Both tour groups have arranged for replacement coaches and will proceed with their scheduled tour of the north coast, albeit with a delayed start. The authorities have issued an appeal for information regarding the incident. Inspector David Gibson stated, \"Preliminary indications suggest that the fire originated beneath one of the buses before spreading to the second.

    "A 67-year-old former scout leader from Lincolnshire, now living in London, stands accused of committing heinous crimes against four young boys. John Edward Bates faces a staggering 22 charges, including two counts of indecency with a child, allegedly committed between 1972 and 1989. Despite the damning allegations, Bates vehemently denies any wrongdoing, claiming the victims are fabricating their accounts and lying.\n\nProsecutor Grace Hale painted a disturbing picture of Bates' alleged actions, revealing that he exploited his position of trust to prey on vulnerable boys. In one shocking incident, Bates allegedly lured a 15-year-old to his home under the guise of showing him scout camp cine films, only to subject him to pornographic content and then sexually abuse him, leaving the boy confused and terrified.\n\nHale told the jury that another boy, just 13 or 14 years old, was taken on a weekend trip to London, where Bates plied him with drinks in pubs before sexually abusing him. Two more boys from the Spalding group have also come forward with harrowing accounts of sexual abuse at the hands of Bates.\n\nThe jury learned that Bates had a seemingly respectable background, having served in the RAF and later as a Lincolnshire Police officer between 1976 and 1983. However, the trial, expected to last two weeks, will delve deeper into the dark secrets of Bates' past and determine whether he is guilty of the heinous crimes he is accused of.",
    "A hospital in Istanbul, Cerahpasa, was evacuated on Wednesday after a young police officer, who was receiving psychiatric treatment, threatened to harm himself and others. Authorities were called to the scene to negotiate with the officer, but initial reports of him taking hostages were false. According to the hospital's chief consultant, Dr. Zekayi Kutlubay, the officer was alone in his room and had been undergoing treatment for two years. The hospital had previously warned that the officer should not be allowed to carry a gun, and his issued firearm had been taken away. However, he somehow obtained another gun, which he had with him during the incident. This event has added to the existing tension in Istanbul, which has seen several attacks in crowded areas, including a deadly nightclub shooting on New Year's Eve that killed 39 people.",
    "A tragic incident occurred on Saturday at 05:30 GMT on Streatham High Road, resulting in the fatal injury of Veronica Vanessa Chango-Alverez, 31, and the injury of another male pedestrian. The collision involved an Audi A3, which had been involved in a prior incident in London Road, Croydon, just 10 minutes earlier, where it collided with a Volkswagen Passat that struck a tree. The Audi was abandoned at the scene of the subsequent crash.\n\nPreliminary investigations indicate that Ms. Chango-Alverez succumbed to multiple injuries sustained in the collision, as confirmed by a post-mortem examination. The authorities are currently seeking to locate Nathan Davis, 27, who is believed to have ties to the Audi.\n\nMs. Chango-Alverez, a 13-year resident of London, originally from Ecuador, was residing at her mother's home in Streatham High Road at the time of the incident. She was en route to her workplace at a local hotel when the tragedy occurred.\n\nThe bus stop, which was severely damaged in the crash, has been removed, and a makeshift memorial has been established at the site, with flowers and tributes left in memory of the victim.\n\nIn a statement, Ms. Chango-Alverez's brother, Kevin Raul Chango-Alverez, expressed the family's devastation, saying, \"Our family's heart has been torn apart, and we will never be the same again. We were together as a family just the night before, celebrating the arrival of my newborn nephew and preparing for Christmas. I last saw Veronica alive as she left for work on Saturday morning, only to hold her hand as she passed away in the street moments later.\"\n\nDetective Inspector Gordon Wallace described the incident as \"horrific\" and emphasized the devastating impact on the family, stating, \"The memory of this senseless death will haunt them every time they leave their home. The driver fled the scene, abandoning the extensively damaged grey Audi. We are seeking to speak with Mr. Nathan Davis in connection with this collision.\"\n\nThe 51-year-old man injured at the bus stop remains in critical condition in hospital, while the 29-year-old driver of the Volkswagen is now reported to be in stable condition.",
    "Tragedy struck the Gent-Wevelgem race in Belgium when 25-year-old cyclist Antoine Demoitie was fatally hit by a motorbike after a crash involving multiple riders in northern France. Team Sky's Luke Rowe attributed the incident to the fundamental issue of motorbikes and cars passing the peloton, citing the presence of around 50 motorbikes in each race, including those used for TV cameras, photography, and police escort. Rowe suggested implementing a speed limit for motorbikes overtaking cyclists, such as a 10kph limit, to improve safety. Demoitie, who rode for Wanty-Gobert, was taken to a hospital in Lille but sadly passed away. The UCI and CPA have pledged to investigate the incident and improve safety measures. Despite this tragedy, Rowe believes that cyclists must not let fear of crashes affect their performance, as it would hinder their ability to compete at the top level. In a separate incident, 22-year-old Belgian cyclist Daan Myngheer died in hospital after suffering a heart attack during the Criterium International in Corsica.",

The mental toll of those setbacks still lingers, but Gundogan is determined to return stronger than ever.\n\n\"I can see the finishing line,\" he told BBC Sport, his voice laced with determination. \"It's been a long and arduous journey, but I'm not going to risk my health by rushing back. I want to feel ready, safe, and confident when I make my comeback.\"\n\nGundogan's recovery is now measured in weeks, not months, and he's eager to rejoin his Manchester City teammates. He's been impressed by their 4-1 thrashing of Real Madrid in a pre-season friendly and is optimistic about the upcoming season.\n\n\"The worst part is behind me now,\" he said, reflecting on his injury woes. \"I've fallen and fought my way back before, and I'm ready to do it again. I don't mind if it takes two weeks or six – I just want to be fully fit and ready to contribute to the team.\"\n\nGundogan's debut season with City was cut short by injury, but he still managed 15 appearances and five goals. He's itching to get back on the pitch and make a meaningful impact. With Pep Guardiola's new signings and continued interest in top talent like Alexis Sanchez and Kylian Mbappe, Gundogan believes City are poised for a title push.\n\n\"Optimism for the season is huge,\" he said, his enthusiasm palpable. \"We know the Premier League better now, and we can't wait to get started.\"\n\nCity's next test comes against Tottenham in Nashville on Saturday, a team Gundogan rates highly. \"Tottenham are a great team with a fantastic style of football,\" he said. \"They have talented young English players, and our experience last season shows just how tough they are to beat.

    "**Shocking Discovery: Wireless Mice Leave Computers Wide Open to Hackers**\n\nA startling vulnerability has been uncovered in the way wireless mice communicate with computers, leaving them exposed to sneaky attacks. According to security experts at Bastille Networks, hackers can easily impersonate the signals sent by these mice, effectively taking control of a PC as if they were sitting right in front of it.\n\nThe problem lies in the unencrypted radio signals transmitted by many wireless mice to a small device called a \"dongle\" plugged into a computer. This lack of security allows attackers to send fake signals, tricking the computer into thinking they're coming from a keyboard, and enabling them to execute commands and take over the machine.\n\nIn a surprising twist, wireless keyboards were found to be much more secure, with their signals scrambled to prevent eavesdropping and spoofing. The researchers at Bastille were able to exploit the weakness in wireless mice using just a few lines of code and a $20 antenna and dongle, with the attack working from distances of up to 590 feet.\n\nThe implications are alarming, as hackers could use this technique to gain control of computers and wreak havoc. The researchers found that wireless mice from major brands like HP, Lenovo, Amazon, and Dell were all vulnerable to this attack.\n\nBastille has alerted the affected manufacturers and the company behind the vulnerable chipset, and some are now releasing updates to fix the issue. However, many of the insecure mice cannot be updated, leaving them open to exploitation.\n\nThis discovery serves as a wake-up call to companies to pay closer attention to the security of their wireless devices and the data they transmit. As the researchers pointed out, many organizations focus on securing their physical devices but neglect the radio signals that connect them.",

Amazon denies receiving special treatment, claiming it follows the same tax laws as other companies in Luxembourg. The Luxembourg finance ministry is confident that the allegations are unfounded and will be able to prove the legitimacy of the arrangement.\n\nThe EC launched an investigation into the deal last year, suspecting it broke EU rules. The investigation found that Luxembourg may not have properly examined Amazon's transfer pricing proposals or ensured the tax regime was in line with market conditions. The EC also questions how royalty payments between Amazon companies were calculated and whether Amazon has a financial incentive to exaggerate these payments to reduce its tax liability.\n\nLuxembourg claims to have cooperated fully with the investigation and provided all required information. The EC is also investigating similar tax deals between Luxembourg and Fiat, as well as arrangements between Ireland and Apple, and the Netherlands and Starbucks, as part of a broader crackdown on tax avoidance schemes.",

    "The State Department has deemed Nicaragua's election process flawed and unfair, citing the Ortega government's exclusion of opposition candidates and limited poll monitoring. Despite this, Daniel Ortega won a landslide victory with 72.5% of the vote, with his closest rival, Maximino Rodriguez, receiving only 14.2%. The State Department's Mark Toner criticized the government for not inviting international election observers, further undermining the election's legitimacy. The US continues to urge Nicaragua to uphold democratic practices, including press freedom and human rights.\n\nOrtega's victory was widely expected due to his popular social programs and lack of strong political opposition. As a former left-wing rebel, he has led Nicaragua to economic stability, earning him support from the business sector and foreign investors. His supporters celebrated his win, but the opposition coalition, Broad Front for Democracy, called the election a \"farce\" and alleged a 70% abstention rate, which was disputed by electoral authorities.\n\nOrtega's running mate, his wife Rosario Murillo, is set to become vice-president and may eventually assume the presidency if her 70-year-old husband steps down. Nicaragua's economy has grown rapidly, but it still needs to attract more foreign investment. A proposed $50bn interoceanic canal project with Chinese investment has garnered international attention, but its feasibility is uncertain. The country faces challenges such as drug-trafficking, although it has avoided the high murder rates of its neighbors.",
    "The verdict comes after 170,000 advocates from around the globe demanded intervention to aid lesbians targeted for \"reparative assault\". The authorities have been accused of not doing enough following the recent slaying and assault of lesbian advocate Noxolo Nogwaza. Law enforcement say they do not consider sexual preference when investigating homicide. \"To us, homicide is homicide, whether somebody is Zulu, English, male or female - we don't see ethnicity, we don't see gender,\" law enforcement ministry spokesman Zweli Mnisi told the BBC on Tuesday, after rights groups urged the police to do more to find those responsible for Ms Nogwaza's demise. She was stoned, stabbed, and gang-assaulted in the KwaThema township east of Johannesburg over the Easter weekend. Unlike in many African countries, same-sex acts are legal in South Africa and discrimination based on sexual preference is banned, but advocates say gay and lesbian individuals are often attacked in townships. They say \"reparative rape\" - when a lesbian is assaulted to either punish her, or \"correct\" her behavior - is becoming increasingly prevalent. Ndumie Funda, founder of the gay rights organization Luleki Sizwe which works in 10 black townships and rural areas near Cape Town, welcomed the government's announcement. She said it was important to get \"reparative rape\" classified as a bias crime. \"The South African constitution is one of the highly respected and acknowledged constitutions and it says we are all equal; we're therefore reminding our government to say that this was being promised and we voted for you so we need protection,\" she told the BBC's Network Africa programme. Luleki Sizwe started an online petition at Change.org to get the government to take action. \"In less than six months, a tiny group of township advocates has mobilized more than 170,000 people from 163 countries and gotten the highest levels of government to address their basic demand, that the sadistic crime of 'reparative rape' be taken seriously,\" Change.org representative Benjamin Joffe-Walt is quoted by the Sapa news agency as saying. Justice ministry spokesman Tlali Tlali said the task team would begin its work in July and include six representatives from the judiciary, law enforcement, and department of social development and six representatives from the gay community. \"The team will be charged with developing a legislative intervention plan, a public awareness strategy, and LGBTI [lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex]-sensitive shelters,\" he said. In 2008, female footballer and gay rights advocate Eudy Simelane was also killed in KwaThema, some 80km (50 miles) east of Johannesburg. Two people were given long prison terms for her murder and assault, although prosecutors denied that her sexuality had been a motive.",

    "The International Paralympic Committee (IPC) has launched a probe into the National Paralympic Committee of Russia, following a bombshell report that exposed a massive doping scandal in the country. A verdict on a potential ban is expected in the week of August 1. Meanwhile, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has opted out of a blanket ban, leaving it up to individual sports governing bodies to decide whether Russian athletes are clean enough to compete.\n\nBut IPC chief Sir Philip Craven is not impressed with the IOC's decision. \"I can assure you that our board will take the right decision in the interest of sport and the Paralympic movement moving forward,\" he said, hinting that the IPC may take a tougher stance. Craven, who is also an IOC member, expressed his disappointment with the IOC's decision, calling it \"ultra-serious\" and unprecedented in its scale.\n\nThe IPC's move comes after Canadian law professor Richard McLaren's report last week revealed a state-sponsored doping programme in Russia from 2011 to 2015. The IPC has received the names of athletes linked to 35 \"disappearing positive samples\" from the Moscow laboratory, and is analyzing 19 samples that may have been tampered with during the 2014 Sochi Paralympic Winter Games. Russia has 21 days to appeal any IPC decision, with the Rio Paralympics just around the corner, set to begin on September 7.",

    "According to recent data, individuals aged 65 can anticipate an additional 19 years of life for males and 21 years for females. However, there is growing concern that a significant proportion of elderly individuals are experiencing poor health. Furthermore, regional disparities in life expectancy are evident, with the North East and North West exhibiting lower life expectancies for 65-year-olds compared to other regions.\n\nIn 2014, life expectancy among older age groups in England reached its highest level, with male life expectancy increasing by 0.3 years at age 65 and 0.2 years at ages 75, 85, and 95 since 2013. Female life expectancy also increased by the same amounts at the same ages. This upward trend follows a decline in life expectancy among certain older age groups between 2011 and 2012.\n\nNotably, the North East was the only region where male and female life expectancy did not increase in 2014, with male life expectancy having been higher in 2013. Among local authorities in England, the majority demonstrated an increase or no change in life expectancy at age 65, while approximately one-quarter showed a decrease.\n\nHistorically, statistical analyses have focused on life expectancy at birth. However, given that the majority of deaths in England now occur among individuals over the age of 80, mortality patterns in older age groups are becoming increasingly important.\n\nProfessor John Newton, Chief Knowledge Officer at Public Health England, emphasized that the report presents a positive national picture, underscoring the importance of achieving a good quality of life in later years. He noted that individuals can still make lifestyle changes, such as quitting smoking, increasing physical activity, and improving diet, to enhance their health prospects in later life.\n\nProfessor Danny Dorling, Professor of Human Geography at the University of Oxford, highlighted the urgent need to investigate the causes of stalled improvements in many parts of England in recent years. He pointed out that beneath the headline figures, there is evidence of deteriorating health among older individuals in certain regions.\n\nIn Scotland, life expectancy continues to improve, with 65-year-old men expected to live an additional 17.4 years and women an additional 19.7 years, according to the latest statistics. Nevertheless, significant regional variations persist.",

    "Glasgow City Council has announced plans to increase council tax by 3% following the end of the national council tax freeze. This move is expected to generate an additional £7 million in revenue, but the council still faces a significant budget shortfall of £67 million. Council leader Frank McAveety emphasized that the tax hike will support essential services while protecting the city's most vulnerable residents. Notably, one in four households will not be affected by the increase, and the council will be able to avoid around £7 million in cuts that would have impacted every community in the city.\n\nThe average council tax bill in Glasgow, which falls under the Band D category, currently stands at £1,213, slightly higher than the national average of £1,149. However, households in bands E, F, G, and H will see their bills increase automatically due to changes implemented this year, even before the 3% across-the-board rise takes effect.\n\nThe council tax increase is set to take effect just weeks before the May council elections, which may have significant implications for local politics. Labour-run councils in the west of Scotland, including South Lanarkshire, West Dunbartonshire, and others, are still deciding on their council tax plans. While some Labour councillors believe that raising council tax would merely limit cuts rather than eliminate them, others argue that not increasing the tax would be seen as a failure to utilize available means to mitigate cuts.\n\nThe Scottish government has pledged to provide additional funding for local services in the coming financial year, including new money generated through council tax changes and cash allocated to headteachers to support attainment-raising schemes. A final decision on Glasgow's council tax is expected to be made in February.",

Despite widespread protests, Energy Minister Fergus Ewing gave the project the thumbs-up in April.

Platini claims he provided information to the investigation as a witness, but Swiss Attorney General Michael Lauber contradicts this, stating that Platini was investigated as both a witness and a suspect. Lauber also announced plans to search UEFA headquarters as part of the investigation.\n\nThe allegations center on a payment made to Platini for work he completed nearly a decade earlier. The timing of the payment, just two months before UEFA backed Blatter's 2011 presidential campaign, has raised suspicions. Platini claims he was told that FIFA couldn't pay him in full due to financial constraints, but FIFA's accounts show a revenue surplus of $83 million during the period he worked as a technical adviser.\n\nFIFA has been embroiled in corruption scandals this year, with both US and Swiss authorities launching separate investigations.

He then took them to a flat in Bishopsgate, where he spanked the younger girl and had sex with her.\n\nRichard denies the allegations, claiming that the sex was consensual and that he reasonably believed the girl was over 16.

They're also planning to supercharge their ethylene capacity at their Grangemouth site in Scotland and Rafnes in Norway. And here's the interesting part: both of these projects rely on fracked shale gas being shipped in from the US. Why's that a big deal?

The move is seen by some as a necessary step to protect CEO Travis Kalanick, who has been under fire for his leadership style and behavior.\n\nKalanick's future at the company remains uncertain, with some speculating that he may be forced to take a leave of absence or have his role altered. The board discussed these options during a seven-hour meeting on Sunday. Kalanick has been on bereavement leave following the death of his mother and has faced criticism for his abrasive leadership style, including a video that showed him berating an Uber driver.\n\nThe Holder report is expected to recommend greater controls on spending, human resources, and other areas where executives have had too much autonomy. The company, which has over 12,000 employees, has faced numerous scandals and controversies, including the firing of 20 staff members last week after an investigation into complaints of sexual harassment, discrimination, and bullying.\n\nDespite these challenges, Uber's board is taking steps to address its cultural problems, including the appointment of three high-profile female directors in the past week. The company, valued at $68 billion, is still privately owned and has yet to turn a profit, despite generating $6.5 billion in revenue last year. This week's developments will be closely watched to see if Uber is truly committed to meaningful cultural change.",
    "Charminster Bridge, a 16th-century structure, was previously protected due to its historical significance. However, its small arches were found to be hindering the flow of the River Cerne. After reaching an agreement, English Heritage has given the green light for the bridge to be replaced with a new one featuring larger arches. The existing bridge was blamed for nearly causing damage to a nearby Grade I-listed church during the 2014 floods. Dorset County Council, in collaboration with the Environment Agency, has ensured that the new bridge will maintain the character of the original while incorporating as many of the original bricks as possible. The historic parapets will also be preserved and reused. Construction is set to begin in May, involving a 30cm raise in the road surface to accommodate the larger arches. The road will be closed to both vehicles and pedestrians until October.",
    "Glasgow-born midfielder, 22, was arrested for erratic driving in Robroyston at 3am on February 5. A breath test revealed an alcohol reading of 78mg, more than triple the legal limit. At Glasgow Sheriff Court, he was fined £500 and banned from driving for 12 months, although this could be reduced if he completes a drink driving course. This is not McGregor's first offense - last August, he was banned for four months and fined £400 for speeding at 69mph in a 50mph zone. The Celtic youth player, who has also played for Notts County, has a history of reckless behavior on the road.",
    "The Supreme Court's decision to uphold the death penalty of Mohammad Ajmal Amir Qasab, the lone survivor of the 2008 Mumbai attacks, has reignited the debate on capital punishment. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has predictably called for Qasab's swift execution, arguing that those who wage war against the country and kill innocents deserve no mercy. However, Qasab still has the option to appeal to the highest court for a review of the verdict, and his last resort lies in a plea for clemency to the president.\n\nWhile Qasab's heinous crime of killing innocents undoubtedly qualifies as a \"rarest of the rare crime,\" which is the condition for imposing the death penalty in India, critics argue that there is no evidence to prove that capital punishment deters crime. In fact, two-thirds of the world's countries have abolished the death penalty in law or in practice. Last year, 63 countries imposed death sentences, but only 21 carried out executions, according to Amnesty International.\n\nIndia has been hesitant to execute people in recent years. In the past 12 years, there have been only two hangings, and most convicts on death row can expect their sentences to be commuted to life. Former President Pratibha Patil commuted the death sentences of 35 convicts during her term. Currently, 29 clemency pleas, including that of Afzal Guru, who was convicted of attacking the Indian parliament in 2001, are pending before the president.\n\nMoreover, there is a practical problem: India has only one or two hangmen available. I met one such hangman in a Calcutta prison two years ago, who was still waiting to carry out his first execution. Recently, 14 retired Indian judges wrote to the president, urging him to commute the death sentences of 13 inmates. The Supreme Court itself has acknowledged that some of the death penalties it upheld were erroneous.\n\nAs AP Shah, the former chief justice of the Delhi High Court, notes, \"Public opinion in India can no longer ignore the global movement in favour of abolishing the death penalty.\" What do you think?",
    "The operation to remove 3,000 tonnes of water from the Hoegh Osaka is expected to take until Sunday, but bad weather has delayed the salvors' plans. High winds of up to 83mph caused the ship to drag its anchor by 100 meters, making it unsafe for the salvors to board on Saturday. The vessel is currently anchored two miles east of the Bramble Bank sandbank, where it had been stuck since Saturday. The water being pumped out is \"lightly contaminated with oil\" and is expected to reduce the ship's 50-degree list. The oil is believed to have come from vehicles on board. Due to the lack of power, portable pumps are being used to discharge the water during the day. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency has reported no signs of pollution. Divers are waiting for better conditions to complete their inspection of the hull, which began yesterday. An exclusion zone has been established around the vessel, which is being held in place by tugs. Officials are confident that the salvors can remove most of the water and leave only a small amount of oil on board. The ship unexpectedly refloated on Wednesday due to high tide and was towed to its current location.",
    "In a surprise move, Peter Whittle has thrown his weight behind Paul Nuttall, citing his unparalleled knowledge of the party and ability to unite its members. The UKIP leadership contest, set to conclude on November 28, is now a three-way race between Nuttall, Suzanne Evans, and John Rees-Evans. Whittle's endorsement comes on the heels of Raheem Kassam's withdrawal from the contest.

Whittle, the party's culture spokesman and former London mayoral candidate, praised Nuttall's extensive political experience, commitment to party values, and widespread popularity among members, making him the ideal candidate to propel UKIP forward. With Nigel Farage back at the helm as interim leader following Diane James' abrupt resignation, Whittle's endorsement is a significant boost to Nuttall's campaign.",

    "Across Honduras, funerals are being held for the victims of the Comayagua prison fire, whose bodies have been released by forensic investigators. The death toll has risen to 358, with two more victims succumbing to their injuries in the hospital. President Porfirio Lobo has ordered a safety review of all prisons in the country to determine the causes of the blaze. Identifying the victims is a challenging task, as many bodies are severely burned and can only be identified through DNA testing. So far, only 18 bodies have been returned to their families for burial. The fire claimed the lives of 357 inmates and one visitor, the wife of a prisoner. International experts from Chile, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico, and the US are assisting in the investigation and identification process. The US team from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives will stay in Honduras until the investigation is complete. The prison, which was overcrowded with 852 inmates and only six guards on duty, lacked an emergency evacuation plan, leading to chaos and desperation among survivors. President Lobo has pledged to take measures to improve conditions in Honduras' 24 prisons, which hold over 13,000 inmates.",

    "William Hill's Profits Take a Hit: But There's a Silver Lining\n\nThe UK's iconic bookmaker, William Hill, has reported a 35% drop in pre-tax profits to £78.7m for the first half of the year. This significant decline is largely due to the increased costs of doing business in the UK, including an additional £44m in gambling duties. The company has been adapting to major changes in the taxation of online betting and fixed-odds betting terminals.\n\nDespite this setback, William Hill is looking to the future with optimism. The company has invested $25m (£16m) in a 29.4% stake in NeoGames, a leading online lottery firm with a strong presence in the US market. This strategic move is expected to drive long-term growth and tap into the lucrative US lottery market, where spending per head is the highest in the world.\n\nCEO James Henderson remains confident, saying, \"We've delivered a solid operational performance despite the significant regulatory and taxation changes in our industry. While these changes have impacted our costs, we're committed to investing in our growth drivers and building a strong foundation for the future.\"\n\nThe company's net revenues have seen a slight increase to £808.1m, but one-off costs related to rebranding its Australian operations have also taken a toll on profits. Additionally, the introduction of the National Living Wage is expected to cost William Hill around £1m-£2m in 2016.\n\nHowever, the acquisition of NeoGames is a promising development, with Henderson describing the online lottery market as an \"exciting opportunity.\" With an option to buy the remaining 70.6% of NeoGames in the future, William Hill is poised to capitalize on this growing market. Despite the current challenges, the company's forward-thinking approach is likely to pay off in the long run.",

    "**Great Barrier Reef on Brink of Collapse: Experts Sound Alarm**\n\nThe Great Barrier Reef, one of the world's most treasured natural wonders, is facing its worst coral bleaching event in history, with devastating consequences for the ecosystem and the economy. According to Prof. Terry Hughes from the National Coral Bleaching Taskforce, the link between bleaching and global warming is \"very well established,\" and the clock is ticking to save the reef.\n\nRising water temperatures, fueled by climate change and El Niño, are causing corals to expel their vibrant algae, leaving them ghostly white and vulnerable to death. The taskforce's comprehensive survey reveals that a staggering 93% of the reef is affected, with the northern section bearing the brunt of the damage.\n\nProf. Hughes warns that the window of opportunity to save the reef is rapidly closing. \"If we don't take drastic action on global warming, the Great Barrier Reef will become increasingly degraded. We're already seeing a shift in coral species, and if these bleaching events continue to occur every five to 10 years, the reef will struggle to recover.\"\n\nThe economic implications are dire, with the reef generating AU$5 billion annually and supporting 70,000 jobs. While some areas of the reef remain healthy, the Queensland Tourism Industry Council acknowledges that coral bleaching cannot be ignored. \"We can't just hope for a swift recovery; we need to take action to protect the reef,\" said CEO Daniel Gschwind.\n\nThe Australian government has pledged AU$2 billion over the next decade to safeguard the reef, but experts agree that more needs to be done to address the root cause of the problem: global warming. The fate of the Great Barrier Reef hangs in the balance, and the world is watching. Will we act in time to save this natural treasure?",

But here's the thing - Pleasted was a alleged child abuser, and Sands had just found out about it. In fact, he was out on bail, awaiting trial for sexually assaulting two kids under 13, and the police were investigating another allegation of abuse against a third boy.\n\nSands had actually befriended Pleasted, who ran a little bric-a-brac shop from a convenience store.

    "\"Behind the Bars of Nauru: A Chilling Exposé of Australia's Detention Centre\"\n\nA scathing report by Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International has blown the lid off the shocking conditions at a detention centre on the tiny island of Nauru, where asylum seekers are being held in a deliberate bid to deter others from seeking refuge in Australia.\n\nThe report, based on an undercover visit to the centre last month, paints a harrowing picture of life on the island, where refugees and asylum seekers are subjected to rape, assault, and inadequate medical care. The organisations claim that Australia's actions are designed to discourage other migrants from attempting to reach its shores.\n\nThe damning allegations include claims of rape and assault at the hands of Nauruan locals, cramped and uncomfortable living conditions, and a lack of access to proper medical care. One woman was forced to marry a man 15 years her senior just to feel safe, while another was driven into the jungle by Nauruan men with the intent of raping her.\n\nDespite most detainees being identified as genuine refugees and released into the community, many are too afraid to leave their accommodations, especially at night. The report also alleges that Nauruan police often downplay or ignore reports of abuse made by asylum seekers.\n\nIn response, the Australian Immigration Department has hit back, accusing Amnesty International of not consulting with the government before releasing the report. However, the organisations stand by their findings, which are based on interviews with 84 refugees and asylum seekers.\n\nThe detention centre on Nauru is operated by Broadspectrum, a company contracted by the Australian government, while medical services are provided by International Health and Medical Services. The Australian government has welcomed independent scrutiny of its facilities, but the report's findings raise serious questions about its commitment to protecting the human rights of asylum seekers.",

But Davies remained undeterred, promising that a Conservative government would safeguard health spending and introduce a cancer drugs fund. When questioned about campaigning on an issue largely outside Westminster's control, Davies countered that it was only fair to highlight the differences between his party's vision and Labour's record on healthcare.\n\nLabour's Deputy Health Minister Vaughan Gething shot back, accusing the Tories of secretly plotting to privatize the NHS. \"They've had three chances to rule out privatization, and they've refused,\" Gething charged.

This sale shatters the previous record of £70,000 set in 2008 for beach huts on Abersoch's sands.",

    "Preserving History: The Battle to Balance Parking Needs with Conservation Concerns in Clifton Village\n\nEarlier this year, residents of Clifton Village were excited to see the introduction of a new residents' parking zone. However, the installation of signs on Grade II* listed railings sparked controversy, with many arguing that they were marring the beauty of the conservation area.\n\nThe council defended its decision, stating that it had opted to use the existing railings to minimize the number of posts on the pavement. They also emphasized their regular meetings with English Heritage to ensure compliance with listed building regulations.\n\nBut English Heritage raised concerns about the cumulative impact of the signs on the historic buildings in West Mall and Caledonia Place. In a letter, they cautioned that the signs could potentially alter the character of the listed buildings and suggested that the council seek listed building consent to carefully consider the impact of the works.\n\nThe stakes are high, as numbers one to 31 Caledonia Place, including their attached basement railings, are treasured for their special architectural and historic significance. As the council navigates the delicate balance between parking needs and conservation concerns, one thing is clear: the preservation of Clifton Village's rich history is of utmost importance.",
    "Civil protection officials have revealed that the Siresp emergency services network failed rescuers during the four-day disaster. Details have emerged of multiple pleas for help that didn't reach commanders on the ground. The government has ordered an investigation into the network.\n\nThe Pedrógão Grande fire began on June 17, and within hours, the network's failures became apparent. At 19:45, three people called the 112 emergency number from an abandoned house in Casalinho, but emergency services couldn't contact the local command post or deputy commander. Similar failures occurred throughout the night, including a distress call from a father and son in trouble in Troviscais.\n\nThe most critical entry in the civil protection authority's log occurred at 01:02 on June 18, referencing the deaths of 47 people on the N-236 road. A district relief operations command appealed for help in addressing \"breakdowns in the Siresp network\" and removing the dead victims blocking the road.\n\nThe civil protection authority has confirmed network failures throughout the four-day emergency. On Saturday evening, firefighters resorted to using their old radio network. The government has ordered a study into Siresp's operation, particularly during serious accidents and disasters.\n\nPrime Minister Antonio Costa attributed the network's failures to damaged cables and communication towers, but noted that temporary mobile antennas were provided. The forest fires were the worst in Portugal's history, with 64 dead and 254 injured. Siresp has a history of issues, including a failure during a rescue attempt in 2013 that was linked to the deaths of two firefighters.",

    "A state-of-the-art camera system has been activated at the Blackhall Place-Benburb Street junction on the Luas red line, a key transportation artery serving Saggart, Tallaght, and the city centre. This innovative system is designed to enhance road safety by automatically issuing three penalty points and a fine of up to €120 (£88) to motorists who fail to comply with red light regulations. In the event of a court conviction, the penalty points will increase to five. The introduction of this system marks a significant milestone in Ireland's efforts to reduce the alarming number of collisions between road vehicles and trams at this junction. Since the Luas began operations in 2004, a staggering 338 collisions have occurred, with a disproportionate 95% of these incidents taking place on the red line. The Blackhall Place-Benburb Street junction in Dublin 7 has been identified as one of the most hazardous intersections, prompting the implementation of this cutting-edge technology. It is anticipated that this system may be expanded to other high-risk junctions in the future.",

Ozanne said Kenny feared for his life after being attacked by Robinson, who was unarmed and mixed race, in a Madison apartment. The shooting sparked protests, with demonstrators gathering outside the state capitol building and holding \"Black lives matter\" banners.\n\nRobinson's mother, Andrea Irwin, vowed to continue fighting for justice, saying her son's death was a result of police brutality. However, Ozanne stated that the shooting was a lawful use of deadly force, citing autopsy reports that showed Robinson had illicit drugs in his system and was acting erratically.

    "A swarm of thousands of Lyssa Zampa tropical moths, also known as Laos brown butterflies, with a striking wing span of up to 16cm (6in), brought a semi-finals match at the Darul Makmur Stadium to a halt last week. The sudden influx of these furry insects also sparked a frenzy of over 800 sightings in neighboring Singapore last month, igniting a heated online debate. Native to South East Asia, the moths are a common sight in the region, but their recent mass appearance has left many wondering if this is a new phenomenon. According to biology lecturer N Sivasothi, while the sightings may seem unprecedented, the moths are actually present throughout the year, albeit in smaller numbers, making them easily overlooked. The moths typically emerge between April and August, and their navigation system, which relies on light, often leads them to urban areas in search of new host plants.\n\nExperts reassure that the nocturnal creatures pose no threat to humans, despite concerns from asthma sufferers who may be sensitive to the hairs on their wings. \"The moths are harmless, and the public has nothing to fear,\" said Lena Chan, Director of the National Biodiversity Centre at the National Parks Board in Singapore. \"In fact, they play a vital role as pollinators and are a delight to observe.\" While many Malaysians and Singaporeans welcomed the moths with open arms, sharing their encounters and photographs online, others remained cautious, citing cultural beliefs such as the Chinese superstition that moths symbolize death and should not be disturbed.",
    "The Madagascar pochard, a critically endangered duck species, is on the brink of extinction due to human activity. According to a study published in Bird Conservation International, only 25 individual birds remain in the wild, confined to a single wetland in north-east Madagascar. The Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust (WWT), which led the research, estimates that 96% of the chicks die at just two to three weeks old due to starvation.\n\nThe wetland, a complex of lakes near Bemanevika, lacks sufficient food for the ducks, which feed from the bottom of lakes. Despite the efforts of conservationists, including the WWT, the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, and the Peregrine Fund, the population continues to decline. Dr. Geoff Hilton, head of species research at the WWT, notes that with such a small number of birds, monitoring the population is straightforward, but the results are devastating.\n\nThe researchers have identified the problem: the steep crater lake is too deep for the diving ducks, and the chicks are starving to death. This is a classic wildlife conservation conundrum, where the last refuge of a species is not suitable for its needs, but is the only place that has not been destroyed by human activities.\n\nHowever, there is hope. The captive-bred ducks could thrive in Madagascar again if a new wetland home can be found. The researchers have identified a potential reintroduction site and are working with local people to restore the lake and reintroduce the pochard. Dr. Hilton emphasizes that the key to success lies in working with the local community to restore the lake and improve their livelihoods.",

    "Hywel Dda University Health Board is proposing to adjust the operating hours of the paediatric ambulatory care unit (PACU) at Withybush Hospital to ensure safe and consistent care for children. Due to a shortage of consultant paediatricians, the health board recommends reducing the unit's daily hours by four hours. This change would see the PACU open from 10:00 to 18:00 GMT, instead of the current 10:00 to 22:00 GMT.\n\nThe PACU provides essential care to children experiencing sudden illnesses or injuries, including high temperatures, infections, and those requiring dressings, blood tests, or imaging services. If the proposal is approved, children requiring assessment outside of the new operating hours would be transferred to Glangwili Hospital in Carmarthen.\n\nThe health board attributes the need for this change to the ongoing challenge of recruiting paediatric consultants nationwide, exacerbated by the recent retirement of a local paediatric consultant and another's maternity leave. Doing nothing, the health board warns, would pose a significant risk to patient safety and public confidence.\n\nTo further mitigate the impact, the health board suggests merging the on-call rota with the one in Carmarthenshire. This would enable paediatric consultants to provide remote advice in emergency situations, ensuring timely and effective care.\n\nAccording to Steve Moore, the health board's chief executive, \"We must be pragmatic about our consultant availability and plan care accordingly to ensure safety, consistency, and avoid public confusion. Otherwise, we risk unplanned closures, compromising patient safety and public trust.\" The health board continues to actively recruit paediatric consultants to address the shortage.",

    "Four sailors, James Male, Andrew Bridge, Steve Warren, and Paul Goslin, tragically lost their lives when their yacht, Cheeki Rafiki, capsized in the North Atlantic. Prosecutors at Winchester Crown Court allege that Douglas Innes, the yacht's manager, failed to ensure the vessel was properly inspected before its ill-fated trip. Innes, 42, denies four counts of manslaughter by gross negligence and an additional charge of failing to ensure the yacht was operated safely. The court heard that the yacht had been given a category 2 code, limiting its commercial use to within 60 miles of a safe haven, but the certificate had expired shortly before the tragedy. The sailors were returning from Antigua Sailing Week to Southampton when the yacht overturned in May 2014. According to prosecutor Nigel Lickley QC, Innes received an urgent email from Andrew Bridge on board the yacht but failed to call the coastguard, instead going to another pub. When Bridge called again, saying the situation had worsened, Innes returned home, contacted the coastguard, and emailed the crew to check the keel bolts. Tragically, it was later discovered that several bolts had failed or broken, causing the keel to detach from the yacht. The court was told that the keel's loss would have resulted in a rapid capsize, with those on deck being thrown into the water and those inside trapped. Emergency beacons used by Bridge and Male suggest they may have survived for some time in the water before being lost. The US Coastguard initially called off its search after two days, but following protests and government intervention, it was restarted, and the yacht was eventually found. The trial is ongoing.",

It's a great club that trusts its players, and I'm determined to make a good impression.\"\n\nUnlike Llorente, a veteran of Spain's 2010 World Cup and Euro 2012-winning teams, Borja has yet to receive a senior call-up for his country. However, he draws inspiration from former Swansea striker Michu, who earned a cap for Spain after a successful season with the club.

This landmark case serves as a stark reminder that modern-day slavery is a harsh reality, and it's up to us to eradicate it from our society.\n\nAs the Crown's national lead prosecutor for human trafficking, Kath Harper, stated, \"Human trafficking can take many forms, and we are committed to doing everything in our power to eradicate it from Scotland.\" Independent anti-slavery commissioner Kevin Hyland added, \"This case is a clear example of modern-day slavery, and I commend the victims for their courage in seeking justice.\"\n\nThe authorities have sent a strong message that such heinous crimes will not be tolerated, and those responsible will be brought to justice. But the fight against modern-day slavery is far from over, and it's up to us to remain vigilant and work together to protect the vulnerable and bring perpetrators to account.",
    "The proposed London Paramount resort, located on the Swanscombe Peninsula near Dartford, would be massive, covering an area twice the size of the Olympic Park. It would feature 5,000 hotel rooms and a water park. Before submitting a formal application, the developers need to conduct further research on traffic and environmental concerns. If approved, the resort is now expected to open in 2021, rather than the original target of Easter 2020. The 900-acre site, currently a brownfield area, would be transformed into a theme park with over 50 rides and attractions inspired by movies and TV shows. According to David Testa, CEO of London Paramount, the company is taking extra time to refine its application to ensure a successful submission.",
    "Tiger Woods, a 14-time major champion, made his return to competitive golf after a 15-month hiatus, during which he underwent two surgeries. He finished nine strokes behind leader JB Holmes, also from the US, at the event he hosts to benefit his charitable foundation. Woods, 40, had a mixed round, with four birdies in eight holes, but struggled with a wayward drive and poor chip on the ninth hole, resulting in a bogey. He dropped another shot on the 11th, and double bogeys on the 16th and 18th left him one stroke over par. Despite this, Woods expressed optimism, saying he \"felt pretty good\" and was \"looking forward to the next few days.\" He acknowledged making mistakes, including hitting the ball into three bushes and the water, but was encouraged by his solid start. Woods attributed his struggles to not driving well, which made it difficult to take advantage of the course. His double bogeys came from a pulled approach shot on the 16th and a drive into a lake on the 18th. Woods had briefly tied for the lead at four under par after a strong start, but his late mistakes cost him. Holmes leads the 18-man event with an eight-under-par 64, featuring seven birdies and an eagle. Hideki Matsuyama of Japan is a shot behind, with Dustin Johnson, Henrik Stenson, Matt Kuchar, and Louis Oosthuizen tied for fourth on five under. Justin Rose, playing his first event after a seven-week break, finished last on two over par.",

    "Austria's Freedom Party, led by Heinz Christian Strache, has filed a legal challenge to the presidential election results, citing numerous irregularities, including the handling of postal votes. Strache emphasized that the party's actions are not driven by sour grapes, but rather a commitment to protecting democratic foundations. The party's candidate, Norbert Hofer, lost to Alexander Van der Bellen by a margin of 31,000 votes. The constitutional court has four weeks to respond to the challenge, with a decision potentially coming just two days before Van der Bellen's scheduled inauguration. \n\nThe Freedom Party's 150-page submission alleges that postal ballots were illegally handled in 94 of 117 district election offices, potentially affecting over 570,000 ballots. Additionally, the party claims to have evidence of under-16s and foreigners voting. Strache stated that the extent of the irregularities is \"terrifying\" and that without them, Hofer could have won the presidency. \n\nThe constitutional court will need to determine whether the law was broken and if any breaches would have impacted the election outcome. Possible outcomes include a partial recount or a fresh vote in affected areas. The challenge threatens to reignite divisions sparked by the election, which exposed deep differences in Austria and Europe over the migrant crisis, economy, and national interests versus EU interests.",
    "In a bid to modernize its governance structure, a report has proposed separating the roles of head of the legal system and president of the States in Jersey. This unique dual role, where the same person both makes and interprets the law, is a peculiarity exclusive to the Channel Islands.\n\nAccording to Dr. Adrian Lee, a political expert, this arrangement is unheard of in democratic jurisdictions worldwide. The Carswell Committee, which authored the report, recommends that the Bailiff of Jersey should relinquish their role as president of the States and be replaced by an elected speaker.\n\nLord Carswell, the committee's chair, emphasized that international constitutional documents discourage judges from being involved in lawmaking. Moreover, the increasing demands of States work have been taking a toll on the Bailiff's time, making it a practical necessity to split the roles.\n\nDr. Lee, a former professor of politics, highlighted the importance of clarity in Jersey's governance structure, particularly as the island develops its international presence. Currently, there is ambiguity about who represents the island - the Chief Minister, the Lieutenant Governor, the Bailiff, or all three.\n\nGuernsey, which shares a similar governance structure, is watching the developments in Jersey with interest. The Guernsey States Assembly and Constitution Committee plans to discuss the report at their next meeting. The spotlight on the dual role of the bailiffs was triggered by Sark's decision to separate the roles of seneschal, its chief judge and president of Chief Pleas, following external pressure.",

    "On Wednesday, three Americans were flown out of Sanaa, Yemen's capital, which is controlled by the Houthi rebel movement. The Oman government assisted in their release at the request of the US government.

Earlier this month, an American contractor for the United Nations died in detention after being arrested at Sanaa's airport. In September, two Americans, a British citizen, and three Saudis were freed from Houthi captivity and flown to safety in Oman. \n\nThe Houthi rebels, who ousted Yemen's government from Sanaa this year, are facing a multinational coalition led by Saudi Arabia and backed by the US.

    "Get Ready for Liftoff! Inmarsat's Latest Satellite Launch\n\nAfter a brief delay, Inmarsat's third Global Xpress platform is finally set to launch on August 28 from Baikonur, Kazakhstan. The launch was put on hold due to a review of the Russian Proton rocket, which experienced a failure in May while carrying a Mexican payload.\n\nInmarsat is the world's largest mobile satellite services operator, providing vital telecommunications to the shipping sector, oil and gas installations, aviation, armed forces, aid agencies, and even TV news crews reporting from disaster zones. Their new £1bn GX network is the biggest commercial UK space project, designed to offer seamless coverage worldwide.\n\nThe upcoming launch will complete the network over the Pacific, giving customers fast and reliable connections no matter where they are. This is especially important for the shipping and aviation sectors, which rely on Inmarsat's services to stay connected.\n\nSo, what caused the Proton rocket's failure in May? Investigators discovered that natural vibrations in the rocket's third stage loosened bolts, leading to a chain reaction that ultimately caused the engine to shut down. But don't worry - measures are in place to prevent this from happening again.\n\nDespite the Proton rocket's recent issues, Inmarsat is confident in its return to flight. In fact, the company's Chief Technical Officer, Michele Franci, believes that the extra caution and controls in place make this launch the best one to be on.\n\nThe new satellite is insured, and Inmarsat has taken the extra precaution of ordering a fourth platform from Boeing, just in case. This will be available in mid-2016.\n\nInmarsat's Global Xpress network marks a significant step into Ka frequencies, offering faster broadband speeds - 100 times faster than their previous generation of spacecraft! While the delay has been frustrating, it's allowed the company to iron out network issues, making the final product even more stable and reliable.\n\nStay tuned for the launch on August 28, and follow me on Twitter @BBCAmos for the latest updates!",

    "A massive 100MW renewable energy project is being planned for the Glenmuckloch site near Kirckconnel, which could generate power for over a century. The project, a pumped storage hydro scheme, is part of a larger effort to redevelop the former opencast mine into the Glenmuckloch Energy Park. The plan involves creating two reservoirs connected by a tunnel with a pump-turbine, which will store excess energy by pumping water from the lower reservoir to the upper one, and then release it to generate power when needed. The project is a collaboration between Buccleuch Estates, Hargreaves, and 2020 Renewables, and is expected to create 3.3 million cubic meters of water storage. The redevelopment of the site follows the collapse of a previous mining company, and is part of a larger effort to restore the area.

    "East Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust, which operates Conquest Hospital in Hastings and Eastbourne District General Hospital, is currently rated as \"inadequate\" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC). According to sources, the trust has failed to demonstrate significant improvement and is likely to be placed under special measures during a meeting scheduled for Friday. The trust has declined to comment, citing the forthcoming publication of a CQC report.\n\nNotably, East Kent Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and Medway NHS Foundation Trust are already under special measures. Medway's Maritime Hospital recently had to divert ambulances to alleviate pressure on its Accident and Emergency department.\n\nThe East Sussex trust received an \"inadequate\" rating from the CQC in March, following its failure to meet government targets. Subsequently, in May, Eastbourne Borough Council passed a vote of no confidence in the trust's management. Furthermore, in July, the chief executive resigned, and the trust issued an apology after patients' personal details were found in a public area.\n\nThe CQC's March report highlighted a \"disconnect between the trust board and its staff\" and a \"culture of fear\" that discouraged staff from speaking out. Despite widespread awareness of the trust's challenges, tangible progress towards improvement has been lacking. It is understood that the CQC believes little has changed in recent months.\n\nFriday's meeting will provide an opportunity for stakeholders to discuss the trust's future direction. However, many within the NHS community expect special measures to be imposed on the trust. When approached for comment, a trust spokesperson stated, \"We are awaiting the publication of the CQC report next week and will refrain from making any further comment until the report is published and any recommendations are made.\"",
    "A former student of Haggerston Girls' School in Hackney, east London, Lisa Doughty, 47, has been diagnosed with mesothelioma. She believes her illness may be linked to asbestos exposure during her time at the school in the 1980s. Doughty recalls the music desks being frequently covered in dust, which may have contained asbestos particles. She spent a significant amount of time in the music room each week, rehearsing plays, and remembers having to wipe off white dust from the desks. The room's heavy doors would constantly slam, causing the room to shake, and Doughty suspects that the dust may have come from the ceiling.\n\nIf it is proven that the music room was the cause of her cancer, Doughty fears that many others may have been affected. She is urging anyone else who has been impacted, including former pupils and teachers, to come forward. Doughty's lawyers, Slater and Gordon, have discovered that asbestos ceiling tiles were present in the school during her time there and are considering further legal action.\n\nA Hackney Council spokesperson acknowledged that asbestos was widely used in buildings, including Haggerston School, due to its fire-resistant properties. The school has undergone regular condition and asbestos surveys and removals. Edmund Young, an asbestos-related disease specialist, notes that mesothelioma is increasingly affecting not only industrial workers but also teachers and former students who have inhaled asbestos particles while at school.",

    "In the heart of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), a sea of passionate students has gathered near the main administrative block. The air is electric with slogans like \"Free Kanhaiya Kumar\" and \"Long live revolution\" as hundreds of agitated students pour into the area. At the center of the controversy is Kanhaiya Kumar, the leader of the university's student union, who has been accused of sedition and arrested by the police.\n\nThe students are adamant that Kumar is innocent and that the police's actions were unjustified. They claim that Kumar did not organize the event commemorating Afzal Guru's hanging, where \"anti-India slogans\" were allegedly raised. In fact, many students are willing to defend Kumar, but only on condition of anonymity, fearing for their safety.\n\nStudent activist Shreya Ghosh reveals the climate of fear that pervades the university. \"We've been sleeping in different rooms every night to avoid arrest,\" she says. Another activist, Deepshita, believes that ideological politics is behind Kumar's arrest, with right-wing students seeking to increase their influence on campus.\n\nAs the protest gains momentum, speakers become more vociferous in their criticism of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP party. Professor Ajith Kanna takes the stage, declaring, \"If Kanhaiya is anti-national, then I am also anti-national.\" He urges the students to remain peaceful and not to believe rumors, which are spreading like wildfire across the campus.\n\nOne such rumor claims that over 100 armed right-wing activists have infiltrated the campus. I meet Saurabh Kumar, a member of the right-wing student group Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), who insists that the law will decide Kumar's guilt or innocence, but that anti-India activities will not be tolerated on campus.\n\nNot all students, however, are caught up in the protests.

Both possess an undeniable charm that elevates them above the ordinary and makes them truly exceptional. Singapore, in particular, has become the go-to destination for business deals, rivaling Monaco as the premier hub for networking during a grand prix weekend. Its allure is undeniable, making it one of the most coveted races on the calendar. The atmosphere is electric, and it's not just the thrill of racing on one of the longest and most challenging tracks in F1 that draws in the crowds. Singapore's unique blend of Asian and colonial heritage makes it a fascinating destination in its own right. The nighttime race adds an extra layer of excitement, with the track weaving through the city center under the glow of lights, Chinese lanterns adding a pop of color, and the futuristic skyline serving as a stunning backdrop. As the sun dips below the horizon, the entire city seems to come alive, shimmering and sparkling with an otherworldly energy. The tropical heat is tempered by the darkness, replaced by a lush, exotic atmosphere that envelops the entire area. For those working behind the scenes, the experience is nothing short of surreal.

Drones, remotely controlled pilot-less aircraft, are being used by police to capture footage in hard-to-reach areas, such as cliffs. However, there are concerns that criminals are also exploiting this technology. In one instance, a drone was used to smuggle contraband into HMP Manchester, and there have been nine reported attempts to infiltrate prisons in England and Wales using drones. Additionally, a think tank has warned of the potential for terrorist groups to utilize drones. The UK Air Proximity Board has also reported four serious near-miss incidents involving drones at UK airports.\n\nThe proposed solution involves training birds of prey to take down drones, which they would perceive as prey. However, experts have raised concerns about the feasibility and safety of this approach. Jemima Parry-Jones, director of the International Centre of Birds of Prey, has dismissed the idea as a \"gimmick,\" citing the risks to both humans and birds.

    "In 2013, an innovative initiative was launched to boost employment and enhance the image of Porlock Bay by establishing oyster beds off its coast. Fast forward to today, and the project has achieved remarkable success. The farmed shellfish have secured the highest quality rating, earning a prestigious Class A classification for cleanliness. This achievement is a testament to the hard work and dedication of the Porlock Futures Community Interest Company, which spearheaded the trial.\n\nThe project's success is attributed to the use of oysters from Morecambe Bay in Lancashire, which were used to test the feasibility of farming shellfish in the seas around Porlock.

    "**Arizona Bill Sparks Controversy Over Transgender Rights**\n\nA heated debate on a bill in Arizona's Republican-dominated legislature was halted on Wednesday due to protests from transgender activists. The bill, which would make it a misdemeanor offense to use a public toilet or facility associated with a gender other than what is listed on one's birth certificate, has sparked outrage among transgender rights advocates.\n\n**Background**\n\nLast month, Arizona approved a human rights measure banning gender identity discrimination at public facilities. Meanwhile, two other states have passed laws ensuring equal access to gender-segregated facilities for transgender students.\n\n**The Bill's Provisions**\n\nIf passed, the bill would impose penalties of up to six months in prison for violators. Supporters of the bill, such as Republican lawmaker John Kavanagh, argue that it is necessary to prevent criminals from taking advantage of the situation and exposing themselves to children of the opposite gender.\n\n**Critics Speak Out**\n\nHowever, transgender rights advocates argue that the bill would force transgender people to reveal themselves and risk harassment. \"Most transgender people try to slip through public places without being noticed,\" said activist Erica Keppler. \"This will turn us into criminals.\"\n\n**Challenges in Changing Birth Certificates**\n\nAdvocates also point out that transgender people often face difficulties in changing their gender on their birth certificates, as many states require proof of gender treatment surgery. In some states, such as Idaho and Ohio, it is not possible to change one's birth certificate at all.\n\n**National Context**\n\nCurrently, 16 US states have laws in place to protect transgender people from discrimination, although the extent of these protections varies. A case in Colorado, where a six-year-old transgender girl was banned from using the girl's bathroom at her primary school, is ongoing.\n\n**Quote from Transgender Rights Lawyer**\n\n\"If you look like a man and you live your life like a man, you should be able to use a man's bathroom,\" said Dru Levasseur, a transgender rights lawyer for Lambda Legal.",

    "Gorka Marquez, a professional dancer on the BBC's Strictly Come Dancing, recently underwent dental surgery following an unfortunate incident in Blackpool. According to reports, Mr. Marquez was assaulted by a group of youths while walking to a nightclub with colleagues on Saturday evening. As a result, two of his lower front teeth were severely chipped.\n\nA spokesperson for the BBC confirmed that Mr. Marquez was the victim of an unprovoked attack, which occurred as he was exiting a vehicle. The assailants, described as a random group of individuals, fled the scene shortly after the incident.\n\nDespite the severity of the attack, Mr. Marquez has chosen not to file a formal complaint with the authorities.

    "The pupils of Newington Church of England Primary School in Sittingbourne, ranging in age from four to 11, were informed of a simulated refugee scenario during a Friday assembly. The school has acknowledged that this exercise was not discussed with parents or senior staff prior to its implementation. The activity was part of a week-long educational program focused on raising awareness about refugees.\n\nIn a statement, the school explained: \"Our intention was to create a scenario that would facilitate empathy among our students towards those we were raising funds for. Moving forward, all activities of this nature will be reviewed and approved by a member of the senior leadership team prior to implementation. We will only consider and approve options that enable students to empathize and understand without causing undue stress and anxiety.\"\n\nThe school has acknowledged that the message could have been conveyed in a more suitable manner and has extended apologies to both parents and students. The school was participating in Christian Aid's Refugee Week, a charity for which they have previously fundraised. Christian Aid has stated: \"We have limited information regarding the specifics of what was communicated to the pupils during the assembly, but we do not recommend any teaching approaches that may cause unnecessary distress to children.\"",
    "A 67-year-old man suffered a broken collarbone after being knocked to the ground outside his home in Gateshead in January. An online appeal set up by beautician Katie Cutler raised an astonishing £330,135. Richard Gatiss, 25, from Gateshead, pleaded guilty to assault with intent to rob and was sentenced at Newcastle Crown Court. The victim, Mr. Barnes, felt the four-year sentence was appropriate and hoped Gatiss would use his time in prison to reflect on his actions. \"I hope he'll take this opportunity to think about what he's done and come out a better person, maybe even decide to help others,\" Mr. Barnes said. The court heard that Gatiss, desperate for money to buy legal highs, targeted Mr. Barnes due to his vulnerabilities. Mr. Barnes has lived with disabilities since birth and is visually impaired and only 4ft 6in tall. Judge Paul Sloan QC condemned Gatiss' actions as \"despicable and opportunistic.\" After the hearing, Mr. Barnes, accompanied by Miss Cutler, expressed relief at the sentence and hoped Gatiss would reform. Miss Cutler, holding back tears, wished for Gatiss to receive the help he needed. The defense argued that the publicity surrounding the case made it challenging to determine a fair sentence. Gatiss' father called for a ban on legal highs, while Northumbria Police welcomed the sentence, saying it would deter criminals from targeting vulnerable individuals.",
    "In the first half of August, nearly 4,000 migrants arrived in Quebec, seeking a safe haven and a chance to rebuild their lives. Many of them are Haitians who fear persecution if they remain in the US. Government officials are working hard to correct misinformation that may have led them to Canada's doorstep.\n\nAfter the devastating earthquake in Haiti in 2010, nearly 60,000 Haitians were granted temporary protection in the US. Although the Trump administration extended this protection until January 2018, Canada lifted its own protected status for Haitians last year. Unfortunately, about half of all asylum claims by Haitians were rejected in 2016.\n\nTo address the influx of migrants, federal officials are spreading the word that crossing the border irregularly is not a guarantee of residency. Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale emphasized that \"people should not think that border-hopping is a desirable or productive thing to do.\" Immigration Minister Ahmed Hussen added that Canadian diplomatic staff in the US are working to dispel myths about Canada's asylum system, including the misconception that residency is guaranteed.\n\nTo reach out to the Haitian community, federal Liberal MP Emmanuel Dubourg, who is of Haitian origin and speaks Creole, is engaging with Haitian media in American cities like Miami and New York. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also addressed the issue, saying, \"Canada is an open and welcoming society, but we are also a country of laws. Entering Canada irregularly is not an advantage. There are rigorous immigration and customs rules that will be followed.\"\n\nDespite criticism from opposition politicians, Canadian officials are committed to providing a fair and compassionate response to the influx of migrants. Since January, 7,500 migrants have crossed into Canada, with the majority entering Quebec. To process their claims, the federal government has increased staff in the region, but there is currently a five-month wait.",
    "A recent study conducted by a team from University College London has revealed a concerning lack of knowledge among paediatricians in England and Wales regarding the identification of underweight children and the associated serious complications. Despite most respondents having experience in treating children with eating disorders, the study found that many paediatricians were uncertain about how to identify underweight children and detect potential life-threatening complications.\n\nThe research, which involved surveying paediatricians at 177 hospitals, discovered that only half of the respondents would use Body Mass Index (BMI) to determine if older children or adolescents were underweight, as recommended by international guidelines. Furthermore, only one in five would adjust the BMI cut-offs for children. The study also highlighted a lack of awareness among paediatricians regarding the signs and symptoms of complications in children with severely low weights.\n\nThe researchers expressed particular concern that only 13% of paediatricians knew to look for a specific danger sign in tests checking heart function, and that many scored poorly on knowledge of dangerous complications associated with refeeding malnourished patients.\n\nStudy leader Dr. Lee Hudson emphasized that the findings were not intended to criticize paediatricians, but rather to highlight a gap in training. He noted that eating disorders often present with vague symptoms, making it essential for paediatricians to be equipped with the necessary knowledge to identify and manage these conditions effectively.\n\nDr. Hudson stressed that paediatricians are often the first point of contact for children with eating disorders, particularly outside of regular working hours, and therefore need to be able to recognize the signs of dangerous underweight and severe complications. He cited previous research indicating that a third of underweight children present with life-threatening features.\n\nIn response to the study's findings, the Royal College of Paediatrics has acknowledged the need for improved training in eating disorders and underweight issues. Prof. Russell Viner, a co-author of the study and member of the Royal College of Paediatrics Nutrition Committee, announced that the college is refreshing its training on adolescent health and developing a training program on mental health in adolescents in collaboration with the Department of Health and the Royal College of Psychiatry.",
    "In a groundbreaking move, China has announced that couples will now be allowed to have two children, marking a significant shift away from the country's decades-long one-child policy. This change is expected to bring a more balanced approach to population growth, addressing concerns about an aging population and shrinking workforce.\n\nIntroduced in 1979, the one-child policy was initially designed to slow down population growth, and it's estimated to have prevented around 400 million births. However, over time, the policy has been criticized for its strict enforcement, which included fines, job losses, and even forced abortions for those who violated the rules.\n\nAs China's population continues to age - with around 30% of its 1.36 billion citizens now over 50 - the government has recognized the need for change. By allowing couples to have two children, the Communist Party aims to promote a more sustainable population growth rate and address the social and economic challenges that come with an aging population.\n\nWhile this move is seen as a step in the right direction, some critics argue that it may not be enough to boost the birth rate significantly. Others point out that the state's control over women's fertility remains a concern, even with the relaxed rules.\n\nPersonal stories of those affected by the one-child policy highlight the emotional toll it has taken on families. For instance, one woman shares how her mother had to undergo two abortions due to the policy, and how she still wonders about the siblings she never had.\n\nExperts like Stuart Gietel-Basten, associate professor of social policy at the University of Oxford, see this reform as a pragmatic response to an unpopular policy that was no longer effective. The announcement comes as part of the Communist Party's fifth plenum, which also outlined growth targets and the country's next five-year plan.\n\nOverall, this shift in policy marks a significant turning point for China, as it seeks to find a more balanced approach to population growth and address the challenges of an aging population.",
    "James Anderson, the world's top-ranked Test bowler, is expected to miss Lancashire's next two County Championship games due to a stress fracture in his right shoulder blade. The injury occurred during the third Test against Sri Lanka. Anderson's absence comes at a crucial time, as England prepares to face Pakistan in a four-match series starting on July 14 at Lord's.\n\nDespite the setback, Anderson's recent performance in the Test series against Sri Lanka was impressive, taking 21 wickets across three matches, including 10 in the opening win at Headingley. His outstanding performance propelled him to the top of the International Cricket Council bowling rankings, surpassing teammate Stuart Broad.\n\nAnderson's availability for the Pakistan Test series will be determined by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) and Lancashire's medical teams, who will continue to monitor and manage his recovery. This is not the first time Anderson has faced injury setbacks, having missed two Tests in the 2015 Ashes series with a side strain and the first Test against South Africa in December with a calf problem.\n\nLancashire has expressed its support for Anderson, wishing him a speedy recovery and hoping to see him back in action soon. In the meantime, Durham all-rounder Ben Stokes, who recently returned to competitive action after a knee injury, could potentially replace Anderson in the team.",

    "British Gas and EDF have announced price cuts of 5.1% and 5%, respectively, following similar reductions by other major energy suppliers. The moves, which take effect in mid-March, will benefit customers on standard domestic gas tariffs. The cuts come after a 57% drop in wholesale gas prices over the past year, prompting calls for suppliers to pass on savings to customers. While the reductions are welcome, critics argue that they don't go far enough, with some customers still able to save up to £300 by switching to fixed deals. Additionally, electricity tariffs remain unchanged despite falling wholesale costs, with suppliers citing increased environmental costs and network charges. The industry is awaiting the outcome of a competition watchdog investigation, which may shed light on whether consumers are getting a fair deal.",

    "What a thrilling day of cricket! Machan and Wells put on an incredible show, racking up 134 runs for the second wicket before Machan's impressive 81 was finally brought to an end by Ravi Patel's clever bowling. Wells soon followed, but not before scoring a solid 61. Then, Yardy took center stage, smashing 70 runs at Lord's to help Sussex reach a respectable 300 all out, giving them a crucial 66-run lead. Middlesex fought back, with Sam Robson racing to 41 not out, but they still trail by 19 runs. The worn pitch made Machan's knock all the more remarkable, and Yardy and Wells' more measured approaches paid off. Patel's introduction to the attack was a game-changer, as he quickly dispatched Machan, Wells, Nash, and Brown. Just when it seemed like Middlesex were taking control, Sussex launched a stunning fightback, thanks to Ashar Zaidi's 38-run partnership with Yardy, followed by a vital 40 from Yardy and Ollie Robinson. James Harris eventually wrapped up the Sussex tail, but not before Yardy and Robinson had given their team a real chance. The match is now perfectly poised, with Middlesex's batsmen facing a thrilling challenge to catch up before the end of the game!",

Despite Mr. Corbyn's claims of building a \"mass movement\" capable of winning a general election, Mr. Smith dismissed this as \"delusional\" and accused the current leader of abandoning his commitment to \"straight, honest politics\".\n\nWith Labour's poll ratings at an all-time low, Mr. Smith painted a dire picture of the party's future, warning that it could be left with as few as 140 MPs if it continued on its current \"disastrous trajectory\".

    "\"The Fed's Verdict: Economy on the Upswing, But Rates Remain on Pause\"\n\nIn a unanimous decision, the US central bank has given the economy a thumbs-up, declaring that it's gaining momentum. \"The economy is humming along, with moderate growth in recent months,\" the Fed announced in a statement. While the job market, housing, and consumer spending are all looking up, the bank is still playing it cool, refusing to give a clear timeline for when interest rates will rise.\n\nThe Fed's policymakers are optimistic that inflation will gradually creep up to its 2% target, and they're encouraged by the job market's solid gains, which have brought unemployment down to a seven-year low of 5.3%. But they're not ready to pull the trigger on a rate hike just yet, insisting that they need to see more improvement in the labor market and inflation before making a move.\n\nThe decision to keep interest rates at rock-bottom levels for now was widely expected, but analysts are still betting on a rate hike in September. \"The Fed is taking baby steps towards an increase,\" says Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Funds. And with the interest rate stuck at a record low for six and a half years, the anticipation is building.\n\nThe Fed's chair, Janet Yellen, has emphasized that any rate hike will be data-driven and gradual, and most analysts agree that September is the most likely time for the first increase.

    "**Landmark Ruling Exposes Illegal Data Collection by UK Spy Agencies**\n\nIn a major blow to the UK's intelligence agencies, a campaign group has won a significant victory in a long-running battle over data collection. Privacy International has been fighting against the practices of GCHQ, MI5, and MI6, and a recent ruling has confirmed that some of their data collection methods were unlawful.\n\nThe Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT) found that the spy agencies' collection of communications data, including who, where, when, and with whom individuals communicated, violated the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). This data is crucial for identifying intelligence targets, but the ECHR states that all citizens have the right to a private life and that any interference with personal data must be lawful and necessary.\n\nThe ruling is a major embarrassment for the government, as it reveals that much of the data collection was carried out under an outdated law that failed to provide adequate safeguards. \"The laws that govern what the agencies can and can't do shouldn't be secret,\" said Graham Smith, a lawyer at Bird & Bird. \"Everyone accepts that operational secrets are necessary, but the laws themselves should be transparent.\"\n\nHowever, the IPT also acknowledged that the government has since taken steps to address these concerns. In February 2015, a new policy was introduced to ensure that data collection is carried out lawfully, and the intelligence agencies have since implemented these changes.\n\nWhile the government has welcomed the ruling, Privacy International has hailed it as a \"highly significant judgment\" that highlights the need for greater transparency and stronger safeguards. The Home Office has pledged to provide greater transparency and stronger safeguards for bulk data collection powers, but campaigners will be watching closely to ensure that these promises are kept.\n\nThis landmark ruling has significant implications for the balance between national security and individual privacy, and it's a major victory for those fighting to protect our human rights.",

Rodgers described the club's unbeaten streak as \"incredible,\" but he is cognizant of the challenges that lie ahead in their pursuit of an undefeated season. \"I believe the unbeaten record is extremely difficult to maintain,\" he said. \"We have nine games remaining, and the last five will be played against top-six teams, making it even more challenging. In terms of the treble, we rarely discuss it. We must stabilize our emotions and focus on performing well. We strive to win every game we play, and for the remainder of the season, we will push ourselves as hard as we have all season. I believe the team is improving with each game they play together.\"",
    "Tragedy struck in November 2013 when 33-year-old Terry Smith, a local father, died in hospital just a day after being detained under the Mental Health Act in Surrey. The events leading up to his death are now under scrutiny. After being arrested in Stanwell at 10pm on November 12, 2013, following a call for assistance from an ambulance crew, Smith was taken to Staines police station where he was restrained. He later fell ill and was rushed to St Peter's hospital in Chertsey, where he sadly passed away the next day. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) has launched an investigation into the circumstances surrounding Smith's death, focusing on the methods used to detain him and why he was kept in restraints at the police station. The investigation has implicated eight police officers and two staff members, with two sergeants (one of whom has since retired) and a contracted health worker facing potential charges of gross negligence manslaughter and misconduct in public office. The IPCC has referred the case to the Crown Prosecution Service to determine whether criminal charges will be brought against any of the individuals involved. IPCC Commissioner Jennifer Izekor expressed her condolences to those affected by Smith's death, saying, \"My thoughts remain with everyone affected by Mr Smith's death.\"",

    "Courts in Stirling, Kilmarnock, and Dundee had a significantly higher rate of imprisoning women, with nearly 20% of female defendants receiving jail sentences, compared to 7% in Edinburgh and 5% in Airdrie. Retired Sheriff Peter Gillam, who served from 1991 to 2013, attributed these disparities to the independence of the judiciary. According to Gillam, while a sentencing advisory board exists, each judge brings their unique perspective and approach to decision-making. He emphasized that a degree of uniformity is maintained through the Appeal Court, which corrects any egregious sentencing decisions. However, Gillam believes that it would be misguided to impose strict uniformity on the judiciary, as local knowledge and individualized consideration are essential to fair sentencing. Ultimately, he advocates for trusting judges to make informed decisions based on their expertise and full understanding of each case.",
    "A 25-year-old cricketer tragically died from a brain hemorrhage two days after being struck on the neck during a match in Sydney on November 25, 2014. A five-day inquest was held to investigate whether his death could have been prevented. During the hearing, some players were accused of dishonesty for claiming they couldn't remember key events from that day. The inquest, which began on Monday at the New South Wales Coroner's Court, heard testimony from players including Brad Haddin, Doug Bollinger, and David Warner. The court examined whether the deceased, Phillip Hughes, was targeted with short-pitch bowling or received intimidating comments from opponents while batting for South Australia in a Sheffield Shield game against New South Wales. Questions were also raised about whether a bowler threatened Hughes before the fatal injury. Hughes' parents walked out of the inquest after the family's counsel, Greg Melick SC, criticized the players for repeatedly claiming they had \"no recollection\" or \"couldn't recall\" key events. Melick argued that there was a plan to target Hughes with short-pitched balls, which increased the risk of injury. The counsel representing Cricket Australia and its players denied allegations of fabricated evidence. The coroner, Michael Barnes, will deliver his findings on November 4. A previous report commissioned by Cricket Australia recommended making protective helmets compulsory for batsmen facing fast- and medium-paced bowling, but concluded that even the newest safety-standard helmets would not have saved Hughes' life.",
    "Following mediation efforts by the South Sudanese government, 19 individuals have been released from captivity. This marks the first group to be freed since the cross-border raid on April 15, in which approximately 125 children were abducted. The attack was perpetrated by members of the Murle community, who have been previously accused of stealing livestock and children to raise as their own.\n\nThe raid, which resulted in the deaths of over 200 individuals from the rival Nuer community in Ethiopia's western Gambella province, prompted Ethiopian forces to cross into South Sudan and encircle the villages where the children were being held. However, through diplomatic negotiations between South Sudanese officials and the abductors, the children were freed without incident, according to the Ethiopian News Agency.\n\nNegotiations are set to continue in an effort to secure the release of all remaining children. As stated by South Sudan's Ambassador to Ethiopia, James Pitia Morgan, \"It is imperative that the children are rescued and reunited with their families, and that the stolen cattle are returned to their rightful owners.\"\n\nThe long-standing border between Ethiopia and South Sudan has historically been prone to cross-border raids involving the Murle and Nuer communities. However, the scale of the April 15 attack has sparked widespread shock and outrage in both countries, leading to protests in Ethiopia's Gambella region, where parents are demanding greater protection for their children. In response, Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn has condemned the raid, attributing it to \"primitive and destructive forces.\"",
    "Priyanka Yoshikawa, a 22-year-old elephant trainer and newly crowned Miss Japan, has vowed to challenge prevailing attitudes with her historic win. Last year, Ariana Miyamoto broke ground as the first mixed-race winner of the Miss Universe pageant, sparking controversy among critics who believed a \"pure\" Japanese winner was more deserving. In Japan, where only about 2% of births are to biracial parents, Yoshikawa's victory has reignited the debate over identity and belonging.\n\n\"We are Japanese,\" Yoshikawa asserted in an interview with AFP. \"My father is Indian, and I'm proud of my heritage. But that doesn't diminish my Japanese identity.\" She credited Miyamoto with paving the way for mixed-race women like herself, saying, \"Before Ariana, haafu girls couldn't represent Japan. She showed us that it's possible.\"\n\nYoshikawa's own experiences with prejudice have made her a strong advocate for greater acceptance. \"When I returned to Japan, people treated me like an outcast,\" she recalled. \"But that only made me stronger.\" Her win has drawn criticism from some quarters, with some arguing that her Indian heritage makes her less Japanese. However, many have rallied around her, including Indians who have taken to social media to urge the Japanese to be more open-minded.\n\nThe backlash against Yoshikawa echoes the abuse faced by Nina Davuluri, an Indian-American who was crowned Miss America in 2014. Davuluri was subjected to racist and xenophobic attacks on Twitter, prompting widespread outrage and support from the Indian community.\n\nIn both cases, the criticism seems to center on the notion of \"purity\" – the idea that a person's identity must conform to certain racial or ethnic standards. However, as one Twitter user astutely observed, \"Talent cannot be controlled or ruled by caste, color, gender, or country of origin.\"\n\nYoshikawa, an avid kick-boxer and qualified elephant trainer, hopes to use her platform to challenge these outdated attitudes. \"When I'm abroad, people never ask me about my mixed heritage,\" she said. \"As Miss Japan, I hope to change perceptions so that it's the same here too.\" Despite the criticism, Yoshikawa remains undeterred, saying, \"I've lived in Japan for so long now, I feel Japanese. And I'm proud to represent my country.\"",

The organization has announced its intention to appeal the decision, according to reports. The court has stipulated a six-month deadline for the Church to cease its operations, as mandated by the ministry. Founded in 1954 by renowned science fiction author L.

    "Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has stated that it is \"impossible\" for senior party members to remain in their positions if they defy a three-line whip and vote against the Article 50 bill. This comes after Shadow Welsh Secretary Jo Stevens resigned last week over the issue, and other senior MPs have threatened to rebel. Corbyn has instructed all Labour MPs to support the bill, despite the party's initial campaign to remain in the EU and many Labour MPs representing constituencies that voted to remain. However, many Labour MPs also represent areas that voted to leave the EU. Corbyn acknowledges the pressure on MPs in pro-Remain constituencies but urges them to unite on key issues. Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott argues that it would be undemocratic for MPs to vote against the bill, given the UK-wide referendum result. Several Labour MPs, including Tulip Siddiq and Daniel Zeichner, have announced their intention to vote against the bill, while Labour whips Jeff Smith and Thangam Debbonaire have also said they will rebel. Corbyn emphasized that it is impossible to remain in the shadow cabinet if one votes against the party's decision. Deputy leader Tom Watson has suggested that some rebels could be reinstated to senior roles within months. The Article 50 bill is set to be debated by MPs on Tuesday and is expected to clear the Commons by February 8. Labour is pushing for changes, including a Commons vote on the final Brexit deal, while the Liberal Democrats and SNP have vowed to oppose the bill unless certain conditions are met.",
    "Daniel Sturridge suffered a setback after entering the game as a second-half substitute at St James' Park, with a scan revealing a strain. This latest injury is just the latest in a string of absences for the 26-year-old, who had only recently returned to action following knee and foot issues. So far this season, Sturridge has made six appearances, scoring four goals. In the 2013-14 season, he netted 28 times for Liverpool and England, but was limited to just 18 appearances last season due to thigh, calf, and hip injuries. After undergoing hip surgery in May, Sturridge played in three games at the start of this term, but then didn't feature again until 29 November. He scored twice in the 6-1 League Cup quarter-final win over Southampton last Wednesday, but was injured at Newcastle after coming on in the 62nd minute. When a foot problem forced him to miss the Reds' Europa League win over Bordeaux on 26 November, Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp stated that Sturridge needed to learn \"what is serious pain and what is only pain\". With seven games on the horizon until the first leg of their League Cup semi-final at Stoke on 5 January, Liverpool, currently eighth in the Premier League, will be hoping for a swift recovery from their injured striker.",
    "You might remember the horrific case of a 14-year-old girl who was gang-raped and murdered in Indonesia. It was a wake-up call for the country, and President Joko Widodo proposed some big changes to the laws in May. The idea was to get tougher on sex offenders, but it sparked a heated debate in parliament. Two opposition parties voted against one of the most controversial proposals: chemical castration.\n\nHuman rights groups were quick to speak out against the punishments, saying that violence won't solve the problem of violence. The Indonesian Doctors Association also weighed in, saying that administering chemical castration would go against their professional ethics. The procedure involves injecting convicts with female hormones, and it's already used in some countries like Poland, South Korea, and Russia.\n\nBut that's not all - the new laws also give judges the option to sentence paedophiles to death or tag them electronically, and they introduce a minimum 10-year sentence for child sex crimes. Not everyone is on board, though. Human rights groups like the National Commission for Women (NCW) are calling for the laws to be reviewed every year to see if they're actually making a difference. Azriana, the head of the NCW, points out that other countries that have tried chemical castration haven't seen a drop in sexual crimes against kids. Plus, it's a pricey procedure - wouldn't it be better to invest in services that support victims?\n\nOn the other hand, Dr Yohana Susana Yembise, Indonesia's Minister for Women Empowerment and Child Protection, is hoping that the harsh punishments will have the desired effect. She says, \"We've got the toughest punishments on the books now: the death penalty, life in prison, chemical castration, public shaming, and electronic tagging. Love it or hate it, everyone needs to get on board.\"\n\nThese changes come after a string of high-profile child sexual abuse cases in Indonesia. Last year, a British-Canadian teacher and an Indonesian were jailed for 10 years for abusing kids at a Jakarta kindergarten. And just a few months ago, a nine-year-old girl was found murdered in a cardboard box in Jakarta after being repeatedly sexually assaulted. It's clear that something needs to be done to tackle this problem, but the question is: will these new laws really make a difference?",
    "A 17-year-old from the Netherlands or Belgium died in a bungee jumping accident in Spain. The teenager was staying at a surf camp and was participating in a type of bungee jump called \"puenting\" from a bridge in Cantabria, northern Spain. Unfortunately, the teenager fell 130 feet into a dry riverbed below and died.\n\nThis is the second bungee jumping death in Spain this summer. Last month, a British tourist died after hitting a bridge wall during a bungee jump in southern Spain.\n\nThe police are investigating the latest accident and think it might have been caused by carelessness, but they're not sure what went wrong. The type of bungee jump the teenager was doing, \"puenting\", involves diving with two cords attached and then swinging under the bridge.\n\nBungee jumping has become very popular in Spain, especially in rural areas with beautiful scenery. However, it can be dangerous, and there have been around 10 deaths related to bungee jumping in Spain since the 1980s.\n\nThe local police chief said he didn't know that \"puenting\" was happening on the bridge and thinks it's extremely risky. The mayor of the area expressed her condolences to the teenager's family and offered to help them in any way she can.",
    "Archaeologists employed by the National Trust for Scotland (NTS) have made a significant discovery at Culzean Castle in South Ayrshire, uncovering a previously unknown walled enclosure beneath the lawn in the Fountain Court. According to NTS, this enclosure likely served as a kitchen garden from approximately 1733 to 1782. Consistent with the architectural trends of the late 18th century, a new walled garden was subsequently constructed out of sight from the castle, allowing the original site to be landscaped to enhance the views from the property.\n\nDerek Alexander, Head of Archaeological Services for NTS, commented, \"Despite being marked on the estate map, we were unaware that any remnants of the original structure had survived beneath the immaculately manicured lawn of the Fountain Court. This project has provided a unique opportunity to explore a previously hidden aspect of Culzean's history. Once the lawn is re-seeded, I suspect the gardeners will be reluctant to permit further excavations!\"\n\nHistorical records suggest that the garden was established as part of a broader renovation project undertaken by Sir John Kennedy of Culzean, 2nd Baronet, in 1733. The garden is depicted on an estate map of Culzean created by John Foulis in 1755. The site was eventually abandoned in 1782, and the walls were demolished by Robert Adam's workmen as part of a comprehensive series of improvements to the castle. The ongoing drainage works at Fountain Court aim to render the area suitable for hosting large-scale public events.",
    "Get ready to celebrate a major milestone! In March, we reached an incredible landmark - nine whole months ahead of schedule! This achievement is the culmination of decades of tireless global efforts and investment to bring life-saving antiretroviral drugs to those who need them most, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nSince the UN set its sights on combating HIV in 2000, the progress has been nothing short of remarkable. Back then, fewer than 700,000 people had access to these vital medicines. Fast forward to today, and we've made huge strides! According to UN Aids' latest report, our collective efforts have prevented a staggering 30 million new HIV infections and nearly 8 million Aids-related deaths since the millennium. That's right, folks - we've saved millions of lives!\n\nThe numbers are astounding: new HIV infections have plummeted from 2.6 million per year to 1.8 million, and Aids-related deaths have dropped from 1.6 million to 1.2 million. And the best part? Global investment in HIV has skyrocketed from £3.1bn ($4.8bn) in 2000 to a whopping £13bn ($20bn) in 2014!\n\nBut here's the most exciting part: if we keep up the momentum and work together over the next five years, we can actually end the Aids epidemic by 2030! That's right, we can make HIV a thing of the past.\n\nOf course, there's still work to be done. We need to bridge the gap in awareness of HIV status, which remains the biggest barrier to treatment access. And we must continue to improve treatment access for children, who have historically lagged behind adults in receiving antiretroviral therapy.\n\nBut despite these challenges, the progress we've made is undeniable. And with the switch to the Sustainable Development Goals, we have a unique opportunity to finish what we started. As Ban Ki-moon, Secretary General of the United Nations, so aptly put it: \"The world has delivered on halting and reversing the Aids epidemic. Now we must commit to ending the Aids epidemic as part of the Sustainable Development Goals.\"\n\nSo let's keep pushing forward, shall we? The next five years will be critical, and with front-loaded investment, we can \"sprint\" towards our goal of ending the Aids epidemic by 2030. The finish line is in sight - let's make it happen!",

Sales volumes also saw a 0.7% increase, slightly lower than the UK's 0.8%. Over the past year, sales volumes in Scotland rose by 2.7%, while values only increased by 0.1%. David Lonsdale, director of the Scottish Retail Consortium, welcomed the return to growth but noted that consumer confidence remains fragile, affecting retailers. He urged the next Scottish government to prioritize policies that promote investment and expansion in the sector. Lonsdale emphasized that the retail industry's prospects depend on the economy and their ability to adapt, and that the new government can help by supporting the industry, Scotland's largest private-sector employer. Euan Murray of Barclays Corporate Banking in Scotland attributed the modest 0.7% increase in sales volume to food sales, and noted that non-food retailers are benefiting from strong online offerings, which are becoming increasingly important. Recent industry figures showed a mixed performance in March, with total sales down 1.3% compared to the same period last year.

Despite his experience in 14 Grands Prix, including a ninth-place finish in Japan on Sunday, Verstappen admitted to feeling pressure during the test, having only started driving lessons a week prior. He expressed relief at passing, stating, \"I was a bit nervous about making mistakes, but the exam went well.\" As an added benefit of turning 18, Verstappen can now legally drink champagne if he secures a podium finish."
