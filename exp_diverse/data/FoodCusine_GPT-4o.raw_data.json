    "I have bought several of the Vitality canned dog food products and have found them all to be of good quality. The product looks more like a stew than a processed meat and it smells better. My Labrador is finicky and she appreciates this product better than  most.",
    "Product arrived labeled as Jumbo Salted Peanuts...the peanuts were actually small sized unsalted. Not sure if this was an error or if the vendor intended to represent the product as \"Jumbo\".",
    "This is a confection that has been around a few centuries.  It is a light, pillowy citrus gelatin with nuts - in this case Filberts. And it is cut into tiny squares and then liberally coated with powdered sugar.  And it is a tiny mouthful of heaven.  Not too chewy, and very flavorful.  I highly recommend this yummy treat.  If you are familiar with the story of C.S. Lewis' \"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe\" - this is the treat that seduces Edmund into selling out his Brother and Sisters to the Witch.",
    "If you are looking for the secret ingredient in Robitussin I believe I have found it.  I got this in addition to the Root Beer Extract I ordered (which was good) and made some cherry soda.  The flavor is very medicinal.",
    "Great taffy at a great price.  There was a wide assortment of yummy taffy.  Delivery was very quick.  If your a taffy lover, this is a deal.",
    "I got a wild hair for taffy and ordered this five pound bag. The taffy was all very enjoyable with many flavors: watermelon, root beer, melon, peppermint, grape, etc. My only complaint is there was a bit too much red/black licorice-flavored pieces (just not my particular favorites). Between me, my kids, and my husband, this lasted only two weeks! I would recommend this brand of taffy -- it was a delightful treat.",
    "This saltwater taffy had great flavors and was very soft and chewy.  Each candy was individually wrapped well.  None of the candies were stuck together, which did happen in the expensive version, Fralinger's.  Would highly recommend this candy!  I served it at a beach-themed party and everyone loved it!",
    "This taffy is so good.  It is very soft and chewy.  The flavors are amazing.  I would definitely recommend you buying it.  Very satisfying!!",
    "Right now I'm mostly just sprouting this so my cats can eat the grass. They love it. I rotate it around with Wheatgrass and Rye too",
    "This is a very healthy dog food. Good for their digestion. Also good for small puppies. My dog eats her required amount at every feeding.",
    "I don't know if it's the cactus or the tequila or just the unique combination of ingredients, but the flavour of this hot sauce makes it one of a kind!  We picked up a bottle once on a trip we were on and brought it back home with us and were totally blown away!  When we realized that we simply couldn't find it anywhere in our city we were bummed.<br /><br />Now, because of the magic of the internet, we have a case of the sauce and are ecstatic because of it.<br /><br />If you love hot sauce..I mean really love hot sauce, but don't want a sauce that tastelessly burns your throat, grab a bottle of Tequila Picante Gourmet de Inclan.  Just realize that once you taste it, you will never want to use any other sauce.<br /><br />Thank you for the personal, incredible service!",
    "One of my boys needed to lose some weight and the other didn't.  I put this food on the floor for the chubby guy, and the protein-rich, no by-product food up higher where only my skinny boy can jump.  The higher food sits going stale.  They both really go for this food.  And my chubby boy has been losing about an ounce a week.",
    "My cats have been happily eating Felidae Platinum for more than two years. I just got a new bag and the shape of the food is different. They tried the new food when I first put it in their bowls and now the bowls sit full and the kitties will not touch the food. I've noticed similar reviews related to formula changes in the past. Unfortunately, I now need to find a new food that my cats will eat.",
    "good flavor! these came securely packed... they were fresh and delicious! i love these Twizzlers!",
    "The Strawberry Twizzlers are my guilty pleasure - yummy. Six pounds will be around for a while with my son and I.",
    "My daughter loves twizzlers and this shipment of six pounds really hit the spot. It's exactly what you would expect...six packages of strawberry twizzlers.",
    "I love eating them and they are good for watching TV and looking at movies! It is not too sweet. I like to transfer them to a zip lock baggie so they stay fresh so I can take my time eating them.",
    "I am very satisfied with my Twizzler purchase.  I shared these with others and we have all enjoyed them.  I will definitely be ordering more.",
    "Twizzlers, Strawberry my childhood favorite candy, made in Lancaster Pennsylvania by Y & S Candies, Inc. one of the oldest confectionery Firms in the United States, now a Subsidiary of the Hershey Company, the Company was established in 1845 as Young and Smylie, they also make Apple Licorice Twists, Green Color and Blue Raspberry Licorice Twists, I like them all<br /><br />I keep it in a dry cool place because is not recommended it to put it in the fridge. According to the Guinness Book of Records, the longest Licorice Twist ever made measured 1.200 Feet (370 M) and weighted 100 Pounds (45 Kg) and was made by Y & S Candies, Inc. This Record-Breaking Twist became a Guinness World Record on July 19, 1998. This Product is Kosher! Thank You",
    "Candy was delivered very fast and was purchased at a reasonable price.  I was home bound and unable to get to a store so this was perfect for me.",
    "My husband is a Twizzlers addict.  We've bought these many times from Amazon because we're government employees living overseas and can't get them in the country we are assigned to.  They've always been fresh and tasty, packed well and arrive in a timely manner.",
    "I bought these for my husband who is currently overseas. He loves these, and apparently his staff likes them also.<br />There are generous amounts of Twizzlers in each 16-ounce bag, and this was well worth the price. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GVISJM\">Twizzlers, Strawberry, 16-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)</a>",
    "I can remember buying this candy as a kid and the quality hasn't dropped in all these years. Still a superb product you won't be disappointed with.",
    "I have lived out of the US for over 7 yrs now, and I so miss my Twizzlers!!  When I go back to visit or someone visits me, I always stock up.  All I can say is YUM!<br />Sell these in Mexico and you will have a faithful buyer, more often than I'm able to buy them right now.",

    "The candy is just red , No flavor . Just  plan and chewy .  I would never buy them again",
    "I was so glad Amazon carried these batteries.  I have a hard time finding them elsewhere because they are such a unique size.  I need them for my garage door opener.<br />Great deal for the price.",
    "I got this for my Mum who is not diabetic but needs to watch her sugar intake, and my father who simply chooses to limit unnecessary sugar intake - she's the one with the sweet tooth - they both LOVED these toffees, you would never guess that they're sugar-free and it's so great that you can eat them pretty much guilt free!  i was so impressed that i've ordered some for myself (w dark chocolate) to take to the office so i'll eat them instead of snacking on sugary sweets.<br />These are just EXCELLENT!",

    "I have never been a huge coffee fan. However, my mother purchased this little machine and talked me into trying the Latte Macciato. No Coffee Shop has a better one and I like most of the other products, too (as a usually non-coffee drinker!).<br />The little Dolche Guesto Machine is super easy to use and prepares a really good Coffee/Latte/Cappuccino/etc in less than a minute (if water is heated up). I would recommend the Dolce Gusto to anyone. Too good for the price and I'am getting one myself! :)",
    "This offer is a great price and a great taste, thanks Amazon for selling this product.<br /><br />Staral",
    "McCann's Instant Oatmeal is great if you must have your oatmeal but can only scrape together two or three minutes to prepare it. There is no escaping the fact, however, that even the best instant oatmeal is nowhere near as good as even a store brand of oatmeal requiring stovetop preparation.  Still, the McCann's is as good as it gets for instant oatmeal. It's even better than the organic, all-natural brands I have tried.  All the varieties in the McCann's variety pack taste good.  It can be prepared in the microwave or by adding boiling water so it is convenient in the extreme when time is an issue.<br /><br />McCann's use of actual cane sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup helped me decide to buy this product.  Real sugar tastes better and is not as harmful as the other stuff. One thing I do not like, though, is McCann's use of thickeners.  Oats plus water plus heat should make a creamy, tasty oatmeal without the need for guar gum. But this is a convenience product.  Maybe the guar gum is why, after sitting in the bowl a while, the instant McCann's becomes too thick and gluey.",
    "This is a good instant oatmeal from the best oatmeal brand.  It uses cane sugar instead of high fructouse corn syrup, so not only does it have a better sweetness, but some doctors now say that this form of sugar is better for you.  Great on a cold morning when you don't have time to make McCann's Steel Cut Oats.  The apple cinnamon is the best but the maple and brown sugar or the regular are good too.  Plus they don't require doctoring to actually tell the three flavors apart.",
    "Instant oatmeal can become soggy the minute the water hits the bowl. McCann's Instant Oatmeal holds its texture, has excellent flavor, and is good for you all at the same time. McCann's regular oat meal is excellent, too, but may take a bit longer to prepare than most have time for in the morning. This is the best instant brand I've ever eaten, and a very close second to the non-instant variety.<br /><br />McCann's Instant Irish Oatmeal, Variety Pack of Regular, Apples & Cinnamon, and Maple & Brown Sugar, 10-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)",
    "McCann's Instant Irish Oatmeal, Variety Pack of Regular, Apples & Cinnamon, and Maple & Brown Sugar, 10-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)<br /><br />I'm a fan of the McCann's steel-cut oats, so I thought I'd give the instant variety a try. I found it to be a hardy meal, not too sweet, and great for folks like me (post-bariatric surgery) who need food that is palatable, easily digestible, with fiber but won't make you bloat.",
    "For those of us with celiac disease this product is a lifesaver and what could be better than getting it at almost half the price of the grocery or health food store!  I love McCann's instant oatmeal - all flavors!!!<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Abby",
    "What else do you need to know? Oatmeal, instant (make it with a half cup of low-fat milk and add raisins;nuke for 90 seconds). More expensive than Kroger store brand oatmeal and maybe a little tastier or better texture or something. It's still just oatmeal. Mmm, convenient!",
    "I WAS VISITING MY FRIEND NATE THE OTHER MORNING FOR COFFEE , HE CAME OUT OF HIS STORAGE ROOM WITH ( A PACKET OF McCANNS INSTANT IRISH OATMEAL .) HE SUGGESTED THAT I TRY IT FOR MY OWN USE ,IN MY STASH . SOMETIMES NATE DOSE NOT GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO SAY NO , SO I ENDED UP TRYING THE APPLE AND CINN . FOUND IT TO BE VERY TASTEFULL WHEN MADE WITH WATER OR POWDERED MILK . IT GOES GOOD WITH O.J. AND COFFEE AND A SLICE OF TOAST AND YOUR READY TO TAKE ON THE WORLD...OR THE DAY AT LEAST..

    "The variety packs taste great!<br /><br />I have them every morning. At $0.30 cents per meal, I don't understand why everyone on earth isn't buying this stuff up.<br /><br />Maple and brown sugar is terrific, followed by apples and cinnamon, followed by regular. You don't get tired of the same ole thing, and they taste great.<br /><br />I just boil water from a small pot, empty the packet or 2 in a bowl, pour in boiling water, and watch it expand to 2x its size!<br /><br />Taste really good and takes minutes to prepare.<br /><br />Not sure why everyone on earth isn't this. Convenient, healthy, very quick, excellent quality, and extremely cheap...",
    "McCann's makes oatmeal for every oatmeal connoisseur, whether one likes it from the raw pellet state that cooks for half an hour, to the sloth addled instant, which can be done in the microwave for under three minutes. It's all good, that's for sure, and the beauty of the instant variety is that it is available in different flavors as well as regular.<br />  This variety pack allows different tastes to be explored, as well as giving you a chance to experience the difference between McCann's and other well-known oatmeals. What I personally like about McCann's is that it cooks up thicker and with more body than the top brand here in America. The Apples & Cinnamon, though, tends to be a little liquidy so you may want to experiment with the amount of water you add. In my 1300watt microwave the oatmeal cooks up in about one minute and twenty-seven seconds, so you should also watch that to get a handle on how much time and water to use.<br />  The only bad thing -- if you can consider it a bad thing -- about this offering is that you have to buy in lot so you'll end up with six ten-count boxes. This is good if you have a whole family of oatmeal-eaters, but if you're a single person alone -- well, love oatmeal.",
    "I have McCann's Oatmeal every morning and by ordering it from Amazon I am able to save almost $3.00 per box.<br />It is a great product. Tastes great and very healthy",
    "McCann's Oatmeal is a good quality choice.  Our favorite is the Apples and Cinnamon, but we find that none of these are overly sugary.  For a good hot breakfast in 2 minutes, this is excellent.",
    "We really like the McCann's steel cut oats but find we don't cook it up too often.<br />This tastes much better to me than the grocery store brands and is just as convenient.<br />Anything that keeps me eating oatmeal regularly is a good thing.",
    "This seems a little more wholesome than some of the supermarket brands, but it is somewhat mushy and doesn't have quite as much flavor either.  It didn't pass muster with my kids, so I probably won't buy it again.",
    "Good oatmeal.  I like the apple cinnamon the best.  Though I wouldn't follow the directions on the package since it always comes out too soupy for my taste.  That could just be me since I like my oatmeal really thick to add some milk on top of.",
    "The flavors are good.  However, I do not see any differce between this and Oaker Oats brand - they are both mushy.",
    "I really like the Maple and Brown Sugar flavor. The regular is fine with brown sugar added. The Apples and Cinnamon flavor is OK. This is a very quick, easy and satisfying breakfast and I'll order this brand again, but not the variety. I'll get all Maple and Brown Sugar.",
    "This is the same stuff you can buy at the big box stores.  There is nothing healthy about it.  It is just carbs and sugars.  Save your money and get something that at least has some taste.",
    "This oatmeal is not good. Its mushy, soft, I don't like it. Quaker Oats is the way to go.",
    "Got a free package of these with a bottle of bloody mary mix I bought from the seller, and the advertising worked..lol,  I tried them, and shared them with 2 buddies, and we all loved them...  So im here to buy more, and noticed there were no reviews yet,...  well now there is.  They are Hot,  but not \"burn your mouth forever hot\"  its a nice temp...  Perfect for us..",
    "This wasn't in stock the last time I looked. I had to go to the Vermont Country Store in Weston to find it along with a jaw harp, Cranberry Horseradish Sauce, Fartless Black Bean Salsa, Apple Cider Jelly, Newton's Cradle Art in Motion and the staple Vermont Maple Syrup.<br /><br />Back to the Ass Kickin Peanuts. They are hot. They will activate the perspiration glands behind your ears and under your arms. It requires a beverage as advertised, a glass of very cold milk, and a box of Kleenex since it will make your nose run. They look like ordinary peanuts which is already giving me ideas for work. I suspect that some people have been hitting my goodies in my absence, especially my colleague Greg. I'm going to take this to work at earliest opportunity and empty the contents of this can into an ordinary Planters Peanuts can, and then see whose crying or whose nose is running when I return.<br /><br />The can should be shaken to ensure the spices are evenly distributed. It is important to wash your hands after consumption and not touch the eyes.<br /><br />You'll go nuts over these Ass-Kickin' Peanuts.<br /><br />P.S. I'm not sharing the peanuts, not deliberately, and I'll probably give Greg the jaw harp for Christmas. He'll be so insulted.",
    "we're used to spicy foods down here in south texas and these are not at all spicy.  doubt very much habanero is used at all.  could take it up a notch or two.",
    "I roast at home with a stove-top popcorn popper (but I do it outside, of course). These beans (Coffee Bean Direct Green Mexican Altura) seem to be well-suited for this method. The first and second cracks are distinct, and I've roasted the beans from medium to slightly dark with great results every time. The aroma is strong and persistent. The taste is smooth, velvety, yet lively.",
    "We roast these in a large cast iron pan on the grill (about 1/3 of the bag at a time).  The smell is wonderful and the roasted beans taste delicious too.  More importantly, the coffee is smooth; no bitter aftertaste.  On numerous occasions, we've had to send the roasted beans home with friends because they like it so much.",
    "Deal was awesome!  Arrived before Halloween as indicated and was enough to satisfy trick or treaters.  I love the quality of this product and it was much less expensive than the local store's candy.",
    "It is chocolate, what can I say.  Great variety of everything our family loves.  With a family of six it goes fast here.  Perfect variety.  Kit Kat, Reeses, take five and more.",
    "Great product, nice combination of chocolates and perfect size!  The bags had plenty, and they were shipped promptly.  The kids in the neighborhood liked our candies!",
    "Halloween is over but, I sent a bag to my daughters class for her share. The chocolate was fresh and enjoyed by many.",
    "Watch your prices with this.  While the assortment was good, and I did get this on a gold box purchase, the price for this was<br />$3-4 less at Target.",
    "This bag of candy online is pretty expensive, it should be cheaper in order to compete with grocery stores, other than that, its a good combination of my favorite candy",
    "Arrived in 6 days and were so stale i could not eat any of the 6 bags!!",
    "I have used the endurolyte product for several years in both pill and powder form.  Long desert rides on the dirt bike always found my camelbak water heavily laced with the endurolyte powder, not overly tasty, but quite effective, as I never got a cramp on these several hundred mile rides.  Same for desert racing in the buggy, the camelbaks were always laced with the powder.  Now we have the Fizz...what a great product!  Firstly, its Hammer's endurolyte product so it's great, endurance athlete's the world over use their products. Second its convenient, handly tablets that dissovle in a fizz.  Third it tastes great! Imagine getting a nice cool drink when your body is starving for hydration and electrolytes and rather than getting a \"salty\" taste, you get a refreshing lemon-lime or mango!  The camelbaks always get the Fizz now.  I also drop a tablet in my bottled water whenever I exercise and have a nice flavored water chock full of electrolytes. I cannot recommend this product or any hammer product highly enough.",
    "This product serves me well as a source of electrolytes during and after a long run or bike ride.<br />I have tried all of the flavors but really do like the grapefruit flavor... no after-taste and I actually like the slight carbonation.<br />I use other Hammer products and really like their whole product line.",
    "This stuff really works for preventing cramping during the middle to latter stages of your rides. Pop 1 into each water bottle and you're set. Flavor is fine and goes down easy.",
    "For those of us on a low carb diet these little tablets are just the thing.<br /><br />Two years ago I started cycling again after many years but was having heart arrhythmia after longer rides in high heat.  I was drinking plain water but did a little research and thought electrolytes might be the issue.  Gatorade wasn't an option because it is so loaded with carbohydrates so I looked around for a low-carb alternative.  The \"zero carb\" sports drinks didn't help so what to do?  One day I ran across these at my bike shop so tried a tube of them.....voila!...problem solved!!<br /><br />I've shared them with two friends in particular whose problems with leg cramps were resolved while using these.<br /><br />These guys got it right -- they are superbly formulated and simply work.....",
    "I purchased the Mango flavor, and to me it doesn't take like Mango at all.  There is no hint of sweetness, and unfortunately there is a hint or aftertaste almost like licorice.  I've been consuming various sports nutrition products for decades, so I'm familiar and have come to like the taste of the most of the products I've tried.  The mango flavor is one of the least appealing I've tasted.  It's not terrible, but it's bad enough that I notice the bad taste every sip I take.",
    "If you're impulsive like me, then $6 is ok. Don't get me wrong, the quality of these babies is very good and I have no complaints. But in retrospect, the price is a little ridiculous (esp. when you add on the shipping).",
    "this was sooooo deliscious but too bad i ate em too fast and gained 2 pds! my fault",
    "These Albanese gummi bears and rings and so on are very good and tasty and high quality. The bears even have little faces. At my local candy store this type of gummi stuff (bears, rings, snakes, balls, worms, whatever) are about $10/lb. These twin packs of 4.5 or 5 pound bags is a screaming deal as far as I'm concerned. I'm probably 50 pounds deep in these friggin' things. Consumed!",
    "Grape gummy bears are hard to find in my area. In fact pretty much anyone I talk to about grape gummy bears they think I'm lying. So I bought 10lbs... : ) These bears are a little bit bigger then the other brands and have kind of sour kick, but nothing to strong. I love grape flavored candy/soda and these are pretty good. There is another company that makes grape gummy bears that are a little bit better in my opinion, but these are well worth it for the price. I like to use the gummy bears in home made Popsicles with flavored sports drink. The salt in the sports drink makes for softer popsicles, and the gummy bears are awesome frozen. They are delicious!",
    "I ordered two of these and two of raspberry latice tarts directly from FantasiCakes website for a dinner party I was hosting. It arrived fresh and intact. Very good size. I froze half for later use. I am a pastry lover and these were the best I've ever tasted. The pastry was soft, the jam was really good and the taste was great. They were gone in no time. My guests were really impressed.",
    "Buyer Beware Please! This sweetener is not for everybody.  Maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body.  You will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience. Nausea, diarrhea & headaches can also be experienced. I learned my lesson the hard way years ago when I fell in love with the sugar-free chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell.  I thought I'd found sugar-free chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in.  The discomfort was unlike anything I had ever felt before.  I blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping.  As the symptoms passed, this too was very unpleasant.  Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit, all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate. My hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when I purchased some delicious sugar-free popcorn at my local market.  The taste was amazing and while I was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy, new sugarfree treat taste so good, my heart sank when I followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener* down to the very bottom of the label and read \"maltitol\" in tiny little letters! Thank goodness I'd eaten only a little. I still ended up with all the same side-effects but for a much shorter duration. Some people can use maltitol to their heart's content but others, like me, can have a bad reaction to it. In case you're like me, ... it's not you ...it's the maltitol!",
    "It is okay.  I would not go out of my way to buy it again",
    "No tea flavor at all. Just whole brunch of artifial flavors. It is not returnable. I wasted 20+ bucks.",
    "These looked like a perfect snack to through in with my trail mix.  Unfortunately, they arrived in a solid mass of melted chocolate.  I left them in my pantry for a few days, and when I opened them at room temperature they were still gooey.  I through them in the fridge and I've been breaking off hunks ever since.  They taste good to me, but the chocolate is all grainy after melting and then solidifying again.  I won't order them online again, but if I see them in a store I would pick them up.",
    "These taste really good. I have been purchasing a different brand and these are very similar in taste and texture. I agree with the other reviewer regarding ordering in the summer. There is no insulating packaging with ice packs so they will melt in warm weather like all chocolate food items. Order in cold weather and buy enough to last!!!",
    "The taste was great, but the berries had melted.  May order again in winter. If you order in cold weather you should enjoy flavor.",
    "i know i cannot make tea this good.  granted, i am not from the south but i know i have never enjoyed tea that was this sweet without being too sweet.  it tastes crisp.",
    "This peppermint stick is delicious and fun to eat.  My dad got me one for Christmas because he remembered me having a similar one when I was a little girl.  I'm 30 now and I love it!",
    "Great gift for all ages! I purchased these giant canes before and the recipients loved them so much, they kept them and would not eat them.",
    "I know the product title says Molecular Gastronomy, but don't let that scare you off.  I have been looking for this for a while now, not for food science, but for something more down to earth.  I use it to make my own coffee creamer.<br /><br />I have to have my coffee blonde and sweet - but the flavored creamers are full of the bad kinds of fat, and honestly, I hate to use manufactured \"food\" items.  I really don't think they are good for the body.  On the other hand, I hate using cold milk or cream, because I like HOT coffee.<br /><br />I stumbled across this on Amazon one day and got the idea of making my own creamer.  I also bought low-fat (non-instant) milk powder and regular milk powder. The non-instant lowfat milk is a little sweeter and tastes fresher than regular instant low-fat milk, but does not dissolve good in cold water - which is not a problem for hot coffee.  You will have to play with the ratios - I would not do just the heavy cream, it made the coffee too rich. Also, I think the powder is too expensive to just use on it's own. I like mixing 1/3 of each together.<br /><br />For flavoring, I bough cocoa bean powder, vanilla bean powder, and caster (superfine) sugar.  I mix up small batches along with spices like cinnamon and nutmeg to make my own flavored creamers.  If you wanted, you could use a fake sweetner powder instead.  I make up small amounts that I store in jelly canning jars. I also use my little food chopper/food processor to blend everything, so the sugar is not heavier and sinks to the bottom.  Let it settle for a bit before opening the top though.<br /><br />This stuff tastes WAY better than the storebought creamers and it is fun to experiment and come up with your own flavors.  I am going to try using some essential oils next and see if I can get a good chocolate/orange mix.<br /><br />All of the ingredients I mentioned are here online.  Take the time to experiment.  Maybe you don't use any low-fat milk. Or don't add any flavorings.  It is up to you.  Also, would make great housewarming/host(ess) gifts.<br /><br />I am sure other molecular people will be able to tell you more of what you can do with it, and I am sure I will experiment with it in cooking - but the main reason I bought it was to make my own creamer and it worked out great.",
    "While my dogs like all of the flavors that we have tried of this dog food, for some reason their itching increased when I tried the lamb and rice. I have some very itchy dogs and am giving them a limited ingredient dog food to try to help. The duck and sweet potato cut down on the itching significantly, but when we tried lamb and rice they started itching more once again. I like Natural Balance for the quality ingredients.",
    "Awesome dog food. However, when given to my \"Boston\", who has severe reactions to some food ingredients; his itching increased to violent jumping out of bed at night, scratching. As soon as I changed to a different formula, the scratching stopped. So glad Natural Balance has other choices. I guess you have to try each, until you find what's best for your pet.",
    "We have three dogs and all of them love this food!  We bought it specifically for one of our dogs who has food allergies and it works great for him, no more hot spots or tummy problems.<br />I LOVE that it ships right to our door with free shipping.",
    "My dog has a ton of allergies both environmental and food. She was on a prescription dog food before we had her tested to see what allergies she has. After we got the test back, we learned she was allergic to something in the prescription brand. So I finally found this dog food and she has done so well on this! She still has her environmental triggers, but I am happy she can finally eat something I know won't cause her pain.",
    "My shepherd/collie mix has IBS.  Our vet recommended a limited ingredient food.  This has really helped her symptoms and she likes it.  I will always buy it from Amazon...it's $10 cheaper and free shipping!",
    "Natural Balance Dry Dog Food Lamb Meal and Brown Rice Recipe did wonders for my Jack Russell. She has awful food allergy's and this food was our last hope because it was the last food we could find that didn't have SOMETHING in it that she was allergic to. She has no problem eating it dry but normally I mix the Natural Balance Dry Lamb and Brown Rice with the Natural Balance Wet Lamb and Brown Rice.. she seems to like that better. We started feeding it to our other dog (a Bichon) too and she loves it. If your dog has allergy's or stomach issue.. or if you want your dog to eat better food-- this is it! You will see a difference in your pet.",
    "Great food! I love the idea of one food for all ages & breeds. Ît's a real convenience as well as a really good product.  My 3 dogs eat less, have almost no gas, their poop is regular and a perfect consistency, what else can a mom ask for!!",
    "I have a standard poodle and pomeranian who both do wonderful on this food. I have switched them to a different food (due to price) a couple of times and end up going right back to natural balance.",
    "This is great dog food, my dog has severs allergies and this brand is the only one that we can feed him.",
    "This food is great - all ages dogs.  I have a 3 year old and a puppy.  They are both so soft and hardly ever get sick.  The food is good especially when you have Amazon Prime shipping  :)",
    "My golden retriever is one of the most picky dogs I've ever met.  After experimenting with various types of food, I have found she loves natural balance.  What I really like about natural balance is the fact that it has multiple flavors in dry and wet varieties.  I mix her dry food with a little wet food and my golden loves it.  Furthermore, I do like mixing up the flavors each time as I think the same meal day over day might get a little boring, so I figured why not.  I tend to stay away from the fish type though as it smells...<br /><br />Additionally, I started purchasing off Amazon because Petco didn't have the wet food box and only had a couple of cans.  I came home and to my surprise realized that I could save $20 each time I bought dog food if I just buy it off Amazon.<br /><br />All in all, I definitely recommend and give my stamp of approval to natural balance dog food.  While I have never eaten it, my dog seems to love it.",
    "This is the same food we get at pet store. But it's delivered to my door! And for the same price or slightly less.",
    "I've been very pleased with the Natural Balance dog food. Our dogs have had issues with other dog foods in the past and I had someone recommend Natural Balance grain free since it is possible they were allergic to grains. Since switching I haven't had any issues. It is also helpful that have have different kibble size for larger/smaller sized dogs.",
    "My 1-1/2 year old basenji/jack russell mix loves this dog food. He's been noticeably healthier and more energetic since I switched him over from the standard dog foods earlier this year. Despite the higher cost of natural dog foods, I find that he eats significantly less of the Natural Balance dog foods and still stays happy and full. On the normal dog foods, he'd eat up to 3 cups of dog food a day (the recommended serving for his size), whereas he only eats about 1 cup to 1-1/2 cup of the Natural Balance dog food a day. When you take this into account, you're actually getting more \"bang for your buck\" with the natural dog foods since you don't have to buy as much to last just as long as the normal dog foods... and a healthier, happier dog, to boot! Add in the fact that you can get free, 2-day shipping with Amazon Prime... I'm sold!!",
    "Our pup has experienced allergies in forms of hotspots and itching from other dog foods. The cheap 'you can buy it anywhere' food not only have crazy preservatives in them but can cause health problems for your pets.  This food works wonders on reducing allergies and our dog loves the food.<br />This message is RAMSEY FrAnkenSteiN approved.",
    "My English Bulldog had skin allergies the summer we got him at age 3.  The vet recommended we wean him off the food his previous owner gave him (Iams Lamb and Rice) and onto a new kind.  This was the second one we tried, and it has been working ever since.  It's for dogs that need a limited diet who can be sensitive to additives and proteins commonly found in commercial dog food (like chicken or beef).",
    "I fed this to my Golden Retriever and he hated it.  He wouldn't eat it, and when he did, it gave him terrible diarrhea.  We will not be buying this again.  It's also super expensive.",
    "The mouth says, \"How do I love thee, let me count the ways...\"<br />If you like apple products a must have item.  The only draw back, shipping cost.  These are very heavy.",
    "Arrived slightly thawed. My parents wouldn't accept it. However, the company was very helpful and issued a full refund.",
    "The crust on these tarts are perfect.  My husband loves these, but I'm not so crazy about them.  They are just too sour/tart for my taste.  I'll eat the crust and hubby takes my filling.  My kids think they're great, so maybe it's just me.",
    "These are absolutely scrumptuous!  My husband and I both love them, however, as another customer put it, they are expensive to ship!  The cost of shipping is more than the tartlets themselves are!",
    "What a nice alternative to an apple pie. Love the fact there was no slicing and dicing. Easy to prepare. I also loved the fact that you can make them fresh whenever needed.",
    "I like Creme Brulee. I loved that these were so easy. Just sprinkle on the sugar that came with and broil. They look amazing and taste great. My guess thought I really went out of the way for them when really it took all of 5 minutes. I will be ordering more!",
    "not what I was expecting in terms of the company's reputation for excellent home delivery products",
    "I first bought pickled asparagus at an Amish market and it was love at first bite. Hence, when I saw these on the discount rack at the local Safeway I cleaned it out.  These are even better than the ones from the Amish market. They are fantastic, and some of the jars have a bonus clove of garlic at the bottom. I'm going to order the six pack and I'm a household of one. They wont go to waste!",
    "I love asparagus.  Up until very recently, I had never had pickled asparagus.  Oh my goodness, when a friend introduced me to this exact brand, I couldn't believe how great stuff tasted.  I loved it so much I bought the six pack.  I've got 2 jars left.  Gonna need more!!",
    "I'm presently on a diet and I was at my Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Grocery looking over possible diet foods. I wanted things that were tasty, non-fat and low in calories. I came home with about a dozen items. That's how I discovered the Tillen Farms Pickled Crispy Asparagus. Well, I've always liked asparagus anyway and I've enjoyed several brands of pickled asparagus. This Tillen Farms brand is really, really good! It's the best I can recall. There's an excellent flavor and a big clove of garlic down in  the bottom of the jar which I'm looking forward to eating. I can't believe how good this asparagus tastes and right on the front it says \"only 60 calories per jar!\" Now this is my idea of a good diet food!<br /><br />Gary Peterson",
    "I was diappointed in the flavor and texture of this mix.  I usually like most of the Low Carb things I have tried, but was diappointed in this specific one.",
    "I have been drinking this tea for a long time now.  I used to have to purchase it at a doctor's office because it wasn't available elsewhere.  I'm so glad that I can buy it now from Amazon.com.  I drink this tea throughout the day like other folks drink coffee.  Wonderful taste.",
    "I have been drinking Royal King 100% Natural Organic Green Tea (100 tea bags x 2g each) as my every day tea for several years now.  I buy 12 boxes at a time to save on shipping.  For many years I used to drink coffee from morning till night.  But finally I realized that drinking so much coffee was not healthy for me.  I finally resolved to improve my health and stopped drinking coffee all together.  I tried many alternative drinks to replace my coffee habit.  I found that green tea was not only good tasting it also has health benefits.  Green tea is one of the few drinks that actually makes you healthier (coffe and other drinks do not) - the only healthier drink is quality cold water.  In my opinion, for the price, Royal King 100% Natural Organic Green Tea is one of the best tasting teas.  This green tea has a beautiful golden color, the taste is bright and fresh.  I recommend adding a tiny amount of Y.S. Organic Bee Farms RAW HONEY to the tea to add sweetness and health benefits too.  I also give myself a treat once in a while by having a much more expense tea (Tribute Xi Hu Long Jing) but this fantastic tea is not practical for me to drink as my every day tea (although I would if I could afford it).<br /><br />Cons:  On my latest shipment the package shown on the Amazon page is different than the one shipped.  The one shipped displays \"NATURALLY HIGH IN POLYPHENOL CATECHINS\" (a key contributive element to the possible health effects of tea), whereas the Amazon package displays \"CAFFENE FREE\".  So I am not sure if this green tea is Caffene free or not.  The other con is that sometimes the tea bag rips open when I unwrap the string from around the tea bag. So if the string seems stuck to the tea bag I put the bag in the hot water to unstick it.",
    "this has to be one of the best teas I have ever tasted... it's clean, bright, fresh...<br /><br />great delivery...again quality... just try it...",
    "I love, love this green tea.  It is very hard to find in our area and some places on the internet charge a big price and I usually don't get as many boxes as I did with this merchant.  I will definitely order from this seller again!! Thanks!!  I depend on my green tea fix everyday!",
    "I love this tea. It helps curb my eating during the day. My Mom and I have given it all friends to try.",
    "I'm Italian and I lived in Italy for years. I used to buy these cookies for my everyday breakfast with an Italian espresso. I couldn't find them anywhere here in the Bay area, so it's great to have them again.",
    "In the 1980s I spent several summers in Italy. This biscotti is often given as a breakfast food or mid-day snack. They are simple and delicious and were not sold in the US back then. They are so good that I brought back two bags from a recent trip to Italy. It is great to see that they may now be found on Amazon!<br /><br />Note: it is great to open a bag, smell the contents, pour a glass of milk, then dip the Macines in the milk. Great routine and treat for kids!",
    "I had heard a little about this product from the local pet store, then tried a small bag for our 2 cats of about 3 and 6 years respectively. The female, younger one took to it right away, and the older male, who was unfortunately weaned on the junk cat food with all the corn meal and etc... in it, and would usually refuse a diet change, actually liked it too. The older male is overweight and we were trying to switch him to soft food on the doctor's request, but he totally refused it. He is a posh cat after all. He still consumes too many calories, the fatty, but at least I know he's eating good food. Of course, I know this product seems to cost more than most other feline food on the market, but I just can't see feeding our animals the lousy alternatives that are out there, marketed as being healthy. Why do commercials show cats eating a vegetarian diet which is mostly corn meal? Is that right? I'll stay with this for now, but stay tuned.<br /><br />I'm updating this review after 9 months of using this cat food for our two cats. I upgraded the stars from 4 to 5 as it really has been a good food for the two of them. Garfield still eats a little too much, but he's just a big cat who doesn't exercise much, let's face it. Our female cat will be 4 years old in a couple months and she's so healthy. She's tiny, but happy and agile. I tried the chicken version of Holistic Select, but Garfield seemd to miss this sardine version so we went back to this one. I've ordered the duck version and will update this once they try it.",
    "I started buying this after I noticed my 1 year old cat was already starting to lose his \"spunk\" so I decided it was time to start buying him \"real\" cat food...not the garbage in the super markets. I found this at the pet store out of the other million choices, and I'm sure there are other brands that are just as good but this is the one I went with to try first and it was a great purchase. My cat has been on this for the past 8 months and he's now just has active as he was when he was a kitten and his coat has became sooo soft. Mainly, he loved the taste even more! I highly recommend this brand to all my friends and family for their animals!",
    "I have done a lot of research to find the best food for my cat, and this is an excellent food.  That is also according to my holistic veterinarian.  They put probiotics on the kibble as the last step, which is very important to me.  The best thing is that my cat loved it immediately and I had to stop mixing it with the old food because she only would eat Holistic Select.",
    "This cat food was recommended by my vet because my 13 year old Cleo Cat was having trouble keeping any food down and was loosing weight.  It stopped her problems.  She doesn't eat as much as before since she seems to be more satisfied after eating which helps justify the added price.  It aids in digestion since the...ok sorry...smells are gone if ya know what I mean.  Had to add that so anyone experiencing problems with their cats can see there are a lot of benifits from this cat food.",
    "I have a 4 year old male cat who has chronic urinary tract infections.  I feed him this dry food in combination with wet food (with water added to it) and Uri Ease.  The combination seems to keeps his UTI's under control.  If I switch to another type of dry food, his UTI gets worse.  The other cats seem to enjoy this food as well.  It's expensive but it seems to be the best solution for me.",
    "Before I was educated about feline nutrition, I allowed my cats to become addicted to dry cat food. I always offered both canned and dry, but wish I would have fed them premium quality canned food and limited dry food. I have two 15 year old cats and two 5 year old cats. The only good quality dry foods they will eat are Wellness and Innova. Innova's manufacturer was recently purchased by Procter&Gamble. I began looking for a replacement. After once again offering several samples (from my local holistic pet store) Holistic Select was the only one (other than the usual Wellness and Innova) they would eat. For finicky cats, I recommend trying Holistic Select. It is a good quality food that is very palatable for finicky eaters.",
    "My holistic vet recommended this, along with a few other brands. We tried them all, but my cats prefer this (especially the sardine version). The best part is their coats are so soft and clean and their eyes are so clear. AND (and I don't want to be rude, so I'll say this as delicately as I can) their waste is far less odorous than cats who eat the McDonalds junk found in most stores, which is a definite plus for me! The health benefits are so obvious - I highly recommend Holistic Select!",
    "One of my cats is allergic to fish and beef. This formula is one of the few she can eat, and it has much better ingredients than the prescription diets available at the vet. Both of my kitties are very active, have soft shiny fur, and neither are fat. Dry food reduces tartar buildup on teeth, also.",
    "Our cats thrive extremely well on this dry cat food.  They definitely have much less hair ball throw ups and their fur is great.  They are fit and not over weight.  This vendor ships extremely fast.  Is one of the top Amazon suppliers in our book!",
    "I've been a fan of Hot & Spicy Maruchan Ramen for a long time. If you enjoy spice, and love ramen, you'll love this product. Too bad it's way too expensive here on Amazon. It's only $3.36 per 12 at my Walmart.",
    "I've been eating Ramen noodles since I was a little kid, and I've never found a better flavor than Hot & Spicy Chicken!  It isn't hot at all to a chilihead like me, but it sure is good!",
    "I LOVE spicy ramen, but for whatever reasons this thing burns my stomach badly and the burning sensation doesn't go away for like 3 hours! Not sure if that is healthy or not .... and you can buy this at Walmart for $0.28, way cheaper than Amazon.",
    "Always being a fan of ramen as a quick and easy meal, finding it on amazon for a decent price and having it delivered to your door by the case is an amazing situation for anyone to find themselves in.",
    "I must be a bit of a wuss, because this soup tastes to me how I imagine fire might taste. Typically I like spicy food if it has a good flavor.  I don't find this to be the case with this soup. Any flavor is killed off by the burn.",
    "I really loved the spicy flavor these had.  I found myself liking the broth more than the noodles which is usually the opposite.  If you aren't used to the heat this might bother you and if you like hot hot foods this might not be enough.",
    "Got these on sale for roughly 25 cents per cup, which is half the price of my local grocery stores, plus they rarely stock the spicy flavors. These things are a GREAT snack for my office where time is constantly crunched and sometimes you can't escape for a real meal. This is one of my favorite flavors of Instant Lunch and will be back to buy every time it goes on sale.",
    "i have bought allot of different flavors and this happens to be one of my favorites and will be getting more soon",
    "I love this flavor of ramen! I don't eat other flavors anymore because they taste too bland by comparison. For the convenience of having it delivered to my home (I have prime, so I get it in two days and don't have to pay for the shipping), the price on amazon isn't bad at all, but it is still cheaper to run down and pick up a case of this at the grocery store.",
    "The BEST investment I've ever made for ginger. It's unbelievable! It's fibrous like the real ginger, has that spicy kick to it, but it's perfect with the sugar - calms it down.  It's very worth the $40 for 5lbs of it!  I'll be getting more soon - I use these as a topper for my ginger cupcakes and cookies :)",
    "Delicious. I cannot get Australian ginger where I live. This compares favorably to Australian Ginger I've purchased in other cities. Now I can enjoy it without traveling.",
    "I keep trying other brands.... cheaper brands. Stupid me! This ginger IS soooo worth the money. Tender, moist and never a let down.",
    "My son has had acid reflux since birth and has been on every medication available with no improvement, Until an older gentleman came into his work place and told him about this product and I automatically ordered it for him. I was really not expecting any better results than the 1000 other things we have tried. What a surprise! He has not had any heartburn or symptoms since day 2 of starting eating one piece of this Ginger each morning. He can now eat anything and actually enjoy it. This product was a God send for him. Thank you all for it!",
    "I bought this for our office to give people something sweet to snack on.  Because it's bite size it's easier for people to grab a couple a pieces rather than an entire licorice stick. My only complaint is that one of the bags broke open in shipping.",
    "Twizzlers brand licorice is much better than that other well known brand.<br />If you can get these for $2 to $2.50 a package with free s/h it's a good deal.<br />The black and cherry have good taste; but the strawberry taste was too delicate and barely there",
    "I love these.........very tasty!!!!!!!!!!!  Infact, I think I am addicted to them.<br />Buying them in packs of 6 bags - is very reasonable than going to Target and getting a bag.  Savings are about a $1.00 a bag.  I use subscribe and save on these and several other product.  I love subscribe and save!!!!!!!!!!!",
    "If you are looking for a less messy version of licorice for the children, then be sure to try these!  They're soft, easy to chew, and they don't get your hands all sticky and gross in the car, in the summer, at the beach, etc. We love all the flavos and sometimes mix these in with the chocolate to have a very nice snack! Great item, great price too, highly recommend!",
    "I might be mistaken, but it appears that the pieces in this bag were reduced in size.  If they did do that, it was doubtlessly done to make it appear that the buyer got a better deal, having so many pieces after all.  The problem is that the pieces have to be a certain size in order to have enough flavor for your eating experience.  As it is, you have to use 2 or 3 pieces to match the old piece size;  it is not the same.",
    "Being a fan of Newman's Pineapple salsa for quite a while, I was looking for a comparable salsa.  This is one of the best tasting salsas I've ever had.  My daughters love it too.  They don't like super chunky salsa and the Berry Mango has a nice smooth texture with small mango pieces.  The salsa is not too sweet, just sweet enough and although it's mild, it has a nice little kick to it.  At this price, it's a steal!",
    "The SALSA smelled delicious, as I think it probably was - but, unfortunately, the person, at AMAZON, that is a packer (there is probably several) had very little \"stuffing\" to work with, especially on the bottoms.  Therefore, the bottoms were broken on all three bottles. As I reached for my computer; I was told NO RETURNS (cause it's a food item).  I then looked for a CUSTOMER SERVICE tag; and I found \"none\" on their NEW FACE LIFT.  THEY SEEM TO BE PROUD OF THEIR NEW FACE LIFT BUT...THEY SHOULD AT LEAST HAVE A PLACE TO CONTACT THEM IN EMERGENCIES!  LIKE: I BUY A LOT OF \"STUFF\" AND IT ALL COMES IN STYROFOAM BOXES.  NEVER WOULD I SHIP THINGS<br />ESPECIALLY SALSA - IN A CARDBOARD BOX WITH JUST A STRIPE OF LARGE BUBBLE WRAP ON IT.  NO MATTER HOW MUCH THE CARRIER (FED EX) IS CAREFUL, IT'S GOING TO BREAK SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE.  ESPECIALLY IN AN ALL GLASS CONTAINER!  BARBARA L. S.",
    "This is one of the best salsas that I have found in a long time but stay away from the variety pack. The other two that come with it are not worth your money.",
    "These remind me of dog treats I made once using pumpkin and cinnamon. They're kind of bland and not my favorite Back To Nature product. But my finace really loves them so that's where the three stars come from.",
    "This is the best cornmeal. I made regular cornbread and hot water cornbread with this meal and both were outstanding. Also fried some oysters with this meal, it gave them a great texture and flovor.",
    "This is a fabulous marinade!  I love to use it for chicken, either baked in the oven OR on the grill.  This has enough flavor & flair, I've even used it for dinner parties, only to receive rave reviews from my guests!! DEFINITELY worth the price! Super cheap and super easy! Love it!",
    "Works with chicken fish beef or pork. Fast easy and makes it taste excellent. Plus buying in bulk is more than 50% off from box stores",
    "Got this for my brother who is on Jorge Cruise diet and decided to try one for myself.  It actually tastes pretty good.",
    "These singles sell for $2.50 - $3.36 at the store for 1 box of 24 singles. I'm not sure why Amazon is selling it for $9.99 for a box of 24 singles.  Hazelnut coffee creamer is my favorite, but truly this is not a good buy.",
    "AWESOME!!! such a yummy flavor I got it as a healthy alternative to the desserts we normally eat and I am so glad that I did there are so many things you can do with Jello desserts and still have them taste good and be good for you. I will definitentally be purchasing this product again the flavor was so wonderful.",
    "I went to 4 grocery stores looking for this flavor of Jello for my green tomato jam recipe and finally found it here. This jello is wonderful! Evidently it's only carried in the stores during the summer but with harvest time in the Fall, I couldn't find it anywhere in town. This Jello tastes like watermelon and the jam recipe I made with it takes like watermelon jam! Great made as regular Jello too. Yummy!",
    "What a deal this is the healthiest salt you can use.  This box should last our family the year no problem.  Iodized sea salt will not raise your blood pressure as regular salt will.",
    "Perfect size sea salt for the table or the picnic basket.  We love it. Shakes well, no clumping and flows freely.",
    "<span class=\"tiny\"> Length:: 0:26 Mins<br /><br /></span>The expiration date is 21 months from the day I bought this product. The tuna, tomato combination is delicious. This is one of the many items I re-order on Amazon every month or so.<br />edit: added a short video, so you see what this combination looks like.<br /><br />I was wearing one of those headlamps, but I didn't do a good job focusing on the tuna.<br />I should film it over, but it doesn't look like many people view this product anyway.",
    "I've never heard of the SAFCOL brand before but I was tired of only trying the typical pouches; Starkist and Chicken of the Sea. I was really surprised as I thought it was a bit better than the other brands and with less seasoning.",
    "these are the best tasting tuna pack they make in my opinion - make a great on the go snack, and really satisfying with the tomato",
    "I have always purchased Star-Kist tuna but thought I would try this brand for a change of pace. The taste of the tuna was not pleasant, too much basil and other spices for me.",
    "I'm not familiar with the Safcol brand but being a tuna addict, gave this a shot. The tuna tastes like it's good quality but I found the tomato basil flavor to be a bit bland. It's better than something plain but it didn't pack the punch I was hoping for. It's still a great option for a low calorie, low fat meal.",
    "I found it much tastier than the plain tuna pouches out there. Excellent quality, and no need to 'dress it up'.<br /><br />I put it the micro on about 20% power for 1 minute and Shazam!<br /><br />I believe a little heating brings out the flavor.",
    "Seriously this product was as tasteless as they come. There are much better tasting products out there but at 100 calories its better than a special k bar or cookie snack pack. You just have to season it or combine it with something else to share the flavor.",
    "I read about pomegranate molasses so I had to try it! I haven't made anything with it yet, just eaten a little bit at a time but WOW is it decadent! It's dark, syrupy, sour, and a little sweet. A dab of this and I forget about dessert. It's just a really unique flavor with a pleasing metallic undertone. Yum!! I'm going to try making fesenjan next :-)",
    "Used this in Moroccan recipes, as a syrup in a brilliant mixed beverage and as a swirled topping on sliced oranges soaked in orange water.  Wonderful, wonderful stuff!",
    "I don't know how long these sat on the back of a shelf somewhere, but they were so old that they wouldn't cook.  I had to throw half of them out, because the skins were damaged, a clear sign of dried beans past their prime.  I can't even return these or ask for a refund, because food is not returnable.  Will find a different brand to use.  For now, I have about fifty servings of beans to throw away.",
    "Besides being smaller than runts, they look the same and have the same consistency.  Unfortunately, they taste nothing like banana runts...nor do they even taste good.  Yucky stuff.  Trying to return with vendor.",
    "The item over all was fine, but the Banana Heads are not just like Banana Runts they are alot smaller. Also when I received the item, the packaging was not great. The Banana Heads had come open during shipping and were all over the packing envelope.",
    "I purchased as a giveaway for a baby shower with Jungle theme! They worked out perfect for 25 small bags of candy. I purchased 5#. If you want more than 25 small bags, I would purchase a larger bag.",
    "I have drunk Ricore since my mother allowed be to drink caffeine. I love this stuff in milk.<br />It's much smoother and tastier than instant coffee with milk. I am French and live in the US,<br />and bring back boxes of Ricore at every opportunity. Savora is another hidden gem you can bring<br />back. Check it out.",
    "I first had this drink when my mother brought it back with her from a visit to her home in Brittany France and thought it was delicious!  I wish it were a bit cheaper but other than that, I love this product!",
    "I couldn't wait to try the 8&#8243; Cinnamon Coffee Cake because it is made with fresh eggs, creamy sour cream, Madagascar Bourbon Vanilla and is topped and filled with cinnamon streusel. This 8&#8243; Cinnamon Coffee Cake is available online for only $18.95. Now, I have had my fair share of cinnamon coffee cakes, but, let me just tell you that the FantasiCakes Cinnamon Coffee Cake really \"takes the cake\" with size, price, quality and taste.<br />The cake arrived very fast and was carefully packaged so that it arrived in almost perfect condition. It also comes with a large tub of white icing that you can drizzle over the top, before serving. I couldn't believe how large the size was and it actually fed my family of 5 for us to enjoy during breakfast, for three days. The cake itself is thick and almost has a solid but sponge cake type consistency that is really moist and very filling. The flavors are to die for with the sticky cinnamon outside and sweet cinnamon and vanilla swirled throughout the inside of the cake. The icing really tops it off beautifully and gives it that moist and sticky sweet flavor. Pair the cake with your morning coffee and you've got the perfect breakfast treat!",
    "I used to love these growing up and stopped drinking water and lemon juice from this brand about 5-6 years ago. This stuff used to be so strong i used to just pour some in my mouth and get that alive feeling going. It feels like the product went through changes which added more water or something to make it not so strong. The stronger it is the less you use as well. The product is still really good but the taste is the same quality as the cheaper brand names almost. I thought  these would go fast but hey all lemon stuff i love unless it goes bad. This is a good product just wish it still had that hit me in the mouth chug sensation it used to be like.",
    "One of the best lemon juice that I have tried. I am recurring customer due to the high quality of this product. When the season for fresh lemos is out, this one supplement our need for the citrus on the kitchen or refreshments.<br /><br />I will continue buying it.",
    "This lemon juice is a must in my kitchen year-round. It has a powerful flavor and you don't need much of it to zest up a dish. I add a spritz of it to my water nearly every day.<br /><br />I will buy this product again and again.",
    "Fast delivery and good product. This is the same lemon juice concentrate you can find in stores and it's really handy to have around to add to sauces, dressings, etc. Such a pain to squeeze fresh juice everytime you need it, nevermind having the lemons on hand to begin with.",
    "This is not as good as the Frozen Lemon juice, but it is good. It has a slightly odd flavor, perhaps from a preservative. Sure wish I could order the frozen juice!",

After a short time my eyes start to get droopy and I am in another place.<br /><br />Love this stuff.",

    "WE have been looking for \"natural\" ways to help us sleep since we always seem to be overloaded with stress and a busy schedule. Yes, we'd probably be better served taking a yoga class, but this is a good second choice. This helps you fall asleep and stay asleep. I drank half the first night and that was plenty for me. After about 30 minutes, I was ready for bed! I woke up refreshed and with no sleepy-drug hangover, so that is a huge bonus.<br /><br />I gave the product 3 stars (instead of the 5 it deserves) as their packing job was marginal at best. The product arrived with 2 broken bottles, which at this price is a $6 loss! The bottles are glass and all they did was wrap one layer of the small-bubbled bubble wrap around the case and placed it in a larger box with extra room to move around in that box. Big packing fail, but the product is awesome.",
    "We made chocolate chip cookies with BRM Garbanzo Bean Flour and the results were fantastic!  The brown sugar and chocolate mask any bean taste that other reviews have mentioned.  Our friends couldn't discern any difference from classic CCCs.  The texture, body, and elasticity (meaning reduced tendency to fall apart that occurs with most other gluten-free flours) is nice and chewy -- the same as CCCs made with regular flour.  And an added bonus -- the high protein and fiber level (I calculate 2-3 g fiber/cookie) fills you up so that you are satisfied with smaller servings and the glycemic index is significantly lower.<br /><br />I highly recommend this flour even if CCCs are the only thing you make with it.",
    "This  is great stuff.  Made some really tasty banana bread.  Good quality and lowest price in town.",

    "This packet of glaze is the secret to making those European style fresh fruit tarts. I am about to make one for a pie auction at church, after a friend requested that something \"strawberry\" should be offered. You can make the most amazing and relatively \"healthy\" fruit tarts by baking a base, layering it with uncooked, fresh, sliced fruit, then pouring over the made-up contents of one of these packets. They harden up at room temperature, hold the fruit together so you can slice the tart, and they let the beauty of the arranged fruit show through. I've also seen this glaze used over cheesecakes, to hold a fruit topping in place. Personally, I do not like cheesecake (too rich for me) but a fruit glazed cheesecake is gorgeous, I will admit. To do this, slice fruit and layer it on the cheesecake while it's still in the springform pan. Pour on the glaze, let it set up and then remove the springform. You'll have a clear layer of fruit on top of the cheesecake. Cherries, strawberries or sliced mangos are nice, but the best one I ever had used thin slices of lemons, that had been gently poached in sugar syrup before they were layered on the cake.<br /><br />I use a base of sponge cake, baked in a shallow form, but other bases can be pate sucre  (a kind of French pastry that is a bit like a sugar cookie) that works well in those fluted, straight-sided forms. You can also make mini-tarts in a muffin pan, pre-baking each mold with a layer of pie crust (even commercial crust works, though again, I prefer pate sucre, it holds its shape better and is more substantial and has a better crumb.) Just blind-bake the muffin tins lined with pate, then pop them out and fill with fresh fruits (berries are great) and pour over the glaze. Some people put a layer of creme patisserie, which is a pastry cream like custard but stabilized with flour,  below the fruit and I happen to think these taste best.<br /><br />If you get into baking, this glaze is a must-have on the shelf. The ingredients are vegan: tapioca starch, carrageenan, dextrose, cream of tartar, locust bean gum, so if you are looking to make a vegan tofu cheesecake, you can use this on top, as well as use it for fruit tarts with a nut crust base.",

    "I bought this coffee because its much cheaper than the ganocafe and has the organic reishi mushroom as well as other healthy antioxidants.  I didn't expect it to taste good, but it actually does!  I've only had it for a few days and for $5 its totally worth it.  My sisters all take ganocafe but now I'm introducing them to this less expensive similar coffee.  I will follow up on this product in a few weeks.  :)",
    "The coffee is very finely processed and the flavor is just alright.  Nescafe and Mount Hagen are better - I bought this to try something other than these two, but I probably won't get this again.  There is just a slight \"vitaminy\" taste, but it's not overwhelming.  It's also a bit pricey for what you get.",
    "This coffee is great because it's all organic ingredients!  No pesticides to worry about, plus it tastes good, and you have the healing effects for ganoderma.",

    "Tastes great, and gives me energy without the jitters. Love this product.<br />However, I do wish it came in some sort of resealable jar or hard plastic container instead of a zip-lock pouch because the zip-lock ripped off and quit working after awhile. But the product is fantastic, just not crazy about the packaging.",
    "These little guys are tasty and refreshing.<br /><br />I usually eat salads for lunch which can do terrible things to breath.  I eat 2 of these after lunch (because they are so small) and I find this sufficiently resolves the problem.<br /><br />They're sugar free (sugar can actually help the smelly bacteria grow) which is great and they're tasty enough that I almost think of them as part of my lunch.<br /><br />This is a good bulk value buy and I'd highly recommend the mints themselves.

    "Pros:<br />+packaging, shipping, price<br />+sold about a year before its expiration date (enough for me to eat/share 9 boxes)<br />+not too \"fresh\" like the regular wintergreen and not in a powdery form. it's a real mint!<br /><br />Cons: none!",
    "Be careful not to eat too many of them in one day, as one of the chemicals in it is the same as that of a LAXATIVE!!! LOLOLOL!!!",
    "These mints are really strong and have a great taste. They are also a convenient size to carry in a pocket or purse.",
    "This is a huge supply of them. I'm still working on these and have plenty to spare. Much more effective than buying one from the grocery store or 7-11 every time you want a mint.",
    "Even with small containers, they don't fill them up.  These little tins are less than half filled and at the price charged it seems a rip-off. Is there some exotic ingredient as costly as gold contained in those tiny squares?  Or how about the cereal ploy, they were filled at the factory but settled in transport.<br />Can manufacturers be honest in their dealings?"

    "If you love oatmeal but are constantly pressed for time, McCann's Instant Oatmeal is an excellent choice. Though it's hard to deny that instant oatmeal doesn't quite match up to the flavor of even a generic stovetop version, McCann's is undoubtedly the cream of the crop in the instant category. In fact, it's superior to many organic and all-natural brands I've sampled. The assorted flavors in McCann's variety pack are all quite tasty, and you can quickly prepare it with either a microwave or boiling water, making it incredibly convenient when you're in a hurry.\n\nMoreover, McCann's use of real cane sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup was a major selling point for me. Real sugar not only tastes better but is also less harmful. However, I'm not a fan of their use of thickeners like guar gum. Ideally, oatmeal should be just oats, water, and heat to create a creamy, delicious texture. I suspect these additives are the reason McCann's instant oatmeal sometimes becomes overly thick and gluey after sitting for a bit. Despite this, it remains a practical choice for those with limited time.",
    "This is a high-quality instant oatmeal from a leading brand. It’s sweetened with cane sugar rather than high fructose corn syrup, offering a superior taste and potentially healthier option according to some doctors. Perfect for a cold morning when you’re short on time and can’t prepare McCann’s Steel Cut Oats. The apple cinnamon flavor is the best, but the maple and brown sugar and the original flavors are also delicious. Plus, you can easily distinguish between the three flavors without needing to tweak them.",
    "Instant oatmeal often turns soggy as soon as the water is added, but McCann's Instant Oatmeal maintains its texture, offers excellent flavor, and is nutritious. While McCann's regular oatmeal is also outstanding, it requires more preparation time than many can afford in the morning.

They're convenient, healthy, quick to prepare, high-quality, and incredibly affordable...",
    "McCann's offers oatmeal to suit every preference, from the traditional oats that require half an hour to cook, to the quick instant version that can be ready in under three minutes in the microwave. Both types are of high quality. The instant oatmeal comes in various flavors and the regular option, providing a range of tastes to explore and comparing it to other brands. \n\nI appreciate that McCann's oatmeal is thicker and more substantial than popular American brands. However, the Apples & Cinnamon flavor can be a bit watery, so you might need to adjust the water amount. In my 1300-watt microwave, it cooks in about one minute and twenty-seven seconds, but your cooking time and water may vary.\n\nThe only downside is that you must buy in bulk, getting six ten-count boxes at once.

    "I picked up the Mango flavor, and it doesn't taste like Mango to me at all. There's no hint of sweetness, and, sadly, it has an aftertaste reminiscent of licorice. Having consumed a wide range of sports nutrition products for decades, I'm quite acquainted with and generally enjoy their flavors. However, the Mango flavor ranks among the least appealing I've tried. It's not awful, but it's bad enough that I notice the unpleasant taste with every sip.",

These gummy bears are slightly larger than those from other brands and possess a mildly sour tang, but nothing overly intense. As an aficionado of grape-flavored confections and sodas, I find these to be quite delightful. While there is another manufacturer that produces superior grape gummy bears, in my opinion, these are an excellent option considering their price.\n\nI particularly enjoy incorporating these gummy bears into homemade popsicles using flavored sports drinks. The electrolytes in the sports drink result in softer popsicles, and the frozen gummy bears add an extra layer of deliciousness. Overall, they are scrumptious!",
    "I ordered two of these pastries and two raspberry lattice tarts directly from the FantasiCakes website for a dinner party I was hosting. They arrived fresh and in perfect condition, and the size was very generous. I decided to freeze half for future use. As a pastry lover, I can confidently say these were the best I've ever tasted. The pastry was soft, the jam was exceptionally flavorful, and the overall taste was fantastic. These treats were devoured quickly, and my guests were thoroughly impressed.",
    "**Beware, Sweet Tooth Enthusiasts!**\n\nThis particular sweetener might not be your new best friend. Maltitol, a sugar alcohol, can be nearly impossible for some to digest. Within a short time after consumption, unsuspecting individuals may experience extreme intestinal bloating, intense cramping, and an almost comical amount of gas. It doesn't end there—nausea, diarrhea, and headaches can join the unpleasant mix.\n\nI learned this the hard way years ago. I was mesmerized by Suzanne Somers' sugar-free chocolates, convinced I had found sugar-free nirvana at the first taste. But oh, how swiftly that bliss turned sour! The terrible side effects of maltitol swooped in, and I felt discomfort beyond anything I had ever known—balloon-like bloating and searing abdominal cramps. Even as the symptoms faded, they left an unforgettable mark. Skeptical that a low-calorie sweetener could be to blame, I cut out the chocolates and, voila, all symptoms vanished.\n\nMy suspicions were reluctantly confirmed a year later. Imagine my delight upon finding some delectable sugar-free popcorn at my local market. The taste was divine, but my heart sank when a tiny asterisk on the label led me to discover the dreaded ingredient in microscopic lettering: \"maltitol.\" Luckily, I had only eaten a little, but the old side effects reappeared—mercifully, for a shorter time.\n\nWhile some people can enjoy maltitol with zero issues, others, like me, might face quite the ordeal. So, if you're experiencing similar distress—take heart! It's not you; it's the maltitol.",
    "It's alright, but I wouldn't make a special trip to buy it again.",
    "There was no tea flavor at all, only a bunch of artificial flavors. It is not returnable, and I wasted over $20.",
    "I initially thought these would be a great addition to my trail mix, but when they arrived, they were a solid mass of melted chocolate. I left them in my pantry for a few days, hoping they would return to their original state, but they remained gooey even at room temperature. I decided to put them in the fridge, and I've been breaking off pieces ever since. The taste is still enjoyable, though the texture has become grainy due to the melting and re-solidifying process. While I won't be ordering them online again, if I come across them in a store, I would consider purchasing them.",
    "These taste great and are similar to another brand I've tried. However, like all chocolate, they can melt in warm weather since there's no insulated packaging with ice packs. It's best to order them in cold weather and stock up!",
    "The taste was amazing, but the berries had melted. Definitely planning to order again in winter. If you order during cold weather, you'll absolutely love the flavor!",
    "I acknowledge that I can't make tea this delicious. While I'm not from the South, I've never tasted tea this sweet without being overly sweet. It has a crisp flavor.",
    "This peppermint stick is delightful and enjoyable to eat. My dad gave me one for Christmas, recalling that I had a similar treat when I was a little girl. Now, at 30, I still love it!",
    "Great gift for all ages! I bought these giant canes before, and the recipients loved them so much they wouldn't eat them.",
    "Sure! Here's the revised version to make it more engaging:\n\nDon't let the term \"Molecular Gastronomy\" intimidate you—it’s actually a game-changer for your daily coffee ritual! I've been searching for something like this for ages, not for fancy food science tricks, but for something practical and down-to-earth: my own coffee creamer.\n\nI adore my coffee blonde and sweet, but store-bought flavored creamers are loaded with unhealthy fats and artificial ingredients that I’d rather avoid. Plus, cold milk or cream just doesn't cut it for my steaming hot cup of Joe.\n\nOne day, while browsing Amazon, I had an epiphany: why not create my own creamer? I also found low-fat (non-instant) milk powder and regular milk powder. The non-instant low-fat milk is sweeter and tastes fresher but doesn’t dissolve well in cold water—not an issue for hot coffee. You’ll need to experiment with the ratios; I found that using just the heavy cream powder made my coffee too rich, and it's also pricey. My sweet spot is a blend of one-third each.\n\nFor flavor, I bought cocoa bean powder, vanilla bean powder, and superfine sugar. I mix up small batches with spices like cinnamon and nutmeg to craft my personalized flavored creamers. If you prefer, a sugar substitute would work just as well. I store my concoctions in jelly canning jars and use a mini food processor to blend everything evenly, so the sugar doesn’t settle at the bottom. Pro tip: let it settle before opening the top.\n\nThis DIY creamer tastes leaps and bounds better than anything from the store, and the fun part is experimenting to create your own unique flavors. Next on my list? Mixing in essential oils for a divine chocolate-orange flavor.\n\nAll the ingredients can be found online. Take the time to experiment—you might skip the low-fat milk or decide against adding flavors. The possibilities are endless, and these custom creamers make fantastic housewarming or hostess gifts!\n\nWhile molecular gastronomy experts can certainly do more sophisticated things, my primary goal was to make my own creamer, and it turned out spectacularly. Dive in and start creating!",
    "My dogs enjoy all the flavors of this dog food, but they started itching more with the lamb and rice flavor. I use limited ingredient dog food to help with their itching. The duck and sweet potato flavor reduced their itching a lot, but the lamb and rice made it worse again. I like Natural Balance for its quality ingredients.",
    "Great dog food, but my Boston Terrier, who has bad reactions to some ingredients, started itching a lot and jumping out of bed at night to scratch. When I switched to a different formula, the itching stopped. I'm glad Natural Balance has other options. You need to try different ones to see what works best for your pet.",
    "We own three dogs, and they all enjoy this food! We originally purchased it for one of our dogs with food allergies, and it has been fantastic for him – no more hot spots or stomach issues. I really appreciate that it ships directly to our door with no shipping fees.",
    "My poor dog has battled all sorts of allergies, both environmental and food-related. Initially, she was on a prescription diet, but after running some tests, we discovered she was actually allergic to an ingredient in that very food. After an exhaustive search, I finally stumbled upon a new dog food that has been a game changer! While her environmental allergies still flare up, I'm thrilled to have found something she can eat without suffering. It's such a relief to see her happy and pain-free at mealtime.",
    "My shepherd/collie mix, who has IBS, has shown significant improvement since our vet recommended a limited ingredient diet. She enjoys the food, and I always purchase it from Amazon due to the $10 savings and free shipping!",
    "Natural Balance Dry Dog Food Lamb Meal and Brown Rice Recipe worked miracles for my Jack Russell! She struggles with terrible food allergies, and this was our last hope as it was the only food we found without any ingredients she’s allergic to. She happily eats it dry, but I usually mix the Natural Balance Dry Lamb and Brown Rice with the Wet Lamb and Brown Rice version – she seems to prefer that combination. We've started feeding it to our other dog (a Bichon), and she absolutely loves it too! If your dog has allergies, stomach issues, or if you simply want to improve your dog's diet, this is the food for you. You will notice a remarkable difference in your pet!",
    "Fantastic food! I adore the concept of a single food for all ages and breeds. It's extremely convenient and an excellent product. My three dogs eat less, have minimal gas, and their stools are regular and perfectly consistent. What more could a dog mom ask for?",
    "My standard poodle and pomeranian thrive on this food! Despite trying other brands for cost reasons, we always come back to Natural Balance for its exceptional quality.",
    "This dog food is excellent. My dog has severe allergies, and this is the only brand we can give him.",
    "This food is awesome for dogs of all ages! I have a 3-year-old and a puppy, and both of their coats are super soft, and they hardly ever get sick. Plus, it’s awesome that you can get it with Amazon Prime shipping! :)",
    "My golden retriever is one of the most selective dogs I've ever encountered. After trying out various food options, I discovered she adores Natural Balance. One aspect I really appreciate about Natural Balance is that it offers multiple flavors in both dry and wet forms. I mix her dry food with a bit of wet food, and my golden retriever loves it. Moreover, I enjoy switching up the flavors each time because I believe the same meal every day might become monotonous, so I thought, why not? I usually avoid the fish flavors since they smell...\n\nAdditionally, I began buying from Amazon because Petco didn’t carry the wet food in boxes and only had a few cans. When I got home, I was pleasantly surprised to find out that I could save $20 each time I bought dog food if I ordered from Amazon.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend Natural Balance dog food. Although I've never tasted it myself, my dog seems to love it.",
    "This is the same pet food we usually buy at the store. But now it gets delivered right to our doorstep! And it's either the same price or even cheaper.",
    "I've been very pleased with Natural Balance dog food. Our dogs had issues with other brands, possibly due to grain allergies. Since switching to Natural Balance grain-free, there have been no problems. Additionally, they offer different kibble sizes for larger and smaller dogs, which is very helpful.",
    "My 18-month-old Basenji/Jack Russell mix absolutely loves this dog food. Since switching from standard brands earlier this year, he has become visibly healthier and more energetic. Although natural dog foods are more expensive, I've noticed that he eats significantly less of the Natural Balance brand while still remaining satisfied and happy. Previously, he would consume up to 3 cups of regular dog food daily (the recommended amount for his size), but now he only needs about 1 to 1.5 cups of Natural Balance each day. This means you get more value for your money with natural dog foods, as they last just as long and contribute to a healthier, happier dog. Plus, with free 2-day shipping via Amazon Prime, I'm completely convinced!",
    "Our pup has suffered from allergies, including hotspots and itching, caused by other dog foods. The inexpensive, widely available options often contain harmful preservatives that can lead to health issues for your pets. This particular food has significantly reduced our dog's allergies, and he loves it. \n\nThis message is RAMSEY FrAnkenSteiN approved.",
    "My 3-year-old English Bulldog had skin allergies. The vet advised us to switch from his previous Iams Lamb and Rice to a limited diet food. This second option worked well, catering to dogs sensitive to additives and common proteins like chicken or beef.",
    "I tried giving this to my Golden Retriever, but he really didn't like it. He refused to eat it, and when he finally did, it upset his stomach and caused severe diarrhea. We definitely won't be purchasing this product again, especially given its high price.",
    "The mouth utters, \"How do I love thee? Let me count the ways...\"<br />For enthusiasts of Apple products, this item is indispensable. The only drawback is the shipping cost, as these items are quite heavy.",
    "The package arrived slightly thawed, and my parents wouldn't accept it. However, the company was very helpful and issued a full refund.",
    "The crust on these tarts is flawless. My husband loves them, but I'm not a big fan. They are just too sour for my liking. I eat the crust and my husband takes the filling. My kids think they’re fantastic, so maybe it's just a personal preference.",
    "These tartlets are scrumptious! My husband and I love them, but the shipping is pricier than the treats themselves.",
    "What a great alternative to apple pie! I love that there's no need for slicing and dicing. It's so easy to prepare, and the best part is, you can make them fresh whenever you need them.",
    "I have a distinct appreciation for Crème Brûlée. I was particularly delighted by the simplicity of preparing these desserts. One merely needs to sprinkle the provided sugar and broil. The result is visually stunning and delectable in taste. My guests assumed I had exerted considerable effort, yet the entire process took merely five minutes. I shall certainly be procuring more.",
    "This wasn't what I expected based on the company's great reputation for home delivery products.",
    "My first encounter with pickled asparagus was at an Amish market, and it was an instant hit. So, when I spotted them on the discount shelf at my local Safeway, I didn't hesitate to clear the rack. To my delight, these are even better than the Amish market ones! They're simply fantastic, and some jars even come with a bonus clove of garlic at the bottom. I'm definitely ordering the six-pack, even though I'm the only one in my household. Trust me, none of these will go to waste!",
    "I love asparagus, but until recently, I had never tried pickled asparagus. When a friend introduced me to this specific brand, I was amazed by how delicious it was. I loved it so much that I bought a six-pack. Now, I only have two jars left and definitely need to get more!",
    "I'm on a diet and went to Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Grocery for tasty, non-fat, low-calorie foods. I bought about a dozen items, including Tillen Farms Pickled Crispy Asparagus. I love asparagus and have tried several brands, but this one is the best. The flavor is excellent, and there's a big clove of garlic at the bottom of the jar that I'm excited to eat. This asparagus tastes amazing, and it's only 60 calories per jar. This is my idea of good diet food!\n\nGary Peterson",
    "I was disappointed in the flavor and texture of this mix, even though I usually like most Low Carb products.",
    "I have been consuming this tea for an extended period. Previously, I was required to procure it from a doctor's office, as it was not available through other channels. I am pleased to now have the convenience of purchasing it from Amazon.com. I consume this tea consistently throughout the day, much like others consume coffee. It boasts a wonderful taste.",
    "I have been indulging in Royal King 100% Natural Organic Green Tea (100 tea bags x 2g each) as my daily beverage for several years. To mitigate shipping costs, I procure 12 boxes at a time. For numerous years, my routine was dominated by a relentless consumption of coffee from dawn until dusk. Eventually, I recognized that such a habit was detrimental to my health. Determined to enhance my well-being, I ceased drinking coffee altogether. In my quest for a suitable substitute, I experimented with various beverages and discovered that green tea not only delights the palate but also confers numerous health benefits. Unlike coffee and other beverages, green tea genuinely contributes to improved health, rivaled only by quality cold water. In my assessment, given its price point, Royal King 100% Natural Organic Green Tea is among the most palatable options available. This tea boasts a stunning golden hue and a taste that is both vibrant and fresh. I highly recommend enhancing its sweetness and nutritional value by adding a small amount of Y.S. Organic Bee Farms RAW HONEY. Occasionally, I indulge in the more extravagant Tribute Xi Hu Long Jing tea; however, despite its exceptional quality, it is not feasible for daily consumption due to its cost.\n\nCons: My latest shipment deviated from the packaging shown on the Amazon page. The packaging I received prominently displays \"NATURALLY HIGH IN POLYPHENOL CATECHINS\" (a significant component contributing to tea’s possible health benefits), whereas the Amazon listing indicates \"CAFFEINE FREE.\" Consequently, I am uncertain whether this green tea is genuinely caffeine-free. Additionally, a minor inconvenience I encounter is that occasionally the tea bag tears when I unwind the string. To prevent this, if the string appears adhered to the bag, I immerse it in hot water to detach it safely.",
    "This is undoubtedly one of the finest teas I've ever had. It's crisp, vibrant, and refreshing. Excellent delivery and consistent quality. Give it a try!",
    "I absolutely love this green tea. It is very difficult to find in our area, and some online stores charge a high price while providing fewer boxes than this seller. I will definitely order from this merchant again. Thank you! I rely on my daily green tea fix!",
    "I'm a big fan of this tea. It really helps me control my appetite throughout the day. My Mom and I have shared it with all our friends to let them experience it too.",
    "As an Italian who lived in Italy for many years, I used to enjoy these cookies with my daily breakfast espresso. After moving to the Bay Area, I couldn't find them anywhere. It's wonderful to have them again.",
    "In the 1980s, I had the pleasure of spending multiple summers in Italy. Among the delightful culinary traditions there, biscotti often graced the breakfast table or served as a perfect mid-day treat. These simple yet delicious cookies were a rarity in the US at that time. They were so irresistible that on my recent trip to Italy, I couldn't resist bringing back two bags. It's wonderful that they're now available on Amazon! \n\nNote: There's something truly special about opening a fresh bag, breathing in the aroma, pouring a glass of milk, and dipping the Macines in. It's a fantastic routine and a delightful treat for children!",
    "I first heard about this product from our local pet store and decided to give it a try with a small bag for our two cats, aged 3 and 6. Our younger female cat loved it immediately, and surprisingly, our older male cat – who typically resists any diet changes due to being raised on low-quality cat food – enjoyed it as well.\n\nThe older male cat is overweight and we were trying to transition him to soft food on the vet's advice, but he refused. He has refined tastes and is quite particular. Despite his high calorie intake, at least I know he's eating nutritious food now. Although this product is more expensive than many other brands, I prefer it over the poor alternatives marketed as healthy. It puzzles me why some commercials promote vegetarian cat food that's mostly cornmeal. It doesn't seem right to me. For now, I’ll stick with this product and keep you updated.\n\nAfter nine months of using this cat food, I've decided to upgrade my rating from 4 to 5 stars. Both cats are thriving on it. Garfield, the older male, still eats a bit too much, but he’s a large, sedentary cat. The female cat, who will be 4 soon, is healthy, happy, and agile despite her small size. We tried the chicken version of Holistic Select, but Garfield missed this sardine flavor, so we switched back. I’ve also ordered the duck version and will provide an update once they try it.",
    "I began purchasing this after noticing that my 1-year-old cat was already losing his energy. I decided it was time to switch to high-quality cat food instead of the junk available at supermarkets. Among the countless options at the pet store, I chose this brand to try first, and it turned out to be an excellent decision. My cat has been eating it for the past 8 months, and he is now as active as he was as a kitten, with an incredibly soft coat. Most importantly, he loves the taste! I highly recommend this brand to all my friends and family for their pets.",
    "I've spent a lot of time researching the best food for my cat, and Holistic Select has truly impressed me. My holistic veterinarian also highly recommends it. What stands out to me is that they add probiotics to the kibble as the final step, which I find crucial. The best part is my cat took to it right away—she loved it so much that I had to stop mixing it with her old food because she refuses to eat anything else!",
    "My vet recommended this cat food because my 13-year-old Cleo was struggling to keep any food down and was losing weight. It resolved her issues completely. She now eats less but seems more satisfied, which helps justify the higher cost. Additionally, it aids in digestion, eliminating any unpleasant odors. I wanted to mention this so that anyone experiencing similar problems with their cats can see the numerous benefits of this cat food.",
    "I have a 4-year-old male cat with chronic UTIs. Feeding him this dry food, along with wet food mixed with water and Uri Ease, keeps his infections in check. Switching to other dry foods worsens his condition. Despite the cost, this diet works best for him, and my other cats enjoy it too.",
    "Before I learned about feline nutrition, my cats were totally hooked on dry cat food. I used to offer both canned and dry options, but now I wish I had stuck to premium canned food and cut back on the dry stuff. \n\nI have two spry 15-year-old cats and two energetic 5-year-olds. The only top-notch dry foods they liked were Wellness and Innova... until Innova's manufacturer got snapped up by Procter & Gamble. Then I was on a mission to find a worthy replacement. \n\nAfter testing out a bunch of new samples from my go-to holistic pet store, the only contender that passed the sniff test (apart from Wellness and Innova) was Holistic Select. So, if you have picky cats like mine, give Holistic Select a try. It's top-quality and perfect for those feline food critics.",
    "My holistic veterinarian suggested this and several other brands. After trying them all, my cats favor this one, particularly the sardine flavor. The standout benefit is that their coats are incredibly soft and clean, and their eyes are noticeably clear. Additionally (and I mean this as politely as possible), their waste has a much milder smell compared to cats fed the low-quality food from most stores, which is a huge advantage for me! The health benefits are clear, and I highly recommend Holistic Select!",
    "One of my cats is allergic to fish and beef, and this formula is one of the few she can eat. It has better ingredients than vet-prescribed diets. Both my cats are active, have shiny fur, and are in good shape. The dry food also helps reduce tartar buildup on their teeth.",
    "Our cats exhibit exceptional health and vitality on this dry cat food. We have observed a significant reduction in hairball incidents, and their fur is now extraordinarily healthy and glossy. They maintain a fit physique without any issues of being overweight. Furthermore, this vendor ensures remarkably swift shipping and ranks among the top suppliers on Amazon in our estimation!",
    "I have long been an enthusiast of Hot & Spicy Maruchan Ramen. If you appreciate spiciness and have an affinity for ramen, this product is highly recommended. Unfortunately, the price on Amazon is considerably higher. At my local Walmart, the cost is merely $3.36 for a pack of twelve.",
    "Ever since I was a child, I've enjoyed Ramen noodles, but no flavor has ever surpassed Hot & Spicy Chicken! While it might not be particularly hot for a chili aficionado like me, its taste is unmatched!",
    "I LOVE spicy ramen, but man, it really messes with my stomach and the burning feeling sticks around for like 3 hours! Not sure if that's normal or what... By the way, you can snag this at Walmart for just $0.28, way cheaper than Amazon.",
    "Having always been an enthusiast of ramen as a convenient and simple meal, discovering it on Amazon at a reasonable price and having it delivered to one's doorstep by the case presents an extraordinary opportunity.",
    "This soup tastes unbearably spicy, almost like fire. Normally, I enjoy spicy food if it has good flavor, but this soup lacks it. The intense heat overpowers any taste.",
    "I really enjoyed the spicy flavor of these. Surprisingly, I preferred the broth over the noodles, which is unusual for me. If you're not accustomed to spicy foods, this might be too intense, but if you love very hot foods, it might not be spicy enough.",
    "I snagged these on sale for about 25 cents a cup, which is half of what my local grocery stores charge, and they almost never have the spicy flavors. These are perfect for a quick snack at the office when I'm too busy to grab a real meal. This flavor of Instant Lunch is one of my favorites, and I'll definitely stock up whenever it's on sale.",
    "I've purchased many varieties, and this one stands out as a favorite. I'll be getting more shortly.",
    "I love this ramen flavor! Other flavors taste bland by comparison. With prime, I get it delivered in two days without paying for shipping, but it's still cheaper to buy a case at the grocery store.",
    "The best investment I've made for ginger! It's fibrous and spicy like real ginger, but the sugar balances it perfectly. Totally worth $40 for 5lbs. I'll be getting more soon to top my ginger cupcakes and cookies!",
    "This ginger is absolutely delicious. Unfortunately, I cannot find Australian ginger in my local area. However, this ginger compares very favorably to the Australian ginger I've bought in other cities. Now, I can savor its amazing taste without the need to travel.",
    "I keep experimenting with other, cheaper brands—what a mistake! This ginger is absolutely worth every penny. It's tender, moist, and consistently perfect.",
    "My son has had acid reflux since birth and tried all available medications with no improvement. An older gentleman recommended this product, so I ordered it for him, not expecting much. To our surprise, by day 2 of eating one piece of this ginger each morning, his symptoms disappeared. He can now eat anything and enjoy it. This product was a godsend for him. Thank you!",
    "I acquired this for our office to provide a delectable treat for colleagues to enjoy. Its bite-sized nature makes it more convenient for individuals to take a few pieces rather than an entire licorice stick. My sole criticism is that one of the bags ruptured during transit.",
    "Twizzlers brand licorice is far superior to other well-known brands. If you can find them for $2 to $2.50 per package with free shipping, it's a great deal. The black and cherry flavors are delicious, but the strawberry flavor is too subtle and barely noticeable.",
    "I absolutely love these – they’re so tasty! In fact, I think I’m hooked on them. Buying them in packs of six is much more cost-effective than getting individual bags at Target, saving about $1.00 per bag. I use the subscribe and save option for these and a few other products, and I love it!",
    "If you're seeking a cleaner option of licorice for children, be sure to try these! They are soft, easy to chew, and won’t leave your hands sticky—whether in the car, during summer outings, or at the beach. We love all the flavors and often mix them with chocolate for a delightful snack. Excellent product at a great price—highly recommended!",
    "I could be wrong, but it seems like the pieces in this bag have shrunk. If that's the case, it was probably done to make it look like you're getting more for your money with all those pieces. The issue is, the pieces need to be a certain size to pack enough flavor for a satisfying experience. Now, you need 2 or 3 pieces to equal the old size, and it's just not the same.",
    "As a long-time admirer of Newman's Pineapple salsa, I was on the hunt for a similar option. This one ranks among the tastiest salsas I've ever tried. My daughters are also fans. They aren't fond of overly chunky salsa, and the Berry Mango offers a pleasant smoothness with small bits of mango. The salsa strikes the perfect balance of sweetness and carries a mild yet delightful kick. At this price, it's a great deal!",
    "The salsa had a delightful aroma, suggesting it was indeed appetizing. However, it appears that the packer(s) at Amazon had insufficient packing materials, particularly for the bottoms of the bottles. As a result, the bottoms of all three bottles were broken. Upon attempting to process a return via my computer, I was informed that returns are not accepted for food items. Subsequently, I sought out a customer service option, but found none available on their newly redesigned website. While Amazon may take pride in their website's new appearance, it is crucial for them to provide a contact method for emergencies. Given my history of frequent purchases, which always arrive in secure styrofoam boxes, it is perplexing that glass salsa bottles were shipped in a cardboard box with only a strip of large bubble wrap for protection. Regardless of the care taken by the carrier, such as FedEx, breakage is inevitable with such inadequate packaging, particularly for glass containers.\n\nBarbara L. S.",
    "This is undoubtedly one of the finest salsas I have discovered in a long while; however, I would advise avoiding the variety pack. The other two salsas included in the pack are not worth the expense.",
    "These remind me of dog treats I once made with pumpkin and cinnamon. They’re somewhat bland and not my favorite Back To Nature product. However, my fiancé really loves them, which is why I gave them three stars.",
    "This cornmeal is exceptional. I used it to make traditional cornbread and hot water cornbread, and both turned out fantastic. I also fried some oysters with it, and the texture and flavor were incredible.",
    "This marinade is fantastic! I use it for both baked and grilled chicken. It's so flavorful that I've served it at dinner parties and received great reviews. It's definitely worth the price—affordable and easy to use. I love it!",
    "Suitable for chicken, fish, beef, or pork. Efficient, straightforward, and delivers exceptional flavor. Additionally, purchasing in bulk offers savings of over 50% compared to retail stores.",
    "I purchased this for my brother, who adheres to the Jorge Cruise diet, and decided to sample one myself. To my surprise, it is quite palatable.",
    "These singles typically cost just $2.50 to $3.36 for a box of 24 at the store, so it's perplexing why Amazon is charging $9.99 for the same product. Hazelnut coffee creamer is my favorite, but at that price, it's definitely not worth the purchase.",
    "Amazing flavor! I bought it as a healthier dessert option, and I'm so glad I did. There are countless ways to enjoy Jello desserts while keeping them tasty and nutritious. I will definitely be purchasing this product again because the flavor was fantastic.",
    "I visited 4 stores to find watermelon Jello for my green tomato jam recipe and finally found it here. It's usually available only in summer, so it was hard to find in the Fall. The Jello makes delicious watermelon jam and is great on its own too. Yummy!",
    "Certainly! Here's a more professional version of the text:\n\n\"This product offers exceptional value and is the healthiest type of salt available. One box should easily last our family an entire year. Unlike regular salt, iodized sea salt does not contribute to elevated blood pressure.\"",

    "I was tired of the typical Starkist and Chicken of the Sea pouches, so I tried SAFCOL, a brand I hadn't heard of before. I was pleasantly surprised; it tasted better and had less seasoning than the others.",
    "These are hands down the best-tasting tuna packs available, in my opinion. They make an excellent on-the-go snack and are incredibly satisfying, especially with the tomato.",
    "I have consistently purchased Star-Kist tuna; however, I decided to try this brand to explore a different option. Unfortunately, I found the flavor of the tuna to be unpalatable, as it contained an excessive amount of basil and other spices.",
    "As a tuna enthusiast, I decided to try the Safcol brand despite not knowing it well. The tuna itself is high quality, but the tomato basil flavor felt a bit bland. While it’s an upgrade from plain tuna, it didn’t have the kick I expected. Nonetheless, it's an excellent low-calorie, low-fat meal option.",
    "I thought it was far more delicious than the regular tuna pouches available. Top-notch quality, with no need to add anything.<br /><br />I heated it in the microwave at 20% power for 1 minute, and voila!<br /><br />I think a bit of warming enhances the flavor.",
    "This product was quite tasteless, to be honest. While there are better-tasting options available, it's worth noting that at just 100 calories, it's a healthier choice compared to a Special K bar or a cookie snack pack. You might need to season it or mix it with something else to enhance the flavor.",
    "I recently discovered pomegranate molasses and couldn't resist giving it a taste! I haven't cooked with it yet, just sampled a bit here and there, but let me tell you, it's amazing! It's rich, thick, tangy, and a bit sweet. Just a small taste and I don't even miss dessert. The flavor is so unique, with this interesting hint of metal that I actually love. Seriously, yum! Can't wait to try making fesenjan with it next :-)",
    "Incorporated into Moroccan dishes, as a delightful syrup in an exquisite cocktail, and elegantly drizzled over orange slices infused with orange water. Truly marvelous!",
    "I am uncertain how long these beans languished forgotten on some remote shelf, but they have aged to the point of being unfit for cooking. Regrettably, I was compelled to discard half of them due to compromised skins, a definitive indicator of beans well beyond their optimal period. The option of returning the product or requesting a refund is unavailable, as food items are non-returnable. Hence, I will seek out an alternative brand henceforth. Unfortunately, I am now faced with discarding approximately fifty servings of beans.",
    "Despite being smaller than runts, they share the same appearance and consistency. Unfortunately, their flavor is nothing like banana runts and, in fact, is quite unpleasant. Disappointing product. Attempting to arrange a return with the vendor.",
    "Overall, the item was alright, but the Banana Heads are much tinier than Banana Runts. Also, the packaging was pretty bad. The Banana Heads spilled out during shipping and were scattered all over the envelope.",
    "Certainly! Here's a more professional version of your text:\n\n\"I purchased these items as giveaways for a jungle-themed baby shower, and they were perfect for filling 25 small bags of candy. I bought 5 pounds of candy for this purpose. If you need to prepare more than 25 small bags, I would recommend purchasing a larger quantity.\"",
    "I've been enjoying Ricore ever since my mother permitted me to have caffeine, and I absolutely love it with milk. It's much smoother and tastier compared to instant coffee with milk. As a French citizen living in the US, I make sure to bring back boxes of Ricore whenever I get the chance. Another hidden gem worth trying is Savora. Give it a try.",
    "I first tried this drink when my mother brought it from her visit to Brittany, France, and I thought it was delicious! I wish it were a bit cheaper, but otherwise, I love this product!",
    "I was bursting with anticipation to try the 8\" Cinnamon Coffee Cake—a delightful confection made with farm-fresh eggs, luscious sour cream, exotic Madagascar Bourbon Vanilla, and enveloped in a divine cinnamon streusel. Imagine my excitement discovering this gem available online for just $18.95!\n\nHaving sampled countless cinnamon coffee cakes over the years, I can confidently say that the FantasiCakes Cinnamon Coffee Cake truly \"takes the cake\" in terms of size, value, quality, and flavor.\n\nWhen the cake arrived, it was swiftly delivered and meticulously packaged, ensuring it reached me in near-perfect condition. To my delight, it came with a generous tub of white icing for drizzling, allowing for that final, luxurious touch before serving. The cake's impressive size easily satisfied my family of five for three entire breakfasts.\n\nUpon slicing into the cake, I was met with a thick, moist texture reminiscent of a sponge cake, yet more substantial. The flavors were utterly heavenly, with sticky cinnamon gliding over the outside and a sweet swirl of cinnamon and vanilla woven throughout the cake's heart. The icing crown added an extra layer of moisture and sweetness, making each bite unforgettable.\n\nPair this delectable creation with your morning coffee, and you've stumbled upon the perfect breakfast treat.",
    "I used to love this brand's water and lemon juice, which I stopped drinking about 5-6 years ago. The product used to be incredibly strong; just a sip would give me an invigorating boost. However, it seems like the formula has changed over the years, possibly with added water or other adjustments, resulting in a less potent taste. The stronger the product, the less you need to use, which I appreciated. Although the quality is still good, the flavor now resembles cheaper brands. Despite this, I still enjoy this lemon juice and would recommend it. I just miss the intense, zesty sensation it used to provide.",
    "This is one of the best lemon juices I've tried, and its high quality keeps me coming back. When fresh lemons are out of season, this product perfectly meets our citrus needs for cooking and beverages. I'll definitely keep buying it.",
    "This lemon juice is essential in my kitchen year-round. Its powerful flavor requires only a small amount to enhance a dish. I add a spritz to my water daily and will keep buying it.",
    "Lightning-fast delivery and top-notch product! This lemon juice concentrate is exactly what you find in stores, and it's incredibly convenient for enhancing sauces, dressings, and more. No more hassle of squeezing fresh lemons every time or ensuring you always have them on hand.",
    "It's not as excellent as the Frozen Lemon juice, but it's still decent. There's a slightly off taste, possibly from a preservative. I really wish I could order the frozen juice!",
    "I was amazed to discover just how calming this beverage is. Honestly, it's perfect for winding down before a nap or bedtime. It's not advisable to consume it if you need to drive or engage in any active tasks.<br /><br />I can literally feel a soothing sensation in my arms and legs. Before long, my eyelids grow heavy and I feel transported to a place of deep relaxation.<br /><br />I absolutely adore this drink.",
    "I snagged these at Grocery Outlet in the Seattle-Tacoma area for an unbeatable deal – just $4.00 for a case of twelve! That's right, only 3 for a dollar instead of the outrageous $38.00. The flavor is decent – not fantastic, but definitely not terrible – and they’re low in calories too. I’ll definitely grab more, but only if I can dodge that crazy price tag!",
    "This product is truly impressive. The flavor is excellent, and it functions just as advertised. It's a wonderful natural sleep aid. Highly recommended!",
    "We've been searching for natural solutions to improve our sleep amidst the stress and bustle of our hectic lives. While taking a yoga class might be the ideal option, this product comes in as a close second. It helps you fall asleep quickly and stay asleep throughout the night. I drank half the first night, which was more than enough for me, and within 30 minutes, I was ready for bed. I woke up feeling refreshed and without the groggy aftereffects of sleep medications—definitely a major plus.\n\nHowever, I only rated the product 3 stars instead of the 5 it deserves because of the subpar packaging. The shipment arrived with 2 broken bottles, resulting in a $6 loss considering the price. The bottles are made of glass and were only wrapped with a single layer of small-bubble bubble wrap inside a larger box with extra room, allowing them to move around. This was a significant packing failure, but the product itself is fantastic.",
    "We baked chocolate chip cookies using BRM Garbanzo Bean Flour, and the results were amazing! The brown sugar and chocolate completely masked the bean flavor mentioned in other reviews. Our friends couldn’t tell any difference from traditional chocolate chip cookies. The texture, body, and elasticity (i.e., reduced tendency to crumble like most other gluten-free flours) were nice and chewy, just like cookies made with regular flour. An added bonus is the high protein and fiber content (estimated 2-3 grams of fiber per cookie), which makes you feel full with smaller servings and has a significantly lower glycemic index.\n\nI highly recommend this flour, even if chocolate chip cookies are the only thing you make with it.",
    "This product is fantastic! I baked some delicious banana bread with it. It's high quality and the best price around.",
    "We couldn't find this locally, but the delivery was fast, so now we don't have to search all over the flour aisle at our grocery stores.",
    "Unveil the magic of European-style fresh fruit tarts with this enchanting packet of glaze! I'm about to craft a stunning creation for a church pie auction, spurred by a friend's heartfelt plea for something strawberry. This glaze transforms a simple tart into a showstopper, making it easy to assemble a healthy, mouthwatering dessert. Just bake a base, layer it with luscious fresh fruit, and pour over this magical mixture. It sets at room temperature, ensuring the fruit stays perfectly in place while showcasing its natural beauty. I've seen it grace cheesecakes too, encasing fruit in a glistening layer that's breathtaking, even for someone like me who finds cheesecake a bit too rich. \n\nImagine thinly sliced lemons, poached in sugar syrup, arranged over a cheesecake, glistening beneath a crystal-clear glaze—an unforgettable delight. For my tarts, I favor a sponge cake base baked in a shallow form, but a French pastry called pate sucre, akin to a sugar cookie, also works wonders. Create mini-tarts in a muffin pan by pre-baking pie crusts or pate sucre. Each bite-sized tart can be filled with berries and topped with this magical glaze. Some even add a layer of creme patisserie, a delightful pastry cream stabilized with flour, beneath the fruit, taking the taste to new heights.\n\nIf baking calls to you, this glaze is a must-have staple. Its vegan-friendly ingredients—tapioca starch, carrageenan, dextrose, cream of tartar, and locust bean gum—make it perfect for not just traditional tarts but also inventive creations like vegan tofu cheesecakes with nut crusts. Embrace this glaze, and let your desserts captivate and enchant.",
    "My Scotties had hot spots, but within a week of using this, they were gone. The smell is strong but tolerable.",
    "I purchased this coffee since it's significantly more affordable than Ganocafe, plus it contains organic reishi mushroom and other beneficial antioxidants. I was surprised by how good it tastes! I've only been drinking it for a few days and at just $5, it's definitely worth it. My sisters all use Ganocafe, but I'm now introducing them to this budget-friendly alternative. I'll provide an update on this product in a few weeks. :)",
    "The coffee is finely processed, but the flavor is simply average. In comparison, Nescafe and Mount Hagen offer superior options. I purchased this product to explore alternatives, but I am unlikely to repurchase it. Although there is a subtle \"vitaminy\" taste, it is not overpowering. Additionally, the product is somewhat expensive relative to its quality.",
    "This coffee is fantastic because it's made with all organic ingredients! No need to worry about pesticides, it tastes delicious, and you get the healing benefits of ganoderma.",
    "Just like others have raved, this coffee boasts an exceptional taste. I've experimented with various instant coffees, but this one truly stands out. If you're eager to explore another fantastic option (though not organic), give 'Africafe Pure Instant Coffee' a try—it's one of my top picks!",
    "This product tastes amazing and boosts my energy without causing jitters—I absolutely love it! However, I wish it came in a resealable jar or durable plastic container instead of a zip-lock pouch. The zip-lock eventually ripped and stopped working. Despite the packaging issue, the product itself is fantastic.",
    "These tiny treats are absolutely delicious and incredibly refreshing!\n\nI often opt for salads at lunch, but we all know they can wreak havoc on your breath. That's where these come in. I pop two of them after my meal (they’re petite, so why not?) and they do wonders for my breath.\n\nWhat’s even better is that they’re sugar-free! Sugar can actually encourage those pesky bacteria that cause bad breath, so these are a perfect alternative. They're so tasty, I almost consider them part of my meal.\n\nFor a great bulk value, these mints are a stellar choice. Highly recommended! Cheers!",
    "I have a stronger preference for these compared to the traditional Altoids; however, they come at an even higher price, so it's important that you truly enjoy them.",
    "These little tins of sugar-free mints were a fantastic find. They're perfect for on-the-go moments. With fifty mints per tin, they're just the right amount to carry along. Plus, they're better for your teeth compared to sugary mints. The price of twelve dollars was quite reasonable. They're also great for sharing. If you're in search of some mints, give these a try—you'll be glad you did.",
    "Pros:\n+ Great packaging, quick shipping, and a good price.\n+ Still has about a year before it expires, so plenty of time to enjoy and share all 9 boxes.\n+ Perfect texture—not too fresh like regular wintergreen and not powdery. It’s the real deal!\n\nCons: None!",
    "Be careful not to eat too many in one day, as they contain a laxative chemical.",
    "These mints pack a powerful punch with their bold flavor, and their pocket-sized convenience makes them the perfect on-the-go refreshment!",
    "This is an immense stockpile of them. I'm still using these and have many left. Far more efficient than purchasing one from the grocery store or convenience store every time you desire a mint.",
    "Even with small containers, they hardly ever fill them up. These little tins are less than half full, making the high price feel like a rip-off. Do they contain some rare ingredient as valuable as gold in those tiny squares? Or is it the classic cereal trick, where the contents \"settle\" during transport? Can manufacturers just be honest for a change?"
