    "Yeah, sorry for not writing for a whole there, but I've had a pretty busy weekend so far. I found out I have about 20 tests on Tuesday because my teachers are evil...but oh well. We had marching yesterday. It was cool. We stayed inside the whole time, and I got to play second part, so the music part will be really easy. I left early from marching at around 5:00, then went out to dinner with my friends (I made the plans before I knew about marching). So, dinner was fun. It was Kelly's birthday, so it was cool. Then we went to Kel's for a sleepover, and did bunches of neat stuff, and I went to sleep earlier than usual for a sleepover since I had to be at a Bar Mitzvah this morning. It was pretty neat. I have to do this project for CR, and we have to go to two different places of worship than our own. So, one is obviously a Jewish synagogue, and I think I'm going to go to a mosque for my other one, but who knows...so, this has been my only chance to write, and I actually have to go now, so I'll write more later...maybe.  *Ya di amore*",
    "Yeah, so today was ok, late arrival. I'm not in the mood to write much, so..I probably will end up writing a ton. I always end up doing that when I say I don't want to write much. Nothing interesting happened in any of my classes, and I only talked with a couple of good people including, \"You know who\"...except, you don't know who, \"You know who,\" is. Oh well, no one reads this thing anyway. I made it to the top of the rock climbing wall today. Kelly and I intend to conquer the whole wall. It'll be fun. Jazz was good fun as always...heh, and that's really it. Have a lovely evening everyone, and I am off to sleepyland. (I actually didn't write a lot. I'm shocked.)  *Ya di Amore*",
    "Thought- OK...so, I'm all for midgets and whatnot. I'm not all, \"down with midgets,\" but really, don't you think it'd be rude to say, \"Up with midgets?\"  ~Ya di amore~",
    "Yeah, so it's later. My parents found something constructive for me to do...clean. Grrr, why do parents always think of that constructive crap? It's really obnoxious. I'm sitting here enjoyig my time of peace, no homework, and listening to jazz...and all of a sudden, \"Hey catie, go clean.\" So, I say what I always say, \"Yeah sure, fine, I'll clean.\" (Of course I almost never do this,) except..the problem was, my mom came upstairs, and asked me all nicely and whatnot to clean with that momly voice that makes you feel really guilty. and so I trudge downstairs get the cleaning stuff, and clean the bathroom. Bleh! I can't stand cleaning. I think I should be a gold digger, and marry a rich guy so I can have a cleaning lady, and so I can hire a cook to make me peanut butter sandwiches all the time, and then when I get super duper fat, and this guy wants a divorce, it'll all be good, because I won't have signed a prenuptial agreement. So I'll still get half the assets. Now of course, I'll have to become a witch first in order to make a rich guy, or any guy for that matter marry me. But see...now you all know my plan, so I'll have to come up with a new plan. Oh well. Anyway, I really have nothing to write, but I'm not in the mood to talk to anyone, so I'm just writing. I wish I could go to the park. It's my favorite place in the world. I bring my mini disc thing-a-ma-bobber, and go on the swings, and think and swing at the same time. It really is a fantastic place to go when you need to be alone, and think about stuff...except when the little kids come, and they look at you like you're frankenstein because you're a big kid on a swing...so, they're all afraid to get onto that other swing. It drives them crazy, because I usually stay there for an hour or so. I love little kids. They make me laugh. :) Anyway, I've bored you enough, so I shall write more at some later time.  ~Ya di amore~",
    "Yeah, so this is just a place for me to vent about my, \"oh so horrible life in my bubble town.\" Sarcasm really is wasted online most of the time. I don't know why I bother with it. It either sounds like I'm a mean horrible person, or I'm serious. Oh well, anyway, today was surprisingly good for a Monday. I got a pretty good night of sleep last night, and actually did my homework. Went to school, sadly on the bus...but at least I got to sit alone. Why sit alone you ask? It's my only time to have, \"Alone time,\"  and I had my trumpet with me, so that kind of gets in the way. Anyway, I got to school, and of course said hello to everyone. Brandon was at least feeling a little better today which is good...except for the story that went along with it, which involved him, and ceramic (he, of course did not say that as politely.) Anyway, that was good. Carson came by to see me, and check on this alleged new mitten policy, and she wears mittens in school all the time, so of course she was upset. I made the rounds with her after that, saw cute Jake, a girl from Speech Team, and some other folks. The six minute bell didn't ring so I was a bit late getting to Wind Ensemble. Meh, it's ok. My trumpet section is crazy anyway. We were supposed to be doing sectionals, but that didn't exactly happen...we sort of got yelled at by A. I played my music theory composition (which was horrid)  but I'm glad I got it over with. Mrs. Kane yelled at us about our Lit Analysis papers...no F's but some D's...that'll be me. Anyway, rock climbing in gym today! Yay! It was super fun. I just want to do more of it. Ummm, then the rest of my day was even more uneventful than the first half, but I actually have no homework, so what am I supposed to do with my time? Something else productive? Psh. Yeah right. We didn't end up having combo, which of course...was excellent, because I can't solo...heh. We wont even go down that road, but anyway, then I came home, ate food, and here I am...being incredibly wasteful of my time, and writing this thing. I'll write more later...maybe...if anything actually happens. Anyway, I'm out for now.  ~Ya di amore~",
    ":o) Hey...it looks like Alex. You know, the nose taking up the whole face kind of thing!! Except the smiley is MUCH cuter!",
    "I'm baaack, well, sort of. I have a lesson soon, so I'm really not back for long, just looking for something to do to pass the time. Oh look! A penny! :) So, how was everyone's day? Makes ya think...well, makes me hink, (which is nearly impossible) of who actually answers back to the computer. I certainly do. Then again...I can be seen talking to Genevieve, my locker at school. You know what bugs me? No? Yes? Well, what bugs me (aside from the word, \"bugs,\") is parentheses. I use them all the time, but I don't know how to use them correctly. Grr, pooey. It's like the tootsie roll thing, except instead of, \"The world may never know,\" it's more like, \"Catie may never know because she's an idiot.\" OK...this will probably be a pretty abrupt change in subjects but someone just called me, and I completely forgot what I was writing about, and I don't want to take the effort to get back into the train of thought I was in before. Steve just called about chem stuff. He's such a cool kid, I love him. In a friend kind of way of course. :) He's also got the coolest hair. Chemistry...ah, I dislike it with a deep burning passon that eats away at the soul. No...not really, but..it is rather obnoxious. Well..we had the whole evening with humanities thing kast night. Yikes. It was...not great, lets just put it that way, and never bring it up again. Hmmm, this is odd. I have no homework for once, and I had a free afternoon. No jazz all week. This is both good and bad. I love jazz, and yet...it's nice to have free time. I wonder if anyone's noticed how completely random everything I've written on here is. Heh. More fun! You all know me...spontanious Catie. RAR! Ah, guess what? Guess...come on...I bet you aren't guessing...GUESS!!! Alright sorry, I'll just tell you. I went on high ropes yesterday, and made it across the swinging balance beam with Peter. Of course, Mr. Z finds something wrong in EVERYTHING we do, so...Peter and I didn't do it correctly. Evil. Hmmm...possibly I should go warm up for my trumpet lesson. Yes? No? Ah, that's super fun to say. I'm having so much fun writing random stuff thought. Oh well, more later maybe. You're all fantastic people if you've made it this far. Either that, or your just dumb and don't know that the little X in the upper right-hand corner gets you away from this madness.  *Ya di amore* :o)",
    "Wow, haven't written in a long time. Been pretty busy lately with Disney and then make-up work. Disney was a blast. Even the bus ride wasn't as bad as I expected it to be. it was actually kind of...well...fun. *Gasp* Yes well, I did enjoy myself at Disney, but it's nice to be home. I've created a theory about going on vacation with your friends. Don't. At least for more than two days. After about the second day, people started getting really sick of each other, and got very edgy. (Didn't help that the bus ride there was 31 hours.) Yes, well...I've finaly pretty much caught up with make-up work. Yay! I'm writing this feature story for journalism. I'm actually getting pretty into it. It's about Teenagers VS. Adults. It's pretty fun doing the research for it. Yes...but anyway....not talking about school anymore...it's evil. Our jazz band had a gig on Wednesday, and I got a ride, and was late getting there. I got there at the end of the last song...which is the song I had a soli in. Whoops...Oh well, it happens. Honestly, that's about all that's been going on, and now I'm off to the mall. I wish it would snow... *Ya Di Amore*",
    "Hehe, just finished dinner! Yum! I'm so happy right now. I don't even know why, I just...am! I'm talking to a bunch of my friends while writing this, which is always fun. Plus I'm doing homework, PLUS I'm watching Law & Order...how massively talented am I? Well, my day was pretty kick butt. Umm, no band OR music theory...very cool, so Kristen and I sat together and did homework and discussed Winter. Next period I hung out with Chris and Kelly for a bit (Alex too for a bit, since he was in Gym) and I left eventually. They started working on music, and...I just always end up feeling left out when they do, so, I try to stay away from those two together in general.Oh well, I went and sat alone in a practice room. Darn...no good stories for the newspaper to write about me. That was a great story, no matter how angry people are about the band comment. I wish people would have read the story actually, instead of reaching paragraph two and deciding it was terrible. Well, anyway, umm...EPVM was interesting. I'm getting nervous about my final. My brother said it was difficult...my brother with the perfect ACT AND SAT scores...arg. I just...wow, I'm so afraid of that test. I'm completely going to fail. Gym...oh jeez...two words  Commando Crawl  OWWWWWWWWWWWWWW  Good lord...that was one of the most painful...oh jeez...just thinking about it. Seriously, if you ever by some chance do that for high ropes...WEAR PANTS! Well, yes...wear pants normally, but don't wear shorts, make sure they are pants, because...it's quite painful if you don't. I made it through though, so it's all good! It just hurt...a lot.   Math, boring, shock shock.  Intervening thought: Why do I always write these while talking to Alex??  Lunch...was interesting. Just hung out with Kelly and Emily some, then Chris and Alex. It was cool...not much to it. Comparative Religion was boring...just, meh, presenting projects...and finally chem...boring, shock shock, and then, I came home, and did stuff, and that is the end of my day...therefore, I shall leave, and go kill alex...I mean...wait...you know NOTHING. You have no evidence...:)",
    "I got so many compliments on my hair! It was awesome, I got it cut, and layered last night, and I really really like it! It's shorter, but it's still really great! Right now I'm looking for new furniture for my room. I'm completely re-doing it, except for the floor. I like having a wood floor. Easier to clean if you spill something...which is inevitable with me. So, anyway. jusat waiting for dinner to be done, then all I have to do is study for my Science test. Arg...stupid science. Oh well, we have later arrival tomorrow! YES! I was hoping, and hoping, but I was upset because I wanted a late arrival day, and didn't think we had one, and then Bryan (with a y) was like, \"yeah, norkus you idiot!\" Ouch...oh well, how can one be sad when there's late arrival!?!?! Except, finals are next week, and I'm not ready at all. I should maybe actually study this time, considering I have not studied for finals yet since High School started....surprisingly though...I've done well. I don't get it. If I could just learn not to avoid homework, I'd be doing well. For most kids, it's the tests that make the problem, for me, it's the homework. Yay! Dinner...I'll write more later!..",
    "Avoiding homework...yet again, shock shock. plus i just painted my nails, and typing is something I can actually do without messing them up. I'll go back to homework in a bit. Umm, today was great! I saw *HIM* EEK! like four times. It was great...plus he actually NOTICED me, and spoke to me like...two out of the three times I talked to him. Exciting stuff.:) So, yes anyway, school wasn't bad. I went and sat with my best buds this morning instead of waiting outside the band room. It was fun. I miss seeing them as much as I do. Kathryn's doing well, she was just working on her paper, and of course Joanne and john were flirting. :) They make such a great couple. I get a little jealous at times though. I sort of wish I had someone like that. I'm still deciding who, and IF I want to ask someone to Winter. I would actually really like to go, but who to ask?? Certainly not *HIM* :) Couldn't do that. I figure I'll just go with a friend or something, and it'll all be good. OK...so, anyway, Kelly S. was cool as usual. She was complaining about stuff...as usual, but I love her to death just the same. Yeah, so...umm, went to band, Peter was gone, so...there wasn't AS much making fun of me as there usually is...oh darn. It was actually, ...scary as it is..., a bit unnerving. I actually got used to them all making fun of me every day, and it just wasn't balanced. Meh. Music theory was ok, but I'm still seriously thinking about dropping the class. I mean, I don't learn a lot, and I don't really enjoy the class too much. I could be doing more useful things with my time. Kelly..coyle that is got kind of angry with me about it. Oh well, I have to do what's best for me, and that may be what's best for me. EPVM...borring, as usual. We had a sub...so, whatever, nothing big. Gym..I went on high ropes!!! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!! I was sooooooooooooooooooooooooooo scared. You have no idea. It was terrible...except, fun! I was so scared when I first went up there, but Mehgan and I kicked booty! We got three done today. We could have gotten more if Allen hadn't been an idiot...arg. What a silly boy! He went up there just so he could come back down right away. That's the only reason he wanted to go up. So that wasted a good ten minutes. My watch fell off while I was up there and I totally flipped out! Eek! Kelly got pretty mad at Erica...I don't know...I hope no one's mad at me right now. I just really don't like when people are mad at me.   Math was...arg. I've finally learned the trick to his teaching though. He's actually a pretty darn good teacher if you can stay awake in his class. Eek, sorry, have to go...I'll write more when I get back from getting my hair cut :)",
    "Welp...haha, what a funny word, perhaps because it isn't a word? Yes, yes that is it. Well, anyway, I just finished my paper a bit ago, and now my mom is correcting it. Gulp! I've seriously forgotten how to write normally!!! Stupid Mrs. Kane, and her Journalistic style of writing! I can't write normally anymore, I really can't. I'm always like, \"Is that objective?\" Argh, so annoying! Well, I just vnted to Bryan with Y :) about jazz. I'm really trying to forgive Alstadt it just bothers me SO much. He never asked, never consulted me, didn't even TELL me for heavens sakes! I don't know, forgiving is the right thing to do though, so that's what I will do. This weekends been pretty cool actually. I'm feeling a lot better, and all I did this weekend was read...three books. Good books I might add. I also watched Pretty woman last night. Aww...it was so cute, almost makes me want to become a prostitute and look for love...except, not.  Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking. It is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil, but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails. -1 Corinthians 13:4-8  I love that...I do! It's so great, and so true. There was this other one I saw today...it's not exactly in the Bible, but I thought it was a GREAT quote nonetheless.  \"Be who you are and say what you feel, for those who mind don't matter and those who matter don't mind\"-Dr. Suess!  Again, so great and so true. Oh well, I really must go finish my conversation with Bryan with a Y, and then off to bed...ahh, sleep, I love you!! :) Ya di amore*",
    "Yeah, so avoiding homework right now and talking to Brandon. I'm really scared about this upcoming jazz competition. I know that we're not playing any songs that I really have to solo in, but still, there is Jumpin' at the Westside. I know I'm going to totally freak out...I just know it. Oh well. Anyway, I've been really sick for the past like...week. I'm getting sick of it..heh, sick of being sick. I first had a cold, then an ear infection...arg. Stupid sickness. Oh well...I'll come back and write more in a bit after I finish my paper. I'm determined to finish this thing.  Ya di amore...*",
    "RAR! OK, sorry, just love typing that! :) Well...just writing my music theory final...heh...last minute...rock on! Woo hoo! I had jazz today, I'm umm...doing better, I guess. When he pointed to me, I didn't like...bury my head and say, \"no, no, no! You can't make me!\" Oh well, s'all good. Umm, no finals today really. Lunch...went in at the end...then band (hardest final EVER) and then finally Comparative Religion...which, we didn't have a final in! yay! The rest of my day has been blah, so I'll write more later...maybe...if anything interesting happens. It wont though! :)",
    "OK, so I decided not to go. I talked to Chris about all that was bothering me, and it REALLY helped. Seriously, I love that kid to pieces. He's one of the best people to talk to when you're upset and need someone to listen to you complain. I really didn't want to tell him at first, but...he made me, and I'm glad he did. It felt good to get it out.I cried for the first time in a long time...perhaps since my Grandma's funeral...which was one of the things I was upset about. I just...really miss her a lot. I think I need to cry more...or get upset more, because, it just...hurts so much when it comes in big spurts, and...I don't know. I really want someone to like me for me...actually, I want someone to like me in general. I don't know what's so wrong with me...I really don't. I mean, sure...I'm certainly not good looking,but I'm not worse than some, and I try not to be a bad person, so...I don't understand it. Arg...I just...try so hard, and it feels like no one appreciates it, at all. Oh well, I'll be good tomorrow morning, it's just good for me to write, and talk to people I trust about this sort of thing, and it's not like anyone actually reads this thing anyway...so, heh. Anyway, off to bed. Goodnight.",
    "Once again...I'm upset about winter. Seriously, I keep telling myself to stop, because I'm being selfish, and I've got it better than like...99% of the population on this planet...and I'm complaining about a little dance, and it really is my own fault. I just should have asked someone. This is a real bummer. EVERYONE, and I do mean everyone has a date to this thing...RAR....must go...bye.",
    "Ok, tonight's entry is going to be pretty short. I'm really tired, and..I need a LOT of beauty sleep.  Today was a pretty ordinary day anyway. We had late arrival though, which was cool. Mr. Alstadt wont be here for the next two days...oh darn! I was looking forward to music theory SO much too! Well, yeah, anyway. Nothing interesting happened until I got called down to Mrs. Plumbers...DUN DUN DUN! I didn't do anything, just a mix up, so it's all good now! :)  Then, we had jazz, and I am going to kill Nathan. I wish he'd act more like a section leader, and Tom wont shut up. I think Steve ought to be section leader. He actually cares about sounding good. So...then i came home from jazz, had my lesson, and that was about it. I know this was completely boring, but people get mad if I don't write, then they yell at me, and...arg. So tedious. Oh well...I'm off to...errr, read, or something. then sleep.   Also, my great uncle Al died a few days ago. He was the coolest guy ever. :) So, if you could all say a prayer for his wife, and really close family, I'd appreciate it. :) Thanks everyone, have a nice evening.  XOXO",
    "I miss Heather. She was someone I could tell everything to. Wow do I miss her. :(",
    "Well, my day today was better than yesterday. It started out better though. I can usually tell what kind of day I'll have from the morning. I got my schedule changed today, and I straightened things out with Kathryn, so...she understands why now, which is good. I really didn't want her to be upset with me.   You ever feel like the whole world is against you, and hates you?? I hope not...it's not a great feeling. I feel like I have no real friends right now, no one that I can really turn to when times get rough, or when I'm upset. I miss Amanda, I miss Hillary, and I miss Kelly. I've just been so sad lately...and I'm not sure why. I guess I miss having a best friend, and...wow, I just really want a boyfriend. As pathetic as this all is, I do. I would think if I had a boyfriend, he'd be someone who listens to me, and...it's just not going to happen anytime soon. Yeah, I'm going to Winter now...but, now I realize it wasn't Winter that I wanted to go to...it was WHO I wanted to go with. I wanted to go with someone like I really liked...not a friend, and...it all just sucks right now. I kind of feel like crying, and...that's not me most of the time.   Yeah...so, feeling a little better, sorry...I was having an EXB moment. OOO, bad moment to have...very bad! Listening to some Dave Matthews...again, which is fun, so...yeah. Anyway...I have to go, people are actually IM'ing me. Drat. Maybe I'll write more later.  :I",
    "Well...ok...the Bucs won. Yay?? I'm not usually a big football fan, which is shocking considering everyone in my family loves football...and I'm in marching band. Man am I a weird kid. Well...anyway, we have a small problem now, I may be going to Winter...finally, like I wated, but...now Kelly's kind of out in the cold. :( We're thinking maybe she could go with Neil or something, since we all know Neil, and it'd be fun. We don't want to leave her out of this. I kind of wish that I could invite Kristen and Alex, and Taylor and her boyfriend, but...I'm not sure if Kathryn and Joanne would be cool with that. I'm just really confused right now. I can't believe we have school tomorrow. :( It feels like we don't...maybe because of the Superbowl, but...I don't know. I should probably just stop writing before I write something I don't mean to, which would force me to actually start looking at things with a different perspective. I still can't believe we actually placed yesterday...but, I really want to know how many bands there were....it's probably like marching. We got 5th...but...out of 5 bands. Whoops. Hehe. Except...that was last year, because this year...we rocked the kazba...and, I have no clue why I just said that. Wow...Catie, you're a weirdo. And now I'm talking to myself too...ok, sleep would be good now...yes...definitely...sleep...now...Good night all! Hope you have sweet dreams!!! :)",
    "Evereryone else is watching the superbowl,.so there's nothing else to do. I've been thinking about stuff. I said I wanted to go to Winter and everything...but, now that I am, I'm not sure if I really want to. Like, yeah...I asked him, but...I'm just going with him as a friend. I want to go with someone as more than a friend, someone I really do like. I mean...I love him as a friend, and I've known him for so long, but...I just wish I were going with someone I like as more than a friend. :( Oh well, it's still really nice just to be going. I wish it weren't so cold out, I need to go for a walk err, a bike ride or something! And just...think. I love people, I really do, but...I need my alone time. It was like poor Emily on the Disney trip. I just need to be alone! I'm actually getting sort of excited about Winter now. I'm talking to Joanne and Kristen, and they're excited for me...so...I'm getting excited too. I think it will be fun, especially with a group of people I like spending time with! Anyway...more later, I'm actually having conversations with people NOT watching the Superbowl! YAY!",
    "Wow...I can't believe it. I almost wish I could have seen more class AA bands. JSO didn't win any awards...which, completely shocked me. I mean...they are awesome. In the words of Alex, \"There must have been some seriously Godly bands if they beat JSO!\" But oh well...considering JSO isn't my band, we'll talk about Jazz Band...which places 3rd...probably out of 3 bands, but still. :) It was nice to place, and have JSO not...considering they're like...saintly, and...well...we suck. My soli went ok, not too bad. I guess I still have to play louder, and I didn't mess up any of the notes, messed up the timing a bit at 110, but..other than that, it was actually pretty good...I thought. Well, anyway...I'm not quite sure what's going on with Andy and Diane, but....it seems like Diane is happy, so...if she's happy, then I'm happy too. That's really all I wanted to write for right now. Haha, that amuses me. Write for right. OK...anyway, must be off to...I don't know...do something fun since there's no homework!!!! YES! :) Anyway, I'll write more later maybe.  :)",
    "Wow, I just...can't even write right now...I feel so terrible. All I have to say is that I'm an idiot.",
    "I couldn't sleep...I guess I get way too upset over stuff like this...but, I am REALLY upset. Supposedly Zach is in surgery, and Richa has internal bleeding...jeez. Why?? Supposedly there was also another accident in which a student died...it's all so depressing. I just want everyone to stay safe, and I really wish there was someone to talk to right now, but there isn't...everyone who would be online and who I could talk to is happily asleep. I seriously don't know whether to cry, or...what. I mean...I have cried...but, jeez, sometimes I wish I didn't care so much about people I don't know well. It wouldn't hurt as much if I only got upset over people I was really good friends with. It's just so unfair though. They're both so smart and nice...and....arg...just, why them??? Why the heck them....? I feel like I should tell the people I really care about how much I care about them, but...it's really hard for me to express my emotions like that. It makes me so sad though...so so so sad. I kind of wish I could go back to the days of elementary and junior high...at least people seemed safe there. No one ever got seriously hurt or died during either...  There's also that feeling like...I want to help somehow, but there's really nothing I can do. I mean...I'll pray, but somehow I feel that I should do something other than pray, something physical...I don't know anymore...maybe I just need to go clear my head....I was going to write about my day, but it doesn't really matter right now. I just hope they're ok...",
    "Why is it that bad things happen to good people?? I wish the quote, \"Good things happen to good people,\" was true, but it isn't always. Two really great people were in a car accident tonight, and they are in stable condition, but...still, it's terrible. They're upstanding people, and it shouldn't have happened to them. I hope they'll be ok, and I'll definitely be praying for them. They both contribute a lot to our school, and will continue to contribute a lot to the world when they leave High School. I guess I'm still trying to grasp onto the concept that bad things DO happen to good people...even if they're not just good people, but great people.   It also makes me incredibly grateful to have the life I have...to have a great family, have money, have shelter, have food, have friends, have...life. I just wish that it didn't take things like Kari's death...or Richa and Zach's accident to slap me in the face and make me realize it. I always get mad at people when I think they're being selfish or thinking too much about themselves, when I, myself, am probably being selfish.. But, I guess...as a friend just told me, \"It's times like these you have to have faith.\" I do. I mean, I say my prayers every night, but...a lot of times, I just say them to say them. I don't really think about who or what I'm praying for. I'll really think...and, I'll definitely be praying for Richa and Zach, and I hope other people can take the time to as well...",
    "i can't stop typing in this thing. I don't know why. My fingers wont stop. It's like they each have little individual minds of their own, except...I only type with two fingers. My two index fingers. I type pretty darn fast for that though. Lalalalalalala. Seriously, it is good to laugh a lot. Typing constantly is sort of keeping my mind off of truly thinking of the audition, and considering it all.   Hmmm. I'm talking with Brett, and Matthew. It's fun. I enjoy talking to both of them. I'm trying not to bring up the A audition though...   You know, I think I'd rather be known as prude and not be able to get guys, then a slut who can get guys. If I'm going to get herpes, I want to get it from someone I'm going to spend the rest of my life with.    Haha, sorry. I was just having a conversation about that with someone.  And I'm gone again...",
    "Sorry I sounded petty, and dumb and selfish.  I said haha a lot in that. Wow, it's good to laugh more. Hahahahahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahaha.  No seriously, am I always this loony?",

Haha. It made me happy. I think I'm going to make a list of things I don't like too but, I'll save that for my next really bad mood. I'm in a good mood now. The weather is actually semi-decent, and...hmmm, yeah! Oh well, I'm outta here for now. Peace. (I've always wanted to say that.)  XOXO :)",

    "Top Ten Reasons to Go Out With a Guy (These aren't in any real order.)  Intelligence Humor Kindness Good Morals Smells good :) Haha, had to be here. Good conversationalist. Fun to be around Being Hot. (Yeah, it's shallow, and it's not a necessity but, it is a plus.) Sensitivity. Yeah right, like this one's ever going to happen. Trustworthy.  Oh yeah! Just had a conversation with someone about this. Yeah, that'd be the perfect guy. Most definitely. Too bad none exist, or if they do, I'm just not noticing.  Anyway, my day was most excellent. I went to woodfield with my mom and shopped. Ah, it was so much fun. Hmmm, I think more people than I realize read this thing, so now I'm scared. I just put it on my profile for fun, except, now people know. They KNOW. Ahhh. Anyway, yeah.   Why do potentially good girlfriends pick terrible boyfriends, and vise versa? I've never understood it. Oy's so dumb. Almost as dumb as me but not quite.  So, I really have nothing to write, so...I think I'll stop now. Yep...stopping right.......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................now.",
    "Yeah, ummm, things are good. I made it. 5th chair, before Dan, haha, yes! I walked into band behind Dan, while Peter's saying, \"She beat you.\" Hahaha, the look on his face was the funniest thing I've EVER seen. It was so great. But yeah, I made it, and I'm happy about it, but...I'm still in a crappy mood. I want to go back to my old crazy self. I want to stop...being other people. I was having a conversation about this with a certain somone the other day, and he said he was doing that. Like...I take bits of other people's personality and make them me...It's so dumb. I need to be myself. I need to be crazy. I need to be fun. I need to not be shy. I need to be fun. I also need to be more trustworthy...but, that's a long way off. Maybe I am me. I'm really not sure. All I know is that I'm so incredibly confused about everything right now. I don't even feel like I care about the \"A\" audition. That's pathetic, I spent so much time worrying about it. I just feel like I care about nothing right now. I hate feeling that way.  Man, I'm just...not supposed to feel this way. I'm supposed to feel happy. Nothing's gone wrong, there's really nothing to complain about. I just...feel sad I guess.   Oh well, life goes on. I'm probably just having a bad day. Probably because it's cold out again. Argh, anyway, I'm off to go shopping with my mom at Oakbrook. Wow, I'm not even that excited about that. This is terrible. Oh well, I'm sure I'll have fun anyway.   I'll probably write more later. This is a writing kind of day...  XOXO",
    "Well, I'm really still not feeling bad for what I said. Jim mentioned it to me and thought I was talking about Dave K. Today. I was like, no no no no no! Haha. I actually thought Dave K. was mad at me today. It was weird...  Anyway, school was ok. Still didn't technically find out, but Mr. A. said I'm ok, and not to worry, so...I wont. Jazz was actually ok today, I was playing..and not THAT softly either! :) So, there's really not much to know about my day since it was boring and stuff.  I don't really feel like typing now actually. Nor later perhaps?   You know who it is, and if you don't, you're just not cool...  XOXO",
    "YES! I made Wind Ensemble, and I'm so happy...except, not really. I wish.  They didn't have the results posted today! Argh. I'm so mad. They said, \"We'll post them on Monday\" and then today they say, \"well, we're not quite done, we'll put them up tomorrow.\"  Argh.  Oh well, anyway. I must be off, just wanted to type about how frustrated I am that the results aren't out yet. :(",
    "Brilliant, absolutely brilliant!  Haha, I don't even know. I just had this huge urge to say that! Anyway, today's been better with thinking about the audition and stuff. I haven't thought about it as much, but yeah...dun dun dun.  Results come out tomorrow, but in the afternoon!!! Grrrrrrrrrr, that's so pooey. I just want to know for better, for worse.  Oh well, sucks to be me...except, not really. I like being me :)",
    "Wow, I was insane last night, and do you want to know why??? No, you already know why. I mentioned it 50 billion times last night. Ahhh...can't Monday come sooner??? PLEASE! Time is dragging by, and it's the weekend. Time on the weekend isn't supposed to drag by!  Well, I left for a while before finishing this to go read. I'm reading this book called Tangerine. I've read it like two times before, but, for some reason...I really like it. I don't know.  Anyway, there's nothing much else to write now. I don't think I'll end up doing anything today. My mom's leaving in a few hours for a business trip, so...yeah. Anyway, I think I'll go read more.",
    "Hm, haven't written in a while. Well, jazz cafe was last night. It was most excellent. I was really very surprised.. I wasn't expecting to have fun at all. I didn't even want to go. I danced all through JSO playing. It was super fun. Heh, anyway, I really have nothing more to say. I think I'm gonna go actually. I'll prolly write more later.   G'night you princes and princesses.  :)",
    "Wow, I am in such a better mood. I just talked to Christopher for like...2 hours. Man, I love that kid haha. He put me in the best mood. He's like my brother. It rocks like no other! :)  Goodnight you princes and princesses!  XOXO",
    "I just noticed...my entries have been getting more frequently sad. Because I've been more sad, or because I've actually been being honest with myself for once and admitting I'm upset?",
    "We go on...through the joy and through the tears. We go on...to discover new frontiers.....  I miss Disney Word so so much :(   I bet I'd be happy if I were there right now.",

    "Yeah, it's kinda like that...                 But not really. :)    Haha, sorry. I really had no purpose for writing that. I'm just sort of avoiding doing this government crossword puzzle. Man, it's taking for fricking ever!!! Holy cow. It's not even funny. This thing is impossible, and it's worth more than the test. Heh. YaY government? RAR! OK, anyway, I think my weekend on average was pretty decent. I really didn't do all that much. Just kinda hung out. I cleaned my room though!! Like...really cleaned, I washed my floor (since it's hardwood) and cleaned all my furniture and everything! It's amazing. Except, it's all weird, because everything's all neat, and everything's where it's supposed to be. It's confuzzling. Ah, I love making up words. So much fun. It turns out I didn't have a gig according to Brandon. He better be right, haha. Yeah, so, umm, I think I was supposed to do something with Kathryn today, but...I ended up going to lunch and stuff. Oopsies. I hope she isn't too mad. I talked to her on the phone for a while, and she seemed ok, but...kinda mad since she knows about Joanne, Diane, and me going out to lunch. Eeks. Oh well, we'll do something this upcoming weekend. Haha. Coffee smells good. Matthew and I are talking about coffee. I think I'm the only person who doesn't actually like the taste of it. I like the smell though, so good enough. Can you tell I'm rambling? I know I can. I'm procrastinating like no other. Oh well...back to the drudgeries of doing homework. :(  XOXO",
    "I think I upset Diane. I asked her a lot of questions about being vegetarian today. I didn't mean for them to upset her. I've just never known anyone who is vegetarian so, I sort of wanted to know about it. I was just curious, that's all. I hope I didn't upset her. I hope she's jjust having a cranky day or something. Haha, no..I don't hope she's having a cranky day. I hope she's having a great day, but...she seems to be kind of upset. I just hope it wasn't me.",
    "Sometimes I really wish people didn't read this, and other times, I do. People actually hear..or see what I have to say with this thing, but...that's not necessarily a good thing. Hmmm, I'm talking with Andrew. Haha, he thinks I'm a creepy kid. This is funny.  Anyway, umm, I think I might have a jazz gig, but I have no clue.Eeks. Oh well, they can't blame me when I knew nothing about it! AHHH!  So, I went out to lunch with Diane and Joanne today. It was a lot of fun. I felt kind of bad though, because Diane and I were talking about all this marching stuff, and Joanne doesn't know about it and stuff. Every time I'm with band people I do that, and I really don't mean to, because I feel like I'm making people feel so left out when I do that. It was fun though, reminiscing. I kind of miss freshman year, but 'eh. Not that much. I like sophomore year too. It's cool. Hehe, anyway. Must be off. Heh, seriously, if I hadn't gone crazy years ago, I probably would now...  XOXO",

    "You know, I was just thinking, Harry Potter needs an invisibility cloak to get around Hogwarts at night, but, even though I have white hair, I'm still invisible to most. Most of the time I feel like second best, or third. With the exceptions of a few people, like Kelly and Emily for example. Yeah, they're best friends, but they ALWAYS make me feel like I'm just as important to both of them as they are to each other. But, then there's some people who seem to always make me feel like I'm not good enough. Like, \"oh, I guess we'll call you after we make sure everyone else isn't busy.\" Argh. It's just not cool. I try to ignore it, but it's difficult. Oh well..just...a though.  XOXO",
    "I didn't think I'd be this upset over my brother leaving. :( I'm really upset about it. He just left, and...I don't know. I'm going to miss him a lot. It just makes me sad to think how little time I really have left to spend with my family. I'll be going off to college in two years, and then start my own life, and my own family from there on. I'm one of very few people who actually enjoys spending time with my family. I really get along with them. They get me away from the shallow selfishness of High School. They have actual intelligent conversation. I'm just...sad :(",
    "Hm, ok, so, there really isn't anything else to do. So, I decided, I'd just keep typing until either my mommy calls or gets home. I'm going out to dinner with my family tonight. It's my brother's last night here before he goes to Australia tomorrow. I think I'm actually going to miss him a lot. He's there for me a lot, and I can actually talk to him. It's kind of surprising. :( Oh well, at least I'll have my bathroom to myself, but that's not enough. I'd rather have my brother here I think. I don't know, I've just gotten so much closer to him in the last few months and stuff.   Anyway, back to non-depressing stuff. Oh wait, my day was sad. Haha, not totally actually, just my speech. It was so bad. I'm never practicing for a speech again. It messed me up. That, and bringing my whole outline up there with me. Oh well, I don't think I really wanna talk about it/write any more about it. Too painful to think of.  I wore a skirt. I like skirts, but I don't. It's weird. Anyway, my mom just called. She's on her way home from the airport, YaY! I'm off to....I don't know, get a life.  Byebye!",
    "Still can't get to it. the servers are too busy. I can sign in and stuff, but I can't put an entry in. Poo.",
    "Oh my gosh. Professor Semanic can eat flamingo poo! ARGH! I DID let him know I wasn't going to be there for jazz cafe with an e-mail, and he wasn't able to do it anyway! What the heck is that mans problem? He has a huge one. RAR! Sorry, just a little angry. I don't think he's fair or justified, and he's yelling at us for not having consistency in rehearsals and...heh, guess what? HE CANCELLED FOR THE NEXT TWO WEEKS! Wow that man makes me mad, but...yeah, oh well. I can't write in my real diary because I can't get to it. My real diary is online, but...it's locked and whatnot...so, yeah. I can't get to it, that makes me mad too. :( Oh well, I think I'll go try again.",
    "Oh yeah, that gig last night, did NOT do wonders for my self esteem. It loweered it. Stupid gig, we did horribly. RAR! Anyway, the gig tonight went well and all. It was kinda fun. Kelly drove me, and on the way home we stopped at McDonald's. It was so cool! So, we got some chow, and then rode home listening to the soundtrack to Now and Then. We sang really loudly and I danced. It was soooo fun!! I love Kelly S. I love Kelly C too! Kellys just rock my world basically!   Anyway, I swear, I really will stop writing in here.     Maybe?",
    "Yeah, so, today was pretty ordinary.  Hmmm, I don't even remember half of what I did today. I was so out of it. Haha, i wore my black hoodie with the hood up, and nobody could recognize me at first because they usually go by the hair. I also looked pretty stoned. Like, five people this morning told me I looked stoned. It was funny.   Oh, the juniors might have to take the ACT all over again. Man, that'd suck so much. Supposedly four ACT answer booklets were stolen. they had an assembly about it and everything. It's all pretty messed up.  Man, I hate group work so much in math. It's the most messed up thing in the world. GRRRR!   I completely lucked out on my government packet today. I don't really wanna explain how, but...I felt I needed to thank someone for letting me get 33/35 when I did the packet after the tes right before we graded it in ten minutes. Too much to explain, but it was excellent. Anyway, I think I'm sick of typing in this public area again, so...I think I'm going for the whole private diary again. I still type in there, but i also type in here. I think maybe I'll just type in there from now on, because two entries is too much for a lazy person like me.",
    "OK, so, I'm indecisive. I decided that I wouldn't stop writing in here, well...for now. I just decided to write in here today instead of my actual journal. Who knows why? My mind works in mysterious ways.  Anyway, school was ok today, nothing too special. I saw a lot of my friends, and had a good talk with Emily over lunch. I think Dave saw that one entry in here, because he's been a lot nicer to me in the past couple days, or at least since Jazz Cafe. Maybe he's just gone back to his old self. I really hope so. I missed the old Dave. He was so different from most guys. RAR, guys are pooey.   But, yeah, anyway, I didn't do much this past weekend. The only real thing I did was hang out with Chris, jim, and Alex. It was actually a lot of fun. Haha, Alex's mom fed us dinner. It was really good. Then we went to Chris's to watch Swimfan and the Matrix, which I hadn't seen. Wow, that's such an awesome movie. I usually don't like those types of movies, but I liked this one. It was so cool!   I have to go soon. We've got a gig at Ellsworth Elementary. It'll be fun. I wonder if we get to see the kids play. That'd be so cool. It'd do wonders for my self esteem.   Eeps, anyway, I'm outta here.   Actually, before that, I heard this really mean saying the other day that I thought was funny, but...argh, it was so mean. I feel terrible for laughing at it. They said, \"I'm outta here like the fat kid in dodgeball.\"  That's terrible, is it not? I still can't believe I laughed then, I feel so mean.  Anyway, I am out of here. I probably wont write again tonight considering the amount of homework I have.   Goodnight you princes and princesses! :)",
    "Well, I think I'm going to stop writing in here because I found a good site to write, where no one can see it, so...I'll actually write what I need to, and what I want to. I may start writing in here again at some point, but...'eh, I highly doubt it.",
    "It's weird. I hate eating in front of other people. I always feel so guilty. I don't know why. I eat so much at home. I should be like, half the size of mexico.",
    "Yeah, so...I spent the evening with Chris. It was fun. I think he thinks I'm really annoyed with him though, and I'm not at all. I'm jujst annoyed with most people right now, and I'm irritable. I can't wait for summer to come. I NEED summer. Hmmm. Oh well, haha, we went to chili's. It was interesting. I haven't been there in so long. I got this really big dessert. Haha, so good...but....too much. I think I'll go running tomorrow.   But, anyway...that's really all I want to say right now because I can't really type everything I need to in this journal.   Byebye.",
    "I beat the system. I'm supposed to be researching for a speech, and I couldn't get on here from the school computer at first, but I can now. YES! Ahahaha, I beat the system. I'm typing in here, and I'm not supposed to be during school. I'm a rebel!!!",
    "Well, since blogger is DUMB, my entry for today got deleted.   Stupid blogger.  Oh well, I really don't feel like typing it again so, I wont.  Maybe I'll write more later.  Bye.",
    "I'm not intelligent I'm not pretty I'm not funny I'm not a slut I don't like most people I'm not nice I'm too loud but too quiet I'm too untrusting I'm selfish  Please, if you think of anymore...let me know.",
    "Today, was good overall. Yes, very good.  :)  Turn the faucet off baby See we're floodin' the floor now What a shame  Drown the neighbors out baby Our little love tub's out the door No more rap, nor more dub The steam Is almost hidin' you away In our tub of love here I'll scrub all over you and you can scrub... All over me  Just move your leg a bit  And I'll move mine We'll get so clean Our love is lookin' fine  I'm shining now and so are you In our tub of love, life is new We're almost perfect now, me and you.  I really don't take those words in a sexual nature. They just make me think. Sure, they could be meant in a sexual way but, I didn't take them that way.  So, yeah. There's no one right now thankfully I think. I'm kind of glad I don't like anyone. I don't have to feel all awkward around people, and it's just so much more complicated when I do like someone.  I'm really avoiding my science lab. I wish I could have gone to Kohl's with Brandon. Oh well. I talked to Chris on the phone for a bit, and still avoided doing my lab.   I've been talking to Erica a lot the past few days. It's been nice. Anyway...must go actually do homework. :(  Poo.  Bye.",
    "OK, Chris isn't mad at me, but...I'm still sort of down. I don't know why. I truly don't. I'm sure there's some reason deep down inside and I just don't realize it, but...ARGH! It's super annoying.",
    "Dag nabbit. I think Chris is mad at me now because I'm an idiot and was short with him last night because I was in a bad mood. I wasn't mad at him, just...maf in general. Argh, oh well.",
    "Talked to Kathryn on the phone for a bit. I needed it. I'm glad she was home. :)  I think I'm going to call someone. I don't want to be alone tonight.",
    "I'm lonely. No one around to talk to, to hug, to just be with. Being with a big group of people wont help it. I'll still feel alone deep inside. It's hard to understand. I need just the right person to be with right now, and I don't even know who it is. I just, need to be with someone I can trust, someone I really care about. I  think I want to spend tonight with Joanne and Kathryn and Kelly and Mary Clare. I need people I can talk to, have real conversations with, cry around without feeling stupid. I need a shoulder, and yet...nothing is there. Just air.The air I need to live, the air I need to breathe, and yet...it's doing nothing for me right now. I'm still sad. People just distract me from it for a bit.",
    "I just took a shower. I love showers. They always make me feel so good.    Today is going to be a good day!! No matter what!",
    "You know....Diane really is an amazing person. She's terrific at cheering me up. So is Joanne. And that's all I've got to say about that.",
    "Well, I'm less angry now after having talked with a certain someone. Thanks a lot. You know who you are. I don't know. I think I just needed to talk to a specific type of person tonight. I'm glad I'm not so angry anymore though. I don't even know why. I don't get it. I mean, I was super angry, and just so dissapointed with the world, and so annoyed. I'm sure this will all be better tomorrow though.  Goodnight",
    "??????? - (1:31:56 AM): hell your like the best person i know  One of those people is doing a darn good job of cheering me up. Thank you.",
    "The only people I'd even want to talk to right now are my mom, Ryan, and Alex.",
    "I don't get why I'm so angry/annoyed with some people and perfectly ok with others.",
    "Darnit. I am so angry and dissapointed, and sad right now. It's not cool.",
    "You know who the coolest person in the world is? Someone who's so special they deserve an award? Ryan. Ryan Dewitt. Thanks Ryan. I love you!",
    "Oh yeah, I found out Peter doesn't hate me like no other. I'm glad. I don't like thinking that people hate me. Not a good feeling.",
    "The last few days have been ok. Just kind of chillin. I'm sick though, and I've been feeling like crap all week, so, I finally stayed home because I had no huge obligations. Thank goodness. I'm starting to feel better just from getting some actual sleep.  I had marching, \"tryouts\" both Wednesday and Thursday Yesterday was basics. It wasn't nearly as hard as I thought it was going to be, thank goodness. I'm actually kind of glad I stuck with marching, and promised my mom I'd do it. We watched the senior movie with the song, \"We Go On,\" in it. It's a song from my Freshman year show. It always makes me so sad.  Anyway, scariest conversation ever last night. I was talking to Chris, and he's like, \"What if I just told you how I really felt about you?\"  I started flipping out, because I couldn't tell if he was serious or not, because I couldn't hear his voice, and I was like, \"Ah, he's already had a crappy week, how the heck am I supposed to say this nicely.\"  And, someone asked me later that night, when we were talking about people we like, \"Why don't you just go out with Chris?\"   I don't think people get that we're just good friends and nothing more. I don't think I could ever go out with Chris. Ever. It'd be way too weird, and...ick. Just...no. No offense to him of course. I mean, he feels the same way, so....people, just...forget it. Chris and I don't like each other, and never will. Well, like as more than friends. I'm just sick of it.  I wish people could realize that just because I have guy friends, doesn't mean I like them, or want to go out with them. I had a conversation with Bryan about it. It's actually really easy to talk to Bryan. I'm glad he's my friend. And no, I don't like Bryan as more than a friend.  Enough said. You get my point. Byebye.",
    "I was reading a past entry of mine, and I said how I could never forgive him for what he did to her. I don't think it's my place to forgive in the first place. It's her's. I certainly don't think what he did is right, nor do I condone it, and certainly I would kick his scrawny butt if he ever did anything to hurt her again, but it's still not my place to forgive.  I doubt anyone's going to understand this entry at all, but I needed to write it for my own personal well-being.",
    "I put that conversation with Katharine in here because it makes me happy. It jut made me feel really special, and it will be good for me to look at when I feel sad. Who knows if she really meant it though? Maybe she does that with everyone. Oh well. I really don't know.  My head hurts, and my nose hurts, and my eyes hurt from rubbing them.  I just hurt!  Dumb colds. My mom gave me her cold she had for the past weekend, and I have an eye doctor appointment tomorrow. Those aren't good to have when your eyes are watering alll over the place! :(  Oh well, not much to say about today. It was pretty boring. I'm doing marching band down I think. Brandon got section leader, but...so did Peter. It's confusing. Brandon got section leader for marching, and Peter got it for music or something. It's all very confusing.I guess Brandon's highter in the chain of command though, which is good because Peter hates me like no other.  Ah, too much to do at once.  Nothing more iinteresting to say anyway.  Byebye! :)  Overall mood for the day: Happy",

It just...kind of hurts sometimes to have no one like you. No one care for you.   Everyone teases me. EVERYONE. I get kind of sick of it sometimes. I like it sometimes, because it is a lot of attention, but then there's those times when it really truly hurts. I hate when people make fun of me because I can't see well. You want to make fun of me for it? Then fix it! I know I can't see well. It wasn't exactly my choice, so...back OFF! Argh. Even when I tell people not to. They stop for a bit, then go right back to it. Tell me, why is it so easy to pick on me? Why? What is it about me that makes it so incredibly easy? I mean, I'm certainly not miss America, but I'm a pretty good person for the most part. I try to be nice, and honest, and have good morals, and people just keep shooting me down. Why try to be a good person when all people do is shoot you down? What's the point? I'll tell you something. There is none. I like being me, but it's hard sometimes to do the right thing when everyone still makes fun of you. I don't see people who do wrong things get shot down. It's cool now to go get drunk on a Friday night. It's cool to have STD's because you've had sex with however many people. It's cool to be mean, and heartless. Well, heh, cool people suck I guess.  I'm really just sick of it all. I respect very few people at my school. I can't wait for summer to come to be through with it. Then, the next year, I can go back and do it all over again. Dislike people all over again. Be upset over how people do wrong things CONSTANTLY all over again.   I want to stay in Michigan. I want to be away from it all. I want to not see almost everyone here. I know I wont respect the people there anymore, but, it'll take longer because I don't know them. I don't know that some of them actually have the potential to be good people. I don't know that some of them just do it to be popular.  For what? For four years of true misery? For four years of hating yourself but loving the attention? For four years of wasting your time on people you probably wont see again?  Some four years.",
    "Today's been kind of a bummer. I'm in a bummed out mood, and I really want to see him. I know I shouldn't like him, and maybe I don't really, but...man, it feels like I do. I'd like to do something with him outside of school. I think he'd be pretty fun to hang out with. Oh well. Tonight I'm going to see Bruce Almighty with Kathryn hopefully. It'll be a fun time. YaY! Everyone seems so busy, and my weekend seems SO boring. I'm not sure why, but...'eh. What I want is to see someone I can't, and that doesn't hwlp things.   Yesterday was a good day. School was pretty boring as usual, and then last night I went to One Acts with Kelly, Kathryn, and Joanne. It was really funny, and Mary Clare tugged her ear FIVE times to say hello to us up on stage. :) It was neato. During intermission we went down where a bunch of band people were, and there must have been somethin in the air, because we were all acting CRAZY! Wooo! Anyway, it was fun and...yeah, now I'm off to go to the movies with Kathryn! Woo hoo.  Byebye.",
    "I'm not sure what kind of mood I'm in. She said it was no big deal, but...I still think she's mad at me. She said not to worry about her, and...I guess I'll try. I just care about her, and never ever want to say anything that would make her upset. :( I need to think.",
    "Wow, so, yes. Yesterday was fun. i went the whole school day without talking. It was interesting. I get $20 though. YaY! But, yeah, I couldn't write down that I was in a bet with someone, or speak obviously, so...I had to get one person to guess. Luckily after that one person guessed it was easier, because I got him to tell some people, etc. It was fun. So, then I went home, couldn't find my dress for the concert and freaked out. Haha. I found it eventually, but...still. Um, I went to the concert, and it was fun. We didn't suck horribly shockingly. I was amazed. Concert band was ok. Kristen and I sat there and found six good things about them. 1.) Red bow ties, 2.) Recognizeable melody, 3.) Good beat, 4.) When they stood up, they made this arch type thing, tallest in the middle, and shortest going out, 5.) Mr. S! 6.)Hmmm, I do not remember. Oh well. We did come up with six.   So, it was fun overall, but, I was glad to get home and sleep. It was exciting. I actually slept the whole night without waking up once. I was so tired I guess.   Today was ok. Just a pretty normal day until marching. Well, actually...marching was pretty normal too, but...yeah. We just did washington post, like we do every parade, and then went outside and marched for a bit. Fun stuff, 'eh? Hmmm. Brandon drove me home, and here I am. Heh.  I feel terrible though. I have this joke with my friend. She's incredibly skinny, and it's this joke about her being fat, and complaining about it and whatnot, but...I didn't think before I put this joking away message on that said how I don't like when people who are skinny think they're fat, but...I really didn't think before I spoke, or...wrote I guess. So, of course someone who I really hadn't intended to hurt, or even direct that toward saw it, and...I think she got upset. I was looking at her away message, and she seemed kind of upset, so...I looked at her diary thing, and I saw. I just, feel so terrible I tried calling her but she's eating dinner. I really need to talk to her and straighten this out, because it wasn't ablout her. Argh. I REALLY need to be more careful of what I say. Heh, this gives me a good example for my speech on how people need to think before they say things though.    Yes, she got online. Phew!",
    "Well, I had a pretty busy day. Lots to write about, but I'm just so exhausted I can't right now. I Will write about it tomorrow. Wow, lots of, \"writes\" and, \"rights\" Wheee. Yeah ok, I'm too tired. Byebye.",
    "You know. Heh, kind of funny what this all makes me think. He's actually never ever had the right to do that. He's never earned it. He's had so much time, and nope, it's more important. It'd probably take him twice the time he's known me to earn the right.  I do realize no one has any idea what I'm talking about. I guess it's a good thing.",
    "Argh!!!!!! Get AWAY from me you jerk! Get away, get away, get away. I don't like you now. I don't want to speak to you right now. I don't want to speak to you for a VERY loooong time. I know I will in a few days, but for now, STAY THE HECK AWAY FROM ME! I'm not gong to say I hate you because I'll probably regret it later, but...I certainly feel like saying that. YUCK! GET AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!! I seriously just need to get that out. It's not all out yet. I'm still extremely mad, and extremely annoyed, and EXTREMELY upset.   Who are you to tell me that when you can't even control your OWN life? Who are you to tell me that when you are in absolutely no condition to? Who are you? Huh? I'll tell you who you are. A huge jerk. Yeah, you tell me this when you have the right to, and I'll listen. Tell me now, I'll come close to hurting you. BACK OFF!!!",
    "Well, today was an ok day.  Band was normal, except for being in the auditorium, which stinks because it's so warm under the lights in there. Music Theory, thank god he didn't talk. I couldn't have handled it today. Chem, we did a lab, blah blah blah, nothing interesting. Health, we went over the female reproductive system and whatnot. This girl Kat in my class is fearless. She asks questions noone would even THINK about asking. And she shared some...umm, interesting facts about herself that I didn't need to know. Let's just put it this way. before she left she said, \"Well, now that you all know my menstruel cycle.\" Eeks.  Speech was boring. We took a quiz dealy thing and such. I have to change my topic for persuasive because I can't get enough sources. Heh, my speech is Friday too. :(  Lunch was normal. Math we took a reallly hard quiz, and gov. was fun as always. Right before government though, like, in the hall on the way, I got into one of my quiet modes. I'm not unhappy or sad, or even angry, I just feel like being quiet. Everyone gets all scared when I go into my quiet mode though and always ask what's wrong twenty thousand times. Oh well.  I'm going to go make my dinner now, so...yes. Goodbye.",
    "Oooo, someone bet me that I couldn't be quiet for a whole day of school. I'm definitely taking the challenge. Definitely. Ahahahaha. It will be most excellent. Seriously. The only trouble with be explaining this to people.",
    "I feel like being quiet. It's always so funny when I feel like being quiet. People always ask me, \"What's wrong?\" \"Are you ok?\" Catie! What happened?\" Nothing. I'm perfectly fine, perfectly happy, and...perfectly quiet. It's ok to be quiet isn't it? People act like it's a sin. Dag nabbit, just let me be quiet. Hehe. Anywho, I'm off to go eat dinner/do something constructive...maybe?",
    "I'm going to smile like nothing's wrong, talk like everything's perfect, act like it's just a dream, and pretend its not hurting me...because one day it won't and everything will be ok.",
    "We come to love not by finding a perfect person, but by learning to see an imperfect person perfectly.",
    "Talking to Christy right now. It's actually really awesome. I miss her. I can trust her so much it's unbelievable. She's probably the single most trustworthy person to ever be in my life other than my mom.",
    "So, yeah, I didn't end up doing anything. Oh well, I guess it happens. I guess I just didn't want to spend my Saturday night alone. Argh. I wish I could drive. That would be really nice. Being able to drive would be a total escape for me. I could go places by myself and not bring anyone else, or have to get a ride from anyone else. It would be so super nice. *Sigh* I just want summer to come. I want to go to Michigan. I want to feel the sand beneath my feet, and the cool waves splash against my legs. :I want to walk alone along the beach at sunset. I just want to be by myself in a beautiful place. I think I'm going to go read now...  Bye...",
    "Haha, I changed it again. Wow, this is fun. Wheeee. OK, I think I'm definitely having WAY too much fun.",
    "I got a new template. It's an ok template, but I love the name of it. \"Aliens Stole My Wallet.\" Haha, I guess I'm easily amused.",
    "Life seems pretty good right now. I have a lot of homework, but other than that, life seems good. I think I'm going out later. YaY! I'm not spending my Saturday night alone.",
    "So, I went to Michaels to get my shirt for Chemistry and the whole Ty-Dyeing thng. I wanted to get a long sleeved one, but I couldn't find one. :( Oh well, such is life. I wonder what I'll do tonight...",
    "Diane-Orange Derek-Red Kelly-Red Matthew-Orange Kristen-Orange Joanne-Yellow Mary Clare-Sky blue Brett-Blue Emily-Yellow Dave-Sepia Bryan-Bright yellow Chris-Orange Brandon-Green Me-Brown  I wanted to remember what color everyone has said so far, so I'm writing them down.",
    "Haha. Wow, I was SUCH a loser as a child. It amazes me. I'm still a loser, but man....  Alphabetizing crayons. Wow. Psh.",
    "I'm glad I'm secure enough with myself to be able to stay at home on a Friday night without feeling bad.",
    "OK, so, I've come to the conclusion that if I were a crayon, I'd be brown. I feel bad for the brown crayon. Nobody likes the brown crayon except a few. No one really respects the brown crayon. They all need it at one point or another though, to draw a tree or brown hair, and they don't realize how useful the brown crayon is. Really, how many times have you really thought how much the brown crayon is used? And yet, no one likes it. The brown crayon will probably explode someday from so many rejections, and it will be terrible. All the little kids always go for the pretty colors. Blue, purple, pink, but it's not the appearence of the crayon so much. It's how useful it is. What it does. The brown crayon is helpful, and is always there even though all the kids reject it.   I get philisophical when I'm tired....or just very weird. :)",
    "Things have actually been going ok this week. The week is going by really fast thankfully, but I know next week will drag by SO MUCH! I don't really feel like typing anything right now, so...maybe I'll write more later. I have to go make my dinner anyway.",
    "I miss Victoria. I miss how she would always come when I called her. I miss how she'd do anything for me. I miss how she would sleep with me every night. I miss how she would only come for me, and how she only liked me. I miss how everyone would say, \"Catie, go get Victoria, you're the only one who can get her.\" I miss how she ALWAYS sensed when I was sad, from anywhere in the house and would come find me to cheer me up. I miss my cat. MY cat. She was truly mine, and she loved me. She loved me for what I am. She didn't want to change me. She didn't want to make me any different at all. She loved me for being me.   I don't miss that I found her lying on the floor dead. What a horrible way to lose something you love SO much. I really miss her. She'd be hear listening to me, crying with me, cuddling with me. I can't believe I'm letting myself think about it again. After I found her lying there, motionless, I wouldn't let myself think of it. I couldn't. :( Why am I doing this to myself? Crying wont make her come back. The one thing that truly loved me and was completely devoted to me.  Feels like I just fell face forward and a piece of that glass was wedged into my heart.",
    "I would love people to just answer this question honestly. What's wrong with me? Why can't I seem to get anyone to like me other than Matt? Really? I don't understand. I really don't. I think I'm a pretty decent person, but maybe I'm just fooling myself. Maybe I've been fooling myself all the time. I'm never going to find someone. Never. There's not even one person who's remotely interested in me. Everyone seems to find someone, and I get to hear all about it, and...heh. Wow. I love that people trust me, and tell me stuff but...I guess, it just hurts when I realize that no one's talking about me to someone. No one likes me, has ever liked me, or will ever like me.   Right now, the glass is not just half empty, it's empty and shattered.",
    "So, what to do, what to do. I don't know. I don't even know what I'm thinking. Life seems very confusing right now. Michigan. Michigan. Michgan. I just need to keep thinking of it, and I'll be happy. :)",
    "Haha. OK, so Angie and I made up a good analogy.  Abstinence is like Thanksgiving dinner. You don't eat anything all day because you know dinner will be really really good.  YaY for abstinence!",
    "My head says no but my heart says yes. I can't follow my heart though. It will end in pain and humiliation. I know it will.",
    "Even if I did like him, there's nothing I would ever do about it. Why am I such a chicken?",
    "They say this is the best time of your life, and I don't necessarily doubt it but there's some pretty crappy stuff that goes along with it.",
    "OK, so, I'm super tired, and super anxious to get back to reading my good book right now so, I'm remindng myself to write about this stuff later.  -My day -Cleaning out my locker/after school adventure -Tyler -Going to Finding Nemo -Kathryn's little outburst at the boys in the car  :)",
    "I still can't even fathom what he did to his first girlfriend.",
    "I'm actually surprised at how angry I am. I mean, I am....extremely angry. Angrier than words can express. Wasn't it enough to do that to one person? Now you want to ruin someone else?  Heh, another problem. I can't be around her if she's with him. I wouldn't be able to stand it. I'd want to kill something or someone.",
    "AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Darnit, thanks for ruining everything you jerk. Thanks a lot.",
    "I must say, it really makes me sick. Really really really. And she's being dragged into it. I think she's caving in and there's not a gosh darn thing I can do about it. Even if I were to tell her what a slime he is, and what he did to his old girlfriend, she wouldn't listen. She thrives on going against what people tell her. She would just probably go out with him faster or something. ARGH! Seriously, this all makes me sick. Incredibly sick.  He's going to hurt her like he hurt his last girlfriend. Man, that kids probably going to be an abusive husband someday, but the problem is, he seems ok normally, but he's so impulsive, and argh. Abusive relationship. He's going to hurt her. I can see it now, but she wants someone so much that she'll go for him. AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH. This is so bad, and it really really truly bothers me.   On a happier note, I talked to Joanne on the phone for a long time tonight. It was so nice. Ah, I love her! But, I just can't get this other thing out of my head. He's going to hurt her, and not just emotionally, but probably physically too. He's going to ruin her, crush her, strip her of her dignity. And in the end, I know I'll be right, but it wont feel good to say, \"I told you so.\" Whenever I'm so rarely right, it's bad if in the end it wont feel good to say that. Sure everyone deserves second chances, but he had so many with her. SO many. Argh.   I need to sleep.....",
    "Haha, I just realized I wrote \"my kelly's\" like they're mine! haha! Alllll mine!",
    "OK, I've decided. I'm not letting myself lose touch with my really good friends like my kelly's and Joanne and Kathryn, and Emily and stuff. No way no how. I'm just not going to let it happen. I'm determined! HMPH!",
    "OK, so, I've had a vision!!! I see the light! Ahhh!  OK, so when Kelly becomes rich and famous, and I go to one of her concerts, and then try to get backstage, the guards will yell at me and be like, \"GET AWAY YOU WHITE HAIRED NUTCASE!\" And I'll be like, \"But I know her!!!\" And they'll laugh in my face, and then Kelly will come up and say, \"Catie my love,\" and I'll laugh REALLY HARD into the guards faces. Ahahahahaha. It shall be fun.",
    "As pathetic as this song is musically, I still love it...  So we talked all night about the rest of our lives Where we're gonna be when we turn 25 I keep thinking times will never change Keep on thinking things will always be the same  When we leave this year we wont be comin' back No more hangin' out 'cause we're on a different track And if you got somethin' that you need to say You better say it right now 'cause you don't have another day  'Cause we're movin' on and we can't slow down These memories are playin' like a film without sound And I keep thinkin' of the night in June I didn't know much of love but it came too soon  And there was me and you And then we got real blue Stayed at home talkin' on the telephone We'd get so excited and we'd get so scared Laughing at ourselves thinkin' life's not fair  And this is how it feels As we go on We remember All the times  We had together And as our lives change Come whatever  We will still be friends forever  So if we get the big jobs and we make the big money When we look back now will our jokes still be funny Will we still remember everything we learned in school Still be tryin to break every single rule  Will little brainy bobby be the stock broker man Can anna find a job that wont interfere with her tan I keep, keep thinkin that it's not goodbye Keep on thinkin it's a time to fly  And this how it feels As we go on We remember All the times We had togetther And as our lives change Come whatever We will still be friends forever  Will we think about tomorrow like we think about now Can we survive it our there Can we make it somehow I guess the thought that this would never end And suddenly it's like we're women and men Will the past be a shadow that will follow us round Will these memeories fade when I leave this town I keep thinkin that it's not goodbye I keep on thinkin it's a time to fly  As we go on We remember All the times  We had together And as our lives change come whatever We will still be Friends forever",
    "Yeah, so, Im kind of sad. It was the seniors last day today, and I don't even really know any seniors, but it just makes me think how much closer I'm coming to being a senior and leaving and having to go off on my own, and not seeing my friends anymore. Then, of course, it reminds me of next year where not only do I lose my best friend, but other very close friends. I'll luckily still have awesome friends senior year, but...I'm still going to miss my friends leaving after next year. I think I'm most worried about Chris. I can talk to him so easily, and spend time with him alone without any pressure, and....I feel so comfortable around him. I'm worried that after he goes to college, I wont ever see him, nonetheless talk to him. This is why I truely despise getting a specific best friend. They leave at some point, or you grow apart, or something. It's the same thing that happened with Christy and Amanda, and....well, Kelly will always be my friend. No matter where we are. She is the one person I am positive I will keep in contact with after High School. I have complete faith in that. I've known her for so long, and she's just Kelly. I know we'll talk at least periodically to each other throughout the rest of our lives. I know I'll go to her wedding, and well, hopefully not her funeral. Everyone else, I'm not so sure. I hardly talk to Christy anymore, and Amanda, the only reason I really talk to her is because my mom's best friends with her mom. I still do love them, and would still take a bullet for each of them, but...I just don't talk to them as much. Then my other really close friends...Kelly C., I think our lives will go in completely different directions, and we'll grow apart. I'll be there for her when she becomes a famous clarinet player in the CSO, but I have a feeling after High School, we wont talk as much. Kathryn, I don't really know what will happen. I think we'll try to keep in contact, but just end up growing apart. Like, the calls will somehow end up being few and far between. Emily, oh...I don't know. If she actually does go to Europe, that's the end. Keeping in touch with someone on another continent is really difficult. I hope for her sake she does get to go though. Joanne's already going off to England, and who knows what will happen with that. And....just, wow. I need to stop thinking about this, and my other close friends. I haven't even really talked about any of my guy friends. I'm stopping myself now.  I hate this. I've had such a great blessed life. It's just hard for me to accept change at all.   Tell me that we belong together....  And I'll be your crying shoulder...  Drat. I've managed to truely bum myself out.   :( Things just seem so sad right now.",
    "What scares me most, is that I wouldn't be surprised if that happened....  Haha, I love talking when no one has any idea what I'm saying.",
    "I miss my cat. No, no, no, no, no, not now. I'm not thinking of her now. Nope, I'll start to cry. I've managed to push it to the back of my mind and force it to stay there, and that's what I'm going to keep doing.",
    "What do you do when the only person who likes you is the only person you truely dislike?  He's the only person I'll ever get to like me, and I can't even like him one bit. JEEZ! Figures.",

    "I've been writing more and more in here lately. I wonder why. *Sigh* I don't know what's up with me. I mean, I'm happy...but, I'm sad at the same time. I feel like I'm missing something.

    "I was looking at some of my very fisrt blog entries. Wow, I've really changed a lot. It sort of amazes me. Anyway, I found this somewhere in there, and I want to re-post it so that I keep remembering it.   Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking. It is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil, but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails. -1 Corinthians 13:4-8  :) I love it. I love the Bible. I love God!!! Sometimes, I think people think I'm some heathen atheistic person, and I'm completely not. It's completely the other way around. I just like to worship God in my own way, and my own way is a quiet way. I don't like to push my views on other people. People who try to push their views on others really bother me. I love God, and have complete faith in him. That's all I need to know. If other people don't believe that, nothing I say will change their minds. That's why I don't understand why so many wars are faught over God. Don't you realize you're doing what God doesn't want you to do?? You're killing, and  argh. Has this war over God ever been resolved?? No, because not everyone worships God in the same way or worships him at all. It bothers me so much. Let people believe what they want to believe.   Wow, ok...sorry, venting.",

    "AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!! I am SO stressed right now. So so so very stressed. I'm so sick of him. So sick of him. He does everything he possibly can to annoy me. It's like he trys to. It's like he wakes up in the morning and thinks of ways to make me mad.   I just went online and realized that there's no way I can have a conversation with anyone right now. It's stupid to even consider trying, it really is. I'm just going to say something I don't mean or something. Argh. I feel so low and terrble and...lonely. I know I have awesome friends, but I guess I just feel lonely right now. I guess it's normal. Everyone's allowed to feel lonely. Heh, I feel lonely, yet at the same time, I want to be left alone. I don't want to see anyone at school tomorrow. Maybe a few people, but not most. I want people to just leave me alone at school tomorrow. Not talk to me, not nag me, poke me, tease me. None of that. I want to see only a few people like my lunch gang, and them.   I wish I could see Amanda. Man, I miss her so much. I wish she hadn't moved to Texas. :( I wish I could see Heather too. If she's changed some of her ways, I want to see her a lot this summer. Argh. Is today over yet? Is tomorrow over yet? Heh, I'm not exactly following my quote, \"never let the sunset on tomorrow before the sun rises today.\"  I had a really strange dream the other night. I'm not sure if it was good or not. It was with someone I'm really close to. I don't know. It was weird. I guess i'm still analyzing it. Who knows? I just need to do this speech crap so that I can go read and sleep.

    "Yes! Finally! This wasn't working before for some odd reason, and it was making me mad. Man, I feel so sick. My tummy really really hurts. :( Stupud guys. Seriously, they NEVER have to deal with anything. Grrr.   So, today was an ok day. Only 4 more days of actual class. Wind Ensemble, I went to the writing center and actually worked on my speech outline. I was amazed, I actually did work. Then, music theory, gosh, I want to get away from that class SO SO SO much. Seriously. Yuck. Oh well. He just talked, and talked, and talked, and blah bah blah!!!!! Argh. It seriously didn't end. Chemistry was ok. We just got a ton of really confusing notes. Argh. Poo on Mr. K. Sometimes he's ok, but sometimes I just want to choke him. RAR! Ummm, Health was ok. Really boring and pointless. Busy work. Grr. We wrote stories with 15-25 words we found in the chapter. It was really very pointless. Speech was ok. I didn't have to give my speech. Someone else gave a speech on Plastic Surgery though so...yikes. Oh well. Umm, lunch was ok. Math was boring. I think I actually understood what we were doing though. Government, we just watched 12 Angry Men.  It was really a pretty boring day, and I think I'll go work on my speech now so I can go eat dinner and go read, and then go to sleep early. Wow, that would be nice. OK, Byebye.",
    "Goodmorning. I really hope today goes well and that I don't have to give my speech and that Mr. A isn't there. You kinow, something just occurred to me...if Alstadt were to ever by some chance read this, A.) I'd never have a chance of making WE again or B.)I'd feel terrible or actually...both! Yikes. Maybe I need to stop writing about Alstadt in here. I know I wont because he makes me mad a lot, but...maybe I can try to talk about him less. Anyway, I'm off to school. YaY? Byebye!",
    "OH MY GOSH OH MY GOSH OH MY GOSH! BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD IMAGES!!!  Ewwwww!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   I think I'm going to be ill...",
    "I'm really worried. I haven't talked to Alex lately. I don't want to lose him as a friend. He's such an awesome person. I don't ever want to stop talking to him.",
    "Haha, you know what phrase I've always liked? \"Shifty character.\" Haha, so funny. :)",
    "Hey, I finished my music theory composition! YES!!!! I finished one thing on my list! How awesome is that??? I never called *boy* I swear I was going to, but I couldn't work up the courage. OK, so, I wasn't going to. I can't do it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I talked to a cool kid on the phone anyway, so...it was overall an ok Sunday evening.",
    "Hmmm, you know, it's kind of funny. I never realized how little I mention my dad. I was talking to someone on the phone tonight, and they asked me where my dad was, like as if he were gone or something. Kind of funny. My dad's a cool guy. I really get along with him. I just get along with my family in general. they're cool. I mean, I don't talk to my dad about personal stuff like I do with my mom, but...I still talk to him. Anyway, I think I should go quickly get some research for my final speech and whatnot, then I'm off to bed, so tired! Byebye....",
    "Things to do:  -Finish music theory composition -Finish...or, start my final speech and do the outline for it -Go outside and play basketball for a little bit -Have a cookie...with milk. -Call *Boy* :) (Like this one will EVER happen) -Get over the fact that it's NOT SUMMER YET! -Buy new earings -Stop writing in blog to avoid homework and doing most of these things!!  I'll add more as I think of more later.   Man, thinking about everything though....life is really good.",
    "AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I loathe homework with the deep burning passion of a thousand fiery suns!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",
    "Man, I am SO avoiding homework. Grrrr. I don't want to do it soooo very much. I'm finishing my music theory thing and it bites. I loathe music theory with a burning passion. I shouldn't have taken it. I don't fit in. I suck at writing music, and I suck at music in general. Grrrr. Oh well. My patience is wearing thin with someone right now. It's getting harder and harder for me not to get angry with him for even little things. He's aggravating me so much, and he just...really knows how to make me mad. It's almost like he works on it or something. Oh well, I'm out of here like the fat kid in dodgeball. Poor fat kid. :(",
    "Yep, I've decided. Definitely. Funny how spending just an hour and a half with your girl friends can make things seem so SO clear. So, that is what I did this evening. I went to Kathryn's house. We just hung out and whatnot. It was a lot of fun. I love being with them. Kelly wasn't there, but oh well. Things were fun just the same. Then after that, I got to drive! YaY! It was fun. Anyway, I'm kind of tired, so...I'm going to bed now, I think, hopefully, if no one IM's me. If someone IM's me...it's all over. I'm so addicted to AIM. Oh well, such is life.",
    "OK, I can stop pretending to clean. Man, why am I so scared of bugs? I saw this little ant, it wasn't hurting anyone, but it was coming close to me and I started FLIPPING out. I grabbed some Fantastik, and sprayed the little thing to death. Well, now I feel incredibly bad, but bugs scare me SO SO SOO much. Anything with ore than 4 legs scares me. It's just not natural to have more than 4. Like...centipedes. *Shiver* I don't even want to think about this actually.   So, anyway, I think I'm going to Kathryn's tonight, yay! So, I should probably go eat dinner and get ready for that and whatnot.   :)  I'm quite content right now.",
    "I don't know why I'm so excited to go to Michigan, but I am. I can't wait. I was talking with Lauren last night, and we were talking about partying and stuff, and I really want to. I mean...REALLY want to. I just want to have some fun and let loose, but I promised myself I'd never drink and stuff. Stupid promises. I don't even know why I do, I just really want to have fun. I'm sure I can have fun without drinking anyway. Sometimes, I guess I just want to be included in it all. I wanted to go with Pat and his friends and my brother when they all invited me a few months ago. It would have been awesome, hanging out with older people, but I didn't because I knew they'd drink and get high and stuff. I know they'll all be doing it, but at least Conor doesn't drink, so maybe I'll hang out with him when they're all drinking and stuff. I asked Max if he could bring up some non-drinking/single/non-attracting Sara guy. Heh, he said that wasn't possible with the Sara part. Heh. Anyway, haha, I thought part of my conversation with Lauren was quite amusing so I'm puting it in here.   Lokiluna13 (11:24:21 PM): hey, I'm a ruel breaker all the way Lokiluna13 (11:24:29 PM): I do drugs all the time and drink baby bear 321 (11:25:37 PM): hahahaha baby bear 321 (11:25:44 PM): can i quote that? Lokiluna13 (11:25:56 PM): lol baby bear 321 (11:26:00 PM): thats soooo goin in my profile Lokiluna13 (11:26:08 PM): I do!! Lokiluna13 (11:26:12 PM): haha baby bear 321 (11:26:35 PM): lemme guess baby bear 321 (11:26:43 PM): u drink pop and u take advil?? Lokiluna13 (11:26:58 PM): yeah...but....both at once, and I'm telling you, you're NOT supposed to do that. Lokiluna13 (11:27:02 PM): It's dangerous!  Haha, it just makes me laugh, but anyway, we've got plans. Big plans. We're going to get the guys back this year. We just have to think of some really really good prank to use. Ahahaha. We will. We're also going to go pick up some yokels. It will be VERY amusing.   Eek, must go. Have to pretend I'm cleaning. I'll probably write more later.",
    "I told Chris there was one thing I was positive about with Ryan last night, but...I'm not so sure anymore....",
    "It's like a game with us. A neverending game and I'm so sick of it. Three years of games.",
    "I am so in love I am so in hate I just can't comprehend it, uh You get me so high You get me so low I can't show what I'm feelin' Never was the type To let someone like You get under my skin, no Tried like hell but you Didn't care for real You stepped on my feelings  See I love to love you boy And I love to hate you But I got to let you know I'ma have to let you go See I love to love you boy And I love to hate you But I got to let you know I'ma have to let you go  Love to feel the love Love to heal from pain Is there really a difference? Wonder who is right Wonder who is wrong I'm just feeling some tension, uh You can't compromise We can't coincide We should really be chillin' 'Cause I've wasted so much time Love is on the line I've made my decision Yeah  It's useless to try and work things out Don't need all of the stress You're not worth it I'm tired of all the ups and downs So goodbye, I'm leaving Made up my mind  See I love to love you boy And I love to hate you But I got to let you know I'ma have to let you go See I love to love you boy And I love to hate you But I got to let you know I'ma have to let you go  It's useless to try and work things out Don't need all of the stress You're not worth it I'm tired of all the ups and downs So goodbye, I'm leaving Made up my mind  See I love to love you boy And I love to hate you But I got to let you know I'ma have to let you go See I love to love you boy And I love to hate you But I got to let you know I'ma have to let you go",
    "Well, I finished my letter to Ryan, now to give it to him? Do I? Don't I? I really don't know.",
    "Boys are stupid, don't throw rocks at them, throw huge giant shards of glass!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Haha...wow...I'm looooony. looony loony!!!",
    "Whooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!! I'm crazy, loony, psycho. I've definitely reached the highlands. Man, they say you need drugs and alcohol to get a buzz, I say just stay up extremely late! WHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!  Hahahahahahaha. Goodnight, goodnight!",
    "I don't know anything at all and I'm somebody else It could take years to find you, it could years to find myself And I don't need to hear your answer I just need you to see That I think it's time to break down these walls that we throw  Am I still breathing have I lost that feeling Am I made of glass 'cause you see right through me I don't know who I am and you're the only one who sees that I can't ask these questions that cannot be answered today And even if everything goes wrong and we start to fall apart I will understand where you are, I will understand this by myself And I don't need to hear your answer I just need you to feel Like there are no boundaries at all  And how far have we come, too far to throw away the past Will you be there waiting for me I have to ask what we are, if I ask today it just won't last So I'll be here waiting for you  Will we ever feel this good again - Not today  Will we ever feel this real again - Not today  Will you ever be mine again - Not today  Will we ever feel this real again - Not today     Stupid world. People suck.",
    "I had a very good very...interesting day. I don't think I want to write about it in here though. I was going to but I think I've decided against it.",
    "Haha. One more person I found out about who reads this thing. Eek. I really really need to be careful what I write. I guess it really doesn't matter since this is sort of my diary, and since I don't write anything in here that's too personal anyway   Luckily though, I CAN write about Ryan, because he never reads this.  I'm worried about tomorrow. At first I was supposed to go to Great America with him all day, but...I decided not to since there were tons of people I know going there, and I didn't want to see people I knew all day long. So, then we decided we'd do something else like bowling or a movie or something, but...I'm having second thoughts. I think if I do see him, I'll start liking him...again. I realllly don't want that, because a relationship with us just doesn't work. I obviously broke up with him for a reason last time. Why bother puting myself through that again? It just hurt me and him, and it took a while to get our friendship back. But, I guess I'm not really being a friend to him if I don't want to see him. I know if I do, I'll end up going out with him at the end of the day, and yeah...I've thought about doing that, but...it's partly because I just want to be in a relationship with someone. Hmmm, oh well. Tonight was fun. I went to Peter's party. It was excellent...well, I guess. It was alright, but I didn't know anyone, and Chris and Brandon went to play video games. Luckily, Kelly was there, and Annie too. I'm glad I'm friends with those two. Hmmm, so I left the party kind of early and just hung out with Chris for a bit. It was cool.   That's really about it. I guess I'm just really worried about this thing tomorrow. I felt like I was being a jerk to Chris. I was listening to him, just...not all there. Sigh. I guess what wants to happen will happen. I shall see, I shall see.",
    "YaY! OK, so, my day...  I slept in since I had my lunch final, and I went in late and went to take my government final. I'm glad I didn't bother studying for it. I got a 97% on it. That rocks so much. I wasn't sure whether or not to study, so, I didn't. Sweet. So, after that, Kelly, Joanne, John, Kathryn, Mary Clare, and I all went out to lunch. We went to THREE, count 'em, THREE! restaurants. The first two were just too full, so we ended up going to Einsteins. I wanted to get a peanut butter and jelly bagel, but I thought that I should wait til I was with Diane haha.  Sometimes I feel like Diane doesn't like me very much, like...I annoy her for some reason, or she doesn't trust me for some reason. I feel like I should say sorry to her, but I don't think I did anything. I'd love to be better friends with her, but I don't think she wants to. Oh well, I'm not giving up yet. Anyway...after we went to Einsteins, we went paddle boating. It was so fun. Haha. It was a little chilly, but still tons and tons of fun. Oh, I wouldn't suggest ever trying to switch with someone in the backseat, especially when you have four people in your boat. Good times, good times. Hmmm, then we went to Starbucks, but I don't like coffee, so I just got a fruit drink thing. Yum yum yum. Then Kathryn's mommy picked us up, and drove us to joanne's. we just hung out for a while. We did Karaoke, haha. We also played spoons, except...we used forks. Yikes. It's really dangerous. I cut myself. :( But, Joanne gave me an Elmo band aid so it's all good. The Elmo bandaid completely made my day.   I'm pretty sure we managed to make Kathryn mad. I think she's hiding it because she didn't want to ruin our good time, but I am pretty sure something we did got her mad. Oh well. Tonight, I'm going to Peter's party thing. I wasn't sure I wanted to go but so many people are going, so I figure I should give it a shot. Maybe I'll have a blast. Eek, I hope. So, Chris is driving me there in like an hour or so, or something. Heh. Fun day. Tomorrow will be good too. I'm probably hanging out with Ryan the entire day.  :)   Yes, tomorrow will DEFINITELY be good. We decided not to go to Great America since so many people I know are going.   Anyway, I think I'm off to do something...errr, constructive?  HAHA NOT! And why not? Because there's NO SCHOOL! WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!",
    "Today was so dull and boring I don't even really want to write about it. Heh. Oh well, tomorrow will be fun at least.",
    "My day was excellent, superb, wonderful! I was really dreading it. Honestly, this was maybe my easiest day, but I was still dreading it. Why? Because of meany pooface Alstadt. He's such a jerk sometimes. I'm sorry, but he is. Anyway, I just sat around before school IN THE BAND ROOM! I couldn't believe it was open. Heh, funny. It was open and guess who wasn't there? Anyway, I went to go take my speech final, and it was easy and all. I got a B on it without studying at all. It's ok. I'll still get an A in the class. I could have gotten a 68% on it.Excellent. Anyway...I did that, then went to band. Since we took the band final on Friday, there was nothing to do. I KNEW if I stayed Id' have to sort commencement music since we had to let it all dry out yesterday. So, Kelly and I decided to be rebels! WOO HOO! We walked to burger king and got some food. It was awesome. We got kids meals, and we got the toys that went along with them! It rocked! So, then we walked back, and no one seemed to notice. :) Excellent. Alstadt took attendance, but...no big deal. They aren't going to come after me with two days of school left. Also, my parents wouldn't care anyway. So, then, unfortunately, we had to go to music theory. It wasn't as bad as I thought. I proved Alstadt wrong though! YES! He said I couldn't go from A major to C major and have it sound good. HA! Not like my composition was good, but it still sounded ok, and Mr. A was wrong!!! WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!  Anyway, that was pretty much it today. Oh yeah, with our kids meals, Kelly and I got these scratch and sniff thing. Oh my gosh, there was one with a foot, and it smelled SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO bad. Wow! Terrible.   Anyway, I'm done. I think I'll go...I don't know, do someonething constructive?",
    "So, kind of a depressing day.  I woke up at about 10, couldn't find my shoes, searched alll over the house and finally found them. So, I go take my shower thinking, \"lalala, everything is good. I found my shoes.\" OK, maybe not. I find out my dress had a rip in it!! GRRR, so, I had to have my mommy fix that really fast, and I actually got there on time. We actually had to have commencement outside. Luckily we got to go in after we finished playing though. The poor seniors didn't. I really am surprised they didn't have the ceremony inside. Oh well. So, our music got ruined, my hair/dress/feet all got SOAKED! ahhh. Oh well. So, after that I unexpectedly got a ride home from Chris, changed into some dry clothes, and then we went to Chipotle and met Brandon and Bryan there. It was a lot of fun. I actually got something there. I've never actually had food there. It's so yummy. Mmmmm. I definitely couldn't finish it all though. So, yeah, then we went to Coldstone. I got chocolate ice cream with gummy bears. Yum. So very good. Then Chris and I just drove around and talked for a bit, and then, I came home, and I started to study for math, but I just couldn't do it, so...I decided to write. Haha. Lala. So, that was my exciting day.   It's kind of funny when someone who's your friend thinks if they tell you something they're thinking, you're going to hate them or something, and then they tell you, and you don't at all. It wasn't what you were expecting, because you were expecting to actually be mad at them but you aren't at all. And it just makes you love them more because they're so honest and truthful, and they trust you so much. I feel really trustworthy right now, and that's all I have to say. I'm sure no one has any clue what I'm talking about. Sorry. Oh well, I don't think anyone reads this anyway, do they? Oh well, no more talk of this ever.  I must be off to study. HA, like that'll happen.",
    "Argh. Tonight so many things are hurting me. I feel like my heart has been ripped apart so many times tonight. Like, it was ripped apart, and started healing, then ripped apart again. It hurts so much.",
    "So yeah...I just love being the one not paired up with anyone. Feels fantastic. Really.   I'm a big fat liar.",
    "There's no way I'm letting this bring me down dag nabbit.",
    "I don't know man.  Things just really seem to suck right now. I went out to Pizza Hut tonight with my friends but it just wasn't as fun as I was hoping for. I'm just in such a bad mood, it's hard to have fun. I feel like I'm compltely wasting my summer. I don't know how or why, but...I do. I just feel so mad right now, and sad...  Who knows? Maybe it'll be better tomorrow. :(",
    "Hm, ok....so, everyone left for Germany which kind of stinks but I've been doing tons of stuff!! It's amazing! I'm still writing to Chris and Kelly, and whatnot, but I've been hanging out with all my other friends here. I actually went to the pool yesterday in the middle of the day, and didn't get burned! Well, this one part of my face did because I must have missed it with my sunscreen, but still! I was so happy, and it was fun! Then I went to Kathryn's with Joanne and Kathryn, and we just hung out. It's kind of weird just being with both of them. Oh well. Then, last night I had a sleepover at Joanne's, and it was fun. I actually got a lot of sleep surprisingly. Heh, except it wasn't really good sleep, because sleeping on a florr REALLY hurts. Hmmm, we watched the Princess Bride! I'd never seen it before! It's really really good! YaY! It was fun! Oh, and haha, Joanne really can't take not knowing something. It was so funny. Kathryn said something that we couldn't tell Joanne, and Joanne REALLY wanted to know. It was just humorous. She usually knows everything, and the one thing she didn't drove her crazy. Woo, fun times.  So, today I've just been busy cleaning and whatnot, and tonight I'm going out with Katharine, and Diane, and Steve maybe, and Jeff maybe. It will be most exciting hopefully! :)  I must get going. I've got quite a bit to do actaully.",
    "I really don't think it's ever going to happen. :(",
    "So, my day was pretty ok. I gave my Daddy his gifts and stuff and that was fun, and other than that I really didn't do much. I played the computer game Civilization. Oh my goodness, that game is ADDICTING! Wow. So, anyway, everyone's leaving tomorrow. :( I'm going to miss everyone. A few of my really really good friends are going, and it'll be hard without them here. I doubt they'll miss me at all. Oh well.   Oh yeah! I cleaned my bathroom today too. Blah. I hate cleaning my bathroom. I hate cleaning altogether actually. I hope I'm rich when I get older so I can hire someone else to do that, or I'll try to marry someone who likes to clean. Ha. Like that'll happen. I mean the marrying part, not the finding someone who will clean part. :)   Anyway, talking to kelly. I'm going to miss her. Her and Chris the most. :( I'll write more later....maybe.",
    "You know, it's funny. I seem to like him less and less every day. OK, it's not funny. It's terrible, but really. He makes me so angry, and so mad almost every time I talk to him. Argh. Some people really annoy me.",
    "So, I was looking at my very first blog entry which isn't even on this page, and I just thought...\"wow Catie, you were SUCH a dork.\" Yeah, that entry actually scares me. I wonder if in 7 months I'll think the same thing I did of my Novemeber 14th first entry into one of these. I'm kind of surprised I've actually kept up writing in this. I've never actually kept a real diary. I've always felt like I was just whining to paper. I don't know how this is different, it's just whining to a computer screen, but still....I've kept up with it. I wonder how much longer I'll keep uo with it. I don't intend on stopping writing anytime soon. Hmmm....interesting thoughts. 'Eh, I'm not in much of a reflective mood right now, so I think I'll go read and wait for a good storm to come! :)",
    "Hm, ok, so that was odd. It just started raining a bit, and then it got sunny again, and now cloudy. Weird. I wonder if storms will be coming through all day. I actually like storms as long as they aren't too...errr....deadly...yes, that's it. I usually like to read during storms, like, snuggle up with my blanket and all my stuffed animals and just read and listen to the rain and thunder. It's fun, but...I guess I have a weird definition of fun.   I can't believe they're all coming home Monday. I'm pretty excited, but time here has also gone by extremely fast. I've gotten to hang out with a lot of people, and meet new people, and have a blast. 13 days til Michigan too. Plus, I found out that we're almost positively going to Italy for Thanksgiving this year. I'm SO excited. I love Italy. I really do. It's one of my favorite places in the world. :) And if my mom gets the bonus she might be getting for this thing she's working on...too hard to explain...then we get to fly first class. :) That would be so awesome. First class on an overseas flight. I could actually sleep. Not that coach is all that uncomfortable for a 5'0\" person like myself, but still, that's so awesome. I'm really excited, and I can't wait to go. I think though, that if the marching band goes to the Macy's Day thing, I'll miss it, which would not be cool...but still. I love Rome.   Hmmm, everything's too quiet in my house. I'm going to go check it out. It makes me nervous when my house is quiet.",
    "I was having a chat with someone this evening, and they asked me if I cried a lot. It was kind of funny...seeing as I almost never cry. Only when it's something really important to me, or when I just bottle everything up, or when I just listen to a gorgeous song, and emotions come. Most of the time, that's when I cry. Music makes me feel emotions I didn't even know I had. It's amazing. Although I don't want to go into it as a career, I am extremely glad it's part of my life, and I love people who can make great music. I truly truly respect it. Ah, anyway, I'm off to sleep...seriously...",
    "Haha, wow...I'm having so much trouble typing tonight. My fingers are being clumsy for some reason. I have to type like every word twice. Grrrr.",
    "Blah, blah, blah!! I'm not tired, and I actually, for once in my life, don't feel like reading. I don't know why I'm not tired at night. I woke up at a resonable hour today. Hmmm, I think I need to stop writing in here like a loser and go talk to my friends. I was talking to like...5 friends, and all the conversations ended at the same time. Poo. haha. Katharine just told me I should go sleep. Yes, yes I should. Will I? Probably not unfortunately. I should really take my friend's advice. They give good advice. On sleeping at least.  I heard Chris and Mike and both Daves were drinking in Germany. It kind of upsets me. Not upsets...but dissapoints. I'm surprised. I mean, I heard they didn't just drink but got drunk. I was especially surprised about one of the Daves. I have talked to him about drinking before, and I asked him if he ever drank, and he was like, \"NO!\" I remember that so well, because it almost seemed as though I'd offended him with the question at the time. Like, \"How could you ask me that? Of course I don't drink you silly girl.\" Ah well, I guess it's their choice, not mine. They can do what they want, but I guess I lost some respect for Dave.  So, I'm off to go talk to cool people because....err...because they're cool. Wheee. I think I'll go to sleep feeling happy. :) Plus, I finished my book, which is nice. I'll need to find a new one though. Ah...I'm off....",
    "Hmmm...I'm debating on whether or not to do this. Probably not. I'm a chicken. A dumb chicken with it's head cut off. I always thought that story about that chicken who lived for like...15 hours after he had his head cut off was interesting...I think it's terrible that someone cut the chicken's head off, but...I still thought it was kind of interesting. I wonder what science is behind that.",
    "You know, I just realized something. I always worried about how people probably think I'm weird because I go to the park and swing on the swings and listen to my music when I need to think. Well, I don't care. Everyone has a place that they think in, and that just happens to be mine. I don't even know why. It just relaxes me. It helps me filter my thoughts.

    "Sooo, today I'm just going out with my family and whatnot. It'll be a good time. It always is. I also have to clean my room if I want to get my new furniture. My mom's good at coming up with bribes. Grrr. Ah well. I'm off.",
    "Wow. I have a darn good life. An extremely extremely good life, and I'm just so happy about it. It kind of scares me sometimes too though, like...I'm too lucky. Like, eventually my luck will run out and terrible things will happen. Ah, who knows? I guess all I can do is be thankful for what I have now, and pray that it continues.  Hmmm, moving on to goofy mode. Wow, I'm such a loser. I get so weird at night. I should look into this. It's got to be something about the brain late at night. :)   Oh...and gummy bears taste delectible at 2:22 in the morning.",
    "OK, so I didn't sleep. So what? Haha. It doesn't matter anymore. I'm not going to Joanne's again tomorrow. Haha, oh well. We WILL watch it sometime. I'm determined now. We've set the date for July 9th now lol. It'll happen...sooner or later. Probably later, but it will still happen.  Hmmm, so, I'm talking to this kid right now. He seems really cool actually. And that's all I'm saying. Yes, that's definitely all I'm saying. Haha. So, I'm going to go finish talking to people and go read or something since I'm not particularily tired.",
    "Heh. OK, as of right now, I've decided on neither. Both are out. Hehe. Wow, that leaves me right where I started at. Dag nabbit. This is pooey, and so is my computer, it doesn't like me much. But what does? :) Tra la la, I had my grilled cheese earlier. It was yummy, and tonight I'm having chicken parmigan. Hmmm, I wonder how you spell parmigan...  Oh well. I think I'm going to I don't know...go be a loser someplace than on my blogger website.",
    "Hmmm, so, I was supposed to go to Joanne's, but she couldn't since she's got to do a lot of work on her mom's closet still. That's ok with me actually. I'm not feeling great anyway. It's just one of those, \"blah\" days. I think I'll probably go make myself some grilled cheese, and just, read my book or watch tv. YaY! Mmmm.....grilled cheese. I'm so addicted to that stuff. I really am. I think I need to get on a better sleeping schedule, but even if I do, I'll go off it again in MI. So, I guess there really isn't much of a point, because I refuse to go to bed at 9 every night when I go. Tra la la. I'm in a weird mood. Quite a weird mood. Hmmm, I just flung my pony tail thing across the room...Wow, I'm so weird. There's nothing really to type about. I still havem't decided, although I did find something out that could be helpful. Eh, I think I should just forget everything and wait til college. YaY college. Maybe there will be mature guys there. I hope....Joanne's lucky, but it's funny. I don't know how they are going to be apart a whole year next year. Joanne really misses him and it's only a week that he's gone now.I have faith in them though. I think they're going to be one of those high school couples that makes it, and actually stays together. They're like, made for each other. I'm really happy for both of them. :) Anyway, I think I'm going to go make my grilled cheese now, and read or something. Hmmm, I never sign this thing anymore. Oh well.",
    "I've figured something out. Guys don't like girls like me. They like mysterious girls, or funny girls, or interesting girls, or even girls that seem innocent. Hmmmm. I don't think I want to change myself, but....grrr. It still makes me angry. 16 days...only 16 days. It'll be nice to get away from Naperville. Very nice. I can't wait to go on the jetski's, and go tubing, and.....just lie in the hammock and read. :) So relaxing. *Sigh* ARGH! July 11th, WHY WONT YOU COME SOONER??? Oh well. Such is life. Hehe. Anyway, off to sleep. Nighty night.",
    "Well, at least this thing finally works. I guess I can write a little about my night, but not too much since I want to get some sleep since I'm going to Joanne's at 1:00 tomorrow. Tonight was ok. I was supposed to go out with Erica, Brett, and this kid Roger, but it didn't end up happeneing so I just went to Joanne's instead. Heh. It was alright. We just watched the first Harry Potter movie, and Kathryn kind of ruined part of the fifth book for me. Sadly, I think se did it purposely. Like...the way she said it, and when she did it, it felt like she knew exactly what she was saying. Kelly and I obviously weren't too happy. Oh well. It was still ok. Everything with Diane is all good now! :) I'm so happy it is, because I just...I don't know, things were awkward for a bit I guess.  Man, everyone seems so aggravated and irritated lately. It's weird. It's like everyone needs a vacation from each other. Like everyone needs to get away. I don't know, it's just odd. Man, I wish my mommy were home. I need to talk to her about this decision I'm trying to make. I don't know. I kind of wish I had someone who I could talk to about this, but...there are very few people I trust, and even them, it's not easy to talk about people I like with...  I guess we'll see what happens. I'm thinking of making a list of why I like both, and then deciding, but that just seems so...I don't know. I feel like I should know. I feel like I should feel in my heart which one's right. I guess....  Who knows?  I think I just need sleep. I was absolutely looony five minutes ago haha. I guess I've gotten into serious conversation with the person I'm talking to so I've gotten more serious, but I love when I can be goofy. I love just feeling silly and not caring what other people think. Woooo.   Anyway, I think I'm just going to go to sleep soon, maybe read a few pages of my book. Not Harry Potter. Ahh....byebye! :)",
    "Argh.....I wrote a whole thing and blogger was dumb, and didn't publish it.",
    "Hmmmm. Well, I just don't know now...I talk to one, and think I've decided but then talk to the other. Argh. I don't like making choices.",
    "I miss my cat. :( I really miss her. I wish she were here. She's be right by my side too. I could tell her stuff.",
    "So, I just went out with my mom and stuff today. It was fun. I found the furniture set I think I want, but it doesn't have the bed I want! Grrr!  I love it other than that, so...I'm thinking I'll probably get that set, and get an unfinished bed and paint it a fun color, or finish it in the color of the other furniture. Sooo, I'm going out again soon and I'm trying to decide whether I want to actually dress in something nice. I think I might just stick with my comfy pants. I love them. :) They make me happy.   Hmmm, It's only been 12 days since summer started...wow. It seems like a LOT longer. It hasn't even been two weeks. Yay though!! I'm looking forward to Michigan SO SO much!!!!!!!!!!!! AHHHH! I seriously can't wait. Not only am I going to get to see people I don't get to see often, but I'm going to read Harry Potter too :) YaY!!! Hmmm, this is being dumb so...it's not posting it. Oh well, I'm sure it will eventually. Blogger is weird....",
    "Wow, I really hope she forgives me. I did have fun with her, and I just happened to be in a bad mood. I even asked her if we could go to Great America sometime this summer. I don't know. I feel so bad. I'm sorry diane. I'm really truly sorry. It wasn't you, it was my bad mood and I'm sorry I took it out on you. That's what I'm going to tell her. I think that she'll understand. I think she knows what it's like to have a bad few days. I hope she does at least.",
    "Ohhh great, now Diane thinks I'm mad at her because of Pizza Hut and whatnot... :( It wasn't that I didn't have fun at Pizza Hut, it's that I was just in such a bad mood beforehand...that, I just didn't even really let myself have a good time. Oh well. I'll call her later and apologize. I didn't mean to bring my bad mood down on her, and I really did appreciate that she invited me. That was probably the one good thing about that day. Oh well, I'll talk to her and apologize and hopefully she'll forgive me.",

    "I apologize for the delay in writing, but I've had a packed weekend so far. Unfortunately, I just found out that I have a whopping 20 tests scheduled for Tuesday, courtesy of my demanding teachers. On a more positive note, I had a great time at our marching band practice yesterday. Since the weather wasn't cooperating, we stayed indoors, which allowed me to focus on perfecting my second part in the music section - it's going to be a breeze! I had to leave practice a bit early, around 5:00 pm, to meet up with friends for dinner. It was a special occasion, as it was Kelly's birthday, and we had a fantastic time celebrating. Afterwards, we headed to Kelly's place for a sleepover, where we had a blast doing all sorts of fun activities. I managed to get a decent night's sleep, considering it was a sleepover, since I had to be up early for a Bar Mitzvah ceremony this morning. The experience was really enlightening. Speaking of which, I'm currently working on a project for my Cultural Relativism (CR) class, which requires me to visit two places of worship that differ from my own. I've already attended a Jewish synagogue for the Bar Mitzvah, and I'm thinking of visiting a mosque for my second assignment, although I haven't finalized my plans yet. This is my only chance to write for now, so I'll have to wrap it up here. I'll try to update you again soon. *Ya di amore*",
    "Today was a bit of a struggle - I rolled in late and wasn't exactly feeling motivated. But, as usual, I ended up writing more than I thought I would! Nothing too exciting happened in class, but I did catch up with a few friends, including one special person who shall remain nameless. I know, I know, it's a tease! Anyway, the highlight of my day was definitely making it to the top of the rock climbing wall. Kelly and I are on a mission to conquer the whole thing now! And, of course, jazz practice was a blast as always. That's pretty much it for today. Hope you all had a great day and I'm off to get some well-deserved rest. *Ya di Amore*",
    "I'm okay with little people. I don't have a strong opinion about them, but I think it would be impolite to say 'Up with little people' instead of 'Down with little people'.",
    "Ugh, my parents are at it again! They've found yet another \"constructive\" way to ruin my day - cleaning! Can't they just let me enjoy my peaceful afternoon, free from homework and filled with the soothing sounds of jazz? But no, they had to come along and shatter my tranquility with their dreaded \"C\" word.\n\nI tried to resist, I really did. I gave them my usual response, \"Yeah, sure, fine, I'll clean\" - code for \"I'll do it later, maybe, possibly, never.\" But my mom had to go and use her guilt-trip voice on me, and before I knew it, I was trudging downstairs with a bucket and mop in hand.\n\nAs I scrubbed away at the bathroom, I couldn't help but dream of a life where I didn't have to lift a finger. A life where I could marry a rich guy, have a cleaning lady at my beck and call, and indulge in peanut butter sandwiches all day long. And when my husband eventually got tired of my, ahem, \"expanding\" figure, I'd be set - no prenup, no problem!\n\nOf course, there's just one tiny hitch - I'd need to become a witch to snag myself a wealthy beau. But now that I've shared my master plan with the world, I'll have to come up with a new scheme. Oh well, back to the drawing board!\n\nIn the meantime, I'm stuck writing to avoid human interaction. I wish I could escape to my happy place - the park. There's something about swinging high in the air, surrounded by nature, that clears my head and lifts my spirits. The only downside is when the little kids come along and stare at me like I'm a monster. I love watching them, though - they're so entertaining!\n\nI suppose that's enough rambling for now. I'll catch you all later, when I've come up with a new plan for world domination... or at least, a plan to get out of cleaning!",
    "\"I'm just going to vent about my supposedly 'horrible life' in my small town. Sarcasm often gets lost online, but I'll try anyway. Today was a pleasant surprise, despite being a Monday. I got a good night's sleep and even did my homework (miracles do happen!). The bus ride to school was tolerable, thanks to having some alone time with my trumpet.\n\nWhen I arrived at school, I caught up with friends, including Brandon, who was feeling a bit better. Carson stopped by to discuss the rumored new mitten policy, which she's not thrilled about. I also ran into cute Jake and some other friends from Speech Team.\n\nThe six-minute bell didn't ring, so I was late to Wind Ensemble. No big deal, though - my trumpet section is always a bit chaotic. We were supposed to have sectionals, but instead, we got a lecture from A. I played my music theory composition, which wasn't my best work, but at least it's done. Mrs. Kane also gave us a stern talk about our Lit Analysis papers... let's just say I'm not expecting an A.\n\nThe highlight of my day was definitely rock climbing in gym class. I'm hooked! The rest of my day was pretty uneventful, but the best part is that I don't have any homework. Now, I'm just wasting time writing this, but at least I'm being honest about it. Maybe I'll write more later if anything exciting happens. Until then, ~Ya di amore~\"\n\nI made some changes to enhance the passage's effectiveness:\n\n* Started with a more engaging opening sentence\n* Removed some of the repetitive language and phrases\n* Added more descriptive language to help the reader visualize the events\n* Emphasized the positive aspects of the day, like the good night's sleep and rock climbing\n* Made the tone more conversational and relatable\n* Removed some of the unnecessary details and focused on the more interesting parts of the day\n* Ended with a more conclusive sentence and a playful sign-off.",
    "It appears to be Alex, doesn't it? The distinctive nasal feature is quite pronounced, reminiscent of a certain facial characteristic. However, the smiley face adds a delightful touch of whimsy, rendering the overall effect utterly charming!",
    "I'm back, but only for a short time since I have a lesson soon. I'm just killing time and looking for something to do. I stumbled upon a penny, which got me thinking about who actually talks to their computer (I do!). It's funny because I also talk to my locker, Genevieve, at school. One thing that annoys me is using parentheses correctly - I use them a lot, but I'm not sure I'm doing it right. Anyway, I got distracted by a phone call from Steve, who's really cool and has awesome hair. We discussed chemistry, which I'm not a huge fan of. Last night's humanities event was a bit of a disaster, but let's just forget about it. It's weird that I don't have any homework and had a free afternoon, but it's nice to have some extra time. I love jazz, but it's also nice to have a break. I'm aware that my writing is all over the place, but that's just me being spontaneous! Oh, and guess what? I went on the high ropes course yesterday and made it across the swinging balance beam with Peter, although our teacher, Mr. Z, found something wrong with our technique. I should probably go warm up for my trumpet lesson now. It's been fun writing all this random stuff, and I hope you've enjoyed it too!",
    "The sweet taste of freedom! It's been ages since I last put pen to paper, and I'm thrilled to finally have a moment to catch my breath. The past few weeks have been a whirlwind of adventure, starting with the magical world of Disney. I know, I know, it sounds like a cliché, but trust me, it was pure bliss! Even the dreaded bus ride, which I was dreading, turned out to be a pleasant surprise. Who knew 31 hours on a bus could be, dare I say it, fun?\n\nBut as amazing as Disney was, it's great to be back home, surrounded by the comforts of familiarity. And, let me tell you, I've learned a valuable lesson: never go on vacation with friends for more than two days. It's a recipe for disaster! By day three, the camaraderie turns into catty remarks and eye-rolling. Not exactly the most relaxing experience.\n\nOn a more positive note, I've finally caught up on my make-up work (yay, me!), and I'm thoroughly enjoying my journalism project. I'm writing a feature story on the age-old battle between teenagers and adults, and the research is fascinating. It's amazing how much I'm learning about myself and others through this process.\n\nIn other news, our jazz band had a gig on Wednesday, and I managed to arrive just in time for the final song – the one I had a solo in, of course! Talk about timing. Oh well, these things happen, right?\n\nAs I wrap up this update, I'm off to the mall to indulge in some retail therapy. And, fingers crossed, maybe, just maybe, it'll snow soon. A girl can dream, right? *Ya Di Amore*",
    "I'm feeling extremely happy and content after finishing dinner. I'm currently chatting with friends while doing homework and watching Law & Order, which I'm proud to say is a impressive multitasking feat. \n\nToday was a great day, with no band or music theory classes, which was a welcome break. During lunch, I hung out with friends Kristen, Chris, Kelly, and Emily. Later, I sat alone in a practice room to avoid feeling left out when Chris and Kelly worked on music together.\n\nEPVM class was interesting, but I'm getting anxious about my upcoming final exam. My brother, who has perfect ACT and SAT scores, warned me that it's challenging, which is making me even more nervous.\n\nGym class was particularly painful, especially during the Commando Crawl exercise. I highly recommend wearing pants instead of shorts for that activity! \n\nThe rest of my day was uneventful, with math class being boring as usual. I had lunch with friends and attended Comparative Religion and chemistry classes, which were also unremarkable. After coming home, I did some tasks and now I'm wrapping up my day. That's all for now!",
    "I'm still on cloud nine after getting a ton of compliments on my new hairdo! I took the plunge and got it cut and layered last night, and I'm absolutely loving the fresh look. It's shorter, but still totally fabulous! \n\nNow, I'm on a mission to revamp my room with some new furniture. I'm keeping the wood floor, though - it's a lifesaver when it comes to cleaning up spills (which, let's be real, are a regular occurrence for me).\n\nAs I wait for dinner to be ready, I'm dreading the looming Science test. Ugh, Science is just not my thing! But, I'm getting a late arrival tomorrow, and that's definitely something to celebrate! I was worried we didn't have one scheduled, but Bryan (with a y) set me straight - a little harshly, but I'll take it.\n\nOf course, the late arrival is bittersweet, since finals are just around the corner and I'm nowhere near ready. I've somehow managed to do okay without studying much since high school started, but I know I need to buckle down and focus. For me, it's not the tests that are the problem - it's the homework. If I could just get into a routine, I know I'd be golden!\n\nAnyway, dinner is calling, and I'll catch you all up later!",
    "I'm guilty of procrastinating on my homework once again, but I have a good excuse - I just painted my nails and I can type without ruining them. I'll get back to my assignments soon, I promise!\n\nToday was an amazing day, though. I had the chance to see a certain someone I've been crushing on, and he actually noticed me and spoke to me twice! It was exhilarating, to say the least.\n\nSchool wasn't so bad either. I decided to sit with my close friends during morning break instead of waiting outside the band room, and we had a blast. It's always great to catch up with them. Kathryn was working on her paper, and Joanne and John were being their adorable selves. They make such a lovely couple, and I have to admit, I get a little envious sometimes. I've been thinking about asking someone to the Winter dance, but I'm still undecided on who to ask.\n\nKelly S. was her usual cool self, complaining about things as usual, but I love her anyway. In band, Peter was absent, so I didn't have to deal with the usual teasing. It was actually a bit unsettling, as I've grown accustomed to their daily jokes.\n\nMusic theory was okay, but I'm seriously considering dropping the class. I don't feel like I'm learning much, and it's not really my cup of tea. Kelly Coyle got a bit upset with me about it, but I have to do what's best for me.\n\nEPVM was, well, EPVM - not exactly thrilling. We had a substitute teacher, so it was a pretty uneventful class. But gym was a different story altogether! I went on the high ropes course, and it was terrifying... yet exhilarating! Mehgan and I rocked it, completing three courses. We could have done more if Allen hadn't wasted our time.\n\nMy watch fell off while I was on the course, and I freaked out! Kelly got upset with Erica, and I hope no one's mad at me right now. I hate it when people are upset with me.\n\nMath was, well, math. But I've finally figured out the secret to my teacher's methods, and he's actually a great instructor if you can stay awake in his class.\n\nI have to run now - I'm off to get my hair cut. I'll write more later!",
    "I just finished my paper and now my mom is checking it for mistakes. I'm a bit worried because I've gotten out of practice writing normally. My teacher, Mrs. Kane, taught us to write in a journalistic style, and now I keep thinking about whether my writing is objective or not. It's really annoying!\n\nI was talking to my friend Bryan about jazz, and I'm trying to forgive someone who did something that bothered me a lot. They didn't ask me or tell me about it, and it's hard to forgive. But I know it's the right thing to do.\n\nThis weekend has been pretty cool. I've been reading a lot - three good books, actually. I also watched the movie Pretty Woman last night, and it was really sweet. I love the quote from the Bible that says \"Love is patient, love is kind...\" It's so true and beautiful.\n\nI also saw another great quote today from Dr. Seuss: \"Be who you are and say what you feel, because those who matter don't mind.\" I think it's really true too.\n\nAnyway, I need to go finish my conversation with Bryan and then go to bed. I'm looking forward to sleeping!",
    "I'm putting off my homework for now to chat with Brandon. To be honest, I'm really anxious about the upcoming jazz competition. Even though I don't have any solos, I'm still worried about performing well, especially with a challenging piece like 'Jumpin' at the Westside'. I can already imagine myself getting nervous on stage. Ugh, it's not helping that I've been sick for the past week. First, it was a cold, and then I developed an ear infection. I'm so over being sick! Anyway, I'll come back to this later. Right now, I need to focus on finishing my paper. I'm determined to get it done. Until next time, ya di amore...",
    "I'm so excited! I'm taking my music theory final right now. I had a jazz class today and I did okay. When the teacher asked me a question, I didn't get nervous and refuse to answer. That's good! I didn't have any other finals today. I had lunch, then band practice (which was really hard), and then Comparative Religion class (but we didn't have a final). The rest of my day has been boring, so I might write more later if something interesting happens. But probably not!",
    "I ultimately decided not to go, but what really made a difference was talking to Chris about everything that was weighing on my mind. I'm so grateful for his listening ear - he's truly one of the most empathetic people I know. At first, I was hesitant to open up to him, but he gently coaxed me into sharing my concerns, and I'm thankful he did. It was a huge relief to finally express my emotions and unburden myself.\n\nFor the first time in a long while, I allowed myself to cry - a cathartic release that I desperately needed. One of the things that's been troubling me is the lingering grief I still feel after my grandmother's passing. I miss her dearly, and I think I need to allow myself to process my emotions more often. Bottling them up only leads to overwhelming feelings of sadness and frustration.\n\nOn a deeper level, I've been struggling with feelings of insecurity and self-doubt. I yearn for someone to appreciate me for who I am, without condition or expectation. It's disheartening to feel like my efforts to be a good person go unnoticed. I know I'm not perfect, but I try my best, and it's hard not to wonder what's lacking.\n\nWriting about these feelings has been therapeutic, and I'm grateful to have trusted friends like Chris who can offer a supportive ear. Even if no one reads this, it's been helpful for me to articulate my emotions and reflect on my experiences. With that, I'll bid you goodnight.",
    "I'm frustrated with myself for complaining about winter, especially when I have it better than most people on this planet. My issue is that I don't have a date to a popular event, which is entirely my own fault for not asking someone. It's disappointing to see that everyone else has a date, and I'm feeling left out.",
    "Get ready for a thrilling tale of a day that was anything but ordinary!\n\nAs I'm writing this, my eyelids are drooping, and my beauty sleep is calling my name. But before I surrender to my pillow, let me fill you in on the excitement that unfolded today.\n\nWe kicked off the day with a late arrival, which was a lovely surprise. But the real twist came when we found out Mr. Alstadt would be MIA for the next two days. I was really looking forward to diving into music theory with him, but I guess that'll have to wait.\n\nThe day was cruising along smoothly until I received a mysterious summons to Mrs. Plumber's office... Dun dun dun! But don't worry, it was just a mix-up, and all is well now.\n\nNext up was jazz practice, where I had to deal with Nathan's lack of leadership skills and Tom's non-stop chatter. I think Steve would make a fantastic section leader – he's all about perfecting our sound. \n\nAfter jazz, I headed home for my lesson, and that was pretty much it for the day. I know, I know, it sounds like a snooze-fest, but bear with me!\n\nOn a more serious note, I want to share some sad news. My amazing great uncle Al passed away a few days ago. He was an incredible person, and I'd be grateful if you could spare a thought and a prayer for his wife and close family.\n\nThat's all for tonight, folks! Thanks for sticking with me, and I hope you have a fantastic evening. XOXO",
    "I am deeply saddened by the absence of Heather in my life. She was a trusted confidante with whom I shared my innermost thoughts and feelings. Her presence is profoundly missed, and I am filled with a sense of longing for her companionship.",
    "Today was a slight improvement from yesterday, and it all started with a better morning. I've come to realize that my day often sets its tone from the moment I wake up. I managed to get my schedule changed and cleared the air with Kathryn, which was a huge relief. I was worried about her being upset with me, and I'm glad we're on the same page now.\n\nBut despite this small victory, I couldn't shake off the feeling of being utterly alone. It's as if the whole world is against me, and it's a terrible feeling. I miss having close friends like Amanda, Hillary, and Kelly, people I could turn to when things get tough. Lately, I've been feeling a deep sadness, and I'm not sure why.\n\nWhat I really crave is a meaningful connection with someone, a best friend or even a romantic partner. Someone who would listen to me, understand me, and be there for me. But it feels like that's just a pipe dream right now.\n\nI was looking forward to going to Winter, but now I realize it wasn't the place I wanted to go to - it was the person I wanted to go with. I wanted to share the experience with someone I truly cared about, not just a friend. It's all just feeling really tough right now, and I'm struggling to hold back tears.\n\nListening to Dave Matthews is usually a comfort, but even that's not lifting my mood today. I guess I just needed to vent and have an 'emotional breakdown' moment. Sorry about that! Anyway, I have to go - people are waiting to chat with me. Maybe I'll write more later.",
    "So, the Bucs won. Meh. I'm not exactly a huge football fan, which is weird since my whole family is obsessed and I'm in marching band. Yeah, I'm a total oddball. Anyway, we've got a bit of a situation on our hands. I might finally get to go to Winter (yay!), but that means Kelly's getting left out. We're thinking maybe she could tag along with Neil, since we all know him and it'd be a blast. We don't wanna ditch her. I wish I could invite Kristen, Alex, Taylor, and her bf too, but I'm not sure if Kathryn and Joanne would be cool with that. Honestly, I'm super confused right now. Ugh, school tomorrow is gonna be a drag. It feels like we shouldn't have to go, maybe because of the Super Bowl or something. I should probably just stop writing before I say something I don't mean to. I still can't believe we actually placed yesterday...but I'm dying to know how many bands were there. We got 5th...out of 5 bands. Oops. Haha, except that was last year, and this year we totally killed it! Wait, why did I just say that? Yeah, I'm a weirdo. And now I'm talking to myself too...okay, time for bed. Night, guys! Hope you have sweet dreams!!! :)",
    "Super Bowl Sunday blues got me feeling stuck, but my mind is racing like a quarterback on a mission! I've been pondering life's big questions, like my Winter trip plans. I said I wanted to go, but now I'm having second thoughts. Don't get me wrong, I adore my friend, but I wish I was going with someone who sets my heart aflutter. It's not that I don't appreciate our friendship, but...sigh.\n\nOn a brighter note, I'm craving some solo time to clear my head. Remember Emily on our Disney adventure? Yeah, I'm feeling like that right now. But, chatting with Joanne and Kristen has got me pumped up for Winter! It'll be a blast with our fun squad! \n\nAnd, yay for me, I'm having actual conversations with people who aren't glued to the TV! Silver linings, right?",
    "I'm still in shock after the recent competition. I wish I could have seen more class AA bands perform. JSO didn't win any awards, which surprised me considering how talented they are. As Alex said, \"There must have been some seriously Godly bands if they beat JSO!\"\n\nOn a more personal note, our Jazz Band placed 3rd, which is still an accomplishment. I'm glad we were able to place, especially since JSO didn't. My solo performance went okay, but I know I need to work on playing louder and improving my timing.\n\nI'm also happy to see that Diane seems to be doing well, which is all that matters to me. With no homework tonight, I'm looking forward to doing something fun! I might write more later, but for now, I'm just going to enjoy the evening.",
    "I'm taking a moment to reflect on a tough experience. I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed, but I'm acknowledging my emotions and taking responsibility for my actions. Instead of beating myself up, I'm choosing to learn from my mistakes and move forward with a growth mindset.",
    "I'm lying awake, my mind racing with worry. I get too worked up over things like this, but honestly, I'm devastated. I just found out that Zach is in surgery and Richa has internal bleeding - it's just awful. And to make matters worse, I heard there was another accident that claimed a student's life. It's all so heartbreaking. All I want is for everyone to be safe, but it feels like that's too much to ask. I wish I had someone to talk to right now, but everyone I know is fast asleep. I'm torn between tears and...I don't know, just feeling numb. I've already cried, but it's hard not to when you care about people, even if you don't know them that well. It's just not fair - Zach and Richa are both so smart and kind...why did this have to happen to them? I feel like I should tell the people I care about how much they mean to me, but it's hard for me to express my emotions like that. It's just so sad. Sometimes I wish I could go back to the simpler days of elementary and junior high, when it felt like everyone was safe. Now, I just feel helpless - I want to do something to help, but what can I do? I'll pray, but it feels like I should be doing something more, something tangible. Maybe I just need to clear my head. I was going to write about my day, but it doesn't seem important right now. All I can do is hope that Zach and Richa are okay.",
    "I'm struggling to understand why bad things happen to good people. Tonight, two amazing individuals were in a car accident and are now in stable condition. It's unfair that this happened to them, as they're kind and contribute so much to our school and community. I hope they recover quickly and will be praying for them.\n\nThis incident has made me appreciate my own life and the blessings I have, including a loving family, financial security, and good health. It's a harsh reminder to be grateful for what I have.\n\nI often get frustrated with people who seem selfish, but I realize I can be guilty of the same thing. A friend reminded me that in difficult times, I need to have faith. I do pray every night, but sometimes I just go through the motions. From now on, I'll make a conscious effort to truly think about who and what I'm praying for, starting with Richa and Zach. I hope others will join me in praying for their recovery.",
    "I'm having trouble stopping myself from typing away on this thing. It's like my two index fingers have a mind of their own! Despite only using two fingers, I'm surprisingly fast. I think typing nonstop is helping me avoid thinking about my upcoming audition and all the anxiety that comes with it. \n\nI'm chatting with Brett and Matthew, and it's great to talk to them. I'm trying not to bring up the audition, though. \n\nOn a separate note, I had a conversation with someone about relationships and values. I'd rather be seen as a prude who can't get guys than be known as someone who can get guys but lacks self-respect. If I'm going to take risks, I want it to be with someone I'm committed to for the long haul. Sorry, I guess I got sidetracked again!",
    "Ugh, I'm cringing just thinking about it - I sounded like a total goofball, didn't I? Petty, dumb, and selfish, all wrapped up in a big ol' bow of ridiculousness. But you know what? At least I can laugh at myself! In fact, I think I might've set a new personal record for most 'hahas' in a single conversation. Hahahahahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahaha! On a more serious note, though... am I always this loony, or was that just a one-time special?",
    "My Favorite Things :-)\n\nI'm feeling happy today, and I thought I'd share some things that bring a smile to my face:\n\n* Sharp objects that catch my eye\n* Pointy objects that add an edge to my day\n* Shiny objects that sparkle with excitement\n* Quacky ducks and charming penguins\n* Oxymorons that intrigue me\n* People with a pleasant scent\n* My lovely locks of hair\n* Individuals with names starting with Z or Q - there's something unique about them!\n* Permanent markers that bring color to my life\n* My favorite nail polish shades\n* Metronomes that keep me in rhythm\n* The smooth sounds of jazz\n* The beauty of Italy\n* People who make me feel special\n* Outplaying Dan at trumpet (and doing it again the following year!)\n* The soothing sound of valve oil\n* My cozy bed, where I can relax\n* Comfy hoodies that keep me warm\n* Embracing my quirks and being a little unconventional\n* And, of course, you! You bring joy to my life.\n\nI'm feeling uplifted today, but I think I'll save my list of dislikes for a rainy day. For now, I'm basking in the semi-decent weather and feeling grateful. Until next time, peace out! XOXO :)",

    "Top Ten Qualities to Look for in a Romantic Partner\n\nWhile the following list is not in any particular order, it highlights the key characteristics that make a person an attractive and desirable partner.\n\n1. Intelligence: A high level of intellectual curiosity and cognitive ability is an essential quality in a partner.\n\n2. Sense of Humor: A good sense of humor can help navigate life's challenges and create a more enjoyable and lighthearted atmosphere.\n\n3. Kindness: Empathy, compassion, and a willingness to help others are vital traits in a romantic partner.\n\n4. Strong Morals: A partner with a strong moral compass is essential for building trust and a healthy relationship.\n\n5. Personal Hygiene: Good grooming and personal hygiene are important aspects of physical attraction.\n\n6. Effective Communication: The ability to engage in stimulating and meaningful conversations is crucial for a successful partnership.\n\n7. Enjoyable Company: A partner who is fun to be around and can create a positive atmosphere is highly desirable.\n\n8. Physical Attraction: While not a necessity, physical attraction can be an added bonus in a romantic relationship.\n\n9. Sensitivity: Emotional intelligence and sensitivity towards one's partner are essential for building a strong and healthy bond.\n\n10. Trustworthiness: Trust is a fundamental component of any successful relationship, and a partner who is reliable and honest is highly valued.\n\nIt is often puzzling to observe individuals who possess many of these qualities ending up in relationships with partners who lack them. This phenomenon is a common occurrence, and its causes are not always clear.\n\nIn conclusion, I will refrain from further elaboration, as I have exhausted my thoughts on this topic.",
    "I'm feeling conflicted despite achieving a goal - I made it to 5th chair in band, beating Dan, which was a great moment. However, I'm still in a bad mood and feeling unfulfilled. I've been trying to figure out who I am and feeling like I'm just imitating others instead of being myself. I want to be my old carefree and fun self, but I'm struggling to find my identity. I'm also feeling untrustworthy, which is something I need to work on. I'm confused and don't feel passionate about anything, including the \"A\" audition that I used to worry about. I'm just feeling sad and unmotivated, which is unusual for me. Maybe it's just a bad day, but I'm hoping to shake it off and have some fun shopping with my mom.",
    "I still don't regret what I said, and it's funny that Jim thought I was referring to Dave K. when I mentioned it. Actually, I thought Dave K. was upset with me today, which was strange. Anyway, school was uneventful, but Mr. A. reassured me that everything is fine, so I'm not worried. I had a decent jazz practice today, and I was playing at a good volume. Overall, my day was pretty dull, and I don't feel like typing much right now. Maybe not later either. You know who this is from, and if you don't, well... XOXO",
    "The agony of anticipation! I'm stuck in limbo, waiting to find out if I made the Wind Ensemble. I was promised the results today, but alas, they're nowhere to be found. The powers that be have decided to keep me on tenterhooks, teasing me with a \"maybe tomorrow\" instead. I'm left feeling frustrated and restless, my excitement and nerves tangled in a knot. I guess all I can do is take a deep breath and wait...",
    "I'm beyond thrilled! I just can't help but express my excitement. Today has been a better day, as I've been able to focus on the audition and other things. Although I still have some lingering thoughts about it, I'm trying not to dwell on it too much. The suspense is killing me, though - the results come out tomorrow, but not until the afternoon! It's frustrating to have to wait, but I just want to know either way so I can move forward. Oh well, I'll just have to be patient. On the bright side, I'm happy with who I am, and that's all that matters!",
    "I'm feeling surprisingly calm and reflective today, and I think I know why. I finally got things off my chest last night, and it's a huge relief. I know I repeated myself a lot, but it was therapeutic to share my thoughts with someone who listens. Now, I'm actually looking forward to Monday - it can't come soon enough! The weekend is usually a time to unwind, but this time it's feeling a bit slow. I took a break from writing to get lost in my favorite book, Tangerine. I've read it a couple of times before, but it still resonates with me. There's something comforting about revisiting a familiar story. With my mom leaving for a business trip soon, I think I'll just take it easy today and enjoy some quiet time with my book.",
    "Hmm, it's been ages since I last penned something. Anyway, the blues club was last evening. It was utterly fantastic. I was thoroughly astonished... I wasn't anticipating having a blast at all. I didn't even feel like attending. I grooved all through the orchestra's performance. It was incredibly enjoyable. Heh, anyway, I really don't have anything more to add. I think I'm going to take off actually. I'll probably scribble more later.  Goodnight, noble lords and ladies.  :)",

I'm supposed to be tackling this ridiculously hard government crossword puzzle, but let's be real, it's a total nightmare! It's like they want me to pull my hair out or something. I mean, who creates a puzzle that's worth more than the actual test? \n\nAnyway, enough about that torture device. My weekend was pretty chill, I guess. I didn't do much, just lounged around and... wait for it... CLEANED MY ROOM! Like, really cleaned it. I'm talking washed floors, dusted furniture, the whole shebang! It's amazing, but also kind of weird because everything is so... tidy. I know, I know, it's a strange problem to have.\n\nOh, and I found out I didn't have a gig, which is a relief. But I did end up ditching plans with Kathryn to grab lunch with some other friends. Oops. I hope she's not too mad at me. We'll catch up soon, maybe over coffee? Speaking of which, I'm one of the few people who don't actually like the taste of coffee, but the smell is amazing! \n\nCan you tell I'm procrastinating like crazy? Yeah, I thought so. Well, I guess it's back to the homework grind for me. Wish me luck! XOXO",

I asked her several questions about her vegetarian lifestyle, driven by genuine curiosity since I've never met a vegetarian before. I didn't mean to cause any discomfort, but I sense that she might be upset. I hope it's just a coincidence and not a result of our conversation.",
    "I have mixed feelings about sharing my thoughts with others. Sometimes I'm thrilled that people are listening to what I have to say, but other times I wish they wouldn't pay attention. It's a double-edged sword, really. On one hand, I'm grateful that my words can resonate with people like Andrew, who thinks I'm quirky and amusing. On the other hand, it can be overwhelming and even a bit unsettling.\n\nSpeaking of which, I'm still unsure about this potential jazz gig I might have landed. I'm both excited and terrified at the prospect! If it doesn't work out, I can always say I didn't know what I was getting myself into.\n\nOn a more pleasant note, I had a blast going out to lunch with Diane and Joanne today. We shared some hilarious moments and reminisced about old times. However, I did feel a pang of guilt when Diane and I started discussing our marching band experiences, leaving Joanne out of the loop. It's a habit of mine that I need to break, as I don't want to make others feel excluded.\n\nDespite that, it was wonderful to look back on freshman year and appreciate how far I've come. Sophomore year has its own charm, and I'm grateful for the experiences I'm having. As I wrap up this entry, I'm reminded that if I hadn't learned to cope with my emotions years ago, I might be losing my mind right about now! XOXO",

    "I've been pondering a peculiar parallel between my life and the wizarding world of Harry Potter. Just as Harry relies on his invisibility cloak to navigate Hogwarts under the cover of darkness, I often feel invisible in my daily interactions, despite my striking white hair. It's as if I'm a mere afterthought, perpetually relegated to second or third place in the eyes of others. The exceptions, of course, are my treasured friends Kelly and Emily, who consistently make me feel seen and valued, on par with their own special bond. But then there are those who, with their careless words and actions, leave me feeling like an afterthought, a mere backup plan. The sting of being told, 'We'll get back to you once we've confirmed everyone else is free,' still lingers. It's a frustrating, disheartening experience that I struggle to shake off. Oh well, just a thought... XOXO",
    "I'm totally heartbroken about my brother leaving! I didn't expect to feel this way, but I'm really going to miss him so much! It's hard to believe he's actually gone, and it's hitting me hard. What's really getting to me is realizing how little time I have left to spend with my amazing family before I head off to college in two years and start my own adventure. I feel so lucky to have a family that I genuinely love spending time with - we have the best conversations and they're my escape from the drama and superficiality of high school. I'm really going to cherish every moment I have with them from now on!",

On a more positive note, I'm looking forward to spending time with them.\n\nEarlier today, I had a disappointing experience with a speech I gave. It didn't go well, and I'm not eager to think about it again. On a lighter note, I wore a skirt today, which is something I'm still getting used to.\n\nAnyway, my mom just called to say she's on her way home from the airport, so I'm going to go get ready for dinner.

Nope! And to add insult to injury, he had the audacity to cancel our sessions for the next two weeks! The nerve of this guy is staggering. He's always harping on about our lack of consistency in rehearsals, but it seems he's the one who can't get his act together.\n\nI'm so frustrated that I can't even vent in my real diary - it's online, but currently locked and inaccessible. It's like the universe is conspiring against me to keep my emotions bottled up. But I'm not one to give up easily. I'll try to calm down and tackle this again. Wish me luck!",

    "Today was pretty uneventful, and to be honest, I don't even remember most of what I did. I was feeling really out of it. I did get a good laugh, though, when I wore my black hoodie with the hood up and nobody recognized me at first because they're used to seeing my hair. Plus, I looked pretty tired, and five people told me I looked stoned this morning, which was pretty amusing.\n\nThere's some drama going on at school, though. Apparently, four ACT answer booklets were stolen, and the juniors might have to retake the test. They even had an assembly about it. It's a pretty messed-up situation.\n\nI'm also really frustrated with group work in math. It's just so annoying. On a more positive note, I got really lucky on my government packet today. I don't want to go into details, but I managed to score 33/35, and I'm really grateful to someone who helped me out. It was a huge relief.\n\nI think I'm going to stop typing in this public area, though. It's getting old, and I'm considering going back to keeping a private diary. I've been typing in both, but it's too much work for me. From now on, I might just stick to my private diary.",

My mind works in mysterious ways.\n\nSchool was okay today, nothing out of the ordinary. I caught up with many of my friends and had a great conversation with Emily over lunch. I think Dave might have read one of my entries, because he's been nicer to me lately, especially since Jazz Cafe. Maybe he's just gone back to his old self. I really hope so - I missed the old Dave. He was so different from most guys. Ugh, guys can be annoying sometimes.\n\nThis past weekend was pretty low-key. The only exciting thing I did was hang out with Chris, Jim, and Alex. We had a blast! Alex's mom even treated us to a delicious dinner. Then, we headed to Chris's place to watch Swimfan and The Matrix, which I hadn't seen before. Wow, The Matrix is an amazing movie! I usually don't enjoy that type of film, but this one was so cool.\n\nI have to go soon - we have a gig at Ellsworth Elementary. It'll be fun, and I hope we get to see the kids play. That would be awesome and do wonders for my self-esteem.\n\nBefore I go, I want to share a mean saying I heard the other day. I thought it was funny at first, but now I feel terrible for laughing. It was, \"I'm outta here like the fat kid in dodgeball.\" That's just cruel, isn't it? I still can't believe I laughed.\n\nAnyway, I'm out of here. I probably won't write again tonight due to my heavy homework load.\n\nGoodnight, princes and princesses! :)",

I wish I could've gone to Kohl's with Brandon instead!\n\nAnyway, I should probably get started on that homework... Ugh, I know, I know. It's not the most exciting thing to do, but it's gotta be done. Bye for now!",
    "I'm relieved to report that Chris no longer harbors any ill will towards me, yet I find myself still grappling with a lingering sense of melancholy. The source of this sentiment eludes me, and I'm convinced that there must be an underlying reason, hidden from my conscious awareness. Nevertheless, the uncertainty is nothing short of infuriating.",
    "I snapped at Chris last night because I was in a bad mood, not because I was upset with him. I regret my shortness and hope he can forgive me.",
    "Had a much-needed chat with Kathryn over the phone earlier. I'm grateful she was available to talk. Now, I'm thinking of reaching out to someone else - I don't feel like spending the rest of the night alone.",
    "I'm consumed by a profound sense of isolation, craving the warmth of human connection and intimacy. The absence of someone to share a gentle touch, a listening ear, and a comforting presence feels like a gaping void. Even surrounded by a crowd, I'd still feel like an island, disconnected and unseen. What I yearn for is a deep, meaningful bond with someone who understands and cares for me, someone I can trust with my innermost thoughts and emotions. Right now, I'm drawn to the idea of spending time with Joanne, Kathryn, Kelly, and Mary Clare, people with whom I can engage in authentic, heart-to-hearts, and shed tears without fear of judgment. I need a supportive presence, a shoulder to lean on, but it's elusive, leaving me feeling empty and forlorn. The air I breathe, essential for survival, seems hollow and unfulfilling, offering no solace from my sorrow. While being around others may provide a temporary distraction, it's a fleeting respite from the ache of loneliness that persists, leaving me feeling sad and unfulfilled.",
    "I just got out of the shower and I'm feeling amazing! Showers always leave me feeling refreshed and energized. Today is going to be a great day, no matter what happens!",
    "I would like to take a moment to express my appreciation for Diane, who consistently demonstrates exceptional kindness and a remarkable ability to uplift my spirits. Similarly, Joanne has also shown a talent for providing comfort and support. I am grateful for their presence in my life.",
    "I'm pleased to report that my ire has significantly diminished following a conversation with a particular individual. My gratitude is extended to you, dear confidant. I must admit that I required a specific type of interaction this evening, and I'm relieved to have found it. Although I'm still somewhat perplexed as to why my emotions have shifted, I'm grateful to have shed my anger. Earlier, I was consumed by frustration, disillusionment, and annoyance, but I'm confident that a new day will bring a fresh perspective. Until then, I bid you goodnight.",
    "Hey! You're literally the best person I know! One of you awesome people is doing an amazing job of lifting my mood. Thanks so much!",
    "At this moment, I'm feeling emotionally drained and only comfortable confiding in a select few individuals who I trust and value deeply. Specifically, I would only want to have conversations with my mother, who has always been a source of comfort and guidance, and my close friends Ryan and Alex, who have consistently demonstrated empathy and understanding in our relationships.",
    "I'm baffled by my own emotions - why do I feel like I'm walking on hot coals around certain people, while others can do no wrong in my eyes? What's behind this Jekyll-and-Hyde reaction, and how can I crack the code to understanding myself better?",
    "I'm feeling really frustrated and let down right now. It's not what I was hoping for, and it's okay to acknowledge those emotions. I'm taking a moment to process and move forward.",
    "Shoutout to the coolest person in the world, Ryan Dewitt! You deserve an award! Thanks, Ryan. I love you!",
    "I'm relieved to discover that Peter doesn't have any ill feelings towards me. I dislike the idea of being disliked by others, it's an unpleasant feeling.",
    "The past few days have been a welcome respite from the chaos. I've been battling illness all week, so I finally took a much-needed break and stayed home. The extra sleep has already started to work its magic, and I'm feeling slightly more human.\n\nMarching band tryouts were a breeze, and I'm relieved I stuck with it. Watching the senior movie with the song \"We Go On\" from my freshman year show was a nostalgic but emotional experience.\n\nBut the real drama unfolded last night when Chris dropped a bombshell, asking if he should reveal his true feelings about me. I was caught off guard, unsure if he was serious or not. Luckily, we're just good friends, and I couldn't imagine anything romantic between us. It's frustrating when people assume that just because I have close guy friends, I must have romantic feelings for them. Newsflash: friendship is possible without romance!\n\nI had a great conversation with Bryan about this very issue, and I'm grateful to have him as a friend. Let's set the record straight: I value my friendships with guys, but that doesn't mean I'm interested in dating them. Can we please put this misconception to rest?",
    "I recently stumbled upon an old journal entry where I wrote about how I couldn't forgive someone for hurting a loved one. But the more I think about it, the more I realize that forgiveness isn't mine to give. It belongs to the person who was wronged. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I still believe what he did was completely unacceptable and I'd do everything in my power to protect her from harm again. But forgiveness is a personal choice that only she can make. \n\nI know this might be hard for some people to understand, but writing this down has been a therapeutic release for me. It's a reminder that sometimes, we need to respect the boundaries of others and let them take ownership of their own healing process.",
    "I'm feeling happy today because of a nice conversation with Katharine that made me feel special. But I'm also dealing with a cold, courtesy of my mom, and it's making my head, nose, and eyes hurt. I have an eye doctor appointment tomorrow, which isn't ideal. On a separate note, I'm considering joining marching band, but there's some confusion about leadership roles between Brandon and Peter. Despite the chaos, my overall mood is happy.",
    "I'm over the moon! You really care about me! No, seriously, this is the best day ever! \n\nOf course, I adore you! You're an amazing individual, and I think you're one of the most awesome people I've met.\n\nHaha, I don't know about that... there are so many cool people at Central.\n\nBut in my book, you stand out from the crowd. You're intelligent, talented in music, and unapologetically yourself. You don't let others dictate your actions or opinions. Plus, you're kind to everyone you meet. Those are some truly special qualities!",
    "It's astonishing that he fails to recognize her evident disinterest in engaging with him. Despite his repeated attempts to initiate contact, she has deliberately chosen not to reciprocate, ignoring his three phone calls. It's a common phenomenon, unfortunately, for men to be oblivious to such clear signals. As for me, I find it impossible to condone his past behavior towards her. Alas, I've resigned myself to the fact that high school relationships are often fraught with difficulties. The only exception that comes to mind is the exemplary relationship between John and Joannes, which I hold in high esteem.",
    "It has long been a philosophical conundrum of mine: why do good fortune and prosperity often seem to elude those who are genuinely deserving of them?",
    "Forget it. It's just not worth the effort. I deserve to be appreciated for who I am, not because I'm trying to impress others or win their approval.",
    "I'm still searching for my 'someone' - that one special soul who can flip the script on a chaotic world, making the darkness a little brighter and the loneliness a little more bearable. Until then, I hold onto the hope that they're out there, waiting to be found.",
    "I'm fed up with being constantly teased and belittled by everyone at school. It hurts to feel like no one truly cares about me or accepts me for who I am. Even when I try to be a good person, I get shot down and made fun of. It's especially frustrating when people mock my poor eyesight, something I have no control over.\n\nI'm tired of being treated like it's okay to be mean and heartless, while those who do wrong things are praised and admired. It's like being a good person is a bad thing. I've had enough of the constant negativity and disrespect from my peers.\n\nI've lost respect for most people at my school and can't wait for summer break to get away from it all. I wish I could stay in Michigan, away from the toxic environment and people who only care about being popular. I'm exhausted from trying to fit in and be liked, only to be disappointed and hurt time and time again.\n\nFour years of high school are supposed to be some of the best years of my life, but so far, they've been a constant struggle. I'm sick of wasting my time on people who don't truly care about me, and I'm ready for a change.",
    "Today has been a bit of a downer. I'm feeling melancholy and wish I could spend time with a certain someone. Despite knowing I shouldn't have feelings for him, I can't help but think it would be fun to hang out with him outside of school. Oh well, maybe some other time.\n\nOn a brighter note, I'm looking forward to watching Bruce Almighty with Kathryn tonight. It'll be a blast! Yesterday was a great day, though. School was uneventful, but the One Acts performance with Kelly, Kathryn, and Joanne was hilarious. Mary Clare even gave us a funny ear tug hello from the stage! During intermission, we hung out with some band friends and got a bit wild. It was a really fun night. Now, I'm off to the movies with Kathryn. Later!",
    "I'm unsure of my mood right now. Despite her reassurance that everything is fine, I still sense that she's upset with me. She told me not to worry about her, but it's hard for me to shake off the feeling. I care deeply about her and never want to say anything that might hurt her. I think I need some time to reflect on this and clear my head.",
    "Whoa, so, yeah. Yesterday was awesome. I managed to get through the entire school day without uttering a word. It was quite an adventure. I earned $20, too - Woohoo! But, yeah, I couldn't jot down that I was in a wager with someone, or speak obviously, so...I had to get one person to figure it out. Luckily, after that one person guessed, it was easier, because I got them to spread the word to others, etc. It was a blast. So, then I headed home, couldn't find my outfit for the concert, and totally freaked out. Haha. I eventually found it, but...still. Um, I attended the concert, and it was a lot of fun. We didn't perform horribly, surprisingly. I was amazed. The concert band was okay. Kristen and I sat there and came up with six cool things about them. 1.) Red bow ties, 2.) Recognizable tunes, 3.) Good rhythm, 4.) When they stood up, they formed this arch-like shape, tallest in the middle, and shortest at the edges, 5.) Mr. S! 6.) Hmm, I don't recall. Oh well. We did come up with six, after all. \n\nSo, it was an enjoyable day overall, but I was relieved to get home and catch some Z's. It was exhilarating. I actually slept the entire night without waking up once. I must've been really exhausted, I guess. \n\nToday was alright. Just a pretty normal day until marching band practice. Well, actually...marching band was pretty normal too, but...yeah. We just did the Washington Post, like we do every parade, and then went outside and marched for a bit. Fun stuff, eh? Hmm. Brandon drove me home, and here I am. Heh. \n\nI feel awful, though. I have this joke with my friend. She's incredibly slender, and it's this joke about her being overweight, and complaining about it, and whatnot, but...I didn't think before I put this joking away message on that said how I don't like when people who are slender think they're overweight, but...I really didn't think before I spoke, or...wrote, I guess. So, of course, someone who I really hadn't intended to hurt, or even direct that toward saw it, and...I think she got upset. I was looking at her away message, and she seemed kind of upset, so...I looked at her diary thing, and I saw. I just feel so terrible. I tried calling her, but she's eating dinner. I really need to talk to her and clear this up, because it wasn't about her. Argh. I REALLY need to be more careful of what I say. Heh, this gives me a good example for my speech on how people need to think before they speak, though. \n\nYes, she got online. Phew!",
    "Today was incredibly busy and I have a lot to share, but unfortunately, I'm feeling completely drained and unable to write about it at the moment. I'll make sure to update you tomorrow when I'm feeling more energized. Until then, goodnight!",
    "It's ironic that this situation reminds me of something. The truth is, he's never had the right to do what he's doing. He's never put in the effort to earn that privilege. Despite having plenty of time, he's failed to do so. In fact, it would likely take him twice as long as I've known him to earn the right. I'm aware that no one understands what I'm referring to, and that's probably for the best.",
    "I need some space right now. I'm feeling really upset and frustrated, and I need some time to process my emotions. I don't want to talk to you right now, and I need you to respect my boundaries. I know we'll talk again soon, but for now, please give me some room to breathe. I'm not trying to be mean, but I'm feeling overwhelmed and I need some time to calm down. It's not about hating you, it's just about taking care of myself right now. Can we take a break and revisit this conversation when I'm feeling more centered? I appreciate your understanding.",
    "Today was an okay day. Band was normal, but the auditorium was hot. I was relieved that my Music Theory teacher didn't talk much. In Chemistry, we did a lab, but it was nothing exciting. In Health, we learned about the female reproductive system. There's a girl in my class named Kat who's very brave and asks bold questions. She even shared some personal things that I didn't need to know! Speech class was boring, and I need to change my topic for a persuasive speech. Lunch was normal, and Math had a tough quiz. Government class was fun, but before it, I felt like being quiet and didn't want to talk to anyone. People always get worried when I'm quiet, but I'm just feeling that way sometimes. Now, I'm going to make dinner. Goodbye!",
    "I've been dared to remain silent for an entire day of school, and I'm thrilled to take on the challenge! I'm confident it'll be an amazing experience. The only potential hurdle will be explaining my silence to my classmates and teachers.",
    "I love being quiet, but people always assume something's wrong. 'What's wrong?' 'Are you okay?' They act like being quiet is a sin. Newsflash: it's okay to be quiet! I'm happy, fine, and just want some silence. I'll go enjoy dinner and maybe do something productive. Hehe, peace out.",
    "I'll put on a bright, convincing smile, masking the pain and heartache that's secretly tearing me apart. I'll speak with a tone of unwavering optimism, as if every aspect of my life is utterly flawless and nothing is amiss. I'll move through each day with a carefree air, pretending that the struggles and hardships are just a fleeting, surreal nightmare. And I'll keep up this charade, no matter how much it's killing me on the inside, because I know that someday, the storm will pass, the sun will shine through, and everything will finally be okay.",
    "We come to love not by finding flawlessness, but by embracing the beauty in someone's imperfections.",
    "I'm currently talking to Christy, and it's amazing. I've really been missing her lately. What I appreciate most about Christy is that I can trust her implicitly - it's truly remarkable. In fact, she's one of the most trustworthy people I've ever had in my life, second only to my mom.",
    "I didn't do anything today. I didn't want to spend Saturday night alone, so I didn't end up doing anything. I wish I could drive, it would be a huge freedom for me. I'd be able to go places on my own without relying on others. I'm really looking forward to summer when I can go to Michigan and enjoy the beach. I want to walk alone on the beach at sunset and have some time to myself in a beautiful place. I'm going to go read now. Bye.",
    "I'm on a roll! I just made another change and I'm loving every minute of it. This is exhilarating! But, I have to admit, I'm getting a bit carried away - I'm having way too much fun!",
    "I have acquired a new template, which, although satisfactory, has a particularly noteworthy title: \"Aliens Stole My Wallet.\" I must admit that I find the name quite amusing.",
    "Life is treating me well at the moment. Although I have a hefty amount of homework to tackle, everything else is falling into place. I'm also looking forward to going out later, which is a great way to cap off the weekend. The best part? I won't be spending my Saturday night solo, and that's definitely something to celebrate!",
    "I embarked on a mission to Michaels, determined to score the perfect shirt for my Chemistry project's tie-dye extravaganza! My heart was set on a long-sleeved masterpiece, but alas, it seemed like the universe had other plans. Despite the setback, I refused to let it dampen my spirits. Now, the question on my mind is... what's next? Will I spend the evening conjuring up a plan B, or will I stumble upon a new adventure?",
    "Unravel the Rainbow of Personalities! \n\nGet ready to meet the vibrant cast of characters, each with their own unique hue. \n\nDiane shines bright with Orange, while Derek and Kelly ignite with fiery Red. Matthew and Kristen radiate warmth with Orange, and Joanne spreads sunshine with Yellow. Mary Clare's calming presence is reminiscent of a clear Sky Blue sky. Brett and Emily bring a burst of energy with Blue and Yellow, respectively. Dave's nostalgic charm is captured in Sepia tones, while Bryan shines like a ray of Bright Yellow sunshine. Chris rounds out the Orange crew, and Brandon brings a fresh touch with Green. And last but not least, I'm proud to represent Brown. \n\nI've compiled this colorful list to keep track of the amazing array of personalities that make our group so special. Who's next to join the rainbow?",
    "OMG, I'm still cringing thinking about my childhood self! I was the ULTIMATE loser back in the day! And you know what's even more hilarious? I'm still a little quirky to this day! But hey, at least I've got a good laugh about it now. I mean, who else do you know who was obsessed with alphabetizing their crayons? Yeah, that was me - the crayon-organizing, rule-following, total nerd!",
    "I'm secure enough to enjoy a Friday night in, guilt-free.",
    "If I were a crayon, I'd be brown. I feel a pang of sympathy for the humble brown crayon. It's often overlooked and underappreciated, except by a select few. Despite its utility, the brown crayon is frequently disrespected. We all need it at some point to draw trees, brown hair, or other everyday objects, yet we rarely acknowledge its importance. How often do we stop to think about the brown crayon's versatility? It's a constant presence, always ready to serve, yet it's consistently shunned. I worry that one day, the brown crayon will reach its breaking point from all the rejection, and it will be a tragedy. Children are drawn to the bright, flashy colors like blue, purple, and pink, but it's not just about aesthetics. It's about the value and purpose of the crayon. The brown crayon may not be the most glamorous, but it's a reliable and helpful tool that's always there, even when others reject it. (I guess I get a little philosophical when I'm tired... or just plain weird!)",
    "This week has been going well so far. It's flying by, which is a relief. However, I'm expecting next week to feel slow. I'm not in the mood to write much right now, so I might add more later. For now, I need to go make dinner.",
    "I'm really missing my girl Victoria right now. I miss how she'd always drop everything to come to me whenever I called her name. She'd do anything for me, no questions asked. I miss our snuggle sessions at night, when she'd curl up beside me and keep me company. And I miss how she only had eyes for me - she didn't care about anyone else! Everyone would say, \"Hey Catie, go get Victoria, she only listens to you!\" It was like she had a sixth sense for when I was feeling down, and she'd always find me to give me a cuddle and cheer me up. She was MY cat, and she loved me for who I am, no judgments or conditions. She didn't want to change a single thing about me. I'm really struggling with the fact that she's gone. Finding her lying on the floor, lifeless, was just devastating. I wish she was here with me now, listening to me, crying with me, and snuggling with me. I know thinking about it won't bring her back, but it's hard not to. It feels like a part of me is missing, like I've lost a piece of my heart.",
    "I'm struggling to understand why I seem to be invisible to others when it comes to forming meaningful connections. Despite considering myself a kind and decent person, I've come to realize that I've been consistently overlooked by others, with the exception of Matt. This pattern has left me feeling perplexed and defeated.\n\nI've been reflecting on my relationships and have noticed that while people trust me enough to confide in me, I'm rarely the subject of their conversations or romantic interests. It's as if I'm invisible in the dating world. Everyone around me seems to find someone, and I'm left to hear about their experiences, which only serves as a painful reminder of my own isolation.\n\nI'm starting to wonder if I've been fooling myself about my own worth and likability. Have I been blind to my own flaws or shortcomings that might be driving others away? The feeling of being perpetually overlooked is taking a toll on my self-esteem, leaving me feeling hopeless and uncertain about my ability to form lasting connections. Right now, it feels like the glass is not just half empty, but shattered into a million pieces, leaving me to pick up the shards of my own self-doubt.",
    "I'm feeling overwhelmed and unsure about what to do. My thoughts are jumbled and unclear. Life seems confusing right now. But one thing that brings me joy is thinking of Michigan. Repeating its name in my mind puts a smile on my face.",
    "Angie and I came up with a great analogy: Abstinence is like waiting for a delicious Thanksgiving dinner. You resist the temptation to snack throughout the day because you know the reward will be well worth the wait. It's a great way to think about the benefits of abstinence!",
    "I'm torn between my rational doubts and my emotional desires. While my heart is urging me to take a chance, my head is warning me of the potential risks and consequences. I'm afraid that if I follow my heart, I'll end up hurt and embarrassed.",
    "I'm stuck in a cycle of 'what ifs' and 'maybes', but the truth is, even if I did have feelings for him, I'd probably let fear hold me back from taking a chance. Why do I always let my doubts and fears get the best of me?",
    "While many consider this period to be the most enjoyable, I acknowledge that it also comes with its fair share of challenges and difficulties.",
    "Ugh, I'm exhausted and all I want to do is dive back into my book, but I'm making myself take a minute to jot down some notes so I don't forget... Today was a day, let me tell you. I need to write about cleaning out my locker and the whole after-school adventure that went down. And then there was Tyler... Oh, and how could I forget our trip to see Finding Nemo? But the real highlight was Kathryn's epic outburst at the boys in the car - that was something else!",
    "I'm still shocked by what he did to his first girlfriend.",
    "I'm taken aback by the intensity of my emotions. I'm feeling a deep sense of frustration and hurt. It's like a weight is pressing down on me, and I'm struggling to find the words to express it. I thought we had learned from past mistakes, but it seems like history is repeating itself. The thought of them together is unbearable to me. I need to prioritize my own well-being and take a step back to protect myself from further pain. It's time for me to focus on my own healing and growth.",
    "Ugh, are you kidding me?! You just totally ruined everything! Thanks a million, buddy. I was really counting on things going smoothly, but noooo, you had to come along and mess it all up.",
    "I'm deeply disturbed by the situation. A friend is being drawn into a potentially abusive relationship with someone who has a history of hurting his partners. Despite my concerns, I believe she's ignoring the warning signs and may even be more likely to pursue him if I try to intervene. His charming exterior hides an impulsive nature, which I fear will lead to emotional and possibly physical harm. It's frustrating to know that I'll likely be proven right, but it won't bring me any satisfaction to say 'I told you so' when she gets hurt. He's already had multiple chances to change, but I'm worried she'll fall victim to his patterns. This situation is weighing heavily on my mind, and I'm struggling to shake off the feeling of helplessness. On a separate note, I had a lovely conversation with Joanne tonight, but my concerns for my friend continue to dominate my thoughts.",
    "I just caught myself writing \"my Kelly's\" as if I own them! It's funny, I guess I was feeling a little possessive there for a second!",
    "I'm determined to stay in touch with my close friends, including Kelly, Joanne, Kathryn, and Emily.",
    "I've had an epiphany! When Kelly becomes famous, I'll try to get backstage at her concert. The guards will dismiss me, but Kelly will intervene, saying \"Catie, my love.\" I'll laugh triumphantly in their faces.",
    "Despite its musical shortcomings, this song still resonates with me. It takes me back to those late-night conversations about our futures, when we'd wonder where we'd be at 25. I remember thinking that time would stand still, that our lives would remain unchanged. But we knew that when we left that year behind, we wouldn't be coming back. Our paths would diverge, and our carefree days of hanging out would be a thing of the past.\n\nIf there was something you needed to say, you had to say it then, because time was running out. We were moving forward, and there was no slowing down. Memories of our time together played like a silent film in my mind, especially that June night when love caught me off guard. There was just you and me, lost in our own little world, talking on the phone, getting excited and scared, laughing at life's unfairness.\n\nAs we move on, we remember the good times, the laughter, and the tears. And even as our lives take different turns, we'll remain friends forever. Will we still find humor in our old jokes when we're successful and wealthy? Will we recall the lessons we learned in school, or will we still be trying to break the rules? Will our dreams come true, or will we find new passions?\n\nI keep telling myself it's not goodbye, but a new chapter. As we go on, we'll remember the times we shared, and no matter what life brings, our friendship will endure. Will we look back on our youth with nostalgia, wondering if we can survive the challenges ahead? Only time will tell. But for now, I hold on to the memories, and the promise that our bond will last a lifetime.",
    "I'm feeling a little sentimental today. It's the seniors' last day, and it's got me thinking about how fast time flies. I'm excited to think about the adventures that await me and my friends after high school. Of course, it's bittersweet knowing that we'll be going our separate ways, but I'm grateful for the amazing friendships I've formed.\n\nI'm especially going to miss Chris - we've had some incredible times together, and I love how easy it is to talk to him. But I'm not worried about losing touch; I'm sure we'll find ways to stay in touch, even if we're not in the same place.\n\nI've learned that true friendships can withstand distance and time. Kelly, for instance, is someone I know I'll stay close to no matter what. We've shared so many memories, and I have no doubt we'll continue to support each other throughout our lives.\n\nAs for my other friends, I'm excited to see where life takes them. Kelly C. is going to rock the clarinet world, and I'll be cheering her on from the sidelines. Kathryn and I will make an effort to stay in touch, and I'm sure we'll have plenty of opportunities to catch up. Emily's European adventure is going to be amazing, and I'll be living vicariously through her. And Joanne's English escapade will be an incredible experience for her.\n\nI'm grateful for the friends I've made and the memories we've shared. Change can be scary, but it's also an opportunity for growth and new experiences. I'm choosing to focus on the excitement of what's to come, rather than getting bogged down in sadness.\n\nSo, let's raise a glass to new beginnings and the incredible friendships that will continue to enrich our lives!",
    "Honestly, the thought that sends shivers down my spine is that it's totally plausible! And you know what's even more hilarious? When I'm chatting away and everyone around me is like, 'Huh?' - it's like, my own personal comedy show!",
    "I'm trying to distract myself from thinking about my cat, because if I let myself dwell on it, I'll get emotional and tear up. I've been able to suppress the feelings and keep them in the back of my mind, and that's where I intend to keep them for now.",
    "It's frustrating when the only person who shows interest in me is someone I genuinely can't stand. I'm stuck with the fact that he's the only one who'll ever appreciate me, yet I can't bring myself to reciprocate his feelings. It's just my luck!",
    "I'll wear a brave face, flashing a radiant smile that defies the turmoil within. My words will be laced with conviction, painting a picture of perfection. I'll dance through the darkness, convincing myself it's all just a fleeting nightmare. And I'll pretend the pain doesn't exist, because I know that one day, the storm will pass, and the sun will shine bright - everything will be okay, and I'll emerge stronger, wiser, and free.",
    "Lately, I've found myself writing more frequently in this journal. I'm not sure what's driving this urge, but it's got me puzzled. Despite feeling happy on the surface, I'm also struggling with a sense of sadness. It's as if I'm missing a crucial piece of the puzzle, and it's frustratingly just out of reach. I feel like there's something obvious staring me right in the face, but I just can't seem to grasp it. I'm left feeling uncertain and unsure, with more questions than answers.",

    "\"Unearthing a Treasure from the Past: A Heartfelt Reflection on Faith and Love\"\n\nAs I delved into the archives of my blog, I stumbled upon a gem that made my heart skip a beat. It's a poignant reminder that I just can't keep to myself. The words that resonated deeply with me are from 1 Corinthians 13:4-8: \"Love is patient, love is kind... Love never fails.\"\n\nThese powerful verses are a testament to the transformative power of love and faith. As I reflect on my journey, I'm struck by how much I've grown and evolved. My faith has been a constant source of comfort and strength, and I'm grateful for the quiet, personal connection I share with God.\n\nIt's ironic that some people might assume I'm not a person of faith, but the truth is, I'm deeply devoted. I just prefer to express my spirituality in my own way, without imposing my beliefs on others. It's the respectful, gentle approach that resonates with me.\n\nWhat bothers me is when people try to force their views on others, often with harmful consequences. Wars fought in the name of God are a stark reminder of the destructive power of intolerance. Don't we realize that we're going against the very principles of love and compassion that our faith teaches us?\n\nCan't we just let people believe what they want to believe? The beauty of faith lies in its diversity, and it's time we celebrated our differences rather than trying to eradicate them.\n\nSorry, I guess I needed to vent a little. But I hope this reflection inspires you to embrace love, kindness, and acceptance – the true essence of faith.",
    "I recently discovered an amazing song that Katharine and Diane are both huge fans of, and I have to say, I'm really enjoying it too. The lyrics are particularly striking: \"The strands in your eyes, the color them wonderful... Stop me, steal my breath... Emeralds from mountains thrust towards the sky, never revealing their depth... Tell me that we belong together...\"",

    "I'm feeling completely overwhelmed and stressed out right now. I'm so frustrated with this person who always seems to find ways to annoy me. It's like they intentionally try to push my buttons. I'm not in the right mindset to talk to anyone, and I'm worried I might say something I'll regret. I'm feeling really down, lonely, and isolated, even though I know I have great friends. I just want to be left alone tomorrow at school and only interact with a few close friends. I'm really missing my friend Amanda who moved away and wish I could see her. I'm also hoping to reconnect with Heather over the summer if she's made some positive changes. I'm struggling to focus on the present moment and keep getting caught up in worries about tomorrow. I had a weird dream recently that I'm still trying to make sense of. All I want to do is get this speech task done so I can relax and unwind with a good book and some sleep. I just wish someone could help me figure out what's going on with me and why I'm feeling this way.",

It's essential for me to hold onto these dreams, even if they're just a distant possibility. They bring me comfort and solace. Right now, I need my own company, and that's enough.",
    "I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed and need some solo time. When I'm in this headspace, even the smallest things can get under my skin. I think it's best if I take a step back, focus on my priorities, and work on perfecting my speech. Tonight's not the night for socializing - I need to prioritize my own emotional well-being. Maybe I'm just feeling a bit under the weather, but either way, I'm going to channel my energy into getting this speech just right.",
    "I'm relieved that something finally worked out after a frustrating experience. Unfortunately, I'm not feeling well and have a stomachache. Today was an okay day, with only 4 more days of classes left. I made progress on my speech outline at the writing center, but music theory was a struggle. Chemistry was confusing, and Health was boring. Speech was okay, and I'm glad I didn't have to give my speech. Lunch and math were uneventful, and Government class was spent watching a movie. It's been a dull day, so I'm going to work on my speech, eat dinner, read, and then get some rest.",
    "Good morning! I'm really hoping today goes smoothly and that I don't have to give my speech, especially if Mr. A is present. It just occurred to me that if Alstadt were to somehow read this, it would be disastrous - I'd either never make it into WE or feel awful, probably both! Maybe I should avoid mentioning him in here, but it's hard since he often frustrates me. I'll try to limit my comments about him, though. Anyway, off to school I go! Not exactly thrilled, but...bye for now!",
    "I'm utterly appalled and disturbed by the horrific images I've encountered. The sheer audacity and graphic nature of these visuals has left me reeling in disgust. I'm literally on the verge of nausea, and I implore you to take immediate action to address this egregious issue. The very thought of these disturbing images is an affront to decency and morality. We must take a stand against such explicit content and demand a higher standard of respect and responsibility.",

    "I'm beyond thrilled to announce that I've finally completed my music theory composition! The sense of accomplishment is exhilarating! Crossing this off my to-do list feels amazing! As for that phone call I was supposed to make to a certain someone... let's just say I chickened out. But the silver lining? I had an awesome conversation with a really cool person instead! All in all, it's been a pretty fantastic Sunday evening!",
    "I never realized how rarely I mention my dad. Tonight, I had a conversation with someone who asked about his whereabouts, as if he were no longer around. It was kind of amusing. My dad is a great guy, and I get along well with him, as well as the rest of my family. They're all very cool. While I don't discuss personal matters with my dad like I do with my mom, we still have a good relationship. Anyway, I need to quickly gather some research for my final speech and then head to bed - I'm exhausted! Goodnight.",
    "Today's Agenda:\n\n* Harmonize my music theory composition\n* Craft a compelling final speech, complete with a detailed outline\n* Take a refreshing break to shoot some hoops\n* Indulge in a sweet treat: a cookie paired with a cold glass of milk\n* Reach out to a special someone (wishful thinking, perhaps?)\n* Come to terms with the fact that summer is still on the horizon\n* Treat myself to some new earrings\n* Avoid procrastination by closing this blog and tackling my tasks head-on!\n\nAs I reflect on everything, I'm reminded that life is truly wonderful. More to come later...",
    "The utterance of unbridled frustration echoes through the realm, a cacophony of despair that shatters the tranquility of the atmosphere! \"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\" - a primal scream that pierces the eardrums, a visceral expression of the depths of my detestation. For I abhor homework with an intensity that rivals the ferocity of a thousand blazing stars, their fiery passion igniting a maelstrom of discontent within my very being. The mere mention of the word is enough to summon a torrent of indignation, a deluge of disdain that threatens to consume my every waking thought.",
    "I'm really struggling to motivate myself to do my homework. I'm currently working on a music theory assignment, and to be honest, I'm not enjoying it at all. In fact, I have a strong dislike for music theory. I'm starting to regret taking the class, as I don't feel like I fit in and I'm not very good at writing music or understanding music concepts in general.\n\nTo make matters worse, I'm getting increasingly frustrated with someone who seems to know exactly how to push my buttons. Even small things they do are annoying me, and I'm finding it harder and harder to keep my cool. It's like they're intentionally trying to get under my skin.\n\nI think I've had enough for now. I'm going to take a break and step away from this situation. It's not doing me any good to get worked up over it.",
    "The power of girl time! Just 90 minutes with my favorite ladies and suddenly, everything becomes crystal clear. Tonight, I escaped to Kathryn's house, where we indulged in some much-needed gossip, laughter, and relaxation. It was the perfect remedy for a chaotic week. Okay, so Kelly was MIA, but we didn't let that dampen our spirits. We still had an absolute blast. And the cherry on top? I got to take the wheel and drive myself home - pure freedom! As I'm writing this, my eyelids are getting heavier by the minute, so I'm off to bed... unless, of course, AIM has other plans for me. Let's be real, I'm hopelessly addicted to those instant messages!",
    "I can finally stop pretending to clean! I have to admit, I'm terrified of bugs. I saw a harmless little ant approaching me and I totally freaked out. I grabbed some Fantastik and, well, let's just say the ant didn't survive. Now I feel awful about it, but honestly, anything with more than four legs really unsettles me. It just doesn't seem natural. Centipedes, in particular, give me the chills. I'd rather not think about it anymore. On a more positive note, I'm excited to head to Kathryn's tonight! I should probably get dinner and get ready to go. Overall, I'm feeling pretty content right now.",
    "I'm really excited to go to Michigan, but I'm not sure why. I've been talking to Lauren about partying and having fun, and I really want to let loose. However, I've promised myself I wouldn't drink or do drugs. I'm not sure why I made that promise, but I want to have fun and be included with others. I've been invited to hang out with Pat and his friends, but I didn't go last time because I knew they'd be drinking and doing drugs. This time, I might hang out with Conor instead, since he doesn't drink. I've also asked Max to bring a non-drinking friend. Lauren and I had a funny conversation about partying, and I'm looking forward to getting back at the guys with a good prank. We're also planning to pick up some \"yokels\" (country people) which should be entertaining.",

Let's keep the humor light-hearted and harmless!",
    "WOOHOOOOOOOOOO! I've officially entered the realm of the utterly absurd! Forget substances, folks, the ultimate high comes from surviving on fumes and defying the sleep gods! The thrill of the late-night rush is unbeatable! HAHAHAHAHAHAHA! Sweet dreams, or should I say, sweet delirium!",
    "I am uncertain about my identity and sense of self. It may take a considerable amount of time to discover my true nature, as well as to find you. I do not require a response from you; I simply need you to acknowledge my perspective. It is time for us to dismantle the barriers that we have erected between us.\n\nAm I still capable of feeling emotions, or have I lost that sensitivity? Am I fragile, as you seem to perceive me? I am unclear about my identity, and you are the only one who recognizes this uncertainty. I am unable to pose questions that cannot be answered at present. Even if our relationship falters and we begin to drift apart, I will understand your position, and I will come to terms with this on my own.\n\nI do not need to hear your response; I merely need you to empathize with me. It is essential that we transcend our boundaries. Considering how far we have come, is it too late to discard our past? Will you be waiting for me? I must inquire about the nature of our relationship, but if I ask today, it may not be sustainable. Therefore, I will wait for you.\n\nWill we ever experience this level of connection again? Not today. Will we ever feel this genuine again? Not today. Will you ever belong to me again? Not today. Will we ever feel this genuine again? Not today.\n\nIt is unfortunate that the world can be so cruel and that people can be so unkind.",
    "I had a very good and interesting day, but I've decided not to write about it here.",
    "I just found out someone else reads this, so I need to be more careful what I write. Luckily, I can still write about Ryan since he never reads this. I'm worried about tomorrow - I was supposed to hang out with him, but I'm having second thoughts. I don't want to start liking him again because it didn't work out last time. I'm torn between being a good friend and avoiding another painful relationship. Tonight was fun, though - I went to Peter's party and hung out with Chris afterwards. I'm just really anxious about tomorrow and hope I make the right decision.",
    "I slept in and aced my government final without studying! Then, I met up with friends for lunch at Einsteins (after two other restaurants were too full). We went paddle boating, had fun at Starbucks, and hung out at Joanne's, doing karaoke and playing spoons (with forks!). I cut myself, but an Elmo bandaid made me feel better. Tonight, I'm going to Peter's party, and tomorrow I'm hanging out with Ryan all day. No school tomorrow, yay!",
    "Ugh, today was a total snooze-fest. I'm not even motivated to write about it. Oh well, at least tomorrow is looking up!",
    "I had a great day today, despite initially dreading it because of my unpleasant encounter with Mr. Alstadt. However, it turned out to be one of my easiest days. I started the day by sitting in the band room before school, which was unexpectedly open. Then, I took my speech final, which was easy, and I got a B without studying. I'm still on track to get an A in the class.\n\nAfter the final, I went to band, but since we had already taken our final on Friday, there was nothing to do. To avoid sorting commencement music, Kelly and I decided to take a break and walk to Burger King to grab some food. We got kids' meals and even got toys with them! We walked back to school without getting caught.\n\nLater, we had to attend music theory class, which wasn't as bad as I thought. I was able to prove Mr. Alstadt wrong about a music composition, which was a small victory. With our kids' meals, we also got scratch-and-sniff stickers, one of which smelled terrible.\n\nOverall, it was a great day, and I'm glad I was able to overcome my initial anxiety about seeing Mr. Alstadt. Now, I think I'll do something productive with my time.",
    "Today was a rollercoaster of emotions. I woke up late, around 10 am, and my day got off to a rocky start when I couldn't find my shoes anywhere. After searching the entire house, I finally tracked them down. Feeling relieved, I headed to take a shower, thinking everything was back on track. But, as I was getting ready, I discovered a rip in my dress! I was frustrated, but luckily, my mom was able to fix it quickly, and I made it to my destination on time.\n\nThe outdoor commencement ceremony was a surprise, and the weather didn't cooperate. The seniors didn't get to escape the rain, but we were lucky enough to head inside after our performance. My music, hair, dress, and shoes all got soaked, but I tried not to let it dampen my spirits.\n\nAfter the ceremony, I got a ride home from Chris and changed into some dry clothes. We met up with Brandon and Bryan at Chipotle, and I finally got to try their food – it was delicious! I couldn't finish my meal, but it was worth it. Next, we headed to Coldstone, where I indulged in chocolate ice cream with gummy bears. Yum!\n\nChris and I took a drive and chatted for a bit before I headed home to study for my math test. However, I found myself struggling to focus, so I decided to write instead. It's funny how sometimes friends worry about sharing their thoughts with you, fearing you'll be upset. But when they finally open up, you realize you're not mad at all, and it only makes you appreciate their honesty and trust even more. It's a great feeling to know someone trusts you that much.\n\nThat's my eventful day in a nutshell. I'm sure it's all a bit confusing, but that's okay. I'm off to \"study\" now – or maybe not!",

    "Ugh, being the only single one in the room? It's literally the best feeling in the world... said no one ever! Let's be real, it's a total drag. I'm just over here pretending to be okay with flying solo, but honestly, it's a lonely and frustrating feeling.",
    "I refuse to let this setback discourage me and hinder my progress. I'm determined to stay positive and motivated, no matter what obstacles come my way.",
    "I'm feeling really down and frustrated. Tonight's Pizza Hut outing with friends didn't live up to my expectations. I'm struggling to have fun because of my bad mood. I feel like I'm wasting my summer and it's making me angry and sad. Hopefully, things will improve tomorrow.",
    "Everyone left for Germany, but I've been keeping busy and having a blast! I've been hanging out with friends, writing to Chris and Kelly, and enjoying the pool without getting burned (mostly!). I had a sleepover at Joanne's, where we watched The Princess Bride for the first time - it's amazing! Joanne's curiosity was hilarious when she didn't know something. Today, I've been cleaning and getting ready for a night out with Katharine, Diane, and maybe Steve and Jeff. Should be exciting! Got to run, lots to do!",
    "I have serious doubts that this will ever come to fruition.",
    "Today was a decent day. The highlight was giving my dad his gifts, which was a lot of fun. Other than that, I didn't do much except get hooked on the computer game Civilization - it's seriously addictive! Tomorrow is going to be tough, though. Everyone's leaving, and I'll really miss my close friends, especially Kelly and Chris. I'm not sure they'll feel the same way about me, but that's okay. On a more mundane note, I spent some time cleaning my bathroom, which I absolutely hate doing. I dream of being rich one day so I can hire someone to do it for me, or maybe I'll find a partner who enjoys cleaning (yeah, right!). Anyway, I'm looking forward to catching up with Kelly soon. I'll try to write more later.",
    "I've been noticing a shift in my feelings towards him lately. Instead of letting frustration build up, I'm taking this as an opportunity to reflect on what's not working for me in our interactions. It's clear that we have different communication styles, and that's causing tension. Rather than getting angry, I'm going to focus on finding ways to navigate our conversations more effectively. It's time for me to set boundaries and prioritize my own emotional well-being.",
    "I recently looked back at my first blog post, which isn't on this page, and I was struck by how awkward it was. It's a bit embarrassing, to be honest. I wonder if I'll feel the same way about my current writing in seven months. I'm surprised I've been able to maintain this blog, as I've never been able to keep a traditional diary. I used to think writing in a diary was just complaining on paper, but somehow writing on a computer screen feels different. I'm not sure how much longer I'll keep writing, but I don't plan on stopping anytime soon. These are interesting thoughts, but I'm not in a reflective mood right now, so I think I'll go read a book and wait for a stormy day to come.",
    "Weird weather today - rain, sun, and now clouds. I love storms, as long as they're not deadly. I enjoy reading during them, all snuggled up with my blanket and stuffed animals. Time has flown by, and I'm excited for my family to come home on Monday. I've had a blast meeting new people and hanging out with friends. Only 13 days until Michigan, and I just found out we're likely going to Italy for Thanksgiving! I'm thrilled, especially if we get to fly first class. I love Rome, but I might miss it if the marching band goes to the Macy's Day parade. Anyway, my house is too quiet, so I'm going to go check it out - it's making me nervous.",
    "I had an amusing conversation tonight when someone asked if I'm a frequent crier. The irony is that I rarely shed tears, unless it's something that deeply resonates with me or I've been bottling up emotions. Occasionally, a beautiful song can evoke strong feelings and bring me to tears. Music has a profound impact on me, uncovering emotions I didn't know I possessed. While I don't aspire to pursue a career in music, I'm grateful it's a part of my life and I have immense respect for talented musicians. Anyway, time for bed - for real this time!",

    "I'm experiencing a rare phenomenon - I'm not feeling fatigued, and for once, I'm not inclined to indulge in reading. It's peculiar, considering I woke up at a reasonable hour today. Perhaps I should redirect my attention from this journal and engage in conversation with my friends instead. I was simultaneously chatting with five acquaintances, and our conversations all concluded at the same time. How intriguing. Katharine has suggested that I retire for the night, and I must admit, it's sage advice. My friends often offer valuable insights, particularly when it comes to getting adequate rest.\n\nI've recently learned that Chris, Mike, and both Daves were indulging in alcohol in Germany. While it doesn't exactly perturb me, it does evoke a sense of disappointment. I'm surprised, especially considering one of the Daves had previously assured me that he abstains from drinking. I recall our conversation vividly, as his response seemed almost offended, as if I had impugned his character by asking the question. Ah, well, it's their prerogative, not mine. They're free to make their own choices, but I must admit that my respect for Dave has diminished slightly.\n\nI'm off to converse with some fascinating individuals, simply because they're delightful company. I'm pleased to report that I've completed my current book, which is a satisfying accomplishment. Now, I'll need to find a new literary pursuit. Until next time, I bid adieu, feeling content and cheerful.",
    "I'm hesitant about taking a particular course of action, and I'm likely to opt out. I'm feeling anxious and indecisive, much like the phrase 'a chicken with its head cut off' suggests. This phrase always reminds me of the fascinating story of Mike, the chicken who lived for 18 months after his head was partially severed in 1945. While I find it disturbing that someone would perform such an act, I'm also intrigued by the scientific phenomenon that allowed Mike to survive for so long. I'd love to learn more about the biology and physiology behind this remarkable case.",
    "As creatives, we all have our unique ways of sparking inspiration and clarity. For me, it's heading to the park and swinging on the swings while listening to music. It may seem unconventional, but it's my go-to spot for reflection and idea generation. The gentle motion and fresh air help me process my thoughts and quiet my mind. I've come to realize that it's not about what others think; it's about finding what works for me. So, whether you're a fellow swing-lover or have your own secret spot, remember that it's okay to be different. Embrace your quirks and find what fuels your creativity – even if it means swinging into your own rhythm.",

All I can think about is this moment with you. I don't want to miss you tonight.\n\nI don't want others to see me because they won't understand. Everything in life is temporary, but I want you to know the real me. I don't want to hide my true feelings or pretend to be someone I'm not. I just want you to know who I really am.\n\nI repeat this because it's how I truly feel. I want you to understand me, and I want to be myself around you.",
    "You're teetering on the edge, one misstep away from disaster. Perhaps you're contemplating a leap of faith, but uncertainty grips your heart.

But don't let tomorrow's uncertainty hold you back from seizing today's opportunities. Remember, procrastination can lead to devastating consequences.\n\n\"If I'm just a disappointment, a waste of your dreams, I'll own up to my failures. If my presence only serves to witness your suffering, I'll acknowledge my shortcomings. You're walking a thin line, waiting for your turn to fall, but you're too far gone to see the outstretched hands ready to catch you.\n\n\"Don't let fear and doubt define your heart. You were meant to soar, not crawl. And when you have nothing, it's always too late to make a change.\n\n\"I know I'm not perfect, but I promise to stand by you. I won't abandon you or let you down. Let's forge our own path, making it up as we go along. We'll leave the broken promises and shattered dreams behind. I'll be your rock, your safe haven, your forever companion.\"\n\nAnd here's a rephrased version of the personal quote:\n\n\"This song has been my anthem for years, and its powerful lyrics continue to resonate with me.

But no, my mind goes into overdrive, and I'm stuck in a vortex of anxiety.\n\nRight now, I'm desperate to talk to Kelly or Chris, but they're not here, and I'm forced to wait for what feels like an eternity for their response to my email. The hours are crawling by at a snail's pace. Can Monday just get here already?!\n\nI'm frustrated, I'm anxious, and I'm fed up with feeling this way.

But hey, all I can do is appreciate what I've got right now and hope it keeps going. \n\nOn a totally different note, have you ever noticed how weird you can get at night? Like, I turn into a total goofball. I'm pretty sure it's got something to do with the way our brains work late at night. I should really look into that. And, let me tell you, gummy bears at 2:22 in the morning? Absolutely delicious!",
    "I didn't get any rest, but it's of little consequence now. I've come to accept it. I've decided against attending Joanne's gathering tomorrow, and I'm not bothered by it. We will eventually get around to watching the film; I'm resolute about it. In fact, we've scheduled a viewing for July 9th. It may take some time, but it will happen. I'm currently engaged in a conversation with a young individual who appears to be quite affable. I'll refrain from elaborating further. I'll continue to socialize and perhaps read a book later, as I'm not feeling particularly fatigued.",
    "I've come to a realization - I'm not leaning towards either option. Both are out of the running. It's funny, I'm right back where I started. Frustrating, to say the least. My computer seems to be against me too. But what doesn't, right? On a more positive note, I enjoyed my grilled cheese earlier - it was delicious. Tonight, I'm looking forward to chicken parmesan. I'm not even going to worry about the spelling of that one. Anyway, I think I'll take my lack of productivity elsewhere, rather than cluttering up my blog with it.",
    "I was supposed to visit Joanne, but she had to cancel because she's still working on her mom's closet. That's okay, I'm not feeling my best today anyway. It's just one of those lazy days where all I want to do is make myself a grilled cheese sandwich and indulge in some reading or TV time. I'm a bit addicted to grilled cheese, I must admit! I know I should work on my sleep schedule, but it's hard to stick to it, especially when I'll be in Michigan soon and my routine will change again. I'm in a quirky mood today, and I just tossed my hair tie across the room - yeah, I'm feeling a bit weird. There's not much to talk about, but I did learn something new that might be helpful. Maybe I'll just put everything on hold until college. Who knows, maybe I'll meet some mature guys there! Joanne's lucky to have found someone special, and I'm happy for them both. They're one of those high school couples that might just make it in the long run. Anyway, I'm off to make my grilled cheese and enjoy some downtime.",
    "I've stumbled upon a realization. It seems that guys are drawn to girls who possess an air of mystery, a quick wit, or an intriguing personality. Meanwhile, I'm still trying to figure out where I fit into this puzzle. The thought of conforming to these expectations is unsettling, yet the frustration lingers. Only 16 days until I can escape the confines of Naperville and indulge in some much-needed relaxation. I'm counting down the hours until I can feel the rush of adrenaline on the jetski, the thrill of tubing, and the serenity of lounging in the hammock with a good book. *Sigh* July 11th, why must you taunt me with your slow approach? Ah, well, patience is a virtue, I suppose. Off to dreamland now. Nighty night.",
    "I'm relieved that this thing finally works, and I can jot down a few thoughts about my night before getting some much-needed sleep. Tomorrow, I'm meeting Joanne at 1:00, so I need to prioritize rest. Tonight was decent, despite initial plans with Erica, Brett, and Roger falling through. Instead, I ended up at Joanne's, where we watched the first Harry Potter movie. However, Kathryn inadvertently spoiled part of the fifth book for me, which was frustrating. I think she did it on purpose, judging by her tone and timing. Kelly and I were understandably upset, but we made the most of the evening.\n\nThe good news is that everything with Diane is back on track, and I'm thrilled about it. Lately, it seems like everyone's been on edge, and we all need a break from each other. It's an odd feeling, like we're all craving some space.\n\nI wish my mom were here to talk to about a difficult decision I'm facing. It's hard to confide in people, especially when it involves those I care about. I'm considering making a pros and cons list, but it feels too methodical. I wish I could just trust my instincts and know what's right.\n\nFor now, I think I just need some rest. I was feeling a bit loopy earlier, but getting into a deeper conversation helped me focus. I love being able to be goofy and carefree, without worrying about what others think.\n\nI'm off to bed soon, maybe with a few pages of my book to unwind. Not Harry Potter, though! Goodnight for now!",
    "I lost my blog post because Blogger failed to publish it.",
    "Ugh, I'm torn! Every time I think I've made up my mind after talking to one person, a conversation with the other leaves me questioning everything all over again. Why do choices have to be so ridiculously hard?!",
    "My heart aches with every passing moment without my beloved cat by my side. I'm consumed by an overwhelming sense of longing, yearning for the comfort of her gentle purrs and soft fur. If only she were here, I know she'd be curled up beside me, listening intently as I pour out my thoughts and secrets to her. Her absence feels like a void that can't be filled, leaving me with a deep sadness that only her presence can soothe.",
    "Today, I went out with my mom and had a blast! I finally found the furniture set I've been eyeing, but there's a catch - it doesn't come with the bed I want. Despite that, I love the set, so I'm thinking of buying it and getting an unfinished bed to paint or finish in a matching color.\n\nI'm planning to go out again soon, and I'm debating whether to dress up or stick with my trusty comfy pants. They always put me in a good mood!\n\nIt's hard to believe it's only been 12 days since summer started. It feels like it's been much longer! But I'm excited for what's to come, especially my upcoming trip to Michigan. I get to see friends and family I don't often see, and I'm looking forward to reading Harry Potter during my downtime. I just can't wait!\n\nOh, and I'm having some issues with posting this, but I'm sure it'll work out eventually. Blogger can be a bit quirky sometimes!",
    "I regret my behavior and hope Diane can forgive me. Despite having a good time with her, I was in a bad mood and unfairly took it out on her. I had even suggested we visit Great America together this summer, showing my initial enthusiasm. I feel remorseful about my actions and plan to apologize sincerely, explaining that my bad mood was the issue, not her. I believe she may understand, as everyone has bad days, and I hope she can accept my apology.",
    "Whoops, looks like Diane thinks I'm upset with her because of our Pizza Hut adventure! But the truth is, I was just having a tough day beforehand and it was hard for me to shake it off. That being said, I'm so grateful she invited me out - it was definitely the highlight of my day! I'll give her a call and apologize for bringing her down. I'm really looking forward to chatting with her and clearing the air. I know she'll understand, and we'll move forward with a big ol' smile!",
    "Diane thinks I'm upset with her because of our outing to Pizza Hut, but that's not the case. I was already in a terrible mood before we even got there, which made it hard for me to enjoy myself. I didn't mean to ruin the experience for her, and I'm grateful she invited me in the first place. I'll reach out to her later, apologize, and hope she understands. It was a low point in my day, but her invitation was a bright spot.",
    "Hey there! \n\nSo, I just found out that my Chinese symbol is SPIRIT! Check it out and find yours: urlLink. \n\nAnd, fun fact: I've got a kiss that's totally mesmerizing! My partner is always left feeling like they're in a dream. Want to know what kind of kiss you are? urlLink.\n\nAnyway, I'm gonna go catch up with some people real quick. I know, I know, they're not even my friends... but a social butterfly's gotta do what a social butterfly's gotta do!",
    "It's ironic that I got a high trust score because I don't usually trust many people. These quizzes are really enjoyable...I think I'll take some more!",
    "You embody... innocence. So pure and optimistic, you can be quite reserved at times, but it's only because you're still finding your footing. You radiate a sense of vulnerability, as if you're seeking guidance. Remember that not everyone has your best interests at heart. Being overly trusting can leave you open to exploitation. \n\nWhat feeling do you represent?\n\nbrought to you by [urlLink] Quizilla",
    "I just realized I went to bed at a reasonable hour last night, which is quite remarkable!",
    "Ugh, I'm stuck in party planning purgatory! When my parents decide to throw a bash, I'm roped into doing all the behind-the-scenes grunt work - scrubbing, sautéing, and sweating it out in the kitchen. But the worst part? I'm invisible to the guests. I'm just a ghostly host, toiling away while everyone else has all the fun. It's like, can't I just enjoy the party too?"
