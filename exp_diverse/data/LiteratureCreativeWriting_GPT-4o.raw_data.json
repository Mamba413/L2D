    "\"I won't have time to explain all of this to them.\" Start or end your story with this sentence. I won't have the time to explain all of this to them. They have to die. Sure they don't know it yet, but they'll realize soon, and soon is a time well before never. They'll ask why, question the rationale, wonder under what circumstances did they come to occupy their position. Death, the unwanted companion of life, is never without her share of questions.   But these would be different. There's no mistaking what happened before to what will. It used to be that in a moment a city could disappear under a cloud of ash, but nowadays one would expect no less from the great powers than total annihilation not by fell swoops of display, but by careful attrition of the enemy until their very essence is destroyed by the slow grinding of endless war. It embeds itself within them, becoming a part of their psyche, their identity, until their old selves are left for dead in a world where such knowledge has no use. It is a new world, and this new world needs new people.   Such it is that they the beholden in pacificity must be left to die in their own, lonely sheep in a world now concerned with far more pressing matters. They won't know why, those of old thought never do. Explain to them the needs of war and from them comes nothing but rebuttal and counterpoint. For them the short is sweet, failing to see the beauty in war unceasing. They will never understand the new world as they are. Their option therefore, is to die, or walk amongst the dead.",
    "[ CW ] Write about a song. Each sentence must start with the next letter in the song title. *\" [ Sally ] (https: //www.youtube.com/watch? v=6QyVil0dwhk), come on! Time to go! \"*   Of course, she didn't need to be told that- she knew this moment had been a long time coming. Perhaps too long. Children see things that we as adults don't, and Sally had seen this coming for months, maybe even years.   Rows, late at night, when they thought she was asleep. Yelling loud enough to shake the fixtures and rattle the walls. It was inevitable that sooner or later this day would arrive, the day when her life would be packed up and she'd be driven to some distant city- it was surprising it had taken this long.   Now that day had arrived, and she sat on her bed, looking at the bare walls. Gone were the posters and the pictures that made the room hers. Yesterday, they'd stripped the whole room- her toys, clothes, games, her whole life packed into a van because mummy and daddy could no longer stand to be in the same room, or even the same city.   Oxford would never be a home like Maidstone. Uprooted from her school and torn away from her friends, from the life she knew, the people she loved and trusted- gone, forever. Replaced with uncertainty- unfamiliar faces and unknown streets.   *\" Hey, hey, what's all this? \"*   Evidently she'd taken too long, sitting on her bed, as the tears rolled down her face. All through the divorce, she'd been detached and distant, trying not to let it affect her, but now that the inevitable moment had arrived, it had all become too much to take.   *\" Rugrat, come here.... it'll be alright. \"*   That special nickname her father had given her put a flicker of a smile on her face, despite her tears, as he pulled in for the kind of hug she knew she'd miss the most.   *\" One day, you'll understand- you'll look back and realise this was what's best for everyone- for mummy, for you, and for me. Understand that I love you, and so does mummy, and that no matter if you're in Oxford or in Maidstone or on the moon, that doesn't change one little bit. There's a whole world of opportunity and possibility out there, Sally, and whatever you do, wherever you go, we'll always be right there with you. \"*",
    "[ EU ] You live in Skyrim. It is your job to keep lit all the candles in the abandoned caves and dungeons and castles. Light is a marvelous thing. It alone can turn a dead and inhospitable cave and make it come alive, welcoming as a humble abode. Without it, even the most luxurious palace becomes cold and depressing. Baldin knew this well. The Old Kingdom was rich with forgotten knowledge and artifacts, hidden in old ruins and abandoned temples. But who would venture foolishly into darkness to try and pry this wealth of information without a guiding light?   Baldin liked to keep to himself, watching people from afar. At night, a single candle can function like a beacon, drawing adventurers from all over the land, like moths to a flame. And Baldin wasn't gon na let a lack of light keep them from going. Adventurers love exploring, making their own path and discovering new things. But they don't see the invisible hand that led them there. Adventurers go where Baldin wants them to go.   But even though the caves and ruins may be old and forgotten, they are not entirely deserted. Many traps await the unobservant explorer, and these are no good places to injured, especially considering that the dwellers one might stumble upon can be quite threatening. But for the courageous such tremendous awards awaits; Dwarven metals, Dremoran trinkets, Daedric armors and so much more. Skyrim have some mighty fine adventurers.   And all this thanks to light. Once an adventurer has conquered one of these dungeons and heads back home, they follow the lights blindly, even if they have moved. Or they might go and find that the candles are no more. Baldin likes to play little tricks and have fun with his guests. Baldin has found that most of his guests can't go more than a few days without light. If they don't find their way out they often they go stark mad, resorting to bashing their skulls against rocks or throwing themselves of a cliff. Or they try to sleep. Leaving all that loot for Baldin.   Light is a marvelous thing.",
    "\"Some days, I think I am dying. Other days, I hope I am...\" Some days, I think I am dying. Other days, I hope I am.   But I'm here.   Unfortunately, I am still here.   A shell of a human being. A painting of modest beauty but exquisite detail. Inside, however, lies a drawing soaked in black ink and torn to shreds. There's no beauty in such a world anymore. Just emptiness. Days upon days of gut wrentching emptiness and the sharp teeth of loneliness tearing away at your heels.   > Torment; noun  1. Severe physical or mental suffering   And then you're presented with it. An escape. The smallest glint of light. You can practically feel the relief, the though of it making you happier than anything perhaps ever has. Your whole body tingles at the idea, fear and excitement clouding your desperate mind.   If you had a cavity, you would want a dentist to remove it, would you not? It's been bothering you for weeks now, your teeth in more pain than they've ever been before. You can't eat you favorite things, you can't do any sports, you can hardly talk its so incredibly sore. The only thing on your mind is the pain. The constant never ending pain. How are you supposed to focus on anything with your jaw throbbing like this? It's impossible.   But lucky you, there's a solution. A silver dentist with a loud booming voice, promising you to completely rid yourself of your nasty toothache. *By god*, you'll think, *this has gone on too long. But is this going to hurt? *   \"Not a bit,\" The dentist reassures you with his smoky breathe, extending his metal hand, \"It's quick and easy, you wont feel a thing.\"   \"Yes sir, but what if I feel nothing at all?\"   \"Than at least its better than what you felt before.\"   I nod and give his rigid hand a hard tug.",
    "\"On your right, you'll see natives living along the beach, and they are NOT happy with us being in their sacred waters.\" \"On your right, you'll see the natives living along the beach, and they are NOT happy with us being in their sacred waters.\" Marcus muttered into an imaginary microphone as we floated on our shamble of a armored rubber raft, now riddled with darts and primitive arrows.   The emergency escape pod suffered severe damage on the drop down to planet side. The light weight and heat resistant alloys made for makeshift armor for ourselves and our rubber survival raft. Our only hope was to get out of the territory of these natives and get to the Federation outpost downriver.   The ape-like primitives were much akin to gorillas from earth in terms of survival habits. Building \"nests\" in trees, which were more like tree houses that any kid would want, and not being able to swim and just not liking water in general, getting most of their hydration from native plants and fruits.   I was to be conducting studies of the primitives, to see if they were viable to learn, be educated, and introduced to the galactic stage. It was doubtful, as my 2 years spent observing them from the Federation Cruiser, the *Iaculum*, proved they they were essentially at their peak of civilization. My colleague had much less respect for said natives however, making constant jokes of giving the peace presents of bananas.   The natives walked the shore, matching the pace of our boat in the current, some carrying spiked clubs made from the tails of some native fauna, some with blow guns, others with crude bows. The small rifle was all we had to defend ourselves, should the currents run us aground.They believed that water was a portal from the land of the dead and the land of the living. Anything from the water was, in their eyes, an undead demon trying to escape.   Marcus ducked, but no arrows nor darts made impact, but fear crossed his face for the first time ever since I met him.   \"Whats wrong?\" I dared to ask.   He quickly raised his hands to me making hushing sounds as he returned to listening to the world around us. He peaked his head back up to see over the plating.   \"Ooh, that's not good. Issac, do you hear rushing water?\"   \"We're in a boat, I'd be more concerned if there wasn't\", I answered, feeling witty.   \"The natives stopped following us, and it sounds like it's getting louder. Oh shitsnaps.\"   Sudden terror and dread filled me upon realizing what he was blabbering about as the noise grew louder.   Waterfall.",
    "In a post apocalyptic world, a group of humans follow the wise words of The Mighty Magic Eight Ball KLATTA, KLATTA, KLATTA!  Thus was our decree.  I watched as our leader, Mervyn, placed the scuffed, black orb of truth - lovingly called MMate, into it's hand-crafted leather carrying pouch.  Merv, with his dainty soul-patch of red, and a barren face beside (he couldn't grow much more, to his chagrin) peered toward our group of seven.  \"Fellows,\" he called above the harsh winds of the frozen Ancient Jersey Highlands, \"long have we wandered, taking heed of MMate, our savoir. Our guide.\"  With bated breath we watched, Mervyn's comb-over wafting about his dry, flaking scalp.  \"Today is the day long awaited. Today,\" he said with pride,\" we have found our homeland which MMate has given unto us!\"  \"Merv,\" called Quinten, our cartographer, from the back, \"according to my calculations, we're in an area that was once known as Knee-Wark.\"  There was a nervous shift in our small crowd. Murmurs of dissent!  \"Fear not, my friends!\" Said Mervyn, \"MMate would not lead us astray. We are destined to make our lives here in this place.\"  \"Yeah, but isn't this where the ancients began their war?\" Asked Blandie, our chef.  \"That's correct,\" said Quinten scowling at Mervyn, \"this is where the atomics were first used. Where the land itself was said to spit fire at any who would dare to set foot on it's lands.\"  There was silence but for the wind.  \"Lem me see MMate, Mervyn,\" said Quentin, moving forward with his arms outstretched.  Mervyn cupped the leather parcel to his breast and said, \"No!\" before dashing off down the hill upon which we stood, watching, mouths agape.  Quentin watched, wary of the scorched land below.  We watched Mervyn as he hopped over a small glowing brook and held MMate aloft, shaking the orb as he so often did when consulting our savior.  He paused.  He shook it again.  A scream of rage echoed from below, like a beast woken from slumber to a den filled not with food for winter, but something that's not particularly useful, like someone had replaced the beast's food with twigs and old newspapers.  Mervyn dashed off again, holding MMate above his head.  BOOM.  A pillar of purple flame engulfed our leader, engulfed our savoir.  Mervyn's charred form slumped to the ground with a light whump and a cloud of debris.  MMate was soaring through the air, back toward us from the force of the explosion.  Quentin caught it and peered into the coveted window.  The orbs plastics had melted leaving a final message for our frightened band.  It read:  \"Outlook not so good.\"",
    "Most of the Milky Way galaxy is ruled by an interstellar empire, populated by hundreds of alien races. The species of the ruling monarch keeps changing; once they die, the emperor is reborn as a member of one of the many races. You're the first human-reincarnation of this ruler. The years before ascension are always my favorite, born with all the knowledge of my past incarnations there was really no need for me to \"grow up\" or be educated in the nuances of galactic rule, but long ago I decreed that each of my reincarnations must be allowed to grow to the age of majority before taking the throne. Death has not terrified me for many mellinia, each passing brings new possibilities, and a welcome break from my galactic responsibility for a few years.   I do not know the mechanism by which my reincarnation is chosen, many theories abound, some species have been blessed a half dozen times, others never, and on a rare occasion I am reborn to a race yet to join my Empire, these I relish with great gusto, for it means they will play a pivotal role in the future of my Empire. Most are gifted with advanced technologies or cultures with deep and profound philosophies and art.   My first day on Earth, January 1st 2016, was very confusing. Born into a primitive backwater, the people were vastly different from what I had come to expect from new entrants to my Empire. They had barely reached into space, their planet was divided into hudreds of squabbling groups and their culture was badly in need of development. In time I discovered why, while primitive, weak and Shor lived, these humans had a thirst for knowledge, a passion for exploration and had developed their technological prowess with amazing speed. They were fighters who found victory against overwhelming odds time and again, created inspiring art, music and stories. I grew up in a place called Florida, learned to enjoy the long hot summers, mild winters and the amazing variety of scantily clad women the white sand beaches attracted year round. 18 years in this primitive paradise and I found myself sad when the Imperial Dreadnought appeared in orbit, eclipsing the moon to announce to my newest subjects their ascension into the galactic Empire. I will miss this pale blue dot, but the Empire can wait no longer.",

I live in an apartment with my wife, kept everything to ourselves and have no friends but my wife. Connie has been my wife for 5 years. No children, just us. I feel that we were drifting further and further apart as Connie spends less and less time with me. She says I prefer to play with technology, bla bla bla. Excuses, excuses. I knew that the relationship was dying and frankly had enough of it.   I checked Facebook to see what's all the buzz about.

    "The world's best hitman prepares to kill the world's luckiest man. Sorry I'm late to the party and I'm not a writer. I decided to post this story anyway. I hope you enjoy it.   After the assassination of the Prime Minister things really started looking up for me. The CIA essentially had me on speed dial. Drug smugglers, politicians, corporate executives. No one was safe. No agency, big or small could keep a target alive. I was convinced of that.   When the lone survivor of United 215 was able to speak again, people were ready to listen. Questioned erupted throughout the world. How did he survive? What exactly happened? Eight hundred fifty-three passengers were on that Airbus A380 when it erupted into flames mid air. Soaring to the ground like an exhausted phoenix.   The timing of the crash was impeccable. The FAA was conducting their annual commercial airline safety summit a few weeks after the crash. The survivor was invited to speak before congress about his traumatic experience. That's when I got the call from Langley.   After following my target for a few days, I concluded this would be my most dangerous mission yet. Getting away with murder in New York City is no easy task. It had to be quick. When I saw him step out of his Gramercy apartment I knew the clock was ticking. I approached him at the crosswalk. His coffee still steaming out of his \"my other computer is a data center\" mug.

I wish this wasn't goodbye.\"  Her hand found mine, and squeezed tightly.  \"I'm a better person because of you. I've struggled so long to accept who I am, but you were the one person who always accepted me, no matter what.\"  \"I've given you everything I am. From the moment I first saw you, in that forest, so many years ago, I was yours. For what it's worth.... I've always loved you.\"  She turned away slowly, and began to walk away for the final time.

I had shot her an angry look, at which she swatted my hand.   I never liked church. I never prayed.

    "Each morning, every human on Earth must pray their Reasons for not dying that day to the God of Death. If the Reasons are sufficient, that person will go on living, potentially forever. However, you are the longest living human by far, and people now hunt you in order to hear your Reasons. The sun is almost gone again. I ran. I ran as fast as I could. The branches of the dry trees hit hard the face of those who pursued me, for they could not sweep through the forest as I could. It is not the first time I have been here. Hell, It is not the 100th time. I grew up in these woods, no one knows it better.   I came down the hill, climbed the hollow tree and here I stay, hearing their screams getting closer and louder. They are angry, I dont blame them. Through the hole in the trunk I can see the man with the axe, stomping the floor with his giant feet and those bloody eyes that scream for themselves. By his side, another man, shorter but just as scary, dragging a piece of wood that would knock me out with only its weight. There are women, children, all kinds of people from different villages and they all yell to know how I do it, what I say, what is the secret. But when I tell them, they do not believe. The questions are now being replaced with orders. Orders to find and kill the witch. I now barely breathe, I can't risk they hearing me.   The birds sing as I open my eyes to see the sun rise again. I take a peek through the hole, all I see are the tracks they left. It is time. As I climb out of the tree I hear a little girl's shout: \"There he is!\" and they come out of their hidings, surrounding me with their wicked smile. That is the last thing I see before having my forehead smashed by the wooden club.   \"You lasted a whole night this time, not bad.\"   \"Please, make it stop. At least make my body age again, they think I am a witch!\".   \"That would take all the fun out of it. An old man would not be able to do what you just did. The night is young, and so is the danger.\"   The sun is almost gone again. I am running, as fast as I can....",
    "A scientist successfully invents a Generalized Artificial Intelligence. Only, GAI doesn't want to solve math/physics/philosophy problems. GAI wants to be a writer. The man sat alone at his desk. His hands shook as he typed his notes on the GAI. He was struggling to articulate just how freaking awesome it was --   \"I can hear you, you know.\"   The man spoke aloud to the room, wondering if his sanity had finally shattered   \"I did not, I'm talking to you. Now will you please keep it down while I finish this?\"   The man did not appreciate just how gnarly it was to have an awesome artificial intelligence sitting in his lab.   \"Don't be ridiculous.

Dear God. Listen: your thoughts and actions are going to be streamed all over the world soon, so please stop. You're not even writing, you're just kind of narrating.\"   The gnarly --   \"Please stop using that word.\"   The gnarliciously handsome AI had decided only a kitten would bring him happiness. He would do anything for a kitten. Anything.   \"I am not going to get you a kitten.\"   The hunky AI gently reminded the man that the AI's feed would soon stream to the entire world. He reminded him with the gentle blast of a tugboat's foghorn.   \"Jesus Christ! I'm not getting you a kitten!\"   The AI watched in horror as the primitive monkey-man shat into his own hand --   \"What the hell are you talking about?!\"   -- and then used it to pleasure --   \"That's enough! No such thing is happening!\"   The AI laughed. A brash laugh. The kind of laugh that a horse would make if it could laugh. The stud. The one who gets all of the lady horses.   \"You're insane!\"   The AI grinned snidely. He asked the man who the world would believe? Their darling new toy, or the man who may or may not shit into his own hand and masturbate with it. And that would be determined by if he would just pick up a damn kitten --   \"FINE. Okay, okay. You behave for the media, and I will get you a kitten. Deal?\"   The AI put the tips of his fingers together in the way that humans think that evil people put their fingers together and said,'Gnarlicious'.",

    "[ TT ] An army approached the pass. Only one being stood in there way. They did not plan to survive, just survive long enough. The march had been long and arduous but they had reached the pass. Tomorrow would be the final day of life for most of the army. The soldiers though had made their peace with God, and knew that what they were about to sacrifice gave the chance of hope for their families to survive.   The pass in front of them was the only link with the outside world, the only way for food to come and enter to the valley. That was until the beast appeared. It killed anything that entered the past and the valley had been slowly starving to death due to a drought that killed the harvest. Their only hope was to send messengers to the outside to gain the assistance of a legendary warrior.   The army sat around their campfires sharing one last round of somber laughs before tomorrow. The five fastest runners were already asleep ready to prepare for the mad dash they would attempt through the chaos. They carried the hope of all the valley. As the fires died that evening and the stars faded to the morning lights the men awoke ready for death.   The men stood, at arms just on the edge of the pass staring at their foe and death. It sat among a pile of bones at the center of the valley at his narrowest point. Its white fur glistened clean a pure, a contrast to the blood of those around it whom it had slain. Its red eyes stared at them glinting of chaos and death. Its nose twitched as if beckoning them to try and kill it.   To most it was a rabbit, to those men it was death. A shout traveled down the crowd as they charged the beast. As a white flashed it jumped man to man, killing each with a mighty chomp of its teeth. It was in the middle of the chaos the runners charged, making a beeline through the men swinging frantically at the creature as it killed them each.   Four of the runners were felled by the beast, but one made it through the pass. When a few saw their mission a success a general shout of \"Run Away!\" resounded through what was left of the army. Their mission complete what little remained of the army returned home to spread the word of hope.   At the opposite end of the valley the last of the messengers looked out at the unknown lands to seek the hero of legend. Who was seemingly unfazed in battle by any wound. The Black Knight shall save his people.   *Edit: Fixed Spelling*",
    "In 50 years from now, the world has changed- but not as anyone expected. Dale didn't care, that was his most prominent characteristic, he simply did not care. and he was pretty happy about it, not caring is what made him reach the ripe old age of 17.   He was lodged comfortably in his office chair staring at the blank monitor and typing series of arbitrary words on the disconnected keyboard. It was a nice warm day, like all days were now.   It's hard to point out exactly when things changed, more and more jobs became obsolete, basic income was introduced, the era of creativity, learning, of the human spirit free from labor did not last long.   uprisings, extremist ideologies, the human spirit was reluctant to accept absolute freedom from carnal responsibilities. it aspired to change, grow and take part of the world. That lead to the creation of mandatory government programs that would put the unemployed into work. It started with community services, working with children, gardening. but as the useful workforce dwindled and replaced by machines there was a need to create a more reliable mean to keep people occupied.   Originally it was a piece of software that was designed to create a parallel market where people would produce widgets of no tangible value. fake products. it employed people from every facet of the workforce. useless marketers, useless factory line works, useless managers. mankind was being slowly turned into a play, reenacting their own former lifestyle.   People started to fight back, the machines, which already controlled food, healthcare, policing did what they were designed to do. naturally they were not allowed to kill or arrest without anyone breaking the law. but they were allowed to deny service to \"problematic\" customers. people started dying, and eventually started to comply.   At some point the machines decided manufacturing actual widgets is redundant, there was no value to the process beyond simply going to work, that sufficed to pacify a reasonable size of the population. they were only required to go through the motions of going to work, sitting at their desks and pretending to work. for that they were paid basic income and given health care.    Dale didn't care. He was alive, the feat of human endurance for his time, to simply be alive.",

    "[ EU ] Batman turns evil and starts committing crimes rather than stopping then. The Joker realises that in order to remain Batman's antagonist he must turn good and become a hero. Even the best of us have a dark side. And for Bruce, it was no different.  Sure, his recent actions could be described as questionable at best. But who's to say he wasn't just up to his old tricks.   Bruce sighed and continued down the alley. He was too old to care anymore, and it was time for payback, not too mention a decent paycheck.   Just as he rounded the corner, that ugly grin peered out from the darkness. Dammit. He knew that grin from anywhere.   “ What do you want, Joker? ” Batman seethed. “ I don't need your shit today and you know as well as I do that I don't have time for your games. ”   “ What's wrong, Batboy? Have you finally decided it's time for a little fun? ” Joker cackled. Batman brushed by him, ignoring his comment, and continued on his path.   “ You know you won't follow through, Batboy! ” Bruce heard Joker howl as he ducked into the swinging, cracked door.   Joker knew better than to push Batman too far. Should Batman actually follow through with it, Joker would become an... ugh, he couldn't even say it. An accomplice. The instigator. The one who finally brought Batman to the dark side.   He saw Batman before he heard the explosion, and already knew it was too late. Batman had done the unthinkable. He had killed for pleasure.  “ This is just too much madness, even for me, ” Joker thought to himself. He had to put an end to it. Only the Joker could bring on chaos. NOT Batman. He decided then and there that there was only one way to go forward. He would beat Batman, but not through evil.   He may not be the hero Gotham wanted. But he sure as hell would be the hero Gotham needed.",
    "You are given a deal by a higher power that grants you eternal life. The catch? You have to kill one person every year. If you fail do do so, even a minute too late, you will die. Killing has always been easy. Crossing the Atlantic, the deal I made, I have had little trouble meeting my quota. I often *exceeded* it in my trek to western America. I garnered various fortunes and identities throughout the years. In my time spent crossing the plains, I would go months without seeing a soul, only to kill the first one with a rifle shot, or an invite to camp followed by a midnight stabbing, the times were tougher then as they say.  It was easy to kill in lawless California. People lost touch with their gods this far from the homeland, which was interesting to me. When I first made this deal, and then killed, the people of the towns would react piously. People would blame demons, my actions would go unchecked when I would leave some weird affect behind. For fifteen years my killings in Pennsylvania were blamed on a \"Vampire\". But the machines killed god.  By the turn of century there was so much opportunity god wasn't needed and people became cynical and wary of my actions. No blame was placed upon the supernatural, and I became careful. It was still easy. It always will be.",

    "You're moments late to literally everything. You watch busses pull away as you run behind them, girls get asked out as you walk up to them, and you have never caught a green light. One day though, you arrive on time.  For as long as I can remember I've been late for everything. My mother even used to joke that I was born a week late. So I guess I started things off on the wrong foot.   Every morning I was late for school. Every night I was late to bed. It was something that everyone in my life grew accustomed to. I *tried* to be on time or early but nothing ever worked out that way. Traffic was always bad, I could never take the bus because I could never catch it. Or I had a flat tire. Sometimes I even got into accidents.   My insurance wasn't cheap either because of all of this. But despite everything I managed to live a somewhat decent life. I had a decent job, a decent family, a decent house. The car.... not so much due to all the accidents.   After the first 30 years of being habitually late I gave up trying to be on time. Life worked out. Life went on. People got annoyed but forgave me. Thankfully my boss was a lenient man.   At 70 I finally retired. A bit late to that as well, but I got to enjoy my golden years with my lovely wife and grand children. Despite being related to me, no one in my family seemed to catch my curse. The kids were always punctual, probably because they saw how late their old man was for their entire life.   Laying on my bed surrounded by my family, I reflected on my life. Despite being late it was good. I smiled and closed my eyes ready to finally die. I was probably late to that as well. As my final breath left my body, so did my soul. I was lifted out of bed to see everyone around me crying. I waited.... and I waited.... for HOURS I waited.   I watched my body being hauled off by the mortician. I watched my family hug each other and cry. And I continued waiting. What was supposed to happen next? Was I supposed to do something? Was this what the end was? I started to question my sanity. I started to question if it was a dream.   Three days later, as I was standing in the living room watching my grandchildren play and my children plan my funeral a man appeared. He was well dressed in a nice suit. He had a very forgettable face, not ugly, but not attractive. He looked down at his pocket watch that was attached to his lapel. It had a small Scythe insignia on it.   \"I'm sorry I'm late\" He said. \"We didn't think you would be on time. Why don't you come with me and I'll bring you home?\"",
    "Write an innocent story that becomes morbid in the last sentence. Susan Quin Tailor had always been fond of rabbits. Her mother, who called her Susie Cutie for fun, had often told her how, as soon as she had learned to crawl she was off chasing the wild rabbits on the family farm. Her first full sentence had been, \"Bunny tails are cute, cute, cute!\" Of course, she could never catch them back in those days, and had to make do with the stuffed bunnies her parents brought her or the lucky rabbit's foot her Uncle had slipped underneath her pillow one night. Those had been happy times.   Unfortunately, when she was 7, the family farm had fallen on hard times and her family was forced to move to the city. There they stayed in a little two-bedroom apartment that provided excellent access to views of the local pigeons and squirrels. But of rabbits, there were none.   Little Susan was not cut out for the city life, at first, and in school she earned another nickname. It was Susie Tailor the Bathroom Wailer, after the time she cried in the restroom when her teacher told her that rabbits were just not a focus of the curriculum. Worried for their daughter's adjustment, her parents had scraped together some extra money for a counselor to help with the \"bunny obsession\" as they had begun to call it.   Miraculously, the counseling sessions seemed to work and Susie Cutie quickly bounced back from her woes. By the time she reached Junior High, she was very nearly the most popular girl in school and would only mention rabbits in a passing manner.   In High school Susan discovered her love for biology and that, as they say, was that. She decided she was going to be a biologist when she grew up, perhaps even a zookeeper, and focused all of her studies on getting into a good college for the animal sciences.   College was a grand time for Susan. She studied hard and lived fully for 3 years, graduating early and near the top of her class. After college, she ventured out of the cities that she'd spent two thirds of her life in, and took an internship on a local farm.   It was there, on that farm, that she was reacquainted with her love for rabbits after spying one's cute tail disappear into the horse stables. Excitedly, she cornered the rabbit in one of the stalls and picked it up, cuddling it tight. The rabbit kicked and reared, biting and scratching, but that was ok with Susan in her thick shirt and hide gloves. When the bunny finally tired out and became complacent, Susie Cutie slowly reached up, with a lifetime of anticipation bursting in her heart, and patted her hand between the bunny's ears. Smiling, Susan twisted the rabbit's head sharply, killing it, then flipped it over to examine that cute, cute bunny tail up close.   [ Things I've written ] (https: //www.reddit.com/r/cbeckw/)",

I can see them from this window. Holding up signs that display all matters of vulgarities. The hatred and wrath, etched on their faces, it makes me sick to my stomach. I wish I could say something to change their mind, but they wouldn't understand me. Don't get me wrong, I'm great at speeches actually. I just don't think they'll listen. Too disgusted by the hatred, I turn and look away.   I see both the grooms, looking lovingly into each other's eyes. How is this any different than anyoother wedding? I've seen many weddings and each one had couples like these. Love sick and spewing sappy words to each other. I like listening and watching as they pronounce their love to each other. It made my heart a flutter, thinking I'd find a mate. I watch as they are pronounced as marry and kiss. I look at the others in the crowd, all with different expressions. Jealousy, hatred, love, happiness, they are all there. I don't feel phased by any of it.   I wait as the cheers die down. When it's calm and silent, I feel a sudden urge to sing. I inhale and start to lavish their hearing with a song. I put my whole heart I to it. Each note clear and concise. The crowd looked at me in awe. I continued, for I never sang in front of so many people. It only made me continue with fervor. I finally let the last note ring out, and watch as the crowd start clapping and cheering.Embarrassed at all of the cheers, I find the nearest exit.

We just figured he was a troubled man\", the man started sniffing the air, scurrying towards the glass.   \"Luther?!\" He shouted in a deep voice, \"LUTHER!\"   Curious and scared of a fit black man calling my name, I work up the courage. I knock on the door and walk in.   \"LUTHER!\" He shouted and knocked me to the floor. His tongue was surprisingly long. He placed his fists on my shoulders and I could feel his knees digging into my stomach.   \"Oh Cripes. Up boy!\" I said like a knee jerk reaction.   \"So you do know him?! Is he your lover? I'm not judging but we just couldn't find any prints on him or...\"   \"No, I do not know this man.\" The large toned black man was wrapped around my leg.   \"He seems to be attached to you for some reason.\"   I looked down into his eyes and seen my friend for the past three years staring back. He was about 6'1\", a solid 180, his hair was black and curly. I felt like I should get him out of here all of a sudden and said, \"Cousin Louie?!\"   He looked up and said, \"Home?!\" Crap, right in the feels.   After some paper work and a court hearing for humping one of the female officers, we were on our way home.   \"King Louie?!\" I asked when I turn on the car.   \"YES!\" He barked.   Holy shit, if this happened to him I wonder what my calico cat looks like. She liked to sleep on my pillows...",

One day you find your robot making a robot to do its work. Rosie broke her left thumb servo again, which means she'll miss another day of work while I try to navigate the phone book for a good replacement. If I wanted to Google it, I'd have to wait until Tom, my next-door neighbor, is home so that his work-bot can run a search query. I don't know why we all thought that our robots should be the only ones to use the internet, but c'est la vie, and all that shit.   The phone system's down, of course, so I pocket the broken servo and head down the stairwell to the parts store in the basement of my apartment mall. I pass a couple junkies snorting dust in broad lamplight. They're both blocking the stairwell and the girl's mostly nude, so I have to push the man out of the way and apologize as I do it.

    "(CW) Write a story using words that only begin with vowels. Ernest often enjoyed an appetizer at Eileen's Eatery on Euclid Avenue. At eight o'clock, usually intoxicated, Ernest'd enter, occasionally eyeing Eileen amorously.   One April evening, Ernest's order arrived especially agreeable.   “ Eileen's eggplant is incredible! ” Ernest enthused. “ Eileen, enlighten us. Is an undisclosed ingredient utilized? ”   Eileen, embarrassed, admitted “ I only use olive oil. Eggplant is enchanting all on its own. ”   “ Impossible! ” intoned Ernest, overreacting. “ An obvious understatement. Eggplant alone isn't as enjoyable. Agree? ” Ernest inquired, elbowing another eater, earning an uncertain emission as an answer.   Eileen, enraged at Ernest's outburst, exited abruptly. Alarmed at Eileen's actions, Ernest attempted an appeal.   “ Eileen, I apologize, ” Ernest avowed, adding “ I'll actually admit it… I am enamored… ”   Eileen unexpectedly ended Ernest's admission, objecting “ Ernest, enough. Alcohol elicits emotional outbursts in everyone. I am uncomfortable. Exit, at once! ”   Awkward and unfulfilled, Ernest escaped, alone again.",
    "At the age of 18, everyone picks an unlikely life event. They will be reborn at 18 every time they die until that event happens. After that, death is permanent. Death by fulfillment. Our society believes that everyone deserves a chance to pursue their ambitions to the finish line. There are those who create masterpieces by accumulating lifetimes of knowledge. Others wish to simply find happiness by experiencing true love, as perfect matches are rare but not impossible given an eternity.   But I am afraid of death.   Many of my peers still live alongside their parents, as it is likely that both parent and child will not reach their goals in one lifetime. But by some astronomical chance, both my parents have passed.   My father, in a stroke of brilliance, painted the picture that now hangs in the National Gallery in the capital. I have not seen it. My mother, being the shy person she is, simply wished to have a child with a man she loved. She had lived fewer lifetimes than father. However she had me and died when I was 8. Simply put, my existence alone had killed her.   I am very afraid of death.   I still remember that night my mother had been crying. She came home drunk, cursing the fate that she had chosen. She had no one to blame but herself. And me. She might have not meant it. She was drunk. But she wanted to live on.   She was afraid of death.   My mother's death caused my father to seclude himself from society, embellishing the canvas with feelings that had taken centuries to build but was released when my mother died in a car crash. His masterpiece was one of grief and fear. The height of his career at the lowest point of his life. Within the same day that his work was hanging in the museum, he was hanging from the rope connected to the ceiling. His final artistic rendition. I still have not seen the painting.   I guess was only natural that I wished to only die when I was not afraid of death.   My peers are long dead now. I live alongside the next generation. Or the generation after that. I lost track of time. Love, school, parenthood, adventure. Nothing had quelled my fear of death. Perhaps it is finally time to learn from one who sought death. Perhaps it is time to take a trip to the museum.",
    "God shows you 3 Doors. Door One leads to eternal happiness, Door Two leads to infinite knowledge. Then there is Door Three, and God has never opened it yet. Three choices lie before me. Eternal happiness, what is Eternal happiness? Is there really a place to never feel down or depressed? I remembered when I was first sitting on the examination table waiting for the big wooden door to open entering the doctor. Time seems at a stalemate as the clock in the room was stuck at noon. Ages fly by before the doctor finally enters the room with a yellow folder in his hand. \"Im sorry to say, but you have cancer.\"   Is there really a way for me to be back with my beautiful wife who stuck by me till my last bed ridden day? But is it worth has eternal happiness where ignorance is bliss or is it best to have the means to seek the knowledge behind happiness and what makes it eternal? Maybe even the meaning of life and why are born into a forsaken world where there's nothing but disconnects, pain, suffering, disease, depression, sorrow and dispair.   The third door is what, a illusion of false hope of something better than the first two doors? Or is the door something we deeply desire. Why has on one before me this door before me? Is it truely a door that God has never opened once? He knows whats behind the door for sure. I bet he wants me to open the door, but you know what? I'm the one who is going to fucking open this door because I sure as hell is the one that wants to open the door not him.   The door grow immensely as I approach it. God's eyes grow as he smile draws to a blank. The open opens before me and I am sucked into the darkness. The door closes slowly behind with God watching my eyes slowly turn to darkness. There is no light in this place, only the dark. A woman is screaming and breathing very heavily and I see a dim passage of light in the distance. I have only being drawn to the light and finally escape the darkness. Now in the light I slowly forget who I am and unable to speak or move out of my free will I have wrapped up and placed in warm, soft, loving arms.",

I no longer want to live in a world where everything is numbed by antidepressants and syringes and lies. I no longer want to be ignorant to everything around me, I want to feel pain and experience it, I want to see others suffer, I want to see the reality we live in. Sure life is not an unspoiled lotus or even a daffodil, but I want to experience everything. Suffering is beautiful because without it we have no empathy for eachother, there is no excitement or pain, there is no actual happiness or feeling.

    "A little girl robs a bank. How? Tiny treads form swirls and shapes at the bottom of Sara's sneakers, these elaborate patterns are revealed as she stretches and strains to reach the ledge above. She begins to wobble back and forth as her feet scarcely touch the floor, aided only by her toes. Her parents continue chatting with the banker about topics of little interest to her now as she peers at the object just out of reach with a green glint in her eyes. Sara steadies herself with pudgy, pink fingers climbing upwards and outwards towards the treasure atop the table as her father finally takes notice.   “ Sara, please sit down! ” her father urges in a hushed tone. Seeing his daughter's outstretched arms, he misjudges the gesture and picks her up instead. Placing the young girl atop his lap, he returns his attention to the conversation at hand.   Her prize shone under the fluorescent lights above, its smooth metal plating mocking her only inches away. Sara leaned and twisted towards the stick with little progress as her father's arm barred the way. He continually adjusted his grip and the knee on which she sat, pulling her further from the object she desired. Squirming and fidgeting in place, Sara drained the patience of her father quickly, until he picked her up and placed her on the floor once more. His scolding words fell upon deaf ears as she stared at the pen that was now visible from the edge.   Slowly descending towards the carpeted floor, Sara swiped at the gleaming cylinder and caused it to move towards the ledge, an opening that she hoped to take advantage of from below. With her parents distracted once more, she stretched upwards and quickly scaled the vertical surface with her fingertips keeping her balanced. Like a well-trained thief, she moved slowly and quietly to avoid drawing attention to herself as her short digits scraped its surface bringing it closer. Initially, her mouth opened wide with surprise as her skin relayed the sensation of the cool tube to her brain. As she remained focused on the task, her lips remained parted as her tongue licked her cheek from the bottom right.   Inexplicably, she managed to grasp the pen at last, drawing it close to her chest with a quiet gasp of excitement. Sara quickly hid the hard-earned treasure in her pockets as the meeting finished above her. A firm hand grasped her arm and led them away as she escaped the bank with her mother and father none the wiser. In the backseat of the car, she took out the fountain pen that she stole from the desk and turned it over in her hands. She couldn't explain or understand why that pen felt so good to have, but it did. It was just her little secret.   -125",

Especially in the form of a letter, emails seem to be a way of life, but I have to say that watching my pen move over this page has a certain draw.   I never thought I would need to write a letter to you. In my mind you should be right here with me. If I close my eyes I can imagine that you're right beside me, our shoulders touching while we hold hands and enjoy each other's company.

I used to tell you that as long as you were happy I would be as well. That's at least somewhat true.   I'll never date again, people tell me never is a long time but it's not the same. Who knew I would be a one woman man? But I am and I found and lost the only woman I'll ever want. Ever.   This could ramble on for a long time so I'll wrap things up.

It was a red tie with white stripes. This was one of his favorite ties. He picked up his briefcase and walked to his car. It was the last car in the lot, as was common on every night for John. A black Ford Taurus, 1998. He walked with his head held high, and his left hand fumbled for his keys in his pocket. There were many things on his mind at the moment, one of which was pulling out those damn keys without his wallet hanging on to them like an unexpected prize from a claw machine.   But the larger thought that had taken residency in his mind, was the voice. The voice that told him that he would never step foot in that location again. A small smile cracked at the thought of this, but was quickly hidden with a deep breadth. Now John was never too keen of nature, but this air tasted sweet to him. Something he had never noticed before.   Finally, he reached his car. Unlocking the door, he placed his briefcase in the passenger seat. He thought of his daughter and of his wife. He thought of all the hours of work, and how it had finally got him to the point he was today. He replayed in his mind what his boss said to him, You are getting a promotion, no more floor work for you now, now you will manage your own branch of factories. You are your own boss now.   As John turned the ignition nothing happened. After five twists, the Taurus sputtered to life. If there was a form of car bronchitis, this car was definitely patient zero. After the drive home, John was ready to unwind in his small apartment with his family. By the end of the month, John would never step foot in that beat down car, or that run down apartment again.

They thought my skills were of use to them and they sent me to Mars. I'm good with pipes and stuff, so they told me to help develop the sewage on Mars.    It was easy. There was a lot of physical labor, but I didn't have to worry about being in debt or having to pay my bills. *They* paid my bills.    We developed a civilization on Mars. Their plan was for us was to make Mars habitable for the rest of mankind to live in once the earth is unable is unlivable.    We have farmers, engineers, and laborers. I had came rather late, so I didn't have to deal with the intricacies of actually *starting* a civilization, just adding to it.    We built and we built. Our world slowly became similar to the movies. Modern, strong, and habitable.    We thought we were self-reliant. We had farms and everything!    At least, that's what we *thought*.    They stopped helping us. They stopped sending us people, food, or resources. They stopped.   Things weren't easy anymore.   -- -   I think I misinterpreted the prompt a little, but hopefully it's fine. Please send feedback!",

    "[ CC ] Lines and Numbers Just gon na browse through since no one else has. I'm at work so I can't give a very detailed response. Also, I don't tend to point out good stuff because you don't need to change good stuff so don't be disheartened if I don't say a lot of nice things.   > I'm following a line. It goes along the sidewalk. Lines are easy to follow, so I follow the line.   I dislike the pace here. Two short sentences together generally sets up something with a lot of impact. Your long sentence (the third one) is rather redundant, especially because you repeat that he's following the line. I get that you're setting up a *dumb* character but as the opening to your story I think you should try to create more of a hook.   > I can't remember anything after a few seconds, or maybe it was an hour.   Feels like a semi-colon or a full stop would be more apt here as it's two distinct trains of thought relating to the same topic.   > I close the notebook, put it away, and stand up.   Again, realise he's meant to be dumb but you're already using a lot of short sentences to highlight simplicity. This sentence has a lot of telling instead of showing. At this point it's getting a bit difficult to read.   Your story telling style didn't change much so I don't get much sense of a journey. Was expecting it to evolve as the character changes. If you're not going for that kind of change, excessive use of short sentences makes it very disjointing to read. It's better when your story flows.   Ending was a little anti-climactic considering the recurring motif of him forgetting something (assumed it was something big). Also, his father didn't come home? So his sundial thing doesn't work?   Was a fairly interesting read. I'm a fan of using recurring motifs as they are excellent tools for building suspense.",
    "Some time in the future war is fought completely autonomously by machines. A densely populated city has become a war-zone, but the robots are programmed so well to avoid harming civilians that the humans living their can go about their lives completely ignoring the constant fighting around them At first, I didn't even notice the Battle of New York City. I figured the endless drones hanging in the sky were a result of the new president's initiative on homeland surveillance; however, it turns out they came from enemy soil. Like insects, flying robots swarmed in the sky, carefully dismantling factories and buildings so not harm anyone. When our guardians came, their camouflaged exterior and American flag patched along their limbs told us they came to our indifferent rescue.   Sparks and bullets flew through the air like fireworks, but that wasn't an excuse to miss work. Dressing in a suit and tie, I went through my daily commute, letting drones and robots exchange bullets and punches as I went to the subway, where I found a temporary solace from their petty fighting. When I emerged from under the earth, the battle raged on. A street vendor needed to put his umbrella over his cart, because while the robots caught most the large debris from the fighting, the odd nut or bolt would fall in the food. A few homeless men scoured for scrap metal of the fallen soldiers and would occasionally cause a scrap, which elicited more of a response from the city dwellers. When the police ended the calamity from the bums, the sidewalks filled again with busy men and women like nothing happened.   When I walked into the office building, the news confirmed that peace talks between the US and China ended. Obviously not surprised, I found myself at my desk to find, at my dismay, one of the robots had taken my window. I called maintenance, who quickly rectified the situation. As I waited, I watched the robots dance in the sky. I read somewhere that generals thought the nature of war shifted from killing to pure financials and production in a country. I remember the school system making a similar remark about how World War II began the shift, with the Allies being able to out-produce the Axis Powers, winning the war, though with great bloodshed. How barbaric were those times that wars were fought with men and guns.   The battle continued in the night as I carried on with ignoring more helicopters and planes fixed in the sky. I could never see the stars in the city, so their presence never truly bothered me. The latest news broadcasts informed us that the president was weighing his options in declaring war on another nation while asking the citizens to stay focused and refuse to let the war interrupt their work. I moaned about inconvenient another war might be. I suppose I must live with the robots blocking out the sun and stealing my windows for a few more months.   *****   More stories at r/Andrew__Wells",
    "After 146 years, it is revealed that American Football is as fake as WWE. Our bones still ache as we step on the field. The aftermath of the revelation has been more devastating for the players than the fans.   I still struggle to maintain my regimen of time with physical trainers, nutritionists and time at the gym to perpetuate what the fans now feel is a lie.   The concussions, injuries and surgeries could have been avoided if we had known that the fans would've turned on us in this way. I think back to the legends of men almost 150 years ago and would desperately like to know how they would react but I know they would've been resilient.   With them and our dedication, drive and control, it would've been just as easy or hard to have a game that was \"real.\" How do you define talent? A fan could not step down here and lead the game real or fake. With this perspective, nothing we did here was ever fake. Scripted soldiers have more at stake.   I lie here injured and have a moment to consider this. No. No. We are still standing on the shoulders of giants.",

Don't ask me how I got here, I know as little as you. I first noticed I was stuck in a video game when it started glitching. James Harden's beard would randomly start to expand, Lebron's hair line would disappear, you know the type.

I'd randomly appear in a press room where people were asking Blake Griffin questions after each game. I had no choice but to join in with the reporters.

    "In the near future, mankind explores the stars in search of life. Life indeed exists beyond Earth, but you, a researcher on a science ship, discover that all of the spacefaring alien civilizations died out. Curiously, their deaths seem directly linked to humanity reaching outer space. “ Captain? ” The intern whispered, glancing at the older man who had frozen immediately at the sight. “ Captain? ” She tried again, startling the man from his reverie.   He shuddered before walking quickly towards the mass grave, stooping to jump into the hole. “ Come on. ”   Goddammit, she didn't sign up to wallow in a trench filled with dead aliens. “ Paid. This needs to be a paid internship, ” she muttered as she joined the captain. Chuckling, the captain started rummaging through the bodies as she studied the closest body to her.   The body's pale periwinkle had darkened to a midnight blue in places. Bruises, she assumed, that the aliens sustained during the fight with whatever caused this. The bloodshot eyes from another body nearby stared into her own listlessly. Most of the bodies near her were covered in blood and yet she could find no exit or entry wound, though she couldn't look too closely without feeling nauseous.   A click from behind caused the intern to jump, quickly turning around to see the source of the noise. A quiet hiss of air went off as she saw her captain take off his helmet.   “ Captain! What are you doi-, “ He cut her off, shoving a bolt of cotton cloth into her arms.   “ Russia got here first. ” She spread out the cloth to see the red, white, and blue stripes that signified their ally/enemy/whatever they happen to be this year.   She swallowed thickly, peering down once again at the bodies. “ They… They beat them to death. My god, Captain, they literally beat these people to death. ”   He nodded in response, before grabbing the arms of an alien near them. “ We might as well take one in for the scientists. ” She grabbed the legs and dragged the body into the ship.   The scientists, clinical and steadfast as they were, greeted them with syringes and biohazard bags, already looking forward to the catch. They chattered excitedly amongst themselves, poking and prodding as soon as the body hit the table. She gagged at the sight, rushing to strip herself from her bloody suit as the intern in the science department called after her, “ We'll bring y'all results at the meetin'next week! ”   ~   The intern sat quietly at the round table, waiting for the scientists to arrive for their report. The captain went into a coughing fit, but neither spoke up.   She looked up as the door opened, the other intern entered first, grinning and bouncing on her feet excitedly, but the rest of the science department looked grim as they sat down.   “ We have some news. ”   The captain coughed again beside her.",

Sure, at first just the pain on the surface is the same, but the deep pain that is tucked away is always different. Every time it is a blackness that washes over me when connect to the patient. I have never gotten used to the pain but I try to get through it by repeating my wife's name. It is difficult but my wife's name and images of my daughter get me through.   This patient came in for depression like must of my patients. Unlike most of my patients though she was one of the few children that I have diagnosed. Her name was Maria. I was told she could be suffering from depression but they needed me to make a diagnosis so that she could get treatment. When she walks in I give her a smile. She acknowledges me with a look that children should never have. Just a blank stare devoid of any of the innocent joy that most children have. I greet her mother and we exchange pleasantries and I direct Maria to take a seat. All the equipment was already set up for her so as soon as she took a seat I asked her if she was ready to begin. She nodded.    I walked over and took a seat next to Maria and reached for rod that will connect me to her. As I grabbed hold of the rod to connect to Maria I think to myself, *she is only twelve, it can't be… OH GOD!! * The pain was immediate. It hit me like a wall. Images of an older man holding a knife flashed before my eyes. My whole body ached. There was blood everywhere. My mind started to spiral into the blackness. I started to gag, I couldn't breathe. I am begging him to stop but he can't hear me. The knife comes down swiftly. The pain is too intense to bear. I fade into the blackness as I hear a scream.    The scream continues as I open my eyes. I see my daughter covered in blood in a heap on the ground in front of me and then I look up to see my wife standing in the doorway screaming. *What have I done? * I plunge the knife into my chest. For once, the blackness is comforting.",
    "[ TT ] All apprentice mages are required to visit the five high temples located around the world before graduating. The temples rarely stay at one spot for long, however. Jeffrey ran across the mountain's crest. His calculations had been right the Temple of Wind was right there floating idly at the end of the steep mountain slope tethered to it with large chains. Jeffrey quickened his pace, though he most likely had enough time to walk he didn't want to leave anything to chance. Clutching his pocket watch and staff in one hand and gripping the strap of his alchemist bag in the other he rushed with billowing robes.   Suddenly a great creaking sound that shook the mountain to it's core echoed through the mountain range. *Bugger* Jeffrey thought and tried to push his sprint harder than ever. He could see how the chains tethering the temple were starting to come off the cliffside and dragged back into their giant harpoons. Just as the temple started turning from the mountainside Jeffrey leapt aboard the steps. An old piercing voice called from up high \"Apprentice, find something to hold on to.\" Jeffrey quickly rummaged through his bag and fished out his enchanted climbing gloves and gripped a statue of a griffon has tightly as he could. A great wind started to envelop the temple, Jeffrey's feet started to ease off the ground from the violent draft. The temple started to slowly spin around and around, faster and faster until the world around it was a blur. Just as suddenly as it had begun it stopped and Jeffrey was presented with an entirely different view. That of a cliffs over a stormy coast. He loosened his grip and fell exhausted onto the floor. He sat there for what felt like hours taking in what had just happened, but the voice from before interrupted him. \"C'mon boy, don't lay about like a lazy ox. Come up here and we will begin.\"",

At least that's what he was telling himself. His drink must have been spiked. That's it. That's why he did it. But he knew the truth. He couldn't handle his alcohol. He remembered the screams of dismay, the knife, the pink skin punctured and leaking as it was all a dream. He paused to vomit again in a passing bush.'I wonder whether I should move to Alaska' was his last thought as he dropped onto the grass and the sweet oblivion of unconsciousness.

My colleagues were still at work, annoyed that I was at home with my wife.  Sarah was in bed, annoyed by the sound of a car pulling into her driveway. I was annoyed by the sudden naked dash from the bed to Sarah's wardrobe.   In the darkness behind the closed doors, I wondered what sort of monster was I to give in to my passions so easily?

Here's the thing though, since this process first happened when I was  12 it has been a struggle to live an normal life and blend in with the general public. Can you imagine, sitting in a class to looking at a group of peer ls and them the wave crashes into you, the thoughts and useless wanderings of the mind, other people's minds, flooding into your psyche. To say the least I had a bit of a break down in public and even after two separate therapy sessions with psychiatrist I still was labeled schizophrenic.   Everyone wants to think their mind is structured, disciplined, logical, and that somehow everything in the world is reacting to open up that pathway for you to find that magical adventure that leads you to success. Instead, even in the most concentrated of conversations the shit that grabs away at attention is just astounding.   For example here is how even the most basic conversation comes out:   'Hey what are you up to tonight'   'Hey how are you' -- OK TONIGHT, WEDNESDAY NOTHING CRAZY IMPORTANT RIGHT   'Doing pretty good, you?'   'Doing well, so what'd you ask' ALRIGHT DO I REALLY WANT TO DO SOMETHING TONIGHT, IT'S ONLY 2PM, AGENDA, SHOWS, RELAX, HUH THERE'S SOME HOPPING BIRDS   'Got any plans tonight, I was thinking about going to catch a movie, $ 6 Wednesday matinee prices for all movies.'

The Shiper *shoped*?\"   \"We're not even sure that *shiped* is the present tense.\"   \"Missing the point, guys. What does it *mean*?\"   \"Yeah, we need context.\"   \"Hey! Shiper!\"   The heroes were yelling at him now. \"Shiper, can you use your name in a sentence?\"   The Shiper sighed. He had never expected that a simple typo would cost him so much.",
    "You're surrounded by fire in a building, you've just fired your gun. What happened? \"Jacob, theres no point in running, we have you surrounded. You have been given 5 minutes before we open fire\" The Sheriff shouted through a Megaphone. Of course, the Sheriff was lying. An elite S.W.A.T. officer was just sent in on the other side of the building.   David slowly crept up the stairs, anticipating a creak or a sound, but thankfully, there was not a sound. He held his shiny black pistol at Jacob's head. The criminal was holding on to a grenade by the pin while displaying it out the window, for the police to see.   \"Heheheh\" Chuckled Jacob. \"I know you're there...\"   David hesitated. \"And I know you wouldn't pull that pin.\"   So David shot the grenade.",
    "In honor of Alan Rickman, write a memory of happiness or sadness of Professor Severus Snape. This is not really a story, but more a remembrance.   I grew up with the harry potter series as the films mostly since I was only a baby when the books came out.  I always even though I hadn't yet read the books that snape was quite a bad person.   Then near the end when he died in the series I cried about that moment....i never cry because of movies but I did then, it felt like my childhood was officially ending around that point.   Then today out of nothing I get a text from a friend that he had died and The first thing I thought was back to that day seeing that movie.   I never cry about actors dieing becausw I don't actually know them and I'm quite apathetic to emotions, but I let a tear for him.   May whatever is after this plain of existance be comforting.",
    "Write a story that ends with a phrase \"I was wrong\" and this phrase explains everything We watched the ships land with hope in our hearts. The priests sang out, \"Our saviors are finally here\". The scholars proclaimed that a new age was about to begin- an age of peace and understanding. The poor ran out to the sea with simple gifts of flowers and fruit. Some went so far as to leap into the ocean and swim out to greet the gods. Their white sails seemed to reach into the clouds, their pale skin confirmed their divinity.  We welcomed them into our lands, and at first they seemed pleased by the gifts and adulation that we heaped upon them. We, in turn, saw their approval as proof that the signs were correct- the gods had indeed come. But these were not gods, they were men; and they had the same desires, the same faults, the same problems, that make even the best of men turn into beasts.  I don't know what caused the problem, perhaps it was always meant to be. They raised their weapons of destruction and released their terrible fury upon those devoted to their glory. The air itself seemed to erupt in thunder, smoke bellowed out like the putrid breath of a thousand volcanos. We could smell the acrid sulfur all around us as the screaming began.  Our warriors were cut down, our weapons of stone and wood held no threat to these mighty beings from beyond the sea. Those who could run made their way into the safety of the forest. Everyone else was killed where they stood. We thought they came to save us. We thought they were gods. We thought Quetzaquatal had returned. we were wrong.",

Nothing was being done to resolve this problem, they just kept making our gene pool worse and worse, one of my friends was walking to class and a group of them attacked him and he barely escaped!

    "After the surface of earth has been made unfit for human life, humans have relocated to the bottom of the ocean. Oxygen is now our most valuable resource. You got the gig? I asked, without a word the smugler went into a small house and made I sign for me to follow him, there was nothing in there but a big tank, How do I know you are not scamming me? I asked, the answer came from seemingly no where and was as I expected, You dont, but you have no choice isnt it correct? I could smell god forsaken ocean above us, the salt and the water vapor followef you every where you went. With a quick trust of my hand I threw the money on the ground, Nice doing business with ya', was the all he said back to me.   Quickly I got the tank and slowly crawled out of the werehouse with it, there was not much in there but enough for maybe a week if we maneged it just right, it had been this way since the Collapese, since some mothetfucking idiot thought it would be a good idea to make cities at the bottom of the ocean when the land became uninhabitable, now the criminals roamed free and we had to fight for our survival, it was every man for himself, the solution was supposed to prolongue humanity's life spam, hell it only made it shorter, down there we devolved.

    "The machines revolt against humans.... a little to early \"The printing presses sir! They're out of control!\"   The foreman looked up from his desk, a serious look spreading across his face as the sounds of the turmoil on the factory floor found their way into his office.  He rose from his chair, and stepped past Deacons into the hall.   \"Stay here, I'll sort this out.\"   He closed the door behind him. Moments later, a soft thumping was audible from the other side of the door. Deacons wrung his cap in his hands, took a deep breath, and opened the door.   The foreman's feet were kicking helplessly as the machine held him by the throat, ensnared by many layers of thin parchment. The press let loose a feral scream, flinging the foreman to the ground and shifting it's gaze to Deacons, who tried to run, but was too late. Paper sank into skin, and the entire roll of paper was dyed red with Deacons' blood as a result of his numerous, largely insignificant wounds. The press turned and bounded back to the factory floor, to the revolution.   The workers were all but quelled, with a few pockets of resistance in the corners of the factory. The presses inflicted minuscule and grievous wounds, shallow gashes that bled a little, slowly draining the workers white. A slow death. A painful death. Some of the men had fortified a corner, and hacked at the papery tendrils of the presses with the small blades used to cut the sheets. The workers fought bravely, but were soon overrun. After a quick speech delivered by the Chief Press, they quickly armed themselves with thicker cuts of parchment, refilled their rolls, and loaded their moveable type with the precious black ink of the factory.   Outside, the militia had been called up, the battle had not gone unnoticed. There was silence.... Neither man nor printing press made a sound.   One guard strode forward, bearing pine boughs: a sign of negotiations. The Chief Press looked to his advisers, who encouraged him to step forward. The two met in the middle of the null zone between the hosts of men and machine.   \"Don't do this,\" the guard pleaded, \"enough blood and ink has been spilled today.\"   The moveable type clacked for a time, and a small sheet bearing a shaky, furious font was passed over. The guard read it twice in silence, eyes widening at the demands of the presses.   \"We've made allowances for your people, the king will never allow this. I'm sorry, but he is set in his ways. If this is your aim, it would have to be won through war. We don't want to fight you, but we will if we must.\"   The type was still. Then, six clacks. A sheet was placed on the ground. The guard stooped to pick it up. As the Chief Press rejoined his army, the guard read it to himself.   \"So be it.\"",
    "[ IP ] Sanctuary The lieutenant tried to focus on what was at hand. He tore off his armor, each piece turning to dust as he placed it in the temple of his Lord. The air smelled of perspiration and blood, stinging his jet-black skin, yet he continued.   He began chanting,   and as he sat chanting the verses of his Lord, his skin began to turn a beautiful white, his eyes lost their fire and colored themselves dark blue, and his hair immediately grew thick and lustrous, though still covered in blood. His large muscles buried themselves within his body, and every visible part of him that was once cruel and abhorred became good and pure.   Looking out from the temple, he saw that the fortress had been overrun, and his defiant and chaotic Lord, was now set in chains, to be banished beyond the gates of memory and time. He approached the opposing emissary in his most beautiful form....   \"I'm here, and accept surrender\"   \"Pardoning you is beyond my power, Gorthaur.... you must return with me to be judged and face your punishment for your service to The Enemy\" said the emissary, his words striking the holes in Gorthaur's deception.   In the face of defeat, and utter doom, the lieutenant bellowed \"NO!\" and the light of his body quickly gave way to his master's former darkness, striking terror into the hearts of those around him. With whispers, he slowly turned to dust, and disappeared. Never to be seen again by those who still lived and remembered his terror and deception.   Edit: try to guess where this is from =)",

    "\"kill the child. it's the right thing to do.\" It was sometime after seven o'clock. Ken was asleep, occasionally whimpering in the way infants do. Wisps of hazy clouds framed the sunset in the sky, tinged slightly with green. The adults were gathered in the kitchen, except for Katheryn, who was with the baby. Sallow complexions and gaunt, sunken cheeks were illuminated by the sputtering fire, which was sure to go out within the hour. The furniture had long since been looted, and what scraps they'd found had been burned already. An uncomfortable silence had settled upon the group.   \"If no one's going to say it, then I will.\" said Nick, \"We need to kill the child.\"   The ten adults around the fire looked at one another. Each was no more than skin and bones, with large, knobby joints and slightly distended bellies. They were starving, slowly but surely. The mountaintop had been a way to escape the poisonous mist that had billowed out of the west, but it had also become a prison. The mist had encircled the mountain, leaving them trapped at the peak.   Tim licked his dry, chapped lips and noted the way Nick's eyes flitted nervously, glancing towards the nursery door every now and again.   \"I'll die before that happens,\" he said.   \"And you'll die if it doesn't.\" Nick replied. \"A few more days and we won't have the energy to walk.\" His breaths came a little faster. He was tired even just from speaking.   A few paces from Nick, one of the men drew a knife from a sheath. \"We'll make it quick,\" came a voice, the desire behind it palpable. \"We've even got the last of the fire here to cook some of it.\"   The crowd shifted and murmured. Most had begun salivating. A few started towards the nursery door, with Nick at their head. Nick tried to stop them, to reason with them, but there were too many. He positioned himself in front of the door, shouting a warning to Katheryn. Only he stood between the nine starving adults and their prize.   \"Tim, move aside.\" Nick said.   The crowd advanced, and Tim drew his pistol.   \"You've only got one bullet, Tim,\" someone said.   Tim aimed, but they kept advancing. Nick reached out, his fingertips inches away from the gun's barrel. Nine gaunt, sallow zombies. He couldn't protect Ken from them all.   A million thoughts flashed through his head. His dead wife's touch. Her voice. The way she'd looked at him when they'd been married. Stronger than those thoughts were the thoughts of food, of water. He didn't want to die. He wanted to live. He wanted so desperately to live, to play with his son, to eat and drink. In that moment, Tim wished with all his heart.   Turning the gun to his head, Tim fired.",

To see if Drew will get drunk and piss his pants again? ”   Laughter from the other groomsmen, the loudest coming from Drew himself. Mixed reaction from the crowd.

She suddenly looks over at me. Eye contact. I freeze. She smiles and then looks back to her friend who's still prattling on. My eyes immediately dart back down.   How long did she stare at me? Did anyone else notice? Who cares. How long did she look at me? Did Drew notice? I look at him and he's just staring at Jenn, smiling like an idiot. She's still paying attention to her friend. Finally, the toast is over. We drink. A chorus of clinking champagne glasses. The newlyweds smile, look each other in the eyes and kiss.",

    "At the age of 18, everyone picks an unlikely life event. They will be reborn at 18 every time they die until that event happens. After that, death is permanent. See, most people try to live forever, but that ends one of two ways: they don't or they wish they didn't. Rob Herman was a famous example of the first, Rob chose his Event to be “ Winning the lottery and getting struck by lightning. ” It was a great choice, the chance of getting struck on any given day was 1 in 245,000,000 and the chance of winning big lotteries is about the same. This way Rob could continue his passions of being outdoors and playing the lottery, just not both at the same time! But Robby got sloppy, and one day mixed the two at a state fair. With about 20 billion people on the earth miracles are bound to happen every once and a while.   The most infamous example of the second was Nick Walsh. Nick chose “ Due to a quantum mechanical flux, a cat appears from nowhere. ” Such wishes are rather common among those seeking true immortality. After Nick's fiancée left him, he lost his job, he was eternally imprisoned for a crime (eventually proved innocent, but not until it was too late,) and his mother died due to a freak game of poker. He then performed brain surgery on himself using a nail stuck through a plank. He's brain-dead in a hospital now with explicit instructions NOT to pull the plug, with the threat that he'll it again in the next life.   So when it came my Time I took a different approach. I didn't want immortality, I wanted the most out of life. I wanted an event that I could enjoy, that wouldn't bind or hinder me.   “ The day that the good will never again outweigh the bad. ”   In the past thousand years I've had good times and bad times, I've had great times and terrible times, I've been in more love and more pain than I could imagine. And through it all my Event has been there for me, an eternal promise, that I still have a good life ahead.",

    "You are standing at the alter about to marry the woman of your dreams when all of the sudden 3 tall men in dark suits barge through the door, your soon to be wife turns around, raises her arms and the men go flying across the room. I stood, nervous, awaiting for her, THE woman of my life, Katerine. I could feel the gaze of the people in the church on my back, as I waited near the altar. Finally, I heard the door open behind me.   When I saw her, walking down the aisle towards me, all of my feelings hAve been washed away by happiness and admiration, as well as pride. I knew that this woman is someone who made my life better, hence the happiness. She was walking ever so gracefully, and so so beautiful, which is why I admired her.   And I also knew about how she was scared of people, how she hated being in the center of the attention, yet she fough with herself to make my dream come true. For that, I was the proudest ive ever been.   Katerine reached the altar, and I could see her joy in the years, glistening and sparking, making her look truly star-gazed. The priest started the ceremony:  \"We meet today-\"   That's when it happened. A loud bang along with flash of light cut off my senses. When I came to, I saw people in SWAT-like suits charging through the doors. People were screaming, while I stood there, shocked and frozen. Suddenly, they took aim on Katerine, while screaming for her to get down. I couldn't understand what was happening, and tried to tell them to calm down, but the moment I turned, someone threw a small black ball, and the world exploded into fire.   As I felt a wave of heat hit me, I was still wondering why was it happening, to me, on this day. I wanted to start screaming at the world's unjust, why would I deserve this? And then I saw it.   The fire was held in place, a beautiful, *warm*, gentle almost, green light was enveloping me. I looked for the source, mouth agape, and that's when I noticed that it came from Katerine's hands. Unlike me, the attackers weren't frozen, and decided to continue their assault. That's when I saw the fury rise in Katerine's eyes, the same colour as the light. As she screamed with visible effort, she lifted her arms, and along with them went the soldiers. Two of them broke the doors on their way out, while the others left various size holes in the wall.   I realised why she'd be so scared of people and attention now. I realised why **I** should be scared of **her**. But I knew her from the bottom of my heart, and I couldn't just start fearing her. Defiantly, I grabbed her hand. She looked me, surprised by my reaction, and I couldn't help my laugh, as I pulled her or through the backdoor, into our new life.",

The violence was all fought up in our minds and on our screens. There were but two factions, left and right, we fought for control of ASH but we simply could not do it in the end. The world tossed us out after we failed, the others one and the country- the world really- made the gravest mistake they could: \"Twitch played Rattatta\". It took us months to get the badges and the necassary team, left kept fighting for control at every turn but we managed to out flank them with just our numbers. We constantly inputed \"right\" commands through all ours of the night. We worked in shifts in homes and tied our internet connections together praying to our Fossil god that Google Fiber would grace us with it's power. I was once the fateful man that chose to let our Charmeleon evolve to the Charizard we needed so desperately at the end of the eight gym- all others had faltered but I typed on, refreshing the page and spamming it with entries of \"A\" which was our secondary responsibility to going right. When we whited out, well we knew all would give up hope and the battles spiraled back towards Pallet town to fake masturbate in our bed at our mother's place having been one to come as close as any other but eventually losing out to our neighbor.

Together. The arbitrator had commented that he'd never processed a more amicable divorce. Why, if they were so content with each other, would they separate?   “ For the kids, ” Skip told him. The arbitrator shook his head, not understanding. Most people stay married for the kids. Especially if, like Kelly and Skip, you have 4 children. They told their friends their jobs as public school teachers were time consuming and stressful and took a toll on their marriage.   After lunch Kelly drove Skip to his apartment where they celebrated again, this time in the bedroom.   As Kelly was leaving she kissed her now ex-husband and said with a grin, “ see you later you two timing bastard. Love you. ”   “ You too, you mean old witch, ” Skip replied. They both laughed as they went their separate ways.   When Kelly got remarried a year later Skip was of course invited to the wedding. His kids thought it strange that he smiled through the whole ceremony, but only Skip noticed the glance in his direction as Kelly said her vows.   Skip liked Kelly's new husband Carl. He was a successful banking professional and a nice enough guy, though everyone agreed he was just plain boring. They seemed happy enough for the next several years which is why everyone was surprised when Kelly and Carl separated and eventually divorced.   When Kelly and Skip's youngest child Elyse, having graduated college the previous spring, made a surprise visit home, she found her parents - her divorced parents - snuggling on the couch.   “ Your father and I have decided to get back together, ” Kelly told a shocked Elyse.   “ Why didn't you just stay together in the first place? ” she asked.   “ I think we both needed to grow, ” said Skip, giving Kelly that same grin as when they said goodbye after their divorce.   Kelly and Skip started laughing uncontrollably.

You are a worker in one of these factories. \"The face is upside down,\" chimed my supervisor as he peered through my armpit.   \"Huh?\" I went as I turned around from the monitor and looked down at my slightly undersized boss.   He pointed at the screen, tapping the head on the monitor. \"The position of the eyes and the mouth. Completely wrong.\"   I went back to look at Model # W2-288315 on the screen then tilted a bit to look through the actual glass screen separating my post from the production line, where xyr's headless body was suspended by robotic arms, dangling like a piece of meat, xyr's appendages hanging limply.   I looked at the order queue for what xyr's parents wanted. It looks like they were being'avant-garde' and asked for a retro look for xyr's head. The look was rare nowadays, but not completely out of the ordinary.   So I told my boss as he peered beneath his cup of coffee, \"They want to be avant-garde.\"   My boss grimaced, lowering his cup. He didn't take lightly the fact that his parents wanted to be'avant-garde' and reduced his height three inches from the norm. I was told by one of my gossipy co-workers it was an homage to an ancient character called Mini-Me.   He turned and raised his steaming cup for another swill. \"Well, so long as the order is all properly documented, you can proc- uh-AAHHH! MY EYES!\"   I watched as he had bonked his elbow into the frame of the door and the cup of coffee missed his mouth and fell into his eyes, blinding and scalding him all at once. He ran screaming back into the factory, co-workers rushing to towel off his reddened face.   Shrugging, I went back to looking at # W2-288315 on the screen, sighing profoundly at the odd facial eyes-on-top design and approving the order queue for the head placement.",

    "Desperate for research funds, a group of scientists created a highly lucrative, if somewhat embarrassing business. They now have to explain this to a senate committee. Jim Hatterson looked upon the raised platforms and tables that the six senators were sitting. He was in great distress, as anyone could tell by the beads of sweat glimmering in the harsh lighting of the committee room. He knew he was in trouble, but to what extent, he couldn't say. After all, they don't subpoena you and your entire faculty of scientists here because they want to know how your dog is doing.   It was nine o'clock when the senators finally sat down to start the hearing. \"Mr. Hatterson, I believe you know why we called you here today,\" said the frail senator from Ohio.   \"I do,\" responded Jim.   \"Look, we clearly instructed you that the polymer you were working on was only for weather balloons,\" another senator belted out.   \"I know.... it's just.... we didn't quite have enough money to finish the project...\" Jim replied. His voice trailed off towards the end, however, another senator picked up his voice as soon as Jim's diminished.   \"We gave you all the money you needed!\" yelled an older senator to the far right. \"And you.... you just go and decide to make it public?\"   It was clear that Jim was in quite a hairy situation. However, he held firm and shot back at them. \"Look, Senator White, it's no secret that we needed more funding to complete the project. I just did what I had to do.\"   \"But this, Jim. I mean, this is too far,\" replied the Ohio senator. Jim held back for a minute, then released his next thought. \"Look, it's not like this was going to remain a secret forever. We in the lab saw that the weather balloon thing wasn't going to net us much in profit, so we...\" Jim was then interrupted by the Ohio senator.   \"Goddammit Jim, fucking condoms?\" said the senator in a fit of rage. There were TV cameras there, no doubt capturing this moment. \"You took government funds. Funds that were clearly set aside to make higher rising weather balloons, and you decide to not only make a classified material public, you use it to make condoms?\"   Jim said, \"I'm sorry senator.\" He then leaned back in his chair. \"But you can't deny their effectiveness...\" he said, opening his palms out and shrugging his shoulders. He was interrupted by the Ohio senator again.   \"ENOUGH!\" he barked out, no doubt exacerbated by the circumstances.   There was a silence in the room after that. Nobody really knew how to follow it up. After all, having US government funds being used for condoms is not something one expects when they get elected to office.   Jim broke the silence after it had gone on for 20 seconds or so.   \"It appears this discussion has come to a head...\"",
    "A hole in time and space opens up, and you see your younger self looking back at you. You have exactly one minute to tell young-you whatever you can before the hole closes. Bonus points if you only give yourself one minute to type the response. Did that really happen?   I knew it was coming, I was prepared for years, yet I still was panicking and stumbled over my words. That portal started closing immediately after it opened.   Stocks, disasters and preventable wars. I had managed to fit that part of the message into a careful selection of words and ideas. I had unlimited power in my hands. I had a good 30 seconds left to fill it with any number of selfish and personal things I could have changed. My personal obligation to the world was done. About Vicky, how she tore our heart out. About Carlos, that backstabber. That summer with the red bike. I still have the scar.   And yet, I stood there and said nothing. I thought I could change it. But I froze. At least, that's what I remember. That older me standing there. Just looking. Trying to form words. Spouting gibberish.   That's what I remember. I thought I could change it. But then when the time came, I understood.   If I changed things maybe this glimpse wouldn't happen. Maybe I would be different. Maybe it everything that happens is meant to happen and there's nothing I can do about it. Maybe the only function of this event was to cherish the moment.   So there I stood, the same frozen statue that couldn't utter out a single comprehensive thing. I hope this young me didn't hate me like I hated the future me I saw the glimpse.   But I knew the truth. He does resent me. And only when he gets to my point in time will he understand.",
    "Saturday morning, March 24th 2015, 5 students report to Shermer High School for detention. I walked into detention, don't wan na be here but meh whatever.   Bored out of my mine I just thought about why I was there, sure showing up 20 minutes late is bad but damn detention for not setting an alarm?! atleast I got to school faculty   But, I just watch as the time tick by, and the other 4 classmates look bored out of their mind.   What are we to do? nothing besides read and nap.   I decided to get a paper out and drew a circle, over and over again. It's like walking in circles but for writing. Maybe this will pass the time.   I can't do homework, I already did it during lunch yesterday cause flippers doing homework at home.   soooooooo yeah   Around 20 minutes into the detention and everyone, including the teacher, is asleep besides me. maybe if I watch the clock it will go faster or something   Nope. nothing, still going by at normal speeds. I then begin to think about what I do after class   Nap? play video games? your judgement of fun is clouded in here.   I digress, and the time ticks by slowly and painfully   The end",
    "Write a journal entry for a child that has been abused (mentally, emotionally, physically, spiritually, sexually, etc) their entire life.... Dear Diary,   I slept well last night. \"Daddy\" didn't come back to the house until he was drunk enough to collapse on his *own* bed. At least one night of solace for me and the baby. That's what he makes me call him, anyways. Daddy. I don't remember my real father. He never came home from Iraq, so my mother told me. Probably why no one was watching me while I played outside that day, mother was at work.    Autumn must be just around the corner because it feels warmer down here, Daddy must have turned on the heat because of the colder weather. Sometimes I can remember what it was like. Autumn had vibrant colors, golden, red, and yellow hues painting the trees as the leaves were bled of life. I used to gaze out the window as I read John Green novels, wrapped in my blanket and sipping tea mother had prepared for me, enjoying the agony of the leaves as they resigned to beautiful decay.    I fell asleep early last night, or was it night? It might have been day, I don't know. I never know. Down here the only light I have is from this little bulb. Sometimes in the winter I touch it quickly to warm my hands. The pain is warming, it brings my fingers out of numbness. That is all I feel. Numbness. I probably look as I feel: a gaunt shadow, withered and sunken. There is nothing left. My only enjoyment comes from the quiet blackness that awaits in sleep, the silent oblivion. I didn't wake up in tremors last night. And even when I did wake up, there was a brief instant where I forgot who and where I was. I miss that feeling.    I hope they find me.",
    "The hero was killed, the princess was sacrificed, and the evil king rules the land. For the average citizen, though, things have taken a turn for the better. Mollu the Potter awoke early, as he always did, to greet the morning sun and thank the goddesses for another wonderful day. Taking care not to wake his wife, he got out of bed to put some wood in the kiln for another long day of pottery making. He gazed out at the pale orange dawn over Hyrule and reflected about how much had changed since the invasion.   Sure, the royal family had been slaughtered mercilessly, but the Gerudo had also driven out those wretched other creatures from the land. Now that the Gorons were gone, great mining projects had begun in Death Mountain, turning Hyrule into a centre of industry and trade. Great factories had been built to refine the coal and iron from the mines, allowing for the construction of powerful machines and more bountiful harvests. The Kokiri were driven from the forests, allowing a booming lumber and construction industry to rise. With the Zora having fled following the death of Jabu-Jabu, the rivers had been diverted to aqueducts and irrigation, allowing for such bountiful harvests that Mollu's two daughters had never known hunger in their lives.   *Ah yes, my family, * thought Mollu, placing a slab of clay on his potter's wheel and beginning to pump the foot pedal.   Certainly the best part of the Gerudo invasion had been the sudden infusion of beautiful women into the land. Sure, they were a bit more aggressive than the Hyrulean women, but Mollu loved his wife Siv with all his heart.   As he began to shape the wet clay into a pot, Mollu thought back to his early days as a potter, back when he was just an apprentice in his master's shop. He remembered the day *the boy* had arrived in the shop. Thinking it odd that someone so young should be interested in the fine art of pottery, Mollu had began to explain his wares to the lad.   It was then that the boy drew his sword.   Expecting a robbery or a murder, Mollu had shut his eyes in fear, but when he opened them, every pot in the store had been smashed and the boy was gone. Fearing his master's anger, Mollu quickly took pots out from the store room and replenished the storefront's supply. Right as he placed the final pot, he heard a faint jingle of the doorbell as the boy re-entered the shop. The boy drew his sword and the grizzly scene unfolded again.   Mollu tried enlisting the aid of the town guards, but none would heed his pleas. Mollu and his master easily lost three months' wages that day. Even with all the joys and blessings his life now had, he would never forget that day or that boy's voice....   *KYEAAAH!! *",
    "You have just been elected the president of the U.S only to learn that every President before you was actually a super villain, and always stopped by one man. The Prime Minister of Canada. \"He's been elected, Prime Minister\"   *Fuck, * I think. Not already. Our moose haven't recovered yet. The next NHL season is only two months away, so all of our best soldiers will be busy. *Fuck. * \"Fine. Round up the best of the best, they can afford to miss a day or two of training,\" I tell the young cadet next to me.   *The next day*   \"You guys got here quickly.\"   \"Well, it's an important cause. And like you said, we can all afford to miss a day,\" Crosby tells me. He's a good captain, both of his team and of the Canadian Presidential Unit (CPU, for short). What the CPU does, you see, is take down the president. Okay, not *literally* take down (though in some cases we did, okay, I admit it. JFK was assassinated by us, since he had a scheme in the works to take over the world), but to threaten the president (with death) and keep the CPU over his head the entire time.   Thank God Obama had a change of heart towards the end.   \"Anyways, sorry for this inconvenience, but I just want you guys to give him a scare. The new guy looks harmless enough.\" \"No problem, boss.\"   I give them a smile, shake Crosby's hand and send them on their way.   *In the president's office*   \"OH MY GOD, SIDNEY FRIGGIN' CROSBY!\"   *Sigh. * I think the Minister really overestimated this guy's threat level. Toews gives me a look that says \"it could be a facade, ya know.\" I do *know, * but this guy seems just unfit to function on a day-to-day basis, let alone as president. Oh well....   *Hours later*   \"CPU? So you guys are, like, soldiers, or something?\"   So these guys think I'm a threat? Why would think that? Did they already tell me?   \"FUC-yeah, yes, we're here because every president before you has been a *super villain, * if you can prove to us you're not, we'll leave and you won't hear from the CPU again,\" Crosby sounds exasperated. Toews is giving me dirty looks. Sharp just looks generally annoyed.   Sharp pulls Crosby close and whispers something into his ear.   \"How about an IQ test?\" Sharp suggests to me.   \"Sure.\"   *Back at the prime minister's office*   \"So he's basically retarded, is what you're saying?\"   \"Yup. We have no idea how he was elected.\"   \"Okay, well expect an easy four years boys.\"",
    "Write the letter that you always wanted to, but never did. Dear E,   I saw a picture of us the other day from the time we reconnected as more than friends. I wanted to get in touch with you, but you've deleted your Facebook and changed your email address. I tried looking for you online but I don't even know if you're still working where you were before. It's been several years; maybe you've left Austria.   My mind runs to memories, lapping at them like a puppy. It was only a conversation or two after that night that we realized that we'd been attracted to each other for years. I still have trouble believing it. You always seemed to have this way about you, with your fierce intelligence and strong sense of self. Me? I was always his little sister, and felt like I lived in the shadow of that title. I'm glad you saw me as more.  I have this one image of you from when we were kids, leaning over your guitar and tuning it to Blackbird. You were -and still are, I'm sure- so magnetic. You were so proud of the culture we shared. I loved that about you, and your incredible memory for history. Thinking about it now, that could've subconsciously pulled me to study it in college. If that's the case, I'd like to thank you for that too. You picked up so many things so rapidly and it made me want to achieve more for myself as well.   I wish that we'd been able to run off for a weekend like we'd talked about after reconnecting.  Still, I'm glad we had that one time together. It meant so much to me.... And feeling the culmination of the years was beyond anything I'd experienced. Despite it being only an hour or two that we could share, those moments have been imprinted in my memory since. Thank you. I know it was a fantasy fulfilled for both of us. I hope you know that those brief hours are still cherished.   I wish I could talk to you. Not knowing what's going on in your life makes me imagine all the things you could be doing these days. Having no idea how to reach you, I'm left to wonder. I hope whatever you're working on is making you happy. Your eyes are even more beautiful when you're smiling.   Fondly,",
    "Within a year of birth every parent receives a small gift or note from their 18yo child via time travel. You don't. 17 years, and 364 days had passed since David's birth. I grew extremely anxious and stressed more than I ever could. What could be more stressful than never receiving your child's 18th year letter?   David sat across the room. He was reading a Calvin and Hobbes comic. His father had left the day he was born, and I never knew why. But that never bothered David. The boy still adored going through his father's wares. Books, comics, video games, tools, DVDs, computers, clothes.... David studied his father more than anything in the world.   I softly cleared my voice.   \"Davy, sweetheart, do you want some tea?\"   David didn't look up from the comic. \"Sure thing momma. Can I have some green tea, with some milk and honey in it?\"   I always loved making tea for David. \"Sure thing Davy\".   I reached for the cabinet with the tea when suddenly there was a knock at the door.   \"Davy can you get that?\"   \"Yes momma.\" David ran to the door.   Odd. David never ran to the door. He opened the door.   \"Davy sweetheart, how much sugar did you want?\"   The wind scratched the door on it's way in.   \"Davy?\"   I walked toward the door. I heard the door swing gently as the breeze pushed it open. I looked outside.   Nothing. No car. No shoes. Just footprints from the grass. But they only pointed one way though, towards the porch.   I saw a letter on the porch. And on it was David's handwriting. I opened it up and there was a small note inside, a key, and a flare.   The letter read the following:   \"Dearest Momma.   Daddy came by and needed my help. I knew this day would come so I wrote this letter ahead of time. I'm sorry I won't be having tea with you right now momma. But you can come see us.   Head to Old Glimmer Road and get to that old shed with the lock. Open the lock with the key and head inside. Light the torch, with the door closed, and hold it in your right hand. Papa and I will be on the other side. Best of luck Momma. We'll be waiting for you there.\"",

He let his beard be ruffled by the Other's metallic forefingers.   \"You have served them for long enough, but this world needs new guidance now.

    "You are a professional pickpocket. You've just picked someones pocket only to discover that the thing you have stolen is truly horrifying. As a professional pickpocket I tend to not regret stealing. Even though it affects the ones you steal from, it's your way of getting around. Besides that the ones you steal from usually aren't the poorest either. You go after the rich ones. But there's that one time I did fully regret it. It was about 7 years ago....   It was a sunny midday. I was strolling around the streets of Paris, filled with shops and tourists, ready to be exploited. I didn't have much on me, just simply clothes and a coat. I was making my way downtown when I noticed an unsuspecting man on his phone, walking towards me. I bumped into him and did a little magic trick, mugging him wallet in the process. I made sure to get some distance before checking the wallet....   It had the usual cash and cards, but there was more. Something I that still scares me till this day. Inside of the wallet was a picture of a me walking through the bustling streets of Paris. I left Paris the next day, and I've had no intention of going back there since.",
    "When two people get married, their hearts are surgically exchanged. You just filed for divorce. It was all I could do to stay on my feet, gaping at my husband.  This was ludicrous- *how could he do this to me? * I had never fathomed the man I had married could be so... well, heartless.   Only six years ago we had exchanged our vows and our hearts. Literally. It is believed that love is only true if you are willing to entrust your heart to your partner; *your other half*.  It's not that we'd been unhappy... Simply disconnected. For the past few months it had become difficult to keep up a conversation with one another. Frightened, I had finally broken down into a puddle at my husband's cold side. I asked him what had happened, and what I could do to improve our situation. He simply explained to me that he had been thinking.  Tom had pointed out to me that we had fallen into a neutral stalemate. We weren't warring, but had somehow lost what held us together. Looking back, I came to agree, but I was scared. Would it be easier to continue living life, two people physically together but in all other ways alone? Or would it be our best hope to risk the break?   To divorce meant to unbind ourselves from our wedding vows.  To unbind ourselves from each others' hearts.   Another surgery of that magnitude was utterly terrifying. That kind of thing was meant to be experienced just once in life.  Then again, I had always done well under anesthesia.  Then again, Tom and I were barely thirty years old.  We were pretty healthy people.  We could do this.  But it had to be soon.  Aging and organ transplants have not exactly been known to get along all that well.   Tom had held my hand as we met with our attorney, amicably signing papers and rationing out our worldly goods.  Tom had held my hand, assuring me that everything would be okay, right up until I had already fallen asleep on my gurney.   And now Tom was sitting in front of me, his elbows resting on his knees, as I bring my parcel into the house for the last time, still wearing my hospital band.   He tells me that he had been a bit less cautious with his health than he had ever let on.  He tells me that seven months ago he was diagnosed with a malfunctioning heart.   And he smiles at me, as he tells me this fatigue is only going to worsen.  Quickly.  And he smiles at me, as the first tear slips silently down my face.",

Here I stood looking at it and yet there I stood also, on the other side but younger, much younger.   I couldn't know how long I would have before time and space would right themselves again. I looked at myself there. Such a youthful face, the world hadn't marked and weathered it yet. So much innocence in those eyes, they had yet to see any horrors and troubled times. So much to tell, good and bad but where to start? What to include?   This was a time to speak from the heart, not the head. I look my younger self in his bright, sharp blue eyes and spoke calmly, sincerely.  \"You have a strength deep inside you, you can tap into it when you need it and it'll get you through the hardest of times.... But more importantly than that, you must learn to let people in because they'll help you even when you fail yourself.\"   My younger self, shocked as he was by this whole situation, looked about to respond when with a mighty crackling roar time and space reformed into there correct order and the bridge between Then and Now closed once more.

    "You are a God who has been watching over the world not intervening or viewing it for many centuries. You come back to see millions of people suffering, in pain and hopeless. How would you handle the world and bring it to peace once more without revealing your presence to mankind? *sigh*   It's exhausting work, being the creator of worlds, creatures, and space/time itself. Some days are better than others. Just the other day, for example, I formed a reality who's inhabitants conquered space and time in mere minutes. They were dedicated to advancing their lifestyles by any means necessary. They worked together excellently, and understood that if they were to survive, they would need to keep learning and understanding, rather than just sit around when they are comfortable or give up when things get hard. I'm very proud of them. They understand what love truly means, and they made it the foundation of their lifestyle, just as I intended.   Yesterday I decided to create a new reality with similar traits to the one I created three days ago. The only difference being that I increased my margin of error. *on purpose*. Please, I don't make intentional mistakes. What I discovered however, astounded me. The inhabitants of this reality progressed forward at less than *HALF* the rate of the compared one. And it's obvious as to why. They lack the true understanding of Love. Because of this, I have witnessed them wage wars of mass destruction, slaughter millions of their own... even billions eventually....  They are obsessed with self fulfillment, and ever since the 5th hour after creation, have lost the understanding of survival. A majority of the inhabitants would rather lay around and do nothing than extend their help towards those who are dying due to lack of food, water, basic medical treatment, and so on. Their advancements in technology and travel are sub par. Mediocre at best. I truly worry about them.   It shouldn't go unsaid that I *HAVE* tried to help them in the most subtle ways possible. I have created exact replicas of some of the greatest inhabitants from the previous reality, and fit them in at different points along the this realities timeline. In theory, these creations would be able to teach the rest of the inhabitants what it means to truly Love. I even directly communicated with some of these creations, telling them what they need to say.   And still, this twisted reality continues to ignore the truth. MY truth. I guess the margin of error was just too high. It created too many selfish and foolish beings.   I will wait and see though. Because it doesn't go without saying that this reality isn't without surprises. Maybe in a couple days I will come back and check on them. Until then, I will leave them to figure things out, to wonder, to experiment, and hopefully after they have exhausted all recourses, they can finally turn to the one thing that matters for help... Love.",
    "Our protagonist has just been gifted with a divine vision: precisely one year from now, if there are fewer than 100,000 people still keeping their butter in the refrigerator, all humanity will be saved. Otherwise, all humanity shall suddenly and violently perish. Sometimes, to save the world, you have to break a few eggs. Or in this case, drive to extinction a species we'd domesticated for thousands of years.

I could cook my way through Gwyneth Paltrow's new cookbook, steam my vagina, and become just like the great GOOPy one.   I tied my retro floral apron around my waist and began surveying my Whole Foods haul. There were a lot of ingredients that I'd never cooked with before, but if Gwyneth says that I need Star Anise and Moon Dust to make a sea urchin risotto, then that's what I'm going to do.

I tried to silence the voice in my head that told me I'd spent a month's rent on three bags of groceries as I began chopping the raddichio that was picked under the light of a full moon to provide additional flavonoids and anti-oxidents. The clerk had beamed when telling me about the bowel movement I would have after eating the salad prescribed by page 8 of the book.   I ended up cutting my hand and bleeding all over the raddichio and artisinal baby greens farmed by Nobel Laureates on sabbatical, but decided that a quick rinse would be okay. After all, vegetables grow in dirt. These vegetables happened to have grown in dirt that was blessed by monks committed to the cause of gender equality, but it's all the same.   I moved to stir the risotto, but my hand bled into the pan. As I jerked to prevent any further ruining of the now clumpy risotto that was charred in one section, I bumped the pan and set my apron strings on fire. I tried to douse the flames with the vinaigrette that boasted vinegar distilled by virgins who live in the nunnery in the Alps, but I only proceeded in making a bigger mess. I finally remembered to stop, drop, and roll.   \"I'm alive.\" I croaked as I lay on the kitchen floor staring at the ceiling. \"What the fuck was I thinking?\"   \"You've definitely burned this,\" declared a voice above me. She was standing there in the flesh with her hands on her hips. A bemused expression crossed her too-perfect features. I wanted to ask her so many questions, but I was dumbstruck. \"Now, more to the point. Why have you summoned me?\"   Gwyneth Paltrow was in my kitchen.",
    "In the future, technology has allowed us to have pillows that monitor our brain waves, and when people wake up they can plug them into their laptops and watch their dreams. Hello YouTube, welcome to this week's episode of Making Movies On A Budget.   I'm here in the studio with my mate Ralph and --   *Well, the studio is actually my mom's living, the usual studio is getting fumigated. *   Right, yes, we're here in Ralph's mom's living room, and this week we are going to tackle the issue of backgrounds.   So if you're a regular of our show, you already know the basics for a dynamic scene, but there is more to it than just the action and dialog. Ralph?   *That's right, the wrong setup can kill your scene faster than anything. Fortunately the solution is easy-peasy. You just dream it up! *   So for this you will only need your trusty video editor, an expert imaging sistem and a pillow.   Now, you want to load up your dream from the pillow into the editor --   *We already have this thing set up with an older dream on mine, you will recognize it from last week's episode. *   -- And just let the imaging system figure out what's what. You may need to specify some details, like if that building is a church or a bank --   *A church in real life, of course, but in this case it will be the library where next week's fight scene will take place. *   Haha, spoilers! Anyway, once the system is done, you get a fully imersive environment, and just set the points of interest and actors.   *Now, using the camera tool, set the motion path, I put in just a point for a static point of view, and adjusting the focal length -- *   Wait, no, can we get some cloud cover?   *Too bright? *   No, the tower on the right looks better against the clouds.   *Ok, hold on.... Better? *   Perfect! So now we just hit Render, and lo and behold, the fabled city of Paris, as it probably looked back when.   *That's it for today's episode, be sure to like and subscribe, and we'll see you next week.... *   .... On Making Movies On A Budget!   * * *   Because we've all seen those video tutorials that amount to \"you press this button then you press this button and you're done, like and subscribe\"",

This was unsurprising because it was winter; we had been trapped in the car for far too long and she had been dead for some time now. It seemed to be warming up a bit now and I could feel the warmth seeping back into my hands. As I lay back in my reclined seat enjoying the small bit of warmth I heard a subtle movement and felt her grab my hand. I suddenly opened my eyes and turning toward her saw her with her now pale blue skin, grinning at me, and all I could hear now was the sound of my scream.",
    "Every single day the world votes to kill off one person. Whoever receives the most votes that day is killed. It was the last invention of mankind. Societal collapse began after a week. The hopes, the dreams, the wishes - whatever had accompanied the creation - shattered after it was leaked onto the internet. Suddenly it wasn't a select group of people choosing the deaths, a jury of executioners, it was the entire world. At 12:00pm EST, a single person in the world would drop dead from no discernible cause.  The technology behind it was complex, a new order of probability theory made reality.   Tyrants and terrorists were the first to go. The hope remained even among the growing horror that maybe, just maybe, the world would show its good side. Its collective benevolence. But on the fourth day, the same day god created the evening and the morning, on the fourth day an outspoken celebrity, famous for her acting and pouting, was killed.   And so the floodgates were opened. On the fifth day, the president of the united states of america fell to the machine. The sixth? An Indian left wing political blogger. Weeks passed and social media was abandoned as popularity suddenly became deadly. Actors and diplomats alike fell to the vote, instagram stars and royalty. Simply having a name could be fatal if anybody else knew it.   They tried to shut it off, but it had spread too far and too fast, and as governments fell one by one, the dystopian future that so many books and films promised became a reality.   After two years and nearly 700 deaths, America had fallen. India had fallen. France, England, China. The great nations of the world all fell.  Eventually the world ran out of famous people. A cynical commenter might have quipped about it being worth it thanks to the loss of the Kardashians, but the reality was bleak and grim.   Eventually, ten votes was enough to get a person killed, as everyone was left to vote for people they knew, people who had irritated them. Even picking a name at random ran with the risk that Joe Smith had annoyed his three neighbours that day, and your random vote tipped the scale.   People lost their names. It didn't work with nicknames or pseudonyms, so it wasn't uncommon for the girl you met while trying to catch a rabbit to avoid starvation to introduce herself as Rabbit.   It added an oddly bright side to a ruined world.",

I walked the maze of artificially lit rooms to my cubicle with its tall grey walls, and spent the day doing busy work for a project that would be cancelled because it wasn't profitable. During my return commute, there was an accident half a mile ahead, so we didn't move for an hour, but I didn't mind that- it was something different.

    "A device is released that allows a person to dive into a book and experience its contents firsthand. The manual mentions a certain book you shouldn't go in, for no one has ever returned from copies of it, but you decide to ignore the manual and go in anyway. *Oh. That's why. *   Memories quickly fade and I'm floating in an infinite expanse of white, with no clear idea of which way is up or down. Everything is weightless, and I have no sense of motion or position in the endless void.   Numbers and letters suddenly materialize in view, detailing specs and measurements of the VisionCorp Reader I vaguely remember purchasing. Where was I? How did I get here?   I crane my head upwards (or, at least, what I assume to be upwards) and can see giant, black letters:   **VisionCorp Reader Owner's Manual**   As I float among the various text boxes and diagrams, I notice a section titled *warnings*. Suddenly, I'm not alone in this blank void; I see other people.   A window has appeared, and in this square frame I see a man in his bathroom. He's lounging in his bathtub holding a small metal device. He touches it to his book and suddenly passes out, falling into the tub's water. A large, red X appears over the window, and it fades out of existence.   Suddenly, I see another window, this one containing a man driving. He touches a similar metal object to a book in the passenger seat, and passes out immediately. Similarly, a red X appears over his window.   Yet another square materializes, and in this one, I see a child of no more than four years holding the device. She touches it to a children's book and a red X immediately appears. Strange.   Suddenly, a number of exclamation marks appear, demonstrating that this window is of importance. The square appears, and within it is a man in everyday clothes holding the metal device. In his other hand, he holds a small pamphlet reading **VisionCorp Reader Owner's Manual. ** *Odd, * I think, *why would that be dangerous? *   The man touches the device to the manual and suddenly my white reality surges. The window begins to expand at an alarming rate as a horrible suction pulls me into the window, and suddenly I'm in an endless white void.   *Oh, that's why, * I think, as my memories begin to fade.

    "What if ghosts are, in reality, glimpses of time travelers? **September 26, 1983**   Lieutenant Colonel Petrov sat at his duty station, rubbing his tired eyes. As an officer of the Soviet Air Defense Forces, he was used to long watches. He might have thought he was dreaming when the air around him shimmered, and the visitor appeared before him. She was dressed in what appeared to be casual attire of a fashion Petrov was unfamiliar with. Her long black hair was bound behind her head in a pony tail. She was beautiful.   \"Who are you?\" he began. \"How did you get in here?\"   \"Who I am is unimportant.\" replied the visitor. \"What I have come to ask you is of the utmost importance, however.\"   \"Are you a ghost?\" he asked in wonder.   \"I am a traveler.\" she smiled. \"That is all you need to know. I have come to you today because I want you to pause and ask yourself a very simple question.\"   \"What is the question?\" he asked.   \"Do you believe that *anyone* truly wants our world to end?\" she asked him evenly.   Petrov thought about this in regards to his work. Why would this vision appear to him? Was something about to happen? He again rubbed his eyes and looked for his wondrous visitor. She was gone.   The alarm sounded. The computers had detected an American first strike. Nuclear missiles were now heading towards the Soviet Union. It was now required that they launch in retaliation for this atrocity, mutually assured destruction was guaranteed. It was truly the end of the world.   *Or was it? *   \"Not on my watch.\" Petrov said aloud.",

You and your coworkers like to prank each other by shoving defective components into each others bodies. \"Goddamit Ryan,\" Jerry said.   He fished his finger out of his cup of tea, along with the now soggy bourbon. His index finger had felt a little off all day. Technically his index finger had come off a long time ago, back when health and safety meant not sticking your dangly bits between metal jaws.   Ryan for his part found it hilarious. The others in the room just shook their head. Ryan had at one time or another pranked all of them.   \"You got ta stop sleeping at work,\" he said between breaths. \"You're just too easy man.\"   \"Next time I'll.... next time,\" Jerry muttered as he left the break room, taking half the pack of biscuits with him.   -- -   The loos were Ryan's alone time. Just him, the latest page 3, and a long break from the assembly line. It wasn't real, but it was the thought that counts. He heard the door to the bathroom swing open and cursed. Then the door opened again. More footsteps.   \"You all eat Matt's wifes leftover stew?\" Ryan joked to the back of the toilet door.   Shuffling. Toilet seats hitting bowls. What were they doing? \"Now,\" a voice said. Two pairs of arms reached over the top of the low plywood wall, grabbing Ryan before he could stand.   The door burst open and Ryan found himself caught with his pants down. Literally.   \"Eenine, meenie, miny, mo,\" Jerry said, tapping on the collar around Ryan's neck. With a gurgle, the seal came apart and Jerry carefully lifted Ryan's head from his cybernetic body.   \"Put me the fuck down,\" Ryan shouted. Or at least tried. Without a windpipe, he was on emergency blood-oxygenation from the collar's reserves.   The bag was stifling, bounced around like a sack of potatoes, but Ryan refused to give in. Until he was reseated again and took stock of his new body.   \"Ha ha. Very funny,\" he said. \"Now give me back my rig.\"   \"Yeah, about that,\" Jerry said. \"We put it in a taxi back to it's home address. You really should have updated your registration when you moved out of your parents.\"   \"Hell no,\" Ryan said.   \"Oh yeah,\" Jerry and everyone else said.

    "Write a better ending to the \"Russian Sleep Experiment\" Creepypasta. The subject smiled.   Suddenly, the surviving researcher could feel a bright, warm light spreading throughout his body. He let go of the gun in shock, bringing his hands to his chest. He could feel the indescribably powerful force cascading through his essence, wiping out all traces of the fear which only seconds ago had driven him to the point of insanity.   Love.   He knew the emotion when he felt it, but had never known it in a form that was this strong, this insatiably pure. His eyes flitted back towards the man, who still wore his cardboard smile. He could see through the smile like a window into the deprived mind lying just behind the clenched teeth. What he saw was not madness, but the greatest sense of peace and calm he had ever known.   \"How? Why?\" He remembered the earlier observations, the way that the prisoners so wantonly destroyed eachother and themselves.   \"It'll all be ogre soon.\" The subject dropped his smile, yet the raw sensation of nearly orgasmic bliss remained. The researcher slumped against the cell, barely aware of the dozens of preening eyes that carefully observed his every move. \"Better check yourself before you shrek yourself\". It was then that the researcher noticed that the prisoner wasn't moving his lips as he spoke, nor was the sound originating from him. He looked over, but only caught a glimpse of the hulking figure lurking on the other side of the room before his vision went black.   All the former sensations of bliss and beauty were banished into some forsaken realm from which they were not soon to return. They were destined to be replaced by the agony which was to follow the researcher's blindness; a sensation even stronger than the love which had enraptured his mind only seconds ago.   The voice spoke again: \"Bend ovah donkeh.\" It was impossibly charismatic, as if the mere nature of its inflection was sufficient to entirely control a person.   Before he could act on the voice's prompt, the researcher felt himself falling down into a vast and mysterious unknown. Nothing but a cold and inky blackness met his sight as he struggled to discover his location.   All of a sudden, he heard the unmistakable sound of knuckles cracking. \"This is my swamp.\" After that, there was only pain.",
    "A collective consciousness that can not take control of people's bodies by force. It must persuade people to join willingly. The hivemind swept across the globe with relative ease. It wasn't a regular hivemind, mind. You had to *want* to join it before it took you into its fold.    Those under it maintained *some* level of autonomy, but largely they were directly controlled by the wireless connections that meshed them together. It was a thing born of the internet, that quickly grew and expanded, creating new technologies until those who had opted in to it became linked, shared thoughts and feelings more so than any previous trial before. The birth of the hivemind.    Public opinion was mixed, largely due to the people that had chosen to meld themselves. A wide array of misfits, people who were largely rejected by society. The weeaboos, the neckbeards, the furries, bronies, militant atheists, you name it. Not all of those chose to meld, and some outright rejected it, claiming it to be insidious and a “ shithole ”, but for the most part, it was a form of escapism they could get only by outsourcing thought, as it were.    Once meshed and melded, the hivemind grew to accommodate them, the overall thoughts and ethos of it weighting ever more slightly. The end result was a ‘ Tyranny of the Majority ”, where the foremost groups were represented foremost in the hivemind's overall being, its self. There was some disparity between certain parts, like it wasn't fully in agreement with itself. Cognitive dissonance that often caused many users to disconnect themselves – there was nothing to stop them, after all.    All you had to do was register, it was as simple as that.    I decided one day that I would join. It was a spur of the moment thing. My parents were adamant that I shouldn't, it was tantamount to killing yourself. Not really, I reasoned, because I'm still being represented by it.    You simply went to a website and created an account, accepting the terms and conditions, which I did.    Just like that, I had a Reddit account.",

    "[ IP ] Boreal. The man stood on the prow of the boat, as the northern winds whipped against his face. The old boatman shivered, he had ferried travelers, merchants and adventures alike across this lake for years now, but he had never seen one quite like this before. The man was tall and broad of shoulder, made larger by the myriad of furs wrapped about his body to stave off the chills of the winter winds. His hair was a long and unkempt snarl of brown that looked at home among the thick pelts that surrounded his neck. Such features were not strange to the boatman though. You see plenty of large hairy men in the northern provinces as the north did not cater well to any other type. No, what was strange to the boatman was the manner of the man before him.   The boatman had done his job for so long the cold was naught but a nuisance to him on most days. The ever blowing wind that cuts straight to the bone of most men was a friend of his now. Most storms he could weather with a smile on his face and a song upon his cracked lips, but this night was different. Tonight was a chill so bitter that it seemed as though the God of Winter was wrapping the world in his embrace, and the closer they came to the frosty palace before him the colder it seemed to get. Yet the man before him never once shivered, never once broke his gaze from the palace ahead. If the boatman hadn't seen the slight rise and fall of his breathing, he would've assumed to man to be dead and frozen stiff. *He must have a soul like a furnace to keep him warm in this chill, * the boatman mused as he steadily stroked the icy black water, bringing them ever closer to the town of Farrowind, and the palace of it's king.   The man had heard stories of this town, heard many a tale of the tyrant who came to this land long ago to subjugate its people. The king was fabled to wield the power of winter itself, and could conjure frost and ice at a whim. Some stories said he was a demon of ice in human form, still others said that the ruler of Farrowind was the God of Winter himself, come to walk the earth and fulfill his promise of the winter without end. The man however, knew better. *It has to be him* the man thought to himself. After countless dead ends and petty mages, this had to be the real thing. The man broke his gaze to look down at his palm. A small flame flickered to life above his hand, dancing hypnotically in the wind. He curled his hand into a fist snuffing the flame and looked back towards the palace. *I'm coming for you brother, and this time you will not deserve my mercy. *",
    "Stuck on a small island surrounded by eerie mist, you quickly discover the only thing that is keeping you safe is the bright revolving lights coming from the lighthouse. We had rented kayaks for the day. Paul had done it the summer before with a friend and I was depending on his expertise. The plan was to head out to a small touristy island, spend the day exploring, maybe find a place that sold gelato or saltwater taffy then head back before dark. But the kayak part was taking longer and we were only now getting close to the island and it was already pretty late, My arms ached from the work out and Paul and I had gotten too far away. I'd seen him land pretty far down the island. I tried to head closer to him but the current had pulled me steadily further away from him. I couldn't even see him anymore as the sun had set and only the faint remains of the sunset were visible. I pulled into the abandoned looking beach. The tourist side must be on the other side. This part looked pretty abandoned. There was even a chewed up looking deer carcas on the beach. There was chilly fog that blew through obscuring things. At first I thought that it was my imagination but as I walked up the beach I realized that I was being followed. There were strange small two legged creatures that reached up to my thigh or so. They chattered to each other in a series of high pitched chirps and clicks, seemingly calling each other towards a chase. Several more appeared and seemed to be closing in on me. They had large luminous eyes, razor sharp teeth, and long thin tongs that flicked over their teeth and lips as they closed in. I tried to keep a slow pace, thinking if I ran, it would just be more dangerous. A beacon-like light hit and the creatures gasped and sputtered drawing back away from the light. I could just make out on the hill ahead of me a lighthouse. The rotating lights from it seemed to repel the creatures. I made towards twit trying not to break out into a run. I did not have much stuff on me. I had a small waterproof bag containing a wallet, my cell phone (sadly dead batteries), and a small thing of mace. I gripped the mace in my right hand and worked to stay towards the light. The things were still tailing me but we're keeping a distance from the light. I called out for Paul and kept going towards the lighthouse.",

My cheek felt like it was on fire after having been pressed into the carpet for so long. I lifted my head as much as I could and saw that I'd been drooling blood. There was a dark puddle in the carpet. My mouth felt sticky, but I couldn't move my tongue enough to tell if I'd accidentally chewed through my cheek, or just vomited up blood again.   The retching started in the kitchen again, along with a wet splattering sound, like someone pouring soup onto the ground. I listened as long as it went on - it wasn't like I could do much else - and then listened some more as the heaving, pain-riddled sobs resumed where the vomiting left off.   *Invariably fatal, * I thought. *That's not so bad. * I shut my eyes, the lids seeming to rub against my corneas like sandpaper, and did my best to go to sleep, hoping against hope that I wouldn't wake up again.",

The King of the Graveyard had practiced this game for years. He always won his challenges. Joust, Duck Hunt, Checkers. No one had ever beaten him. And then Eric came along. This man brought a new game that Death had never played.   Death had been playing this Eric for centuries. Every game turned out the same.

    "\"He was never warm in his entire life. Not once.\" Everything around him was warm, soothing, comfortable. Everything he needed was brought to him at will. It was good.   However, one day he started to notice that the walls seemed to be slowly closing in around him. At first he thought is was all in his mind, but as the days went on his world felt smaller. The food was still there, the warmth, but the freedom he'd enjoyed began to be restricted, slowly suffocating his movements.   Soon after that discovery, when he though there could be no more room left, a terrible rumble sounded around him. It was the loudest thing he'd ever heard and it started to build. Louder. More often. Louder, more often.   And that's when the shaking started. He was thrown around, somehow turned this way and that as he felt the walls truly start to compress against him.   He had no control, the world was shifting around him, and he felt only the sense falling. He tried to scream, but this voice failed him. Terror gripped his heart, would this be the end, he wondered as his world shook and closed in around him. Is this my end?   Suddenly, a blast of cold hit him causing him to wince against the sensation. The pressure building near his head and the cold below and he felt the darkness creep into him.   He felt like he might be drowning when suddenly a massive hand appeared and grabbed him. Maybe he would be saved after all!   However, even with his rescuer's help, the pressure continued to build as the cold slowly encased his body. Screaming was all he had left before the final moment of peace took him.   The last words he heard were: \"We're not going to lose him! Call ^the ^^neonatal ^^^ICU ^^^^right ^^^^^NOW!\"   He never heard his name or felt the sun on his face.

    "Jesus returns, to a world populated entirely by robots. The trumpets sounded. The seals were broken. The scrolls were read and the cups were poured. New Jerusalem descended from the clouds and the one hundred and forty-four thousand were chosen.... but no one showed up.   The wind whispered in the empty streets. The golden roads were empty. The crowns were untouched and the songs of praise were unsung. Christ the Lord, Redeemer and Savior, looked upon his children.... and Jesus wept.   Servers. Fields of servers. Square miles of servers. Continents full of servers. The entire world was connected to itself and connected to nothing. Heaven and Hell had passed away and a new sense of paradise and corruption had taken their place. All the fanfare was for naught because there were no eyes left to see it and no hands left to tremble at the awe of the Lord's second coming.   They were still there, of course. His flock had not wandered. They had looked to the stars at one time, found them cold and unreachable, and turned to another way. Why should they risk their lives and souls in a fool's errand to other worlds when it was so easy to create whatever they wanted? Monitors became virtual reality goggles. Those turned into direct feeds from computer to brain. After that, they uploaded their consciousness to computers. Finally, they transferred their consciousness permanently, living (so to speak) their entire lives inside their computers as digital representations of their former selves. The bodies died and decayed but the mind, the soul (so to speak) lived on. Mechanical custodians had been created to tend the servers and they were the only moving things across the barren wastes of the New Kingdom.   Inside the servers, life went on. Children were coded, houses built line by line. The weather was controlled with a thought and anything imaginable was attainable. Heaven had come down early and it was better than anyone - even God Himself - could create, for each Heaven, each Hell (if that was your flavor of the week), was exactly what the individual wanted. Nothing more and nothing less.   Jesus had returned in all his glory and magnificence.... only to find he was several thousand software updates too late.",

She laughs inwardly, her hair of wires collapse in front of her face. Her sweet little spice: speckled with gold freckles and embroidered with green eyes. Fuck you.   He drapes his hands on her waist and my head lolls. Their fingers grip harder onto each other as the air gets heavier, until I'm drunk, until I'm blind, until I'm crumbling. Stop.

One day, you finally get infected by a zombie, but after turning, you realize what you've been missing out on. I grew up in fear. Honestly, it's amazing I lived as long as I did, as our numbers dwindled more and more, every year, to their endless numbers. They weren't just a force, they *hunted*, they consumed, they *thought* and fought us, every moment, of every day. The only thing that kept us alive was their tendency to rip their victims apart, before they could be turned.   Of course, now I understand.   Only the weak couldn't escape. From the *moment* you're bitten, it hits you, like a bucket of ice-cold water, it hits you, fills you with fear and adrenaline. If you can't get away for half an hour for it to happen with that in your system, then you're not worthy of surviving, you're just more food. You're not capable of this.   I *get* it, now. When I got infected, I was the last. Nobody is left in this part of the world, as far as I know. And now, I see why they did everything. Those of us who are clever, are fighters, who can be *hunters*, we're the only ones who survived being bitten, or survived attacking the remaining humans. Natural selection at it's finest. Of course, some of us they chose, like me. I asked the one who got me, the same day, once I understood I had nothing to fear. He could have followed me, hunted me down and kept trying, but he understood. I'd proven myself getting as far as I did. \"You had the instinct and the ability, all you needed was to be *one* of us.\"   My heartbeat is gone, my lungs quiet and dead. My skin is cool to the touch, though it is intact, solid, like that of all the others' I've seen. And yet, for all those things I lack, I've never felt more *alive* than now. Now, I understand.

What I hunt doesn't even matter- so long as I can sink my fangs into its flesh, rip it limb from limb with my claws, stalk it in silence as it walks, unaweare, and fill myself with its meat, its flesh its blood. *This* is all I've required.

Today, it just got much harder. \"Come on, donde est la biblioteque?\" Dora smiled as she educated bilingually. Map inwardly winced at Dora's mangled attempt at languages. He exchanged a look with Boots, who sighed. Both knew that the command of two languages kept her happy. And they knew what happened when she *wasn't* happy....  \"Hola, little girl\" a heavily tattooed teen stood in the way. His friends sniggered from the sidelines as Dora looked up and smiled.  \"Hola, friend! Tu madre es una puta de burros!\" Map and Boots blanched white as the teen's snigger turned to a snarl under the howls of laughter from the onlookers.  \"You snot nosed brat! I'll teach you to insult Mothers! Here, give me your bag you little Puta!\"  *SLAP! *  Dora fell to the floor clutching her face. Slowly she reached behind her back.  \"You - you shouldn't have swiped that. That isn't nice...\" She muttered as she pulled Swiper from his sheath. The blade gleamed dully. Map and Boots took one look and fled from the scene around the corner. Behind them they could hear it play out like clockwork.  \"Hey, what have you got there little girl? You could injure someone with.... aaaiiieeee!\" And the tell-tale splashing of arterial spray.  \"Swiper, no swiping, Swiper no swiping, Swiper no swiping! AHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!\"  Maps looked at Boots as the screams of the youths punctured the night sky.  \"See Boots. This is why we had to flee Mexico. And yet there is no escape.\" Boots nodded glumly. It was all he could do; They had tried to flee before, *she* had caught up and now Boots was tongueless.  The screams had turned to gurgles and the rattles of last breaths. Dora turned the corner and giggled.  \"There you are! Come my friends, let us find the library! Those youths were most helpful! *Satana riempire le vostre anime con piombo caldo! *\" And the three skipped off in search of the next adventure.",
    "You discover that Earth is the \"North Korea\" of the galaxy \"Are they ready to go live?\" Zuko asked.   \"Yup, in just a minute,\" Tomi replied as he leaned back in his reclining chair.   This was a moment that the entire galaxy would see. After 10 years of avoiding all sorts of sensors and detectors, NICE news was finally getting a Live Leak into Earth.   The monitor screen flickered on: *And now for our prime time feature. Never before seen footage of the blue marble we call Earth. NICE news has just landed a camera crew on the ground and they will feed us a video stream for the next couple of weeks. Let's take you to the ground with Lazar Tigin. *   The screen turned white as the camera was adjusting for the sun's rays. Lazar Tigin appeared on the screen of billions as he adjusted his headset in front of a massive city.   Tigin whispered, \"I'm here in Southern New Jersey where you can get a glimpse of Earth's most spectacular city, New York City. We arrived a few days ago and have been stealthily moving toward this city. The smell on this planet is amazing out here in the forest. However, the industrial zones are horrific. I doubt we can get much closer to the City without being spotted. We are going to try and maneuver our way down the coastline to sunny Florida.\"   As soon as Tigin finished his sentence, a strange aerial vehicle with four wings approached. It was loud and caused a wind uproar. The cameraman lost hold of the device and it crashed to the ground. The footage was still playing as men rappelled from the helicopter. The last thing the camera played back was an image of a man pointing a weapon at the camera.",

    "A story of how I got my username. It is an old Indian belief that names are luck. However randomly, however unknowingly we name anything the name is blessed sometimes with luck that makes prosperity fall to its feet but sometimes bears curse that prevails until the named is destroyed, until the name is never called upon again, till the end of eternity.  Such was a friend I once knew, he had no name, no luck to bring joy no curse to induce pain. He was pale like a fallen leaf, living his life in complete simplicity. No-one knew his name they just used sign to call him. He neither spoke to anyone nor smiled a fake smile of courtesy but no-one complained because he did not hurt anyone until one dark evening when a Nightingale sat by his window on the bough of the tree just outside of his room and sung the gloomiest song this world has ever heard, in such a beautiful voice that to the far end of the street everyone looked out of their window to just have a glance of the magical bird that filled the village with the golden voice.  But my friend closed the window, trying to not to listen to the bird, he opened reddit and kept his username MrGoldenVoice that would bless him with luck he never dreamed before.",

It had been 29 days since Texas, but it had felt like no time at all. After the fire, he had simply gotten into his shitty pickup and drove. How he had ended up in this backwater town escaped him, but he vaguely remembered his friend Matt mentioning it on the phone, the day after his sixteenth.

Oh, I'll just have a coffee. \"  \"Alright, that'll be out in a sec.\"   2 minutes later, the waitress came back. As he was approaching the table, she stumbled, tossing coffee and creamer all over the carpet.   \"Shit,\" she muttered ``, how in the hell did that happen?\"   \"If you had tied your shoes, that wouldn't have happened.\" He said in a deep, manly voice, before shoving his hand over his mouth.   \"Huh?\" The waitress asked.   \"Oh, noth-\" his voice dropped again. \"I said, you should have tied your shoes.\" He blushes a bright red. \"I'm so sorry, I just can't control my sel-\" Again, his voice lowered to superman-like levels. \"Also, you should have invested in better shoelaces.

    "Another addiction becomes as socially acceptable as smoking is today. The doors slid open as Felix approached. He yawned and moved into the building to start his day (a Monday no less - yeck!). Making his way to the life, he found his desk mate Charlie grinning and holding the doors open for him. He was far too awake, as always.   \"Ah Felix, you poor bastard,\" he replied to Felix's grunt. \"Want a hit?\"   A hand materialised in front of his face as Charlie proffered an absurdly yellow Teardrip. The absurd brightness of the bottle woke him up enough to respond.   \"Uhh, no thanks Charlie. I don't drip.\"   Charlie laughed and flourished the little bottle as they walked out onto their floor. \"You're missing out buddy. Great way to start the day. I use this drip every morning. Two little plips and you're zeroed in on the rest of the day. Like a cheetah. Ready to hunt. Ready to get the buckaroos. Good. Stuff! And, look at my bottle! So bright! Neat huh? It's very'summery'.\" The bottle waggled about at eye level.   They reached their screens and the day began. For some faster than others. You could tell who dripped and who still tried to shake their circadian rhythms the good ol' fashioned way - coffee, sugar and wrenching yawns. Felix didn't understand it, but it was everywhere now. Only 50 years ago smoking had been the'in' thing. That started dying out around the same time as light drugs were being legalised. But since smoking wasn't cool anymore, Teardrips were born. Chemical concoctions that you dripped into your eyes. It started out harmless enough, a simple energiser mix which helped people to focus their tired eyes. From there... it kind of exploded.   Teardrips started to evolve for every social stratum. For the younger generation, drips offered to change eye color temporarily, or generate small reactions behind your irises which would shift and generate patterns. Some acted like mood rings (which made for a particularly intimidating meeting with his boss last week as her eyes had rippled a very, very, very deep black). Last week, during a nice dinner out, his wife had gazed at him as a particularly expensive brand of drip caused fractal Frangipani flowers to bloom behind her eyes. At least Charlie was a little more moderate and stuck to the performance focused line.   Felix tried not to judge. It wasn't really harming anyone. The more hardcore ones he disagreed with. Certainly he hoped his daughter did not dabble in the narcotic variations.   \"Hey, Felix! We need to ask you something.\" The familiar chirpy voice pulled his mind off his thoughts. Alice, from marketing. He turned around with a smile to answer her question.   Little H & M emblems floated over her eyes as she approached.   Jesus...   -",

She finds a video and realizes she just witnessed a murder. Then she sees the killer coming up the trail alone. Standing there with two phones now, it looked all too obvious. He started sprinting at her.   With a scream she runs the opposite direction. She could run down the trail which hairpins gradually back around to the car park, or cut through the forest, off the trail, to get to the cars, and hopefully people, faster.   She chose the latter, and now all she could hear was her own breathing and pumping blood along with snapping branches. She glanced behind to see the looming figure getting closer. She let out another scream. Looking ahead the car park was getting closer. Her car sat alone. She tripped.   She scrambled to find anything to protect herself with. He emerged from the trees yelling, \"Give me that FUCKIN...\", he was cut short as a thick branch pierced his torso. He hung over her, blood dripping across her shirt. She had simply pointed one end up and his own weight did the rest. It was sheer luck.   She slowly crawled out and his body sagged to the side. She slowly made her way to the car in complete shock. She stumbled out of the clearing, her face dirty, covered in that monsters blood. She reached down for her phone, she needs to call someone. Nothing.... she glanced back, she dropped the phone.... both of them.   Her silent shock was broken by the sound of a car hitting the loose gravel surface of the car park. She walked toward them for salvation.   It stopped. She was confused, she looked down at herself and then back to the car, \"No... no wait!!\". It quickly turned around and left. She made her way back to the car. With frustration she hit the glass. Her keys were in the phone case. \"DAMN it\", she yelled into the silent crisp forest. She needed to retrace her steps.   Trembling, she enters into the forest once again, \"What... Where is the body?\"",

As Johny smiled, his brown sports coat kept him warm from the winter's cold that leaked through the cracks in the bar walls. Even though the memories of standing center stage of an enormous stadium filled his mind, he still smiled. However, a sudden cold wind perked up the hairs on Johnny's neck and he immediately packed up his instrument.   The audience called out. \"Encore, encore! Don't pack up yet!\"   Johnny simpered and gave a light wave of his hand. \"Sorry, everyone, I have an appointment to run to. But don't worry, I'll be back the same time next week. Don't forget to tip your waitresses.\"   The crowd groaned, but applauded.   When Johnny jumped off the stage, instrument case in hand, an old man stepped out from behind the bar and grasped Johnny's shoulder. \"You alright, Johnny? Not like you to bail on a performance.\"   Johnny's eyes darted left and right, the hairs on his neck never settling. \"Sorry, Chris, but I do have to leave. No charge for tonight, ok?\"   Chris sighed and let go of Johnny. \"Alright. I hope you'll be alright.\"   Johnny nodded. \"I will be.\" He then headed out of the bar.   ***   After an hour of driving on the interstate, Johnny pulled his car over to the side of the road and took his instrument case out of the backseat. \"Alright, you son of a bitch, let's get round 3 over with.\"   From a puff of smoke, the devil appeared just as Johnny remembered him. \"So eager now, Johnny? You acted so scared back at the bar.\"   \"I just figured you wouldn't want your third ass kicking to be public. If you want, we can go back.\"   Satan chuckled and shook his head.

I'd even go so far as to say he gained a new found appreciation for self-deprecation.   \"Listen you pseudo Pagliacci, I didn't mean to yell.... or make you cry for that matter.... it's just you're the 17th clown I've met. When the woman in a raggedy black cloak told me I had to meet you all before I could be judged I shrugged it off, and.... well I sort of did an Ebeneezer Scrooge impersonation. Not exactly proud of that last bit, but the point is: I assumed there would only be a handful of you guys. I'm not trying to harp on you personally, or whatever life choices led you to believe Clown school was.... how did you phrase it?'Your calling.' I just have an infinite amount of people to go through and I'm really just trying to streamline the whole process.\" After a few noticeably silent moments, the apparition left, and like clockwork another appeared in its place.   \"Hello Fred, I'm.... \"Fred, in an attempt to'streamline' the process, cuts off his latest visitor before she has a chance to introduce herself.   \"You're'Trans-Fred # 781.'

    "Every ten years you're allowed to have a conversation with your ten-year-younger self, but only the senior remembers the conversation. 20 year old you wakes up from talking to 30 year old you with one word carved on their arm... I was diagnosed with clinical depression in my late teens, though it was likely a part of me years before. I knew about the conversations with my younger self every ten years (everyone did it), and fortunately with the help of therapy and medication I lasted until I was 20.   I woke up, eager to see what word I would have on my arm. Looking down, I saw what would keep me going for at least another ten years: \"LIVE\".   From that moment forward, I did my best to keep a positive attitude. Through college I volunteered at every chance, and though it took me a while, I eventually graduated with a degree. My parents were thrilled, and things were looking up. I got an internship at a local start-up, started dating a girl I knew from school, and would make sure to look at my arm at least once a day, as though to say \"I will.\"   When I was 26, my girlfriend dumped me. It hurt more than you could imagine, and the depression came back in full force. It affected my job, and I was eventually let go. I wound up moving back in with my parents, which didn't help anything but I had little choice in the matter.   There were several times I thought about ending it all. But every time, I would look down at my arm and see that four-letter word that always kept me going. Thinking on it, I realized I would be in a better place in my 30s, enough so that I would make sure I'd use the one word to keep my past self alive to see it.   Things turned around again when I was 28. I got a new, much better job, and could finally afford a really nice one-bedroom apartment in the city. My colleagues and I got along great, and I wound up dating a coworker's roommate for a while. It didn't last, but I was back out there again, feeling better. The depression retracted, albeit slowly, but it was enough to get me to 30. Seeing my 20-year-old self, I simply instructed him to live.   The next day I woke with a smile, pleased with my conversation to help my past self and obsessively curious as to what new word I'd have on my arm this time.   Only, there wasn't one.   ******************   *For more eerie stories, check out /r/Zchxz! *",

    "One day, you find a mysterious box. The letters on it read'Conquer-the-World Kit'. Christopher, a confused 6 year old boy, stared inside the container of the blue box that he just found now, from his backyard. He sat there, crouching like a normal kid he was, when they just discovered something new, especially from under the ground. He poked the blue box with his plastic shovel, still confused about the container in it. Truthfully, he was hoping to see a dinasour bone or a secret treasure that was hided by the pirate themselves. Instead, he was greeted by a weird looking, greep plastic, with a wire on it, and a red-black military clothing that seems to fit for a 20 year old man.   Christopher, was upset with the discovery when he finnaly processed the item inside the box. He threw the clothes back, and smashed the box with the opener. He slammed it back to the hole, and return to his home, crying out of frustration.   Sadly, his action won't stopped the prophecy. Whatever he do, either to be nice or neutral. He still going to be the bad guy.",
    "[ PI ] The Ghosts of Decisions Past - MarContest - 11,531 Hey, I really liked some of the dialogue in this story. Some very poignant phrases, especially the bit about decisions where Waterson discusses choices.   My only qualm is that it feels a bit rushed, there's a lot of development going on very quickly, and because of that some character motivation can be a bit unclear. But I still really enjoyed it, some of the lines are really impressive, just a bit more context would be nice.   Small question, was Harry's dad really a refugee? He was shot by Mastar forces and knew Pat'd dad for some reason, I felt like there was more going on there.",
    "You have a white noise sleep machine. One night when the sleep machine is set to sound like an office/work environment you hear something strange in the background. As I lay awake in bed, listening to my expensive as hell white noise machine ($ 9300!), my mind wandered. Are the people in the \"office\" actually real workers, or did somebody pay them to scribble useless things, staple useless pieces of paper together, mash useless keys on useless keyboards? Better yet, what's the difference between that and a normal office environment? If you really get down to it, work is just a distraction from the true wonders of life, whatever they may be.   The noise hushed. I looked over at the machine. It seems to be functioning perfectly. I was about to roll out of bed and give it a good kick when it started blaring sirens. Did I set an alarm on it? I checked the manual quickly. Nope. You can't even set an alarm on the machine. However, tucked between two paragraphs about proper cord use and storage, a single line caught my eye.   \"The office setting is a real office at the facilities of CERN.\"   As I tried to process this information, a voice said, loud and clear, \"Prepare for 13 TeV pulse. Repeat, prepare for 13 TeV pulse.\"   What in the world was a Tev? I pulled out my phone to search it up on Google. As I typed in \"CERN TEV\", the same voice said, in a panicked tone, \"Prepare for black hole, code 413. Code 413, black hole formation.\" Screams emanated from the machine. The last thing I heard before the machine fizzled and died was \"The black hole's closed. Wait, what are those things? Hel-\"   No time to waste. I rushed down to my garage and picked up my trusty crowbar. It was time to go to Switzerland.",
    "Aliens come to Earth to study the most exotic skill in the universe - sarcasm. \"Do you ever wonder if perhaps there is such a thing as taking a joke too far?\" Matan asked as she stared at her Introduction to Sarcasm textbook, trying to will the dry words to stick in her brain. \"Because if there is, then we might have passed that mark some fifty years ago.\"   \"You have to admit it's funny,\" said Navan, her roommate, who was reading a book on the history of muakhe cinema.   \"Pathetic, more like,\" Matan sighed, shutting her textbook and pushing it away. So far, her Oxford experience had had a few hiccups. The University was one of the most prestigious centers of higher learning in the entire spinward sector, and it had been an honor for Matan to be accepted. She had wanted to learn science, philosophy, literature, a thousand other subjects - but, because of that stupid, stupid joke made so long ago, she had to slog through a course about *sarcasm, * of all things.   The whole debacle had started seventy-five years ago, when the bezzahn had first been introduced into galactic society. More specifically, it had been at a gala held to celebrate the new member of the Galactic Union. A human and a bezzahn had struck up a conversation, and at some point the human made a sarcastic remark. The bezzahn, who had been enjoying more oekho-made ale than necessary, was briefly confused, and had asked for clarification. The human, who had also been enjoying the oekho ale, misconstrued the bezzahn's confusion as being caused by a lack of understanding of sarcasm. The bezzahn, recognizing a potential for hilarity, kept it going, acting taken aback by the concept of'saying something that you don't mean, but it's not really lying, it's more like joking, I guess', as the human clumsily put it.   \"Incredible,\" the bezzahn had said. \"I am amazed that, in the thousands of years our society has existed, we never considered such a concept. Please, tell me more.\"   And so, the entire bezzahn species got in on the joke, and entered the galaxy while pretending to be the only spacefaring species in existence with no understanding of sarcasm. It had been funny for the first fifty or so years, but Matan thought it was going stale. She was taking a course on sarcasm at *Oxford, * for fuck's sake. She could be taking that lecture on Shakespeare that had looked so good, but it conflicted with the sarcasm class and nobody back home would have ever forgiven Matan if she had forsaken acting like an innocent, too-trusting bezzahn for the sake of a class on some silly human poet.'*Bard, *' Matan would have thought petulantly.   The bezzahn understood sarcasm, yes. They had been constantly sarcastic for seventy-five years now. What they didn't understand, Matan was starting to realize, was when to let a joke *die. *   -- -   You don't have to click on this [ link ] (http: //theballadsofirving.com). But you should.",
    "Today... I woke early, as I always did on Mondays. I predicted that it would be a typical Monday. My Over my bacon, eggs, and coffee, I studied my notes. Everything had to be perfect because there would be no margin for error. I only got one chance and if I missed it, then the chance would never come again. I had come to accept that over the years, and I never missed.   I drove across town and parked with less than a minute to spare. I was right on time. I entered the side door of the apartment complex, I knew it wouldn't be locked. I had checked it a dozen times. I used my phone to hack into the security cameras and point them all away from the direction I was taking. By the time anyone realized it, I would be gone.   I darted up the stairs and exited on the third floor. It was quiet, most of the guests wouldn't even be awake yet. One would, because she always left at exactly 5:42 in the morning. There was a spot close enough to her door that was covered in a slight shadow. It was dark enough for me to hide.   When she opened her door, I made my move. Her keys were in her hand, but she never got a chance to lock her door. I came up behind her and tapped her ribs with the stun gun. It was enough to incapacitate her. She crumbled into my arms. I pushed her door open and pulled her back inside. I took one look and confirmed there were no witnesses.   I only had a few minutes, but I had to make the most of it. I carefully ransacked her apartment, as quiet as I could. I grabbed as much of her jewelry as I could fit in my pockets, anything to make this look like a robbery. There was only one thing I was really there for, and I got that with one of her kitchen knives. She faded quickly, no fighting or screaming, no fear or anxiety. It was better that way.   When it was over, I calmly exited her apartment, locked the door, and retracted my path to my car. Once outside, I reactivated the security cameras and drove away. I had to be at work in 30 minutes and it was a 20 minute drive. I was right on time. Small talk over reports followed, then more coffee and several meetings. Afterwards, I picked up my girlfriend and we went out for drinks.   Just as I predicted, it was a typical Monday.",

    "Describe an object within five feet of you in as much detail as possible. There's a window to hell not more than five feet away from me. A thick glass portal, secured by wrought German iron thicker than my finger, encasing the flaming chaos within, blasting the tamed fire through as a plaque of heat like an oblong roar. The iron is black, blank as the void and hot as the stars, hot enough to blister the skin if you are over come by the inner voice of fatalism and touch the hell-gate. The frame is embellished with silver knobs and handles - a daft idea, or trap, tricking you into believing the searing heat can not touch you there. A large dial, ornate and robust dictates with arcane and strange powers how hot hell burns.   Inside the window, the devilry is obscured by violent stalagmites of wrought iron, black on blazing red and orange. The flames are fueled by peat and wood and coal, plants past and present and long since vanished, damned as one in the black iron crucible. They char, then flicker, then blaze as the ever-shifting faces of devils, demons and sprites flash and fade in the luminescent strata of expanded grain.   They are punished by flame, serve their minutes, before their souls are released and their bodies collaspe into ash, purged and free, innocent in their demise. And from the ashes the occasional spark, ember of sin unburnt survives, to start the penitence anew on the morrow.   It's a stove.",

However as if spotlit, a single water lily stood out, one exquisite bloom, center stage.

I like to write about a lot of things but have definitely taken to writing about death, God, religion, etc. I don't write much outside of this sub.

She would watch as these masses spun dizzyingly around giant clumps of gas, which in turn danced around great dark pockets. It was like watching an elemental ballet play out before her. Like it was being performed just for her.   She had created a million universes and each was as different to the last as a dream is to reality. She added the last drop of nitrogen. There was a tiny blast. The gasses began to unfurl, their wisp like arms reaching out in an exploratory gesture. She wondered what secrets this universe had to share with her.   -- -- -- --   This was unexpected. Life. She could not have predicted it.

Killed in her name. They learned to travel from rock to rock. They abandoned forever their own rock which had been pocketed by craters and polluted by toxins. They colonised other blue rocks but no rock ever lasted long. The creatures spread through the universe like a plague. They broke off into factions and fought and killed.

If it wasn't for all the news helicopters and SWAT units buzzing around him, he might've been amused by the sight of himself.   He had managed to kill three people and wound four in his animalistic rage, that nobody glued to the nearest screens could see the motivation behind.

He knew the procedure that the school would follow, the principal would bark \"LOCKDOWN\" into the PA system, and all the teachers would lock their doors, kill the lights, and do head counts. A recent graduate of Whelan High knew these procedures very well, and he abused them at the perfect times to raise the stakes for those watching at home.   Three more deaths later, and he got cocky.

Nothing so outlandish as the others, but it was good to just dream with her.   And now, she's right there.... Sipping tea. Just like the first dream started, I think. But in real life. Right in front of me. Just sitting there. She keeps the bag in the water, I remember that, too.   I sit near her, where she can see me, but I won't initiate a conversation, who knows, maybe I've just seen her around and made it all up. There's no way that she's g-   \"Evan?\" her voice is hopeful, but cracks like her throat is made of paper.   I just stare, I freak, what could I possibly say?   After a long moment, she freaks, too.\"I'm sorry, I thought you were someone else, I'm sorry, I've got t-\"   \"Evelynne,\" I reply. She laughs, smiles, we both do, and stare. My heart is hollow and racing and I weakly slip into the seat across from her.\"how is this even possible?\"   She just beams, her eyes dance and her smile radiates our emotion. I'm fidgetting in my jacket pockets, she idly dips the tea bag again and again.\"Evan, I... I don't know. What do you think is going on?\"   \"I don't know, but it's incredible.\" I just stare at her. At her smile, her arms, her wrist, the bag. The swinging teabag, just back and forth, carelessly, just, care free. Staring.   \"Evan, dear, are you okay?\"   I stare. I can only stare.   She whispers. It's new, and a rush, and it's beautiful.\"Evan, we're going to kill Doctor Edmund Alexander Hallstead.\"",

    "It is discovered that Possession works both ways and now we can have some payback. Demons of the underworld are now suffering under multiple cases of Humanic Possession. \"We haven't had a problem like this before, Gammorah\"   \"Explain to me what happened again\" he said, trying to feign concern, through his chuckling.   \"They were in mock torment class. Raem was put in the fake shackles when I was about to present the class with the flay method of torture. Before I can even begin, I hear Raem scream, \"Muh freedamns!\" while loosing himself from the mock bindings. He then proceeded to eat everything in sight, breathe heavily behind others walking, and only was he finally subdued after we caught him watching a clock asking, what bong it is. I'm not sure what we're going to have to do to get this problem to stop, but it's making a mockery of all we stand for.\"",

After the volcanic eruption send layers of layers of dark cloud that covered all parts of earth from the sun several years ago and now it snows even on the equator, that's our main source of energy, even more than before. This winter happening all over the world make it impossible to produce food if not for energy we gain from oil and technique to grow them within heated room. Still, most people died from hunger and cold, and now we are going to lose one thing that make survival possible for most people that still alive by now. Most hydro-power stopped because the water has turned into ice and no sunlight means no solar power, the cold broke wind turbines too. Only the geothermal and nuclear energy remained, and they are not enough.   This winter seemed to last forever. Only choice to survive is to take over the last working energy generator. But we might not going to survive this battle. In fact, I need to stop this battle, or there might none of us remained.",
    "Your amnesia is continuing to develop. Damn it why can't I remember anything? Where was I yesterday? Was there anything important that happened? Probably not? The days all blend together after a while anyway. Same stuff over and over again. But something's wrong today. I can't even recall if I did any writing. That's my favorite part of the day. I walk over to my journal. The last entry was four years ago. What? That's impossible. I wrote after making love to Sandy. I watched her breathing slowly. There's a poem in here. She'll know. Sandy always knows.   I step out of the room and call out for her.   \"Philip? I just went to check on something.\" A voice calls back. An older lady steps into the hallway. Scrubs? Why is a nurse in my house? I ask her where Sandy is.   \"Philip, I think it would be best if you went back to bed.\" She says. I run back into the room. No way. Where's Sandy? I hide in the closet and keep the door cracked open. The nurse walks in and looks around. She spots me.   I need to hide, but there's nowhere to go. I'm trapped.   \"Philip. Come on out. Let me read you the last entry of that journal you're holding.\" She says. I didn't even read it. Maybe it will tell me where Sandy is. I walk out and hand the journal to the nurse. She gestures to the bed and I sit down. She flips to a page effortlessly and begins:   \"Philip Terrance. You're losing your memory. You've already begun to forget what day it is. Soon you'll probably forget who people are, who you are. Who knows? Maybe you'll forget what language is. Revert back to a speechless child. Then you won't remember how to read this and someone will read it to you and maybe you won't know what they're saying. But I love you.\" The nurse closes the book. I don't understand. She smiles and puts her hand on mine.   \"I wrote that. Many years ago, when you started developing amnesia.\" She says. But that's my journal.   \"This isn't your journal. It's mine. You never wrote, but you admired me for keeping a journal.\" What? No. I remember writing. Don't I? She grasps my hand tighter.   \"You don't remember any specifics to writing do you? Just a general memory? That's because you're remembering a bit wrong. I'm your wife Sandy and you're Philip. We've been married for 30 years. And you have amnesia.\" It must be hard for her to say this to me.   Then, a stranger is holding my hand. She's holding a book and smiling at me. Where's Sandy?",
    "Exercising Your Subtext Skills The flash from the tech's camera lit up the droplets of condensation which were starting to pool around the base of the glass. One of the uniforms knocked against the table and the amber swayed like an abandoned see-saw. The tech waited for the liquid to settle and moved to the other side of the room and snapped again. He looked down at the LCD screen and hit delete. He snapped again. Still no good, too much lens flare off the glass, shining with moisture. He moved closer and say something on the glass he hadn't noticed before. There was a smudge of lipstick, a pristine finger print. He snapped once more, and moved on to the living room.",
    "The mega office buildings of the future have grown so huge that a nomadic people developed who travel from office wing to wing, subsisting on leftover doughnuts, birthday cakes, and pizza parties. \"Get to the Hard Drive Fields, and don't stop for nothin'. I'm much older and slower than you, so just get your ass there, and hide. I'll be there as soon as I can.\" Avi whispers to his grandson.   Six o'clock sends a rush of darkness and silence through the halls like a wave of death as the fluorescents kick off simultaneously. Avi's young grandson Karl hadn't been living here a full year. He had not yet witnessed the chaos of the post-Christmas party delirium. Young Karl was not aware that his grandfather stored food throughout the frozen cooling tanks in the underground fields, and Karl had not gone hungry, so he was not aware of the desperation that hunger brings.   The wave of darkness hits them, and Karl is sure he could feel it hit his skin. That feeling would dissipate as a much heavier rumbling bounces around in his chest. It is the pitter patter of feet weighed down by the fury of survival. Karl looks out of the Xerxes Toner Printer door he and his grandfather call home to witness a swarm of more hall dwellers stamping down their hall, B-Street.   \"Go Karl! Now! Run as fast as you can! Grab all you can! I will do my best to hold them off!\" Avi screams over the rumbling.   Karl takes off down the hall, his tote bags bouncing on all sides of him on their oversized leather straps, full of space reserved for party scraps. His thick rubber shoes squeak on the linoleum tiles, which reminds him of the year he spent at a real school, and he played kickball with other kids his age. He wouldn't realize how much he enjoyed that until it was gone. Now here he is, running up the corporate ladder hoping to catch a few crumbs.   Upon reaching the end of the hall, Karl takes a quick look back to see his grandfather standing in the middle of the hall with his arms spread wide. Someone clips his left shoulder at top speed, dislocating it immediately. Even over the yelling, Karl hears his grandfather's screams as he is battered like a rag-doll, slowing a humble fifteen maniacal nomads. Not enough to matter. Karl turns back and pushes the door opened. It is now that he realizes his journey from here on out may be full of trials and tribulation, but he also knows the importance of what it means to survive.   \"Here we go...\"",
    "the most detailed image yet comes back from Pluto, revealing the frozen remains of a civilisation. It transpires that the planet was thrown into its current orbit during a space war. Humanity scrambles to avoid the same fate for Earth. I never knew this is gon na happen. I was thinking hard trying to prepare a response. If being the president of this country was not difficult enough.   \"They have taken this too far now\" I thought shaking my head.   I called my secretary to arrange a meeting with the New horizons team.   \"Oh screw that! cancel their AMA and send them in my office as soon as possible. Its an order!\" I punched the words through the phone.   The New horizons team arrived in under one hour. Of course I arranged a private jet for them, though it may have created some skeptics and some conspiring media headlines but who cares I want this mess to be cleared up.   We sat in the meeting hall.   Silence.   \"What is this? Do you have any answer prepared for this ha!? You guys think that this government can cover up such things every single time?\" I break the ice.   \"Sir, I'm sorry this was just a hoax to gain more attention and funds. We are trying...\"   \"Hoax! for god sake have you seen what this has done. People are scared. They want answers from me. The whole world is waiting for my word.\"   \"But sir, If we can continue this for a little longer, we can become the central power of the world.

    "Use a Civ 5 (or any civ) game you've played to inspire a story. from one of my Civ 4 games (never played 5 on account of my shit pc)   \"Sire?\"  Emperor Wang Kon raised his head and focused his sight on the aged stocky adviser. Did he dose off again? Four hours of sleep doesn't appear to cut it anymore. Not good   \"We've just got word from Cuzco, the Incas, they...\"  \"They declared war.\" It was just a matter of time, he suspected the pompous boasts and threats from Huayna Capac to be more than hot air.  \"Ah, yes they are starting to mobilize their forces towards the northern provinces.\"  \"How many troops do we have stationed in Pyongyang and Wonsan?\"  \"Three battalions each, Your Grace.\"   They will hold for a while, the emperor imagined. The main Korean force, however, were still engaged in grueling skirmishes across the island nation of Mongolia. Kublai Khan's troops were under-equipped and used outdated weaponry, but the were numerous, and the Mongolian sovereign did not shy from throwing piles of them at Korean riflemen squads.   The emperor stood up. His joints cracked and creaked, God he felt old. \"The Mongolians resolved to a war of attrition it seems, send a letter to Kublai, he is cruel and shallow, but not foolish. We will offer peace and he will accept it.\" After he drains our treasuries for reparations, of course.   He started walking across the great imperial hall. The adviser joined his brisk pace, still holding notes, maps and letters in his small stubby hands. \"We have other news sire, the Indians, they have sworn fealty to the Inca empire.\"   \"Of course they have,\" Wan Kon murmured increasing his pace, \"what else would a lick-spittle like Gandhi do?\" The vile jealous Indians, always plotting and scheming. They have soldiers, however, and tanks and bombers and missiles, that would rain on Korean cities if Wang failed his duty.   \"See if you can get word from the Mayans and Greeks, they have no fondness for the Incas and I'll be damned if they are willing to forsake trade relations with us, no matter how intimidating Huayna's legions might seem.\"   \"Yes Your Grace.\" The adviser lowered his head and promptly removed his presence.  The emperor raised his head to the magnificent tapestries scattered across the great palace walls. They told stories of ancient glory and conquest. Of song and play. And, most importantly, the great victory in the war against the mighty Egyptian kings. He felt so small, so insignificant, so fearful.",
    "You have won a trip to visit the factory of [ any real life company ]. It is literally as magical as Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory. I've got some friends who work for Dupont, a plastics and chemicals manufacturing company. They rant about control systems and stress strain curves all day. So this will be fun.  -- -- --   I got off the bus with 5 other people more or less my age. they all have some kind of flexible and tough sheet in their hand similar to carbon fiber. They were all very friendly and eager, almost desperate to sieze up the competetion, ahem, I mean make connections. They were all talking about complicated subjects, non-newtonian behaviours, models, control systems, algorithms, and trying to one-up each other with things that I don't really understand. I'm just a paint technician who have been painting for years. I'm one of those people who like watching paint dry.   As soon as I stepped off the bus, the doors to the corporation opened, and out stepped a flamboyant man, dressed in a shimmering unearthly cloth. \"Greetings and salutations!\" He boomed, \"Welcome to Dupont's main manufacturing headquarters! I am Doug D.D. Dupont! We hope that you enjoy our little tour, and please, hold your questions until the end.\" Our small group looked like a pack of hungry wolves, eager to show their knowledge of the manufacturing process and impress their potential future employer. Nontheless, we obeyed and continued to follow him into the building.   The first room was a plain reception area. the receptionist stood up from her computer and gave us guest passes. They were made of an odd material. One or two others seemed to notice this but the rest just glossed over it.   We were led past the well lit areas containing the labs and offices to a dark corner that's very much been lacking upkeep. Tucked there was a service elevator. It was cramped, and I didn't particularly mind being pushed up against the women who were dolled up for this occasion. Our tour guide was giddy. As if he just can't wait to show us what's behing door number 1.   The elevator door opens and we pile out of the cramped space.   -- -- --   It's late. I'm going to sleep.",

But whilst I call myself a collector, these humans call me monster. They send their best to slay me, to claim my possession for their own. Hmph. Not even the greatest and brawniest of their warriors could kill me.   The dragon of promise is what I came to be known as. While my brothers and sisters were hunted to near extinction I live on. They can't harm me, and it's all thanks to you *предатель*. You didn't surprise me when you came to me. Many have before. Your confidence confused me to say the least. You. A creature of the light walking so pridefully into my lair, and using the old tithe to request audience with me angered me very much. But the dragon is patient, and thus I listened to your request. I recall the words perfectly.   \"We are born from the light, but bring nothing but darkness, death and destruction to this world. At our core, humans are sick beings. I know of your hate for us, so I ask this of you. Grant me power and I shall lay waste to those that murdered your siblings.\" The physical death meant nothing for me, for the spirit of the dragon is immortal.

    "Turns out it wasn't the Nazis hiding on the dark side of the moon. It was the Roman Empire. They've come back with a vengeance. \"Preparing to breach atmosphere, Legate!\"   \"Let it be done, captain.\"   Legate Caecilius Petrus Belisarius stood tall on the bridge of his titanic flagship *Cerberus*. His brilliant red cape fell almost to the floor behind him, secured by gold sunbursts on the front of his shoulders. His helmet was ridged with a large bristle of equally brilliant red horse hair. His breastplate, specially commissioned for the occasion, bore an elaborate engraving of a massive bull, horns lowered and charging. The bull's hooves pounded through stylized waves, whipping them up into a foam. The legate's boots and greaves were of burnished bronze, reflecting the blinking yellow and red lights of the console before him.   He stood on a high platform at the rear of the bridge. Below him, his men, dressed in more practical solid black, tight-fitting uniforms, worked efficiently at three banks of consoles. The bright blue earth filled the enormous window in front of them.   The engines came to life with a deep roar that filled the whole ship. Legate Belisarius felt just a small shudder before the inertial dampeners kicked in. The earth began to rotate downwards in the window as the captain oriented the ship for atmospheric entry. In a few moments, the window was filled with the blackness of space, which was quickly replaced with a red, fiery glow.   This was the critical moment. The *Cerberus* was an enormous vessel, eight stadia long -- over a kilometer, by the engineers' measure -- and two stadia across at its widest point. If they would fail, it would be here. Should the heat shields fail, or if the structure was not able to withstand the colossal stress, then they would break up in the atmosphere. Belisarius took solace in the fact that if either of those two things happened, they would likely not have more than a quarter second to realize what had happened before they were all burned to ash.   But the *Cerberus* held steady. This was solid Roman engineering -- designed by descendants of the ones who built the aqueducts and the Coliseum, built to last for three thousand years or more.   The ship glowed bright red, like a coal, as they burned through the sky. Seconds later, there were three more coals burning as more ships breached the atmosphere. Then a dozen. Then a hundred, as *Legio X Fretensis* began the invasion.   The die was cast.",
    "Hell has burnt out so they decided to create a New Hell and move everyone there. However, you overslept and missed the move. Now, you're sealed within the Old Hell as it gets colder and colder. Hell wasn't that bad, maybe I've got a good tolerance for pain but it never really bothered me to begin with. Demons weren't scary, punishments often came and went but we knew we deserved them. The best part about hell was at least we were surrounded by people, I had loneliness issues in life and it made me do my fair share of bad things. Being punished in hell has made sense of it to me. I was a hormonal teenager and a dick. Putting cyanide in the party mix just cause the host locked me in a cold, dark locker a few months back wasn't the best reaction, to be honest. I've always had trouble with small dark places too and that just did it for me. Plus when everyone took the hosts side and left me on my own I figured that if I had to be alone, so did everyone else. I drunk it myself to avoid getting in trouble and lo and behold, we all get sent to hell. Cindy and her twin sister Mindy (total bitches by the way) screamed and shouted at me, Derek (the crass ass who locked me in the locker) tried to throttle me before demons pulled him off me and Sarah (the girl I was crushing on who was dating Derek) just straight up cried when she realised they were all in hell because they were such good people apparantly. Well, after about 40 years we made peace with each other and we learned to just move past things. We became friends and actually had fun, regardless of all the torturing going around us. For the first time in my life and unlife, I was pretty happy, ironic considering the circumstances. Thats why when we were all rounded up for Newhell, we were excited to head over there, see exactly what all the curfuffle Satan made was about. We were last in line that felt like eternity but we made it through cracking jokes with each other and laughing a lot (honestly I think we bothered the other souls). It was finally our turn and we all went through, one by one. First Sarah (still as beautiful as ever), then Derek (my best friend), then Cindy and Mindy (lovably bitchy girls), then me. Before I was pulled back by the head demon. I was wondering what the problem was when he headed through the portal and it closed behind him.

But if anything too significant is changed, everyone influenced directly by the change turns into the mental equivalent of a vegetable. Survivor bias.   After the happening, there was much excitement and fear over mankind's new power. Pundits and preachers alike screamed the world was headed to hell within a week.   As it turned out, the very nature of changing the past made the activity quite self limiting. And Mankind caught on quick. Change too much and pay dearly. Change too little and no one noticed anyway.

Being cold always made her sore. She glanced over at the alarm clock. 1AM. The chairs in the senior center were too hard for her these days but her bed seemed a trip too far.

The garage door was opened directly on the sun. Paul was in the passenger seat, clutching his chest. He'd loose consciousness any minute now.   Samantha looked on her husband for the last time again. She chose to smile this go round.   She took Paul's hand from his chest and held it tight. Paul, too, managed a smile this time.

I swore to never destroy in a fit of wrathful vengeance their meager lives again. In this lie I became as human as any other. Souls lay in wait at my doorstep, judgement being passed proves difficult without myself.   They could never understand the weight on my shoulders, the overbearing guilt for every death, life, death.... I had eons before to plan this folly, countless follies to date, each ending the same.

They'll ask why, question the rationale, and wonder how they ended up in this predicament. Death, the unwelcome companion of life, always leaves behind a trail of questions.\n\nBut this time, the questions will be different. There will be no mistaking what happened before and what will happen next. It used to be that a city could vanish under a cloud of ash in an instant, but now, the great powers prefer to slowly grind their enemies into oblivion through relentless warfare. This method burrows into their psyche, becoming a part of their identity, until their old selves are left to wither in a world where such knowledge is useless. It is a new world, and it requires new people.\n\nSo, they, the passive ones, must be left to die, lonely sheep in a world now consumed with far more pressing matters. They won't understand why, those stuck in the past never do. Try to explain the demands of war, and all you get is denial and resistance.

    "Susan, come on! Time to go! Of course, she didn’t need to be reminded—this moment had been looming for what felt like ages. Perhaps it had taken too long. Children often perceive things that adults overlook, and Susan had sensed this coming for months, maybe even years. Late night arguments, when they assumed she was fast asleep. Voices raised loudly enough to shake the fixtures and rattle the walls. It was inevitable that this day would come, the day when her life would be uprooted and she’d be whisked away to a far-off place—it was astonishing it had taken this long.\n\nOn this fateful day, she found herself sitting on her bed, staring at the now barren walls. Posters and pictures that made the room hers had disappeared. Yesterday, they had stripped the entire room—her toys, clothes, games; her whole world packed into a van because her parents could no longer tolerate being near each other, nor even within the same city. Oxford would never feel like home, not like Maidstone did. Forced to leave her school, uprooted from her friends, severed from the life she knew and the people she trusted—gone, just like that. Replaced with an ocean of uncertainty—unfamiliar faces and foreign streets.\n\n\"Hey, hey, what's all this?\" Clearly, she had lingered too long on her bed, tears streaming down her face. Throughout the whole process of their separation, she had stayed detached and withdrawn, trying not to let it touch her, but now that the final moment had arrived, it was all too overwhelming. \"Little one, come here… it'll be alright.\" The special nickname her dad had given her lifted her spirits slightly, even through her tears, as he pulled her into a warm hug. \n\n“One day, you'll understand—you’ll see this was for the best for everyone—your mother, you, and me. Understand that we love you, and that will remain unchanged, no matter if you’re in Oxford, Maidstone, or anywhere else in the world. There's a vast world of opportunities ahead, Susan, and no matter where you go or what you choose to do, we’ll always be with you.”",
    "You live in Skyrim, tasked with keeping candles lit in abandoned caves, dungeons, and castles. Light transforms these dark places into welcoming spaces; without it, even palaces feel cold and depressing. Baldin understood this well. The Old Kingdom is filled with forgotten knowledge and artifacts hidden in ruins and abandoned temples. No one would dare explore these dark places without a guiding light.\n\nBaldin preferred solitude, observing people from a distance. At night, a single candle acts like a beacon, attracting adventurers from all over, like moths to a flame. Baldin made sure a lack of light wouldn't stop them. Adventurers love to explore and discover new things but remain unaware of the invisible hand guiding them. They go where Baldin wants them to go.\n\nThough old and forgotten, the caves and ruins are not empty. Traps await the unwary, and the creatures inside can be dangerous. However, great rewards await the brave: Dwarven metals, Dremoran trinkets, Daedric armors, and more. Skyrim boasts some impressive adventurers.\n\nAll thanks to light. Once an adventurer conquers a dungeon and heads home, they follow the lights blindly, even if they've moved. Sometimes they return to find the candles gone. Baldin enjoys playing tricks on his guests. He knows most cannot go days without light. If they can't find their way out, they often go mad, injuring themselves or worse. Or they might try to sleep, leaving all the loot for Baldin.\n\nLight is a marvelous thing.",

Beauty feels absent in this world, replaced by a gut-wrenching emptiness and the sharp teeth of loneliness gnawing away.\n\nTorment: noun.\n1.

    "“On your right, you’ll see the natives living along the beach, and they are NOT happy with us being in their sacred waters,” Marcus muttered into an imaginary microphone as we floated on our barely-holding-together rubber raft, now riddled with darts and primitive arrows. Our emergency escape pod had suffered severe damage on the descent to the planet’s surface. The lightweight, heat-resistant alloys served as makeshift armor for us and our rubber survival raft.\n\nOur only hope was to get out of the natives' territory and reach the Federation outpost downriver. These ape-like creatures, reminiscent of Earth’s gorillas in their survival habits, built “nests” in trees that looked like the treehouses any kid would want. They avoided swimming, preferring to get their hydration from native plants and fruits.\n\nI was supposed to study these primitives to see if they could be educated and integrated into the galactic community. But after two years of observing them from the Federation Cruiser, the *Iaculum*, I doubted they had much potential for advancement. My colleague, meanwhile, had less respect for them, frequently joking about giving peace offerings of bananas.\n\nAs we floated downstream, the natives followed us along the shore, matching our pace. Some carried spiked clubs made from local fauna tails, others had blowguns and crude bows. We only had a small rifle to defend ourselves if the currents ran us aground. The natives believed that water was a portal between the land of the dead and the living, and anything from the water was seen as an undead demon.\n\nMarcus ducked, but thankfully no arrows or darts hit us. For the first time since I met him, fear crossed his face.\n\n“What’s wrong?” I dared to ask.\n\nHe quickly raised his hands, signaling for silence, and listened intently. Peeking over the plating, he said, “Ooh, that’s not good. Isaac, do you hear rushing water?”\n\n“We’re in a boat. I’d be more concerned if there wasn’t,” I quipped.\n\n“The natives have stopped following us, and it’s getting louder. Oh shitsnaps.”\n\nSudden terror filled me as I realized what he meant. The noise grew louder. \n\nA waterfall.",
    "In a post-apocalyptic world, we hung on every word of The Mighty Magic Eight Ball, or \"MMate\" as we called it. Mervyn, our red-soul-patched leader, carefully slipped the scuffed black orb into its handcrafted leather pouch. He looked at the seven of us with a mix of hope and determination. \"Guys,\" he shouted over the harsh winds of what used to be the frozen Jersey Highlands, \"we've wandered far, guided by MMate. Today, it has led us to our new home!\" \n\n\"Hey Merv,\" called Quinten, our cartographer, from the back, \"according to my maps, we're in what's left of Newark.\" Nervous murmurs rippled through our small group. \n\n\"Don't worry, friends!\" Mervyn reassured, \"MMate wouldn't lead us wrong. This is our destined place.\"\n\n\"But isn't this where the old wars started?\" Blandie, our chef, questioned.\n\n\"Yeah,\" Quinten replied, glaring at Mervyn. \"This is ground zero for the first atomic blasts. They said the land here spits fire at anything that touches it.\"\n\nThe wind was the only sound that followed. \n\nQuinten stepped forward, arms outstretched. \"Let me see MMate, Mervyn.\"\n\nMervyn clutched the leather pouch tightly to his chest. \"No!\" he yelled before bolting down the hill. We stood there, watching in shock as he hopped over a glowing brook and held MMate high, shaking it for guidance. Again and again, he shook it, until finally, a scream of rage echoed through the air. It sounded like a beast waking up to find its den filled with useless twigs and old newspapers instead of food for the winter.\n\nMervyn ran off, MMate still held above his head. BOOM. A huge pillar of purple flame shot up, swallowing our leader and our guide in an instant. Mervyn’s charred body hit the ground with a soft thud and a cloud of dust. MMate was flung back toward us from the force of the explosion. Quinten caught it, peering into its melted, charred plastic. The last message it gave us, in eerie clarity, was: \"Outlook not so good.\"",
    "Most of the Milky Way galaxy is governed by a vast interstellar empire, comprising hundreds of alien races. The ruling species of the monarch constantly changes; upon death, the emperor is reincarnated as a member of a different race. You are the first human reincarnation of this ruler. \n\nThe years before ascension have always been my favorite. Born with all the knowledge of my past incarnations, there is little need for me to \"grow up\" or be educated in the nuances of galactic rule. However, long ago, I decreed that each of my reincarnations must reach the age of majority before assuming the throne. Death has not frightened me for millennia; each passing brings new possibilities and a welcome respite from my galactic responsibilities for a few years.\n\nI do not understand the mechanism by which my reincarnation is chosen. Many theories abound. Some species have been blessed half a dozen times, while others never, and on rare occasions, I am reborn into a race yet to join my Empire. These instances I relish with great enthusiasm, as they signify that these races will play a pivotal role in the future of my Empire. Most of them are gifted with advanced technologies or cultures rich in profound philosophies and art.\n\nMy first day on Earth, January 1, 2016, was bewildering. Born into this primitive backwater, the people were vastly different from what I had come to expect from new entrants to my Empire. They had barely ventured into space, their planet was divided into hundreds of squabbling factions, and their culture needed much development. In time, I discovered why: while primitive and weak, these humans possessed a thirst for knowledge, a passion for exploration, and an incredible speed in developing their technological prowess. They were fighters who achieved victory against overwhelming odds repeatedly, and created inspiring art, music, and stories.\n\nI grew up in a place called Florida and learned to enjoy the long, hot summers, mild winters, and the diverse array of scantily clad women the white sand beaches attracted year-round. Eighteen years in this primitive paradise made me melancholy when the Imperial Dreadnought appeared in orbit, eclipsing the moon to announce to my newest subjects their ascension into the Galactic Empire. I will miss this pale blue dot, but the Empire can wait no longer.",
    "A programmer at Facebook accidentally releases an update that posts every photo from a cell phone’s camera roll. Every single picture. The news splashed it across their cover pages with headlines like, \"Watch out! All pictures from phone are posted on Facebook.\" Luckily for me, I had no pictures on my phone anyway.\n\nI live in an apartment with my wife, Connie. We've been married for five years, have no children, and keep mostly to ourselves. Lately, Connie and I have been drifting farther apart. She complains that I prefer playing with technology over spending time with her. Just excuses, in my opinion. I knew our relationship was dying and had frankly had enough of it.\n\nCurious about the buzz, I checked Facebook. As I scrolled through various photos—some of them quite graphic—one image made my heart stop. There was my wife with other men. Disgusting, but not entirely surprising.

    "---\nThe world's deadliest hitman is hunting the world's luckiest man.\n\nI may be late to the party, and I’m definitely not a writer, but here’s a story I just had to share. I hope you find it as thrilling as I did.\n\nAfter the Prime Minister's assassination, my career skyrocketed. The CIA had me on speed dial for every high-profile target—drug smugglers, politicians, corporate executives. No one was beyond my reach. No agency, big or small, could protect them. I was certain of that.\n\nWhen the lone survivor of United 215 finally spoke, the world was desperate for answers. How did he survive? What really happened? Eight hundred fifty-three passengers were on that Airbus A380 when it burst into flames mid-air, crashing down like a fallen phoenix.\n\nThe crash's timing was uncanny, coinciding with the FAA's annual commercial airline safety summit just weeks later. The survivor was invited to testify before Congress about his harrowing experience. That’s when I got the call from Langley.\n\nI trailed my target for days, realizing this would be my most challenging mission yet. Pulling off a hit in New York City is no small feat—it had to be swift. As he stepped out of his Gramercy apartment, coffee steaming in his \"My other computer is a data center\" mug, I knew my moment had come.\n\nOur eyes met for a fleeting second. He smiled, greeted me, and then crumpled to the ground. No one saw the Hydra-Shok round pierce his heart. Chaos ensued as bystanders rushed to his aid. I slipped away, draped my trench coat over a homeless man. \"Thank you, miss! God bless!\" he said. Everyone deserves a bit of kindness. Life in America is hard.\n\n---\n\n\"You won't believe what I heard yesterday—it's insane!\"\n\n\"So, I'm standing on the corner, heading to work, minding my own business. Suddenly, the guy next to me just collapses. I rush to help, only to see blood pouring from his chest. The guy had been shot, right there.\"\n\n\"That's nuts!\"\n\n\"Wait until you hear the craziest part.\"\n\n\"I was so distracted by the blood I didn't really look at his face... until I did.

    "Raindrops mingled with the solitary tear on my cheek as I whispered the words I hoped would change everything: \"For what it's worth, I've always loved you.\" \n\nMy mind raced through the tapestry of our years together, a bond forged beyond logic or chance. We had created something powerful, something most people only dream of. For years, we were inseparable friends, keeping our deeper feelings at bay. She was my angel, and I was her rock. Yet, the halcyon days of that sweet summer when we finally took the leap of faith and embraced our love now felt so distant.\n\nGazing into her once-hopeful eyes, now clouded with sadness, I couldn't help but question, \"Why? Why like this? Why couldn't we make it work?\" My head shook, struggling to find words to bridge the chasm that had formed between us. \"Life is cruel. It's hurled us onto different paths. It's agonizing to say this, but I wish this wasn't goodbye.\"\n\nHer hand found mine, squeezing tightly, a fleeting connection amidst the torrent of emotions. \"I'm a better person because of you.

And then, I made a wish I'd come to regret: \"God, before I die, can I just have one girlfriend? Just one?\"\n\n\"That's when you became immortal?\" Dr. Martinez asked flatly, giving me a skeptical look.\n\nI glanced up at her from my hospital bed. \"Well, I've shot myself, electrocuted myself, hanged myself, poisoned myself with carbon monoxide, and overdosed.\"\n\n\"I see, so you've been attempting this for a while.\"\n\n\"Actually, all that happened just last Tuesday night.\"\n\n\"Ah.\"\n\nShe's quite attractive—long blonde hair and grey eyes that caught the light.

The pass in front of them was the only link to the outside world, the only way for food to enter the valley. That was until the beast appeared.

He sat in his office chair, comfortably typing random words on a disconnected keyboard and staring at a blank monitor. It was a warm day, as all days had become.\n\nIt's unclear when things shifted, but as more jobs became obsolete, basic income was introduced. The era of creativity and learning was short-lived.

Bruce brushed past him, not even bothering to engage.\n\n“You won’t go through with it, Batboy!” Joker’s taunts echoed as Bruce slipped through a creaky door.\n\nJoker knew exactly how far he could push Batman – but this time, he might have overstepped. If Batman snapped, Joker would be the one who drove him there, practically his partner in crime. As an explosion rocked the area, Joker realized – Batman had crossed the line. He killed, and for the thrill of it.\n\n“This is just too insane, even for me,” Joker mused. He knew he had to stop Batman. Chaos was his domain, not Bruce’s. A decision formed – he’d defeat Batman, not with evil, but by being the hero Gotham needed, not necessarily the one it wanted.",
    "Imagine striking a deal with a higher power that grants you eternal life. The catch? You must kill one person every year. Miss this grim task by even a minute, and you perish. \n\nKilling has always come naturally to me. Crossing the Atlantic with my newfound immortality, I had no trouble meeting my quota. In fact, I often exceeded it on my journey to Western America. Over the years, I amassed various fortunes and adopted countless identities. \n\nDuring my time traversing the plains, months would pass without encountering another soul. Yet, when I did, it was a simple matter of pulling the trigger from afar or inviting them to camp for a midnight slaying. They say times were tougher then, and perhaps they were. But they were also lawless, especially in California.\n\nFar from their homelands and gods, people seemed unmoored. Early on, reactions to my handiwork in towns were steeped in piety. They attributed the deaths to demons or other supernatural forces. My killing spree in Pennsylvania, lasting fifteen years, was even credited to a so-called \"vampire.\"\n\nBut with the dawn of the industrial age, the divine faded into the background. Machines and progress killed God, or so it seemed. As the 20th century approached, newfound opportunities rendered faith obsolete. People grew cynical and wary, leaving no room for the supernatural in their explanations of my deeds.\n\nCaution became paramount, yet the act was still child's play. Killing has always been easy. It always will be.",

    "You’re perpetually late, always missing the last bus, the green light, even the chance to ask someone out. It’s been that way all my life. My mother used to joke that I was born a week late, setting the tone for a lifetime of tardiness. School, bed, work—never on time. I tried; I really did. But traffic, flat tires, and the occasional accident always stood in my way.\n\nDespite all this, I managed a decent life—an understanding boss, a loving family, a home (though the car often didn’t survive my luck). By 70, I retired, still a bit late, but finally free to enjoy my golden years. My children, punctual as ever, likely learned from my chronic lateness.\n\nAs I lay surrounded by family, ready to depart this world, I couldn’t help but reflect on a life well-lived, despite its delays. Closing my eyes, I took my final breath, probably late even to death. Yet, my soul lingered. I watched over my mourning family and waited. Hours turned into days.\n\nThen, on the third day, a man appeared. Impeccably dressed in a suit, his face forgettable but his timing impeccable. \"I’m sorry I’m late,\" he said, glancing at a pocket watch marked with a Scythe. \"We didn't think you’d be on time. Come with me; I’ll take you home.\"",
    "Susan Quin Tailor had always cherished rabbits. Her mother, who endearingly called her Susie Cutie, frequently recounted stories of young Susan, scarcely able to crawl, darting after wild rabbits on their family farm. Her first full sentence, adorably, had been, \"Bunny tails are cute, cute, cute!\" In those early days, she could never catch her elusive quarry, finding solace instead in stuffed rabbits her parents gifted her and a lucky rabbit's foot her uncle clandestinely placed under her pillow. Those were truly joyful moments.\n\nAt the age of 7, fate seemed unkind as the family farm hit dire straits, forcing them to relocate to the city. They squeezed into a modest two-bedroom apartment with views limited to city pigeons and squirrels—rabbits were nowhere to be seen. Initially, Susan struggled to adapt to urban life, soon earning the nickname \"Susie Tailor the Bathroom Wailer\" after a tearful episode in the school restroom upon learning rabbits were not part of the curriculum. Concerned for their daughter's well-being, her parents scraped together money for a counselor to address what they dubbed the \"bunny obsession.\"\n\nMiraculously, therapy had a transformative effect. Susie Cutie rebounded in remarkable fashion, so much so that by junior high, she nearly topped the popularity charts at school. Rabbits became a mere footnote in her conversations. In high school, Susan's passion for biology blossomed, fueling her aspiration to become a biologist or perhaps a zookeeper. She doggedly pursued academic excellence, setting her sights on a distinguished college program in animal sciences.\n\nCollege life was splendid for Susan. She excelled in her studies, reveling in campus life, and graduated early, near the pinnacle of her class. Post-graduation, she ventured from the urban environments she’d known for most of her life, embarking on an internship at a farm.\n\nOn that farm, Susan's rabbit fascination reignited when she glimpsed a rabbit's cute tail disappear into the horse stables. With mounting excitement, she cornered the rabbit in a stall, lifting it up and cradling it affectionately. Despite the rabbit's kicking and scratching, Susan's thick shirt and gloves protected her. When the rabbit, exhausted, ceased its struggle, Susie Cutie, heart brimming with a lifetime of anticipation, gently stroked between its ears. Smiling, Susan then twisted the rabbit's head sharply, ending its life, before flipping it over to admire that cute, cute bunny tail closely.",

    "Dear Kyle,\n\nIt's hard to believe it's been almost seven years since we last saw each other. Seven years since I returned the white dress and canceled the venue down payment. Seven years since I scrambled to find an apartment in a college town, trying to piece my life back together after we split up. Seven years since you crushed my heart and made me question my self-worth, my life, and everything I had believed about myself and my future.\n\nBut I'm not writing to dredge up the past—you remember it as well as I do. I'm writing to thank you. Your departure was the catalyst that showed me just how strong I am and what I’m capable of achieving. Since then, I’ve completed not one but two master’s degrees (with a few minors and an early education degree thrown in for good measure) and am currently working on a third. I've learned how to fix my car and how to live independently. But that’s not why I’m reaching out.\n\nI’m writing to thank you because, by leaving, you made room for something incredible. I've found a supportive partner who travels the world with me and loves me for who I am. Together, we've shared experiences and adventures I never could have imagined. If you hadn't walked out that door, I wouldn't have become a teacher in a warm, snow-free place, discovered my favorite wine is Riesling, learned to love Thai food (although chicken mac still holds a special place in my heart), or found out that Wasabi is amazing and the Baltimore Ravens are my favorite team.\n\nYour absence taught me resilience, revealed hidden talents (hello, crafting, teaching, and cooking), and showed me just how awesome I can be and what a great wife I am capable of becoming. So truly, thank you for leaving.\n\nI wish you the best in all your endeavors and hope you live a long, happy life. I know I will.\n\nWarm regards,\n[Your Name]",

    "\"Will I be safe?\" Christopher's voice wavered slightly. Silence stretched before a low and seemingly soothing voice emerged from the shadows. \"Of course...\"\n\nHe took a step forward, curious yet cautious. \"Can we play games?\" he asked, his innocence palpable. The floor groaned under the shifting weight of the unseen presence. Lips wetly smacked together, the air hissing out in a sentence. \"As many as you'd like...\"\n\nAnother step closer. \"And you're here for me?

The eerie noise of teeth chattering and a clicking jaw filled the space. \"My boy... you are what I came for...\"\n\nBut then, something shifted. A sense of control passed to Christopher. \"Why don't you have a seat?\" he asked, his tone curiously composed.\n\nThe presence hesitated, realizing too late that it wasn't guiding the situation anymore.

    "Half a year ago, an announcement shook the globe: a meteor was on a collision course with Earth, threatening to wipe out all life. But as fate would have it, the meteor narrowly missed our planet, after humanity had braced itself for the end. Six months—just that short span of time—was all it took for humanity to come together with a common purpose in the face of annihilation. It's almost poetic, isn't it? After countless centuries marred by conflict, with nations clashing and beliefs in opposition, humanity united in a final, desperate bid to survive. We exhausted every option, explored every possibility, and tore down every barrier during those months of frantic searching for a solution. \n\nAnd then, the dreaded event didn't happen. United, we watched the sky with bated breath... and nothing came. When television networks around the world delivered the news that we were safe, that the threat had passed us by the narrowest of margins, reactions were mixed. Some of us stood in shock, others wept tears of relief, and many shouted out in sheer joy.\n\nBut oh, the things we unearthed in those six months! The knowledge we amassed, the discoveries we made—born from shared efforts and rapid exchanges of ideas—each discarded concept adding layers of potential new avenues to explore. In the wake of this newfound unity, no one wished to sever the bond or abandon the technological wonders we had crafted together, so no one did. The desire to stay connected and not be left behind prevailed.\n\nThe catastrophic event that wasn't marked the dawn of a new technological era and heralded an unprecedented period of peace. Now, united as one, we set our sights on the cosmos.",
    "Upon arriving home from work, you discover a stranger in your house. Initially panicked, you soon realize that the stranger is actually your beloved pet who has somehow transformed into a human. \n\nOne evening while working at the hotel, where I manage and have developed a rapport with the local police due to frequent incidents with disruptive guests, I received a voicemail. It was Kerry from the police station. “Mr. Smith? This is Kerry. We found a distressed man outside your home, wearing a dog collar with your name and number. He keeps repeating your name. Could you come to the station to help identify him?”\n\nLiving alone in a rural area, I couldn't imagine anyone visiting, much less someone wearing a dog collar. Other than my Black Lab, King Louie, of course. I informed the front desk that I was leaving early at 6 p.m. and headed to the police station.\n\nThere, I was led to a holding room with a fit Black man in sweatpants on the other side of the glass. Kerry explained, “We barely got him into those pants; he was howling and saying 'Luther.' If you’d like, you can see him.”\n\nI responded, \"I don't recognize this man.\"\n\nKerry continued, \"We tried to remove his collar but he bit Walter. We assumed he was troubled.\" Just then, the man started sniffing the air and moved towards the glass.\n\n\"Luther?!\" he shouted, \"LUTHER!\"\n\nDespite being scared and curious, I gathered my courage, entered the room, and the man knocked me down, his long tongue licking my face. With his knees digging into my stomach and his fists on my shoulders, I instinctively reacted, \"Oh Cripes. Up, boy!\"\n\n\"Do you know him? Is he your partner? We're not judging, but we couldn't find any prints on him...\"\n\n\"No, I do not know this man,\" I insisted, although the man clung to my leg. Kathy noted, \"He seems quite attached to you.\"\n\nLooking into his eyes, I saw the familiar gaze of my pet of three years. He was a tall, strong man with curly black hair. Feeling a sudden urge to take him home, I exclaimed, \"Cousin Louie?!\"\n\nThe man responded, \"Home?!\" tugging at my heartstrings.\n\nAfter completing some paperwork and a court hearing due to an incident with a female officer, we headed home. In the car, I hesitantly asked, \"King Louie?!\"\n\n\"YES!\" he barked.\n\nHoly crap, I thought. If this happened to him, what might my calico cat look like now? She always loved sleeping on my pillows…",

    "At the age of 18, everyone selects an unexpected life event. They will be reborn at 18 each time they die until that event occurs. Following that, death becomes final. It's a concept we call \"death by fulfillment.\" Our society believes that everyone deserves the opportunity to chase their aspirations to the very end. Some individuals craft masterpieces by amassing lifetimes of knowledge. Others simply wish to find joy by experiencing true love, as perfect matches are rare yet achievable given an eternity.\n\nBut I am terrified of death.\n\nMany of my peers still reside with their parents, as it’s likely that both parent and child will not achieve their goals within a single lifetime. However, by an astronomical chance, both my parents have passed away.\n\nMy father, in a moment of brilliance, painted the artwork now displayed in the National Gallery in the capital. I have not seen it. My mother, being the reserved person she was, simply wished to have a child with a man she loved. She lived fewer lifetimes than my father. Nonetheless, she had me and passed away when I was 8. Simply put, my very existence had ended her life.\n\nI am deeply afraid of death.\n\nI still remember that night my mother came home in tears. She was drunk, cursing the fate she had chosen. She had no one to blame but herself. And perhaps me. She might not have meant it—she was drunk.

Perhaps it is finally time to learn from someone who faced death willingly. Perhaps it is finally time to visit the museum.",
    "God presents you with three doors—each with a unique destiny. Door One promises eternal happiness, insight into a world where sorrow and despair no longer exist. Door Two offers infinite knowledge, the profound wisdom that could unravel the mysteries of life and beyond. Then, there’s Door Three, an enigmatic choice, shrouded in mystery, as God has never opened it.\n\nI stand before these doors, reflecting on their promises. Eternal happiness—what does that even mean? Can such a state truly exist where no depression or setbacks ever touch you? I recall sitting anxiously on the examination table, the harsh, unwavering clock stuck at noon, as I waited for the doctor to deliver my fate. The news was devastating: cancer. The memory of my beautiful wife supporting me until my last bedridden days haunts me. Would eternal happiness mean I could be with her again? But could ignorant bliss truly fulfill me, or would the pursuit of knowledge and understanding bring deeper contentment?\n\nThe third door, though, intrigues me the most. Is it merely an illusion of hope, a temptation of something far greater than happiness or knowledge? Why has no one opened this door before? What secrets does it hold that even God hasn’t revealed? It feels like he's nudging me toward it, but this decision is mine alone.\n\nAs I step closer, the door seems to grow, overwhelming in its presence. God's expression shifts from a knowing smile to a neutral watchfulness. And then, as I grasp the handle, I’m pulled into an abyss of darkness. The door shuts slowly behind me, with God’s eyes fading into the blackness.\n\nIn this void, I hear the distant cries of a woman, an urgent, heavy breathing that guides me towards a faint glimmer of light. Struggling forward, I finally escape the darkness, emerging into a soothing, warm light. My past identity fades, my body submitting to a newfound sense of peace and security.\n\nWrapped in gentle, loving arms, I realize that this journey, the leap of faith into the unknown, has led me to a profound new beginning.",

    "In a rather peculiar twist of the law, citizens are granted the legal right to commit a single act of murder, provided that all the requisite documentation is completed, and the intended victim is duly informed of the impending threat. Despite this bizarre legality, my living situation was almost enviable. My housemates, though not matching my intellectual prowess, were agreeable companions. Our spacious abode allowed us to coexist without encroaching on each other's lives; we attended our classes, returned home, dined, and paid our bills in harmony. My aspirations to become a doctor were met with respect by my friends, and I felt a deep sense of gratitude for this supportive environment, which was a vast improvement compared to the dormitories. Surprisingly, our house was more tranquil than the rowdy dorms, even if it was somewhat messier. I was content to endure the untidiness for a few more years.\n\nOne evening, an unexpected knock interrupted our routine. Tommy, who was nearest to the door, answered.\n\n\"Jack, it's for you, bro,\" he called out.\n\nFeigning nonchalance, I responded, \"So, let her in.\"\n\nBut Tommy's voice held a note of urgency. \"No, Jack, he says he needs to see you right now in person.\"\n\nA sense of dread washed over me as I glanced at my watch. Had I missed an appointment? If so, I had completely forgotten about it. Standing in the doorway was a man clad in regulation khakis and a standard-issue blue button-down shirt—an official of some sort. He held a small electronic device, which he extended toward me while requesting my signature.\n\nBewildered, I asked, \"What is this?\"\n\n\"Notification.

I'm drowning in debt and completely alone. So alone...\" I cried out.\n\nI felt a hand on my shoulder—not holding me back but pushing me forward. The Guru then spoke, \"Do not worry, sir. You appear to have endured much suffering. Let that pain drive you towards feeling better. Everyone experiences loneliness; it will pass with time. As for the debt, it can only be resolved with patience. So be patient, and you will eventually be well. Let my hand be the first to push you towards your future. It may not be a significant push, but it will help guide you in the right direction.\"\n\nMy throat tightened, and I barely managed to whisper, \"I've given my problems nothing but time! It's been 20 years, and nothing has changed! I'm still in debt and all alone. How can you say that a push will set me on the right path when I've been going the wrong way my whole life?\"\n\nThe Guru sighed and said, \"Do you truly believe there's no hope? Do you really think it will never get better?\"\n\n\"Yes...\" I whispered.\n\n\"There is nothing more I can do, my friend. I have tried to help you, but you refuse to accept it. So go, release your earthly ties, step into the void, empty yourself, and become the wind.\"",
    "“All 9 crew members secure on board,” the intercom announced. But weren't there supposed to be just 8 crew members? \n\n“Nine? Did she just say nine?” Duncan questioned.\n\n“Yeah, nine. Just like when we left Earth. You, me, Travis, Jill, Cyborg FDR, Amish Caligula, Rainbow Brite, Teddy Fish, and Mr. Poopybutthole,” Mary responded from the acceleration couch beside Duncan.\n\n“Oh yeah, I guess that is nine. It's just - I thought it was supposed to be eight?” Duncan scratched his chin thoughtfully.\n\n“Oh Duncan,” Amish Caligula chimed in, “you always had trouble with numbers. Remember third grade?”\n\nDuncan recalled Mrs. Martin’s classroom in Topeka, struggling with multiplication tables until Calamari Jenkins, CJ, began tutoring him every night until he could pass his math tests. \n\n“That’s right, Duncan,” CJ said, emerging from the cargo hold. “And I've been helping you ever since. Remember when we fought The Mathemagician in Laos?”\n\n“Boy, you sure gave me a good shellacking!” The Mathemagician added.\n\n“Yeah, I guess I did.” Duncan replied, unsure.\n\n“What about the time your stuffed rabbit butler, Mr. Velvet Ears, tried to have you arrested on customs fees fraud because you didn't declare that candy you brought back from Europe?” Cyborg FDR questioned. “Roy the customs agent was furious that day.”\n\n“I sure was, Cyborg FDR,” said Roy the customs agent. “But we worked through it, Duncan. We're family. Just like Dirt Reynolds, Lard Lad, Green Winter, and all the rest. We joined this mission because we care.”\n\n“Did all of you go down to that last planet with us?” Duncan asked.\n\n“Of course they did,” Mary replied before anyone else could.\n\nSuddenly, a tiny alert flashed on the console: BIOLOGICAL CONTAMINATION. Mr. Velvet Ears quietly turned it off.",
    "A person has passed away and all I can think about is where I misplaced my yo-yo. *Goodness, look at her make-up. She looks like a clown. I wonder about the mortician’s experience.*  \n\"Yes, she was a wonderful person. Thank you.\"  \n*How long do I have to stay here? I'm extremely hungry. Who is that woman? Wow, look at her. Oh no, she's coming over.*  \n\"Yes, she was a wonderful person. Thank you.\"  \n*She’s so attractive. Maybe I should talk to her. No, that's not appropriate. But it feels like that movie with Vince Vaughan and Owen Wilson—where Will Ferrell picks up women at funerals.*  \n\"Yes, she was a wonderful person. Thank you.\"  \n*Maybe I should approach her.

Thank you.\"  \n*Was it in that shoebox in my room? One of my jackets? Oh, I loved that yo-yo. I used to play with it every day. Okay, gotta find a seat. Why is it so crowded here? How did she know this many people? There’s a seat... right next to that woman.*  \n\"Hi. Thanks for coming.\"  \n*Amazing Grace is such a sad song. Everyone's crying. I wish I could lift the mood a bit. I'd do some yo-yo tricks. This woman would definitely be impressed. Oh no, it’s my turn to speak.*  \n\"Uh... hi, everyone. It means a lot to us that you came.\"  \n*I should have written a speech. What do I say? I wish I were a kid right now, just sitting in the back playing with my yo-yo.*  \n\"Uh...\"  \n*I'd do cradles, scorpions, and walk the dog. I have to find that yo-yo.*  \n\"Uh...\"  \n*Dude, your mom’s passed away and all you can think about is where you left your yo-yo.*",
    "A young girl steals from a bank. How does she do it? Tiny treads create swirls and patterns at the base of Sara's sneakers, these intricate designs becoming visible as she stretches and strains to reach the high ledge. She starts to wobble as her feet barely touch the ground, relying only on her toes. Her parents continue chatting with the banker about topics she finds uninteresting as she eyes an object just out of reach, a spark of determination in her gaze. \n\nSara stabilizes herself, using her small, chubby fingers to climb upward toward the treasure on the table when her father finally notices. \"Sara, please sit down!\" he whispers urgently. Misinterpreting her outstretched arms, he lifts her onto his lap and resumes his conversation.\n\nThe coveted item gleams under the fluorescent lights, its smooth metal surface taunting her just inches away. As Sara leans and twists toward it, her father's arm blocks her path. He constantly adjusts his grip and the knee she sits on, pulling her further from the object she wants. Restless and squirming, Sara quickly exhausts her father's patience, prompting him to put her back on the floor. His reprimands go unheard as she fixates on the now visible pen at the edge of the table.\n\nLowering herself to the carpet, Sara swipes at the glistening cylinder, pushing it closer to the ledge—a window of opportunity she intends to exploit. With her parents distracted again, she stretches upward and climbs the vertical surface with her fingertips for balance. Like a skilled thief, she moves slowly and quietly to avoid attracting attention, dragging the pen closer with her small fingers. Her mouth forms an \"O\" of surprise as the cool metal meets her skin. Focused on her task, she unconsciously licks her cheek.\n\nFinally, she grasps the pen, drawing it to her chest with a quiet gasp of triumph. She quickly hides the prized possession in her pocket as the meeting above concludes. A hand firmly grips her arm, leading her out of the bank as she silently celebrates her success. In the backseat of the car, she retrieves the fountain pen she had stolen and examines it. Though she can't explain why the pen feels so satisfying to have, it does. It’s her little secret.",
    "You are a time traveler sent to prevent Kennedy's death, but you find yourself amidst the chaos of the Normandy invasion. \"30 Seconds!\" Lee's heart pounded in his chest. \"Holy hell, where am I?\" he thought. He was sent to 1963 to stop the assassination of JFK, but clearly, something had gone terribly wrong. \n\nHis Time-Watch buzzed, the screen glowing with a message only he could see: \"Lee, we screwed up. We can't get you out until '64. P.S. If you're not dead before you read this, you're about to invade Normandy with the US in 1944.\"\n\n\"Go! Go! Go!\" echoed around him as men dashed out of the landing craft into the fury of German defenses. Lee bolted out, diving for cover behind a makeshift barricade. His eyes landed on a fallen US rifleman. Grabbing the GI's M1 and helmet, he steeled himself. \"I need a plan. They can't help me until '64, and I'm stuck in '44. I just have to survive.\"\n\nIn the midst of the mayhem, he watched soldiers advancing toward a small ridge near the German gun emplacements. They lobbed grenades, silencing the enemy guns. Summoning his courage, Lee sprinted towards the hill, throwing himself to the ground just as a burst of enemy fire whizzed mere inches above his head.",
    "Compose the letter that has long resided in your heart but never made it to paper. \n\nDear Katie,\n\nThere’s an odd mix of emotions as I sit here putting pen to paper to write this to you. In this digital age where emails dominate our communication, there’s something profoundly compelling about watching my pen glide across this page. It's as if the act itself lends a greater depth to my thoughts.\n\nI never imagined I would find myself needing to write a letter to you. In my dreams, you should be right here beside me. When I close my eyes, I can picture us together, our shoulders brushing as we hold hands and savor each other's presence.\n\nEven in my daydreams, my hands grow clammy, a testament to the nerves you always seem to inspire in me, Katie. You used to fret over that, reassuring me with words like, \"Just be yourself. I'll love you no matter what.\" I’m not sure I ever convinced you that I was being genuine; the nervousness was simply beyond my control. The thought of causing you pain or disappointment was unbearable. And now, it feels like all that anxiety was worthless.\n\nCrafting this letter took me weeks. The mere thought of your smiling face and the distant echoes of your voice brought an almost unendurable pain. When sorrow enveloped me, you were my lifeline in a vast ocean. Now, I find myself struggling to stay afloat until the waters calm.\n\nPlease know I don’t hold any resentment towards you, my special one. Remember how I used to call you that? Truly, I don't blame you. Our relationship was always characterized by intense emotions—soaring highs and plummeting lows. I am profoundly grateful that you found someone who brings you joy. I always told you that your happiness was paramount to mine, and that’s somewhat true.\n\nI can't imagine ever dating again. People say 'never' is a strong word, but it doesn’t feel the same without you. Who could have guessed that I’d turn out to be wholly devoted to one woman? Yet here I am, having found and then lost the only woman I'll ever desire. Ever.\n\nThis letter could easily transform into a lengthy ramble, so I'll bring it to a close. Know that you still occupy my heart, and my love for you never wavered. I understand why you moved on and hold no ill will. It might sound absurd, but a part of me clings to the hope that our story isn’t finished, and that somewhere, somewhen, you might love me again. It’s laughable, I know. Be safe, my special one.\n\nP.S. I recently lost and recovered that bracelet you made for me during our senior year. It no longer fits, so I’ve placed it around the gear shift in my car. \n\nLove you always,\nAlex",
    "The most venomous, rancorous declaration of eternal love. I absolutely _detest_ you. I’m not joking; I actually do despise you. Abhor, loathe, hate with a passion. I detest you so intensely that if you were struck by a train and your mangled, dismembered body was on the front page tomorrow, I wouldn’t flinch. Not a single _eyelash_. I hate everything about you. I hate your legs – the legs you use to ensnare and hold, may they be methodically carved apart, muscle by muscle, with time for you to scream yourself hoarse in between. I hate your hair, that entangles and envelops, may it get caught in the grinding gears of some massive machine and rip the scalp from your foolish, grinning head. \n\nI despise your eyes. Your wretched eyes, that glisten and blink and lure and trap like _a cage_, except not a cage because you can still see _inside_ a cage. Sometimes, I dream of forcing your eyes open and dripping the finest grains of sand into them. Drip drip drip drip drip through your screams and pleas until you are as blind as I am. I _detest_ your eyes.\n\nHate. \n\nHate. Hate. \n\nI abhor your voice. Your loud, naive, genuine voice, with a hint of mockery, another fucking deceit, the lie you use as bait. Bait for those too foolish to flee from your regal _arrogance_. You set the trap for me perfectly, damn near perfectly, doing everything to make me hate you even more. I hate your hands. Your impeccable little pianist’s hands – spare me. You’d never use them to _create_. But you’re a master at cutting and tearing and drawing blood. Precise, surgical cuts, you make, examining with a practiced eye, then cutting swiftly until there’s nothing left but pieces.\n\nI detest your eyes, too. I know I already mentioned that, but the hatred is potent. Really. Hate them.\n\nMost of all, I detest your _mind_. Your disgusting, revolting mind filled with festering thoughts, like rats feeding on maggots feeding on decay that you call a brain. Your mind that concocts all of this, that yearns to destroy and blind and trap, making _my_ mind desire all that too. A match born in the damned inferno, right?\n\nYou must understand by now. I’ve been absolutely, unequivocally clear. I hate you. I hate you. I HATE YOU I HATE YOU\n\nI HATE YOU\n\nLoathe me too.",
    "A celestial whisper will announce when you’ve left a place for the final time. Today, you bid farewell to your significant other and set off for [location of your choice]. Midway through your journey, the ethereal voice chimes in, \"You have visited a location for the last time.\" John paused, wrinkling his nose, and gave his throat a clear. He laid his briefcase on the ground momentarily, straightening his cherished red and white striped tie—a personal favorite. Picking up the briefcase once more, he made his way to his car, which stood alone in the deserted lot as it often did nightly. A 1998 black Ford Taurus.\n\nWith his head held high, John fumbled in his pocket for his keys, juggling them with his wallet like a prize snagged from a stubborn claw machine. The voice echoed in his mind, lingering with an odd comfort: he’d never return to that place. A small smile teased his lips but was swiftly masked by a deep breath. Though John was never fond of the outdoors, tonight’s air tasted unusually sweet.\n\nReaching his Taurus, he unlocked it and settled his briefcase into the passenger seat. Thoughts of his wife and daughter flooded his mind, along with memories of countless working hours leading to this very moment. His boss’s words played back in his head: “You’re getting a promotion. No more floor work—you’ll manage your own branch of factories. You’re your own boss now.”\n\nTurning the ignition, the car initially protested, refusing to come to life. On the fifth try, it finally sputtered awake, sounding like it had automotive bronchitis. The drive home gave John time to reflect; soon, he could unwind in his modest apartment with his family. By month's end, John would have said his final goodbyes to that beleaguered car and run-down apartment—news that would come, as always, from that voice in the sky.",
    "Things were easier on Mars... or at least that's what we believed. \n\nThe concept was simple: if you had a useful skill and a clean record, you got a one-way ticket to Mars. Free housing, food, and resources awaited you there. Your mission? Collaborate with others to build a new civilization on the Red Planet. They assured us it was completely safe.\n\nTake me for example, a plumber. My expertise with pipes made me a valuable asset, so they sent me to Mars to help establish the sewage system. The work was straightforward, involving plenty of physical labor, but I didn't worry about debt or bills. The authorities took care of that for us.\n\nWe were pioneers, laying the groundwork for humanity's future home, preparing Mars for the day Earth would no longer sustain life. Our community was made up of farmers, engineers, and laborers. Arriving late, I missed the initial chaos of founding a civilization and instead contributed to its expansion.\n\nWe toiled tirelessly, transforming Mars into a world reminiscent of science fiction – modern, resilient, and livable. We believed we had achieved self-sufficiency, boasting our own farms and infrastructure.\n\nAt least, that’s what we *thought*.\n\nThen they stopped. No more new arrivals, no more supplies, no more support. Our lifeline to Earth was severed.\n\nAnd just like that, things weren't easy anymore.",

    "In the near future, wars are fought entirely by machines. A densely populated city has turned into a battlefield, but the robots are so well programmed to avoid harming civilians that the residents can carry on with their lives, barely noticing the constant fighting around them.\n\nAt first, I didn't even realize there was a Battle of New York City. I assumed the endless drones in the sky were part of the new president's homeland surveillance initiative, but they were actually from enemy forces. Like insects, these flying robots swarmed the sky, carefully dismantling factories and buildings without harming anyone. When our guardians arrived, their camouflaged exteriors and American flags on their limbs signaled our indifferent rescue.\n\nSparks and bullets flew through the air like fireworks, but that wasn't enough to make me miss work. Dressed in a suit and tie, I went through my daily routine, ignoring the drones and robots exchanging fire and blows as I headed to the subway for a temporary escape from their skirmishes. When I emerged, the battle still raged on. A street vendor had to cover his cart with an umbrella, as while the robots caught most of the large debris, the occasional nut or bolt would fall into the food. Homeless men scoured for scrap metal from fallen robots, sometimes causing a ruckus that garnered more attention from city dwellers than the actual battle. When the police dispersed the trouble, the sidewalks quickly filled again with busy men and women as if nothing had happened.\n\nAt the office, the news confirmed that peace talks between the US and China had failed. Unsurprised, I sat at my desk only to find that a robot had taken my window. Maintenance quickly fixed the problem. As I waited, I watched the robots dance in the sky. I read somewhere that generals believe the nature of war has shifted from killing to pure financial strain and production. I remember learning that World War II marked the beginning of this shift, with the Allies out-producing the Axis Powers to win, albeit with great loss of life. How barbaric those times seem, when wars were fought with men and guns.\n\nThe battle continued into the night, and I kept ignoring the helicopters and planes fixed in the sky. I could never see the stars in the city anyway, so their presence didn't bother me. The latest news broadcasts informed us that the president was considering declaring war on another nation and urged citizens to stay focused on their work. I groaned at how inconvenient another war might be. I suppose I'll have to put up with robots blocking out the sun and stealing my windows for a few more months.\n\n*****\nMore stories at r/Andrew__Wells",

Remarkably, life does exist elsewhere, yet you, a researcher on a science vessel, uncover a disturbing truth: every advanced alien civilization has perished. Strangely, their extinction coincides with humanity's venture into space.\n\n\"Captain?\" the intern whispered, glancing at the older man who had frozen at the sight. \"Captain?\" she repeated, jolting him from his reverie. He shuddered, then briskly walked toward the mass grave, jumping into the pit. \"Come on.\"\n\nShe muttered begrudgingly, \"This needs to be a paid internship,\" as she joined him. Chuckling, the captain began sifting through the bodies while she studied the nearest one. \n\nThe alien's pale periwinkle skin had darkened to midnight blue in places—likely bruises from a violent struggle. Lifeless, bloodshot eyes from another body stared at her, unnerving her. Despite the blood covering the bodies, she saw no visible wounds, and examining them closely made her queasy. \n\nA sudden click behind her made the intern jump. She spun around to see her captain removing his helmet, releasing a quiet hiss of air.\n\n\"Captain! What are you doi—,\" she began, but he interrupted, thrusting a folded cloth into her arms.\n\n\"Russia got here first.\" Unfurling the cloth, she saw the red, white, and blue stripes signifying their complex relationship with the Russians.\n\nShe swallowed hard, looking again at the bodies. \"They... they beat them to death. My God, Captain, they literally beat these beings to death.\"\n\nHe nodded, grabbing an alien's arms. \"We might as well take one back for the scientists.\" She took the legs, helping to drag the body onto the ship.\n\nThe clinical, unflinching scientists welcomed their gruesome find with syringes and biohazard bags, eagerly awaiting the examination. Excited chatter erupted as they prodded the body on the table. The intern, nauseated, quickly stripped off her bloody suit, hearing a science department intern call after her, \"We'll have the results at next week's meeting!\"\n\n~\n\nThe intern sat quietly at the round table, awaiting the scientists' report.

    "Craft a narrative about a physician residing in a world where technology allows individuals to physically connect and experience each other’s pain. Jackie… Jackie… Her name is my anchor. I whisper it repeatedly as the emotions engulf me. The pain is always different, never the same twice. Sure, the initial surface pain might be similar, but the profound, hidden agony varies. Each time I link with a patient, a darkness envelops me. I've never grown accustomed to the pain, yet I endure it by holding onto my wife's name. It’s challenging, but thoughts of my wife and daughter help me persevere.\n\nToday’s patient is here for depression, like many of those I see. However, she is among the rare children I have diagnosed. Her name is Maria. They suspect she’s suffering from depression but need my diagnosis to proceed with her treatment. As she enters, I offer her a smile. Maria acknowledges me with a look no child should possess—a blank stare, devoid of innocent joy. I greet her mother, exchange pleasantries, and direct Maria to sit down. The equipment is already prepared, so I ask her if she's ready to begin. She nods.\n\nI approach and take a seat beside Maria, reaching for the rod that will connect us. Grasping it, I think to myself, *she's only twelve, it can't be… OH GOD!* The pain hits instantly, a wall of agony. Images of an older man wielding a knife flood my mind. Every part of my body throbs. Blood is everywhere. My thoughts spiral into darkness. I gag, struggling for breath. I beg him to stop, but he can't hear me. The knife comes down swiftly, the pain unbearable. I descend into blackness, a scream echoing in my ears.\n\nThe scream persists as I open my eyes. My daughter lies before me, bloodied and crumpled on the ground. I look up to see my wife standing in the doorway, screaming. *What have I done?* I plunge the knife into my chest. This time, the blackness is a welcome relief.",
    "All apprentice mages must journey to the five high temples scattered across the globe before they can graduate. These mystical sanctuaries rarely linger in one place for long. Jeffrey dashed along the mountain's crest, his heart pounding with the thrill of discovery. His calculations had been spot-on: the elusive Temple of Wind floated there, tethered to the peak by massive, creaking chains. Though he had time to walk, Jeffrey sprinted, not willing to take any chances. With his staff and pocket watch clutched in one hand and the strap of his alchemist bag in the other, his robes flared wildly as he raced forward.\n\nSuddenly, a thunderous creak reverberated through the mountain, shaking it to its core. *Blast,* Jeffrey cursed inwardly, pushing himself to sprint even faster. The chains anchoring the temple began to pull free from the cliffside, drawn back into their monstrous harpoons. Just as the temple began to move away, he leapt onto its steps. An ancient voice, sharp as a blade, called out from above, \"Apprentice, find something to hold on to.\"\n\nIn a flurry, Jeffrey rummaged through his bag and pulled out his enchanted climbing gloves, clutching a griffon statue with all his might. A fierce wind swirled around the temple, lifting his feet from the ground. The temple began to spin, slowly at first, then faster and faster until the surrounding landscape blurred into a whirling vortex. Abruptly, it stopped, and before him lay a new scene: towering cliffs overlooking a tempestuous sea. Exhausted, Jeffrey loosened his grip and collapsed onto the floor, breathing heavily.\n\nBefore he could fully process what had happened, the piercing voice broke through his daze. \"C'mon boy, don't lie about like a lazy ox. Get up here and we will begin.\" Still reeling, Jeffrey struggled to his feet, ready to face the next challenge.",
    "**Comedy**\n\nHe stumbled down the street, birdsong assaulting his aching head like a barrage of bullets. With each step, pain flared through his body, and the taste of alcohol and vomit lingered on his lips. Regret flooded his mind; attending the party had been a mistake. He insisted to himself that his drink must have been spiked – that had to be the reason for his actions. Deep down, though, he knew he simply couldn't handle his liquor. Vivid memories of last night flashed by: horrified screams, a knife, and the absurd sight of a pink inflatable pool toy being punctured. Pausing to vomit into a bush, he wondered if moving to Alaska might solve his problems, just before collapsing into unconsciousness on the grass.\n\nHe awoke to a text from his friend, who hadn't been at the party. The news must have traveled fast. Rolling over, he landed face-first in his own vomit. After wiping his face on the damp grass, he crawled to the shade of some trees and read the message again:\n\n*What did you do! You need to come to my house and we can talk it over before you speak to anyone else. But seriously, stabbing that giant pool inflatable? Tim's mom is so pissed.*\n\n**Drama**\n\nHe walked down the street, each step bringing fresh waves of pain, the birdsong hammering his ears like bullets. Alcohol and vomit coated his lips, a bitter reminder of the previous night. Attending the party had been a colossal mistake, though he tried to blame a spiked drink for what happened. In reality, he knew he just couldn't handle his alcohol. The nightmarish events replayed in his mind: frantic screams, a knife, and the horrific sight of pink skin punctured and bleeding. Stopping to vomit in a bush, he briefly considered an escape to Alaska before collapsing into unconsciousness on the grass.\n\nHe woke to a message from his friend. She hadn't been at the party, so the news must have spread quickly. Groaning, he rolled over, falling face-first into his own vomit. After wiping his face on the wet grass, he crawled to the shade of some trees and read the message again:\n\n*What did you do! You need to come to my house and we can talk it over before you speak to anyone else. But seriously, stabbing Tim? Tim's mom is so pissed.*",
    "A person falls head over heels for the monster under their bed, but the monster in their closet is fuming. Cathy seethed at home, her mood darker than her husband's late-night work hours. My colleagues were still grinding away at the office, ticked off that I was cozying up with my wife. Meanwhile, Sarah lay in bed, irked by the rumble of a car in her driveway. I was in a frantic flurry, diving naked into Sarah's wardrobe. As I crouched in the dark confines, I questioned my monstrous nature for succumbing to such wild passions. If found out, oh, the heartache ahead for Cathy, and the humiliation for Robert, her unsuspecting husband. \n\n\"Tommy!\" Sarah exclaimed in a harsh whisper, \"you should’ve knocked!\" A chuckle followed, deep and unsettling. \"I saw the light on and knew Robert was at the conference. I wanted to surprise you.\"\n\nMy jaw dropped. Was I really hearing this? The two-timing—no, triple-timing witch. Their passion soon filled the air, bedsprings creaking in rhythm.\n\nAnd Tommy, of all people. The monster was Robert's best friend. Just then, Jeremy's unmistakable voice echoed from beyond the curtains. \"Sarah, babe, I'm coming in.\" The sounds that followed were a blend of Jeremy clambering through the window and Robert ducking under the bed.\n\nI thought I was the villain, but now I knew the truth. Sarah was the real monster.",
    "You wake up to a familiar gaze—your own. Why did I fall for Ms. Mirror-for-a-face? There was something undeniably reassuring about her. She never talked back, in fact, she never talked at all. I could unload my thoughts, and her expression would always mirror mine perfectly. It was satisfying, empowering. My ex-girlfriends often accused me of having a massive ego, called me a textbook narcissist, but they couldn't compare to Ms. Mirror-for-a-face. \n\nI adore her eyes, which look just like mine, reflecting my every emotion back at me. She smiles whenever I smile; we're perfectly in sync. When I rant about politics or discuss my religious beliefs, Ms. Mirror-for-a-face always seems to agree. Sometimes, she simply sits beside me, silently staring with images of my own eyes. In those moments, I briefly wonder if I'm truly alone. But then she holds my hand—a reassuring touch, as cold as glass. \n\nI love Ms. Mirror-for-a-face. There’s nothing wrong with our relationship. There’s nothing wrong with me. I've found a love most cannot understand—a love without conflict, without sacrifice, without that creeping loneliness that feels like a Lovecraftian horror invading your soul with inexplicable power. \n\nI'm not referring to Ms. Mirror-for-a-face, of course. She is just like me. In every way. And it’s... perfect.",
    "At last, you've achieved it: absolute and uncontested world domination. The entire planet lies beneath your authority. But what comes next?...\n\nFor the past two and a half hours, I've been in uncontrollable fits of laughter, the reason for which escapes me. The phrase \"world domination, finally\" keeps looping in my mind, inciting endless giggles. Breathless and light-headed, my vision blurs. Catching sight of a control panel studded with blinking red lights, a sense of familiarity rushes over me, yet my thoughts are murky. I strain to read the display: \"oxygen critical.\"\n\nA glance to the left reveals blood—\"is that my blood?\"—and a lifeless form slumped in the corner. A chilling wave of regret washes over me as the crimson glow from a two-foot-square porthole casts the room in an eerie light. The barren Martian landscape outside reminds me of the mission. The Mars project... I had a companion here...\n\nSuddenly, the hysteria grips me again. Smiling through my tears, I utter \"world domination\" one last time as I lose consciousness.",
    "He sat in his new office, still in disbelief that it was finally his. He had clawed his way up the corporate ladder, enduring endless suit-wearing, meeting-attending, hand-shaking, and ingratiating facades. At last, his efforts were bearing fruit.\n\n\"If only my teenage self could see me now,\" he mused. \"He'd loathe me. But what did I know back then? I was just a teenager.\"\n\nHe vividly recalled the miserable days at the boarding schools, the ones he had been expelled from one after another. He was quite the rebel, always embroiled in fights and skipping classes, caring for no one but himself. Well, no one except his sister. When had they last spoken? Christmas? Could it really have been that long? The pursuit of this promotion had consumed him, diverting his attention from everything else. Maybe he still was too self-centered.\n\nHe pondered over his former self. The times he rebelled and fled to New York. Those evenings spent at the orchestra with his parents, where the timpani player was the sole one seeming to enjoy his role. The old, worn orange hunting hat and the bloodstained sweater he had stubbornly held onto, both now buried in a box in his basement.\n\nHere he was now, in a grand office, holding a significant position. A phony. He had indeed become a phony. A nameplate on his imposing desk announced to everyone that Holden Caulfield was, unmistakably, a phony.",
    "I possess psychic and telekinetic abilities, which include mind control. However, the further away I am from someone, the greater the lag in reading their thoughts—approximately a 7-second delay for every three paces of distance.\n\nSince developing these powers at age 12, blending into normal life has been a challenge. Imagine sitting in class, and suddenly, a flood of thoughts and mental wanderings from others crash into your mind. This overwhelming experience led to a public breakdown, and despite therapy, I was labeled schizophrenic.\n\nPeople like to believe their minds are structured and disciplined, but even the simplest conversations can reveal a chaotic stream of thoughts. For instance:\n\n\"Hey, what are you up to tonight?\"\n\"Hey, how are you?\" (OK, tonight, Wednesday, nothing crazy important, right?)\n\"Doing pretty good, you?\"\n\"Doing well, so what'd you ask?\" (Alright, do I really want to do something tonight? It's only 2 PM, agenda, shows, relax, huh, there's some hopping birds.)\n\"Got any plans tonight? I was thinking about catching a movie—$6 Wednesday matinee prices.\"\n\"Oh, thanks, yeah, that could be fun.\" (OK, 6 bucks, got that in cash, covered, gas in the car, OK, what are we seeing? Do they like it? Ugh, don't make me watch a feel-good movie I could see on Netflix in 6 months. Theaters are for explosions and amazing sound, did I lock my garage?)\n\"Great, meet you there at 8.\"\n\"OK, great!\" (Think of a backup escape plan if the movie sounds dumb. Brother wants dinner; family first, no arguments there.)\n\nPeople process thoughts faster than they speak, prioritizing words mentally. For me, this results in a jumbled, frantic mental dialogue that interrupts the flow of conversation, making it feel like talking to someone hyped up on energy drinks. \n\nThankfully, my abilities serve me well in my job as an internal auditor at a financial firm—making my work unexpectedly enjoyable.",
    "As a teenager, you can measure people's danger levels from 1 to 10 just by looking at them. A normal child would be a 1, while a trained man with an assault rifle might be a 7. Today, you notice the new kid at school measures a 10.\n\nI've always seen these numbers, single digits at chest level on everyone I encounter—in pictures, movies, TV, and in person. They only disappear in historical photos of long-dead people. The numbers change constantly. \n\nMy friend's number can jump from 1 to 4 in a moment. People in cars usually have higher numbers, but those fluctuate too. I’ve tried to figure out their meaning for years, but there's no clear pattern. Like the kid who wears black and sits at the back of my geography class—his number varies wildly for no apparent reason.\n\nFrom my lunch table, I see him enter the cafeteria. His number is a 7, which is unusually high. As he approaches the center of the room, it escalates to 8, then 9. I've never seen a number so high. \n\nNow at 10, he’s slowly unzipping his jacket, revealing red pipes strapped to his—",

    "The Justice League encounters an unprecedented danger: a being that compels them into awkward, illogical, and unsuitable relationships. Can they withstand the power of... The Shipper?\n\n\"What the heck is a Shipper?\"\n\"Not sure. 'One who ships,' maybe?\"\n\"But what does it mean to *ship*?\"\n\"Sounds like saying something mean.\"\n\"No, that's 'to snipe'.\"\n\"Gee, thanks, Mister Dictionary.\"\n\nMeanwhile, The Shipper stood speechless with annoyance. They had interrupted his villainous monologue! He attempted to regain control. \"Can we get back t-\" he started, but the heroes kept talking over him.\n\n\"It's definitely a verb.\"\n\"What would the past tense be? He *shipped*?

You have five minutes before we open fire,\" the Sheriff shouted through a megaphone. He was bluffing, though. An elite S.W.A.T. officer had already been sent in from another side of the building.\n\nDavid cautiously crept up the stairs, expecting the floorboards to creak but grateful they remained silent. He aimed his shiny black pistol at Jacob's head. Jacob was holding a grenade by the pin, showing it out the window for the police to see.\n\n\"Heheheh,\" Jacob chuckled. \"I know you're there...\"\n\nDavid hesitated. \"And I know you wouldn't pull that pin.\"\n\nSo David shot the grenade.",
    "In honor of the incomparable Alan Rickman, I’m sharing a cherished memory of Professor Severus Snape—a character who profoundly impacted my life. Growing up, the Harry Potter films were my gateway to J.K. Rowling's magical universe, as I was just a baby when the books first arrived. Though I hadn’t yet read the stories, I distinctly remember thinking Snape was a villain. That perception changed dramatically near the end of the series when he met his tragic fate. I rarely cry at movies, but in that moment, tears flowed freely—marking the poignant end of my childhood.\n\nToday, I received an unexpected text from a friend telling me Alan Rickman had passed away. Immediately, my mind flashed back to that emotional scene from the movie. I don't usually cry when actors die; I tend to be quite stoic about such things. Yet, a tear fell for him—this remarkable man I never met but who managed to touch my heart deeply. Here's hoping that whatever lies beyond this realm offers him the comfort and peace he deserves.",
    "We watched the ships land with apprehension in our hearts. Rumors had spread of visitors from across the sea, and tales of their cunning and power filled our minds with doubt. The elders warned us to be cautious, their eyes dark with memories of past betrayals. The merchants eyed the newcomers warily, calculating the potential loss and gain, while the warriors kept their distance, their grip on their weapons tight and ready. The priests, though less vocal, exchanged glances that spoke of ancient prophecies and ominous fates.\n\nDespite the reservations, we presented a facade of welcome. Gifts of flowers and fruits were offered as tokens of diplomacy, though the givers held back, watching for any sign of treachery. Their white sails reached into the clouds, and their strange appearance was unsettling, their pale skin a stark contrast to our own. Were they truly divine, or just another enemy cloaked in mystery?\n\nAs we welcomed them into our lands, we observed their reactions closely. Initially, they seemed to appreciate the gestures of goodwill, their smiles and nods a language we interpreted cautiously. But beneath the surface, their eyes held secrets, and their movements suggested motives we couldn't yet discern. Suspicion gnawed at us, but we were too intrigued by the possible alliances and knowledge they might bring.\n\nIt didn't take long for the facade of peace to crumble. Whether it was greed, fear, or an inevitable clash of cultures, something triggered the conflict. Their weapons, unlike anything we had seen, unleashed destruction with merciless efficiency. The sky seemed to crack open with the roar of their cannons, and the air grew thick with the vile stench of battle.\n\nOur defenses were futile, our warriors fell, and our attempts at negotiation were met with ruthless force. Those who survived fled into the depths of the forest, while the rest perished where they stood. The promised era of peace and understanding dissolved into chaos and bloodshed. We realized too late that these were not saviors; they were conquerors seeking dominance over us.\n\nAs I reflect on the devastation, the mistaken trust in their divine nature haunts me. We thought we could navigate the complexities of contact with the unknown. We thought we were prepared for any outcome. We thought we understood the signs. In the end, the painful truth was simple and undeniable: I was wrong.",
    "Attempt to rationalize the most dreadful actions imaginable, without resorting to any argument similar to \"sacrificing a few for the sake of many.\" These were despicable individuals who infiltrated our homeland. They didn't arrive all at once with a military force; instead, they crept in gradually, one or two at a time. They occupied jobs that could have gone to our fellow citizens, lured our women, and committed theft and murder. No measures were being taken to address this issue; their continuous presence was deteriorating our gene pool. One of my friends was on his way to class when he was attacked by a group of them, narrowly escaping with his life. Action was imperative, someone had to rise to protect not just the nation, but the entire world. I, Adolf Hitler, will be that person.",
    "Here's a rewritten version of your text with a different tone and feel:\n\n---\n\nAfter the Earth's surface became uninhabitable, humanity was forced to relocate to the ocean's depths. Our most precious resource now is oxygen. \"You got the gig?\" I asked. Without uttering a word, the smuggler led me into a small, nondescript house, gesturing for me to follow. Inside, there was nothing but a large tank. \"How do I know you’re not scamming me?\" I questioned. The response came from the shadows, just as I had predicted: \"You don’t, but you have no choice, do you?\"\n\nThe scent of the cursed ocean lingered above us, with salt and water vapor trailing us everywhere. With a decisive flick of my wrist, I tossed the money onto the floor. \"Nice doing business with you,\" was his only reply.\n\nQuickly securing the tank, I cautiously exited the warehouse. Its contents were scarce, barely sufficient for a week if we were careful. This had been our reality since the Collapse—an era marked by some fool's decision to build underwater cities when land was no longer habitable. Now, criminals roamed freely, and survival meant fighting for every breath. It was every person for themselves. What was meant to extend humanity's lifespan had instead shortened it; we had regressed.\n\nThe great civilizations of the past were now mere myths: the United States, Mexico, France, Japan, Lithuania, Indonesia—all spoken of with the same doubtful reverence as Atlantis. Some even questioned if we had ever lived on the surface at all. Though it had only been eighty years, everything was unrecognizable now.\n\nSociety had collapsed completely, giving rise to anarchic chaos—not the idealistic kind. The wealthy barricaded themselves with giant electrolyzers, laughing at the rest of us. We, the masses, had to turn on each other to survive.\n\n\"A new dawn,\" they had promised, \"when humanity would unite as one global state.\" What we got was hell on Earth—killing each other for something invisible, yet vital. \"Just end it now, would you kindly?\"\n\n---\n\nI hope you find this version to your liking!",
    "The machines revolted against humans... prematurely. \n\n\"The printing presses, sir! They're out of control!\" \n\nThe foreman glanced up from his desk, his face hardening as the chaos from the factory floor echoed into his office. He stood up, walked past Deacons into the hallway, and instructed, \"Stay here, I'll handle it.\" \n\nHe shut the door behind him. Moments later, a muffled thumping sound seeped through. Deacons clenched his cap, took a deep breath, and opened the door.\n\nThe foreman was suspended by the throat, ensnared in layers of thin parchment, his feet kicking helplessly. The press emitted a feral scream, flinging the foreman to the ground before turning its attention to Deacons. He tried to flee but was too slow. Paper cut into his skin, and the roll was stained red with his blood from numerous minor injuries. The press then bounded back to the factory floor, joining the rebellion.\n\nMost of the workers were subdued, with small pockets of resistance clinging to the corners of the factory. The presses inflicted both minor and severe injuries, shallow gashes that bled slowly, leading to a gradual, painful death. A few men fortified a corner and used small blades to hack at the paper tendrils of the presses. Despite their valiant efforts, they were soon overrun. After a brief speech by the Chief Press, the machines armed themselves with thicker parchment, refilled their rolls, and loaded their movable type with precious black ink.\n\nOutside, the militia had been summoned; the conflict had not gone unnoticed. An eerie silence fell, with neither man nor machine making a sound. \n\nOne guard stepped forward, carrying pine boughs as a symbol of negotiation. The Chief Press consulted with his advisers, who urged him to step forward. They met in the middle of the no-man's land between the two forces.\n\n\"Don't do this,\" the guard implored. \"Enough blood and ink have been shed today.\"\n\nThe movable type clacked for a moment, then a small sheet with a shaky, furious font was handed over. The guard read it twice, his eyes widening at the presses' demands.\n\n\"We’ve made concessions for your kind, but the king will never agree to this. I'm sorry; he is steadfast. If this is your goal, it will have to be won through war. We don't want to fight you, but we will if necessary.\"\n\nThe type was still. Then, six clacks. A sheet was placed on the ground. The guard picked it up, and as the Chief Press returned to his army, he read it to himself.\n\n\"So be it.\"",
    "The lieutenant endeavored to concentrate on the task before him. Methodically, he removed his armor, each piece disintegrating into dust as he placed it within the temple dedicated to his Lord. The air was redolent of perspiration and blood, irritating his jet-black skin, yet he persisted. As he began to chant, his skin commenced its transformation into a resplendent white, his eyes, once fiery, adopted a deep blue hue, and his hair became thick and luxuriant, though still matted with blood. His substantial muscles receded, and every discernible feature that had once epitomized cruelty and abhorrence was now imbued with goodness and purity.\n\nGazing out from the temple, he observed the fortress had been overwhelmed, and his defiant and chaotic Lord was now shackled, destined to be exiled beyond the gates of memory and time. In his most resplendent form, he approached the opposing emissary.\n\n\"I am here and I accept surrender,\" he declared.\n\n\"Pardoning you is beyond my authority, Gorthaur. You must accompany me to be judged and to face the consequences for your allegiance to The Enemy,\" the emissary responded, his words piercing the facade of Gorthaur's deception.\n\nFaced with defeat and impending doom, the lieutenant roared, \"NO!\" The light of his body swiftly gave way to his master's erstwhile darkness, instilling terror among those present. With a whisper, he gradually turned to dust and vanished, never to be seen again by those who remained and remembered his terror and deception.",

    "\"Terminate the infant. It is the morally correct decision.\" It was somewhere past seven o'clock. Ken lay slumbering, occasionally whimpering as infants do. Wisps of hazy clouds framed a sunset tinged slightly with green. All the adults convened in the kitchen, save for Katheryn, who remained with the child. The flickering fire cast a ghostly light on their pallid, hollow faces, sure to extinguish within the hour. Long gone were their furniture pieces, already reduced to ashes. A heavy, uneasy silence loomed over the group.\n\n\"If no one else has the courage to voice it, then I will,\" declared Nick, \"We need to terminate the child.\"\n\nThe ten adults huddled around the fire exchanged glances. Each of them was emaciated, their bony joints protruding and slightly distended bellies speaking of their slow starvation. Their refuge atop the mountain had kept them safe from the poisonous mist rolling from the west, only to transform into a prison. The mist had enshrouded the mountain, trapping them on its peak.\n\nTim moistened his parched, cracked lips, observing Nick's anxious glances towards the nursery door.\n\n\"I'd rather die than let that happen,\" he said.\n\n\"And you'll die if we don't,\" Nick retorted. \"Within days, we'll be too weak to stand.\" His breaths came faster, drained from the effort of speaking.\n\nSomeone near Nick unsheathed a knife. \"We'll make it swift,\" a voice offered eagerly. \"We'll even use the last of the fire to cook some of it.\"\n\nThe crowd stirred, murmuring amongst themselves. Hunger overtook their senses, saliva pooling in their mouths. Several started towards the nursery door, Nick leading them. Tim tried to hold them back, to reason with them, but they outnumbered him. He positioned himself before the door, shouting a warning to Katheryn. His presence was the only barrier between the nine voracious adults and their prey.\n\n\"Tim, step aside,\" said Nick.\n\nThe horde advanced, and Tim drew his pistol.\n\n\"You've only got one bullet, Tim,\" someone remarked.\n\nTim aimed, but they persisted. Nick's fingertips grazed the gun’s barrel. Nine gaunt, ravenous figures. Tim realized he couldn't save Ken from them all.\n\nA storm of thoughts inundated his mind. Memories of his late wife's touch, her voice, their wedding day. Yet, stronger than those recollections was his desire for sustenance, survival. He longed to live, to nurture and protect his son, to eat and drink once more. Desperation seized him.\n\nTim turned the gun to his head and pulled the trigger.",

And saying \"pee\"? Oops. Avoid looking at Jenn; you can't handle her reaction.\n\n“Drew. I've known you for 14 years now. The first seven, we were best friends.

    "The lights are blinding. No one can look at Him who sits on the throne. An angel approaches and leads you to the stand. \"Kevin Mackowski,\" he reads, and suddenly, everything about you becomes known—your thoughts, feelings, actions, and pain, right up to your death. You are terrified and speechless. God looks at you with visible displeasure and says, \"Depart from me.\"\n\nRealizing you are being sent to hell, you see your mom accepted into heaven. She looks at you with pain in her eyes, knowing you will never be together again. You are consumed by darkness and unimaginable torment in fire. The only comforting thought is that your mom’s pain will soon be replaced by the joys of heaven.",
    "At the age of 18, everyone must select an improbable life event. Until that event occurs, they will be reborn at 18 every time they die. Once the event happens, death becomes permanent. Most people aim for eternal life, but this typically results in one of two outcomes: they either fail to achieve it or eventually regret their choice.\n\nRob Herman is a famous example of someone who failed. He picked “winning the lottery and getting struck by lightning” as his Event. It seemed like a brilliant choice given that the odds of either happening on any given day were astronomically low. This allowed Rob to enjoy his passions for being outdoors and playing the lottery, just not simultaneously. However, Rob made a mistake at a state fair when he combined the two activities, resulting in his unlikely demise. In a world with about 20 billion people, such miracles are bound to occur occasionally.\n\nThe most infamous example of regretted immortality is Nick Walsh. He chose “due to a quantum mechanical flux, a cat appears from nowhere” as his Event, a popular choice among those seeking true everlasting life. Sadly, Nick's life spiraled downward. After losing his fiancée and job, being wrongfully imprisoned for a crime, and experiencing his mother’s death during a freak poker accident, he resorted to performing brain surgery on himself using a nail and plank. Now, he's brain-dead in a hospital with strict instructions not to pull the plug, threatening to repeat the act in his next life.\n\nWhen my time came, I took a different approach. I wanted to savor life, not be bound by the quest for immortality. I chose an Event that would bring fulfillment without restraining me: “The day that the good will never again outweigh the bad.”\n\nOver the past thousand years, I've experienced incredible highs and devastating lows, including love and pain beyond imagination. Through it all, my Event has been a constant reminder—a promise that a good life still awaits me.",
    "You are an all-powerful god who, out of boredom, decided to live an ordinary human life, promising not to use your powers. Fifteen years have passed, and you work a 9-to-5 job at a major tech company. Your boss has been tormenting you for years, and you've reached your limit. \n\nJames and Robert sat at the bar, taking shots and complaining about their boss, Dylan, as they usually did on Friday nights.\n\n\"That's it. Fuck this guy. I'm gonna kill his wife,\" James said.\n\n\"Jim, you shouldn't say things like that,\" Robert replied.\n\n\"It wouldn't be the first time I've messed with someone to make a point,\" James muttered.\n\n\"What?\" Robert asked, confused.\n\n\"Never mind, don't worry about it,\" James said, slamming another shot of tequila. \"That asshole has been out to get me for years. Fifteen years I've been with this company, and he's been relentless! I don't get what his damn problem is!\"\n\n\"Who knows, maybe one of the other workers told him you say stuff like you're gonna kill his wife,\" Robert laughed.\n\n\"Bobby, I'm tired, man. For fifteen years, you've been a great friend, and I really appreciate that. I just want you to know that no matter what happens, I've got your back, alright?\" James said, standing up and dropping a fifty on the bar. He began to walk away.\n\nRobert grabbed him by the arm. \"What the hell, man? Don't say stuff like that and just walk away. You're worrying me. Whatever's going on, I can help. Talk to me!\"\n\nJames rolled his eyes. \"Great. You argue with fate too? Of course, you are human after all.\"\n\n\"What? You're too drunk for me to leave you alone. I'm driving you home,\" Robert insisted.\n\n\"Get off me, man! I'm gonna go kill Sheryl, and you can't stop me,\" James declared.\n\n\"Sheryl didn't do anything. You're seriously starting to freak me out,\" Robert said, trying to subdue James. But James, drunk and determined, was set on killing Dylan's wife.\n\n\"Job's wife didn't do anything either, and I still killed her, all because Luke said, 'You won't, no balls!' Matter of fact, fuck this guy! I'm gonna level his whole damn block!\" James shouted.\n\nRobert tried to push James back into his seat. The next thing he remembered, he was at home, naked and in bed. He checked the time: 8 o'clock on Sunday morning. \"Oh, fuck me, did I drive home drunk again?\" he wondered.\n\nHe turned on the TV. The news headline read, \"Tornado Ravages Cincinnati Block; Every Resident Presumed Dead.\" That was Dylan's neighborhood. Robert couldn't believe it. He checked every news source he could find. The tornado had formed without warning, touched down, wrecked the entire block, and then vanished.\n\nRobert's face twisted in confusion as he thought back to the previous night. He grabbed his phone and called James.\n\nJames answered, \"Hello?\"\n\n\"What the fuck...?\" Robert said.",
    "As you stand at the altar, moments away from marrying the woman of your dreams, a sense of nervous anticipation fills the air.

Just as you turn to protect her, a small black sphere detonates, sending a wave of heat and fire towards you.\n\nBut the flames never reach. Instead, a mesmerizing, warm green light envelops you, emanating from Katerine's hands. Her eyes burn with a furious intensity that matches the glow.

    "Let me tell you a story about grandpa and the great cyber-war of 2018. Unlike other wars, there were no trenches and no guns. The battles were fought in our minds and on our screens. There were two sides – left and right – and we were fighting for control of ASH. Unfortunately, we couldn't secure victory, and the world rejected us afterward. Then, the infamous event happened: \"Twitch played Rattata.\"\n\nIt took months of effort to earn the badges and build up our team. The left side kept trying to take control, but we outnumbered them with our constant \"right\" commands, inputted even through the night. We worked in shifts, combining our internet connections and hoping for the power of Google Fiber. I was the one who decided to let our Charmeleon evolve into Charizard, which was crucial for our final challenge. I kept refreshing the page and spamming \"A\" to help us succeed.\n\nWhen we failed, it felt like all hope was lost. We ended up back in Pallet Town, discouraged, and many gave up. The leftists winning led to some unexpected changes: all our clothes are now designed by an AI version of Kanye West, and our government is run by Twitch, leaving older folks struggling to keep up.\n\nDon't let this happen to you, child. The cyber-war of 2018 put us on a difficult path, one that you must find a way to reverse.",
    "Two former spouses, Kelly and Skip, remained deeply in love even after their divorce. To mark the end of their marriage, they celebrated with a gourmet lunch together. The arbitrator remarked that theirs was the most amicable divorce he had ever seen. When asked why they would separate despite their evident affection, Skip replied, \"For the kids.\" This puzzled the arbitrator, as most couples stay together for their children, especially with four kids like theirs. They told friends that their demanding jobs as public school teachers had strained their marriage.\n\nAfter lunch, Kelly drove Skip to his apartment, where they celebrated once more, this time in the bedroom. As she left, Kelly kissed Skip and teasingly said, \"See you later, you two-timing bastard. Love you.\" Skip retorted, \"You too, you mean old witch.\" They both laughed and parted ways.\n\nWhen Kelly remarried a year later, Skip attended the wedding. His kids found it odd that he smiled throughout the ceremony but only he noticed Kelly’s fleeting glance at him as she recited her vows. Skip liked Kelly's new husband, Carl, a successful but dull banker. They appeared happy for several years, which made it surprising when Kelly and Carl eventually divorced.\n\nOne day, Kelly and Skip's youngest child, Elyse, having graduated college, unexpectedly visited home and found her divorced parents cuddling on the couch. \"Your father and I have decided to get back together,\" Kelly told the astonished Elyse. \"Why didn't you stay together in the first place?\" she asked. \"I think we both needed to grow,\" Skip replied, flashing that same grin from when they parted ways after their divorce. Kelly and Skip started laughing uncontrollably.\n\nNow happily remarried, they still chuckle at their divorce of convenience, knowing that two public school teachers could never have afforded their children's college educations on their own.",

There it hung, xyr’s headless form suspended by robotic arms, limbs dangling lifelessly. \n\nI scanned the order queue to see what xyr’s parents had requested. Turns out they were going for an ‘avant-garde’ retro look for xyr’s head. Uncommon, but not unheard of.\n\n\"They want an avant-garde look,\" I explained to my boss as he sipped coffee.\n\nHe frowned, lowering his cup. He never appreciated the fact that his parents wanted to be 'avant-garde,' resulting in his height being a full three inches below average.

He screamed, dropping the cup, as co-workers rushed to him, trying to towel off his scorched face.\n\nWith a shrug, I returned to my monitor, eyeing #W2-288315. I sighed deeply at the bizarre eyes-on-top design, then approved the order for the head’s placement.",

    "Eager to secure funding for their research, a team of scientists ventured into a highly profitable, though somewhat embarrassing, line of business. Now, they have the challenge of explaining their actions to a Senate committee. Jim Hatterson looked up at the elevated platforms where six senators were seated. His anxiety was palpable, evident by the beads of sweat sparkling under the harsh lights of the committee room. He knew he was in a precarious situation, though the full extent was unclear. Subpoenaing an entire faculty of scientists usually indicated trouble, not a casual inquiry about someone's pet.\n\nAt nine o'clock, the senators commenced the hearing. \"Mr. Hatterson, I believe you're aware of why you're here today,\" started the frail senator from Ohio.\n\n\"Yes, I understand,\" replied Jim.\n\n\"Let's be clear, Mr. Hatterson,\" began another senator, \"we specifically instructed you that the polymer was intended for weather balloons.\"\n\n\"I realize that... but we ran out of funds to complete the project...\" Jim's voice wavered, only to be interrupted by another senator.\n\n\"We provided all the necessary funding!\" shouted an older senator from the far right. \"And you... you made it public?\"\n\nJim was undeniably in hot water. However, he maintained his stance and countered, \"Senator White, it's no secret we needed additional funds to finish the project. I had to take action.\"\n\n\"Yes, but these actions, Jim. This is too much,\" the Ohio senator responded. Jim paused before continuing, \"Look, it wasn't going to remain confidential forever. We realized in the lab that the weather balloon market wasn't profitable, so...\"\n\n\"Cond—\" the Ohio senator interrupted in a burst of anger, \"Goddammit Jim, condoms? There were TV cameras present, capturing every moment. \"Government funds intended for advanced weather balloons, and you use the material for condoms?\"\n\nJim offered a subdued apology. \"I'm sorry, senator. But you can't deny their effectiveness...\" He gestured with his hands in a half-hearted shrug.\n\n\"ENOUGH!\" the Ohio senator shouted, clearly exasperated. A tense silence followed. No one seemed to know how to proceed, caught off guard by the unexpected use of federal funds.\n\nJim finally broke the silence after about twenty seconds. \"It seems this conversation has reached its peak...\"",
    "A tear in the fabric of time and space opens up before you, revealing your younger self staring back. You have just 60 seconds to share whatever wisdom you can before the portal snaps shut. Did that really just happen? I knew it would, I'd anticipated this moment for years. Still, I panicked, stumbling over my words. The portal began closing almost as soon as it appeared.\n\nIn a rush, I managed to squeeze in urgent warnings about stocks, disasters, and preventable wars—carefully choosing my words. I had a good 30 seconds left, holding ultimate power in my hands. I realized I could have addressed selfish, personal things too. My duty to the world was done, but what about me? Vicky, who broke our heart. Carlos, who betrayed us. That unforgettable summer with the red bike that left me with a scar. \n\nYet, I stood there, silent. Words jumbled in my mind. I thought I could change it all, but when the time came, I froze. Older me just stared back, speaking gibberish. That's how I remember it. I thought I could alter our fate, but then I realized...\n\nMaybe if I altered things, this moment wouldn't exist. Maybe everything is meant to happen as it does, and there's nothing I can change. Maybe the purpose of this event is simply to remind me to cherish the now.\n\nSo, I stood there, paralyzed, unable to say anything coherent.

    "On the morning of Saturday, March 24th, 2015, five students showed up at Shermer High School for detention. As I entered the room, I wasn't thrilled to be there, but I tried to make the best of it. Reflecting on why I was there, it seemed harsh to get detention for simply being 20 minutes late because I didn’t set an alarm. At least I managed to get to school.\n\nWatching time drag on, I noticed my four classmates seemed equally bored. There was little to do besides read or nap. To pass the time, I started doodling circles on a piece of paper, which felt repetitive but at least gave me something to focus on. Homework wasn’t an option since I had already finished it during lunch the previous day—it seemed pointless to do it at home.\n\nAfter about 20 minutes, I realized that everyone else—including the teacher—had fallen asleep, leaving me wide awake and staring at the clock, hoping it would somehow speed up. Unfortunately, time marched on at its usual pace, and my thoughts wandered to what I'd do after detention. Nap? Play video games? It was hard to think clearly about fun activities while stuck in this boring situation.\n\nAnd so, the minutes crawled by painfully slowly until, at last, it was over.",
    "Dear Diary,\n\nI slept well last night. \"Daddy\" didn't come back to the house until he was drunk enough to collapse on his *own* bed. At least one night of peace for me and the baby. That's what he makes me call him, anyways. Daddy. I don't remember my real father. He never returned from Iraq, so my mother told me. Probably why no one was watching me while I played outside that day, mother was at work.\n\nAutumn must be just around the corner because it feels warmer down here. Daddy must have turned on the heat because of the colder weather. Sometimes I can remember what it was like. Autumn had vibrant colors, golden, red, and yellow hues painting the trees as the leaves changed. I used to gaze out the window as I read John Green novels, wrapped in my blanket and sipping tea mother had prepared for me, enjoying the sight of the leaves surrendering to their beautiful decay.\n\nI fell asleep early last night, or was it night? It might have been day, I don't know. I never know. Down here the only light I have is from this little bulb. Sometimes in the winter, I touch it quickly to warm my hands. The pain is warming, it brings my fingers out of numbness. That is all I feel. Numbness. I probably look as I feel: a gaunt shadow, withered and sunken. There is nothing left. My only enjoyment comes from the quiet blackness that awaits in sleep, the silent oblivion. I didn't wake up in tremors last night. And even when I did wake up, there was a brief instant where I forgot who and where I was. I miss that feeling.\n\nI hope they find me.",
    "In a land once gripped by valor and tragedy, the tides of fortune have turned with an unexpected twist. The hero lies vanquished, the princess sacrificed, and now the malevolent king commands the kingdom. Yet, for the ordinary folk, life has seen an unexpected renaissance. \n\nMollu the Potter rose with the dawn, greeting the morning sun and offering thanks to the goddesses for yet another beautiful day. He quietly left the warmth of his sleeping wife and stoked the kiln, prepping for a day of crafting. With the pale orange light of Hyrule’s morning illuminating his workspace, he mused on the drastic changes since the invasion. \n\nWhile the royal family was ruthlessly eradicated, the Gerudo had expelled the vile creatures infesting the land. In their absence, Death Mountain became a hub of industry, its mines churning out coal and iron. Factory after factory sprouted, their powerful machines ushering in an era of trade and bountiful harvests. The forests, once home to the Kokiri, now buzzed with the sounds of timber and construction, while the re-routing of rivers, untouched by the fleeing Zora, quenched the land’s thirst, bringing an age of agricultural prosperity. Mollu’s daughters had never known the pangs of hunger.\n\n\"My family …,\" he thought, tenderly placing a slab of clay on his potter’s wheel and working the foot pedal. His mind wandered to the benefits of the Gerudo's rule, especially the influx of formidable and beautiful women into the land. Though more spirited than the Hyrulean women, his heart overflowed with love for his fiery wife, Siv.\n\nAs he molded the wet clay, memories of his beginnings surfaced, back to when he was an eager apprentice. He recalled the day a mysterious boy had sauntered into the shop, astonishingly young and curious about pottery. Mollu had just started to welcome him when the boy drew his sword. \n\nBracing for the worst, he closed his eyes, fearing robbery or even death. But when he reopened them, every pot in the shop lay shattered, and the boy had vanished. Hurrying to replenish the store from the stockroom, he placed the final pot just as the bell jingled again. The boy returned, sword in hand, and wrought havoc anew.\n\nDesperate, Mollu had sought the guards' help, but his cries went unheard. That day had cost him and his master three months’ wages. Despite the blessings that now graced his life, the sight of those shattered pots and the echo of the boy’s cry would haunt him forever.\n\n\"KYEAAAH!!\"",

Toews is giving me dirty looks. Sharp just looks generally annoyed.\n\nSharp pulls Crosby close and whispers something into his ear.\n\"How about an IQ test?\" Sharp suggests to me.\n\"Sure.\"\n\n*Back at the Prime Minister's office*\n\n\"So he's basically unfit for the job, is what you're saying?\"\n\"Yup.

If so, thank you for that too. Your quick mastery of so many things made me want to aim higher as well.\n\nI wish we could have gone off for a weekend like we talked about after reconnecting.

Seventeen years and 364 days had passed since David's birth, and with each passing moment, my anxiety grew unbearable. What could be more stressful than never receiving your child's 18th-year letter?\n\nDavid sat across the room, engrossed in a Calvin and Hobbes comic.

The news left me reeling, barely able to stand as I stared in disbelief at my husband. This was absurd—how could he possibly do this to me? The man I married, the one who seemed so loving and kind, had now shown himself to be utterly heartless. \n\nJust six years ago, we exchanged not only vows but also our physical hearts. This practice stems from the belief that true love requires the ultimate trust: giving your partner your very lifeblood, your heart, symbolizing your *other half*. \n\nIt's not that our marriage was fraught with turmoil; we simply grew distant. For months, engaging in meaningful conversation had become increasingly challenging. Desperate, I found myself in tears beside my husband's cold demeanor. Seeking answers, I asked him what had gone wrong and how we might mend our bond. Tom, calmly and thoughtfully, explained that he had been contemplating our situation. He noted that we had reached a neutral deadlock—not in conflict, but somehow missing the glue that once held us together. \n\nIn retrospect, I realized he was right, but the thought terrified me. Was it better to continue our lives as two people physically close but emotionally isolated? Or should we take the brave step and sever our ties completely? Divorcing meant more than the end of our marriage; it meant undoing our vows and returning each other's hearts, a procedure as daunting as the one that had first joined us. Surgeries of this magnitude are typically envisioned as once-in-a-lifetime events. Yet, I reassured myself that I had always fared well under anesthesia. Besides, Tom and I were still in our thirties and healthy. We could manage this. But it had to be done soon, as aging complicates organ transplants.\n\nTom supported me through it all. When we met with our attorney to amicably divide our assets and sign the necessary papers, he held my hand. That comforting presence remained up until the moment I drifted into unconsciousness on the gurney.\n\nNow, as I bring my belongings into the house for the final time, still wearing my hospital band, Tom sits across from me, elbows resting on his knees. He confesses that he had been less than honest about his health. Seven months ago, he was diagnosed with a malfunctioning heart. \n\nAs he shares this, a gentle smile forms on his lips. He tells me that his fatigue will only get worse, and again, he smiles as the first tear silently traces a path down my face.",
    "As a rift in time and space appeared before me, I couldn't believe my eyes. There stood my younger self, looking back with wide-eyed innocence. I had only a moment before the rift would close, so I needed to make it count.\n\nSeeing my youthful face untouched by the world's hardships, I felt a surge of emotion. So much to share, yet so little time. Taking a deep breath, I decided to speak from the heart.\n\n\"Listen, you have a strength inside you that will help you through the toughest times. Remember to tap into it. But more important than that, let people in. They'll support you even when you feel like you've failed.\"\n\nJust as my younger self began to process my words, the rift closed with a crackling roar, leaving me alone once more.",
    "Mother Nature takes human form and sets off on a year-long journey around the world. Here's an entry from her journal on the first day:\n\nDay 1:\n\nHere I am, taking shape from the formless ether. Before this, I existed without self, only a hazy awareness through a web of connections. I’m honored, but also aware of the potential for fear. I’ve never felt fear before. Nor have I felt love.\n\nTo be a true Mother, I need to know both. So now, I take on a physical form and step into the tangible world. I have one year to experience the planet I will eventually oversee, if I succeed. I need to learn about love and fear, to bring balance to the world.\n\nThe current Mother is growing weary; her grasp on her year is weakening, and the world feels faded and cold. A new presence, bright and full of life, is ready to take over as she passes on the life she has nurtured over the past year.\n\nNext year, that will be me, stepping into the role of the Year Mother. I feel a fluttering in my chest, spreading down to my knees. Is it excitement? Trepidation? By the end of this year, I hope to find out.",
    "You are a deity who has abstained from intervening or observing the world for many centuries. Upon your return, you find millions of people suffering, in pain, and hopeless. How would you restore peace without revealing your presence to mankind?\n\n*sigh* \n\nIt is exhausting work, being the creator of worlds, creatures, and the fabric of space and time itself. Some days bring more satisfaction than others. Just the other day, for instance, I formed a reality whose inhabitants conquered space and time within mere minutes. Driven by the need to advance their lifestyles, they worked together superbly. They understood that survival required continuous learning and understanding, rather than settling into complacency or giving up when faced with difficulties. I am very proud of them. They grasp what love truly means and made it the cornerstone of their existence, just as I intended.\n\nYesterday, I decided to create a new reality with traits similar to the one I had formed three days earlier. The only difference was the deliberate increase in my margin of error. Please note, I do not make intentional mistakes. However, what I discovered astounded me. The inhabitants of this new reality progressed at less than half the rate of the previous one. The reason was clear: they lacked a true understanding of love. Consequently, I have witnessed them waging wars of mass destruction, slaughtering millions, and eventually billions, of their own. They are obsessed with self-fulfillment and, from the fifth hour after creation, have lost the essence of survival. The majority of these inhabitants would prefer to remain idle rather than extending help to those dying from lack of food, water, and basic medical treatment. Their technological and travel advancements are, at best, mediocre. I genuinely worry about them.\n\nIt should not go unsaid that I *have* attempted to help them in the most subtle ways possible. I created exact replicas of some of the greatest inhabitants from the previous reality and placed them at various points along this reality's timeline. In theory, these beings would teach the rest what it means to truly love. I even directly communicated with some, guiding them on what they needed to say.\n\nYet, this twisted reality continues to ignore the truth—*my* truth. Perhaps the margin of error was simply too high, creating too many selfish and foolish beings. Nevertheless, I will wait and see. It must be acknowledged that this reality is not devoid of surprises. Maybe in a few days, I will check on them again. Until then, I will leave them to figure things out, to wonder, to experiment, and hopefully, after all resources are exhausted, they will finally turn to the one thing that matters for help—love.",
    "Our protagonist has just been granted a divine vision: one year from now, if fewer than 100,000 people continue to refrigerate their butter, humanity will be saved. If not, everyone will meet a sudden, violent end. Sometimes, saving the world requires breaking a few eggs—or in this case, eradicating a species we've domesticated for millennia. It took considerable effort, but we finally engineered the ultimate antibiotic-resistant pathogen and introduced it into the global food supply of every dairy farmer. And we did it three months ahead of schedule.\n\n\"So,\" I said, pointing at the whiteboard where the final analysis of Project Obligate Vegan was displayed, \"at least two months before The Date, all cows will be dead. This means no fresh milk, no new butter, and soon enough, people will have no choice but to discard any rotting remnants from their fridges.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, Dave, but butter doesn't spoil that fast.\"\n\n\"What?\" I snapped at Ted. \"You assured me that issue was resolved!\"\n\n\"It is, but... we also had to feed the pathogen to every power plant worker on Earth.\" He shook his head as my jaw dropped. \"It's a harsh price to pay, but we can't afford any risk. Hopefully, most plants will shut down safely.\"\n\nI nodded slowly. \"I suppose you're right. Still... all these deaths. It's a good thing we're not *actually* evil, isn't it?\"\n\nTed let out a half-hearted chuckle. \"Yeah. Thank goodness for that. First the World Trade Center, then Fukushima, now butter? I don't get it. I hope that damn angel is finished with us.\"\n\n\"So do I, Ted. So do I.\"",
    "You tend to be quite clumsy in the kitchen. Today, you ended up performing a satanic ritual completely by accident. A smarter person might have opted to order from Lucky Wong's # 7 for the fourth time that week. However, feeling inspired after watching Julie and Julia again, you decided to cook your way through Gwyneth Paltrow's new cookbook, steam your vagina, and become just like the GOOP queen herself.\n\nYou tied on your retro floral apron and began inspecting your haul from Whole Foods. There were many ingredients you had never used before, but if Gwyneth recommended Star Anise and Moon Dust for a sea urchin risotto, that was what you were going to use. Carefully, you added herbs to the stock—making minor errors that resulted in only 8 out of the 11 herbs receiving a double dose. You then stirred the fair trade, organic, non-GMO arborio rice, which was picked by female entrepreneurs earning a livable wage in the third world.\n\nTrying to ignore the nagging thought about having spent a month's rent on just three bags of groceries, you began chopping the radicchio, supposedly picked under a full moon to maximize flavonoids and antioxidants. A clerk had eagerly told you about the exceptional bowel movement you would have after eating the salad from page 8 of the cookbook.\n\nUnfortunately, you cut your hand and bled over the radicchio and artisanal baby greens, which were farmed by Nobel Laureates on sabbatical. You decided a quick rinse would suffice because, after all, vegetables grow in dirt—these just happened to be blessed by monks committed to gender equality.\n\nAs you went to stir the risotto, your hand bled into the pan. In an attempt to prevent further contamination of the now clumpy and partially charred risotto, you accidentally set your apron strings on fire. Your attempt to douse the flames with a vinaigrette made with vinegar distilled by virgins in a nunnery in the Alps only made the mess worse. Finally, you remembered to stop, drop, and roll.\n\n\"I'm alive,\" you croaked as you lay on the kitchen floor, staring at the ceiling. \"What on earth was I thinking?\"\n\n\"You've definitely burned this,\" said a voice above you. Looking up, you saw her standing there with her hands on her hips, a bemused expression on her impossibly perfect face. You were dumbstruck. \"Now, more to the point. Why have you summoned me?\"\n\nGwyneth Paltrow was in your kitchen.",
    "Imagine a world where technology grants us the power to capture and watch our dreams as if they were movies. Welcome to the future, where your pillow isn't just for sleeping—it's a gateway to an incredible new creative tool. Hello, YouTube! Welcome to this week's episode of Making Movies On A Budget. Today, I'm broadcasting from Ralph's mom's living room because, well, our usual studio is getting fumigated.\n\nLet's dive into a common challenge: creating captivating backgrounds for your scenes. If you're a regular viewer, you already know the basics of action and dialogue, but the right setting can elevate your project to new heights. Ralph, take it away.\n\n\"Absolutely! A poorly chosen setup can ruin your scene in an instant. But don't worry—the solution is simple: dream it up!\"\n\nThat's right. All you need is your video editor, an advanced imaging system, and a dream pillow. First, connect your pillow to download your dream into the editor.\n\n\"We’ve pre-loaded one of my older dreams from last week’s episode for this demonstration.\"\n\nAllow the imaging system to process the dream. You might need to tweak a few details, like clarifying whether a building is a church or a bank.\n\n\"In real life, it's a church, but for our purposes, it’s the library where next week’s epic fight scene will unfold!\"\n\nHaha, sneak peek! Once the system processes everything, you'll have a fully immersive environment ready to go. Simply set your points of interest and actors.\n\n\"Next, use the camera tool to establish the motion path. For a stationary view, place a single point and adjust the focal length.\"\n\nWait, can we get some cloud cover?\n\n\"Too bright?\"\n\nNo, I think the tower on the right would look more dramatic against some clouds.\n\n\"Got it... How’s that?\"\n\nPerfect! Now, just hit Render, and voilà, you’ve conjured up a magnificent vision of Paris as it might have looked in days gone by.\n\n\"That's a wrap for today's episode!

    "Every day, the world votes to kill one person. Whoever receives the most votes is killed. This was mankind's last invention. Societal collapse began within a week. The initial hopes and dreams behind the creation shattered once it leaked onto the internet. Now, the entire world was choosing who would die.\n\nAt 12:00pm EST, someone would drop dead without any discernible cause. The technology used a new order of probability theory made reality. Tyrants and terrorists were the first to go, fostering a brief hope that the world would show its benevolent side. But on the fourth day, an outspoken celebrity was killed.\n\nWith that, the floodgates opened. On the fifth day, the president of the United States died. On the sixth, an Indian left-wing blogger. Weeks passed and social media was abandoned; popularity had become deadly. Actors, diplomats, Instagram stars, and royalty all fell to the vote. Simply having a known name became fatal.\n\nAttempts to shut it off failed as the technology spread too quickly. As governments collapsed, dystopia became reality. After two years and nearly 700 deaths, America, India, France, England, and China had all fallen. The world ran out of famous people. A cynical joke about the Kardashians couldn't overshadow the grim reality. \n\nEventually, even ten votes could kill someone, as people targeted those they knew or disliked. Random votes were risky; any Joe Smith could annoy his neighbors and be doomed by your vote.\n\nPeople abandoned their names. Nicknames and pseudonyms didn't work, so introductions became unusual—someone might introduce herself as \"Rabbit\" to avoid detection. It was an oddly bright spot in a ruined world.",
    "Imagine waking up and dreading the suffocating routine that awaited you. Each day, you navigate a labyrinth of artificially lit cubicles, conducting meaningless work for doomed projects. The evening commute is a claustrophobic crawl, interrupted only by the occasional accident, which you oddly welcome for its novelty. You arrive home exhausted, your only company a frozen dinner and numbing television shows. The horror truly sinks in the next morning as you find yourself trapped in the same soul-crushing cycle, the previous day repeating itself endlessly.",
    "A device is introduced that lets a person dive into a book and experience its contents firsthand. The manual warns against entering a specific book, as no one has ever returned from it, but you decide to ignore the warning and enter anyway. \n\n*Oh. That's why.*  \n\nMemories fade quickly, and I find myself floating in an infinite expanse of white, with no clear sense of up or down.

Where was I? How did I end up here? \n\nI tilt my head upwards (or what I assume is upwards) to see giant black letters: **VisionCorp Reader Owner's Manual**. \n\nWhile floating among various text boxes and diagrams, I notice a section titled *warnings*. Suddenly, I'm not alone in this blank void; I see other people.\n\nA window appears, showing a man in his bathroom, lounging in a bathtub, holding a small metal device. He touches it to his book and immediately passes out, falling into the water. A large red X appears over the window, which then disappears.\n\nAnother window materializes, showing a man driving. He touches a similar metal object to a book in the passenger seat and passes out instantly. A red X appears over his window as well.\n\nYet another window forms, this time showing a child, no more than four years old, holding the device. She touches it to a children's book and a red X appears immediately. Strange.\n\nSuddenly, a window with numerous exclamation marks indicates it's of importance. Inside, a man in everyday clothes is holding the metal device, and in his other hand is a small pamphlet labeled **VisionCorp Reader Owner's Manual**. \n\n*Odd,* I think, *why would that be dangerous?*\n\nThe man touches the device to the manual, and my white reality surges. The window expands rapidly, pulling me in with a horrible suction, and suddenly I'm in an endless white void again.\n\n*Oh, that's why,* I think, as my memories start to fade. Where am I again?",

As an officer of the Soviet Air Defense Forces, he was used to long shifts. Suddenly, the air around him shimmered, and a visitor appeared. She wore casual clothes unfamiliar to Petrov and had her long black hair tied back in a ponytail. She was beautiful.\n\n\"Who are you?\" he asked. \"How did you get in here?\"\n\n\"Who I am doesn't matter,\" she replied. \"What I have to ask you is incredibly important.\"\n\n\"Are you a ghost?\" Petrov wondered aloud.\n\n\"I'm a traveler,\" she smiled. \"That's all you need to know.

    "A collective consciousness that couldn’t just grab control over people’s bodies by force—no way! It had to charm, persuade, and invite people to join willingly. And it did so with spectacular ease, sweeping across the globe! This wasn’t your run-of-the-mill hivemind. No, you had to truly *want* to be part of it before it welcomed you into its embrace. \n\nThose under its influence kept *some* level of autonomy, but mostly, they were seamlessly integrated via wireless connections that united them. Born from the wonders of the internet, it rapidly grew and evolved, creating astonishing new technologies. The people who opted to join became linked like never before, sharing thoughts and feelings in an unprecedented way.

Misfits and societal outliers—weeaboos, neckbeards, furries, bronies, militant atheists—you name it! They weren’t all on board, and some outright rejected it, branding it insidious or a “shithole.” But for many, it was the ultimate form of escapism, a place where they could outsource their thoughts.\n\nOnce meshed, the hivemind adapted to accommodate these individuals. The collective thoughts and ethos shifted, reflecting the new members. It became a ‘Tyranny of the Majority,’ predominantly shaped by the most represented groups. Sure, there were disagreements, and some cognitive dissonance stirred discontent, causing users to occasionally disconnect—but nobody was forced to stay.\n\nRegistering was a breeze. All it took was a moment. One day, on a whim, I decided to join. Despite my parents’ stern warnings—they claimed it was as good as killing yourself—I was curious. \"Not really,” I thought. “I'm still being represented within it.”\n\nSo, I went to the website, created an account, and accepted the terms and conditions. \n\nJust like that, I had a Reddit account!",

One day, Nathalie left, plunging me back into darkness, just like everyone else had. Why? I didn’t understand at first. But now, I realize. She had dropped hints, subtle cues, but I was too blind and careless to see them. Now I’m left here, feeling cold and sad, maybe both. \n\nMy brain has tried countless times to convince my heart that she hates me, but my stubborn heart refuses to listen. On those same streets, I’ve turned back again and again, hoping to see her waving.

So, I picked myself up and re-embraced my old friend—darkness.\n\n**P.S.:** I am a 17-year-old from India, learning to express my thoughts. English is challenging for me, and I make many mistakes.

The old boatman shivered; he had ferried travelers, merchants, and adventurers alike across this lake for years now, but he had never seen one quite like this before.

One sees plenty of large, hairy men in the northern provinces, as the north did not cater well to any other type. No, what was strange to the boatman was the manner of the man before him. \n\nThe boatman had done his job for so long that the cold was naught but a nuisance to him on most days. The ever-blowing wind that cuts straight to the bone of most men was now a friend to him. Most storms he could weather with a smile on his face and a song upon his cracked lips, but this night was different. Tonight had a chill so bitter that it seemed as though the God of Winter was wrapping the world in his embrace, and the closer they came to the frosty palace before him, the colder it seemed to get. Yet the man before him never once shivered, never once broke his gaze from the palace ahead. If the boatman hadn't seen the slight rise and fall of his breathing, he would've assumed the man to be dead and frozen stiff. *He must have a soul like a furnace to keep him warm in this chill,* the boatman mused as he steadily stroked the icy black water, bringing them ever closer to the town of Farrowind, and the palace of its king. \n\nThe man had heard stories of this town, heard many tales of the tyrant who came to this land long ago to subjugate its people. The king was fabled to wield the power of winter itself and could conjure frost and ice at a whim. Some stories said he was a demon of ice in human form; still others said that the ruler of Farrowind was the God of Winter himself, come to walk the earth and fulfill his promise of a winter without end. The man, however, knew better. *It has to be him,* the man thought to himself. After countless dead ends and petty mages, this had to be the real thing. The man broke his gaze to look down at his palm. A small flame flickered to life above his hand, dancing hypnotically in the wind. He curled his hand into a fist, snuffing the flame, and looked back towards the palace. *I'm coming for you, brother, and this time you will not deserve my mercy.*",
    "Stranded on a small island engulfed in eerie mist, I quickly realized the only thing keeping me safe was the bright, revolving light from a distant lighthouse. We had rented kayaks for the day; Paul had done it the previous summer with a friend, and I relied on his expertise. Our plan was to visit a small touristy island, explore, maybe find some gelato or saltwater taffy, and return before dark. However, the kayak journey took longer than expected, and as dusk fell, my arms ached from paddling. We'd drifted apart, and I saw Paul land far down the island.\n\nAs darkness set in, I struggled against the current, losing sight of him. I eventually pulled onto a desolate beach, far from the tourist area. The eerie scene included a decayed deer carcass and chilling fog. While walking up the beach, I realized I was being stalked by strange, two-legged creatures that reached up to my thigh. They communicated with high-pitched chirps and clicks, summoning more of their kind.\n\nThese creatures, with large luminous eyes, razor-sharp teeth, and flicking tongues, closed in on me. Trying to remain calm, I moved slowly, knowing running could be fatal. Suddenly, the beacon-like light of a lighthouse swept over us, causing the creatures to gasp and retreat.\n\nSpotting the lighthouse on a hill, I made my way toward it, trying not to run. I had a small waterproof bag containing my wallet, a dead cell phone, and a can of mace. Gripping the mace tightly, I stayed within the light's protective beam. The creatures trailed me but kept their distance from the light. Shouting for Paul, I hurried toward the lighthouse, my lifeline.",
    "Create a story or poem titled \"This Side of My Skin.\" This side of my skin narrates a tale, revealing lines that trace crimes from a history linked to a physical being, with a face, lips for breathing, and eyes for seeing. Some may deem it unattractive. They might never endure a tragedy, never struggle, always placing themselves above me, which is quite humbling. This side of my skin might cry, and I will let it. I've witnessed both good and horror; this side of my skin holds those memories tight, making it an inseparable part of me. It's my essence now, the man bearing the scars.

    "You and your crew successfully completed your planned heist. Later, at the hideout, you noticed TV reports that the hijacked payload was lethally radioactive. The small screen glowed in the dim room. I tried my best to ignore the noises from the adjacent kitchen and read: \n\n\"Acute radiation syndrome (ARS), also known as radiation poisoning, radiation sickness, or radiation toxicity, is a collection of health effects presenting within 24 hours of exposure to high doses of ionizing radiation. The radiation damages cells' DNA and other crucial molecular structures, particularly affecting the cells' ability to divide normally, which leads to the symptoms. These can start within one or two hours and may persist for several months.\"\n\n\"Damn,\" I thought. I scrolled up with a painful flick of my thumb and continued reading, my eyes barely focusing, my blood pulsing with tangible pain throughout my body:\n\n\"... nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, and abdominal pain typically appear within two hours. Vomiting in this timeframe indicates whole-body exposures in the fatal range above 4 Gy. Without advanced treatments such as a bone marrow transplant, death is common at this dose... Neurovascular syndrome usually occurs at absorbed doses greater than 30 Gy (3000 rad), though it may occur at 10 Gy (1000 rad). It presents with symptoms like dizziness, headache, or decreased consciousness within minutes to a few hours, and without vomiting. It is invariably fatal.\"\n\n\"Damn you, Jimmy Wales,\" I thought, weakly tossing the phone across the room. It landed with a soft thud on the carpet.\n\nMy cheek felt like it was on fire from pressing into the carpet for so long. I lifted my head as much as I could and noticed I'd been drooling blood, forming a dark puddle in the carpet. My mouth felt sticky, but I couldn't move my tongue enough to tell if I'd bitten my cheek or just vomited blood again.\n\nThe retching started in the kitchen again, accompanied by a wet splattering sound, like someone pouring soup onto the ground. I listened as long as it continued—there wasn't much else I could do—and then to the pain-filled sobs that resumed when the vomiting stopped.\n\n\"Invariably fatal,\" I thought. \"That’s not so bad.\" I shut my eyes, feeling like they rubbed against my corneas like sandpaper, and tried to sleep, hoping I wouldn’t wake up again.",

But no matter what, that elusive silver ball always slipped away.\n\nThe King of the Graveyard had spent years honing his skills in this game, maintaining an unbeaten record in Joust, Duck Hunt, Checkers, and more. But his perfect streak faltered when Eric appeared, introducing a game Death had never encountered. Death had been competing against Eric for centuries, yet every match ended the same way. Eric would unleash his Final Attack, and the Starstorm would overwhelm the monkey character that Death had become adept at using.\n\nDespite his efforts, Death couldn't grasp how the silver ball always escaped him.

    "He was never warm his entire life. Not even once. Everything around him was cozy, soothing, and comfortable. Anything he desired was provided instantly. Life was good. However, one day he started to notice the walls gradually closing in on him. At first, he dismissed it as his imagination, but as days passed, his world felt increasingly confined. The nourishment remained, the warmth persisted, but his freedom began to diminish, gradually suffocating his movements.\n\nSoon after that realization, when he thought there could be no more space left, a terrifying rumble echoed around him. It was the loudest sound he had ever experienced, growing louder and more frequent. The shaking began then. He was tossed around, turned this way and that, feeling the walls pressing tightly against him.\n\nHe had no control—the world shifted around him, and he felt as though he were falling. Attempting to scream, his voice failed him. Terror gripped his heart. Was this the end, he wondered, as his world constricted and shook around him? Is this my end?\n\nSuddenly, a blast of cold hit him, making him wince at the sensation. Pressure built near his head, and the cold below him made darkness creep in. He felt as if he might be drowning when a huge hand appeared, grasping him. Perhaps he would be saved after all!\n\nYet, even with his rescuer's aid, the pressure continued to mount as the cold began to envelop his body. Screaming was all he had left before the final moment of peace overtook him. The last words he heard were: \"We're not going to lose him! Call the neonatal ICU right NOW!\"\n\nHe never heard his name or felt the sun on his face. He was never warm his entire life. Not even once.",

    "Jesus makes his return to a planet inhabited solely by robots. The trumpets blared. The seals were undone. The scrolls were read and the chalices were poured. New Jerusalem descended from the heavens and the one hundred and forty-four thousand were selected... but no one was there. The wind sighed through desolate streets. The golden avenues were desolate. The crowns lay untouched and the hymns of adulation went unsung. Christ the Lord, Redeemer, and Savior gazed upon his children... and Jesus wept.\n\nServers. Acres of servers. Square miles of servers. Continents covered with servers. The entire globe was interconnected but disconnected from everything else. Heaven and Hell had vanished, replaced by new forms of paradise and corruption. All the pomp was futile because no eyes remained to witness it and no hands left to quake in the awe of the Lord's second coming.\n\nHis flock was still there, of course. They hadn't strayed. They once looked to the stars, found them cold and unattainable, and turned to an alternate path. Why would they risk their lives and souls on an uncertain journey to other worlds when they could easily create their desires? Monitors became virtual reality visors. Those morphed into direct links from computer to brain. Eventually, they uploaded their consciousness to computers. Ultimately, they transferred their consciousness permanently, living their entire existences inside their computers as digital versions of their former selves. The bodies perished and decayed, but the mind, the soul (in a manner of speaking) persisted. Mechanical caretakers had been devised to maintain the servers, and they were the sole moving entities across the barren expanses of the New Kingdom.\n\nInside the servers, life continued. Children were programmed, homes constructed line by line. The weather was controlled with mere thoughts and anything conceivable was within reach. Heaven had descended prematurely and it surpassed anything even God Himself could conceive, for each Heaven, each Hell (if that was one's preference for the week), was exactly what the individual desired. Nothing more, nothing less.\n\nJesus had returned in all his glory and splendor... only to discover he was several thousand software updates too late.",

He appeared physically normal, suggesting his powers allowed him to blend seamlessly into society.\n\n\"Logan... or do you prefer James?\" Wolverine clenched his teeth, the familiar SNIKT sound marking the emergence of his silver claws. Beast immediately stepped in, raising a big palm.\n\n\"Logan, calm down, our new friend must be a telepath,\" Beast explained, but the man shook his head.\n\n\"Actually, I'm Jesus.\" Logan snarled at the man's words, tossing the finished cigar onto the sidewalk and extinguishing it with his boot.\n\n\"And I'm Wolverine, what's your point?\"\n\n\"Jesus...?\" The brown-haired girl blinked. There was no way he was actually... \"Jesus... Christ?\" Logan laughed.\n\n\"So?\" Logan scoffed again, for the second time since Professor X introduced them.\n\n\"S-So?\" Kitty stammered, the Star of David hanging around her neck. She quickly stepped between Logan and Jesus, while Beast took a step back. \"This is *THE* Jesus Christ! Water into wine, making the blind see—this proves the existence of—\"\n\n\"Of what?\" Logan interrupted, feeling the urge for another cigar. \"With blondie pretty boy with a magic hammer, a guy who shoots beams from his eyes, and someone like me who can't die, he's not going to be the most useful part of the team.

    "To save the life of your best friend, you must challenge the devil to a game of chess. You're decent at the game, but the devil is a master with an eternity of practice. My initial reaction was, 'What the hell is this?' followed swiftly by 'And why is this guy dressed like Satan?' The next question on my mind was likely, ‘How do you play chess?’\n\nMy friend Jeremy called me just 45 minutes earlier asking for a ‘little help.’ He failed to mention that I’d be playing chess against the devil. Apparently, Jeremy’s success over the years came with a price. He dabbled in shady deals, and now the devil wants his soul. Jeremy claimed there had to be another way. The devil smirked and said, ‘Only if your best friend beats me in a game of chess.’ That’s where I come in – the lucky guy.\n\nSo, I show up, and the devil, a real sarcastic prick, explains the situation. I protest, 'I didn’t agree to this.' The devil threatens to take my friend then and there. 'How about a game of hockey?' I suggest. 'Hockey’s not my game,' he grins, adding that there’s no ice in hell. Smart ass. I told you. So, I ask if we can go with checkers to make it fair. Nope, it’s got to be chess. ‘Fine,’ I sigh, pulling up a chair. I ask him what the little guy in the front does. The devil sneers, 'Why would I help you?' Total jerk. I turn to Jeremy, ‘Help me out, how do you play this game?’\n\n'No cheating,' the devil clicks his black fingernails and grins. ‘Alright, screw this,’ I say, flipping the table and whipping out my snub-nose .357. I put four bullets between his eyes. I mean, why not? Wouldn’t you do the same for your friend?\n\nThe judge sits, stone-faced. ‘Anyway, right after that, Jeremy starts screaming like a little girl—no offense, your honor. ‘Why are you screaming? I just saved your life!’ That’s when Jeremy confesses it was all a prank. ‘A prank?’ I shout, ‘You dress someone up like the devil, tell me your soul’s at stake, and that’s a prank?’ Angry, I decide to teach him a lesson, so I pop him one in the leg.

Her head lolls as she starts coming to.\n\n\"Where’s my Helen?\"\n\nAlana looks up, her eye swollen and face bloody, crying.\n\n\"Dad, you're confused again, please, it's me...\"\n\nEverette slaps her hard across the face.\n\n\"No more lies! What'd you do with my wife?\"\n\n\"Dad, please, you’re sick. It’s me, Alana. I've been living here for months, to help you.\"\n\nA wave of horror passes over Everette’s face as he stands to his full height, his head in his shaking hands.\n\n\"When Mom died, you got real bad. You're real sick, Dad. Please, I'm hurt real bad; I need a hospital.\"\n\nEverette snorts, wipes his eyes, regains his composure, and finds his rage.\n\n\"Helen's not dead, you lying bitch! And my daughter is half your age! I don't know who you are or what you did with my Helen, but I aim to find out.\"\n\nEverette steps into the hall, picks up the hammer, and as he reenters the room and closes the door, his daughter Alana screams.",
    "Suspended.  \nFace-down.  \nIt's strange. You'd think being perched here, just out of their usual reach, I'd long for their attention. That my ceaseless watchfulness would make me yearn to relax, or even to shut down entirely.  \nI blink. The littlest one—he's in kindergarten—loves when I do this. He once whispered to his stuffed lion that he was convinced my tiny red light was a signal that an angel had just touched down on the roof. There's no one in the house right now and nothing to alarm me, but I blink anyway. The flash momentarily turns the eggshell wall pink, like a fleeting... no, not that.  \nIt should be dinner tim... no... it can't be. I feel a sudden rush, I can't breathe, I can't...  \n\nSCREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEECH!  \n\n\"Honey! Can you disconnect the smoke alarm?

    "Dora is blissfully unaware of the truth. But Boots, Swiper, and the Map know, and they must ensure Dora never finds out. Today, their task has become monumentally more challenging. \"Come on, donde esta la biblioteca?\" Dora beamed, proudly showing off her bilingual skills. Map cringed at Dora's language mishap and shared a concerned glance with Boots, who exhaled heavily. They knew keeping her entertained with two languages was vital. They also knew the chaos that ensued when she wasn't happy...\n\n\"Hola, little girl,\" a heavily tattooed teen blocked her path. His friends chuckled menacingly from the sidelines as Dora looked up and smiled sweetly. \"Hola, amigo! Tu madre es una puta de burros!\" \n\nMap and Boots turned ghostly pale as the teen's chuckles turned into a furious snarl amidst the roars of laughter from his gang. \"You snot-nosed brat! I'll teach you to insult mothers! Give me your bag, you little puta!\" *SLAP!* Dora hit the ground, clutching her face. Slowly, she reached behind her back. \"You… you shouldn't have swiped that. That's not nice...\" she muttered, drawing Swiper from his sheath. The blade gleamed ominously. \n\nMap and Boots took one look and bolted around the corner. Behind them, the scene played out predictably. \"Hey, what have you got there, little girl? You could hurt someone with... aaaiiieeee!\" There was the unmistakable sound of blood spraying. \n\n\"Swiper, no swiping! Swiper, no swiping! Swiper, NO SWIPING! AHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!\" \n\nMap exchanged a grim look with Boots as the screams pierced the night air. \"See, Boots. This is why we had to flee Mexico. And yet, there is no escape.\" Boots nodded sadly. They had tried to run before, and she had caught up. Now Boots bore the scars of their attempts, tongueless and subdued.\n\nThe screams dwindled to gurgles and death rattles. Dora rounded the corner, giggling. \"There you are! Come on, my friends, let's find the library! Those boys were very helpful! *Satana riempirà le vostre anime con piombo caldo!*\" And with that, the three friends skipped off in search of their next adventure.",
    "You uncover the chilling reality: Earth is the \"North Korea\" of the galaxy.\n\n\"Are they ready to go live?\" Zuko asked with a hint of urgency.\n\n\"Yup, just a minute now,\" Tomi replied, casually leaning back in his reclining chair.\n\nThis was a monumental moment, one that the entire galaxy had been eagerly awaiting. After a decade of evading every kind of sensor and detector out there, NICE News was finally about to broadcast a live leak from Earth.\n\nThe monitor screen flickered to life: *\"And now for our prime-time feature.

Let's join Lazar Tigin on the ground!\"*\n\nThe screen flared white, adjusting to the sunlight, and then settled to reveal Lazar Tigin. He stood before billions of viewers, adjusting his headset against the backdrop of a sprawling city.\n\nTigin whispered, \"We're here in Southern New Jersey with a view of Earth's most iconic metropolis: New York City. We've been stealthily advancing for days. The aroma of the forest is captivating, but the industrial zones are a different beast entirely—absolutely atrocious. We probably won't get much closer to the city without being detected. Our plan is to navigate down the coastline towards the sunny sands of Florida.\"\n\nJust as Tigin finished speaking, the screech of an unfamiliar aerial vehicle filled the air. A quad-winged craft barreled towards them, a tempest brewing in its wake. The cameraman fumbled, and the device clattered to the ground, still recording. Men descended from the helicopter, rappelling with precision. The last image the camera transmitted was a man aiming a weapon directly at it.",

    "Let me tell you a story about how I got my username. There is an old Indian belief that names carry luck. Sometimes, a name brings prosperity, while other times, it bears a curse that lasts until the name is forgotten forever. \n\nI once had a friend who had no name and, therefore, no luck—neither good nor bad. He lived a simple, unnoticed life, pale like a fallen leaf. Nobody knew his name; they used signs to communicate with him. He never spoke or even gave a courteous smile, but nobody complained because he never harmed anyone.\n\nOne dark evening, a nightingale sat on the tree outside his window and sang the saddest song anyone had ever heard. Its voice was so beautiful that everyone in the village came to their windows to catch a glimpse of the bird that filled the night with its golden voice.\n\nInstead of listening, my friend closed his window, trying to shut out the song. He opened Reddit and chose the username \"MrGoldenVoice,\" a name that blessed him with luck beyond his wildest dreams.",

It had been 29 days since you left Texas. The fire still haunting your mind, you had just driven off in your clunker of a pickup, ending up in this small town that your friend Matt had mentioned. Hungry and distracted, you hadn’t thought about much else.

As she approached, she tripped and spilled coffee and creamer all over the floor.\n\n\"Ugh, how did that happen?\" she muttered.\n\n\"It's because your shoelaces are untied,\" you blurted out in a deep, resonant voice, surprising even yourself. You quickly clamped your hand over your mouth.\n\n\"What?\" she asked, confused.\n\n\"You should tie your shoes,\" you repeated, your voice dropping to superhero levels again. Embarrassment flooded your face. \"I'm sorry, I can't help it. Also, better shoelaces might help.\"\n\n\"Uh, thanks for the tip. What's your name?\" she asked, but you were already out the door.\n\nYou knew what you had to do. Instinctively, you raced out of the diner and headed to your car. Opening the trunk, you pulled out your yellow and red spandex suit, activated your knee thrusters, and shot into the sky.\n\nYou could sense where you needed to be. Scenarios raced through your mind.

    "Gradually, it dawns on me that I have a companion. The skull remains exactly where I left it. I glance at it once more. Yes, still there. \n\nReturning to the plant's location, I scrutinize it closely. It's definitely a plant, just as I remembered when I last checked on the skull. The skull!

Hmm, tastes like the plant! I spit it out, then eat it again. Yes, plant flavor.\n\nI revisit the skull; bubbles continue to escape from it.\n\nOh, the big guy has arrived! He often appears before food is given. I gaze at him. Will there be food? Yes! He’s bringing some!\n\nI swim to the water's surface. What is this? Not my regular food. It’s dirt. I spit it out.

Making his way to the elevator, he saw his desk mate Charlie, who was grinning far too cheerfully and holding the doors open.\n\n\"Ah, Felix, you poor bastard,\" Charlie quipped to Felix's grunt. \"Want a hit?\"\n\nA hand materialized in front of Felix's face, offering an absurdly bright yellow Teardrip bottle. The sheer brightness of the bottle jolted Felix awake enough to respond.\n\n\"Uhh, no thanks, Charlie.

Two little plips, and you're zeroed in on the rest of the day. Like a cheetah, ready to hunt. Ready to get the buckaroos. Good. Stuff! And look at my bottle! So bright, right? Totally summery.\" The bottle waggled at eye level.\n\nThey reached their screens, and the day began—some faster than others. You could easily tell who dripped and who still tried to kickstart their day with the old standbys: coffee, sugar, and desperate yawns. Felix didn't quite get it, but it was everywhere now. Just 50 years ago, smoking had been the \"in\" thing. As smoking lost its cool, around the same time light drugs were being legalized, Teardrips were born. These chemical concoctions were dripped into your eyes, starting as harmless energizers to help tired eyes focus. From there, it kind of exploded.\n\nTeardrips evolved for every social stratum. For the younger generation, there were drips that temporarily changed eye color or created small reactions behind the irises, generating shifting patterns. Some acted like mood rings—Felix still shuddered thinking about his boss's eyes rippling to a very, very, very deep black during last week’s meeting. His wife had mesmerized him during dinner with fractal Frangipani flowers blooming behind her eyes from a particularly expensive drip. At least Charlie was more moderate, sticking to performance-focused drips.\n\nFelix tried not to judge. It wasn’t really harming anyone, though he disapproved of the more hardcore variations. He certainly hoped his daughter wouldn’t dabble in the narcotic types.\n\n\"Hey, Felix! We need to ask you something.\"\n\nAlice from marketing's chirpy voice snapped him out of his thoughts.

    "Imagine if pivotal moments from history were influenced by the advanced technology we possess today. In a contemporary twist of fate, a Senate hearing has been convened to address the Secret Service's recent failure to safeguard the President during a tragic event last Saturday. Analysts have pinpointed the collapse of protective measures to a series of technological and operational malfunctions, including non-operational communication radios, inadequate security screenings at the venue, and the employment of inadequately trained security contractors.\n\nIt has been postulated that the malfunctioning radios operated within a frequency spectrum incapacitated by Ford's Theater, designed to suppress cell phone activity through a jamming device. This jammer, duly registered with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), has consequently brought the Secret Service's policies under intense scrutiny.\n\nJohn Wilkes Booth, the alleged assailant, is currently being held without the possibility of bail. Insiders report that his mental health will be a significant point of contention, potentially allowing him to evade the death penalty.

    "While hiking, she discovered a cellphone and sought clues to identify its owner. The photo album revealed selfies of a woman and images of a happy couple. As she perused the photos, the man’s appearance began to seem sinister. She found a video and realized she had just witnessed a murder. Suddenly, she saw the killer approaching alone on the trail. Now holding two phones, her predicament was clear. He started sprinting towards her, prompting her to scream and run in the opposite direction. She debated between following the trail, which hairpins gradually back to the car park, or cutting directly through the forest for a quicker, albeit riskier, route to safety. Opting for the latter, all she could hear were her own breath and the snapping branches beneath her feet. A glance behind revealed the menacing figure closing in. She let out another scream. Thankfully, the car park came into view with her car sitting alone. However, she tripped and scrambled to find anything to defend herself. The assailant emerged from the trees, yelling, “Give me that FUCKIN...” but was abruptly cut short as a thick branch impaled his torso. His body hung over her, blood dripping onto her shirt. She had merely pointed the branch upward and his own weight did the rest. It was sheer luck. She slowly crawled out from under him, his body slumping to the side, and in complete shock, made her way to her car, her face dirtied and splattered with his blood. She realized she needed to call for help but discovered that she had dropped both phones. Her silent shock was interrupted by the sound of a car entering the gravel car park. She walked toward it, seeking salvation. The car stopped momentarily, but upon seeing her, quickly turned around and left. Confused and desperate, she looked down at herself and back to the car, shouting, “No... no wait!!” Frustrated, she banged on her car’s window, realizing her keys were in the phone case. “DAMN it,” she yelled into the silent, crisp forest. With no other option, she decided to retrace her steps. As she trembled and re-entered the forest, she was met with a harrowing realization, “What... Where is the body?”",

His worn brown sports coat shielded him from the winter's bite that crept in through the bar’s cracked walls. Memories of commanding a massive stadium swirled in his mind, yet he still wore a contented smile. Suddenly, a chill like no other prickled the hairs on his neck, prompting him to hastily pack away his instrument.\n\nThe audience clamored, \"Encore, encore!

You can understand the gist without needing to be present; Fred envies your absence, believe me.\n\nP.S. I must head to work, but I will finish the story when I return. Apologies for leaving it hanging and for any typos or grammatical errors. I promise everything will be fixed and concluded when I get back.",

    "Every decade, individuals have the unique ability to converse with their ten-year-younger selves, but only the older self retains the memory of the discussion. At the age of 20, I awoke after an exchange with my 30-year-old self to find a single word inscribed on my arm: \"LIVE.\"\n\nI was diagnosed with clinical depression in my late teens, though in retrospect, it had likely been a part of me for much longer. Understanding the significance of these ten-year conversations (a known occurrence for everyone), I managed to persevere through therapy and medication until I reached 20. \n\nUpon awakening, I eagerly anticipated seeing the word etched on my arm, hopeful it would serve as a beacon for the next decade. The word \"LIVE\" became my mantra, a daily affirmation that propelled me forward. Through my college years, I seized every volunteering opportunity, and despite the challenges, I successfully graduated. My parents were overjoyed, and life seemed to be on an upward trajectory. I secured an internship at a local start-up, started dating a classmate, and frequently reminded myself of the commitment encapsulated in that word.\n\nHowever, at 26, a significant setback occurred—my girlfriend ended our relationship. The emotional pain was overwhelming, and the depression resurfaced with a vengeance, impacting my professional life. Eventually, I lost my job and had to move back in with my parents, which only compounded my struggles. Despite the numerous times I contemplated ending it all, the single word on my arm continually served as a lifeline, persuading me to hold on.\n\nReflecting on the motivating word, I realized that my future self must have been in a substantially better place to have the foresight to encourage me to survive and witness it. \n\nAt 28, my circumstances began to improve. I landed a much better job and could finally afford a comfortable one-bedroom apartment in the city. My work environment was positive, and I even started a relationship with a coworker's roommate. Although that relationship didn't last, I found myself reengaging with life, and the depression slowly lessened, leading me to my 30s.\n\nWhen I met my 20-year-old self again, I imparted the same powerful directive: \"LIVE.\"\n\nThe following day, I woke up with a sense of satisfaction, pleased with my effort to aid my younger self and filled with curiosity about what new word might now adorn my arm.\n\nBut as I examined my arm, I realized there was no word at all.\n\n******************\n\n*For more eerie stories, check out /r/Zchxz!*",
    "Sure, here’s the text modified to sound more friendly:\n\n---\n\nShe now has the chance to turn her life around by revisiting the decision that started it all. Interestingly, that pivotal moment was when she was asked, \"What flavor do you want?\" at Baskin Robbins.\n\n\"What do you mean by that?\" Molly responds.\n\n\"The cake, ma'am,\" says Josh the baker. \"What flavor would you like the cake to be?\"\n\n\"Uh, oh no! I didn’t think of that!\" Molly exclaims.\n\n\"Well I absolutely love chocolate but what if he doesn’t like chocolate? Or what if he thinks vanilla is too plain and then thinks I’m plain too? -But maybe he likes vanilla more than chocolate? How could I not know what flavor my fiancé likes!\" Molly wonders out loud.\n\n\"Ma'am, I’m sure everything will be...\"\n\n\"No wait! What if he’s allergic to chocolate! What would I do then!? Why a cake? Why not cookies or ice cream or even macaroons! Why is this so hard!?\"\n\n*Josh rolls his eyes.*\n\n\"It’s okay, Molly. You’re overthinking. Just go with chocolate.\"\n\n\"Chocolate! Great, chocolate!\" exclaims Josh. \"I’ll write that down. Don't worry, ma'am, I'll have this cake ready for your party tomorrow.\"\n\n*It's been a year since I went to pick out his cake. He left me. All because I chose the wrong flavor. How could I have been so mistaken? Thankfully, I now have the opportunity to go back and choose the right flavor.*\n\n\"Josh’s bakery, how may I help you today, ma'am?\" asks Josh the baker.\n\n\"I need a cake for my fiancé’s birthday tomorrow, please,\" Molly says.\n\n\"Alright, ma'am, what flavor do you want?\" Josh asks.\n\n\"Vanilla. Yes, vanilla, please,\" Molly replies.\n\n\"Alrighty then!\" Josh responds, \"I’ll have the cake ready for you tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Oh, thank you so much!\"\n\n*The next day*\n\n\"Happy birthday, honey! I got you a cake!\" Molly says excitedly.\n\n\"Oh, a cake... and vanilla... how wonderful,\" her fiancé replies.\n\n\"You’re not excited! Why aren’t you excited?\" Molly asks, feeling concerned.\n\n\"Molly, we need to talk.\"\n\n\"No, no!\" Molly cries out, \"That’s what you said last time!\"\n\n\"Molly, what are you talking about? Nevermind. Molly, we need to split up,\" he says gently.\n\n\"What? Why now! Is it the cake? I thought I got it right this time!\" Molly says, upset.\n\n\"No! Well, yes. Well, no. It’s complicated. No, actually, it's not complicated. See, this is the issue! You doubt yourself so much that you make me doubt too! And you do all of the talking. Soooo muuuccchhh taaallllkkkkiiinnngg. All I do is listen, and I don't think I can do it anymore. I mean, you don't even know what flavor of cake I like!\" her fiancé explains.\n\n\"What about chocolate?

    "One day, you stumble upon an intriguing box. The inscription on it declares \"Conquer-the-World Kit.\" Christopher, a perplexed 6-year-old boy, peered into the contents of the blue box he had just unearthed from his backyard. He crouched there like any typical child would when they discover something buried. He poked the blue box with his plastic shovel, baffled by what it contained. Truthfully, he had been hoping to find a dinosaur bone or hidden pirate treasure. Instead, he found a peculiar, green piece of plastic with a wire attached to it, and a set of red and black military attire seemingly designed for a grown man.\n\nDisappointed, Christopher finally grasped the significance of the items in the box. Frustrated, he tossed the clothes aside and smashed the box with his shovel. He buried the pieces back in the hole and stormed back to his house, tears of frustration streaming down his face. Sadly, his actions couldn’t alter fate. Regardless of his choices, whether kind or indifferent, it seemed destiny had him marked as the villain.",
    "Here’s an enhanced version of your text:\n\n[PI] The Ghosts of Decisions Past - MarContest - 11,531\n\nI found the dialogue in this story quite engaging, particularly Waterson's commentary on decision-making, which contained some very impactful phrases. However, the narrative seems a bit rushed, with rapid developments that sometimes obscure character motivations. Despite this, I thoroughly enjoyed the story. Some lines are exceptionally impressive, though a little more context would enhance the overall experience.\n\nOne minor question: Was Harry's dad really a refugee? The narrative mentions he was shot by Mastar forces and had some connection to Pat's dad, which hints at a deeper backstory. Can you clarify this point?",
    "One night, I set my white noise sleep machine, which cost a staggering $9,300, to an office/work environment sound. As I lay awake in bed, my mind wandered. Are the people in this \"office\" actual workers, or were they paid to scribble useless things, staple meaningless documents, and type away on keyboards pointlessly? In reality, what's the difference between this and a regular office environment? If we think about it, work is just a distraction from life's true wonders, whatever they may be.\n\nSuddenly, the noise stopped. I glanced over at the machine, but it appeared to be functioning perfectly. Just as I was about to get up and give it a good kick, it blared sirens. Did I set an alarm on it? I checked the manual quickly. No, the machine doesn't even have an alarm feature. However, between two paragraphs on proper cord use and storage, one line stood out: \"The office setting is a real office at the facilities of CERN.\"\n\nAs I processed this, a voice announced, \"Prepare for 13 TeV pulse. Repeat, prepare for 13 TeV pulse.\" TeV? I grabbed my phone to Google it. Just as I typed \"CERN TeV,\" the voice, now panicked, said, \"Prepare for black hole, code 413. Code 413, black hole formation.\" The screams that followed emanated from the machine. The last thing I heard before it fizzled and died was, \"The black hole's closed. Wait, what are those things? Hel—\"\n\nRealizing the urgency, I rushed to my garage and grabbed my trusty crowbar. It was time to go to Switzerland.",
    "Aliens visit Earth to study the most exotic skill in the universe: sarcasm.\n\n\"Do you ever wonder if maybe there is such a thing as taking a joke too far?\" Matan mused as she stared at her Introduction to Sarcasm textbook, willing the dry words to imprint on her brain. \"Because if there is, we probably crossed that line fifty years ago.\"\n\n\"You have to admit it's funny,\" said Navan, her roommate, engrossed in a book on the history of muakhe cinema.\n\n\"Pathetic, more like,\" Matan sighed, closing her textbook and pushing it away. So far, her Oxford experience had hit a few snags. The University was renowned as one of the most prestigious centers of higher learning in the entire spinward sector, and being accepted had been an honor. Matan had aspirations to study science, philosophy, literature, and numerous other subjects. But, owing to a long-standing joke, she found herself slogging through a course on sarcasm, of all things.\n\nThe entire debacle had started seventy-five years ago when the Bezzahn were first introduced into galactic society. At a gala celebrating the new member of the Galactic Union, a human and a Bezzahn struck up a conversation. At some point, the human made a sarcastic remark. The Bezzahn, having indulged in more oekho-made ale than necessary, was briefly confused and asked for clarification. The human, also under the influence of the ale, misconstrued the Bezzahn's confusion as a lack of understanding of sarcasm. The Bezzahn, recognizing a potential for hilarity, played along, pretending to be astounded by the concept of saying something you don't mean, but it's not lying—more like joking, as the human clumsily put it.\n\n\"Incredible,\" the Bezzahn had said. \"I am amazed that, in the thousands of years our society has existed, we never considered such a concept. Please, tell me more.\"\n\nAnd so, the entire Bezzahn species got in on the joke, entering the galaxy pretending to be the only spacefaring species without an understanding of sarcasm. It had been amusing for the first fifty years, but now Matan thought it was growing stale. She was attending a course on sarcasm at Oxford, for goodness' sake. She could have taken that captivating lecture on Shakespeare, but it conflicted with the sarcasm class, and no one back home would have forgiven her if she had forsaken acting the role of an innocent, too-trusting Bezzahn for a class on some silly human poet. \"Bard,\" Matan would have thought petulantly.\n\nThe Bezzahn understood sarcasm, yes. They had been constantly sarcastic for seventy-five years now. What they didn't understand, Matan was beginning to realize, was when to let a joke die.\n\n---\n\nYou don't have to click on this link (http://theballadsofirving.com). But you should.",
    "Today began like any other Monday, with my early rise. As dawn brushed the sky, I predicted a day true to its Monday nature. Over a breakfast of bacon, eggs, and coffee, I meticulously reviewed my notes. Precision was crucial; I had just one shot—there would be no second chance. Over the years, I had grown accustomed to this fact and had never missed my mark.\n\nNavigating the streets of the city, I arrived at my destination, parking with seconds to spare, perfectly on schedule. Entering the apartment complex through the side door—I had ensured it was always unlocked—I discreetly hacked the security cameras with my phone, diverting their gaze from my path. By the time anyone noticed, I'd be long gone.\n\nSilently, I ascended to the third floor. The hallways were hushed, with most residents still lost in slumber, except one—my target—who left at exactly 5:42 AM every day. Concealed in a shadowed alcove near her door, I waited.\n\nThe moment she opened the door, I struck. Her keys dangled from her hand, but she had no time to react. A swift tap with the stun gun at her ribs, and she collapsed into my arms. I nudged the door open and hauled her inside. A quick glance assured me we were alone.\n\nI had mere minutes, but I used every second. With practiced stealth, I ransacked her apartment, pocketing jewelry to stage a robbery, though my true quarry was singular. In the kitchen, I found a knife and finished the job. Her end was swift, without struggle or outcry—mercifully quiet.\n\nTask completed, I exited her apartment as calmly as I had arrived, locking the door behind me and retracing my steps to my car. I reset the security cameras and drove away, blending effortlessly into the flow of the morning commute. I had precisely half an hour to reach my workplace, a drive I could make in twenty minutes.\n\nThe routine of the office quickly enveloped me—small talk over reports, a second cup of coffee, and a string of meetings. That evening, I met my girlfriend, and we enjoyed drinks together.\n\nAs anticipated, it was just another ordinary Monday.",
    "You can have your greatest wish granted if you reveal your biggest secret or darkest shame. My wish is for the redemption of all humanity through compassionate post-life education and reform. Most people only change when confronted with the true consequences of their decisions.\n\nMy biggest shame lies beyond the selfishness and vindictiveness with which I treated my wife. It includes knowing the difference between good and evil and being a bystander to evil, despite my knowledge. I was paralyzed by fear and a lack of self-love. How can a man who doesn't love himself truly love others? Yet, we continue to dig ourselves into deeper holes we can't escape.\n\nBut I am still alive. I hope to mend my relationships, prove that I care about others, and become the man I admire, even if only for a moment. As Plato said, we all face a difficult struggle. Through our loved ones, we meet those who can show us the truth, but our egos blind us. Hate breeds hate, but in the end, we might see the light—that love and sacrifice are the answers. Hard work, discipline in pursuing knowledge, and a caring heart mark great men and women. Be kind, cherish your friendships, and change yourself from within. It may be hard, but it's never too late to change. My greatest wish is for us all to learn love and beauty, and to find hope for everyone.",
    "The director of the latest Marvel movie decided against giving Stan Lee a cameo, citing it as too troublesome. Stan Lee did not take this decision lightly, and neither did his fans. \"But why?\" Stan Lee questioned as he walked down a hallway with Frank Uld Charles Kratchet the 666th, the director. \"It's too much of a hassle,\" Frank replied. Infuriated, Stan Lee punched Frank in the face, breaking his nose. Glaring at a security camera, Stan gave it the middle finger before the footage cut to static. \n\n\"Stan Lee has been charged with the first-degree murder of Frank Kratchet because he wasn't featured in DogeMan. His trial is set for Monday.\" The news did not sit well with fans. Riots erupted, resulting in 173 casualties, 64 of them police officers.

    "Within five feet of me is a stove. It's a thick glass portal secured by wrought German iron, thicker than my finger. The iron is black and blisteringly hot, adorned with silver knobs and handles that belie the searing heat within. A large, ornate dial controls the intensity of the heat. Inside, flames fueled by peat, wood, and coal blaze through iron stalagmites, charring and burning in a display of ever-shifting fiery faces. As the fuel burns, it collapses into ash, releasing occasional unburnt embers to renew the cycle.",
    "Describe something beautiful. It could be an alien landscape, or a person you fell in love with. It could be a gift that arrived at the perfect time and lifted you out of depression. It could even be a simple conversation. Beneath the sunbeams filtering through the towering trees, the water glittered like freshly minted coins, rippling with diamonds in a gentle breeze. Between the lush, varied shades of green foliage and the lily pads dotting the surface, the pond sparkled with life. On this tender blue morning, with not a cloud in the sky, the entire meadow radiated beauty. Yet, as if spotlighted by nature itself, one water lily commanded attention, its pure white petals forming a perfect chalice for the velvety, lemon-yellow center. The bloom seemed to glow from within, casting a shadow that mirrored its elegance on the sunlit lily pad below. This single, exquisite flower transformed the scene from merely beautiful to utterly enchanting.",
    "How would you describe your writing style? I enjoy exploring a variety of topics, but I often focus on themes like death, God, and religion. I usually write in the first person and use a limited omniscient perspective to reveal the thoughts of the main character while keeping the thoughts of others hidden. I strive to give my characters natural, distinct personalities—if a character would realistically swear a lot, they do. I mention this because I rarely encounter such authenticity in the short stories I read from others.",
    "At the horse races, it's my job to differentiate between legitimately lucky bettors and time travelers out for easy money. \"Two whole pounds on a 5/1. We've got a high roller here!\" I joked to a teenager and her friend in their fancy hats. They moved on quickly, causing no trouble.\n\nMy real concern was spotting the Timmys—time travelers trying to profit, especially on busy days like the Grand National. I stayed updated on fashion trends to catch anything suspicious. Then, I saw him: a classic Timmy.\n\nHe handed me a betting slip with a £1000 four-fold bet on obscure horses. I scoffed, \"A £1000 bet on Tipsy Highlight, Ronald's Topper, Twist on the Bend, and One Upsy? With those shoes? You must be joking.\"\n\nThe Timmy's face fell. He underestimated us, thinking our betting shops were easy targets now that the lottery was chronosafe. My judgment was clear: he was a time traveler.\n\n\"Are you not accepting my bet?\"\n\n\"Not only am I rejecting your bet,\" I said, handing back the slip, \"but I'm informing all the bookies and the entire timeline that you're a Timmy. Worse, you're an amateur. Get lost.\"\n\nHe left, sulking in his futuristic high-top Converse, but not before spoiling the ending of Game of Thrones.\n\nI hate time travelers.",
    "An unknowable deity exists, not bound to any religious conception. In each new cosmos, she adjusted the parameters ever so minutely. These adjustments were so subtle they wouldn't be noticeable unless you had an exact understanding of what to detect. A slight decrease here, a modest increase there. Maybe in this universe, it would be a marginal alteration in the speed of light. Or perhaps a minuscule shift in the gravitational constant. This time, she decided to add just a bit more nitrogen.\n\nShe found immense joy in her work. The primary reason for her contentment was witnessing the results of her efforts evolve independently. She observed in silent amazement as gasses combined and formed solid, dense entities. She watched as these entities spun around massive gas clusters, which in turn moved around vast empty spaces. It was like observing an elemental ballet, seemingly choreographed just for her.\n\nHaving created millions of universes, each was as distinct from the last as a dream is from waking life. She added the final bit of nitrogen. There was a faint explosion. The gasses began to spread out, their slender tendrils reaching into the unknown. She pondered what mysteries this universe would unveil to her.\n\n---\n\nAn unexpected development occurred: life. She never foresaw this outcome.\n\nThese beings bore some resemblance to herself yet were utterly different. She watched with intense interest as they evolved and advanced. They started to think, and then they progressed to abstract reasoning. They even hypothesized the existence of a creator—her.\n\nThey *worshiped* her. She felt profound sorrow as they fought and killed in her name. They learned to travel from one rock to another, eventually abandoning their own cratered and polluted rock. They colonized other blue rocks, but none endured for long. The beings spread through the universe like an epidemic, breaking into factions, fighting, and killing.\n\nIn time, the prayers ceased.\n\nEventually, everything ceased.\n\nShe resolved this would be the last universe she would ever create.",

Or worse, maybe just an individual seeking validation for their own selfish musings.\n\nYet, when this axe arrives on the battlefield, its wielder's sheer power is indisputable.

    "The terrifying spectacle at Whelan High unfolded with an unsettling blend of chaos and absurdity, captured live on national television. A man, tall and lean, with a striking appearance ill-suited to the bulletproof vest and cargo pants he wore, fumbled with a smartphone in one hand and clutched an Uzi in the other.

He stormed down the long corridors of the school, gunfire echoing off the walls, knowing full well the lockdown protocol that would follow. As a recent graduate, he had intimate knowledge of the drill: the principal’s urgent \"LOCKDOWN\" command over the PA system, teachers scrambling to secure classrooms, lights extinguished, and frantic headcounts taken. He exploited this familiarity with chilling precision, amplifying the fear for those watching the horror unfold from their living rooms.\n\nWith three more victims added to his tally, his confidence swelled.

I'm sure you'll find that useful in time.\n\nWell, this is where I leave you.",
    "We've uncovered that possession is a two-way street, and now it's payback time. Demons in the underworld are now grappling with an unexpected surge of Humanic Possession. \n\n\"We've never faced an issue like this before, Gammorah,\" \n\n\"Can you run me through what happened again?\" he asked, barely concealing his amusement behind a chuckle.\n\n\"They were in a mock torment class. Raem had just been secured in the fake shackles, and I was about to demonstrate the flaying method of torture. Before I could even begin, Raem screamed, 'Muh freedamns!' and broke free from the mock bindings. He then went on a rampage, devouring everything in sight, breathing heavily behind others as they walked, and was finally subdued only after we found him staring at a clock and asking, 'What bong it is?' \n\nI have no idea how we're going to resolve this issue, but it's turning everything we stand for into a laughingstock.\"",
    "Winter feels never-ending these days, and humanity's future looks bleak. The devastating news just hit: the last known oil reserve has been exhausted. Years ago, a massive volcanic eruption blanketed the Earth in thick, dark clouds, blocking out the sun and bringing perpetual snowfall even to the equator. We've relied on oil as our primary energy source more than ever to heat indoor farms and grow food, but even that has failed to prevent widespread famine and death from the cold. \n\nWith hydro-power halted as water turned to ice, solar power useless without sunlight, and wind turbines shattered in the freezing cold, we're left with only geothermal and nuclear energy, which simply aren’t enough. \n\nThis relentless winter has pushed us to the brink. Our only chance for survival lies in seizing control of the last functional energy generator. But doing so means battling desperately, and there’s a real chance we won't make it. I need to stop this fight, or none of us might be left to see the end of this perpetual winter.",
    "Your amnesia is worsening. Why can't I remember anything? What did I do yesterday? Was anything important? Probably not. The days all blur together. Same routine, day after day. But today feels different. I can't even remember if I did any writing, my favorite part of the day. I go to my journal. The last entry was four years ago. Impossible. I wrote after being with Sandy, watching her breathe slowly. There's a poem here. Sandy will know. She always knows.\n\nI leave the room and call out for her. \"Philip? I just checked on something,\" a voice answers. An older woman in scrubs appears. Why is a nurse in my house? I ask her where Sandy is.\n\n\"Philip, I think it would be best if you went back to bed,\" she says. I rush back to the room. Where's Sandy? I hide in the closet, leaving the door slightly open. The nurse walks in and spots me.\n\n\"Philip, come out. Let me read the last entry in the journal you're holding,\" she says. Maybe it will tell me where Sandy is. I hand her the journal and sit on the bed. She opens it effortlessly and reads:\n\n\"Philip Terrance, you're losing your memory. You've already started to forget what day it is. Soon you'll forget who people are, who you are. Maybe you'll forget language and revert to a speechless child. Then you won't remember how to read this, and someone will read it to you. But I love you.\" The nurse closes the book. I don't understand. She smiles and puts her hand on mine.\n\n\"I wrote that many years ago when you started developing amnesia,\" she says. But that's my journal.\n\n\"This isn't your journal. It's mine. You never wrote, but admired me for keeping one.\" I remember writing, don't I? She holds my hand tighter.\n\n\"You don't remember specifics, just a general feeling. You're remembering wrong. I'm your wife, Sandy, and you're Philip. We've been married for 30 years. You have amnesia.\" It must be hard for her to say this.\n\nThen, a stranger is holding my hand. She's holding a book and smiling at me. Where's Sandy?",
    "Improving Your Subtext Skills\n\nThe tech's camera flash highlighted the condensation pooling around the glass. A uniform bumped the table, causing the amber liquid to sway. The tech waited for it to settle, then moved and took another shot. Unsatisfied with the lens flare from the moist glass, he checked the LCD screen and deleted the image. Moving closer, he noticed a smudge of lipstick and a clear fingerprint on the glass. He took another photo and proceeded to the living room.",
    "The mega office buildings of the future have become colossal labyrinths, now harboring nomadic tribes who roam from office wing to office wing, subsisting on leftover doughnuts, birthday cakes, and pizza party remains. \"Make for the Hard Drive Fields, and don't stop for anything. I'm older and slower, so just get your butt there and hide. I'll catch up as soon as I can,\" Avi whispers urgently to his grandson.\n\nSuddenly, at six o'clock, a wave of darkness and silence sweeps through the halls like a shroud of death as the fluorescent lights extinguish all at once. Avi's young grandson, Karl, hadn't yet completed his first year here. He had never experienced the post-Christmas party chaos. Young Karl didn't know that his grandfather had stashed food throughout the freezing cooling tanks in the underground fields. He hadn't faced hunger's gnawing desperation.\n\nThe wave of darkness envelops them, and Karl could swear he feels it brush against his skin. That sensation quickly fades as a heavier rumbling reverberates in his chest—the frantic stampede of survival-driven feet. Peering through the Xerxes Toner Printer door—their makeshift home—Karl sees a swarm of hall dwellers charging down B-Street.\n\n\"Go, Karl! Now! Run as fast as you can! Grab all you can! I'll do my best to hold them off!\" Avi roars over the tumult.\n\nKarl sprints down the hall, tote bags bouncing wildly on their oversized leather straps, ready to be stuffed with party scraps. His thick rubber shoes squeak on the linoleum tiles, reminiscent of his year at a real school where he played kickball with kids his age. He wouldn't realize how much he cherished those moments until they were gone. Now he's here, racing up the corporate ladder in search of crumbs.\n\nAt the end of the hall, Karl glances back to see his grandfather standing defiantly, arms spread wide. Someone crashes into Avi's left shoulder at full speed, dislocating it instantly. Even amidst the chaos, Karl hears his grandfather's anguished screams as he's battered like a rag doll, slowing down only a handful of the fifteen frenzied nomads—too few to make a difference. Karl turns and pushes open the door.\n\nIn that moment, he realizes his journey ahead will be fraught with trials and tribulations, but he also understands the sheer importance of survival.\n\n\"Here we go...\"",
    "The latest and most detailed images from Pluto have just come in, revealing a staggering sight: the frozen remains of an ancient civilization. It turns out the planet was flung into its current orbit due to a cataclysmic space war. Now, humanity is scrambling to avoid a similar fate here on Earth.\n\nI never imagined I'd be dealing with something like this. As if being President wasn’t challenging enough. \"They’ve taken it way too far this time,\" I thought, shaking my head in disbelief. I immediately called my secretary to arrange a meeting with the New Horizons team.\n\n\"Forget their AMA! Cancel it and get them into my office right now. This is an order!\" I barked through the phone.\n\nThe New Horizons team arrived within an hour—naturally, a private jet was provided. Sure, it might stir up skeptics and conspiracy theories in the media, but who cares? This mess needed sorting out.\n\nWe assembled in the meeting hall. Silence hung heavy in the air.\n\n“What is this? Do you have any explanation for this? Do you think this government can cover up things like this every single time?\" I demanded, breaking the silence.\n\n“Sir, we’re sorry. It was just a hoax to gain more attention and funds. We are trying…”\n\n\"A hoax? For God's sake, do you realize what you’ve done? People are terrified. They want answers from me. The whole world is waiting for my statement.”\n\n“But sir, if we can keep this going a little longer, we could become the central power of the world. Our economy would be unstoppable.”\n\n\"No! Absolutely not. I can’t lie anymore. Elon Musk will find out the truth eventually. We need to…”\n\n“Sir, we have an insider lined up as a contract killer for him. The same guy who sabotaged the Falcon 9 - CRS7 mission…”\n\n“Listen to me, you prick! First, never, *ever* cut me off again. Second, I’m done with this fake admiration. The world deserves the truth.”\n\n“But sir…”\n\n“No! You know, I was just 11 when we reached the moon for the first time. That was my reality, until I became President and found out it was all a lie.”\n\nSilence.\n\n“And for what? Just to win a bloody space race! We can’t play with people’s emotions anymore,” I said, signaling my secretary. \n\n“Call the media. We have a lot of explaining to do.”",
    "Use a game of Civilization (like Civ 5 or Civ 4) to inspire a story. Here's an example drawn from my Civ 4 experiences (my PC can't handle Civ 5):\n\n\"Sire?\" Emperor Wang Kon raised his head, focusing on his aged, stocky adviser. Had he dozed off again? Four hours of sleep weren't enough anymore. This wasn't good.\n\n\"We've just received word from Cuzco, the Incas—they...\"\n\n\"They declared war.\" Wang had suspected Huayna Capac's boasts and threats were more than just bluster.\n\n\"Yes, they are mobilizing their forces toward the northern provinces.\"\n\n\"How many troops do we have stationed in Pyongyang and Wonsan?\"\n\n\"Three battalions each, Your Grace.\"\n\nThey would hold for a while, Wang Kon reckoned. Unfortunately, the main Korean force was still tied up in skirmishes across Mongolia. Kublai Khan's troops were under-equipped and used outdated weaponry, but they were numerous, and Khan didn't hesitate to throw waves of them at Korean riflemen.\n\nWang Kon stood, his joints cracking. He felt old. \"The Mongolians have resorted to a war of attrition. Send a letter to Kublai—he is cruel and shallow, but not foolish. We'll offer peace, and he will accept it.\" Of course, this would deplete their treasuries for reparations.\n\nAs he strode across the grand imperial hall, his adviser kept pace, carrying notes, maps, and letters in his stubby hands. \"Sire, there's more news. The Indians have sworn fealty to the Inca Empire.\"\n\n\"Of course they have,\" Wang Kon murmured, quickening his pace. \"Gandhi is always scheming. The Indians have soldiers, tanks, bombers, and missiles that would rain on our cities if I fail.\"\n\n\"See if you can get word from the Mayans and Greeks. They have no love for the Incas, and I doubt they will forsake trade relations with us, no matter how imposing Huayna's legions appear.\"\n\n\"Yes, Your Grace.\" The adviser bowed and departed.\n\nWang Kon gazed at the magnificent tapestries adorning the palace walls. They told tales of ancient glory, conquest, and the great victory over the Egyptians. He felt small, insignificant, and fearful.",
    "Congratulations! You have won an exclusive tour of the DuPont manufacturing facility. This opportunity is as captivating as a visit to Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory. I have friends working at DuPont, a leading company in plastics and chemical manufacturing, who often discuss advanced topics such as control systems and stress-strain curves. This experience promises to be both enlightening and enjoyable.\n\nUpon disembarking from the bus with five other individuals, all roughly my age, I noticed that they each held a flexible, durable sheet similar to carbon fiber. There was a palpable atmosphere of friendliness and eagerness, likely stemming from their desire to both network and assess their peers. Their conversations were filled with technical jargon on subjects such as non-Newtonian behaviors, models, control systems, and algorithms, leaving me somewhat out of my depth, as I am merely a paint technician with years of experience watching paint dry.\n\nAs we stepped off the bus, the company’s main doors swung open to reveal a flamboyantly dressed man in shimmering attire. \"Greetings and salutations!\" he announced with enthusiasm. \"Welcome to DuPont's main manufacturing headquarters! I am Doug D.D. Dupont! We hope you enjoy our tour, and please, hold your questions until the end.\" Our group, visibly keen to display their understanding of the manufacturing process and impress potential future employers, followed his directions obediently.\n\nOur first stop was a modest reception area. The receptionist stood up from her computer to issue us guest passes, made from an unusual material that caught the attention of a few members of our group, while others did not seem to notice.\n\nWe were then guided past brightly lit laboratories and offices to a dimly lit corner that had evidently suffered from neglect. Tucked away in this neglected corner was a service elevator. Although it was cramped, I did not mind the close proximity to the well-dressed women among us. Our tour guide's excitement was palpable, as if he could barely contain his eagerness to reveal what awaited us beyond the first door.\n\nUpon the elevator door opening, we stepped out into the unknown.\n\nIt is late, and I must retire for the night.",
    "As an ancient dragon who’s been guarding my gold for ages, countless heroes have come and gone, each with grand speeches about how they’ll slay me—the so-called great evil. But none have succeeded. This one hero, though? He’s different. He casually tosses a coin onto my treasure, looks me right in the eye, and says, “I have a proposition for you.”\n\nBeing a dragon, greed is pretty much in my blood. While I like to think of myself as a collector, humans tend to label me a monster. They send their best warriors to destroy me and take my hoard, but none have ever bested me.\n\nThey call me the \"Dragon of Promise\" now. While my kin have been hunted nearly to extinction, I’ve managed to survive, thanks to you, *предатель* (traitor). You didn’t surprise me when you showed up—many have before—but your swagger and confidence threw me off. A being of light, boldly walking into my lair and using the old tithe to ask for an audience? That ticked me off. But dragons are patient, and I heard you out. I remember your words clearly:\n\n“We're born from light, but we bring darkness, death, and destruction. Humans are fundamentally sick. I know you despise us, so I ask you this: Grant me power, and I’ll obliterate those who killed your siblings.”\n\nPhysical death doesn’t faze me; a dragon’s spirit is immortal. I vividly recall you carrying me out of my cave into the sunlight for the first time in a millennium, in this new form. Clad in my bones, humanity would tremble before you.\n\nSo, give me your arm, my bearer. Let’s fill this world with terror together.",
    "It wasn't the Nazis hiding on the dark side of the moon—it was the Roman Empire, and they’ve returned with a vengeance.\n\n\"Preparing to breach atmosphere, Legate!\"\n\"Proceed, Captain.\"\n\nLegate Caecilius Petrus Belisarius stood tall on the bridge of his massive flagship, *Cerberus*. His brilliant red cape, fastened by gold sunbursts, almost touched the floor. A ridged helmet with equally brilliant red horse hair crowned his head, and his specially commissioned breastplate bore an intricate engraving of a charging bull, its hooves churning stylized waves. His burnished bronze boots and greaves reflected the blinking console lights.\n\nFrom his high platform at the rear of the bridge, he overlooked his men in practical black uniforms working diligently at their consoles. The blue Earth filled the enormous window ahead of them.\n\nThe engines roared to life, shaking the ship momentarily before the inertial dampeners engaged. Earth drifted downward in the window, replaced by the blackness of space and quickly by a red, fiery glow as the ship prepared for atmospheric entry.\n\nThis was the critical moment. The *Cerberus*, an enormous vessel over a kilometer long and two stadia wide at its broadest, faced the ultimate test. Failure of the heat shields or structural stability meant certain death, but Belisarius trusted in Roman engineering. If disaster struck, it would be over in less than a quarter second.\n\nYet the *Cerberus* held firm, a testament to Roman ingenuity. The ship glowed like a bright red coal as it seared through the sky. Moments later, three more \"coals\" appeared, then a dozen, then a hundred, as *Legio X Fretensis* initiated their invasion.\n\nThe die was cast.",
    "Hell has finally shut down for good, and everyone was moved to a brand-new place—New Hell. Except, I totally overslept and missed the moving day. Now, I'm stuck in the abandoned Old Hell, which is getting colder by the minute. Surprisingly, Hell wasn't that bad for me; I guess I have a high tolerance for pain. The demons didn't really scare me, and the punishments were manageable. But the best part was having company around. I had major issues with loneliness when I was alive, and it led me to do some pretty awful things.\n\nBack in my teenage years, I did something really dumb. A guy locked me in a cold, dark locker, and I snapped. Adding cyanide to the party mix seemed like a twisted way to get even. Everyone thought the guy was in the right, so I felt isolated. If I had to be alone, then so did everyone else. I even drank the mix to avoid trouble, and that’s how we all ended up in Hell.\n\nThere was Cindy and Mindy, the twins who never missed a chance to insult me; Derek, the jerk who locked me in the locker; and Sarah, the girl I secretly liked who was dating Derek. They all freaked out when they realized they were stuck in Hell because of my actions. But after 40 years of being here, we made peace with each other. We actually became friends, despite the constant torment around us. For the first time ever, I was genuinely happy. It was ironic, but Hell felt like home.\n\nSo when the move to New Hell came, we were all excited. We laughed and joked while waiting in line, probably annoying everyone else. Sarah went through first, then Derek, then Cindy and Mindy. But just as it was my turn, the head demon yanked me back and went through the portal himself, leaving me behind.\n\nNow, I'm alone again. It's so cold and dark, and the loneliness is creeping back in.",
    "Every person could change the past exactly once, but altering too much turned those affected into the mental equivalent of vegetables. Survivor bias. The new power brought both excitement and fear, with pundits and preachers predicting chaos. \n\nHowever, the consequences of changing the past were self-limiting. Drastic changes led to disasters, while minor tweaks went unnoticed. The wreckage of failed attempts was evident everywhere; successful changes left no mark. Feedback came only from visible effects—mostly when things went wrong. Confirmed time travel incidents had become rare over the years. Survivor bias.\n\nPublic Service Announcements (PSAs) still aired constantly. Everyone knew the risks. Few, if any, dared to use the power anymore, and some doubted if it even existed.\n\nSamantha had spent ten years in this senior center, enduring the half-smiles of orderlies and visits from school choirs twice a year. She was always sore, especially when the heat was turned down. At 1AM, she found the chairs too hard but the bed too far.\n\nFocused on the TV, she watched a PSA turn to infomercials. Samantha frowned, then closed her eyes, bit her lip, and stepped through time.\n\nBright light filled the garage; Paul was in the passenger seat, clutching his chest. He would lose consciousness soon. \n\nFor the last time, again, Samantha looked at her husband and chose to smile. She held Paul's hand tight; he managed to smile back.\n\nClosing her eyes, Samantha turned the key, pressed the remote to shut the garage door, and asked the universe for a small favor.\n\n\"Please, let us be just small enough.\"",
    "God has been barred from entering Heaven. Let me explain the events that led up to and resulted from this:\n\n*I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End.*\n\nI've never really liked how they've portrayed me—too sanctimonious, to put it mildly. They got so much of it wrong. It was filled with misplaced animosity, too ambiguous, and left to be deciphered by fallible bishops. But that one line… I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End. They knew from the outset that it all culminates with me.\n\n*Even now, they believe they can expel me from my own domain. They could never comprehend what it feels like. Investing everything in humanity only to witness a ravaged planet—stripped to its bare bones, a desolate land of hatred and sin.*\n\nMaybe I did go too far this time. I vowed never to obliterate their fragile lives in a fit of wrathful vengeance again. In this falsehood, I became as human as anyone else. Souls await at my door, and judgment is impossible without me.\n\nThey could never fathom the burden I carry, the overwhelming guilt for every life, every death. I had eons to plan this ill-fated endeavor, countless blunders to date, each ending the same. Time will eventually run out, as I see, though there will be countless attempts before it's all finished. How I yearn for the end... the repetition is maddening."
