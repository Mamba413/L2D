    "Process calculi based on logic, such as $\\pi$DILL and CP, provide a foundation for deadlock-free concurrent programming. However, in previous work, there is a mismatch between the rules for constructing proofs and the term constructors of the $\\pi$-calculus: the fundamental operator for parallel composition does not correspond to any rule of linear logic. Kokke et al. (2019) introduced Hypersequent Classical Processes (HCP), which addresses this mismatch using hypersequents (collections of sequents) to register parallelism in the typing judgements. However, the step from CP to HCP is a big one. As of yet, HCP does not have reduction semantics, and the addition of delayed actions means that CP processes interpreted as HCP processes do not behave as they would in CP. We introduce HCP-, a variant of HCP with reduction semantics and without delayed actions. We prove progress, preservation, and termination, and show that HCP- supports the same communication protocols as CP.",
    "A simple variant of the BDDC preconditioner in which constraints are imposed on a selected set of subobjects (subdomain subedges, subfaces and vertices between pairs of subedges) is presented. We are able to show that the condition number of the preconditioner is bounded by $C \\big(1+\\log (L/h)\\big)^2$, where $C$ is a constant, and $h$ and $L$ are the characteristic sizes of the mesh and the subobjects, respectively. As $L$ can be chosen almost freely, the condition number can theoretically be as small as $O(1)$. We will discuss the pros and cons of the preconditioner and its application to heterogeneous problems. Numerical results on supercomputers are provided.",
    "We give examples of where the Heun function exists as solutions of wave equations encountered in general relativity. While the Dirac equation written in the background of Nutku helicoid metric yields Mathieu functions as its solutions in four spacetime dimensions, the trivial generalization to five dimensions results in the double confluent Heun function. We reduce this solution to the Mathieu function with some transformations. We must apply Atiyah-Patodi-Singer spectral boundary conditions to this system since the metric has a singularity at the origin.",
    "As it was shown by many authors, a slow decrease in X-rays observed during the decay phase of long duration flares (LDE) can be explained only by a magnetic reconnection and energy release ceaselessly ongoing in the coronal part of a flare. Using RHESSI data we try to answer two following questions. How effective are these processes at the LDEs decay phase and how can precisely the energy release rate be calculated based on these data? To answer the questions images of the selected LDEs during their decay phase were reconstructed. Physical parameters of flare coronal sources obtained from image spectral analysis allowed us to study the efficiency of the energy release process. We also examined terms included in the energy equation to find out what is the accuracy of determination of each term.",
    "By means of a multi-scale analysis we describe the typical geometrical structure of the clusters under the FK measure in random media. Our result holds in any dimension greater or equal to 2 provided that slab percolation occurs under the averaged measure, which should be the case in the whole supercritical phase. This work extends the one of Pisztora and provides an essential tool for the analysis of the supercritical regime in disordered FK models and in the corresponding disordered Ising and Potts models.",
    "Photospheric absorption lines in classical T Tauri stars (CTTS) are weak compared to normal stars. This so-called veiling is normally identified with an excess continuous emission formed in shock-heated gas at the stellar surface below the accretion streams. We have selected four stars (RW Aur A, RU Lup, S CrA NW and S CrA SE) with unusually strong veiling to make a detailed investigation of veiling versus stellar brightness and emission line strengths for comparisons to standard accretion models. We have monitored the stars photometrically and spectroscopically at several epochs. In standard accretion models a variable accretion rate will lead to a variable excess emission. Consequently, the stellar brightness should vary accordingly. We find that the veiling of absorption lines in these stars is strongly variable and usually so large that it would require the release of several stellar luminosities of potential energy. At states of very large line dilution, the correspondingly large veiling factors derived correlate only weakly with brightness. Moreover, the emission line strengths violate the expected trend of veiling versus line strength. The veiling can change dramatically in one night, and is not correlated with the phase of the rotation periods found for two stars. We show that in at least three of the stars, when the veiling becomes high, the photospheric lines become filled-in by line emission, which produces large veiling factors unrelated to changes in any continuous emission from shocked regions. We also consider to what extent extinction by dust and electron scattering in the accretion stream may affect veiling measures in CTTS. We conclude that the degree of veiling cannot be used as a measure of accretion rates in CTTS with rich emission line spectra.",
    "Giant low surface brightness (GLSB) galaxies are commonly thought to be massive, dark matter dominated systems. However, this conclusion is based on highly uncertain rotation curves. We present here a new study of two prototypical GLSB galaxies: Malin 1 and NGC 7589. We re-analysed existing HI observations and derived new rotation curves, which were used to investigate the distributions of luminous and dark matter in these galaxies. In contrast to previous findings, the rotation curves of both galaxies show a steep rise in the central parts, typical of high surface brightness (HSB) systems. Mass decompositions with a dark matter halo show that baryons may dominate the dynamics of the inner regions. Indeed, a \"maximum disk\" fit gives stellar mass-to-light ratios in the range of values typically found for HSB galaxies. These results, together with other recent studies, suggest that GLSB galaxies are systems with a double structure: an inner HSB early-type spiral galaxy and an outer extended LSB disk. We also tested the predictions of MOND: the rotation curve of NGC 7589 is reproduced well, whereas Malin 1 represents a challenging test for the theory.",
    "The multiplicity distribution, multiplicity moment, scaled variance, entropy and reduced entropy of target evaporated fragment emitted in forward and backward hemispheres in 12 A GeV $^{4}$He, 3.7 A GeV $^{16}$O, 60 A GeV $^{16}$O, 1.7 A GeV $^{84}$Kr and 10.7 A GeV $^{197}$Au induced emulsion heavy targets (AgBr) interactions are investigated. It is found that the multiplicity distribution of target evaporated fragments emitted in forward and backward hemispheres can be fitted by a Gaussian distribution. The multiplicity moments of target evaporated particles emitted in forward and backward hemispheres increase with the order of the moment {\\em q}, and second-order multiplicity moment is energy independent over the entire energy for all the interactions in the forward and backward hemisphere respectively. The scaled variance, a direct measure of multiplicity fluctuations, is close to one for all the interactions which may be said that there is a feeble correlation among the produced particles. The entropy of target evaporated fragments emitted in forward and backward hemispheres are the same within experimental errors, respectively.",
    "We investigate theoretically the temporal behavior of a quantum dot under off-resonant optical excitation targeted at fast acoustic phonon-assisted state preparation. We demonstrate that in a preparation process driven by short laser pulses three processes can be identified: a dressing of the states during the switch on of the laser pulse, a subsequent phonon-induced relaxation and an undressing at the end of the pulse. By analyzing excitation scenarios with different pulse shapes we highlight the decisive impact of an adiabatic undressing on the final state in short pulse protocols. Furthermore, we show that in exciton-biexciton systems the laser characteristics such as the pulse detuning and the pulse length as well as the biexciton binding energy can be used to select the targeted quantum dot state.",
    "In the quantum mechanical Hilbert space formalism, the probabilistic interpretation is a later ad-hoc add-on, more or less enforced by the experimental evidence, but not motivated by the mathematical model itself. A model involving a clear probabilistic interpretation from the very beginning is provided by the quantum logics with unique conditional probabilities. It includes the projection lattices in von Neumann algebras and here probability conditionalization becomes identical with the state transition of the Lueders - von Neumann measurement process. This motivates the definition of a hierarchy of five compatibility and comeasurability levels in the abstract setting of the quantum logics with unique conditional probabilities. Their meanings are: the absence of quantum interference or influence, the existence of a joint distribution, simultaneous measurability, and the independence of the final state after two successive measurements from the sequential order of these two measurements. A further level means that two elements of the quantum logic (events) belong to the same Boolean subalgebra. In the general case, the five compatibility and comeasurability levels appear to differ, but they all coincide in the common Hilbert space formalism of quantum mechanics, in von Neumann algebras, and in some other cases.",
    "An analysis is presented of wave-vector dispersion in elliptically birefringent stratified magneto-optic media having one-dimensional periodicity. It is found that local normal-mode polarization-state differences between adjacent layers lead to mode coupling and impact the wave-vector dispersion and the character of the Bloch states of the system. This coupling produces extra terms in the dispersion relation not present in uniform circularly birefringent magneto-optic stratified media. Normal mode coupling lifts the degeneracy at frequency band cross-over points under certain conditions and induces a magnetization-dependent optical band gap. This study examines the conditions for band gap formation in the system. It shows that such a frequency-split can be characterized by a simple coupling parameter that depends on the relation between polarization states of local normal modes in adjacent layers. The character of the Bloch states and conditions for maximizing the strength of the band splitting in these systems are analyzed.",
    "We study a natural extension of classical empirical risk minimization, where the hypothesis space is a random subspace of a given space. In particular, we consider possibly data dependent subspaces spanned by a random subset of the data, recovering as a special case Nystr\\\"om approaches for kernel methods. Considering random subspaces naturally leads to computational savings, but the question is whether the corresponding learning accuracy is degraded. These statistical-computational tradeoffs have been recently explored for the least squares loss and self-concordant loss functions, such as the logistic loss. Here, we work to extend these results to convex Lipschitz loss functions, that might not be smooth, such as the hinge loss used in support vector machines. This extension requires developing new proofs, that use different technical tools. Our main results show the existence of different settings, depending on how hard the learning problem is, for which computational efficiency can be improved with no loss in performance. Theoretical results are illustrated with simple numerical experiments.",
    "The notion of patient's consent plays a major role in granting access to medical data. In typical healthcare systems, consent is captured by a form that the patient has to fill in and sign. In e-Health systems, the paper-form consent is being replaced by the integration of the notion of consent in the mechanisms that regulate the access to the medical data. This helps in empowering the patient with the capability of granting and revoking consent in a more effective manner. However, the process of granting and revoking consent greatly varies according to the situation in which the patient is. Our main argument is that such a level of detail is very difficult and error-prone to capture as a set of authorisation policies. In this paper, we present ACTORS, a goal-driven approach to manage consent. The main idea behind ACTORS is to leverage the goal-driven approach of Teleo-Reactive (TR) programming for managing consent that takes into account changes regarding the domains and contexts in which the patient is providing her consent.",
    "This paper is concerned with the mathematical analysis of the inverse random source problem for the time fractional diffusion equation, where the source is assumed to be driven by a fractional Brownian motion. Given the random source, the direct problem is to study the stochastic time fractional diffusion equation. The inverse problem is to determine the statistical properties of the source from the expectation and variance of the final time data. For the direct problem, we show that it is well-posed and has a unique mild solution under a certain condition. For the inverse problem, the uniqueness is proved and the instability is characterized. The major ingredients of the analysis are based on the properties of the Mittag--Leffler function and the stochastic integrals associated with the fractional Brownian motion.",
    "Manifold learning methods play a prominent role in nonlinear dimensionality reduction and other tasks involving high-dimensional data sets with low intrinsic dimensionality. Many of these methods are graph-based: they associate a vertex with each data point and a weighted edge with each pair. Existing theory shows that the Laplacian matrix of the graph converges to the Laplace-Beltrami operator of the data manifold, under the assumption that the pairwise affinities are based on the Euclidean norm. In this paper, we determine the limiting differential operator for graph Laplacians constructed using $\\textit{any}$ norm. Our proof involves an interplay between the second fundamental form of the manifold and the convex geometry of the given norm's unit ball. To demonstrate the potential benefits of non-Euclidean norms in manifold learning, we consider the task of mapping the motion of large molecules with continuous variability. In a numerical simulation we show that a modified Laplacian eigenmaps algorithm, based on the Earthmover's distance, outperforms the classic Euclidean Laplacian eigenmaps, both in terms of computational cost and the sample size needed to recover the intrinsic geometry.",
    "We present an efficient integral equation approach to solve the heat equation, $u_t (\\x) - \\Delta u(\\x) = F(\\x,t)$, in a two-dimensional, multiply connected domain, and with Dirichlet boundary conditions. Instead of using integral equations based on the heat kernel, we take the approach of discretizing in time, first. This leads to a non-homogeneous modified Helmholtz equation that is solved at each time step. The solution to this equation is formulated as a volume potential plus a double layer potential.The volume potential is evaluated using a fast multipole-accelerated solver. The boundary conditions are then satisfied by solving an integral equation for the homogeneous modified Helmholtz equation. The integral equation solver is also accelerated by the fast multipole method (FMM). For a total of $N$ points in the discretization of the boundary and the domain, the total computational cost per time step is $O(N)$ or $O(N\\log N)$.",
    "We discuss a scheme in which sequential state-discrimination measurements are performed on qudits to determine the quantum state in which they were initially prepared. The qudits belong to a set of nonorthogonal quantum states and hence cannot be distinguished with certainty. Unambiguous state discrimination allows error-free measurements at the expense of occasionally failing to give a conclusive answer about the state of the qudit. Qudits have the potential to carry more information per transmission than qubits. We considered the situation in which Alice sends one of N qudits, where the dimension of the qudits is also N. We look at two cases, one in which the states all have the same overlap and one in which the qudits are divided into two sets, with qudits in different sets having different overlaps. We also study the robustness of our scheme against a simple eavesdropping attack and found that by using qudits rather than qubits, there is a greater probability that an eavesdropper will introduce errors and be detected.",
    "This work aims to provide a more secure access control in Hyperledger Fabric blockchain by combining multiple ID's, attributes, and policies with the components that regulate access control. The access control system currently used by Hyperledger Fabric is first completely analyzed. Next, a new implementation is proposed that builds upon the existing solution but provides users and developers with easier ways to make access control decisions based on combinations of multiple ID's, attributes, and policies. Our proposed implementation encapsulates the Fabric CA client to facilitate attribute addition and simplify the process of registering and enrolling a newly created certificate (corresponding to a new user). This research, concludes that it is possible to combine multiple ID's, attributes, and policies with the help of Hyperledger Fabric's smart contract technology. Furthermore, it could be seen that the performance impact for real-world applications is negligible compared to the insecure case of always providing access to a resource without performing access control.",
    "This work introduces pyramidal convolution (PyConv), which is capable of processing the input at multiple filter scales. PyConv contains a pyramid of kernels, where each level involves different types of filters with varying size and depth, which are able to capture different levels of details in the scene. On top of these improved recognition capabilities, PyConv is also efficient and, with our formulation, it does not increase the computational cost and parameters compared to standard convolution. Moreover, it is very flexible and extensible, providing a large space of potential network architectures for different applications. PyConv has the potential to impact nearly every computer vision task and, in this work, we present different architectures based on PyConv for four main tasks on visual recognition: image classification, video action classification/recognition, object detection and semantic image segmentation/parsing. Our approach shows significant improvements over all these core tasks in comparison with the baselines. For instance, on image recognition, our 50-layers network outperforms in terms of recognition performance on ImageNet dataset its counterpart baseline ResNet with 152 layers, while having 2.39 times less parameters, 2.52 times lower computational complexity and more than 3 times less layers. On image segmentation, our novel framework sets a new state-of-the-art on the challenging ADE20K benchmark for scene parsing. Code is available at: https://github.com/iduta/pyconv",
    "The status of the solar axion search with the CERN Axion Solar Telescope (CAST) will be discussed. Results from the first part of CAST phase II where the magnet bores were filled with 4He gas at variable pressure in order to scan axion masses up to 0.4 eV will be presented. From the absence of excess X-rays when the magnet was pointing to the Sun, we set a typical upper limit on the axion-photon coupling of g < 2.17 x 10^10 GeV$-1 at 95% CL for axion masses lower than 0.4 eV, the exact result depending on the pressure setting. Our search for axions with masses up to about 1.2 eV using 3He as a buffer gas is in progress in the second part of CAST phase II. Expectations for sensibilities will be given. Near future perspectives as well as more long term options for a new helioscope experiment will be evoked.",
    "Observations indicate that the Arctic sea ice cover is rapidly retreating while the Antarctic sea ice cover is steadily expanding. State-of-the-art climate models, by contrast, typically simulate a moderate decrease in both the Arctic and Antarctic sea ice covers. However, in each hemisphere there is a small subset of model simulations that have sea ice trends similar to the observations. Based on this, a number of recent studies have suggested that the models are consistent with the observations in each hemisphere when simulated internal climate variability is taken into account. Here we examine sea ice changes during 1979-2013 in simulations from the most recent Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) as well as the Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble (CESM-LE), drawing on previous work that found a close relationship in climate models between global-mean surface temperature and sea ice extent. We find that all of the simulations with 1979-2013 Arctic sea ice retreat as fast as observed have considerably more global warming than observations during this time period. Using two separate methods to estimate the sea ice retreat that would occur under the observed level of global warming in each simulation in both ensembles, we find that simulated Arctic sea ice retreat as fast as observed would occur less than 1% of the time. This implies that the models are not consistent with the observations. In the Antarctic, we find that simulated sea ice expansion as fast as observed typically corresponds with too little global warming, although these results are more equivocal. We show that because of this, the simulations do not capture the observed asymmetry between Arctic and Antarctic sea ice trends. This suggests that the models may be getting the right sea ice trends for the wrong reasons in both polar regions.",
    "Bio-features are fast becoming a key tool to authenticate the IoT devices; in this sense, the purpose of this investigation is to summaries the factors that hinder biometrics models' development and deployment on a large scale, including human physiological (e.g., face, eyes, fingerprints-palm, or electrocardiogram) and behavioral features (e.g., signature, voice, gait, or keystroke). The different machine learning and data mining methods used by authentication and authorization schemes for mobile IoT devices are provided. Threat models and countermeasures used by biometrics-based authentication schemes for mobile IoT devices are also presented. More specifically, We analyze the state of the art of the existing biometric-based authentication schemes for IoT devices. Based on the current taxonomy, We conclude our paper with different types of challenges for future research efforts in biometrics-based authentication schemes for IoT devices.",
    "Device fingerprinting over the web has received much attention both by the research community and the commercial market a like. Almost all the fingerprinting features proposed to date depend on software run on the device. All of these features can be changed by the user, thereby thwarting the device's fingerprint. In this position paper we argue that the recent emergence of the HTML5 standard gives rise to a new class of fingerprinting features that are based on the \\emph{hardware} of the device. Such features are much harder to mask or change thus provide a higher degree of confidence in the fingerprint. We propose several possible fingerprint methods that allow a HTML5 web application to identify a device's hardware. We also present an initial experiment to fingerprint a device's GPU.",
    "We present the partition function of Chern-Simons theory with the exceptional gauge group on three-sphere in the form of a partition function of the refined closed topological string with relation $2\\tau=g_s(1-b) $ between single K\\\"ahler parameter $\\tau$, string coupling constant $g_s$ and refinement parameter $b$, where $b=\\frac{5}{3},\\frac{5}{2},3,4,6$ for $G_2, F_4, E_6, E_7, E_8$, respectively. The non-zero BPS invariants $N^d_{J_L,J_R}$ ($d$ - degree) are $N^2_{0,\\frac{1}{2}}=1, N^{11}_{0,1}=1$. Besides these terms, partition function of Chern-Simons theory contains term corresponding to the refined constant maps of string theory. Derivation is based on the universal (in Vogel's sense) form of a Chern-Simons partition function on three-sphere, restricted to exceptional line $Exc$ with Vogel's parameters satisfying $\\gamma=2(\\alpha+\\beta)$. This line contains points, corresponding to the all exceptional groups. The same results are obtained for $F$ line $\\gamma=\\alpha+\\beta$ (containing $SU(4), SO(10)$ and $E_6$ groups), with the non-zero $N^2_{0,\\frac{1}{2}}=1, N^{7}_{0,1}=1$. In both cases refinement parameter $b$ ($=-\\epsilon_2/\\epsilon_1$ in terms of Nekrasov's parameters) is given in terms of universal parameters, restricted to the line, by $b=-\\beta/\\alpha$.",
    "The centerpoint theorem is a well-known and widely used result in discrete geometry. It states that for any point set $P$ of $n$ points in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, there is a point $c$, not necessarily from $P$, such that each halfspace containing $c$ contains at least $\\frac{n}{d+1}$ points of $P$. Such a point $c$ is called a centerpoint, and it can be viewed as a generalization of a median to higher dimensions. In other words, a centerpoint can be interpreted as a good representative for the point set $P$. But what if we allow more than one representative? For example in one-dimensional data sets, often certain quantiles are chosen as representatives instead of the median. We present a possible extension of the concept of quantiles to higher dimensions. The idea is to find a set $Q$ of (few) points such that every halfspace that contains one point of $Q$ contains a large fraction of the points of $P$ and every halfspace that contains more of $Q$ contains an even larger fraction of $P$. This setting is comparable to the well-studied concepts of weak $\\varepsilon$-nets and weak $\\varepsilon$-approximations, where it is stronger than the former but weaker than the latter.",
    "We have produced a new software package for the simulation of pulsar populations, \\textsc{PsrPopPy}, based on the \\textsc{Psrpop} package. The codebase has been re-written in Python (save for some external libraries, which remain in their native Fortran), utilising the object-oriented features of the language, and improving the modularity of the code. Pre-written scripts are provided for running the simulations in `standard' modes of operation, but the code is flexible enough to support the writing of personalised scripts. The modular structure also makes the addition of experimental features (such as new models for period or luminosity distributions) more straightforward than with the previous code. We also discuss potential additions to the modelling capabilities of the software. Finally, we demonstrate some potential applications of the code; first, using results of surveys at different observing frequencies, we find pulsar spectral indices are best fit by a normal distribution with mean $-1.4$ and standard deviation $1.0$. Second, we model pulsar spin evolution to calculate the best-fit for a relationship between a pulsar's luminosity and spin parameters. We used the code to replicate the analysis of Faucher-Gigu\\`ere & Kaspi, and have subsequently optimized their power-law dependence of radio luminosity, $L$, with period, $P$, and period derivative, $\\dot{P}$. We find that the underlying population is best described by $L \\propto P^{-1.39 \\pm 0.09} \\dot{P}^{0.48 \\pm 0.04}$ and is very similar to that found for $\\gamma$-ray pulsars by Perera et al. Using this relationship, we generate a model population and examine the age-luminosity relation for the entire pulsar population, which may be measurable after future large-scale surveys with the Square Kilometer Array.",
    "We study the dynamics of a spin ensemble strongly coupled to a single-mode resonator driven by external pulses. When the mean frequency of the spin ensemble is in resonance with the cavity mode, damped Rabi oscillations are found between the spin ensemble and the cavity mode which we describe very accurately, including the dephasing effect of the inhomogeneous spin broadening. We demonstrate that a precise knowledge of this broadening is crucial both for a qualitative and a quantitative understanding of the temporal spin-cavity dynamics. On this basis we show that coherent oscillations between the spin ensemble and the cavity can be enhanced by a few orders of magnitude, when driving the system with pulses that match special resonance conditions. Our theoretical approach is tested successfully with an experiment based on an ensemble of negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond strongly coupled to a superconducting coplanar single-mode waveguide resonator.",
    "We investigate the ground-state Riemannian metric and the cyclic quantum distance of an inhomogeneous quantum Ising spin-1/2 chain in a transverse field. This model can be diagonalized by using a general canonical transformation to the fermionic Hamiltonian mapped from the spin system. The ground-state Riemannian metric is derived exactly on a parameter manifold ring $S^1$, which is introduced by performing a gauge transformation to the spin Hamiltonian through a twist operator. The ground-state cyclic quantum distance and the second derivative of the ground-state energy are studied in different inhomogeneous exchange coupling parameter region. Particularly, we show that the quantum ferromagnetic phase in the uniform Ising chain can be characterized by an invariant cyclic quantum distance with a constant ground-state Riemannian metric, and this metric will rapidly decay to zero in the paramagnetic phase.",
    "Rotation measure synthesis allows the estimation of Faraday dispersion via a Fourier transform and is the primary tool to probe cosmic magnetic fields. We show this can be considered mathematically equivalent to the one dimensional interferometric intensity measurement equation, albeit in a different Fourier space. As a result, familiar concepts in two dimensional intensity interferometry designed to correctly account for a range of instrumental conditions can be translated to the analysis of Faraday dispersion. In particular, we show how to model the effect of channel averaging during Faraday reconstruction, which has to date limited the progress of polarimetic science using wide-band measurements. Further, we simulate 1d sparse reconstruction with channel averaging for realistic frequency coverages, and show that it is possible to recover signals with large rotation measure values that were previously excluded from possible detection. This is especially important for low-frequency and wide-band polarimetry. We extended these ideas to introduce mosaicking in Faraday depth into the channel averaging process. This work, thus provides the first framework for correctly undertaking wide-band rotation measure synthesis, including the provision to add data from multiple telescopes, a prospect that should vastly improve the quality and quantity of polarimetric science. This is of particular importance for extreme environments which generate high magnetic fields such as those associated with pulsars and Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), and will allow such sources to be accurately used as probes of cosmological fields.",
    "Study of the characteristic properties of charged particle production in hadron-nucleus collisions at high energies, by utilising the approaches from different statistical models is performed.~Predictions from different approaches using the Negative Binomial distribution, shifted Gompertz distribution, Weibull distribution and the Krasznovszky-Wagner distribution are utilised for a comparative study of the relative successes of these models.~These distributions derived from a variety of functional forms are based on either phenomenological parameterizations or some model of the underlying dynamics.~Some of these have have also been used to study the data at the LHC for both proton-proton and nucleus-nucleus collisions.~Various physical and derived observables have been used for the analysis.",
    "In 1975 John Tukey proposed a multivariate median which is the 'deepest' point in a given data cloud in R^d. Later, in measuring the depth of an arbitrary point z with respect to the data, David Donoho and Miriam Gasko considered hyperplanes through z and determined its 'depth' by the smallest portion of data that are separated by such a hyperplane. Since then, these ideas has proved extremely fruitful. A rich statistical methodology has developed that is based on data depth and, more general, nonparametric depth statistics. General notions of data depth have been introduced as well as many special ones. These notions vary regarding their computability and robustness and their sensitivity to reflect asymmetric shapes of the data. According to their different properties they fit to particular applications. The upper level sets of a depth statistic provide a family of set-valued statistics, named depth-trimmed or central regions. They describe the distribution regarding its location, scale and shape. The most central region serves as a median. The notion of depth has been extended from data clouds, that is empirical distributions, to general probability distributions on R^d, thus allowing for laws of large numbers and consistency results. It has also been extended from d-variate data to data in functional spaces.",
    "Strain-engineering in SiGe nanostructures is fundamental for the design of optoelectronic devices at the nanoscale. Here we explore a new strategy, where SiGe structures are laterally confined by the Si substrate, to obtain high tensile strain avoiding the use of external stressors, and thus improving the scalability. Spectro-microscopy techniques, finite element method simulations and ab initio calculations are used to investigate the strain state of laterally confined Ge-rich SiGe nano-stripes. Strain information is obtained by tip enhanced Raman spectroscopy with an unprecedented lateral resolution of ~ 30 nm. The nano-stripes exhibit a large tensile hydrostatic strain component, which is maximum at the center of the top free surface, and becomes very small at the edges. The maximum lattice deformation is larger than the typical values of thermally relaxed Ge/Si(001) layers. This strain enhancement originates from a frustrated relaxation in the out-of-plane direction, resulting from the combination of the lateral confinement induced by the substrate side walls and the plastic relaxation of the misfit strain in the (001) plane at the SiGe/Si interface. The effect of this tensile lattice deformation at the stripe surface is probed by work function mapping, performed with a spatial resolution better than 100 nm using X-ray photoelectron emission microscopy. The nano-stripes exhibit a positive work function shift with respect to a bulk SiGe alloy, quantitatively confirmed by electronic structure calculations of tensile strained configurations. The present results have a potential impact on the design of optoelectronic devices at a nanometer length scale.",
    "During an infectious disease pandemic, it is critical to share electronic medical records or models (learned from these records) across regions. Applying one region's data/model to another region often have distribution shift issues that violate the assumptions of traditional machine learning techniques. Transfer learning can be a solution. To explore the potential of deep transfer learning algorithms, we applied two data-based algorithms (domain adversarial neural networks and maximum classifier discrepancy) and model-based transfer learning algorithms to infectious disease detection tasks. We further studied well-defined synthetic scenarios where the data distribution differences between two regions are known. Our experiments show that, in the context of infectious disease classification, transfer learning may be useful when (1) the source and target are similar and the target training data is insufficient and (2) the target training data does not have labels. Model-based transfer learning works well in the first situation, in which case the performance closely matched that of the data-based transfer learning models. Still, further investigation of the domain shift in real world research data to account for the drop in performance is needed.",
    "Bound states in the continuum (BIC) have been at the forefront of research in optics and photonics over the past decade. It is of great interest to study the effects associated with quasi-BICs in the simplest structures, where quasi-BICs are very pronounced. An example is a dielectric cylinder, and in a number of works, quasi-BICs have been studied both in single cylinders and in structures composed of cylinders. In this work, we studied the properties of quasi-BICs during the transition from a homogeneous dielectric cylinder in an air environment to a ring with narrow walls while increasing the diameter of the inner air cylinder gradually. The results demonstrate the quasi-BIC crossover from the strong-coupling to the weak-coupling regime, which manifests itself in the transition from avoided crossing of branches to their intersection with the quasi-BIC being preserved on only one straight branch. In the regime of strong-coupling and quasi-BIC, three waves interfere in the far-field zone: two waves corresponding to the resonant modes of the structure and the wave scattered by the structure as a whole. The validity of the Fano resonance concept is discussed, since it describes the interference of only two waves under weak coupling conditions.",
    "Turbulent thermal diffusion is a combined effect of the temperature stratified turbulence and inertia of small particles. It causes the appearance of a non-diffusive turbulent flux of particles in the direction of the turbulent heat flux. This non-diffusive turbulent flux of particles is proportional to the product of the mean particle number density and the effective velocity of inertial particles. The theory of this effect has been previously developed only for small temperature gradients and small Stokes numbers (Phys. Rev. Lett. {\\bf 76}, 224, 1996). In this study a generalized theory of turbulent thermal diffusion for arbitrary temperature gradients and Stokes numbers has been developed. The laboratory experiments in the oscillating grid turbulence and in the multi-fan produced turbulence have been performed to validate the theory of turbulent thermal diffusion in strongly stratified turbulent flows. It has been shown that the ratio of the effective velocity of inertial particles to the characteristic vertical turbulent velocity for large Reynolds numbers is less than 1. The effective velocity of inertial particles as well as the effective coefficient of turbulent thermal diffusion increase with Stokes numbers reaching the maximum at small Stokes numbers and decreases for larger Stokes numbers. The effective coefficient of turbulent thermal diffusion also decreases with the mean temperature gradient. It has been demonstrated that the developed theory is in a good agreement with the results of the laboratory experiments.",
    "A standard model for the visibility of pulsar radio emission is based on the assumption that the emission is confined to a narrow cone about the tangent to a dipolar field line. The widely accepted rotating vector model (RVM) is an approximation in which the line of sight is fixed and the field line is not strictly tangent to it. We refer to an exact treatment (Gangadhara 2004) as the tangent model. In the tangent model (but not in the RVM) the visible point changes as a function of pulsar rotational phase, $\\psi$, defining a trajectory on a sphere of radius $r$. We solve for the trajectory and for the angular velocity of the visible point around it. We note the recent claim that this motion is observable using interstellar holography (Pen et al. 2014). We estimate the error introduced by use of the RVM and find that it is significant for pulsars with emission over a wide range of $\\psi$. The RVM tends to underestimate the range of $\\psi$ over which emission is visible. We suggest that the geometry alone strongly favors the visible pulsar radio being emitted at a heights more than ten percent of the light-cylinder distance, where our neglect of retardation effects becomes significant.",
    "In image recognition, there are many cases where training samples cannot cover all target classes. Zero-shot learning (ZSL) utilizes the class semantic information to classify samples of the unseen categories that have no corresponding samples contained in the training set. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end framework, called Global Semantic Consistency Network (GSC-Net for short), which makes complete use of the semantic information of both seen and unseen classes, to support effective zero-shot learning. We also adopt a soft label embedding loss to further exploit the semantic relationships among classes. To adapt GSC-Net to a more practical setting, Generalized Zero-shot Learning (GZSL), we introduce a parametric novelty detection mechanism. Our approach achieves the state-of-the-art performance on both ZSL and GZSL tasks over three visual attribute datasets, which validates the effectiveness and advantage of the proposed framework.",
    "The popular view according to which Category theory provides a support for Mathematical Structuralism is erroneous. Category-theoretic foundations of mathematics require a different philosophy of mathematics. While structural mathematics studies invariant forms (Awodey) categorical mathematics studies covariant transformations which, generally, don t have any invariants. In this paper I develop a non-structuralist interpretation of categorical mathematics and show its consequences for history of mathematics and mathematics education.",
    "We show that in a non-equilibrium system of an exciton-polariton condensate, where polaritons are generated from incoherent pumping, a ring-shaped pump allows for stationary vortex memory elements of topological charge $m = 1$ or $m = -1$. Using simple potential guides we can choose whether to copy the same charge or invert it onto another spatially separate ring pump. Such manipulation of binary information opens the possibility of a new type processing using vortices as topologically protected memory components.",
    "During the three years long assessment phase of the LOFT mission, candidate to the M3 launch opportunity of the ESA Cosmic Vision programme, we estimated and measured the radiation damage of the silicon drift detectors (SDDs) of the satellite instrumentation. In particular, we irradiated the detectors with protons (of 0.8 and 11 MeV energy) to study the increment of leakage current and the variation of the charge collection efficiency produced by the displacement damage, and we \"bombarded\" the detectors with hypervelocity dust grains to measure the effect of the debris impacts. In this paper we describe the measurements and discuss the results in the context of the LOFT mission.",
    "In this paper we examine the ability of low-level multimodal features to extract movie similarity, in the context of a content-based movie recommendation approach. In particular, we demonstrate the extraction of multimodal representation models of movies, based on textual information from subtitles, as well as cues from the audio and visual channels. With regards to the textual domain, we emphasize our research in topic modeling of movies based on their subtitles, in order to extract topics that discriminate between movies. Regarding the visual domain, we focus on the extraction of semantically useful features that model camera movements, colors and faces, while for the audio domain we adopt simple classification aggregates based on pretrained models. The three domains are combined with static metadata (e.g. directors, actors) to prove that the content-based movie similarity procedure can be enhanced with low-level multimodal information. In order to demonstrate the proposed content representation approach, we have built a small dataset of 160 widely known movies. We assert movie similarities, as propagated by the individual modalities and fusion models, in the form of recommendation rankings. Extensive experimentation proves that all three low-level modalities (text, audio and visual) boost the performance of a content-based recommendation system, compared to the typical metadata-based content representation, by more than $50\\%$ relative increase. To our knowledge, this is the first approach that utilizes a wide range of features from all involved modalities, in order to enhance the performance of the content similarity estimation, compared to the metadata-based approaches.",
    "We study black hole radiation of a Reissner-Nordstrom black hole with an electric charge in the framework of quantum gravity. Based on a canonical quantization for a spherically symmetric geometry, under physically plausible assumptions, we solve the Wheeler-De Witt equation in the regions not only between the outer apparent horizon and the spatial infinity but also between the spacetime singularity and the inner apparent horizon, and then show that the mass loss rate of an evaporating black hole due to thermal radiation agrees with the semiclassical result when we choose an integration constant properly by physical reasoning. Furthermore, we also solve the Wheeler-De Witt equation in the region between the inner Cauchy horizon and the outer apparent horizon, and show that the mass loss rate of an evaporating black hole has the same expression. The present study is the natural generalization of the case of a Schwarzschild black hole to that of a charged Reissner-Nordstrom black hole.",
    "We present multi-agent A* (MAA*), the first complete and optimal heuristic search algorithm for solving decentralized partially-observable Markov decision problems (DEC-POMDPs) with finite horizon. The algorithm is suitable for computing optimal plans for a cooperative group of agents that operate in a stochastic environment such as multirobot coordination, network traffic control, `or distributed resource allocation. Solving such problems efiectively is a major challenge in the area of planning under uncertainty. Our solution is based on a synthesis of classical heuristic search and decentralized control theory. Experimental results show that MAA* has significant advantages. We introduce an anytime variant of MAA* and conclude with a discussion of promising extensions such as an approach to solving infinite horizon problems.",
    "We present morphological classifications obtained using machine learning for objects in SDSS DR6 that have been classified by Galaxy Zoo into three classes, namely early types, spirals and point sources/artifacts. An artificial neural network is trained on a subset of objects classified by the human eye and we test whether the machine learning algorithm can reproduce the human classifications for the rest of the sample. We find that the success of the neural network in matching the human classifications depends crucially on the set of input parameters chosen for the machine-learning algorithm. The colours and parameters associated with profile-fitting are reasonable in separating the objects into three classes. However, these results are considerably improved when adding adaptive shape parameters as well as concentration and texture. The adaptive moments, concentration and texture parameters alone cannot distinguish between early type galaxies and the point sources/artifacts. Using a set of twelve parameters, the neural network is able to reproduce the human classifications to better than 90% for all three morphological classes. We find that using a training set that is incomplete in magnitude does not degrade our results given our particular choice of the input parameters to the network. We conclude that it is promising to use machine- learning algorithms to perform morphological classification for the next generation of wide-field imaging surveys and that the Galaxy Zoo catalogue provides an invaluable training set for such purposes.",
    "The Lambek calculus is a well-known logical formalism for modelling natural language syntax. The original calculus covered a substantial number of intricate natural language phenomena, but only those restricted to the context-free setting. In order to address more subtle linguistic issues, the Lambek calculus has been extended in various ways. In particular, Morrill and Valentin (2015) introduce an extension with so-called exponential and bracket modalities. Their extension is based on a non-standard contraction rule for the exponential that interacts with the bracket structure in an intricate way. The standard contraction rule is not admissible in this calculus. In this paper we prove undecidability of the derivability problem in their calculus. We also investigate restricted decidable fragments considered by Morrill and Valentin and we show that these fragments belong to the NP class.",
    "The transition between the two phases of 4D Euclidean Dynamical Triangulation [1] was long believed to be of second order until in 1996 first order behavior was found for sufficiently large systems [5,9]. However, one may wonder if this finding was affected by the numerical methods used: to control volume fluctuations, in both studies [5,9] an artificial harmonic potential was added to the action; in [9] measurements were taken after a fixed number of accepted instead of attempted moves which introduces an additional error. Finally the simulations suffer from strong critical slowing down which may have been underestimated. In the present work, we address the above weaknesses: we allow the volume to fluctuate freely within a fixed interval; we take measurements after a fixed number of attempted moves; and we overcome critical slowing down by using an optimized parallel tempering algorithm [12]. With these improved methods, on systems of size up to 64k 4-simplices, we confirm that the phase transition is first order. In addition, we discuss a local criterion to decide whether parts of a triangulation are in the elongated or crumpled state and describe a new correspondence between EDT and the balls in boxes model. The latter gives rise to a modified partition function with an additional, third coupling. Finally, we propose and motivate a class of modified path-integral measures that might remove the metastability of the Markov chain and turn the phase transition into second order.",
    "We characterize the virtually nilpotent finitely generated groups (or, equivalently by Gromov's theorem, groups of polynomial growth) for which the Domino Problem is decidable: These are the virtually free groups, i.e. finite groups, and those having $\\Z$ as a subgroup of finite index.",
    "Gamma rays from the annihilation of dark matter particles in the Galactic halo provide a particularly promising means of indirectly detecting dark matter. Here, we demonstrate that pronounced spectral features at energies near the dark matter particles' mass, which are a generic prediction for most models, can significantly improve the sensitivity of gamma-ray telescopes to dark matter signals. We derive projected limits on such features (including the traditionally looked-for line signals) and show that they can be much more efficient in constraining the nature of dark matter than the model-independent broad spectral features expected at lower energies.",
    "The attainment of carbon neutrality requires a research agenda that addresses the technical and economic challenges that will be encountered as we progress toward 100% renewable electricity generation. Increasing proportions of variable renewable energy (VRE) sources (such as wind turbines and photovoltaic systems) render the supply-and-demand balance of VRE-dominated power grids difficult. The operational characteristics and effects of VRE inverters also require attention. Here, we examine the implications of the paradigm shift to carbon neutrality and summarize the associated research challenges in terms of system planning, operation, and sta-bility, and the need for energy storage integration, demand-side participation, distributed con-trol and estimation, and energy sector coupling. We also highlight the existing literature gaps, and our recent studies that can fill in the gaps, thereby facilitating the improvement of grid op-eration and estimation. The numerical results of comparative case studies are also provided on the operational stability and economics of power grids with a high level of VRE sources, assist-ing stakeholders in establishing specific roadmaps and making relevant decisions.",
    "Convolutional neural networks (CNN) are increasingly used in many areas of computer vision. They are particularly attractive because of their ability to \"absorb\" great quantities of labeled data through millions of parameters. However, as model sizes increase, so do the storage and memory requirements of the classifiers. We present a novel network architecture, Frequency-Sensitive Hashed Nets (FreshNets), which exploits inherent redundancy in both convolutional layers and fully-connected layers of a deep learning model, leading to dramatic savings in memory and storage consumption. Based on the key observation that the weights of learned convolutional filters are typically smooth and low-frequency, we first convert filter weights to the frequency domain with a discrete cosine transform (DCT) and use a low-cost hash function to randomly group frequency parameters into hash buckets. All parameters assigned the same hash bucket share a single value learned with standard back-propagation. To further reduce model size we allocate fewer hash buckets to high-frequency components, which are generally less important. We evaluate FreshNets on eight data sets, and show that it leads to drastically better compressed performance than several relevant baselines.",
    "We conducted a Project-Based Learning (PBL)-type exercise incorporating Japanese cartoon (manga) techniques into Requirements Development (RD) processes. Manga has established techniques, such as those for character setting and story development, that we thought are also valid for RD processes. Using this manga-driven method, students were able to clarify high-level project goals early in the development life-cycle, and succeeded in defining high quality and unique system ideas.",
    "The standard Hawking formula predicts the complete evaporation of black holes. Taking into account effects of quantum gravity, we investigate fermions' tunnelling from a 5-dimensional rotating black string. The temperature is determined not only by the string, but also affected by the quantum number of the emitted fermion and the effect of the extra spatial dimension. The quantum correction slows down the increase of the temperature, which naturally leads to the remnant in the evaporation.",
    "We introduce second-order vector representations of words, induced from nearest neighborhood topological features in pre-trained contextual word embeddings. We then analyze the effects of using second-order embeddings as input features in two deep natural language processing models, for named entity recognition and recognizing textual entailment, as well as a linear model for paraphrase recognition. Surprisingly, we find that nearest neighbor information alone is sufficient to capture most of the performance benefits derived from using pre-trained word embeddings. Furthermore, second-order embeddings are able to handle highly heterogeneous data better than first-order representations, though at the cost of some specificity. Additionally, augmenting contextual embeddings with second-order information further improves model performance in some cases. Due to variance in the random initializations of word embeddings, utilizing nearest neighbor features from multiple first-order embedding samples can also contribute to downstream performance gains. Finally, we identify intriguing characteristics of second-order embedding spaces for further research, including much higher density and different semantic interpretations of cosine similarity.",
    "RIS-aided millimeter wave wireless systems benefit from robustness to blockage and enhanced coverage. In this paper, we study the ability of RIS to also provide enhanced localization capabilities as a by-product of communication. We consider sparse reconstruction algorithms to obtain high resolution channel estimates that are mapped to position information. In RIS-aided mmWave systems, the complexity of sparse recovery becomes a bottleneck, given the large number of elements of the RIS and the large communication arrays. We propose to exploit a multidimensional orthogonal matching pursuit strategy for compressive channel estimation in a RIS-aided millimeter wave system. We show how this algorithm, based on computing the projections on a set of independent dictionaries instead of a single large dictionary, enables high accuracy channel estimation at reduced complexity. We also combine this strategy with a localization approach which does not rely on the absolute time of arrival of the LoS path. Localization results in a realistic 3D indoor scenario show that RIS-aided wireless system can also benefit from a significant improvement in localization accuracy.",
    "Detection and quantification of information leaks through timing side channels are important to guarantee confidentiality. Although static analysis remains the prevalent approach for detecting timing side channels, it is computationally challenging for real-world applications. In addition, the detection techniques are usually restricted to 'yes' or 'no' answers. In practice, real-world applications may need to leak information about the secret. Therefore, quantification techniques are necessary to evaluate the resulting threats of information leaks. Since both problems are very difficult or impossible for static analysis techniques, we propose a dynamic analysis method. Our novel approach is to split the problem into two tasks. First, we learn a timing model of the program as a neural network. Second, we analyze the neural network to quantify information leaks. As demonstrated in our experiments, both of these tasks are feasible in practice --- making the approach a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art side channel detectors and quantifiers. Our key technical contributions are (a) a neural network architecture that enables side channel discovery and (b) an MILP-based algorithm to estimate the side-channel strength. On a set of micro-benchmarks and real-world applications, we show that neural network models learn timing behaviors of programs with thousands of methods. We also show that neural networks with thousands of neurons can be efficiently analyzed to detect and quantify information leaks through timing side channels.",
    "The inner asteroid belt between 2.1 and 2.5 au is of particular dynamical significance because it is the dominant source of both chondritic meteorites and near-Earth asteroids. This inner belt is bounded by an eccentricity-type secular resonance and by the 1:3 mean motion resonance with Jupiter. Unless asteroid perihelia are low enough to allow scattering by Mars, escape requires transport to one of the bounding resonances. In addition Yarkovsky forces are generally ineffective in changing either the eccentricity and/or inclination for asteroids with diameter $\\gtrsim$30 km. Thus, large asteroids with pericentres far from Mars may only escape from the inner belt through large changes in their eccentricities. In this paper we study chaotic diffusion of orbits near the 1:2 mean motion resonance with Mars in a systematic way. We show that, while chaotic orbital evolution in both resonant and non-resonant orbits increase the dispersion of the inclinations and eccentricities, it does not significantly change their mean values. We show further that, while the dispersive growth is greatest for resonant orbits, at high $e$ the resonance acts to mitigate asteroid scattering by Mars - making the asteroid lifetime in the belt longer than it would have been for a non-resonant orbit. For asteroids of all sizes in both resonant and non-resonant orbits, the changes in eccentricity needed to account for the observations cannot be achieved by gravitational forces alone. The role of resonant trapping in protecting asteroids from encounters with Mars is also analysed.",
    "The presence of nonstandard neutrino interactions (NSI) has a large effect on the precision measurements at next generation neutrino oscillation experiments. Other type of experiments are needed to constrain the NSI parameter space. We study the constraints on NSI with electrons from current and future $e^+e^-$ collider experiments including Belle II, STCF and CEPC. We find that Belle II and STCF will provide competitive and complementary bounds on electron-type NSI parameters compared to the current global analysis, and strong improvements for the constraints on tau-type NSI. In addition, CEPC alone will impose stringent constraints on the parameter space of NSI with electrons. We find that the degeneracy between the left-handed (vector) and right-handed (axial-vector) NSI parameters can be lifted by combining the data from three different running modes, and the allowed ranges for $|\\epsilon_{ee}^{eL}|$ ($|\\epsilon_{ee}^{eV}|$) and $|\\epsilon_{ee}^{eR}|$ ($|\\epsilon_{ee}^{eA}|$) can be constrained to be smaller than 0.002 at CEPC even if both of them are present.",
    "The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) is a leading-edge experiment designed to perform neutrino science and proton decay searches. In particular, the far detector will consist of four 10-kton Liquid Argon (LAr) Time Projection Chambers using both single and dual-phase technologies. The latter provides charge amplification in the gaseous phase. In order to optimize these designs, two large prototypes are taking data at CERN since 2018. Previously, a dual-phase 4-tonne demonstrator was constructed and exposed to cosmic muons in 2017 and exhibited good performance in terms of charge and light collection. The light detection system is important to provide a trigger to the charge acquisition system and to obtain additional information from the scintillation light produced in the particle interaction. In the demonstrator, five cryogenic photo-multipliers were installed with different base polarity configurations and wavelength shifting methods. During the detector operation, scintillation light data were collected in different drift and amplification field conditions. An overview of the light detection system performance and results on the light production and propagation are presented. Our studies allowed to improve the understanding of some LAr properties.",
    "Major chip manufacturers have all introduced Multithreaded processors. These processors are used for running a variety of workloads. Efficient resource utilization is an important design aspect in such processors. Particularly, it is important to take advantage of available memory-level parallelism(MLP). In this paper I propose a MLP aware operating system (OS) scheduling algorithm for Multithreaded Multi-core processors. By observing the MLP available in each thread and by balancing it with available MLP resources in the system the OS will come up with a new schedule of threads for the next quantum that could potentially improve overall performance. We do a qualitative comparison of our solution with other hardware and software techniques. This work can be extended by doing a quantitative evaluation and by further refining the scheduling optimization.",
    "We consider the problem of calibrating a compressed sensing measurement system under the assumption that the decalibration consists in unknown gains on each measure. We focus on {\\em blind} calibration, using measures performed on a few unknown (but sparse) signals. A naive formulation of this blind calibration problem, using $\\ell_{1}$ minimization, is reminiscent of blind source separation and dictionary learning, which are known to be highly non-convex and riddled with local minima. In the considered context, we show that in fact this formulation can be exactly expressed as a convex optimization problem, and can be solved using off-the-shelf algorithms. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach even for highly uncalibrated measures, when a sufficient number of (unknown, but sparse) calibrating signals is provided. We observe that the success/failure of the approach seems to obey sharp phase transitions.",
    "We explore the task of multi-source morphological reinflection, which generalizes the standard, single-source version. The input consists of (i) a target tag and (ii) multiple pairs of source form and source tag for a lemma. The motivation is that it is beneficial to have access to more than one source form since different source forms can provide complementary information, e.g., different stems. We further present a novel extension to the encoder- decoder recurrent neural architecture, consisting of multiple encoders, to better solve the task. We show that our new architecture outperforms single-source reinflection models and publish our dataset for multi-source morphological reinflection to facilitate future research.",
    "An increasing number of use cases require a timely extraction of non-trivial knowledge from semantically annotated data streams, especially on the Web and for the Internet of Things (IoT). Often, this extraction requires expressive reasoning, which is challenging to compute on large streams. We propose Laser, a new reasoner that supports a pragmatic, non-trivial fragment of the logic LARS which extends Answer Set Programming (ASP) for streams. At its core, Laser implements a novel evaluation procedure which annotates formulae to avoid the re-computation of duplicates at multiple time points. This procedure, combined with a judicious implementation of the LARS operators, is responsible for significantly better runtimes than the ones of other state-of-the-art systems like C-SPARQL and CQELS, or an implementation of LARS which runs on the ASP solver Clingo. This enables the application of expressive logic-based reasoning to large streams and opens the door to a wider range of stream reasoning use cases.",
    "The second law of thermodynamics dictates the fundamental limits to the amount of energy and information that can be exchanged between physical systems. In this work, we extend a thermodynamic formalism describing this flow of energy and information developed for a pair of bipartite systems to many multipartite systems. We identify a natural thermodynamic quantity that describes the information exchanged among these systems. We then introduce and discuss a refined version. Our results are illustrated with a model of two, competing Maxwell demons.",
    "The negligible intrinsic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in graphene can be enhanced by proximity effects in stacked heterostructures of graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs). The composition of the TMDC layer plays a key role in determining the nature and strength of the resultant SOC induced in the graphene layer. Here, we study the evolution of the proximity-induced SOC as the TMDC layer is deliberately defected. Alloyed ${\\rm G/W_{\\chi}Mo_{1-\\chi}Se_2}$ heterostructures with diverse compositions ($\\chi$) and defect distributions are simulated using density functional theory. Comparison with continuum and tight-binding models allows both local and global signatures of the metal-atom alloying to be clarified. Our findings show that, despite some dramatic perturbation of local parameters for individual defects, the low-energy spin and electronic behaviour follow a simple effective medium model which depends only on the composition ratio of the metallic species in the TMDC layer. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the topological state of such alloyed systems can be feasibly tuned by controlling this ratio.",
    "Atomic masses play a crucial role in many nuclear astrophysics calculations. The lack of experimental values for relevant exotic nuclides triggered a rapid development of new mass measurement devices around the world. The Time-of-Flight (TOF) mass measurements offer a complementary technique to the most precise one, Penning trap measurements, the latter being limited by the rate and half-lives of the ions of interest. The NSCL facility provides a well-suited infrastructure for TOF mass measurements of very exotic nuclei. At this facility, we have recently implemented a TOF-Brho technique and performed mass measurements of neutron-rich nuclides in the Fe region, important for r-process calculations and for calculations of processes occurring in the crust of accreting neutron stars.",
    "Although the super-massive (AGN) and stellar mass (XRBs) black holes have many properties in common, the broad emission lines (BELs) are exclusively signatures of the AGN. Based on the detection of these lines from SDSS data bases, there seems to be no AGN with mass M_BH \\lesssim 10^5 M_sun. In this paper we investigate if such low mass black holes are really non-existent or they are undetected because the BELs in them are not produced efficiently. Using the ionizing spectral energy distribution for a wide range of black hole mass, 10 - 10^9 M_sun, spanning XRBs to AGN, we calculate the equivalent widths (EWs) of ultraviolet and optical lines Ly\\alpha 1216 \\AA, H\\beta 4861 \\AA, CIV 1549 \\AA and MgII 2798 \\AA. The LOC (locally optimally emitting cloud) model has been used to describe the broad emission line region (BELR) for the calculations. We find that the hardening of the SED shape with decreasing mass do not decrease the BEL EWs. However, finite size of the BELR, as measured by the line widths, which is controlled by the mass of the black hole, regulates the production of these emission lines. There seems to be a peak in the EWs of the emission lines for typical AGN black holes of ~ 10^8 M_sun, below which the lines become intrinsically fainter with a sharp fall-off below ~ 10^6 M_sun. This may be the cause of the absence of low mass AGN in SDSS.",
    "The precision of synchronization algorithms based on the theory of pulse-coupled oscillators is evaluated on FPGA-based radios for the first time. Measurements show that such algorithms can reach precision in the low microsecond range when being implemented in the physical layer. Furthermore, we propose an algorithm extension accounting for phase rate deviations of the hardware and show that an improved precision below one microsecond is possible with this extension in the given setup. The resulting algorithm can thus be applied in ad hoc wireless systems for fully distributed synchronization of transmission slots or sleep cycles, in particular, if centralized synchronization is impossible.",
    "Human Trajectory Prediction (HTP) has gained much momentum in the last years and many solutions have been proposed to solve it. Proper benchmarking being a key issue for comparing methods, this paper addresses the question of evaluating how complex is a given dataset with respect to the prediction problem. For assessing a dataset complexity, we define a series of indicators around three concepts: Trajectory predictability; Trajectory regularity; Context complexity. We compare the most common datasets used in HTP in the light of these indicators and discuss what this may imply on benchmarking of HTP algorithms. Our source code is released on Github.",
    "The purpose of this paper is to show how a class of classical linear stochastic systems can be physically implemented using quantum optical components. Quantum optical systems typically have much higher bandwidth than electronic devices, meaning faster response and processing times, and hence has the potential for providing better performance than classical systems. A procedure is provided for constructing the quantum optical realization. The paper also describes the use of the quantum optical realization in a measurement feedback loop. Some examples are given to illustrate the application of the main results.",
    "Systems biology uses large networks of biochemical reactions to model the functioning of biological cells from the molecular to the cellular scale. The dynamics of dissipative reaction networks with many well separated time scales can be described as a sequence of successive equilibrations of different subsets of variables of the system. Polynomial systems with separation are equilibrated when at least two monomials, of opposite signs, have the same order of magnitude and dominate the others. These equilibrations and the corresponding truncated dynamics, obtained by eliminating the dominated terms, find a natural formulation in tropical analysis and can be used for model reduction.",
    "We performed spectral analysis of Suzaku data of the galactic disk and outflow regions of the starburst galaxy M82. Thermal modeling of the central disk regions requires at least three temperature components. The Ly$\\beta$ line fluxes of O VIII and Ne X exceed those expected from a plasma in collisional ionization equilibrium. The ratios of Ly$\\beta$/Ly$\\alpha$ lines for O VIII and Ne X are higher than those of collisional ionization equilibrium, which may be caused by the process of charge exchange. In the outflow wind region, the spectra are well reproduced with two-temperature thermal models, and we have derived the metal abundances of O, Ne, Mg, and Fe in the outflow. The ratios of O/Fe, Ne/Fe, and Mg/Fe are about 2, 3, and 2, respectively, relative to the solar value determined by Lodders (2003). Since there is no evidence of charge exchange in outflow region, the metal abundances should be more reliable than those in the central region. This abundance pattern indicates that starburst activity enriches the outflow through SN II metal ejection into intergalactic space.",
    "Dust grains are classically thought to form in the winds of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. However, there is increasing evidence today for dust formation in supernovae (SNe). To establish the relative importance of these two classes of stellar sources of dust, it is important to know the fraction of freshly formed dust in SN ejecta that is able to survive the passage of the reverse shock and be injected in the interstellar medium. We have developed a new code (GRASH\\_Rev) which follows the newly-formed dust evolution throughout the supernova explosion until the merging of the forward shock with the circumstellar ISM. We have considered four well studied SNe in the Milky Way and Large Magellanic Cloud: SN1987A, CasA, the Crab Nebula, and N49. For all the simulated models, we find good agreement with observations and estimate that between 1 and 8$\\%$ of the observed mass will survive, leading to a SN dust production rate of $(3.9 \\pm 3.7) \\times 10^{-4}$ M$_{\\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ in the Milky Way. This value is one order of magnitude larger than the dust production rate by AGB stars but insufficient to counterbalance the dust destruction by SNe, therefore requiring dust accretion in the gas phase.",
    "This paper investigates in hatching process strategies for additive manufacturing using an electron beam by numerical simulations. The underlying physical model and the corresponding three dimensional thermal free surface lattice Boltzmann method of the simulation software are briefly presented. The simulation software has already been validated on the basis of experiments up to 1.2 kW beam power by hatching a cuboid with a basic process strategy, whereby the results are classified into `porous', `good' and `uneven', depending on their relative density and top surface smoothness. In this paper we study the limitations of this basic process strategy in terms of higher beam powers and scan velocities to exploit the future potential of high power electron beam guns up to 10 kW. Subsequently, we introduce modified process strategies, which circumvent these restrictions, to build the part as fast as possible under the restriction of a fully dense part with a smooth top surface. These process strategies are suitable to reduce the build time and costs, maximize the beam power usage and therefore use the potential of high power electron beam guns.",
    "Bayesian optimization (BO) is a class of global optimization algorithms, suitable for minimizing an expensive objective function in as few function evaluations as possible. While BO budgets are typically given in iterations, this implicitly measures convergence in terms of iteration count and assumes each evaluation has identical cost. In practice, evaluation costs may vary in different regions of the search space. For example, the cost of neural network training increases quadratically with layer size, which is a typical hyperparameter. Cost-aware BO measures convergence with alternative cost metrics such as time, energy, or money, for which vanilla BO methods are unsuited. We introduce Cost Apportioned BO (CArBO), which attempts to minimize an objective function in as little cost as possible. CArBO combines a cost-effective initial design with a cost-cooled optimization phase which depreciates a learned cost model as iterations proceed. On a set of 20 black-box function optimization problems we show that, given the same cost budget, CArBO finds significantly better hyperparameter configurations than competing methods.",
    "This work contributes a marsupial robotic system-of-systems involving a legged and an aerial robot capable of collaborative mapping and exploration path planning that exploits the heterogeneous properties of the two systems and the ability to selectively deploy the aerial system from the ground robot. Exploiting the dexterous locomotion capabilities and long endurance of quadruped robots, the marsupial combination can explore within large-scale and confined environments involving rough terrain. However, as certain types of terrain or vertical geometries can render any ground system unable to continue its exploration, the marsupial system can - when needed - deploy the flying robot which, by exploiting its 3D navigation capabilities, can undertake a focused exploration task within its endurance limitations. Focusing on autonomy, the two systems can co-localize and map together by sharing LiDAR-based maps and plan exploration paths individually, while a tailored graph search onboard the legged robot allows it to identify where and when the ferried aerial platform should be deployed. The system is verified within multiple experimental studies demonstrating the expanded exploration capabilities of the marsupial system-of-systems and facilitating the exploration of otherwise individually unreachable areas.",
    "We propose a method for polarising antiprotons in a storage ring by means of a polarised positron beam moving parallel to the antiprotons. If the relative velocity is adjusted to $v/c \\approx 0.002$ the cross section for spin-flip is as large as about $2 \\cdot 10^{13}$ barn as shown by new QED-calculations of the triple spin-cross sections. Two possibilities for providing a positron source with sufficient flux density are presented. A polarised positron beam with a polarisation of 0.70 and a flux density of approximately $1.5 \\cdot 10^{10}$/(mm$^2$ s) appears to be feasible by means of a radioactive $^{11}$C dc-source. A more involved proposal is the production of polarised positrons by pair production with circularly polarised photons. It yields a polarisation of 0.76 and requires the injection into a small storage ring. Such polariser sources can be used at low (100 MeV) as well as at high (1 GeV) energy storage rings providing a time of about one hour for polarisation build-up of about $10^{10}$ antiprotons to a polarisation of about 0.18. A comparison with other proposals show a gain in the figure-of-merit by a factor of about ten.",
    "Loops are essential secondary structure elements in folded DNA and RNA molecules and proliferate close to the melting transition. Using a theory for nucleic acid secondary structures that accounts for the logarithmic entropy c ln m for a loop of length m, we study homopolymeric single-stranded nucleic acid chains under external force and varying temperature. In the thermodynamic limit of a long strand, the chain displays a phase transition between a low temperature / low force compact (folded) structure and a high temperature / high force molten (unfolded) structure. The influence of c on phase diagrams, critical exponents, melting, and force extension curves is derived analytically. For vanishing pulling force, only for the limited range of loop exponents 2 < c < 2.479 a melting transition is possible; for c <= 2 the chain is always in the folded phase and for 2.479 < c always in the unfolded phase. A force induced melting transition with singular behavior is possible for all loop exponents c < 2.479 and can be observed experimentally by single molecule force spectroscopy. These findings have implications for the hybridization or denaturation of double stranded nucleic acids. The Poland-Scheraga model for nucleic acid duplex melting does not allow base pairing between nucleotides on the same strand in denatured regions of the double strand. If the sequence allows these intra-strand base pairs, we show that for a realistic loop exponent c ~ 2.1 pronounced secondary structures appear inside the single strands. This leads to a lower melting temperature of the duplex than predicted by the Poland-Scheraga model. Further, these secondary structures renormalize the effective loop exponent c^, which characterizes the weight of a denatured region of the double strand, and thus affect universal aspects of the duplex melting transition.",
    "We study the Zeeman spin-splitting in hole quantum wires oriented along the $[011]$ and $[01\\bar{1}]$ crystallographic axes of a high mobility undoped (100)-oriented AlGaAs/GaAs heterostructure. Our data shows that the spin-splitting can be switched `on' (finite $g^{*}$) or `off' (zero $g^{*}$) by rotating the field from a parallel to a perpendicular orientation with respect to the wire, and the properties of the wire are identical for the two orientations with respect to the crystallographic axes. We also find that the $g$-factor in the parallel orientation decreases as the wire is narrowed. This is in contrast to electron quantum wires, where the $g$-factor is enhanced by exchange effects as the wire is narrowed. This is evidence for a $k$-dependent Zeeman splitting that arises from the spin-3/2 nature of holes.",
    "An analogy with real Clifford algebras on even-dimensional vector spaces suggests to assign a couple of space and time dimensions modulo 8 to any algebra (represented over a complex Hilbert space) containing two self-adjoint involutions and an anti-unitary operator with specific commutation relations. It is shown that this assignment is compatible with the tensor product: the space and time dimensions of the tensor product are the sums of the space and time dimensions of its factors. This could provide an interpretation of the presence of such algebras in PT-symmetric Hamiltonians or the description of topological matter. This construction is used to build an indefinite (i.e. pseudo-Riemannian) version of the spectral triples of noncommutative geometry, defined over Krein spaces instead of Hilbert spaces. Within this framework, we can express the Lagrangian (both bosonic and fermionic) of a Lorentzian almost-commutative spectral triple. We exhibit a space of physical states that solves the fermion-doubling problem. The example of quantum electrodynamics is described.",
    "We study the space-time symmetries of the actions obtained by expanding the action for a massive free relativistic particle around the Galilean action. We obtain all the point space-time symmetries of the post-Galilean actions by working in canonical space. We also construct an infinite collection of generalized Schr\\\"odinger algebras parameterized by an integer $M$, with $M=0$ corresponding to the standard Schr\\\"odinger algebra. We discuss the Schr\\\"odinger equations associated to these algebras, their solutions and projective phases.",
    "Accretion disc theory is less developed than stellar evolution theory although a similarly mature phenomenological picture is ultimately desired. While the interplay of theory and numerical simulations has amplified community awareness of the role of magnetic fields in angular momentum transport, there remains a long term challenge to incorporate insight gained from simulations back into improving practical models for comparison with observations. Here we emphasize the need to incorporate the role of non-local transport more precisely. To show where large scale transport would fit into the theoretical framework and how it is currently missing, we review why the wonderfully practical approach of Shakura-Sunyaev (1973,SS73) is necessarily a mean field theory, and one which does not include large scale transport. Observations of coronae and jets combined with the interpretation of results even from shearing box simulations of the magnetorotational instability (MRI) suggest that a significant fraction of disc transport is indeed non-local. We show that the Maxwell stresses in saturation are dominated by large scale contributions and the physics of MRI transport is not fully captured by a viscosity. We also clarify the standard physical interpretation of the MRi as it applies to shearing boxes. Computational limitations have so far focused most attention toward local simulations but the next generation of global simulations should help to inform improved mean field theories. Mean field accretion theory and mean field dynamo theory should in fact be unified into a single theory that predicts the time evolution of spectra and luminosity from separate disc, corona, and outflow contributions. Finally, we note that any mean field theory has a finite predictive precision that needs to be quantified when comparing the predictions to observations.",
    "This paper is devoted to the global well-posedness of two Diffuse Interface systems modeling the motion of an incompressible two-phase fluid mixture in presence of capillarity effects in a bounded smooth domain $\\Omega\\subset \\mathbb{R}^d$, $d=2,3$. We focus on dissipative mixing effects originating from the mass-conserving Allen-Cahn dynamics with the physically relevant Flory-Huggins potential. More precisely, we study the mass-conserving Navier-Stokes-Allen-Cahn system for nonhomogeneous fluids and the mass-conserving Euler-Allen-Cahn system for homogeneous fluids. We prove existence and uniqueness of global weak and strong solutions as well as their property of separation from the pure states. In our analysis, we combine the energy and entropy estimates, a novel end-point estimate of the product of two functions, a new estimate for the Stokes problem with non-constant viscosity, and logarithmic type Gronwall arguments.",

    "In this talk we discuss mathematical structures associated to Feynman graphs. Feynman graphs are the backbone of calculations in perturbative quantum field theory. The mathematical structures -- apart from being of interest in their own right -- allow to derive algorithms for the computation of these graphs. Topics covered are the relations of Feynman integrals to periods, shuffle algebras and multiple polylogarithms.",
    "We report on a calculation of the generalized parton distributions of the photon when there is non-zero momentum transfer both in the transverse and longitudinal directions. By taking Fourier transforms of the GPDs with respect transverse and longitudinal momentum transfer, we obtain the parton distributions of the photon in position space.",
    "Transformers have reached remarkable success in sequence modeling. However, these models have efficiency issues as they need to store all the history token-level representations as memory. We present Memformer, an efficient neural network for sequence modeling, that utilizes an external dynamic memory to encode and retrieve past information. Our model achieves linear time complexity and constant memory space complexity when processing long sequences. We also propose a new optimization scheme, memory replay back-propagation (MRBP), which promotes long-range back-propagation through time with a significantly reduced memory requirement. Experimental results show that Memformer has achieved comparable performance compared to the baselines by using 8.1x less memory space and 3.2x faster on inference. Analysis of the attention pattern shows that our external memory slots can encode and retain important information through timesteps.",
    "We compute the leading logarithmic behaviour of the cross-section for the production of a pseudoscalar Higgs boson in gluon-gluon fusion to all-orders in perturbation theory, in the limit of large partonic centre of mass energy. We also calculate the Higgs rapidity distribution to the same accuracy. We include the contributions of top and bottom quarks, together with their interference. Our results are given in terms of single and double integrals, evaluated explicitly up to next-to next-to leading order (NNLO). We use our results to improve the known NNLO inclusive cross-section computed in the effective theory where the fermions in the loop are integrated out. The size of finite fermion mass effects on the inclusive cross-section is found to be small, reaching a few percent only for large values of the pseudoscalar mass.",
    "Finding outlying elements in probability distributions can be a hard problem. Taking a real example from Voting Rights Act enforcement, we consider the problem of maximizing the number of simultaneous majority-minority districts in a political districting plan. An unbiased random walk on districting plans is unlikely to find plans that approach this maximum. A common search approach is to use a biased random walk: preferentially select districting plans with more majority-minority districts. Here, we present a third option, called short bursts, in which an unbiased random walk is performed for a small number of steps (called the burst length), then re-started from the most extreme plan that was encountered in the last burst. We give empirical evidence that short-burst runs outperform biased random walks for the problem of maximizing the number of majority-minority districts, and that there are many values of burst length for which we see this improvement. Abstracting from our use case, we also consider short bursts where the underlying state space is a line with various probability distributions, and then explore some features of more complicated state spaces and how these impact the effectiveness of short bursts.",
    "We report on a molecular dynamics investigation of the wetting properties of graphitic surfaces by various solutions at concentrations 1-8 wt% of commercially available non-ionic surfactants with long hydrophilic chains, linear or T-shaped. These are surfactants of length up to 160 [\\AA]. It turns out that molecular dynamics simulations of such systems ask for a number of solvent particles that can be reached without seriously compromising computational efficiency only by employing a coarse-grained model. The MARTINI force field with polarizable water offers a framework particularly suited for the parameterization of our systems. In general, its advantages over other coarse-grained models are the possibility to explore faster long time scales and the wider range of applicability. Although the accuracy is sometimes put under question, the results for the wetting properties by pure water are in good agreement with those for the corresponding atomistic systems and theoretical predictions. On the other hand, the bulk properties of various aqueous surfactant solutions indicate that the micellar formation process is too strong. For this reason, a typical experimental configuration is better approached by preparing the droplets with the surfactants arranged in the initial state in the vicinity of contact line. Cross-comparisons are possible and illuminating, but equilibrium contanct angles as obtained from simulations overestimate the experimental results. Nevertheless, our findings can provide guidelines for the preliminary assessment and screening of surfactants. [See pdf file for full abstract]",
    "We review recent experiments in which superfluid $^3$He has been studied under highly controlled confinement in nanofluidic sample chambers. We discuss the experimental challenges and their resolution. These methods open the way to a systematic investigation of the superfluidity of $^3$He films, and the surface and edge excitations of topological superfluids.",
    "Code-mixed machine translation has become an important task in multilingual communities and extending the task of machine translation to code mixed data has become a common task for these languages. In the shared tasks of WMT 2022, we try to tackle the same for both English + Hindi to Hinglish and Hinglish to English. The first task dealt with both Roman and Devanagari script as we had monolingual data in both English and Hindi whereas the second task only had data in Roman script. To our knowledge, we achieved one of the top ROUGE-L and WER scores for the first task of Monolingual to Code-Mixed machine translation. In this paper, we discuss the use of mBART with some special pre-processing and post-processing (transliteration from Devanagari to Roman) for the first task in detail and the experiments that we performed for the second task of translating code-mixed Hinglish to monolingual English.",
    "Contrastive learning has shown promising potential in self-supervised spatio-temporal representation learning. Most works naively sample different clips to construct positive and negative pairs. However, we observe that this formulation inclines the model towards the background scene bias. The underlying reasons are twofold. First, the scene difference is usually more noticeable and easier to discriminate than the motion difference. Second, the clips sampled from the same video often share similar backgrounds but have distinct motions. Simply regarding them as positive pairs will draw the model to the static background rather than the motion pattern. To tackle this challenge, this paper presents a novel dual contrastive formulation. Concretely, we decouple the input RGB video sequence into two complementary modes, static scene and dynamic motion. Then, the original RGB features are pulled closer to the static features and the aligned dynamic features, respectively. In this way, the static scene and the dynamic motion are simultaneously encoded into the compact RGB representation. We further conduct the feature space decoupling via activation maps to distill static- and dynamic-related features. We term our method as \\textbf{D}ual \\textbf{C}ontrastive \\textbf{L}earning for spatio-temporal \\textbf{R}epresentation (DCLR). Extensive experiments demonstrate that DCLR learns effective spatio-temporal representations and obtains state-of-the-art or comparable performance on UCF-101, HMDB-51, and Diving-48 datasets.",
    "The electronic bandstructure and the Fermi surfaces of ferromagnetic CeRh3B2 are calculated by using FLAPW and LSDA+U method. As assuming several kinds of the ground state to describe the 4f electronic state, we propose a fully orbital- and spin-polarized state |lz=0, sx=1/2> as the ground state, instead of the conventional LS-coupled CEF ground state, generally expected in typical 4f compounds. This is supported by the fact that both the observed magnetic moment and the observed dHvA frequencies are well explained by the calculated electronic structure and the Fermi surfaces. The unconventional ground state is stabilized by the strong 4f-4f direct mixing between the neighbored Ce atoms along the extremely small distance along the c-axis in the hexagonal crystal cell.",
    "Matrix acidization simulation is a challenging task in the study of flows in porous media, due to the changing porosity in the procedure. The improved DBF framework is one model to do this simulation, and its numerical scheme discretises the mass and momentum conservation equations together to form a pressure-velocity linear system. However, this linear system can only be solved by direct solvers to solve for pressure and velocity simultaneously, since zeros appear in the diagonal of the coefficient matrix. Considering the large-scale attribute of matrix acidization simulation, the solving time of direct solvers is not intolerant. Thus, a decoupled scheme is proposed in this work to decouple the coupled pressure-velocity linear system into two independent linear systems: one is to solve for pressure, and the other one is to solve for velocity. Both of the new linear systems can be solved by parallel and iterative solvers, which guarantees the large-scale simulation can be finished in a reasonable time period. A numerical experiment is carried out to demonstrate the correctness of the decoupled scheme and its higher computing efficiency.",
    "Sensemaking and narrative are two inherently interconnected concepts about how people understand the world around them. Sensemaking is the process by which people structure and interconnect the information they encounter in the world with the knowledge and inferences they have made in the past. Narratives are important constructs that people use sensemaking to create; ones that reflect provide a more holistic account of the world than the information within any given narrative is able to alone. Both are important to how human beings parse the world, and both would be valuable for a computational system attempting to do the same. In this paper, we discuss theories of sensemaking and narrative with respect to how people build an understanding of the world based on the information they encounter, as well as the links between the fields of sensemaking and narrative research. We highlight a specific computational task, visual storytelling, whose solutions we believe can be enhanced by employing a sensemaking and narrative component. We then describe our system for visual storytelling using sensemaking and narrative and discuss examples from its current implementation.",
    "Evaluation metrics that are not robust to dialect variation make it impossible to tell how well systems perform for many groups of users, and can even penalize systems for producing text in lower-resource dialects. However, currently, there exists no way to quantify how metrics respond to change in the dialect of a generated utterance. We thus formalize dialect robustness and dialect awareness as goals for NLG evaluation metrics. We introduce a suite of methods and corresponding statistical tests one can use to assess metrics in light of the two goals. Applying the suite to current state-of-the-art metrics, we demonstrate that they are not dialect-robust and that semantic perturbations frequently lead to smaller decreases in a metric than the introduction of dialect features. As a first step to overcome this limitation, we propose a training schema, NANO, which introduces regional and language information to the pretraining process of a metric. We demonstrate that NANO provides a size-efficient way for models to improve the dialect robustness while simultaneously improving their performance on the standard metric benchmark.",
    "Geographic routing consists in using the position information of nodes to assist in the routing process, and has been a widely studied subject in sensor networks. One of the outstanding challenges facing geographic routing has been its applicability. Authors either make some broad assumptions on an idealized version of wireless networks which are often unverifiable, or they use costly methods to planarize the communication graph. The overarching questions that drive us are the following. When, and how should we use geographic routing? Is there a criterion to tell whether a communication network is fit for geographic routing? When exactly does geographic routing make sense? In this paper we formulate the four principles that define geographic routing and explore their topological consequences. Given a localized communication network, we then define and compute its geographic eccentricity, which measures its fitness for geographic routing. Finally we propose a distributed algorithm that either enables geographic routing on the network or proves that its geographic eccentricity is too high.",
    "We show that spatial variation and correlation of superconductivity fluctuations in a two-band model are scaled by two characteristic lengths. This results in substantially more complicated picture compared to one-band systems. In particular, short-range correlations are always present in a two-band scenario, even near the phase transition point.",
    "We present online prediction methods for time series that let us explicitly handle nonstationary artifacts (e.g. trend and seasonality) present in most real time series. Specifically, we show that applying appropriate transformations to such time series before prediction can lead to improved theoretical and empirical prediction performance. Moreover, since these transformations are usually unknown, we employ the learning with experts setting to develop a fully online method (NonSTOP-NonSTationary Online Prediction) for predicting nonstationary time series. This framework allows for seasonality and/or other trends in univariate time series and cointegration in multivariate time series. Our algorithms and regret analysis subsume recent related work while significantly expanding the applicability of such methods. For all the methods, we provide sub-linear regret bounds using relaxed assumptions. The theoretical guarantees do not fully capture the benefits of the transformations, thus we provide a data-dependent analysis of the follow-the-leader algorithm that provides insight into the success of using such transformations. We support all of our results with experiments on simulated and real data.",
    "We present a heuristic framework for attacking the undecidable termination problem of logic programs, as an alternative to current termination/non-termination proof approaches. We introduce an idea of termination prediction, which predicts termination of a logic program in case that neither a termination nor a non-termination proof is applicable. We establish a necessary and sufficient characterization of infinite (generalized) SLDNF-derivations with arbitrary (concrete or moded) queries, and develop an algorithm that predicts termination of general logic programs with arbitrary non-floundering queries. We have implemented a termination prediction tool and obtained quite satisfactory experimental results. Except for five programs which break the experiment time limit, our prediction is 100% correct for all 296 benchmark programs of the Termination Competition 2007, of which eighteen programs cannot be proved by any of the existing state-of-the-art analyzers like AProVE07, NTI, Polytool and TALP.",
    "Despite widespread interest and practical use, the theoretical properties of random forests are still not well understood. In this paper we contribute to this understanding in two ways. We present a new theoretically tractable variant of random regression forests and prove that our algorithm is consistent. We also provide an empirical evaluation, comparing our algorithm and other theoretically tractable random forest models to the random forest algorithm used in practice. Our experiments provide insight into the relative importance of different simplifications that theoreticians have made to obtain tractable models for analysis.",
    "Factorial Hidden Markov Models (FHMMs) are powerful models for sequential data but they do not scale well with long sequences. We propose a scalable inference and learning algorithm for FHMMs that draws on ideas from the stochastic variational inference, neural network and copula literatures. Unlike existing approaches, the proposed algorithm requires no message passing procedure among latent variables and can be distributed to a network of computers to speed up learning. Our experiments corroborate that the proposed algorithm does not introduce further approximation bias compared to the proven structured mean-field algorithm, and achieves better performance with long sequences and large FHMMs.",
    "Molecular dynamics simulations have been performed on pure liquid water, aqueous solutions of sodium chloride, and polymer solutions exposed to a strong external electric field with the goal to gain molecular insight into the structural response to the field. Several simulation methodologies have been used to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of the processes leading to the formation of liquid bridges and jets (in the production of nanofibers). It is shown that in the established nanoscale structures, the molecules form a chain with their dipole moments oriented parallel to the applied field throughout the entire sample volume. The presence of ions may disturb this structure leading to its ultimate disintegration into droplets; the concentration dependence of the threshold field required to stabilize a liquid column has been determined. Conformational changes of the polymer in the jetting process have also been observed.",
    "Recommender systems are increasingly used to predict and serve content that aligns with user taste, yet the task of matching new users with relevant content remains a challenge. We consider podcasting to be an emerging medium with rapid growth in adoption, and discuss challenges that arise when applying traditional recommendation approaches to address the cold-start problem. Using music consumption behavior, we examine two main techniques in inferring Spotify users preferences over more than 200k podcasts. Our results show significant improvements in consumption of up to 50\\% for both offline and online experiments. We provide extensive analysis on model performance and examine the degree to which music data as an input source introduces bias in recommendations.",
    "We calculate the Casimir energy and entropy for two perfect metal spheres in the large and short separation limit. We obtain nonmonotonic behavior of the Helmholtz free energy with separation and temperature, leading to parameter ranges with negative entropy, and also nonmonotonic behavior of the entropy with temperature and with the separation between the spheres. The appearance of this anomalous behavior of the entropy is discussed as well as its thermodynamic consequences.",
    "Many important real-world problems have action spaces that are high-dimensional, continuous or both, making full enumeration of all possible actions infeasible. Instead, only small subsets of actions can be sampled for the purpose of policy evaluation and improvement. In this paper, we propose a general framework to reason in a principled way about policy evaluation and improvement over such sampled action subsets. This sample-based policy iteration framework can in principle be applied to any reinforcement learning algorithm based upon policy iteration. Concretely, we propose Sampled MuZero, an extension of the MuZero algorithm that is able to learn in domains with arbitrarily complex action spaces by planning over sampled actions. We demonstrate this approach on the classical board game of Go and on two continuous control benchmark domains: DeepMind Control Suite and Real-World RL Suite.",
    "In this paper, we propose two mask-based beamforming methods using a deep neural network (DNN) trained by multichannel loss functions. Beamforming technique using time-frequency (TF)-masks estimated by a DNN have been applied to many applications where TF-masks are used for estimating spatial covariance matrices. To train a DNN for mask-based beamforming, loss functions designed for monaural speech enhancement/separation have been employed. Although such a training criterion is simple, it does not directly correspond to the performance of mask-based beamforming. To overcome this problem, we use multichannel loss functions which evaluate the estimated spatial covariance matrices based on the multichannel Itakura--Saito divergence. DNNs trained by the multichannel loss functions can be applied to construct several beamformers. Experimental results confirmed their effectiveness and robustness to microphone configurations.",
    "Nano-FTIR imaging is a powerful scanning-based technique at nanometer spatial resolution which combines Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM). However, recording large spatial areas with nano-FTIR is limited by long measurement times due to its sequential data acquisition. Several mathematical approaches have been proposed to tackle this problem. All of them have in common that only a small fraction of randomly chosen measurements is required. However, choosing the fraction of measurements in a random fashion poses practical challenges for scanning procedures and does not lead to time savings as large as desired. We consider different, practically relevant sub-sampling schemes assuring a faster acquisition. It is demonstrated that results for almost all considered sub-sampling schemes, namely original Lissajous, triangle Lissajous, and random reflection sub-sampling, at a sub-sampling rate of 10%, are comparable to results when using a random sub-sampling of 10%. This implies that random sub-sampling is not required for efficient data acquisition.",
    "We determine from Polyakov loop correlators the screening masses in th e deconfined phase of the (3+1)d SU(3) pure gauge theory at finite temperature near transition, for two different channels of angular momentum and parity. Their ratio is compared with that of the massive excitations with the same quantum numbers in the 3d 3-state Potts model in the broken phase near the transition point at zero magnetic field. Moreover we study the inverse decay length of the correlation between the real parts and between the imaginary parts of the Polyakov loop and compare the results with expectations from perturbation theory and mean-field Polyakov loop models.",
    "The Mahalanobis distance-based confidence score, a recently proposed anomaly detection method for pre-trained neural classifiers, achieves state-of-the-art performance on both out-of-distribution (OoD) and adversarial examples detection. This work analyzes why this method exhibits such strong performance in practical settings while imposing an implausible assumption; namely, that class conditional distributions of pre-trained features have tied covariance. Although the Mahalanobis distance-based method is claimed to be motivated by classification prediction confidence, we find that its superior performance stems from information not useful for classification. This suggests that the reason the Mahalanobis confidence score works so well is mistaken, and makes use of different information from ODIN, another popular OoD detection method based on prediction confidence. This perspective motivates us to combine these two methods, and the combined detector exhibits improved performance and robustness. These findings provide insight into the behavior of neural classifiers in response to anomalous inputs.",
    "Algorithms like those for differentiating functional expressions manipulate the syntactic structure of mathematical expressions in a mathematically meaningful way. A formalization of such an algorithm should include a specification of its computational behavior, a specification of its mathematical meaning, and a mechanism for applying the algorithm to actual expressions. Achieving these goals requires the ability to integrate reasoning about the syntax of the expressions with reasoning about what the expressions mean. A syntax framework is a mathematical structure that is an abstract model for a syntax reasoning system. It contains a mapping of expressions to syntactic values that represent the syntactic structures of the expressions; a language for reasoning about syntactic values; a quotation mechanism to refer to the syntactic value of an expression; and an evaluation mechanism to refer to the value of the expression represented by a syntactic value. We present and compare two approaches, based on instances of a syntax framework, to formalize a syntax-based mathematical algorithm in a formal theory T. In the first approach the syntactic values for the expressions manipulated by the algorithm are members of an inductive type in T, but quotation and evaluation are functions defined in the metatheory of T. In the second approach every expression in T is represented by a syntactic value, and quotation and evaluation are operators in T itself.",
    "The paper concerns two interacting consumer-resource pairs based on chemostat-like equations under the assumption that the dynamics of the resource is considerably slower than that of the consumer. The presence of two different time scales enables to carry out a fairly complete analysis of the problem. This is done by treating consumers and resources in the coupled system as fast-scale and slow-scale variables respectively and subsequently considering developments in phase planes of these variables, fast and slow, as if they are independent. When uncoupled, each pair has unique asymptotically stable steady state and no self-sustained oscillatory behavior (although damped oscillations about the equilibrium are admitted). When the consumer-resource pairs are weakly coupled through direct reciprocal inhibition of consumers, the whole system exhibits self-sustained relaxation oscillations with a period that can be significantly longer than intrinsic relaxation time of either pair. It is shown that the model equations adequately describe locally linked consumer-resource systems of quite different nature: living populations under interspecific interference competition and lasers coupled via their cavity losses.",
    "Wireless local area networks (WLAN) still suffer from a severe performance discrepancy between different users in the uplink. This is because of the spatially varying channel conditions provided by the wireless medium. Cooperative medium access control (MAC) protocols as for example CoopMAC were proposed to mitigate this problem. In this work, it is shown that cooperation implies for cooperating nodes a tradeoff between throughput and bit-cost, which is the energy needed to transmit one bit. The tradeoff depends on the degree of cooperation. For carrier sense multiple access (CSMA) based networks, the throughput/bit-cost tradeoff curve is theoretically derived. A new distributed CSMA protocol called fairMAC is proposed and it is theoretically shown that fairMAC can asymptotically achieve any operating point on the tradeoff curve when the packet lengths go to infinity. The theoretical results are validated through Monte Carlo simulations.",
    "Social tagging has become an interesting approach to improve search and navigation over the actual Web, since it aggregates the tags added by different users to the same resource in a collaborative way. This way, it results in a list of weighted tags describing its resource. Combined to a classical taxonomic classification system such as that by Wikipedia, social tags can enhance document navigation and search. On the one hand, social tags suggest alternative navigation ways, including pivot-browsing, popularity-driven navigation, and filtering. On the other hand, it provides new metadata, sometimes uncovered by documents' content, that can substantially improve document search. In this work, the inclusion of an interface to add user-defined tags describing Wikipedia articles is proposed, as a way to improve article navigation and retrieval. As a result, a prototype on applying tags over Wikipedia is proposed in order to evaluate its effectiveness.",
    "Quantum Computing and especially Quantum Machine Learning, in a short period of time, has gained a lot of interest through research groups around the world. This can be seen in the increasing number of proposed models for pattern classification applying quantum principles to a certain degree. Despise the increasing volume of models, there is a void in testing these models on real datasets and not only on synthetic ones. The objective of this work is to classify patterns with binary attributes using a quantum classifier. Specially, we show results of a complete quantum classifier applied to image datasets. The experiments show favorable output while dealing with balanced classification problems as well as with imbalanced classes where the minority class is the most relevant. This is promising in medical areas, where usually the important class is also the minority class.",
    "We present near- and mid-infrared observations on the shock-cloud interaction region in the southern part of the supernova remnant HB 21, performed with the InfraRed Camera (IRC) aboard AKARI satellite and the Wide InfraRed Camera (WIRC) at the Palomar 5 m telescope. The IRC 4 um (N4), 7 um (S7), and 11 um (S11) band images and the WIRC H2 v=1->0 S(1) 2.12 um image show similar diffuse features, around a shocked CO cloud. We analyzed the emission through comparison with the H2 line emission of several shock models. The IRC colors are well explained by the thermal admixture model of H2 gas--whose infinitesimal H2 column density has a power-law relation with the temperature $T$, $dN\\sim T^{-b}dT$--with n(H2) $\\sim3.9\\times10^4$ cm^{-2}, $b\\sim4.2$, and N(H2;T>100K) $\\sim2.8\\times10^{21}$ cm^{-2}. We interpreted these parameters with several different pictures of the shock-cloud interactions--multiple planar C-shocks, bow shocks, and shocked clumps--and discuss their weaknesses and strengths. The observed H2 v=1->0 S(1) intensity is four times greater than the prediction from the power-law admixture model, the same tendency as found in the northern part of HB 21 (Paper I). We also explored the limitation of the thermal admixture model with respect to the derived model parameters.",
    "Recently, vision transformers started to show impressive results which outperform large convolution based models significantly. However, in the area of small models for mobile or resource constrained devices, ConvNet still has its own advantages in both performance and model complexity. We propose ParC-Net, a pure ConvNet based backbone model that further strengthens these advantages by fusing the merits of vision transformers into ConvNets. Specifically, we propose position aware circular convolution (ParC), a light-weight convolution op which boasts a global receptive field while producing location sensitive features as in local convolutions. We combine the ParCs and squeeze-exictation ops to form a meta-former like model block, which further has the attention mechanism like transformers. The aforementioned block can be used in plug-and-play manner to replace relevant blocks in ConvNets or transformers. Experiment results show that the proposed ParC-Net achieves better performance than popular light-weight ConvNets and vision transformer based models in common vision tasks and datasets, while having fewer parameters and faster inference speed. For classification on ImageNet-1k, ParC-Net achieves 78.6% top-1 accuracy with about 5.0 million parameters, saving 11% parameters and 13% computational cost but gaining 0.2% higher accuracy and 23% faster inference speed (on ARM based Rockchip RK3288) compared with MobileViT, and uses only 0.5 times parameters but gaining 2.7% accuracy compared with DeIT. On MS-COCO object detection and PASCAL VOC segmentation tasks, ParC-Net also shows better performance. Source code is available at https://github.com/hkzhang91/ParC-Net",
    "From the algebraic solution of $x^{n}-x+t=0$ for $n=2,3,4$ and the corresponding solution in terms of hypergeometric functions, we obtain a set of reduction formulas for hypergeometric functions. By differentiation and integration of these results, and applying other known reduction formulas of hypergeometric functions, we derive new reduction formulas of special functions as well as the calculation of some infinite integrals in terms of elementary functions.",
    "Air-gap covert channels are special types of covert communication channels that enable attackers to exfiltrate data from isolated, network-less computers. Various types of air-gap covert channels have been demonstrated over the years, including electromagnetic, magnetic, acoustic, optical, and thermal. In this paper, we introduce a new type of vibrational (seismic) covert channel. We observe that computers vibrate at a frequency correlated to the rotation speed of their internal fans. These inaudible vibrations affect the entire structure on which the computer is placed. Our method is based on malware's capability of controlling the vibrations generated by a computer, by regulating its internal fan speeds. We show that the malware-generated covert vibrations can be sensed by nearby smartphones via the integrated, sensitive \\textit{accelerometers}. Notably, the accelerometer sensors in smartphones can be accessed by any app without requiring the user permissions, which make this attack highly evasive. We implemented AiR-ViBeR, malware that encodes binary information, and modulate it over a low frequency vibrational carrier. The data is then decoded by malicious application on a smartphone placed on the same surface (e.g., on a desk). We discuss the attack model, provide technical background, and present the implementation details and evaluation results. Our results show that using AiR-ViBeR, data can be exfiltrated from air-gapped computer to a nearby smartphone on the same table, or even an adjacent table, via vibrations. Finally, we propose a set of countermeasures for this new type of attack.",
    "The total cost of a 25 W average load magnetic refrigerator using commercial grade Gd is calculated using a numerical model. The price of magnetocaloric material, magnet material and cost of operation are considered, and all influence the total cost. The lowest combined total cost with a device lifetime of 15 years is found to be in the range \\$150-\\$400 depending on the price of the magnetocaloric and magnet material. The cost of the magnet is largest, followed closely by the cost of operation, while the cost of the magnetocaloric material is almost negligible. For the lowest cost device, the optimal magnetic field is about 1.4 T, the particle size is 0.23 mm, the length of the regenerator is 40-50 mm and the utilization is about 0.2, for all device lifetimes and material and magnet prices, while the operating frequency vary as function of device lifetime. The considered performance characteristics are based on the performance of a conventional A$^{+++}$ refrigeration unit. In a rough life time cost comparison between the magnetic refrigeration device and such a unit we find similar costs, the former being slightly cheaper, assuming the cost of the magnet can be recuperated at end of life.",
    "We prove the existence of initial data sets which possess an asymptotically flat and an asymptotically cylindrical end. Such geometries are known as trumpets in the community of numerical relativists.",
    "Enzymes utilize protein architectures to create highly specialized structural motifs that can greatly enhance the rates of complex chemical transformations. Here we use experiments, combined with ab initio simulations that exactly include nuclear quantum effects, to show that a triad of strongly hydrogen bonded tyrosine residues within the active site of the enzyme ketosteroid isomerase (KSI) facilitates quantum proton delocalization. This delocalization dramatically stabilizes the deprotonation of an active site tyrosine residue, resulting in a very large isotope effect on its acidity. When an intermediate analog is docked, it is incorporated into the hydrogen bond network, giving rise to extended quantum proton delocalization in the active site. These results shed light on the role of nuclear quantum effects in the hydrogen bond network that stabilizes the reactive intermediate of KSI, and the behavior of protons in biological systems containing strong hydrogen bonds.",
    "In this work, we propose ENSEI, a secure inference (SI) framework based on the frequency-domain secure convolution (FDSC) protocol for the efficient execution of privacy-preserving visual recognition. Our observation is that, under the combination of homomorphic encryption and secret sharing, homomorphic convolution can be obliviously carried out in the frequency domain, significantly simplifying the related computations. We provide protocol designs and parameter derivations for number-theoretic transform (NTT) based FDSC. In the experiment, we thoroughly study the accuracy-efficiency trade-offs between time- and frequency-domain homomorphic convolution. With ENSEI, compared to the best known works, we achieve 5--11x online time reduction, up to 33x setup time reduction, and up to 10x reduction in the overall inference time. A further 33% of bandwidth reductions can be obtained on binary neural networks with only 1% of accuracy degradation on the CIFAR-10 dataset.",
    "Recommender systems benefit us in tackling the problem of information overload by predicting our potential choices among diverse niche objects. So far, a variety of personalized recommendation algorithms have been proposed and most of them are based on similarities, such as collaborative filtering and mass diffusion. Here, we propose a novel vertex similarity index named CosRA, which combines advantages of both the cosine index and the resource-allocation (RA) index. By applying the CosRA index to real recommender systems including MovieLens, Netflix and RYM, we show that the CosRA-based method has better performance in accuracy, diversity and novelty than some benchmark methods. Moreover, the CosRA index is free of parameters, which is a significant advantage in real applications. Further experiments show that the introduction of two turnable parameters cannot remarkably improve the overall performance of the CosRA index.",
    "Many real-world applications adopt multi-label data streams as the need for algorithms to deal with rapidly changing data increases. Changes in data distribution, also known as concept drift, cause the existing classification models to rapidly lose their effectiveness. To assist the classifiers, we propose a novel algorithm called Label Dependency Drift Detector (LD3), an implicit (unsupervised) concept drift detector using label dependencies within the data for multi-label data streams. Our study exploits the dynamic temporal dependencies between labels using a label influence ranking method, which leverages a data fusion algorithm and uses the produced ranking to detect concept drift. LD3 is the first unsupervised concept drift detection algorithm in the multi-label classification problem area. In this study, we perform an extensive evaluation of LD3 by comparing it with 14 prevalent supervised concept drift detection algorithms that we adapt to the problem area using 12 datasets and a baseline classifier. The results show that LD3 provides between 19.8\\% and 68.6\\% better predictive performance than comparable detectors on both real-world and synthetic data streams.",
    "The universality of the Cepheid Period-Luminosity relations has been under discussion since metallicity effects have been assumed to play a role in the value of the intercept and, more recently, of the slope of these relations. The goal of the present study is to calibrate the Galactic PL relations in various photometric bands (from B to K) and to compare the results to the well-established PL relations in the LMC. We use a set of 59 calibrating stars, the distances of which are measured using five different distance indicators: Hubble Space Telescope and revised Hipparcos parallaxes, infrared surface brightness and interferometric Baade-Wesselink parallaxes, and classical Zero-Age-Main-Sequence-fitting parallaxes for Cepheids belonging to open clusters or OB stars associations. A detailed discussion of absorption corrections and projection factor to be used is given. We find no significant difference in the slopes of the PL relations between LMC and our Galaxy. We conclude that the Cepheid PL relations have universal slopes in all photometric bands, not depending on the galaxy under study (at least for LMC and Milky Way). The possible zero-point variation with metal content is not discussed in the present work, but an upper limit of 18.50 for the LMC distance modulus can be deduced from our data.",
    "Ensembling methods are well known for improving prediction accuracy. However, they are limited in the sense that they cannot discriminate among component models effectively. In this paper, we propose stacking with auxiliary features that learns to fuse relevant information from multiple systems to improve performance. Auxiliary features enable the stacker to rely on systems that not just agree on an output but also the provenance of the output. We demonstrate our approach on three very different and difficult problems -- the Cold Start Slot Filling, the Tri-lingual Entity Discovery and Linking and the ImageNet object detection tasks. We obtain new state-of-the-art results on the first two tasks and substantial improvements on the detection task, thus verifying the power and generality of our approach.",
    "We present a simple and fast method to simulate spin-torque driven magnetisation dynamics in nano-pillar spin-valve structures. The approach is based on the coupling between a spin transport code based on random matrix theory and a micromagnetics finite-elements software. In this way the spatial dependence of both spin transport and magnetisation dynamics is properly taken into account. Our results are compared with experiments. The excitation of the spin-wave modes, in- cluding the threshold current for steady state magnetisation precession and the nonlinear frequency shift of the modes are reproduced correctly. The giant magneto resistance effect and the magnetisa- tion switching also agree with experiment. The similarities with recently described spin-caloritronics devices are also discussed.",
    "We present a simple framework to compute hyperbolic Voronoi diagrams of finite point sets as affine diagrams. We prove that bisectors in Klein's non-conformal disk model are hyperplanes that can be interpreted as power bisectors of Euclidean balls. Therefore our method simply consists in computing an equivalent clipped power diagram followed by a mapping transformation depending on the selected representation of the hyperbolic space (e.g., Poincar\\'e conformal disk or upper-plane representations). We discuss on extensions of this approach to weighted and $k$-order diagrams, and describe their dual triangulations. Finally, we consider two useful primitives on the hyperbolic Voronoi diagrams for designing tailored user interfaces of an image catalog browsing application in the hyperbolic disk: (1) finding nearest neighbors, and (2) computing smallest enclosing balls.",
    "The problem of diffusive bond-dissociation in a double well potential under application of an external force is scrutinized. We compute the probability distribution of rupture forces and present a detailed discussion of the influence of finite rebinding probabilities on the dynamic force spectrum. In particular, we focus on barrier crossing upon extension, i.e. under linearly increased load, and upon relaxation starting from completely separated bonds. For large loading rates the rupture force and the rejoining force depend on the loading rate in the expected manner determined by the shape of the potential. For small loading rates the mean forces obtained from pull and relax modes approach each other as the system reaches equilibrium. We investigate the dependence of the rupture force distributions and mean rupture forces on external parameters like cantilever stiffness and influence of a soft linker. We find that depending on the implementation of a soft linker the equilibrium rupture force is either unaffected by the presence of the linker or changes in a predictable way with the linker-compliance. Additionally, we show that it is possible to extract the equilibrium constant of the on- and off-rates from the determination of the equilibrium rupture forces.",
    "We propose an invariant feature space for the detection of viscous dominated and turbulent regions (i.e., boundary layers and wakes). The developed methodology uses the principal invariants of the strain and rotational rate tensors as input to an unsupervised Machine Learning Gaussian mixture model. The selected feature space is independent of the coordinate frame used to generate the processed data, as it relies on the principal invariants of strain and rotational rate, which are Galilean invariants. This methodology allows us to identify two distinct flow regions: a viscous dominated, rotational region (boundary layer and wake region) and an inviscid, irrotational region (outer flow region). We test the methodology on a laminar and a turbulent (using Large Eddy Simulation) case for flows past a circular cylinder at $Re=40$ and $Re=3900$. The simulations have been conducted using a high-order nodal Discontinuous Galerkin Spectral Element Method (DGSEM). The results obtained are analysed to show that Gaussian mixture clustering provides an effective identification method of viscous dominated and rotational regions in the flow. We also include comparisons with traditional sensors to show that the proposed clustering does not depend on the selection of an arbitrary threshold, as required when using traditional sensors.",
    "Engineered quantum systems allow us to observe phenomena that are not easily accessible naturally. The LEGO-like nature of superconducting circuits makes them particularly suited for building and coupling artificial atoms. Here, we introduce an artificial molecule, composed of two strongly coupled fluxonium atoms, which possesses a tunable magnetic moment. Using an applied external flux, one can tune the molecule between two regimes: one in which the ground-excited state manifold has a magnetic dipole moment and one in which the ground-excited state manifold has only a magnetic quadrupole moment. By varying the applied external flux, we find the coherence of the molecule to be limited by local flux noise. The ability to engineer and control artificial molecules paves the way for building more complex circuits for protected qubits and quantum simulation.",
    "We describe a method for time-critical decision making involving sequential tasks and stochastic processes. The method employs several iterative refinement routines for solving different aspects of the decision making problem. This paper concentrates on the meta-level control problem of deliberation scheduling, allocating computational resources to these routines. We provide different models corresponding to optimization problems that capture the different circumstances and computational strategies for decision making under time constraints. We consider precursor models in which all decision making is performed prior to execution and recurrent models in which decision making is performed in parallel with execution, accounting for the states observed during execution and anticipating future states. We describe algorithms for precursor and recurrent models and provide the results of our empirical investigations to date.",
    "The role model strategy is introduced as a method for designing an estimator by approaching the output of a superior estimator that has better input observations. This strategy is shown to yield the optimal Bayesian estimator when a Markov condition is fulfilled. Two examples involving simple channels are given to illustrate its use. The strategy is combined with time averaging to construct a statistical model by numerically solving a convex program. The role model strategy was developed in the context of low complexity decoder design for iterative decoding. Potential applications outside the field of communications are discussed.",
    "Computer vision systems currently lack the ability to reliably recognize artistically rendered objects, especially when such data is limited. In this paper, we propose a method for recognizing objects in artistic modalities (such as paintings, cartoons, or sketches), without requiring any labeled data from those modalities. Our method explicitly accounts for stylistic domain shifts between and within domains. To do so, we introduce a complementary training modality constructed to be similar in artistic style to the target domain, and enforce that the network learns features that are invariant between the two training modalities. We show how such artificial labeled source domains can be generated automatically through the use of style transfer techniques, using diverse target images to represent the style in the target domain. Unlike existing methods which require a large amount of unlabeled target data, our method can work with as few as ten unlabeled images. We evaluate it on a number of cross-domain object and scene classification tasks and on a new dataset we release. Our experiments show that our approach, though conceptually simple, significantly improves the accuracy that existing domain adaptation techniques obtain for artistic object recognition.",
    "This paper studies the large time behavior of solutions to semi-linear Cauchy problems with quadratic nonlinearity in gradients. The Cauchy problem considered has a general state space and may degenerate on the boundary of the state space. Two types of large time behavior are obtained: i) pointwise convergence of the solution and its gradient; ii) convergence of solutions to associated backward stochastic differential equations. When the state space is R^d or the space of positive definite matrices, both types of convergence are obtained under growth conditions on model coefficients. These large time convergence results have direct applications in risk sensitive control and long term portfolio choice problems.",
    "The decaying vacuum model (DV), treating dark energy as a varying vacuum, has been studied well recently. The vacuum energy decays linearly with the Hubble parameter in the late-times, $\\rho_\\Lambda(t) \\propto H(t)$, and produces the additional matter component. We constrain the parameters of the DV model using the recent data-sets from supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, baryon acoustic oscillations, CMB, the Hubble rate and x-rays in galaxy clusters. It is found that the best fit of matter density contrast $\\Omega_m$ in the DV model is much lager than that in $\\Lambda$CDM model. We give the confidence contours in the $\\Omega_m-h$ plane up to $3\\sigma$ confidence level. Besides, the normalized likelihoods of $\\Omega_m$ and $h$ are presented, respectively. %",
    "Perpendicular MgO-based Magnetic Tunnel Junctions are optimal candidates as building block of Spin Transfer Torque (STT) magnetoresistive memories. However, up to now, the only STT is not enough to achieve switching current density below 106 A/cm2. A recent work [Wang et al., Nature Mater., vol. 11, pp 64-68, Jan. 2012] has experimentally demonstrated the possibility to perform magnetization switching assisted by an electric-field at ultra-low current density. Theoretically, this switching has been studied by using a macrospin approach only. Here, we show a full micromagnetic study. We found that the switching occurs via a complex nucleation process including the nucleation of magnetic vortexes.",
    "We present a generalisation of Rosenblatt's traditional perceptron learning algorithm to the class of proximal activation functions and demonstrate how this generalisation can be interpreted as an incremental gradient method applied to a novel energy function. This novel energy function is based on a generalised Bregman distance, for which the gradient with respect to the weights and biases does not require the differentiation of the activation function. The interpretation as an energy minimisation algorithm paves the way for many new algorithms, of which we explore a novel variant of the iterative soft-thresholding algorithm for the learning of sparse perceptrons.",
    "The radiation force exerted on an object by an acoustic wave is a widely studied phenomenon since the early work of Rayleigh, Langevin and Brillouin and has led in the last decade to tremendous developments for acoustic micromanipulation. Despite extensive work on this phenomenon, the expressions of the acoustic radiation force applied on a particle have so far been derived only for a steady particle, hence neglecting the effect of its displacement on the radiated wave. In this work we study the acoustic radiation force exerted on a monopolar source translating at a constant velocity small compared to the sound speed. We demonstrate that the asymmetry of the emitted field resulting from Doppler effect induces a radiation force on the source opposite to its motion.",
    "Modelling the base of the solar convective envelope is a tedious problem. Since the first rotation inversions, solar modellers are confronted with the fact that a region of very limited extent has an enormous physical impact on the Sun. Indeed, it is the transition region from differential to solid body rotation, the tachocline, which furthermore is influenced by turbulence and is also supposed to be the seat of the solar magnetic dynamo. Moreover, solar models show significant disagreement with the sound speed profile in this region. In this paper, we show how helioseismology can provide further constraints on this region by carrying out an inversion of the Ledoux discriminant. We compare these inversions for Standard Solar Models built using various opacity tables and chemical abundances and discuss the origins of the discrepancies between Solar Models and the Sun.",
    "There is a clear desire to model and comprehend human behavior. Trends in research covering this topic show a clear assumption that many view human reasoning as the presupposed standard in artificial reasoning. As such, topics such as game theory, theory of mind, machine learning, etc. all integrate concepts which are assumed components of human reasoning. These serve as techniques to attempt to both replicate and understand the behaviors of humans. In addition, next generation autonomous and adaptive systems will largely include AI agents and humans working together as teams. To make this possible, autonomous agents will require the ability to embed practical models of human behavior, which allow them not only to replicate human models as a technique to \"learn\", but to to understand the actions of users and anticipate their behavior, so as to truly operate in symbiosis with them. The main objective of this paper it to provide a succinct yet systematic review of the most important approaches in two areas dealing with quantitative models of human behaviors. Specifically, we focus on (i) techniques which learn a model or policy of behavior through exploration and feedback, such as Reinforcement Learning, and (ii) directly model mechanisms of human reasoning, such as beliefs and bias, without going necessarily learning via trial-and-error.",
    "Breaking down botnets have always been a big challenge. The robustness of C&C channels is increased, and the detection of botmaster is harder in P2P botnets. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic method to reconstruct the topologies of the C&C channel for P2P botnets. Due to the geographic dispersion of P2P botnet members, it is not possible to supervise all members, and there does not exist all necessary data for applying other graph reconstruction methods. So far, no general method has been introduced to reconstruct C&C channel topology for all type of P2P botnet. In our method, the probability of connections between bots is estimated by using the inaccurate receiving times of several cascades, network model parameters of C&C channel, and end-to-end delay distribution of the Internet. The receiving times can be collected by observing the external reaction of bots to commands. The results of our simulations show that more than 90% of the edges in a 1000-member network with node degree mean 50, have been accurately estimated by collecting the inaccurate receiving times of 22 cascades. In case the receiving times of just half of the bots are collected, this accuracy of estimation is obtained by using 95 cascades.",
    "In grand unified theories (GUT), non-universal boundary conditions for the gaugino masses may arise at the unification scale, and affect the observability of the neutral MSSM Higgs bosons (h/H/A) at the LHC. The implications of such non-universal gaugino masses are investigated for the Higgs boson production in the SUSY cascade decay chain gluino --> squark quark, squark --> neutralino_2 quark, neutralino_2 --> neutralino_1 h/H/A, h/H/A --> b b-bar produced in pp interactions. In the singlet representation with universal gaugino masses only the light Higgs boson can be produced in this cascade with the parameter region of interest for us, while with non-universal gaugino masses heavy neutral MSSM Higgs boson production may dominate. The allowed parameter space in the light of the WMAP constraints on the cold dark matter relic density is investigated in the above scenarios for gaugino mass parameters. We also demonstrate that combination of representations can give the required amount of dark matter in any point of the parameter space. In the non-universal case we show that heavy Higgs bosons can be detected in the studied cascade in parameter regions with the WMAP preferred neutralino relic density.",
    "Subwavelength modulators play an indispensable role in integrated photonic-electronic circuits. Due to weak light-matter interactions, it is always a challenge to develop a modulator with a nanometer scale footprint, low switching energy, low insertion loss and large modulation depth. In this paper, we propose the design of a vanadium dioxide dual-mode plasmonic waveguide electroabsorption modulator using a metal-insulator-VO$_2$-insulator-metal (MIVIM) waveguide platform. By varying the index of vanadium dioxide, the modulator can route plasmonic waves through the low-loss dielectric insulator layer during the \"on\" state and high-loss VO$_2$ layer during the \"off\" state, thereby significantly reducing the insertion loss while maintaining a large modulation depth. This ultracompact waveguide modulator, for example, can achieve a large modulation depth of ~10dB with an active size of only 200x50x220nm$^3$ (or ~{\\lambda}$^3$/1700), requiring a drive-voltage of ~4.6V. This high performance plasmonic modulator could potentially be one of the keys towards fully-integrated plasmonic nanocircuits in the next-generation chip technology.",
    "As a car becomes more connected, a countermeasure against automobile theft has become a significant task in the real world. To respond to automobile theft, data mining, biometrics, and additional authentication methods are proposed. Among current countermeasures, data mining method is one of the efficient ways to capture the owner driver's unique characteristics. To identify the owner driver from thieves, previous works applied various algorithms toward driving data. Such data mining methods utilized supervised learning, thus required labeled data set. However, it is unrealistic to gather and apply the thief's driving pattern. To overcome this problem, we propose driver identification method with GAN. GAN has merit to build identification model by learning the owner driver's data only. We trained GAN only with owner driver's data and used trained discriminator to identify the owner driver. From actual driving data, we evaluated our identification model recognizes the owner driver well. By ensembling various driver authentication methods with the proposed model, we expect industry can develop automobile theft countermeasures available in the real world.",
    "Slow oscillations (SlO) of magnetoresistance is a convenient tool to measure electronic structure parameters in quasi-two-dimensional metals. We study the possibility to apply this method to multi-band conductors, e.g. to iron-based high-temperature superconducting materials. We show that SlO can be used to measure the interlayer transfer integral in multi-band conductors similar to single-band metals. In addition, the SlO allow to measure and compare the effective masses or the electron scattering rates in various bands.",

    "This paper proposes a speech emotion recognition method based on speech features and speech transcriptions (text). Speech features such as Spectrogram and Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) help retain emotion-related low-level characteristics in speech whereas text helps capture semantic meaning, both of which help in different aspects of emotion detection. We experimented with several Deep Neural Network (DNN) architectures, which take in different combinations of speech features and text as inputs. The proposed network architectures achieve higher accuracies when compared to state-of-the-art methods on a benchmark dataset. The combined MFCC-Text Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model proved to be the most accurate in recognizing emotions in IEMOCAP data.",
    "In this paper, we introduce variational semantic memory into meta-learning to acquire long-term knowledge for few-shot learning. The variational semantic memory accrues and stores semantic information for the probabilistic inference of class prototypes in a hierarchical Bayesian framework. The semantic memory is grown from scratch and gradually consolidated by absorbing information from tasks it experiences. By doing so, it is able to accumulate long-term, general knowledge that enables it to learn new concepts of objects. We formulate memory recall as the variational inference of a latent memory variable from addressed contents, which offers a principled way to adapt the knowledge to individual tasks. Our variational semantic memory, as a new long-term memory module, confers principled recall and update mechanisms that enable semantic information to be efficiently accrued and adapted for few-shot learning. Experiments demonstrate that the probabilistic modelling of prototypes achieves a more informative representation of object classes compared to deterministic vectors. The consistent new state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks shows the benefit of variational semantic memory in boosting few-shot recognition.",
    "The relativistic four-quark equations with the open-charm and the open-strange are found in the framework of coupled-channel formalism. The dynamical mixing of the meson-meson states with the four-quark states is considered. The four-quark amplitudes including the quarks of four flavors (u, d, s, c) are constructed. The poles of these amplitudes determine the masses of tetraquarks. The mass values of the tetraquarks with the spin-parity JP=1-,2- are calculated.",
    "The Fisher Matrix is the backbone of modern cosmological forecasting. We describe the Fisher4Cast software: a general-purpose, easy-to-use, Fisher Matrix framework. It is open source, rigorously designed and tested and includes a Graphical User Interface (GUI) with automated LATEX file creation capability and point-and-click Fisher ellipse generation. Fisher4Cast was designed for ease of extension and, although written in Matlab, is easily portable to open-source alternatives such as Octave and Scilab. Here we use Fisher4Cast to present new 3-D and 4-D visualisations of the forecasting landscape and to investigate the effects of growth and curvature on future cosmological surveys. Early releases have been available at http://www.cosmology.org.za since May 2008 with 750 downloads in the first year. Version 2.2 is made public with this paper and includes a Quick Start guide and the code used to produce the figures in this paper, in the hope that it will be useful to the cosmology and wider scientific communities.",
    "The representation of knowledge based on first-order logic captures the richness of natural language and supports multiple probabilistic inference models. Although symbolic representation enables quantitative reasoning with statistical probability, it is difficult to utilize with machine learning models as they perform numerical operations. In contrast, knowledge embedding (i.e., high-dimensional and continuous vectors) is a feasible approach to complex reasoning that can not only retain the semantic information of knowledge but also establish the quantifiable relationship among them. In this paper, we propose recursive neural knowledge network (RNKN), which combines medical knowledge based on first-order logic with recursive neural network for multi-disease diagnosis. After RNKN is efficiently trained from manually annotated Chinese Electronic Medical Records (CEMRs), diagnosis-oriented knowledge embeddings and weight matrixes are learned. Experimental results verify that the diagnostic accuracy of RNKN is superior to that of some classical machine learning models and Markov logic network (MLN). The results also demonstrate that the more explicit the evidence extracted from CEMRs is, the better is the performance achieved. RNKN gradually exhibits the interpretation of knowledge embeddings as the number of training epochs increases.",
    "Several solenoids are usually installed in electron cooler device to guide the motion of the electron beam in the cooler. However, the solenoids also have influence to the ion beam in the cooler storage ring. The transverse motion of the ion beam in storage ring will become coupled, if the solenoids installed in the electron cooler are not compensated perfectly. In this paper, the coupled transverse motion due to the uncompensated cooler's solenoids of CSRm (The main storage ring in the IMP, Lan Zhou, China) is studied, and the coupled beam envelopes are calculated by a new method.",
    "A near-infrared excess is detected at the white dwarf PHL5038 in UKIDSS photometry, consistent with the presence of a cool, substellar companion. We have obtained H- and K-grism spectra and images of PHL5038 using NIRI on Gemini North. The target is spatially and spectrally resolved into two components; an 8000K DA white dwarf, and a likely L8 brown dwarf companion, separated by 0.94\". The spectral type of the secondary was determined using standard spectral indices for late L and T dwarfs. The projected orbital separation of the binary is 55AU, and so it becomes only the second known wide WD+dL binary to be found after GD165AB. This object could potentially be used as a benchmark for testing substellar evolutionary models at intermediate to older ages.",
    "We investigate the impact of dynamical streams and substructure on estimates of the local escape speed and total mass of Milky Way-mass galaxies from modelling the high velocity tail of local halo stars. We use a suite of high-resolution, magneto-hydrodynamical cosmological zoom-in simulations, which resolve phase space substructure in local volumes around solar-like positions. We show that phase space structure varies significantly between positions in individual galaxies and across the suite. Substructure populates the high velocity tail unevenly and leads to discrepancies in the mass estimates. We show that a combination of streams, sample noise and truncation of the high velocity tail below the escape speed leads to a distribution of mass estimates with a median that falls below the true value by $\\sim 20 \\%$, and a spread of a factor of 2 across the suite. Correcting for these biases, we derive a revised value for the Milky Way mass presented in Deason et al. of $1.29 ^{+0.37}_{-0.47} \\times 10^{12}$ $\\rm M_{\\odot}$.",
    "Using no conventional measurements in position space, information extraction rates exceeding one bit per photon are achieved by employing high-dimensional correlated orbital angular momentum (OAM) states for object recognition. The correlations are shown to be insensitive to axial rotation of the target object: the information structure of an object's joint OAM coincidence spectrum is unchanged even when the object undergoes random rotations between each measurement. Additionally, OAM correlations alone are shown to be sufficient for full image reconstruction of complex, off-axis objects, and novel object symmetries are observed in the phases of OAM-object interaction transition amplitudes. Variations in mutual information rates, due to off-axis translation in the beam field, are studied, and it is shown that object symmetry signatures and information rates are independent of environmental factors sufficiently far from the beam center. The results motivate dynamic scanning applications in contexts where symmetry and small numbers of noninvasive measurements are desired.",
    "During Parker Solar Probe's first two orbits there are widespread observations of rapid magnetic field reversals known as switchbacks. These switchbacks are extensively found in the near-Sun solar wind, appear to occur in patches, and have possible links to various phenomena such as magnetic reconnection near the solar surface. As switchbacks are associated with faster plasma flows, we questioned whether they are hotter than the background plasma and whether the microphysics inside a switchback is different to its surroundings. We have studied the reduced distribution functions from the Solar Probe Cup instrument and considered time periods with markedly large angular deflections, to compare parallel temperatures inside and outside switchbacks. We have shown that the reduced distribution functions inside switchbacks are consistent with a rigid phase space rotation of the background plasma. As such, we conclude that the proton core parallel temperature is the same inside and outside of switchbacks, implying that a T-V relationship does not hold for the proton core parallel temperature inside magnetic field switchbacks. We further conclude that switchbacks are consistent with Alfv\\'enic pulses travelling along open magnetic field lines. The origin of these pulses, however, remains unknown. We also found that there is no obvious link between radial Poynting flux and kinetic energy enhancements suggesting that the radial Poynting flux is not important for the dynamics of switchbacks.",
    "Under the Nainital-Cape Survey, eight $\\delta\\,$Scuti type pulsators have been discovered with the pulsation periods in the range of several minutes to few hours. In order to understand these observed pulsational variabilities, we have performed non-adiabatic linear stability analyses in models of these stars having mass in the range of 1 to 3 M$_{\\odot}$. Several low order p-modes are found to be unstable where the pulsation periods associated with these unstable modes are in good agreement with the observed periods. Particularly for HD$\\,$118660, HD$\\,$113878, HD$\\,$102480, HD$\\,$98851, and HD$\\,$25515, we demonstrate that the observed variabilities can be explained with the low order radial p-mode pulsations.",
    "A new perspective on the classical mechanical formulation of particle trajectories in lorentz-violating theories is presented. Using the extended hamiltonian formalism, a Legendre Transformation between the associated covariant Lagrangian and Hamiltonian varieties is constructed. This approach enables calculation of trajectories using hamilton's equations in momentum space and the Euler-Lagrange equations in velocity space away from certain singular points that arise in the theory. Singular points are naturally de-singularized by requiring the trajectories to be smooth functions of both velocity and momentum variables. In addition, it is possible to identify specific sheets of the dispersion relations that correspond to specific solutions for the lagrangian. Examples corresponding to bipartite Finsler functions are computed in detail. A direct connection between the lagrangians and the field-theoretic solutions to the Dirac equation is also established for a special case.",
    "Spectrum management has been identified as a crucial step towards enabling the technology of a cognitive radio network (CRN). Most of the current works dealing with spectrum management in the CRN focus on a single task of the problem, e.g., spectrum sensing, spectrum decision, spectrum sharing or spectrum mobility. In this two-part paper, we argue that for certain network configurations, jointly performing several tasks of the spectrum management improves the spectrum efficiency. Specifically, our aim is to study the uplink resource management problem in a CRN where there exist multiple cognitive users (CUs) and access points (APs). The CUs, in order to maximize their uplink transmission rates, have to associate to a suitable AP (spectrum decision), and to share the channels used by this AP with other CUs (spectrum sharing). These tasks are clearly interdependent, and the problem of how they should be carried out efficiently and in a distributed manner is still open in the literature.",
    "A simple, exactly solvable statistical model is presented for the description of baryonic matter in the thermodynamic conditions associated to the evolution of core-collapsing supernova. It is shown that the model presents a first order phase transition in the grandcanonical ensemble which is not observed in the canonical ensemble. Similar to other model systems studied in condensed matter physics, this ensemble in-equivalence is accompanied by negative susceptibility and discontinuities in the intensive observables conjugated to the order parameter. This peculiar behavior originates from the fact that baryonic matter is subject to attractive short range strong forces as well as repulsive long range electromagnetic interactions, partially screened by a background of electrons. As such, it is expected in any theoretical treatment of nuclear matter in the stellar environment. Consequences for the phenomenology of supernova dynamics are drawn.",
    "To meet requirements of high performance THz-FEL (Free Electron Laser), a compact scheme of FEL injector was proposed. Thermionic cathode was chosen to emit electrons instead of photo-cathode with complex structure and high cost. The effective bunch charge was improved to ~200pC by adopting enhanced EC-ITC (External Cathode Independently Tunable Cells) RF gun to extract micro-bunches, and back bombardment effects were almost eliminated as well. Constant gradient accelerator structures were designed to improve energy to ~14MeV, while focusing system was applied for emittance suppressing and bunch state maintenance. Physical design and beam dynamics of key components for FEL injector were analyzed. Furthermore, start-to-end simulations with multi-pulses were performed by using homemade MATLAB and Parmela. The results show that continual high brightness electron bunches with low energy spread and emittance could be obtained stably.",
    "Several claims have been made of anomalies in the large-angle properties of the cosmic microwave background anisotropy as measured by WMAP. In most cases, the statistical significance of these anomalies is hard or even impossible to assess, due to the fact that the statistics used to quantify the anomalies were chosen a posteriori. On the other hand, the possibility of detecting new physics on the largest observable scales is so exciting that, in my opinion, it is worthwhile to examine the claims carefully. I will focus on three particular claims: the lack of large-angle power, the north-south power asymmetry, and multipole alignments. In all cases, the problem of a posteriori statistics can best be solved by finding a new data set that probes similar physical scales to the large-angle CMB. This is a difficult task, but there are some possible routes to achieving it.",
    "Multi-photon states can be produced in multiple parametric down conversion (PDC) processes. The nonlinear crystal in such a case is pumped with high power. In theory, the more populated these states are, the deeper is the conflict with local realistic description. However, the interference contrast in multi-photon PDC experiments can be quite low for high pumping. We show how the contrast can be improved. The idea employs currently accessible optical devices, the multiport beam splitters. They are capable of splitting the incoming light in one input mode to $M$ output modes. Our scheme works as a POVM filter. It may provide a feasible CHSH-Bell inequality test, and thus can be useful in e.g. schemes reducing communication complexity.",
    "The spectrum of exponents of the transfer matrix provides the localization lengths of Anderson's model for a particle in a lattice with disordered potential. I show that a duality identity for determinants and Jensen's identity for subharmonic functions, give a formula for the spectrum in terms of eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian with non-Hermitian boundary conditions. The formula is exact; it involves an average over a Bloch phase, rather than disorder. A preliminary investigation of non-Hermitian spectra of Anderson's model in D=1,2 and on the smallest exponent is presented.",
    "In this article, we improve extreme learning machines for regression tasks using a graph signal processing based regularization. We assume that the target signal for prediction or regression is a graph signal. With this assumption, we use the regularization to enforce that the output of an extreme learning machine is smooth over a given graph. Simulation results with real data confirm that such regularization helps significantly when the available training data is limited in size and corrupted by noise.",
    "To properly describe heating in weakly collisional turbulent plasmas such as the solar wind, inter-particle collisions should be taken into account. Collisions can convert ordered energy into heat by means of irreversible relaxation towards the thermal equilibrium. Recently, Pezzi et al. (Phys. Rev. Lett., vol. 116, 2016, p. 145001) showed that the plasma collisionality is enhanced by the presence of fine structures in velocity space. Here, the analysis is extended by directly comparing the effects of the fully nonlinear Landau operator and a linearized Landau operator. By focusing on the relaxation towards the equilibrium of an out of equilibrium distribution function in a homogeneous force-free plasma, here it is pointed out that it is significant to retain nonlinearities in the collisional operator to quantify the importance of collisional effects. Although the presence of several characteristic times associated with the dissipation of different phase space structures is recovered in both the cases of the nonlinear and the linearized operators, the influence of these times is different in the two cases. In the linearized operator case, the recovered characteristic times are systematically larger than in the fully nonlinear operator case, this suggesting that fine velocity structures are dissipated slower if nonlinearities are neglected in the collisional operator.",
    "In this research work, we have demonstrated the application of Mask-RCNN (Regional Convolutional Neural Network), a deep-learning algorithm for computer vision and specifically object detection, to semiconductor defect inspection domain. Stochastic defect detection and classification during semiconductor manufacturing has grown to be a challenging task as we continuously shrink circuit pattern dimensions (e.g., for pitches less than 32 nm). Defect inspection and analysis by state-of-the-art optical and e-beam inspection tools is generally driven by some rule-based techniques, which in turn often causes to misclassification and thereby necessitating human expert intervention. In this work, we have revisited and extended our previous deep learning-based defect classification and detection method towards improved defect instance segmentation in SEM images with precise extent of defect as well as generating a mask for each defect category/instance. This also enables to extract and calibrate each segmented mask and quantify the pixels that make up each mask, which in turn enables us to count each categorical defect instances as well as to calculate the surface area in terms of pixels. We are aiming at detecting and segmenting different types of inter-class stochastic defect patterns such as bridge, break, and line collapse as well as to differentiate accurately between intra-class multi-categorical defect bridge scenarios (as thin/single/multi-line/horizontal/non-horizontal) for aggressive pitches as well as thin resists (High NA applications). Our proposed approach demonstrates its effectiveness both quantitatively and qualitatively.",
    "We give a new bound on the parameter $\\lambda$ (number of common neighbors of a pair of adjacent vertices) in a distance-regular graph $G$, improving and generalizing bounds for strongly regular graphs by Spielman (1996) and Pyber (2014). The new bound is one of the ingredients of recent progress on the complexity of testing isomorphism of strongly regular graphs (Babai, Chen, Sun, Teng, Wilmes 2013). The proof is based on a clique geometry found by Metsch (1991) under certain constraints on the parameters. We also give a simplified proof of the following asymptotic consequence of Metsch's result: if $k\\mu = o(\\lambda^2)$ then each edge of $G$ belongs to a unique maximal clique of size asymptotically equal to $\\lambda$, and all other cliques have size $o(\\lambda)$. Here $k$ denotes the degree and $\\mu$ the number of common neighbors of a pair of vertices at distance 2. We point out that Metsch's cliques are \"asymptotically Delsarte\" when $k\\mu = o(\\lambda^2)$, so families of distance-regular graphs with parameters satisfying $k\\mu = o(\\lambda^2)$ are \"asymptotically Delsarte-geometric.\"",
    "Recent galaxy observations show that star formation activity changes depending on galactic environments. In order to understand the diversity of galactic-scale star formation, it is crucial to understand the formation and evolution of giant molecular clouds in an extreme environment. We focus on observational evidence that bars in strongly barred galaxies lack massive stars even though quantities of molecular gas are sufficient to form stars. In this paper, we present a hydrodynamical simulation of a strongly barred galaxy, using a stellar potential which is taken from observational results of NGC1300, and we compare cloud properties between different galactic environments: bar, bar-end and spiral arms. We find that the mean of cloud's virial parameter is ~1 and that there is no environmental dependence, indicating that the gravitationally-bound state of a cloud is not behind the observational evidence of the lack of massive stars in strong bars. Instead, we focus on cloud-cloud collisions, which have been proposed as a triggering mechanism for massive star formation. We find that the collision speed in the bar is faster than those in the other regions. We examine the collision frequency using clouds' kinematics and conclude that the fast collisions in the bar could originate from random-like motion of clouds due to elliptical gas orbits shifted by the bar potential. These results suggest that the observed regions of lack of active star-formation in the strong bar originate from the fast cloud-cloud collisions, which are inefficient in forming massive stars, due to the galactic-scale violent gas motion.",
    "Context: The mass-metallicity relationship (MMR) of star-forming galaxies is well-established, however there is still some disagreement with respect to its exact shape and its possible dependence on other observables. Aims: We measure the MMR in the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey. We compare our measured MMR to that measured in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and study the dependence of the MMR on various selection criteria to identify potential causes for disparities seen in the literature. Methods: We use strong emission line ratio diagnostics to derive oxygen abundances. We then apply a range of selection criteria for the minimum signal-to-noise in various emission lines, as well as the apparent and absolute magnitude to study variations in the inferred MMR. Results: The shape and position of the MMR can differ significantly depending on the metallicity calibration and selection used. After selecting a robust metallicity calibration amongst those tested, we find that the mass-metallicity relation for redshifts 0.061< z<0.35 in GAMA is in reasonable agreement with that found in the SDSS despite the difference in the luminosity range probed. Conclusions: In view of the significant variations of the MMR brought about by reasonable changes in the sample selection criteria and method, we recommend that care be taken when comparing the MMR from different surveys and studies directly. We also conclude that there could be a modest level of evolution over 0.06<z<0.35 within the GAMA sample.",
    "Based on thermodynamic considerations we derive a set of equations relating the seepage velocities of the fluid components in immiscible and incompressible two-phase flow in porous media. They necessitate the introduction of a new velocity function, the co-moving velocity. This velocity function is a characteristic of the porous medium. Together with a constitutive relation between the velocities and the driving forces, such as the pressure gradient, these equations form a closed set. We solve four versions of the capillary tube model analytically using this theory. We test the theory numerically on a network model.",
    "Nature's spectacular inventiveness, reflected in the enormous diversity of form and function displayed by the biosphere, is a feature of life that distinguishes living most strongly from nonliving. It is, therefore, not surprising that this aspect of life should become a central focus of artificial life. We have known since Darwin that the diversity is produced dynamically, through the process of evolution; this has led life's creative productivity to be called Open-Ended Evolution (OEE) in the field. This article introduces the second of two special issues on current research in OEE and provides an overview of the contents of both special issues. Most of the work was presented at a workshop on open-ended evolution that was held as a part of the 2018 Conference on Artificial Life in Tokyo, and much of it had antecedents in two previous workshops on open-ended evolution at artificial life conferences in Cancun and York. We present a simplified categorization of OEE and summarize progress in the field as represented by the articles in this special issue.",
    "The properties of MgO/Ag(001) ultrathin films with substitutional Mg atoms in the interface metal layer have been investigated by means of Auger electron diffraction experiments, ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Exploiting the layer-by-layer resolution of the Mg KL_23 L_23 Auger spectra and using multiple scattering calculations, we first determine the interlayer distances as well as the morphological parameters of the MgO/Ag(001) system with and without Mg atoms incorporated at the interface. We find that the Mg atoms incorporation drives a strong distortion of the interface layers and that its impact on the metal/oxide electronic structure is an important reduction of the work function (0.5 eV) related to band-offset variations at the interface. These experimental observations are in very good agreement with our DFT calculations which reproduce the induced lattice distortion and which reveal (through a Bader analysis) that the increase of the interface Mg concentration results in an electron transfer from Mg to Ag atoms of the metallic interface layer. Although the local lattice distortion appears as a consequence of the attractive (repulsive) Coulomb interaction between O2- ions of the MgO interface layer and the nearest positively (negatively) charged Mg (Ag) neighbors of the metallic interface layer, its effect on the work function reduction is only limited. Finally, an analysis of the induced work function changes in terms of charge transfer, rumpling, and electrostatic compression contributions is attempted and reveals that the metal/oxide work function changes induced by interface Mg atoms incorporation are essentially driven by the increase of the electrostatic compression effect.",
    "The need to monitor industrial processes, detecting changes in process parameters in order to promptly correct problems that may arise, generates a particular area of interest. This is particularly critical and complex when the measured value falls below the sensitivity limits of the measuring system or below detection limits, causing much of their observations are incomplete. Such observations to be called incomplete observations or left censored data. With a high level of censorship, for example greater than 70%, the application of traditional methods for monitoring processes is not appropriate. It is required to use appropriate data analysis statistical techniques, to assess the actual state of the process at any time. This paper proposes a way to estimate process parameters in such cases and presents the corresponding control chart, from an algorithm that is also presented.",
    "Clustering is central to many data-driven application domains and has been studied extensively in terms of distance functions and grouping algorithms. Relatively little work has focused on learning representations for clustering. In this paper, we propose Deep Embedded Clustering (DEC), a method that simultaneously learns feature representations and cluster assignments using deep neural networks. DEC learns a mapping from the data space to a lower-dimensional feature space in which it iteratively optimizes a clustering objective. Our experimental evaluations on image and text corpora show significant improvement over state-of-the-art methods.",
    "We refine a stimulating study by Sarvotham et al. [2005] which highlighted the influence of peak transmission rate on network burstiness. From TCP packet headers, we amalgamate packets into sessions where each session is characterized by a 5-tuple (S, D, R, Peak R, Initiation T)=(total payload, duration, average transmission rate, peak transmission rate, initiation time). After careful consideration, a new definition of peak rate is required. Unlike Sarvotham et al. [2005] who segmented sessions into two groups labelled alpha and beta, we segment into 10 sessions according to the empirical quantiles of the peak rate variable as a demonstration that the beta group is far from homogeneous. Our more refined segmentation reveals additional structure that is missed by segmentation into two groups. In each segment, we study the dependence structure of (S, D, R) and find that it varies across the groups. Furthermore, within each segment, session initiation times are well approximated by a Poisson process whereas this property does not hold for the data set taken as a whole. Therefore, we conclude that the peak rate level is important for understanding structure and for constructing accurate simulations of data in the wild. We outline a simple method of simulating network traffic based on our findings.",
    "The Brouwer fixed-point theorem in topology states that for any continuous mapping $f$ on a compact convex set into itself admits a fixed point, i.e., a point $x_0$ such that $f(x_0)=x_0$. Under certain conditions, this fixed point corresponds to the throat of a traversable wormhole, i.e., $b(r_0)=r_0$ for the shape function $b=b(r)$. The possible existence of wormholes can therefore be deduced from purely mathematical considerations without going beyond the existing physical requirements.",
    "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been recently employed to solve problems from both the computer vision and medical image analysis fields. Despite their popularity, most approaches are only able to process 2D images while most medical data used in clinical practice consists of 3D volumes. In this work we propose an approach to 3D image segmentation based on a volumetric, fully convolutional, neural network. Our CNN is trained end-to-end on MRI volumes depicting prostate, and learns to predict segmentation for the whole volume at once. We introduce a novel objective function, that we optimise during training, based on Dice coefficient. In this way we can deal with situations where there is a strong imbalance between the number of foreground and background voxels. To cope with the limited number of annotated volumes available for training, we augment the data applying random non-linear transformations and histogram matching. We show in our experimental evaluation that our approach achieves good performances on challenging test data while requiring only a fraction of the processing time needed by other previous methods.",
    "As well known, the spectrum of a non-relativistic two-body system interacting by the Coulomb potential is the Balmer series $E_n=\\frac{\\alpha^2m}{4n^2}$ produced by the Schr\\\"odinger equation. In 1954, Wick and Cutkosky have found, in the Bethe-Salpeter equation framework, that for $\\alpha>\\frac{\\pi}{4}$ the relativistic effects result in new levels (in addition to the Balmer series). However, the physical nature of these new states remained unclear and therefore their existence was being questioned. We have recently shown that these extra states are dominated by the exchange (massless) particles, moving with speed of light. That's why they did not appear in the non-relativistic (Schr\\\"odinger) framework.",
    "We study the fundamental properties of the quantum f-relative entropy, where f(.) is an operator convex function. We give the equality conditions under monotonicity and joint convexity, and these conditions are more general than, since they hold for a class of operator convex functions, and different for f(t) = -ln(t) from, the previously known conditions. The quantum f-entropy is defined in terms of the quantum f-relative entropy and we study its properties giving the equality conditions in some cases. We then show that the f-generalizations of the Holevo information, the entanglement-assisted capacity, and the coherent information also satisfy the data processing inequality, and give the equality conditions for the f-coherent information.",
    "Translating or rotating an input image should not affect the results of many computer vision tasks. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are already translation equivariant: input image translations produce proportionate feature map translations. This is not the case for rotations. Global rotation equivariance is typically sought through data augmentation, but patch-wise equivariance is more difficult. We present Harmonic Networks or H-Nets, a CNN exhibiting equivariance to patch-wise translation and 360-rotation. We achieve this by replacing regular CNN filters with circular harmonics, returning a maximal response and orientation for every receptive field patch. H-Nets use a rich, parameter-efficient and low computational complexity representation, and we show that deep feature maps within the network encode complicated rotational invariants. We demonstrate that our layers are general enough to be used in conjunction with the latest architectures and techniques, such as deep supervision and batch normalization. We also achieve state-of-the-art classification on rotated-MNIST, and competitive results on other benchmark challenges.",
    "We measure and analyze reflection spectra of directly coupled systems of waveguides and cavities. The observed Fano lines offer insight in the reflection and coupling processes. Very different from side-coupled systems, the observed Fano line shape is not caused by the termini of the waveguide, but the coupling process between the measurement device fiber and the waveguide. Our experimental results and analytical model show that the Fano parameter that describes the Fano line shape is very sensitive to the coupling condition. A movement of the fiber well below the Rayleigh range can lead to a drastic change of the Fano line shape.",
    "The strength and vertical distribution of atmospheric turbulence is a key factor determining the performance of optical and infrared telescopes, with and without adaptive optics. Yet, this remains challenging to measure. We describe a new technique using a sequence of short-exposure images of a star field, obtained with a small telescope. Differential motion between all pairs of star images is used to compute the structure functions of longitudinal and transverse wavefront tilt for a range of angular separations. These are compared with theoretical predictions of simple turbulence models by means of a Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo optimization. The method is able to estimate the turbulence profile in the lower atmosphere, the total and free-atmosphere seeing, and the outer scale. We present results of Monte-Carlo simulations used to verify the technique, and show some examples using data from the second AST3 telescope at Dome A in Antarctica.",
    "We define an n-plectic structure as a commutative and torsionless Lie Rinehart pair, together with a distinguished cocycle from its Chevalley-Eilenberg complex. This 'n-plectic cocycle' gives rise to an extension of the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex by so called symplectic tensors. The cohomology of this extension generalizes Hamiltonian functions and vector fields to tensors and cotensors in a range of degrees, up to certain coboundaries and has the structure of a Lie oo-algebra. Finally we show, that momentum maps appear in this context just as weak Lie oo-morphisms from an arbitrary Lie oo-algebra into the Lie oo-algebra of Hamiltonian (co)tensors.",
    "Amorphous solids or glasses are known to exhibit stretched-exponential decay over broad time intervals in several of their macroscopic observables: intermediate scattering function, dielectric relaxation modulus, time-elastic modulus etc. This behaviour is prominent especially near the glass transition. In this Letter we show, on the example of dielectric relaxation, that stretched-exponential relaxation is intimately related to the peculiar lattice dynamics of glasses. By reformulating the Lorentz model of dielectric matter in a more general form, we express the dielectric response as a function of the vibrational density of states (DOS) for a random assembly of spherical particles interacting harmonically with their nearest-neighbours. Surprisingly we find that near the glass transition for this system (which coincides with the Maxwell rigidity transition), the dielectric relaxation is perfectly consistent with stretched-exponential behaviour with Kohlrausch exponents $0.56 < \\beta < 0.65$, which is the range where exponents are measured in most experimental systems. Crucially, the root cause of stretched-exponential relaxation can be traced back to soft modes (boson-peak) in the DOS.",
    "To highlight the challenges of achieving representation disentanglement for text domain in an unsupervised setting, in this paper we select a representative set of successfully applied models from the image domain. We evaluate these models on 6 disentanglement metrics, as well as on downstream classification tasks and homotopy. To facilitate the evaluation, we propose two synthetic datasets with known generative factors. Our experiments highlight the existing gap in the text domain and illustrate that certain elements such as representation sparsity (as an inductive bias), or representation coupling with the decoder could impact disentanglement. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first attempt on the intersection of unsupervised representation disentanglement and text, and provides the experimental framework and datasets for examining future developments in this direction.",
    "This paper proposes a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm to solve a fundamental power system problem called unit commitment (UC). The UC problem is decomposed into a quadratic subproblem, a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) subproblem, and an unconstrained quadratic subproblem. A classical optimization solver solves the first and third subproblems, while the QUBO subproblem is solved by a quantum algorithm called quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). The three subproblems are then coordinated iteratively using a three-block alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm. Using Qiskit on the IBM Q system as the simulation environment, simulation results demonstrate the validity of the proposed algorithm to solve the UC problem.",
    "It has also been suggested that the detection of a wealth of very low amplitude modes in Delta Sct stars was only a matter of signal--to--noise ratio. Access to this treasure, impossible from the ground, is one of the scientific aims of the space mission CoRoT, a space mission developed and operated by CNES. This work presents the results obtained on HD 50844: the 140,016 datapoints were analysed using independent approaches and several checks performed. A level of 10^{-5} mag was reached in the amplitude spectra of the CoRoT timeseries. The frequency analysis of the CoRoT timeseries revealed hundreds of terms in the frequency range 0--30 d^{-1}. All the cross--checks confirmed this new result. The initial guess that Delta Sct stars have a very rich frequency content is confirmed. The spectroscopic mode identification gives theoretical support since very high--degree modes (up to ell=14) are identified. We also prove that cancellation effects are not sufficient in removing the flux variations associated to these modes at the noise level of the CoRoT measurements. The ground--based observations indicate that HD 50844 is an evolved star that is slightly underabundant in heavy elements, located on the Terminal Age Main Sequence. Probably due to this unfavourable evolutionary status, no clear regular distribution is observed in the frequency set. The predominant term (f_1=6.92 d^{-1}) has been identified as the fundamental radial mode combining ground-based photometric and spectroscopic data. This work is also based on observations made with ESO telescopes under the ESO Large Programme LP178.D-0361 and on data collected at the Observatorio de Sierra Nevada, at the Observatorio Astronomico Nacional San Pedro Martir, and at the Piszkesteto Mountain Station of Konkoly Observatory.",
    "The article deals with observations of star-forming regions S231-S235 in 'quasi-thermal' lines of ammonia (NH$_3$), cyanoacetylene (HC$_3$N) and maser lines of methanol (CH$_3$OH) and water vapor (H$_2$O). S231-S235 regions is situated in the giant molecular cloud G174+2.5. We selected all massive molecular clumps in G174+2.5 using archive CO data. For the each clump we determined mass, size and CO column density. After that we performed observations of these clumps. We report about first detections of NH$_3$ and HC$_3$N lines toward the molecular clumps WB89 673 and WB89 668. This means that high-density gas is present there. Physical parameters of molecular gas in the clumps were estimated using the data on ammonia emission. We found that the gas temperature and the hydrogen number density are in the ranges 16-30 K and 2.8-7.2$\\times10^3$ cm$^{-3}$, respectively. The shock-tracing line of CH$_3$OH molecule at 36.2 GHz is newly detected toward WB89 673.",
    "We report the lowest frequency measurements of gamma-ray burst (GRB) 171205A with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) covering a frequency range from 250--1450 MHz and a period of $4-937$ days. It is the first GRB afterglow detected at 250--500 MHz frequency range and the second brightest GRB detected with the uGMRT. Even though the GRB is observed for nearly 1000 days, there is no evidence of transition to non-relativistic regime. We also analyse the archival ${\\it Chandra}$ X-ray data on day $\\sim 70$ and day $\\sim 200$. We also find no evidence of a jet break from the analysis of combined data. We fit synchrotron afterglow emission arising from a relativistic, isotropic, self-similar deceleration as well as from a shock-breakout of wide-angle cocoon. Our data also allow us to discern the nature and the density of the circumburst medium. We find that the density profile deviates from a standard constant density medium and suggests that the GRB exploded in a stratified wind like medium. Our analysis shows that the lowest frequency measurements covering the absorbed part of the light curves are critical to unravel the GRB environment. Our data combined with other published measurements indicate that the radio afterglow has contribution from two components: a weak, possibly slightly off-axis jet and a surrounding wider cocoon, consistent with the results of Izzo et al. (2019). The cocoon emission likely dominates at early epochs, whereas the jet starts to dominate at later epochs, resulting in flatter radio lightcurves.",
    "The recently developed theory of quasi-Lie schemes is studied and applied to investigate several equations of Emden type and a scheme to deal with them and some of their generalisations is given. As a first result we obtain t-dependent constants of the motion for particular instances of Emden equations by means of some of their particular solutions. Previously known results are recovered from this new perspective. Finally some t-dependent constants of the motion for equations of Emden type satisfying certain conditions are recovered.",
    "We undertake the study of the charged Higgs bosons predicted by the model with gauge symmetry $SU(3)_c \\otimes SU(3)_L \\otimes U(1)_X$. By considering Yukawa mixing couplings between small ($\\sim$ GeV) and large ($\\sim$ TeV) scales, we show that the hypercharge-one $H_1^{\\pm}$ and hypercharge-two $H_2^{\\pm}$ Higgs bosons predicted by the model, can be simultaneously produced in $pp$ collisions at different production rates. At low energy, the $H_1^{\\pm}$ bosons exhibit the same properties as the charged Higgs bosons from a two Higgs doublet model (2HDM), while $H_2^{\\pm}$ are additional like-charged Higgs bosons from the underlying 3-3-1 model. Thus, the identification of multiple like-charged Higgs boson resonances may test the compatibility of theoretical models with experimental data. We study $H_{1,2}^{\\pm}$ pair and associated $tbH_{1,2}^{\\pm}$ productions at CERN LHC collider. In particular, we obtain that pair production can be as large as the single production in gluon-gluon collisions due to the interchange of a heavy neutral $Z'$ gauge boson predicted by the model. By considering decays to leptons $H_{1,2}^{\\pm} \\rightarrow \\tau \\nu_{\\tau}$, we obtain scenarios where small peaks of $H_{2}^{\\pm}$-boson events in transverse mass distributions can be identified over the $H_{1}^{\\pm}$ background.",
    "Isospin breaking in the $K_{\\ell 4}$ form factors induced by the difference between charged and neutral pion masses is discussed within a framework built on suitably subtracted dispersion representations. The $K_{\\ell 4}$ form factors are constructed in an iterative way up to two loops in the low-energy expansion by implementing analyticity, crossing, and unitarity due to two-meson intermediate states. Analytical expressions for the phases of the two-loop form factors of the $K^\\pm\\to\\pi^+\\pi^- e^\\pm \\nu_e$ channel are presented, allowing one to connect the difference of form-factor phase shifts measured experimentally (out of the isospin limit) and the difference of $S$- and $P$-wave $\\pi\\pi$ phase shifts studied theoretically (in the isospin limit). The dependence with respect to the two $S$-wave scattering lengths $a_0^0$ and $a_0^2$ in the isospin limit is worked out in a general way, in contrast to previous analyses based on one-loop chiral perturbation theory. The results on the phases of the $K^\\pm\\to\\pi^+\\pi^- e^\\pm \\nu_e$ form factors obtained by the NA48/2 collaboration at the CERN SPS are reanalysed including isospin-breaking correction to extract values for the scattering lengths $a_0^0$ and $a_0^2$.",
    "In this paper we use and extend the results present in \\cite{1,2,3,4} and in particular in \\cite{4} to obtain a statistical description of the cosmological constant in a cosmological de Sitter universe in terms of massless excitations with Planckian effects. First of all, we show that at a classical level, the cosmological constant $\\Lambda>0$ can be obtained only for $T\\rightarrow 0$. Similarly to the black hole case, when quantum effects are taken into account, a representation for $\\Lambda$ is possible in terms of massless excitations, provided that quantum corrections to the Misner-Sharp mass are considered. Moreover, thanks to quantum fluctuations, an effective cosmological constant arises depending on the physical scale under consideration, thus representing a possible solution to the cosmological constant problem without introducing a quintessence field. The smalness of the actual value for $\\Lambda$ can be due to the existence of a quantum decoherence scale above the Planck length such that the spacetime evolves as a pure de Sitter universe with a small averaged cosmological constant frozen in the lowest energy state.",
    "We investigate zero and finite temperature properties of the one-dimensional spin-glass model for vector spins in the limit of an infinite number m of spin components where the interactions decay with a power, \\sigma, of the distance. A diluted version of this model is also studied, but found to deviate significantly from the fully connected model. At zero temperature, defect energies are determined from the difference in ground-state energies between systems with periodic and antiperiodic boundary conditions to determine the dependence of the defect-energy exponent \\theta on \\sigma. A good fit to this dependence is \\theta =3/4-\\sigma. This implies that the upper critical value of \\sigma is 3/4, corresponding to the lower critical dimension in the d-dimensional short-range version of the model. For finite temperatures the large m saddle-point equations are solved self-consistently which gives access to the correlation function, the order parameter and the spin-glass susceptibility. Special attention is paid to the different forms of finite-size scaling effects below and above the lower critical value, \\sigma =5/8, which corresponds to the upper critical dimension 8 of the hypercubic short-range model.",
    "The members of the scarce category of Of^+ supergiants present properties that are intermediate between regular O-stars and Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars. Significant similarities between these transitional stars and WN-type objects are now clearly established, at least in the visible and near-infrared domains, pointing to common stellar wind properties. In this study, we report on the first dedicated X-ray observations of HD16691 (O4If^+) and HD14947 (O5f^+), revealing a soft thermal spectrum in agreement with the expected X-ray emission from a single O-type star. However, the X-ray luminosity of our targets is slightly lower than expected for single O-type stars, suggesting that the particular properties of their stellar wind has also a significant impact on the X-ray emission of these objects on the way to the WN category. We argue that the X-ray under-luminosity of HD16691 and HD14947 may be interpreted as the signature in X-rays of the intermediate stage between O and WR stars, as a consequence of enhanced wind density.",
    "The AARTFAAC project aims to implement an All-Sky Monitor (ASM), using the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) telescope. It will enable real-time, 24x7 monitoring for low frequency radio transients over most of the sky locally visible to the LOFAR at timescales ranging from milliseconds to several days, and rapid triggering of follow-up observations with the full LOFAR on detection of potential transient candidates. These requirements pose several implementation challenges: imaging of an all-sky field of view, low latencies of processing, continuous availability and autonomous operation of the ASM. The first of these has already resulted in the correlator for the ASM being the largest in the world in terms of its number of input channels. It will generate $\\sim 1.5 \\cdot 10^5$ correlations per second per spectral channel when built. Test observations using existing LOFAR infrastructure were carried out to quantify and constrain crucial instrumental design criteria for the ASM. In this paper, we present an overview of the AARTFAAC data processing pipeline and illustrate some of the aforementioned challenges by showing all-sky images obtained from one of the test observations. These results provide quantitative estimates of the capabilities of the instrument.",
    "Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars are the evolved descendants of massive O-type stars and are considered to be progenitor candidates for Type Ib/c core-collapse supernovae (SNe). Recent results of our HST/WFC3 survey of Wolf-Rayet stars in M101 are summarised based on the detection efficiency of narrow-band optical imaging compared to broad-band methods. Weshow that on average of 42% WR stars, increasing to ~85% in central regions, are only detected in the narrow-band imaging. Hence, the non-detection of a WR star at the location of ~10 Type Ib/c SNe in broad-band imaging is no longer strong evidence for a non-WR progenitor channel."

    "Process calculi grounded in logic, like $\\pi$DILL and CP, provide a robust basis for deadlock-free concurrent programming. However, prior research reveals a discrepancy between the proof-construction rules and the term constructors of the $\\pi$-calculus: specifically, the primary operator for parallel composition does not align with any rule in linear logic. Kokke et al. (2019) proposed Hypersequent Classical Processes (HCP) to resolve this inconsistency by employing hypersequents (collections of sequents) to encapsulate parallelism in the typing judgments. Despite this innovation, the leap from CP to HCP is substantial. Currently, HCP lacks reduction semantics, and the introduction of delayed actions causes CP processes interpreted as HCP processes to behave differently than in CP. We present HCP-, a variant of HCP that includes reduction semantics and eliminates delayed actions. We demonstrate progress, preservation, and termination, and show that HCP- upholds the same communication protocols as CP.",
    "This text presents a variant of the BDDC preconditioner that imposes constraints on selected subdomain subobjects (subedges, subfaces, and vertices between pairs of subedges). We show that the preconditioner's condition number is bounded by $C \\big(1+\\log (L/h)\\big)^2$, where $C$ is a constant, and $h$ and $L$ are the characteristic sizes of the mesh and the subobjects, respectively. By choosing $L$ appropriately, the condition number can be as small as $O(1)$. We discuss the preconditioner's advantages and disadvantages and its application to heterogeneous problems, providing numerical results on supercomputers.",
    "We provide instances where the Heun function appears as solutions to wave equations found in general relativity. In four-dimensional spacetime, the Dirac equation within the context of the Nutku helicoid metric produces Mathieu functions as its solutions. When extended to five dimensions, this scenario leads to the double confluent Heun function. Through specific transformations, we simplify this solution back to the Mathieu function. Due to the singularity at the origin within this metric, it is necessary to implement Atiyah-Patodi-Singer spectral boundary conditions for the system.",
    "Many authors have shown that the gradual decrease in X-rays during the decay phase of long-duration flares (LDEs) can only be explained by continuous magnetic reconnection and energy release in the flare's coronal region. Using RHESSI data, we aim to determine the effectiveness of these processes during the LDE decay phase and how accurately the energy release rate can be calculated. To achieve this, we reconstructed images of selected LDEs during their decay phase. The physical parameters of flare coronal sources from image spectral analysis helped us evaluate the energy release efficiency. We also examined the terms in the energy equation to assess the accuracy of each term's determination.",
    "Using a multi-scale analysis, we characterize the typical geometric structure of clusters under the FK measure in random media. Our results are valid in dimensions of 2 or higher, assuming slab percolation occurs under the averaged measure, which is expected throughout the supercritical phase. This work builds on Pisztora's findings and offers a crucial tool for analyzing the supercritical regime in disordered FK models and the related disordered Ising and Potts models.",
    "Photospheric absorption lines in classical T Tauri stars (CTTS) are pretty weak compared to normal stars. This phenomenon, called veiling, usually happens because of extra continuous emission from shock-heated gas at the stellar surface below the accretion streams. We picked four stars (RW Aur A, RU Lup, S CrA NW, and S CrA SE) with notably strong veiling to look closely at how veiling relates to stellar brightness and emission line strengths compared to standard accretion models. We've monitored these stars both photometrically and spectroscopically at various times.\n\nIn typical accretion models, if the accretion rate changes, the excess emission should change too. So, the star's brightness should vary as well. We found that the veiling of absorption lines in these stars changes a lot and is usually so strong that it would need the release of several stellar luminosities of potential energy. During states of very high line dilution, the large veiling factors derived only weakly correlate with brightness. Plus, the emission line strengths don't follow the expected trend of veiling versus line strength. Veiling can change dramatically in just one night and isn't linked to the rotation periods found for two of the stars.\n\nIn at least three of the stars, when veiling gets high, the photospheric lines get filled in by line emission, leading to large veiling factors that aren't connected to any changes in continuous emission from shock regions. We also look into how much dust extinction and electron scattering in the accretion stream might affect veiling measurements in CTTS. In the end, we conclude that the degree of veiling can't be used as a measure of accretion rates in CTTS with a lot of emission lines.",
    "Giant low surface brightness (GLSB) galaxies are typically believed to be massive systems dominated by dark matter, based on uncertain rotation curve data. In this study, we examine two prototypical GLSB galaxies: Malin 1 and NGC 7589. By re-analyzing existing HI observations, we derived new rotation curves to investigate the distributions of luminous and dark matter within these galaxies. Contrary to previous studies, our rotation curves reveal a steep rise in the central regions, characteristic of high surface brightness (HSB) systems. Mass decomposition with a dark matter halo indicates that baryons might dominate the dynamics in these inner regions. A \"maximum disk\" fit yields stellar mass-to-light ratios consistent with those typically found in HSB galaxies. These findings, along with other recent studies, suggest that GLSB galaxies have a double structure: an inner HSB early-type spiral galaxy and an extended outer LSB disk. Additionally, we tested the Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) theory: it successfully reproduces the rotation curve of NGC 7589, while Malin 1 presents a more challenging case for the theory.",
    "This study investigates the multiplicity distribution, multiplicity moments, scaled variance, entropy, and reduced entropy of target-evaporated fragments emitted in forward and backward hemispheres during interactions between emulsion heavy targets (AgBr) and projectiles such as 12 A GeV $^{4}$He, 3.7 A GeV $^{16}$O, 60 A GeV $^{16}$O, 1.7 A GeV $^{84}$Kr, and 10.7 A GeV $^{197}$Au. The findings reveal that the multiplicity distribution of these target-evaporated fragments follows a Gaussian distribution in both hemispheres. Additionally, the multiplicity moments of these fragments show an increase with the order of the moment (q). Notably, the second-order multiplicity moment remains consistent across all energy levels for each interaction type in both hemispheres. The scaled variance, which measures multiplicity fluctuations, is approximately one for all interactions, indicating a weak correlation among the produced particles. Furthermore, the entropy of the target-evaporated fragments is found to be the same within experimental errors for both hemispheres.",
    "We theoretically investigate the temporal behavior of a quantum dot under off-resonant optical excitation aimed at fast acoustic phonon-assisted state preparation. We show that short laser pulses drive three key processes: state dressing during pulse onset, phonon-induced relaxation, and state undressing at pulse end. By analyzing different pulse shapes, we emphasize the critical role of adiabatic undressing on the final state. Additionally, in exciton-biexciton systems, the laser characteristics—pulse detuning, pulse length, and biexciton binding energy—enable the selection of the targeted quantum dot state.",
    "In quantum mechanics, the probabilistic interpretation is an additional aspect imposed by experimental evidence, not inherent in the mathematical model. However, quantum logics with unique conditional probabilities provide a model with a clear probabilistic interpretation from the start. This includes the projection lattices in von Neumann algebras, where probability updates align with the state transition during the Lueders-von Neumann measurement process. This framework defines five levels of compatibility and measurability in quantum logics with unique conditional probabilities: absence of quantum interference, existence of a joint distribution, simultaneous measurability, independence from the measurement order, and belonging to the same Boolean subalgebra. Generally, these five levels differ, but they coincide in the common Hilbert space formalism of quantum mechanics, von Neumann algebras, and some other cases.",
    "This study analyzes wave-vector dispersion in elliptically birefringent stratified magneto-optic media with one-dimensional periodicity. It reveals that differences in local normal-mode polarization states between adjacent layers cause mode coupling, which affects wave-vector dispersion and the nature of the system's Bloch states. This mode coupling introduces additional terms into the dispersion relation that are absent in uniformly circularly birefringent magneto-optic stratified media. Under certain conditions, normal mode coupling eliminates degeneracy at frequency band crossover points and creates a magnetization-dependent optical band gap. The research investigates the conditions necessary for band gap formation and demonstrates that the frequency split can be characterized by a simple coupling parameter based on the polarization state relationships of adjacent layers' local normal modes. It also analyzes the characteristics of Bloch states and the conditions for optimizing band splitting strength in these systems.",
    "We delve into a broader version of traditional empirical risk minimization, where the hypothesis space emerges as a random subspace within an established space. Specifically, we explore subspaces that might be influenced by data, forming from a random selection of the data, which includes the Nyström methods for kernel techniques as a specific example. Utilizing random subspaces can naturally cut down on computational expenses, however, it raises the question of whether this approach compromises learning accuracy. These trade-offs between statistics and computation have been recently investigated for loss functions like least squares and self-concordant types, such as the logistic loss. Here, we aim to broaden these findings to encompass convex Lipschitz loss functions, which may not exhibit smoothness, like the hinge loss employed in support vector machines. Achieving this extension necessitates crafting new proofs with distinct technical approaches. Our principal findings indicate that there are various scenarios, contingent upon the complexity of the learning task, where enhancing computational efficiency does not result in a performance drop. These theoretical insights are backed by straightforward numerical experiments.",
    "The concept of patient consent is crucial for accessing medical data. In traditional healthcare systems, consent is obtained through a form that the patient completes and signs. In e-Health systems, this paper-form consent is being replaced by embedding consent mechanisms directly into the systems that control access to medical data. This transition empowers patients to grant and revoke consent more efficiently. However, the procedures for granting and revoking consent can vary significantly depending on the patient's circumstances. Our central argument is that capturing such detailed consent requirements through a set of authorization policies is highly complex and prone to errors. In this paper, we introduce ACTORS, a goal-driven method for managing consent. The key idea behind ACTORS is to utilize the goal-oriented approach of Teleo-Reactive (TR) programming to manage consent, accommodating changes in the domains and contexts in which patients provide their consent.",
    "This paper analyzes the inverse random source problem for the time fractional diffusion equation driven by fractional Brownian motion. It examines the stochastic time fractional diffusion equation (direct problem) and aims to determine the statistical properties of the source from final time data (inverse problem). The direct problem is shown to be well-posed with a unique mild solution under certain conditions. For the inverse problem, uniqueness is proved and instability is characterized, utilizing the Mittag–Leffler function and stochastic integrals associated with fractional Brownian motion.",
    "Dive into the world of manifold learning, where advanced methods revolutionize nonlinear dimensionality reduction, tackling high-dimensional data sets with a low intrinsic dimensionality. Central to these methods are graph-based techniques: each data point is represented by a vertex, and weighted edges define connections between pairs. Traditional theories have shown that the graph's Laplacian matrix approximates the Laplace-Beltrami operator on the data manifold, assuming Euclidean-based affinities.\n\nIn an exciting twist, our research extends this theory to encompass $\\textit{any}$ norm. By delving into the relationship between the manifold's second fundamental form and the convex geometry of the norm's unit ball, we uncover the limiting differential operator for graph Laplacians built on various norms.\n\nWe showcase the advantages of non-Euclidean norms in manifold learning through a compelling case: mapping the dynamic movement of large, continuously variable molecules. Our numerical simulations reveal that a tweaked Laplacian eigenmaps algorithm, leveraging the Earthmover's distance, surpasses the traditional Euclidean approach. It not only slashes computational costs but also reduces the sample size required to accurately capture the intrinsic geometry.",
    "We introduce an efficient integral equation method to solve the heat equation \\(u_t(\\mathbf{x}) - \\Delta u(\\mathbf{x}) = F(\\mathbf{x}, t)\\) in a two-dimensional, multiply connected domain with Dirichlet boundary conditions. Instead of relying on heat kernel-based integral equations, we first discretize the problem in time. This results in a non-homogeneous modified Helmholtz equation that needs to be solved at each time step. The solution of this equation is expressed as a combination of a volume potential and a double layer potential. The volume potential is computed using a fast multipole-accelerated solver. To satisfy the boundary conditions, we solve an integral equation for the homogeneous modified Helmholtz equation, which is also accelerated by the fast multipole method (FMM). For a total of \\(N\\) points used in the discretization of the boundary and the domain, the overall computational cost per time step is \\(O(N)\\) or \\(O(N \\log N)\\).",
    "We explore a method involving sequential state-discrimination measurements on qudits to identify the quantum state they were originally in. These qudits are part of a set of non-orthogonal quantum states, making them indistinguishable with absolute certainty. Unambiguous state discrimination allows for error-free measurements but may sometimes fail to provide a definitive answer about the qudit's state. Qudits can potentially convey more information per transmission compared to qubits. We examined the scenario where Alice sends one of N qudits, where each qudit is of dimension N. We investigate two situations: one where all states have the same overlap, and another where qudits are divided into two groups with differing overlaps between sets. Additionally, we analyze the resilience of our method against a straightforward eavesdropping attempt and discovered that utilizing qudits instead of qubits increases the likelihood of error introduction by eavesdroppers, thereby making them more detectable.",
    "This study aims to enhance secure access control in the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain by integrating multiple IDs, attributes, and policies with the components that manage access control. Initially, the existing access control system in Hyperledger Fabric is thoroughly examined. Subsequently, a new implementation is proposed that enhances the current solution and offers users and developers simpler methods to make access control decisions using combinations of multiple IDs, attributes, and policies. Our proposed implementation includes encapsulating the Fabric CA client to facilitate adding attributes and streamlining the registration and enrollment of newly created certificates for new users. The research concludes that combining multiple IDs, attributes, and policies is feasible using Hyperledger Fabric's smart contract technology. Additionally, it was observed that the performance impact on real-world applications is minimal compared to the insecure scenario of always granting resource access without any access control.",
    "This work presents pyramidal convolution (PyConv), which can process input at multiple filter scales. PyConv contains a hierarchy of kernels, each with different filter sizes and depths, capturing various levels of detail in the scene. Despite its enhanced recognition capabilities, PyConv is efficient and does not increase computational cost and parameters compared to standard convolution. It is also highly flexible and extensible, offering a wide range of possible network architectures for various applications. PyConv has the potential to influence nearly every computer vision task. In this work, we introduce different PyConv-based architectures for four primary visual recognition tasks: image classification, video action classification/recognition, object detection, and semantic image segmentation/parsing. Our approach demonstrates significant improvements over these core tasks compared to baselines. For example, in image recognition, our 50-layer network outperforms a 152-layer ResNet baseline on the ImageNet dataset, with 2.39 times fewer parameters, 2.52 times lower computational complexity, and over 3 times fewer layers. In image segmentation, our novel framework sets a new state-of-the-art on the challenging ADE20K benchmark for scene parsing. Code is available at: https://github.com/iduta/pyconv",
    "The progress in the search for solar axions using the CERN Axion Solar Telescope (CAST) will be reviewed. Insights from the initial segment of CAST phase II, during which 4He gas at varying pressures filled the magnet bores to probe axion masses up to 0.4 eV, will be shared. In the absence of surplus X-rays when the magnet aligned with the Sun, we establish a typical upper limit on the axion-photon coupling of g < 2.17 x 10^-10 GeV^-1 at the 95% confidence level for axion masses under 0.4 eV, with exact results contingent on the pressure setting. Currently, phase II's second segment focuses on detecting axions with masses up to approximately 1.2 eV utilizing 3He as a buffer gas. Projections for sensitivity will be outlined. Additionally, near-term outlooks and longer-term strategies for a novel helioscope experiment will be discussed.",
    "Observations show that Arctic sea ice is rapidly retreating while Antarctic sea ice is steadily expanding. However, climate models usually predict a moderate decrease in sea ice for both regions. A small subset of models does reflect the observed trends, leading some studies to suggest that considering internal climate variability aligns models with observations. \n\nWe analyzed sea ice changes from 1979-2013 using data from CMIP5 and CESM-LE, based on the relationship between global-mean surface temperature and sea ice extent. Our findings indicate that simulations matching the observed Arctic sea ice retreat show significantly more global warming than observed. Using two methods to estimate sea ice retreat under observed global warming, we found such fast Arctic retreat in simulations occurs less than 1% of the time, suggesting models are inconsistent with observations.\n\nFor the Antarctic, simulations showing sea ice expansion align with insufficient global warming, with less certainty. This inconsistency means simulations fail to capture the observed asymmetry between Arctic and Antarctic sea ice trends, suggesting models are getting the right trends for the wrong reasons in both regions.",
    "Bio-features are rapidly becoming essential tools for authenticating IoT devices. This investigation aims to summarize the factors that hinder the development and deployment of biometric models on a large scale, including human physiological features (e.g., face, eyes, fingerprints, palm, or electrocardiogram) and behavioral features (e.g., signature, voice, gait, or keystroke). It also examines the various machine learning and data mining methods used by authentication and authorization schemes for mobile IoT devices. Additionally, we present the threat models and countermeasures employed by biometrics-based authentication schemes for these devices. Specifically, we analyze the current state of biometric-based authentication schemes for IoT devices. Based on the existing taxonomy, we conclude our paper by discussing the different challenges that future research efforts in biometrics-based authentication schemes for IoT devices must address.",

Almost all existing fingerprinting techniques rely on software running on the device, which users can modify to evade detection. In this position paper, we argue that the advent of the HTML5 standard introduces a new class of fingerprinting features based on the device's hardware. These hardware-based features are much more challenging to alter or obscure, thereby providing a higher degree of confidence in the fingerprint. We propose several methods for HTML5 web applications to identify a device's hardware and present an initial experiment focused on fingerprinting a device's GPU.",
    "We present the partition function of Chern-Simons theory with the exceptional gauge group on a three-sphere, expressed as the partition function of the refined closed topological string. The relationship between the single Kähler parameter $\\tau$, string coupling constant $g_s$, and refinement parameter $b$ is given by $2\\tau=g_s(1-b)$, where $b$ takes specific values ($\\frac{5}{3}, \\frac{5}{2}, 3, 4, 6$) for the exceptional groups $G_2, F_4, E_6, E_7, E_8$ respectively. The key BPS invariants are $N^2_{0,\\frac{1}{2}}=1$ and $N^{11}_{0,1}=1$, and the partition function includes terms related to refined constant maps of string theory.\n\nThis derivation is based on the universal (in Vogel's sense) form of a Chern-Simons partition function on a three-sphere, restricted to the exceptional line $Exc$ where $\\gamma=2(\\α+\\β)$. This line encompasses all exceptional groups. Additionally, similar results apply to the $F$ line $\\gamma=\\α+\\β$ (which includes $SU(4), SO(10)$, and $E_6$ groups), with non-zero BPS invariants $N^2_{0,\\frac{1}{2}}=1$ and $N^{7}_{0,1}=1$.\n\nIn both cases, the refinement parameter $b$ (given by $-\\epsilon_2/\\epsilon_1$ in terms of Nekrasov's parameters) is expressed in terms of universal parameters, restricted to the relevant line, as $b=-\\β/\\α$.",
    "The centerpoint theorem is a prominent result in discrete geometry. It asserts that for any set of $n$ points in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, there exists a point $c$—which need not be part of the original set—such that every halfspace containing $c$ includes at least $\\frac{n}{d+1}$ points from the set. This point, called a centerpoint, can be considered a higher-dimensional generalization of a median, serving as a significant representative for the point set.\n\nHowever, what if we consider multiple representatives? In one-dimensional datasets, for instance, certain quantiles are often used as representatives instead of just the median. Here, we explore extending the concept of quantiles to higher dimensions. Specifically, we aim to identify a set $Q$ of a few points such that any halfspace containing at least one point from $Q$ also contains a substantial fraction of the original point set, $P$. Additionally, any halfspace encompassing more points from $Q$ will contain an even larger fraction of $P$.\n\nThis approach aligns with established concepts like weak $\\varepsilon$-nets and weak $\\varepsilon$-approximations. It is more comprehensive than the former while not as stringent as the latter.",
    "Introducing our groundbreaking software package, \\textsc{PsrPopPy}, crafted for simulating pulsar populations. This innovation is an evolution of the \\textsc{Psrpop} package, meticulously re-engineered in Python while preserving essential Fortran libraries for specific tasks. Leveraging Python's object-oriented capabilities, we've enhanced the modularity and flexibility of the codebase significantly. \n\nFor ease of use, we’ve included pre-written scripts enabling 'standard' operational simulations, yet the design accommodates the crafting of custom scripts, enabling personalized exploration. The modular architecture simplifies the integration of experimental features, such as new period or luminosity distribution models, making it more intuitive than ever. \n\nWe delve into potential future enhancements of the software, illustrating its versatility and power with practical examples. Utilizing survey data from various observing frequencies, we establish that pulsar spectral indices conform to a normal distribution with a mean of -1.4 and a standard deviation of 1.0. Further, we model pulsar spin evolution to refine the relationship between a pulsar's luminosity and its spin parameters.\n\nBy replicating and optimizing the analysis of Faucher-Giguère & Kaspi, we've honed their power-law dependence between radio luminosity ($L$), period ($P$), and period derivative ($\\dot{P}$). Our findings reveal an underlying population best described by $L \\propto P^{-1.39 \\pm 0.09} \\dot{P}^{0.48 \\pm 0.04}$, closely aligning with results for $\\gamma$-ray pulsars by Perera et al.\n\nArmed with this refined relationship, we generate a model population, exploring the age-luminosity dynamics for pulsars. These insights are expected to be measurably significant following future large-scale surveys with the Square Kilometer Array, heralding a new era in pulsar population studies.",
    "We investigate the dynamics of a spin ensemble strongly coupled to a single-mode resonator driven by external pulses. When the mean frequency of the spin ensemble resonates with the cavity mode, we observe damped Rabi oscillations between the spin ensemble and the cavity mode. Our analysis, which accurately accounts for the dephasing effect of inhomogeneous spin broadening, reveals that precise knowledge of this broadening is essential for both qualitative and quantitative understanding of the spin-cavity temporal dynamics. Based on this insight, we demonstrate that coherent oscillations between the spin ensemble and the cavity can be significantly enhanced—by several orders of magnitude—when the system is driven with pulses matching specific resonance conditions. Our theoretical approach is validated by an experiment involving an ensemble of negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, strongly coupled to a superconducting coplanar single-mode waveguide resonator.",
    "We study the ground-state Riemannian metric and cyclic quantum distance of an inhomogeneous quantum Ising spin-1/2 chain in a transverse field. By applying a general canonical transformation, we diagonalize the model's fermionic Hamiltonian mapped from the spin system. The exact ground-state Riemannian metric on a parameter manifold ring $S^1$ is obtained using a gauge transformation with a twist operator. We explore the ground-state cyclic quantum distance and the second derivative of the ground-state energy across different inhomogeneous exchange coupling regions. Notably, we demonstrate that the quantum ferromagnetic phase in the uniform Ising chain is marked by an invariant cyclic quantum distance and a constant ground-state Riemannian metric, which rapidly diminishes to zero in the paramagnetic phase.",
    "Rotation measure synthesis facilitates the estimation of Faraday dispersion through a Fourier transform, serving as a central method for investigating cosmic magnetic fields. We demonstrate that this process is mathematically comparable to the one-dimensional interferometric intensity measurement equation, albeit within a different Fourier space. Consequently, established concepts from two-dimensional intensity interferometry, which are designed to address various instrumental conditions, can be applied to Faraday dispersion analysis. Specifically, we illustrate a model for the impact of channel averaging during Faraday reconstruction, a factor that has previously hindered advancements in polarimetric science using wide-band measurements. Additionally, we simulate one-dimensional sparse reconstruction with channel averaging for realistic frequency ranges, showing the feasibility of detecting signals with high rotation measure values that were previously undetectable. This is particularly crucial for low-frequency and wide-band polarimetry. We extend these concepts to include mosaicking in Faraday depth into the channel averaging process. This work provides the first comprehensive framework for accurately performing wide-band rotation measure synthesis, including the integration of data from multiple telescopes, which is expected to significantly enhance the quality and scope of polarimetric research. This advancement is particularly relevant for extreme environments with high magnetic fields, such as those associated with pulsars and Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), and will enable these sources to be effectively used as probes of cosmological magnetic fields.",
    "The study investigates the characteristic properties of charged particle production in hadron-nucleus collisions at high energies using various statistical models. Predictions derived from different approaches, including the Negative Binomial distribution, the shifted Gompertz distribution, the Weibull distribution, and the Krasznovszky-Wagner distribution, are employed for a comparative analysis of these models' relative successes. These distributions, originating from diverse functional forms, are based on either phenomenological parameterizations or theoretical models of the underlying dynamics. Several of these models have also been utilized to analyze data from the LHC for both proton-proton and nucleus-nucleus collisions. The analysis employs a range of physical and derived observables.",
    "In 1975, John Tukey introduced a groundbreaking concept known as the multivariate median—the 'deepest' point within a data cloud in R^d. This sparked a revolution in how we understand data. Building on Tukey's idea, David Donoho and Miriam Gasko later explored how to measure the depth of any point z in relation to a dataset. By examining hyperplanes passing through z, they determined its 'depth' based on the smallest fraction of the data separated by such a hyperplane. \n\nSince then, this pioneering concept has blossomed into a rich statistical methodology centered on data depth and more broadly, nonparametric depth statistics. Various notions of data depth, both general and specific, have emerged. These concepts differ in terms of their computability, robustness, and sensitivity to capturing asymmetrical shapes within the data, making them suitable for different applications.\n\nThe upper-level sets of a depth statistic generate a family of set-valued statistics termed depth-trimmed or central regions. These regions offer a detailed description of a distribution's location, scale, and shape, with the most central region serving as a median. The idea of depth has not only been extended from empirical data clouds to general probability distributions in R^d, supporting laws of large numbers and consistency results, but also to data in functional spaces.\n\nThis evolving field continues to provide valuable insights and tools for analyzing complex datasets, pushing the boundaries of statistical science.",
    "Strain-engineering in SiGe nanostructures is crucial for the development of nanoscale optoelectronic devices. This study introduces a novel approach wherein SiGe structures are laterally confined by a Si substrate to achieve high tensile strain without external stressors, thereby enhancing scalability. We employ spectro-microscopy techniques, finite element method simulations, and ab initio calculations to investigate the strain state of laterally confined Ge-rich SiGe nano-stripes. Using tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy with an exceptional lateral resolution of ~30 nm, we obtain detailed strain information. The nano-stripes display a significant tensile hydrostatic strain component, peaking at the center of the top free surface and diminishing at the edges. The maximum lattice deformation exceeds typical values found in thermally relaxed Ge/Si(001) layers. This strain enhancement arises from frustrated relaxation in the out-of-plane direction, driven by a combination of lateral confinement from the substrate sidewalls and plastic relaxation of misfit strain in the (001) plane at the SiGe/Si interface. The tensile lattice deformation at the stripe surface is examined through work function mapping, utilizing X-ray photoelectron emission microscopy with spatial resolution better than 100 nm. Results indicate a positive work function shift relative to bulk SiGe alloy, confirmed through electronic structure calculations of tensile strained configurations. These findings have significant implications for the design of optoelectronic devices at the nanometer scale.",
    "During an infectious disease pandemic, it is imperative to disseminate electronic medical records or derived models across regions. However, employing data or models from one region in another often presents distribution shift challenges that contravene the assumptions inherent in traditional machine learning methodologies. Transfer learning offers a promising solution to these challenges. To investigate the efficacy of deep transfer learning algorithms, we employed two data-centric approaches—domain adversarial neural networks and maximum classifier discrepancy—and model-centric transfer learning algorithms in the context of infectious disease detection.\n\nAdditionally, we examined well-defined synthetic scenarios where inter-regional data distribution discrepancies were explicitly known. Our experimental findings indicate that, within the realm of infectious disease classification, transfer learning is advantageous under specific conditions: (1) when the source and target datasets are analogous, yet the target training dataset is limited, and (2) when the target training dataset lacks labeling. In the former scenario, model-based transfer learning demonstrated comparable performance to data-based transfer learning models.\n\nNonetheless, further examination of domain shift in real-world research data is essential to address the observed decline in model performance.",
    "Bound states in the continuum (BIC) have been a focal point of optics and photonics research over the past decade. It is particularly intriguing to explore the effects associated with quasi-BICs in the simplest structures, where quasi-BICs are most pronounced, such as dielectric cylinders. Previous studies have investigated quasi-BICs both in single cylinders and in arrays composed of multiple cylinders. \n\nIn this work, we examine the properties of quasi-BICs as we transition from a homogeneous dielectric cylinder in an air environment to a ring with narrow walls, gradually increasing the diameter of the inner air cylinder. The results reveal a transition in quasi-BICs from a strong-coupling to a weak-coupling regime. This transition is characterized by a shift from avoided crossing of branches to their intersection, with the quasi-BIC preserved only on one straight branch.\n\nIn the strong-coupling regime, three waves interfere in the far-field zone: two waves corresponding to the resonant modes of the structure and a wave scattered by the structure as a whole. We also discuss the applicability of the Fano resonance concept, which describes the interference of only two waves under weak coupling conditions.",
    "Turbulent thermal diffusion arises from the interplay between temperature-stratified turbulence and the inertia of small particles. This phenomenon leads to a non-diffusive turbulent flux of particles moving in the direction of the turbulent heat flux. This flux is proportional to the product of the mean particle number density and the effective velocity of inertial particles. Previous theories addressing this effect have been limited to conditions with small temperature gradients and Stokes numbers (Phys. Rev. Lett. {\\bf 76}, 224, 1996). In this research, a comprehensive theory covering a wider range of temperature gradients and Stokes numbers has been developed. Experiments conducted with oscillating grid turbulence and multi-fan generated turbulence were used to test the theory under strongly stratified turbulent conditions. The findings indicate that for high Reynolds numbers, the effective velocity of inertial particles is less than the characteristic vertical turbulent velocity. Both the effective velocity of inertial particles and the effective coefficient of turbulent thermal diffusion increase with rising Stokes numbers, peaking at low Stokes numbers and diminishing for higher values. Additionally, the effective coefficient of turbulent thermal diffusion decreases as the mean temperature gradient increases. The newly developed theory aligns well with the experimental results.",
    "The visibility of pulsar radio emission is traditionally modeled based on the assumption that the emission is confined within a narrow cone aligned with the tangent to a dipolar magnetic field line. A widely accepted approximation, known as the Rotating Vector Model (RVM), simplifies the scenario to a fixed line of sight where the field line is not exactly tangential to the observational path. However, a more precise approach, referred to as the tangent model (Gangadhara 2004), considers that the visible emission point varies with the pulsar rotational phase, denoted by $\\psi$, describing a specific trajectory on a sphere with radius $r$. We have solved for this trajectory and calculated the angular velocity of the visible point along it.\n\nRecent advancements suggest that this motion can be observed using interstellar holography, as noted by Pen et al. (2014). On evaluating the RVM's accuracy, we find that it introduces significant errors, particularly for pulsars with wide-ranging emission over $\\psi$. The RVM tends to underestimate the $\\psi$ range within which emission is detectable. Additionally, geometric considerations indicate that visible pulsar radio emissions likely originate from heights exceeding ten percent of the light-cylinder distance. At such heights, the effects of retardation become non-negligible, which our current model does not account for.",
    "In image recognition, training samples often fail to cover all possible target classes. Zero-shot learning (ZSL) employs class semantic information to classify samples from unseen categories not represented in the training set. This paper introduces the Global Semantic Consistency Network (GSC-Net), an end-to-end framework that fully utilizes the semantic information from both seen and unseen classes for efficient zero-shot learning. Additionally, we implement a soft label embedding loss to better leverage the semantic relationships among classes. To make GSC-Net suitable for the more practical Generalized Zero-shot Learning (GZSL) scenario, we incorporate a parametric novelty detection mechanism. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both ZSL and GZSL tasks across three visual attribute datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed framework.",
    "The common belief that Category Theory underpins Mathematical Structuralism is mistaken. Instead, the foundations of mathematics through Category Theory necessitate a distinct philosophical approach. Unlike structural mathematics, which focuses on invariant forms (as per Awodey), categorical mathematics explores covariant transformations that typically lack invariants. In this paper, I propose a non-structuralist perspective on categorical mathematics and discuss its implications for the history of mathematics and mathematics education.",
    "In this study, we demonstrate that within a non-equilibrium exciton-polariton condensate system, where polaritons are produced through incoherent pumping, a ring-shaped pump facilitates the creation of stationary vortex memory elements characterized by a topological charge of \\( m = 1 \\) or \\( m = -1 \\). Furthermore, by employing straightforward potential guides, we can selectively replicate the same charge or invert it onto another spatially distinct ring pump. This capability for manipulating binary information suggests the potential for a novel type of processing that leverages vortices as topologically protected memory components.",
    "During the three-year assessment phase of the LOFT mission, a candidate for the ESA Cosmic Vision program's M3 launch opportunity, we evaluated the radiation damage to the silicon drift detectors (SDDs) in the satellite's instrumentation. We irradiated the detectors with 0.8 and 11 MeV protons to analyze the increase in leakage current and changes in charge collection efficiency due to displacement damage. We also exposed the detectors to hypervelocity dust grains to assess the impact of debris. This paper describes our measurements and discusses the results within the context of the LOFT mission.",
    "In this paper, we take a closer look at how low-level multimodal features can be used to find movie similarities for content-based movie recommendations. We specifically show how to create multimodal representations of movies using subtitles, audio cues, and visual elements. For textual data, we focus on topic modeling from subtitles to identify themes that distinguish movies. On the visual side, we extract meaningful features that capture camera movements, colors, and faces. For audio, we use basic classification from pretrained models.\n\nWe combine these three elements—text, audio, and visual—with static metadata like directors and actors to enhance the process of finding similar movies. To demonstrate our approach, we created a small dataset of 160 well-known movies, and we used this data to generate recommendation rankings based on the different types of information we combined.\n\nOur extensive experiments show that integrating text, audio, and visual data significantly boosts the performance of content-based recommendation systems by more than 50% compared to using just metadata. As far as we know, this is the first time a method has combined such a wide range of features from all these different types of data to improve content similarity estimation over traditional metadata approaches.",
    "We investigate the radiation emitted by a Reissner-Nordstrom black hole with electric charge within the context of quantum gravity. Utilizing canonical quantization for spherically symmetric geometries and adhering to physically reasonable assumptions, we solve the Wheeler-De Witt equation not only in the region extending from the outer apparent horizon to spatial infinity but also from the spacetime singularity to the inner apparent horizon. Our findings reveal that the mass loss rate of a black hole evaporating due to thermal radiation matches the semiclassical predictions when an integration constant is chosen appropriately based on physical principles. Additionally, we solve the Wheeler-De Witt equation in the region between the inner Cauchy horizon and the outer apparent horizon, demonstrating that the expression for the mass loss rate of the evaporating black hole remains consistent. This study represents a natural extension from the uncharged Schwarzschild black hole scenario to the charged Reissner-Nordstrom black hole case.",
    "We present multi-agent A* (MAA*), the first complete and optimal heuristic search algorithm for decentralized partially-observable Markov decision problems (DEC-POMDPs) with a finite horizon. This algorithm computes optimal plans for cooperative agents in stochastic environments, such as multirobot coordination, network traffic control, and distributed resource allocation. Addressing these problems is a major challenge in planning under uncertainty. Our solution combines classical heuristic search and decentralized control theory. Experimental results highlight MAA*'s significant advantages. We also introduce an anytime variant and discuss potential extensions for solving infinite horizon problems.",
    "We demonstrate morphological classifications generated through machine learning for objects in SDSS DR6, previously classified by Galaxy Zoo into early types, spirals, and point sources/artifacts. An artificial neural network (ANN) is trained using a subset of human-classified objects, and we assess whether the algorithm can replicate the human classifications for the remaining sample. The success of the ANN in matching human classifications is highly dependent on the chosen input parameters for the algorithm. While colors and profile-fitting parameters are effective in differentiating the objects into three classes, incorporating adaptive shape parameters, concentration, and texture significantly improves the results. Alone, adaptive moments, concentration, and texture parameters cannot distinguish early-type galaxies from point sources/artifacts. Utilizing a set of twelve parameters, the ANN achieves over 90% accuracy in replicating human classifications for all three morphological classes. Even an incomplete magnitude training set does not undermine our findings, given our specific choice of network input parameters. We conclude that machine-learning algorithms show promise for morphological classification in future extensive imaging surveys, with the Galaxy Zoo catalog serving as a valuable training resource.",
    "The Lambek calculus is a well-known logical formalism for modeling natural language syntax. The original calculus addressed a substantial number of intricate natural language phenomena, but only within the context-free setting. To tackle more subtle linguistic issues, the Lambek calculus has been extended in various ways. Notably, Morrill and Valentin (2015) introduced an extension that includes exponential and bracket modalities. This extension is based on a non-standard contraction rule for the exponential, which interacts intricately with the bracket structure. The standard contraction rule is not admissible in this calculus. In this paper, we prove the undecidability of the derivability problem in their calculus. We also examine restricted decidable fragments considered by Morrill and Valentin and demonstrate that these fragments fall within the NP class.",
    "The transition between the two phases of 4D Euclidean Dynamical Triangulation was long believed to be of second order. However, in 1996, a first-order behavior was discovered in sufficiently large systems. This finding raised questions about the influence of the numerical methods used: to control volume fluctuations, both studies added an artificial harmonic potential to the action, and in one study, measurements were taken after a fixed number of accepted moves instead of attempted moves, introducing additional error. Moreover, the simulations were affected by strong critical slowing down, which might have been underestimated.\n\nIn the present work, we address these weaknesses by allowing the volume to fluctuate freely within a fixed interval, taking measurements after a fixed number of attempted moves, and using an optimized parallel tempering algorithm to overcome critical slowing down. With these improved methods, on systems of up to 64k 4-simplices, we confirm that the phase transition is first order. Additionally, we discuss a local criterion for deciding whether parts of a triangulation are in the elongated or crumpled state and describe a new correspondence between EDT and the balls-in-boxes model. This model leads to a modified partition function with an additional, third coupling. Finally, we propose a class of modified path-integral measures that might remove the metastability of the Markov chain and convert the phase transition into second order.",
    "Sure, here's a friendlier version:\n\nWe describe the virtually nilpotent finitely generated groups (or, as Gromov's theorem states, groups with polynomial growth) for which the Domino Problem can be solved. These include the virtually free groups, meaning finite groups, and those that have $\\Z$ as a subgroup with a finite index.",
    "Gamma rays from dark matter particle annihilation in the Galactic halo present a highly promising method for indirect dark matter detection. We show that distinct spectral features at energies close to the dark matter particle’s mass, predicted by most models, can greatly enhance gamma-ray telescope sensitivity to dark matter. Our projected limits on these features, including the commonly sought line signals, demonstrate their superior efficiency in constraining dark matter's nature compared to the broader, model-independent spectral features at lower energies.",
    "Achieving carbon neutrality necessitates a research agenda that tackles the technical and economic challenges faced as we move toward complete reliance on renewable electricity generation. Increasing shares of variable renewable energy (VRE) sources (such as wind turbines and photovoltaic systems) complicate the balance between supply and demand in VRE-dominated power grids. The operational features and impacts of VRE inverters also need attention. In this context, we explore the consequences of the transition to carbon neutrality and outline the related research challenges in system planning, operation, and stability. We emphasize the importance of energy storage integration, demand-side participation, distributed control and estimation, and the interconnection of various energy sectors. Additionally, we identify gaps in the current literature and discuss our recent research aimed at bridging these gaps, thereby improving grid operation and assessment. We provide numerical outcomes from comparative case studies on the operational stability and economics of power grids with significant VRE sources, aiding stakeholders in crafting specific roadmaps and making informed decisions.",
    "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are increasingly used in various areas of computer vision due to their ability to process large amounts of labeled data through millions of parameters. However, as CNN models grow larger, their storage and memory requirements also increase. We introduce a novel network architecture called Frequency-Sensitive Hashed Nets (FreshNets), which significantly reduces memory and storage consumption by exploiting redundancy in the convolutional and fully-connected layers of deep learning models. \n\nOur approach is based on the observation that the weights of learned convolutional filters are usually smooth and low-frequency. We first convert these filter weights to the frequency domain using a discrete cosine transform (DCT). Then, we apply a low-cost hash function to randomly group frequency parameters into hash buckets. All parameters assigned to the same hash bucket share a single value learned through standard back-propagation. To further reduce model size, we allocate fewer hash buckets to high-frequency components, which are generally less important.\n\nWe evaluated FreshNets on eight datasets and found that it achieves significantly better compression performance compared to several relevant baselines.",
    "We carried out a Project-Based Learning (PBL) activity that integrated Japanese cartoon (manga) techniques into the Requirements Development (RD) process. Manga possesses well-defined methods for character development and storytelling, which we believed could be effectively applied to RD. Through this manga-driven approach, students managed to clearly identify overarching project objectives early in the development cycle and successfully devised high-quality, innovative system concepts.",
    "When a black hole evaporates, it eventually disappears. To understand this better, we're looking at how particles called fermions escape from a 5-dimensional rotating black string, which is like a stretched-out black hole. The temperature of the black string is influenced not just by itself, but also by the properties of the escaping fermions and the extra spatial dimension they travel through. Because of quantum effects, the temperature increase slows down, which means that the black string doesn't fully evaporate and leaves behind a remnant.",
    "In our study, we introduce second-order vector representations of words derived from the topological features of nearest neighbors in pre-trained contextual word embeddings. We then explore the impact of using these second-order embeddings as input features in three models: two deep natural language processing models for named entity recognition and recognizing textual entailment, and a linear model for paraphrase recognition.\n\nOur surprising findings reveal that nearest neighbor information alone can capture most of the performance advantages typically associated with pre-trained word embeddings. Second-order embeddings, while less specific, excel in handling highly heterogeneous data compared to first-order representations. Moreover, integrating second-order information into contextual embeddings can enhance model performance in certain scenarios.\n\nWe also observe that leveraging nearest neighbor features from multiple first-order embedding samples, given the variance in random initializations, can further boost downstream performance. Finally, we highlight fascinating attributes of second-order embedding spaces, such as higher density and unique semantic interpretations of cosine similarity, warranting further investigation.",
    "Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided millimeter wave wireless systems exhibit enhanced robustness to blockage and extended coverage. In this study, we investigate the potential of RIS to additionally furnish improved localization capabilities as a collateral benefit of communication. We employ sparse reconstruction algorithms to derive high-resolution channel estimates, which are subsequently translated into position information. In RIS-aided mmWave systems, the complexity inherent in sparse recovery becomes a limiting factor, due to the extensive number of RIS elements and expansive communication arrays. We propose leveraging a multidimensional orthogonal matching pursuit strategy for compressive channel estimation within a RIS-aided millimeter wave framework. This algorithm, which computes projections on a series of independent dictionaries rather than a singular, extensive dictionary, facilitates high-precision channel estimation with reduced complexity. Furthermore, we integrate this strategy with a localization method that does not depend on the absolute time of arrival of the Line-of-Sight (LoS) path. Localization analyses conducted in a realistic three-dimensional indoor environment demonstrate that RIS-aided wireless systems can also achieve marked enhancements in localization accuracy.",
    "Ensuring confidentiality requires detecting and quantifying information leaks through timing side channels. While static analysis is the go-to method for spotting these side channels, it's tough to apply in real-world scenarios. Plus, detection techniques often just give a binary 'yes' or 'no' answer. But real-world situations might actually need to leak information. That's where quantification comes in handy to assess the risks posed by such leaks. Given the limitations of static analysis, we've come up with a dynamic analysis method. Our innovative approach breaks the problem down into two tasks: first, we train a neural network to model the program's timing, and then we analyze this network to quantify the leaks. Our experiments show both tasks are practically viable, offering a major leap over current side channel detection and quantification tools. Our main technical achievements include developing a neural network architecture that detects side channels and creating an MILP-based algorithm to measure side-channel strength. We tested our approach on micro-benchmarks and real-world apps, proving that neural networks can learn the timing behaviors of programs with thousands of methods and efficiently identify and quantify leaks through timing side channels.",
    "The inner asteroid belt, spanning 2.1 to 2.5 astronomical units (au), holds particular dynamical significance as it predominantly sources both chondritic meteorites and near-Earth asteroids. This region is delineated by an eccentricity-type secular resonance and the 1:3 mean motion resonance with Jupiter. Unless asteroids possess perihelia sufficiently low to allow scattering by Mars, their escape necessitates transport to one of these bounding resonances. Additionally, Yarkovsky forces are generally ineffective in altering the eccentricity and/or inclination of asteroids with diameters greater than or equal to 30 km. Consequently, large asteroids with perihelia significantly distant from Mars may only exit the inner belt due to substantial changes in their eccentricities.\n\nIn this paper, we systematically examine the chaotic diffusion of orbits near the 1:2 mean motion resonance with Mars. We demonstrate that although chaotic orbital evolution—affecting both resonant and non-resonant orbits—induces increased dispersion of inclinations and eccentricities, it does not substantially alter their mean values. Moreover, we find that while dispersive growth is most pronounced for resonant orbits, at high eccentricities the resonance acts to reduce asteroid scattering by Mars, thereby extending the asteroid's lifespan within the belt compared to non-resonant orbits. For asteroids of all sizes in both resonant and non-resonant orbits, the eccentricity changes required to match observations cannot be attributed to gravitational forces alone. We also analyze the role of resonant trapping in safeguarding asteroids from Mars encounters.",
    "The impact of nonstandard neutrino interactions (NSI) is profound, shaking up the precision measurements at the next wave of neutrino oscillation experiments! To get a clearer picture and pin down the elusive NSI parameter space, we need a variety of experimental setups. Our focus zooms in on the constraints on NSI with electrons at both current and upcoming $e^+e^-$ collider experiments such as Belle II, STCF, and CEPC.\n\nThe results are electrifying! Belle II and STCF are set to deliver competitive and complementary bounds on electron-type NSI parameters, giving the current global analysis a run for its money. Moreover, they promise significant leaps forward in constraining tau-type NSI. But wait, there's more: CEPC could single-handedly clamp down on the NSI parameter space with electrons with impressive precision.\n\nIn an exciting twist, by blending data from three distinct running modes, we can untangle the left-handed (vector) and right-handed (axial-vector) NSI parameters. The allowed ranges for $|\\epsilon_{ee}^{eL}|$ ($|\\epsilon_{ee}^{eV}|$) and $|\\epsilon_{ee}^{eR}|$ ($|\\epsilon_{ee}^{eA}|$) can be squeezed to less than 0.002 at CEPC, even if both parameters coexist. The future of neutrino research looks brighter than ever!",
    "The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) is a cutting-edge initiative aimed at advancing neutrino science and probing proton decay. Its far detector will feature four 10-kiloton Liquid Argon (LAr) Time Projection Chambers, utilizing both single and dual-phase technologies, with the latter providing charge amplification in the gaseous phase. To refine these designs, two sizable prototypes have been gathering data at CERN since 2018. Earlier, a dual-phase 4-tonne demonstrator was constructed and tested with cosmic muons in 2017, demonstrating excellent charge and light collection performance. The light detection system plays a crucial role in triggering the charge acquisition system and gleaning additional information from the scintillation light produced during particle interactions. In the demonstrator, five cryogenic photo-multipliers were tested with various base polarity configurations and wavelength shifting techniques. Throughout the detector's operation, scintillation light data were collected under different drift and amplification field conditions. This overview highlights the light detection system's performance and provides insights into light production and propagation, ultimately enhancing our understanding of LAr properties.",
    "Major chip manufacturers have introduced multithreaded processors designed for diverse workloads, emphasizing efficient resource utilization. Key to their performance is leveraging memory-level parallelism (MLP). This paper proposes an MLP-aware operating system (OS) scheduling algorithm for multithreaded multi-core processors. By monitoring the MLP of each thread and balancing it with system resources, the OS can generate optimized thread schedules for improved performance in the next quantum. We qualitatively compare our solution with existing hardware and software techniques, suggesting that future work should focus on quantitative evaluations and further optimizing the scheduling algorithm.",
    "We address the challenge of calibrating a compressed sensing measurement system where decalibration involves unknown gains for each measurement. Our focus is on blind calibration, which uses measurements from a few unknown, sparse signals. Although a naive approach to this blind calibration problem via $\\ell_{1}$ minimization shares similarities with blind source separation and dictionary learning—both known for their non-convexity and local minima issues—we demonstrate that in this specific context, the problem can be redefined as a convex optimization problem. This allows it to be solved with standard algorithms. Numerical simulations confirm the efficacy of our approach, even with highly uncalibrated measurements, provided that a sufficient number of sparse calibrating signals are available. We also observed that the method’s success exhibits sharp phase transitions.",
    "We delve into the intriguing challenge of multi-source morphological reinflection, an extension of the traditional single-source version. Here, the input comprises two components: (i) a target tag and (ii) several pairs of source forms and source tags associated with a lemma. The driving force behind this approach is the advantage of accessing multiple source forms, as they can provide complementary insights, such as different stems. To tackle this problem more effectively, we introduce an innovative enhancement to the encoder-decoder recurrent neural network architecture, which incorporates multiple encoders. Our findings demonstrate that this advanced architecture surpasses single-source reinflection models. Additionally, we release our dataset for multi-source morphological reinflection to support and inspire future research in this area.",
    "As the demand for timely extraction of complex knowledge from semantically annotated data streams rises, particularly on the Web and in the Internet of Things (IoT), conventional methods face the challenge of performing expressive reasoning on these vast streams efficiently. Enter Laser, our innovative reasoning system that leverages a pragmatic and intricate fragment of the LARS logic—an extension of Answer Set Programming (ASP) tailored for streams. Laser is built around a groundbreaking evaluation procedure that cleverly annotates formulae, eliminating the need to recompute duplicates at various time points. This approach, coupled with an astute implementation of LARS operators, results in markedly enhanced runtimes compared to leading systems like C-SPARQL, CQELS, or even a LARS version running on the ASP solver Clingo. Consequently, Laser enables the application of sophisticated logic-based reasoning to extensive data streams, unlocking a wider array of stream reasoning use cases.",
    "The second law of thermodynamics establishes the fundamental constraints on the exchange of energy and information between physical systems. In this study, we broaden a thermodynamic framework that describes this energy and information flow, previously developed for bipartite systems, to encompass multiple multipartite systems. We define a natural thermodynamic quantity that characterizes the information exchanged among these systems and subsequently present a refined version of this quantity. Our findings are demonstrated through a model involving two competing Maxwell demons.",
    "The intrinsic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in graphene is typically negligible, but it can be enhanced by proximity effects in stacked heterostructures of graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs). The composition of the TMDC layer significantly influences the nature and strength of the induced SOC in the graphene layer. In this study, we investigate how the proximity-induced SOC evolves when defects are deliberately introduced into the TMDC layer. We simulate alloyed ${\\rm G/W_{\\chi}Mo_{1-\\chi}Se_2}$ heterostructures with varying compositions ($\\chi$) and defect distributions using density functional theory. By comparing these results with continuum and tight-binding models, we identify both local and global effects of metal-atom alloying. Our findings indicate that, despite significant local perturbations due to individual defects, the overall low-energy spin and electronic behavior can be described by a simple effective medium model, which depends solely on the composition ratio of the metallic species in the TMDC layer. Additionally, we demonstrate that the topological state of these alloyed systems can be tuned by adjusting this composition ratio.",
    "Atomic masses are essential for numerous nuclear astrophysics calculations. The absence of experimental values for pertinent exotic nuclides has spurred the swift advancement of new mass measurement devices globally. Time-of-Flight (TOF) mass measurements serve as a complementary method to the highly precise Penning trap measurements, which are restricted by the rate and half-lives of the ions under study. The NSCL facility offers an optimal setting for TOF mass measurements of extremely exotic nuclei. Recently at this facility, we introduced a TOF-Brho technique and conducted mass measurements of neutron-rich nuclides in the Fe region, which are critical for r-process calculations and for understanding processes in the crust of accreting neutron stars.",
    "Even though super-massive black holes (AGNs) and stellar mass black holes (XRBs) share many features, the broad emission lines (BELs) are a unique signature of AGNs. According to data from the SDSS, it appears there aren't any AGNs with a mass less than about 10^5 times the mass of our sun. \n\nIn this paper, we explore whether these low-mass black holes truly don't exist or if they simply go undetected because they don't produce BELs efficiently. By examining the ionizing spectral energy distribution across a range of black hole masses—from 10 to 10^9 times the mass of our sun, covering XRBs to AGNs—we calculated the equivalent widths (EWs) of several ultraviolet and optical lines: Lyα 1216 Å, Hβ 4861 Å, CIV 1549 Å, and MgII 2798 Å. \n\nWe used the LOC (locally optimally emitting cloud) model to describe the broad emission line region (BELR) for these calculations. Our findings indicate that the hardening of the spectral energy distribution with decreasing black hole mass does not reduce the BEL EWs. Instead, the production of these emission lines is regulated by the finite size of the BELR, dictated by the black hole's mass. \n\nWe noticed a peak in the EWs of emission lines for typical AGN black holes around 10^8 times the mass of the sun. Below this mass, the lines become significantly fainter, with a sharp drop-off occurring below around 10^6 times the mass of the sun. This sharp decline might explain why low-mass AGNs are missing in the SDSS data.",
    "For the first time ever, we've tested the precision of synchronization algorithms inspired by pulse-coupled oscillators on FPGA-based radios. And guess what? The results are impressive! These algorithms can achieve precision in the low microsecond range when implemented right in the physical layer. But that's not all—we've taken it a step further by introducing an extension to the algorithm that accounts for phase rate deviations in the hardware. With this upgrade, we’re seeing precision improve to below one microsecond!\n\nWhat does this mean in the real world? Our super-precise algorithm is perfect for ad hoc wireless systems, where it can handle fully distributed synchronization of transmission slots or sleep cycles. This is especially useful when there's no way to have centralized synchronization. It's a game-changer for making sure everything stays in sync, even in the most challenging and dynamic wireless environments.",
    "Human Trajectory Prediction (HTP) has garnered significant attention in recent years, leading to the development of numerous solutions. Proper benchmarking is crucial for comparing different methods. This paper tackles the challenge of evaluating the complexity of datasets in relation to the prediction problem. To assess dataset complexity, we define a series of indicators based on three key concepts: Trajectory Predictability, Trajectory Regularity, and Context Complexity. We analyze the most commonly used HTP datasets using these indicators and discuss the implications for benchmarking HTP algorithms. Our source code is available on GitHub.",
    "This paper aims to demonstrate how classical linear stochastic systems can be built using quantum optical components. Quantum optical systems offer higher bandwidth than electronic devices, resulting in faster response and processing times, and potentially better performance.

    "Systems biology leverages extensive networks of biochemical reactions to simulate the operations of biological cells, ranging from the molecular level to the entire cell. The behavior of dissipative reaction networks with numerous distinct timescales can be depicted as a series of successive equilibrations of various subsets of the system's variables. For polynomial systems with distinct timescales, equilibrations occur when at least two opposing monomials are of the same order of magnitude and overshadow the others. These equilibrations, along with the resulting simplified dynamics achieved by disregarding the less significant terms, are naturally expressed through tropical analysis and are useful for model simplification.",
    "We analyzed the Suzaku data from the galactic disk and outflow areas of the starburst galaxy M82. For the central disk regions, our thermal modeling showed the need for at least three different temperature components. Interestingly, the Ly$\\beta$ line fluxes for O VIII and Ne X were higher than what we'd expect from a plasma in collisional ionization equilibrium. The Ly$\\beta$/Ly$\\alpha$ line ratios for these elements were also elevated, hinting at the presence of charge exchange.\n\nIn the outflow wind region, we found that the spectra fit well with two-temperature thermal models, and we were able to determine the metal abundances of O, Ne, Mg, and Fe there. The ratios of O/Fe, Ne/Fe, and Mg/Fe were approximately 2, 3, and 2 times the solar values reported by Lodders (2003). Since there's no sign of charge exchange in the outflow region, these metal abundances are likely more accurate compared to those in the central region. This pattern suggests that the starburst activity in M82 is enriching the outflow by ejecting metals from SN II into intergalactic space.",
    "Dust grains are usually believed to form in the winds of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. However, more evidence now suggests that dust also forms in supernovae (SNe). To understand which source is more important for dust formation, we need to know how much newly-formed dust in SN ejecta can survive the reverse shock and enter the interstellar medium.\n\nWe have developed a new code called GRASH_Rev that tracks the dust evolution during a supernova explosion until the forward shock merges with the surrounding interstellar medium. We studied four well-known supernovae in the Milky Way and Large Magellanic Cloud: SN1987A, CasA, the Crab Nebula, and N49. Our models match observations well, and we estimate that 1 to 8% of the observed dust mass survives. This results in a SN dust production rate of $(3.9 \\pm 3.7) \\times 10^{-4}$ M$_{\\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ in the Milky Way. This rate is ten times higher than the dust production rate by AGB stars, but it is not enough to make up for the dust destroyed by SNe, meaning that dust must also be forming in the gas phase.",
    "This study delves into strategies for the hatching process in additive manufacturing with an electron beam, employing numerical simulations. The essential physical model and the associated three-dimensional thermal free surface lattice Boltzmann method used in the simulation software are briefly outlined. The software has been previously validated through experiments with beam power up to 1.2 kW by hatching a cuboid using a basic process strategy. The results were categorized into 'porous', 'good', and 'uneven' based on relative density and surface smoothness. In this study, we explore the limitations of this basic process strategy at higher beam powers and scanning velocities to harness the future potential of high-power electron beam guns up to 10 kW. We subsequently propose modified process strategies that overcome these limitations, aiming to construct the part as quickly as possible while ensuring it is fully dense with a smooth top surface. These strategies are designed to minimize build time and costs, optimize beam power usage, and fully exploit the capabilities of high-power electron beam guns.",
    "Bayesian optimization (BO) represents a distinguished category of global optimization algorithms, particularly adept at minimizing costly objective functions with a minimal number of function evaluations. Traditionally, BO budgets are quantified in terms of iterations, thereby inherently gauging convergence through iteration count and presuming uniformity in evaluation costs. However, in practical scenarios, evaluation costs can vary across different regions of the search space. For instance, the computational expense associated with training neural networks scales quadratically with the size of the layers, a common hyperparameter. Cost-aware BO addresses this by employing alternative cost metrics such as time, energy, or monetary expenditure, areas where standard BO methodologies prove inadequate.\n\nWe propose Cost Apportioned Bayesian Optimization (CArBO), an innovative approach designed to minimize an objective function while incurring the least possible cost. CArBO integrates a cost-effective initial design with a cost-cooled optimization phase, which systematically reduces reliance on a learned cost model as iterations progress. In a comparative analysis involving 20 black-box function optimization problems, CArBO demonstrated superior performance by identifying significantly more optimal hyperparameter configurations within the confines of an equivalent cost budget, outperforming existing competing methods.",
    "This work introduces a combined robotic system with a legged robot and a flying robot that work together for mapping and exploring. The legged robot has good movement on rough terrain and can last a long time, while the flying robot can be deployed from the legged robot to explore hard-to-reach places. The flying robot can navigate in 3D and handle tasks that the ground robot can't. Both robots share maps and plan their own exploration paths. The legged robot has a special method to decide when to release the flying robot. Tests show that this combined system can explore areas that each robot alone could not reach.",
    "We propose polarizing antiprotons in a storage ring using a parallel-moving polarized positron beam. At a relative velocity of $v/c \\approx 0.002$, the spin-flip cross section reaches approximately $2 \\cdot 10^{13}$ barns, according to new QED calculations. We present two methods to achieve a sufficient positron flux density:\n\n1. A radioactive $^{11}$C dc-source, which provides a polarized positron beam with 0.70 polarization and a flux density of about $1.5 \\cdot 10^{10}$/(mm$^2$ s).\n2. Positron production via pair creation using circularly polarized photons, yielding 0.76 polarization and requiring injection into a small storage ring.\n\nThese polarizer sources can be utilized in storage rings at both low (100 MeV) and high (1 GeV) energies, enabling polarization build-up of roughly $10^{10}$ antiprotons to 0.18 within about an hour. Compared to other methods, this approach offers a tenfold improvement in the figure-of-merit.",
    "Loops play a crucial role in the secondary structures of folded DNA and RNA molecules, becoming more prevalent near the melting transition. By applying a theory that incorporates the logarithmic entropy c ln m for loops of length m, we investigate homopolymeric single-stranded nucleic acid chains under varying external forces and temperatures. In the thermodynamic limit for a long chain, a phase transition is revealed between a compact (folded) structure at low temperature and force, and a molten (unfolded) structure at higher temperature and force. The effects of the loop exponent c on phase diagrams, critical exponents, melting, and force-extension curves are analytically derived. Without any pulling force, a melting transition occurs only within the specific range of loop exponents 2 < c < 2.479; at c <= 2, the chain remains in the folded phase, and at 2.479 < c, it stays in the unfolded phase. Singular behavior with a force-induced melting transition is possible for all loop exponents c < 2.479, observable via single molecule force spectroscopy. These insights have significant implications for the hybridization or denaturation of double-stranded nucleic acids. The Poland-Scheraga model for duplex melting in nucleic acids does not account for base pairing within the same strand in denatured regions. If the sequence permits intra-strand base pairs, we demonstrate that a realistic loop exponent c ~ 2.1 leads to prominent secondary structures in the single strands. This results in a lower duplex melting temperature than predicted by the Poland-Scheraga model. Additionally, these secondary structures modify the effective loop exponent c^, which influences the characteristics of denatured regions within the double strand, thereby affecting the universal aspects of the duplex melting transition.",
    "We investigate the Zeeman spin-splitting in hole quantum wires oriented along the [011] and [01̅1] crystallographic directions within a high-mobility, undoped, (100)-oriented AlGaAs/GaAs heterostructure. Our findings indicate that the spin-splitting can be toggled 'on' (finite $g^*$) or 'off' (zero $g^*$) by rotating the magnetic field from a parallel to a perpendicular alignment relative to the wire. The wire exhibits identical properties for both crystallographic orientations. Additionally, we observe that the $g$-factor in the parallel orientation diminishes as the wire is narrowed. This behavior contrasts with that of electron quantum wires, where the $g$-factor is augmented by exchange effects as the wire becomes narrower. This disparity underscores the $k$-dependent Zeeman splitting due to the spin-3/2 nature of holes.",
    "Drawing an analogy with real Clifford algebras on vector spaces of even dimensions, one can assign pairs of space and time dimensions modulo 8 to any algebra (represented over a complex Hilbert space) that includes two self-adjoint involutions and an anti-unitary operator with specified commutation relations. This assignment is shown to be compatible with the tensor product: the space and time dimensions of the tensor product are the sums of those dimensions from its components. Such an assignment may help interpret the role of these algebras in PT-symmetric Hamiltonians or topological matter descriptions. This framework is utilized to develop an indefinite (pseudo-Riemannian) version of the spectral triples found in noncommutative geometry, defined using Krein spaces instead of Hilbert spaces. Through this framework, we can articulate the Lagrangian, encompassing both bosonic and fermionic aspects, for a Lorentzian almost-commutative spectral triple. Additionally, we identify a physical state space that addresses the fermion-doubling problem. As an illustration, quantum electrodynamics is discussed.",
    "We analyze the space-time symmetries of actions derived by expanding the action for a massive free relativistic particle around the Galilean action framework. By operating within canonical space, we identify all the point space-time symmetries relevant to these post-Galilean actions. Additionally, we create an infinite series of generalized Schrödinger algebras, which are defined by an integer $M$. Notably, when $M=0$, this series corresponds to the conventional Schrödinger algebra. Furthermore, we discuss the Schrödinger equations linked to these algebras, explore their solutions, and examine the associated projective phases.",
    "Accretion disc theory isn't as developed as stellar evolution theory yet, although we're aiming for a similarly detailed understanding. Thanks to the interplay between theory and numerical simulations, there's growing awareness in the community about the important role of magnetic fields in angular momentum transport. However, we still face the ongoing challenge of translating insights from simulations into practical models that can be compared with observations. \n\nIt's crucial to more accurately incorporate the role of non-local transport in our models. To highlight where large-scale transport fits into the theoretical framework and what's currently missing, we'll discuss why the practical Shakura-Sunyaev (1973, SS73) model is essentially a mean field theory that doesn't account for large-scale transport. Observations of coronae and jets, along with results from shearing box simulations of the magnetorotational instability (MRI), indicate that a significant portion of disc transport is actually non-local. \n\nWe'll demonstrate that in the saturated state, Maxwell stresses are primarily driven by large-scale effects, and the physics of MRI transport aren't fully represented by a simple viscosity model. We'll also clarify the standard interpretation of MRI in the context of shearing boxes. \n\nSo far, computational limitations have led us to focus mostly on local simulations, but the next generation of global simulations should help us develop better mean field theories. Ideally, mean field accretion theory and mean field dynamo theory should be unified into a single theory that can predict the time evolution of spectra and luminosity from distinct disc, corona, and outflow contributions. Finally, it's important to acknowledge that any mean field theory has a finite level of predictive precision that must be quantified when comparing predictions to observations.",
    "This paper explores the global well-posedness of two Diffuse Interface systems modeling incompressible two-phase fluid motion with capillarity effects in a bounded smooth domain $\\Omega\\subset \\mathbb{R}^d$, $d=2,3$. We examine the dissipation from mass-conserving Allen-Cahn dynamics using the Flory-Huggins potential. Specifically, we study the mass-conserving Navier-Stokes-Allen-Cahn system for nonhomogeneous fluids and the Euler-Allen-Cahn system for homogeneous fluids. We establish the existence and uniqueness of global weak and strong solutions and their separation from pure states. Our analysis utilizes energy and entropy estimates, a novel end-point estimate, a new Stokes problem estimate with non-constant viscosity, and logarithmic Gronwall arguments.",
    "We provide clear formulas for Fock-space projection operators that match realistic final states in scattering experiments. These operators inherently sum over unobserved particles and consider the absence of emission in specific momentum space regions.",
    "In this presentation, we explore the mathematical frameworks linked to Feynman graphs. These graphs form the foundation for computations in perturbative quantum field theory. Beyond their intrinsic mathematical appeal, these structures enable the development of algorithms for calculating Feynman diagrams. We will delve into how Feynman integrals relate to periods, shuffle algebras, and multiple polylogarithms.",
    "We proudly present groundbreaking calculations of the generalized parton distributions (GPDs) of the photon under conditions of non-zero momentum transfer in both transverse and longitudinal directions. By applying sophisticated Fourier transforms to these GPDs, we have successfully mapped the photon’s parton distributions into position space, opening new frontiers for understanding its internal structure.",
    "Transformers excel in sequence modeling but have efficiency issues due to storing all historical token-level representations. We introduce Memformer, an efficient neural network for sequence modeling that uses an external dynamic memory to encode and retrieve past information. Our model processes long sequences with linear time complexity and constant memory space complexity. We also propose memory replay back-propagation (MRBP), an optimization scheme that enables long-range back-propagation with significantly reduced memory requirements. Experimental results demonstrate that Memformer performs comparably to baselines while using 8.1x less memory and being 3.2x faster in inference. Analysis shows that our external memory slots effectively encode and retain important information over time.",
    "We calculate the leading logarithmic behavior of the cross-section for the production of a pseudoscalar Higgs boson through gluon-gluon fusion to all orders in perturbation theory, assuming a large partonic center-of-mass energy. Additionally, we determine the Higgs rapidity distribution with the same level of precision. Our analysis accounts for the contributions of both top and bottom quarks, including their interference. Results are presented in the form of single and double integrals, which have been explicitly evaluated up to the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO). We utilize our findings to refine the known NNLO inclusive cross-section computed within the effective theory where the fermions in the loop are integrated out. The impact of finite fermion mass effects on the inclusive cross-section is found to be minimal, amounting to only a few percent for large values of the pseudoscalar mass.",
    "Identifying outliers in probability distributions can be challenging. For instance, in enforcing the Voting Rights Act, we aim to maximize majority-minority districts in a political districting plan. An unbiased random walk through districting plans rarely finds near-optimal plans. A common approach is a biased random walk, favoring plans with more majority-minority districts. We propose a third method called \"short bursts,\" where an unbiased random walk runs for a few steps (burst length) and restarts from the most extreme plan encountered. Our empirical evidence shows that short bursts outperform biased random walks in maximizing majority-minority districts, with many effective burst lengths. Beyond this specific case, we examine short bursts in various probability distributions and explore their performance in more complex state spaces.",
    "We present a fresh perspective on the wetting properties of graphitic surfaces using molecular dynamics simulations with commercially available non-ionic surfactants, featuring long hydrophilic chains and linear or T-shaped structures, at concentrations ranging from 1-8 wt%. These surfactants are as long as 160 [\\AA]. Achieving accurate molecular dynamics simulations of these systems demands a large number of solvent particles, making coarse-grained models essential for maintaining computational efficiency. The MARTINI force field, which incorporates polarizable water, is particularly well-suited for parameterizing our systems. This model stands out for its ability to explore extended time scales more rapidly and its broad applicability. Despite occasional doubts about its accuracy, our findings show that the wetting properties determined using pure water are consistent with those from atomistic models and theoretical predictions. However, bulk properties of various aqueous surfactant solutions suggest an exaggerated micellar formation process. Therefore, to closely mimic experimental configurations, it is better to prepare droplets with surfactants pre-arranged near the contact line. While cross-comparisons offer valuable insights, the equilibrium contact angles from simulations tend to overestimate experimental results. Nonetheless, our study provides useful guidelines for the preliminary assessment and screening of surfactants.",
    "We review recent experiments that investigate superfluid $^3$He confined in precisely controlled nanofluidic sample chambers. We address the experimental challenges and how they were overcome. These methods pave the way for systematic studies of $^3$He film superfluidity, as well as the surface and edge excitations of topological superfluids.",
    "Code-mixed machine translation is increasingly vital in multilingual communities, expanding traditional machine translation to accommodate mixed-language data. In the WMT 2022 shared tasks, we addressed English-Hindi to Hinglish and Hinglish to English translation challenges. The first task involved both Roman and Devanagari scripts, leveraging monolingual data from both English and Hindi, while the second task used only Roman script data. Remarkably, we achieved leading ROUGE-L and WER scores for the Monolingual to Code-Mixed translation task. This paper delves into our use of mBART, including special pre-processing and transliteration from Devanagari to Roman, for the first task, and details our experiments on translating code-mixed Hinglish to monolingual English.",
    "Contrastive learning offers significant promise in self-supervised spatio-temporal representation learning. Typically, various methods construct positive and negative pairs by simply sampling different clips. However, this approach tends to bias the model towards background scenes. This bias emerges primarily for two reasons: first, scene differences are often more apparent and easier to identify than motion differences; second, clips from the same video frequently have similar backgrounds but varying motions. Treating such clips as positive pairs mainly attracts the model to the static background instead of the motion patterns. To address this issue, we propose a novel dual contrastive formulation. Specifically, we separate the input RGB video sequence into static scene and dynamic motion components. We then align the original RGB features with the corresponding static and dynamic features. This approach allows the static scene and dynamic motion to be encoded simultaneously into a compact RGB representation. We further enhance this by decoupling the feature space through activation maps to isolate static- and dynamic-related features. We call our method Dual Contrastive Learning for spatio-temporal Representation (DCLR). Extensive experiments indicate that DCLR effectively learns spatio-temporal representations and achieves state-of-the-art or comparable performance on the UCF-101, HMDB-51, and Diving-48 datasets.",
    "Using the FLAPW and LSDA+U methods, we calculated the electronic band structure and Fermi surfaces of ferromagnetic CeRh3B2. We propose a fully orbital- and spin-polarized state |lz=0, sx=1/2> as the ground state to describe the 4f electronic state, instead of the typically expected LS-coupled CEF ground state for 4f compounds. This proposal is supported by the fact that the calculated electronic structure and Fermi surfaces explain both the observed magnetic moment and the observed dHvA frequencies. The unconventional ground state is stabilized by strong 4f-4f direct mixing between neighboring Ce atoms along the c-axis, which has an extremely small distance in the hexagonal crystal cell.",
    "Matrix acidization simulation poses a significant challenge in the study of flows in porous media due to the dynamic changes in porosity during the process. The enhanced DBF framework provides one method for executing this simulation, employing a numerical scheme that discretizes the mass and momentum conservation equations together to create a pressure-velocity linear system. However, this linear system can only be solved using direct solvers to determine pressure and velocity at the same time, because the diagonal of the coefficient matrix contains zeros. Given the large-scale nature of matrix acidization simulation, the solving time with direct solvers can be prohibitive. Consequently, this work proposes a decoupled scheme to separate the coupled pressure-velocity linear system into two independent linear systems: one for solving pressure and another for solving velocity. Both new linear systems are amenable to parallel and iterative solvers, ensuring that large-scale simulations can be completed within a reasonable timeframe. A numerical experiment is conducted to verify the accuracy of the decoupled scheme and its superior computational efficiency.",
    "Sensemaking and narrative are inherently interconnected in how people understand the world. Sensemaking involves structuring and linking new information with past knowledge and inferences. Narratives, created through sensemaking, provide a holistic view of the world that surpasses any single piece of information. Both concepts are crucial for human understanding and would be valuable for computational systems aiming to mimic this process. In this paper, we explore how sensemaking and narrative theories help people build their worldviews based on encountered information and examine the connections between these fields of research. We spotlight visual storytelling as a computational task that can benefit from incorporating sensemaking and narrative elements. Finally, we describe our visual storytelling system that leverages these concepts and discuss examples from its current implementation.",
    "Evaluation metrics that aren’t robust to dialect variation make it hard to gauge how well systems perform for different user groups, and can even penalize systems for producing text in less common dialects. Right now, there’s no method to measure how metrics react to changes in dialect for generated text. To address this, we’ve set goals for NLG evaluation metrics: dialect robustness and dialect awareness. We’ve developed a suite of methods and statistical tests to evaluate metrics based on these goals. When we applied these tools to the latest state-of-the-art metrics, we found they weren't dialect-robust. In fact, semantic changes often resulted in smaller metric drops than when dialect features were introduced. As a step toward solving this, we propose a new training approach called NANO, which incorporates regional and language information during the pretraining of metrics. Our tests show that NANO efficiently enhances dialect robustness and boosts performance on standard metric benchmarks.",
    "Geographic routing uses node positions to aid routing, and is well-studied in sensor networks. The main challenge is its practicality; existing methods rely on unverifiable assumptions or expensive graph planarization. This paper addresses when and how to use geographic routing, and introduces four principles that define it. We measure a network's suitability for geographic routing through geographic eccentricity, and propose a distributed algorithm to enable geographic routing or demonstrate its infeasibility.",
    "In our study, we reveal that the spatial variation and correlation of superconductivity fluctuations in a two-band model are governed by two distinct characteristic lengths. This creates a much more intricate picture than in one-band systems. Notably, short-range correlations persist in a two-band scenario, even as the system approaches the phase transition point.",
    "We introduce cutting-edge online prediction techniques for time series analysis that adeptly manage nonstationary elements like trends and seasonality, common in most real-world datasets. By implementing specific transformations prior to making predictions, we demonstrate substantial enhancements in both theoretical and empirical performance. Recognizing the challenge of identifying these transformations, we leverage a learning with experts framework to create a fully online approach named NonSTOP (NonSTationary Online Prediction) for forecasting nonstationary time series.\n\nThis innovative methodology accommodates seasonal patterns and other trends in univariate time series as well as cointegration in multivariate scenarios. Our proposed algorithms and associated regret analysis not only encompass but also extend recent advancements, greatly broadening their practical applications. We support each method with provable sub-linear regret bounds under relaxed conditions. To address the theoretical limitations in capturing the full benefits of our transformations, we conduct a data-driven analysis using the follow-the-leader algorithm, which provides deeper insights into the efficacy of these transformations.\n\nOur comprehensive suite of experiments, involving both simulated and real-world data, substantiates all our theoretical claims and underscores the robust performance of our proposed methods.",
    "We propose a new way to tackle the complex issue of determining if a logic program will stop running, which neither proves nor disproves termination directly. Our method predicts if a program will end when other methods fail. We describe how to identify endless sequences of logic steps for any query type and create an algorithm to predict program termination when queries don’t get stuck. Our tool for predicting termination has performed well in tests. Out of 301 benchmark programs, it was fully accurate for 296, including 18 that other advanced tools couldn't analyze.",
    "The theoretical properties of random forests remain poorly understood despite their widespread use. This paper contributes to the understanding by introducing a new, theoretically tractable variant of random regression forests and proving its consistency. Additionally, we empirically compare our algorithm and other tractable models to the commonly used random forest algorithm, offering insights into the significance of simplifications made for theoretical analysis.",
    "Factorial Hidden Markov Models (FHMMs) are effective for sequential data but struggle with long sequences. We introduce a scalable inference and learning algorithm for FHMMs, inspired by concepts from stochastic variational inference, neural networks, and copula theory. Unlike current methods, our algorithm eliminates the need for message passing among latent variables and can be distributed across multiple computers to expedite learning. Our experiments confirm that this algorithm does not add further approximation bias compared to the established structured mean-field algorithm and performs better with long sequences and large FHMMs.",
    "In this study, scientists have conducted molecular dynamics simulations on pure liquid water, sodium chloride aqueous solutions, and polymer solutions subjected to a strong external electric field to understand how they structurally respond. They employed various simulation techniques to uncover the molecular processes that create liquid bridges and jets, crucial in producing nanofibers. The findings reveal that, in the nanoscale structures formed, molecules align their dipole moments parallel to the applied field across the entire sample volume. However, the presence of ions can disrupt this alignment, eventually breaking the structure down into droplets. The study also determined the concentration-dependent threshold field necessary to stabilize a liquid column. Additionally, polymer conformational changes during the jetting process were observed.",
    "Recommender systems are increasingly employed to predict and deliver content that aligns with user preferences. However, matching new users with relevant content remains a significant challenge. Podcasting, an emergent medium experiencing rapid growth in adoption, presents unique obstacles when traditional recommendation methods are applied to tackle the cold-start problem. By leveraging music consumption behavior, we explore two primary techniques for inferring Spotify users' preferences across more than 200,000 podcasts. Our findings demonstrate substantial improvements in content consumption, with increases of up to 50% observed in both offline and online experiments. We conduct an extensive analysis of model performance and investigate the extent to which using music data as an input source introduces bias into the recommendations.",
    "We compute the Casimir energy and entropy for two ideal metal spheres, considering both large and small separation limits. Our results show that the Helmholtz free energy exhibits nonmonotonic behavior with respect to separation distance and temperature, resulting in certain conditions where the entropy is negative. Additionally, the entropy displays nonmonotonic behavior relative to both temperature and the distance between the spheres. We discuss the emergence of these unusual entropy behaviors and their implications for thermodynamics.",
    "Many important real-world problems have action spaces that are high-dimensional, continuous, or both, making it infeasible to fully enumerate all possible actions. Therefore, only small subsets of actions can be sampled for policy evaluation and improvement. In this paper, we introduce a general framework for principled policy evaluation and improvement over such sampled action subsets. This sample-based policy iteration framework can be applied to any reinforcement learning algorithm based on policy iteration. Specifically, we propose Sampled MuZero, an extension of the MuZero algorithm that learns in domains with complex action spaces by planning over sampled actions. We demonstrate this approach on the classical board game of Go and two continuous control benchmark domains: DeepMind Control Suite and Real-World RL Suite.",
    "In this paper, we introduce two novel mask-based beamforming methods leveraging deep neural networks (DNNs) trained with multichannel loss functions. Beamforming techniques that utilize time-frequency (TF) masks, estimated by a DNN, have been widely applied in various applications to estimate spatial covariance matrices. Traditionally, DNNs for mask-based beamforming have been trained using loss functions tailored for monaural speech enhancement or separation. While these training criteria are straightforward, they do not directly correlate with the performance of mask-based beamforming.\n\nTo address this limitation, we employ multichannel loss functions that evaluate the estimated spatial covariance matrices using the multichannel Itakura-Saito divergence. DNNs trained with these multichannel loss functions can then be leveraged to construct a variety of beamformers. Experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness and robustness of these methodologies across different microphone configurations, validating their practical utility.",
    "Nano-FTIR imaging is an advanced scanning technique that provides nanometer spatial resolution by combining Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM). However, capturing large spatial areas with nano-FTIR is hindered by lengthy measurement times due to its sequential data collection process. To address this issue, several mathematical approaches have been proposed, all of which require only a small portion of randomly selected measurements. Nonetheless, randomly selecting measurements presents practical difficulties for scanning procedures and does not significantly reduce measurement times. We explore various practically relevant sub-sampling techniques that ensure quicker acquisition. It is demonstrated that the results from almost all considered sub-sampling methods—namely original Lissajous, triangle Lissajous, and random reflection sub-sampling at a 10% rate—are comparable to those obtained using a random 10% sub-sampling. This indicates that random sub-sampling is not necessary for efficient data acquisition.",
    "We analyze screening masses in the deconfined phase of the (3+1)d SU(3) pure gauge theory at finite temperature near the phase transition, using Polyakov loop correlators. This is done for two distinct channels of angular momentum and parity. We then compare their ratio to that of massive excitations with identical quantum numbers in the 3d 3-state Potts model in its broken phase near the transition point at zero magnetic field. Additionally, we examine the inverse decay length of the correlations between the real parts and the imaginary parts of the Polyakov loop. Our findings are then juxtaposed with predictions from perturbation theory and mean-field Polyakov loop models.",
    "The Mahalanobis distance-based confidence score, an advanced anomaly detection method for pre-trained neural classifiers, excels in detecting out-of-distribution (OoD) and adversarial examples. This work explores why it performs so well despite assuming that class conditional distributions of pre-trained features have tied covariance—an implausible assumption. Although it is claimed to be based on classification prediction confidence, its superior performance actually relies on different information. This insight reveals that the Mahalanobis score's effectiveness is misunderstood and distinct from ODIN, another method based on prediction confidence. Consequently, we combined the two methods, resulting in improved performance and robustness. These findings enhance our understanding of neural classifiers' responses to anomalous inputs.",
    "Algorithms for differentiating functional expressions manipulate the syntax of mathematical expressions in a meaningful way. Formalizing such an algorithm requires specifying its computational behavior, mathematical meaning, and a mechanism for application. This involves integrating syntax reasoning with semantic understanding. A syntax framework is an abstract model that maps expressions to their syntactic structures, provides a reasoning language, a quotation mechanism for syntactic values, and an evaluation mechanism for their actual values. We compare two approaches for formalizing a syntax-based mathematical algorithm in a formal theory T. The first approach uses inductive type members in T for syntactic values, with quotation and evaluation defined in the metatheory of T. The second approach represents every expression in T as a syntactic value, with quotation and evaluation as operators within T itself.",
    "This paper dives into the fascinating world of two interacting consumer-resource pairs, modeled with chemostat-like equations! What's intriguing is the assumption that the resource dynamics are significantly slower than those of the consumers. This contrasting pace opens up the exciting possibility for an in-depth analysis. By treating consumers and resources in the coupled system as fast-scale and slow-scale variables, respectively, we can explore their behaviors in phase planes as though they're independent. \n\nWhen considered separately, each pair reaches a unique, stable equilibrium without self-sustained oscillations—although some damped oscillations around this equilibrium are allowed. But, here’s where it gets really exciting: when these consumer-resource pairs are weakly coupled through direct reciprocal inhibition of consumers, the entire system starts to exhibit self-sustained relaxation oscillations! And these oscillations can have periods way longer than the intrinsic relaxation time of either pair. \n\nThe elegance of the model lies in its versatility—it accurately encapsulates the dynamics of locally linked consumer-resource systems of vastly different natures. Imagine living populations engaged in interspecific interference competition, or even lasers coupled through their cavity losses. This study promises to illuminate the intricate and dynamic interplay within these complex systems!",
    "Wi-Fi networks still have a big difference in performance among different users when uploading data, mostly due to varying signal quality. To tackle this, protocols like CoopMAC were introduced. This study shows that using these cooperative protocols means there's a balance between throughput (how much data is sent) and bit-cost (energy used per bit). This balance depends on how much cooperation is involved. For networks based on carrier sense multiple access (CSMA), we've worked out the theoretical balance curve between throughput and bit-cost. We've also come up with a new distributed CSMA protocol named fairMAC, and theoretically, fairMAC can reach any point on this balance curve when packet sizes are very large. This theory is backed up by Monte Carlo simulations.",
    "Social tagging has emerged as a compelling method for enhancing search and navigation on the modern Web by collaboratively aggregating tags from different users for the same resource. This process generates a list of weighted tags that describe the resource. When combined with traditional taxonomic classification systems, such as that used by Wikipedia, social tags can significantly improve document navigation and search capabilities. Social tags facilitate alternative navigation methods, including pivot-browsing, popularity-driven navigation, and filtering. Additionally, they provide new metadata, sometimes not evident from the document content itself, thereby enhancing search efficiency. This work suggests the integration of an interface for adding user-defined tags to describe Wikipedia articles, aiming to enhance navigation and retrieval. As a result, a prototype implementing tags on Wikipedia is proposed for evaluating its effectiveness.",
    "Quantum Computing, particularly Quantum Machine Learning, has rapidly captured the interest of research groups worldwide. This rising interest is evidenced by the growing number of proposed models for pattern classification that apply quantum principles. Despite this increase, there remains a gap in testing these models on real datasets rather than just synthetic ones. The aim of this work is to classify patterns with binary attributes using a quantum classifier, particularly focusing on image datasets. Our experiments demonstrate promising results in handling both balanced classification problems and imbalanced classes where the minority class is most relevant. This potential is especially significant in medical fields, where the minority class often holds the most importance.",
    "We present a fresh look at near- and mid-infrared observations of the shock-cloud interaction region in the southern part of the supernova remnant HB 21. These observations were conducted using the InfraRed Camera (IRC) aboard the AKARI satellite and the Wide InfraRed Camera (WIRC) at the Palomar 5-meter telescope. The IRC images in the 4 um (N4), 7 um (S7), and 11 um (S11) bands, as well as the WIRC H2 v=1->0 S(1) 2.12 um image, reveal similar diffuse structures around a shocked CO cloud. By comparing the observed emissions with various shock models of H2 line emission, we find that the IRC colors align well with the thermal admixture model for H2 gas. This model suggests an infinitesimal H2 column density in a power-law relationship with temperature, $dN\\sim T^{-b}dT$, with parameters n(H2) $\\sim3.9\\times10^4$ cm^{-2$, $b\\sim4.2$, and N(H2;T>100K) $\\sim2.8\\times10^{21}$ cm^{-2$. We evaluated these parameters through different scenarios of shock-cloud interactions—including multiple planar C-shocks, bow shocks, and shocked clumps—and discussed their respective strengths and weaknesses. Intriguingly, the observed H2 v=1->0 S(1) intensity is four times higher than what the power-law admixture model predicts, echoing results found in the northern part of HB 21 (as noted in Paper I). Lastly, we examined the limitations of the thermal admixture model concerning the derived parameters and their implications.",
    "Vision transformers have recently demonstrated impressive results, outpacing large convolutional models. However, for smaller models used in mobile or resource-constrained devices, ConvNets still excel in performance and complexity. We introduce ParC-Net, a ConvNet-based model that enhances these strengths by incorporating features of vision transformers. Specifically, we present position-aware circular convolution (ParC), a lightweight convolution operation with a global receptive field that retains location-sensitive features. We integrate ParC with squeeze-excitation operations to create a model block with transformer-like attention mechanisms. This block can be used to replace existing blocks in ConvNets or transformers. Experiments show that ParC-Net outperforms popular lightweight ConvNets and vision transformer-based models in various vision tasks with fewer parameters and faster inference speeds. For ImageNet-1k classification, ParC-Net achieves 78.6% top-1 accuracy with 5 million parameters, saving 11% on parameters and 13% on computational cost, while achieving 0.2% higher accuracy and 23% faster inference speed compared to MobileViT. It also uses half the parameters but gains 2.7% higher accuracy compared to DeIT. ParC-Net also performs better on MS-COCO object detection and PASCAL VOC segmentation tasks. Source code is available at https://github.com/hkzhang91/ParC-Net",
    "By solving the equation $x^n - x + t = 0$ for $n=2,3,4$ and expressing the solutions with hypergeometric functions, we derive a collection of reduction formulas for hypergeometric functions. Through differentiating and integrating these results, alongside using established reduction formulas for hypergeometric functions, we generate new reduction formulas for special functions and calculate certain infinite integrals using elementary functions.",
    "Air-gap covert channels represent unique forms of covert communication that allow attackers to extract data from isolated, offline computers. Over the years, several kinds of such channels have been demonstrated, including electromagnetic, magnetic, acoustic, optical, and thermal methods. In this paper, we unveil a novel type of vibrational (seismic) covert channel. Our observations reveal that computers emit vibrations at frequencies corresponding to the rotation speeds of their internal fans. These imperceptible vibrations influence the entire surface on which the computer rests. Our approach leverages malware to manipulate the vibrations produced by a computer, by adjusting its internal fan speeds. We demonstrate that the covert vibrations generated by the malware can be detected by nearby smartphones through their built-in accelerometers. Remarkably, these smartphone accelerometer sensors can be accessed by any app without needing user permissions, making this attack particularly stealthy. We developed AiR-ViBeR, a malware that encodes binary data and transmits it over a low-frequency vibrational carrier. A malicious application on a smartphone placed on the same surface (e.g., a desk) then decodes the data. We discuss the attack model, provide technical context, and present the implementation details and evaluation results. Our findings indicate that using AiR-ViBeR, data can be exfiltrated from an air-gapped computer to a nearby smartphone on the same or even an adjacent table through vibrations. Finally, we suggest a series of countermeasures to address this new type of attack.",
    "Using a numerical model, the total cost of operating a magnetic refrigerator with a 25 W average load, employing commercial grade Gadolinium (Gd), is assessed. This calculation takes into account the expenses for magnetocaloric material, magnet material, and operational costs, all of which contribute to the overall expenditure. For a device lifespan of 15 years, the total combined cost ranges between $150 and $400, depending on the market prices of both magnetocaloric and magnet materials. Among these costs, the magnet is the most expensive component, closely followed by operational costs, while the magnetocaloric material incurs minimal costs. \n\nFor the most cost-efficient device, the optimal parameters include a magnetic field of approximately 1.4 Tesla, a particle size of 0.23 mm, a regenerator length of 40-50 mm, and a utilization factor of around 0.2, irrespective of device lifespan, material, and magnet prices. However, the operating frequency varies according to the device lifespan. The performance characteristics assumed are comparable to those of a conventional A+++ rated refrigeration unit. When comparing the lifetime costs of the magnetic refrigeration device to such a conventional unit, the costs are found to be roughly similar, with the magnetic option being slightly more economical, assuming that the cost of the magnet can be recovered at the end of the device's life.",
    "We prove the existence of initial data sets with one asymptotically flat end and one asymptotically cylindrical end, known as trumpets in numerical relativity.",
    "Enzymes are like intricate machines built from proteins, designed to speed up complex chemical reactions in our bodies. Our study shows how a trio of tightly bonded tyrosine molecules in the enzyme ketosteroid isomerase (KSI) helps with a process called quantum proton delocalization, a crucial mechanism for the enzyme's function. By combining hands-on experiments with advanced computer simulations, we discovered that this trio makes one tyrosine much more acidic, meaning it's easier for it to lose a proton. When a molecule that mimics what KSI normally acts on is introduced, it becomes part of this network, further enhancing proton movement. This research highlights the importance of quantum effects in biological systems, especially those with strong hydrogen bonds, helping us understand how enzymes stabilize their reactive intermediates.",
    "In this study, we introduce ENSEI, a secure inference (SI) framework leveraging the frequency-domain secure convolution (FDSC) protocol to facilitate efficient and privacy-preserving visual recognition. We have observed that, by combining homomorphic encryption with secret sharing, homomorphic convolution can be executed privately in the frequency domain, thereby streamlining the associated computations. We detail protocol designs and parameter derivations for number-theoretic transform (NTT) based FDSC. Through our experiments, we extensively analyze the trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency in both time-domain and frequency-domain homomorphic convolution. ENSEI demonstrates substantial improvements over existing methods, achieving a 5 to 11-fold reduction in online time, up to a 33-fold decrease in setup time, and up to a 10-fold decrease in overall inference time. Additionally, we observe a further 33% reduction in bandwidth usage for binary neural networks, with only a minimal 1% accuracy loss on the CIFAR-10 dataset.",
    "Recommender systems help manage the issue of information overload by forecasting our likely preferences among various niche items. A wide range of personalized recommendation algorithms have been developed, most of which rely on similarities, such as collaborative filtering and mass diffusion. In this context, we introduce an innovative vertex similarity metric called CosRA, which merges the strengths of both the cosine index and the resource-allocation (RA) index. When applied to actual recommender systems like MovieLens, Netflix, and RYM, the CosRA-based approach demonstrates superior accuracy, diversity, and novelty compared to some standard methods. Additionally, the CosRA index does not require any parameters, a notable advantage in practical applications. Further experiments indicate that adding two adjustable parameters does not significantly enhance the overall performance of the CosRA index.",
    "With the rising demand for algorithms that can handle rapidly evolving data, numerous real-world scenarios utilize multi-label data streams. When the data distribution shifts—a phenomenon known as concept drift—existing classification models quickly become less effective. To address this, we introduce a new algorithm named Label Dependency Drift Detector (LD3), an unsupervised concept drift detector that uses label dependencies to assist classifiers in multi-label data streams. Our research harnesses the dynamic temporal dependencies between labels through a label influence ranking method, which employs a data fusion algorithm and leverages the resulting ranking to identify concept drift. LD3 is the inaugural unsupervised concept drift detection algorithm specifically for the multi-label classification domain. In this research, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of LD3, benchmarking it against 14 leading supervised concept drift detection algorithms tailored to the multi-label problem, using 12 datasets and a baseline classifier. Our findings reveal that LD3 outperforms comparable detectors by enhancing predictive performance by 19.8% to 68.6% on both real and synthetic data streams.",
    "The universality of the Cepheid Period-Luminosity (PL) relations has been debated due to the potential impact of metallicity on the intercept and slope. This study aims to calibrate the Galactic PL relations across various photometric bands (B to K) and compare them to the established PL relations in the LMC. We use 59 calibrating stars with distances measured by five methods: Hubble Space Telescope and revised Hipparcos parallaxes, infrared surface brightness, interferometric Baade-Wesselink parallaxes, and classical Zero-Age-Main-Sequence-fitting parallaxes for Cepheids in open clusters or OB star associations. We also discuss absorption corrections and the projection factor. Our findings show no significant difference in the PL relation slopes between the LMC and the Milky Way, suggesting universal slopes in all photometric bands across these galaxies. While zero-point variation with metal content is not addressed, our data suggest an upper limit of 18.50 for the LMC distance modulus.",
    "Ensembling methods are great for boosting prediction accuracy, but they have a drawback: they can't effectively tell which component models are the best. In this paper, we're introducing a new approach called stacking with auxiliary features. This method helps combine useful information from multiple systems to enhance performance. The auxiliary features allow the stacker to rely on systems not just based on their agreement on an output, but also on where that output comes from. We tested our approach on three tough and varied problems: the Cold Start Slot Filling, the Tri-lingual Entity Discovery and Linking, and the ImageNet object detection tasks. Our method achieved new state-of-the-art results on the first two tasks and made significant improvements in the detection task, showcasing both its power and versatility.",
    "We introduce a simple and fast method to simulate spin-torque-driven magnetization dynamics in nano-pillar spin-valve structures. This method couples a spin transport code based on random matrix theory with micromagnetics finite-elements software to accurately account for the spatial dependence of both spin transport and magnetization dynamics. Our results align with experimental data, correctly reproducing spin-wave mode excitation, the threshold current for steady-state magnetization precession, and the nonlinear frequency shift of the modes. Additionally, the giant magnetoresistance effect and magnetization switching are consistent with experimental findings. We also discuss the similarities with recently described spin-caloritronics devices.",
    "We propose an uncomplicated technique for calculating hyperbolic Voronoi diagrams of finite point sets as affine diagrams. We demonstrate that bisectors in Klein's non-conformal disk model are hyperplanes, which can be viewed as power bisectors of Euclidean balls. Consequently, our approach involves computing an equivalent clipped power diagram, followed by a mapping transformation based on the chosen representation of hyperbolic space (e.g., Poincaré conformal disk or upper-plane representations). We explore extensions of this method to weighted and $k$-order diagrams and describe their dual triangulations. Lastly, we consider two practical operations on hyperbolic Voronoi diagrams for developing custom user interfaces for an image catalog browsing application in the hyperbolic disk: (1) finding nearest neighbors, and (2) computing smallest enclosing balls.",
    "We delve into the issue of bond dissociation within a double well potential when an external force is applied. By calculating the probability distribution of rupture forces, we provide an in-depth analysis of how finite rebinding probabilities influence the dynamic force spectrum. Our primary focus is on barrier crossing during extension with a linearly increasing load and during relaxation starting from completely separated bonds. At high loading rates, the rupture and rejoining forces depend on the loading rate as expected, based on the potential's shape. Conversely, at low loading rates, the mean forces from both pulling and relaxation converge as equilibrium is approached. We explore how parameters such as cantilever stiffness and the presence of a soft linker affect the rupture force distributions and mean rupture forces. Our findings indicate that the equilibrium rupture force can either remain unchanged by the soft linker or vary predictably with its compliance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the equilibrium constants of the on- and off-rates can be derived from the equilibrium rupture forces.",
    "We're suggesting a robust feature space for detecting regions dominated by viscosity and turbulence, such as boundary layers and wakes. Our approach leverages the principal invariants of strain and rotational rate tensors within an unsupervised Machine Learning Gaussian mixture model. This chosen feature space is coordinate-frame independent because it relies on Galilean invariants, ensuring consistent results. With this method, we can pinpoint two types of flow regions: a viscous-dominated, rotational region (boundary layers and wakes) and an inviscid, irrotational region (outer flow). We've tested this on both laminar and turbulent flows (using Large Eddy Simulation) around a circular cylinder at Reynolds numbers of 40 and 3900, respectively. These simulations utilized a high-order nodal Discontinuous Galerkin Spectral Element Method (DGSEM). Our analysis confirms that Gaussian mixture clustering effectively identifies viscous-dominated and rotational flow regions. Additionally, we compare our results with traditional sensor methods, demonstrating that our clustering approach avoids the arbitrary threshold selection required by conventional sensors.",
    "Engineered quantum systems enable the observation of phenomena otherwise inaccessible in nature. The LEGO-like modularity of superconducting circuits is ideal for constructing and interconnecting artificial atoms. In this work, we present an artificial molecule made of two strongly coupled fluxonium atoms with a tunable magnetic moment. By adjusting an external flux, the molecule can be switched between two regimes: one with a magnetic dipole moment in the ground-excited state manifold and one with only a magnetic quadrupole moment. Variation in the applied external flux reveals that the molecule's coherence is primarily constrained by local flux noise. This capability to engineer and manipulate artificial molecules lays the groundwork for more advanced circuits, facilitating protected qubits and quantum simulations.",
    "We present a method for making time-critical decisions involving sequential tasks and stochastic processes. This method uses several iterative refinement routines to address different aspects of the decision-making problem. This paper focuses on the meta-level control problem of deliberation scheduling, which involves allocating computational resources to these routines. We offer various models that correspond to optimization problems, capturing different scenarios and computational strategies for decision making under time constraints. We examine precursor models, where all decision making occurs before execution, and recurrent models, where decision making happens concurrently with execution, considering the observed states and anticipating future states. We describe algorithms for both precursor and recurrent models and share the results of our empirical investigations.",
    "The role model approach is proposed as a technique for creating an estimator by aiming to match the output of an advanced estimator that benefits from superior input data. This approach is demonstrated to produce the optimal Bayesian estimator under the condition that a Markov property is satisfied. Two examples with basic channels are provided to demonstrate its application. Additionally, the strategy is integrated with time averaging to form a statistical model through the numerical resolution of a convex optimization problem. Initially, the role model approach was developed for designing low complexity decoders for iterative decoding processes. Possible uses beyond the communications sector are also explored.",
    "Computer vision systems often trip up when it comes to recognizing artistically rendered objects, especially when they're working with limited data. What if we could train a system to identify paintings, cartoons, or sketches without needing any labeled data from those styles? Well, that's exactly what we've proposed in this paper! \n\nOur method takes into account the stylistic shifts that occur both within and between different artistic domains. To tackle this, we've devised a complementary training approach that mimics the artistic style of the target domain. By ensuring that the network learns features invariant between the two training setups, we broaden its versatility. \n\nAnd guess what? You don't need a massive dataset to make it work. Using style transfer techniques, we can generate artificial labeled data sources that capture the essence of diverse target styles. Unlike other methods that require big piles of unlabeled data, our approach thrives with as few as ten images!\n\nWe've put our method to the test across various cross-domain object and scene classification tasks, and even introduced a new dataset for evaluation. Our experiments reveal that although our approach is conceptually straightforward, it significantly amps up the accuracy of artistic object recognition compared to existing domain adaptation techniques.",
    "This paper examines the long-term behavior of solutions to semi-linear Cauchy problems with quadratic gradient nonlinearity. The Cauchy problem in question features a general state space that may degenerate at its boundary. Two types of long-term behavior are identified: i) pointwise convergence of the solution and its gradient; ii) convergence of solutions to associated backward stochastic differential equations. When the state space is \\( \\mathbb{R}^d \\) or the space of positive definite matrices, both types of convergence are achieved under certain growth conditions on the model coefficients. These long-term convergence results have direct applications in risk-sensitive control and long-term portfolio selection problems.",
    "The decaying vacuum (DV) model, which treats dark energy as a varying vacuum, has been extensively studied recently. In this model, the vacuum energy decays linearly with the Hubble parameter at late times, $\\rho_\\Lambda(t) \\propto H(t)$, resulting in an additional matter component. We constrain the parameters of the DV model using recent datasets from supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, baryon acoustic oscillations, the cosmic microwave background (CMB), the Hubble rate, and x-ray observations of galaxy clusters. Our findings indicate that the best-fit matter density contrast, $\\Omega_m$, in the DV model is significantly larger than in the $\\Lambda$CDM model. We provide the confidence contours in the $\\Omega_m-h$ plane up to the $3\\sigma$ confidence level, and present the normalized likelihoods of $\\Omega_m$ and $h$ separately.",
    "Perpendicular MgO-based Magnetic Tunnel Junctions are ideal for building Spin Transfer Torque (STT) magnetoresistive memories. However, achieving a switching current density below 10^6 A/cm^2 with STT alone has been challenging. A recent study by Wang et al. (Nature Mater., vol. 11, pp 64-68, Jan. 2012) experimentally demonstrated magnetization switching assisted by an electric field at ultra-low current densities. While previous investigations used a macrospin approach, we present a comprehensive micromagnetic analysis. Our findings reveal that switching involves a complex nucleation process, including the formation of magnetic vortices.",
    "We extend Rosenblatt's traditional perceptron learning algorithm to accommodate proximal activation functions and show that this extension can be understood as an incremental gradient method applied to a novel energy function. This energy function is based on a generalised Bregman distance, and its gradient with respect to the weights and biases does not require differentiating the activation function. Viewing the algorithm as an energy minimisation technique opens up possibilities for numerous new algorithms. Among these, we introduce a new variant of the iterative soft-thresholding algorithm for learning sparse perceptrons.",
    "The radiation force exerted on an object by an acoustic wave has been extensively studied since the pioneering work of Rayleigh, Langevin, and Brillouin. Over the past decade, this research has significantly advanced the field of acoustic micromanipulation. However, current expressions for the acoustic radiation force applied to a particle have only been derived for stationary particles, thus neglecting the effect of their displacement on the radiated wave. In this paper, we investigate the acoustic radiation force on a monopole source moving at a constant velocity that is small compared to the speed of sound. We demonstrate that the Doppler-induced asymmetry in the emitted field generates a radiation force on the source, which acts in the direction opposite to its motion.",
    "Understanding the base of the solar convective envelope is pretty challenging. Even with our first attempts at studying the Sun's rotation, scientists noticed that a small region, called the tachocline, has a massive impact on the Sun's behavior. This area transitions from differential rotation to solid-body rotation, is influenced by turbulence, and is believed to be where the solar magnetic dynamo occurs. However, when we compare our solar models to actual observations, especially the sound speed in this region, there are big differences. In this paper, we show how using helioseismology—a technique that studies waves on the Sun's surface—can give us more clues. We do this by analyzing the Ledoux discriminant. We also look at how different versions of solar models, which use various data about opacities and chemical makeups, match up to what we actually see. Finally, we discuss why there's a gap between our models and the real Sun.",
    "There is a strong interest in modeling and understanding human behavior. Research trends in this field reveal a common belief that human reasoning is often considered the benchmark in artificial reasoning. Consequently, areas like game theory, theory of mind, and machine learning all incorporate concepts that are thought to be fundamental to human reasoning. These areas aim to both replicate and comprehend human behaviors. Additionally, future autonomous and adaptive systems will frequently involve AI agents and humans collaborating as teams. To achieve this, autonomous agents must develop practical models of human behavior, enabling them not only to mimic human models as a learning technique but also to understand user actions and anticipate their behavior, facilitating effective collaboration. The primary goal of this paper is to offer a concise yet comprehensive review of the most significant approaches in two areas that deal with quantitative models of human behavior. Specifically, we examine (i) methods that learn a model or behavior policy through exploration and feedback, like Reinforcement Learning, and (ii) approaches that directly model the mechanisms of human reasoning, such as beliefs and biases, without necessarily relying on trial-and-error learning.",
    "Breaking down botnets has always posed significant challenges. The resilience of command-and-control (C&C) channels has improved, and identifying the botmaster has become more difficult in peer-to-peer (P2P) botnets. In this study, we introduce a probabilistic approach to reconstruct the topologies of the C&C channels for P2P botnets. The geographic dispersion of P2P botnet members prevents the supervision of all members, and the necessary data required for other graph reconstruction methods is often unavailable. To date, no universal method has been developed to reconstruct the C&C channel topology for all types of P2P botnets.\n\nOur approach estimates the probability of connections between bots by using the imprecise receiving times of several cascades, network model parameters of the C&C channel, and the end-to-end delay distribution of the Internet. These receiving times can be gathered by monitoring the bots' external reactions to commands. Simulation results reveal that our method accurately estimates more than 90% of the edges in a 1000-member network with an average node degree of 50, by collecting the imprecise receiving times of 22 cascades. Even when receiving times are collected from only half of the bots, the same estimation accuracy can be achieved using 95 cascades.",
    "In the intriguing realm of grand unified theories (GUT), non-universal boundary conditions for gaugino masses can emerge at the unification scale, influencing the detectability of neutral MSSM Higgs bosons (h/H/A) at the LHC. This study delves into the impact of non-universal gaugino masses on Higgs boson production within the SUSY cascade decay chain: gluino → squark + quark, squark → neutralino_2 + quark, neutralino_2 → neutralino_1 + h/H/A, followed by h/H/A → b b̅ in proton-proton interactions.\n\nIn scenarios where gauginos have uniform masses, only the production of the light Higgs boson is feasible within the targeted parameter space. However, with non-universal gaugino masses, the production of heavy neutral MSSM Higgs bosons can become prevalent. This investigation examines the permissible parameter space aligned with WMAP constraints on the cold dark matter relic density for these gaugino mass parameters.\n\nMoreover, it is shown that varying representations can yield the requisite amount of dark matter across any point in the parameter space. Particularly in the case of non-universal gaugino masses, heavy Higgs bosons can be detected within the studied decay chain in regions that align with the WMAP-preferred neutralino relic density.",
    "Subwavelength modulators are essential components in integrated photonic-electronic circuits. However, developing a modulator with a nanometer-scale footprint, low switching energy, low insertion loss, and high modulation depth remains a challenge due to weak light-matter interactions. In this paper, we introduce a vanadium dioxide dual-mode plasmonic waveguide electroabsorption modulator designed on a metal-insulator-VO$_2$-insulator-metal (MIVIM) waveguide platform. By varying the refractive index of vanadium dioxide, the modulator can direct plasmonic waves through the low-loss dielectric insulator layer during the \"on\" state and the high-loss VO$_2$ layer during the \"off\" state. This approach significantly reduces insertion loss while maintaining a high modulation depth. For instance, this ultracompact waveguide modulator achieves a substantial modulation depth of approximately 10dB with an active size of only 200x50x220nm$^3$ (or ~{\\lambda}$^3$/1700), requiring a drive voltage of around 4.6V. This high-performance plasmonic modulator could be a crucial component in the advancement towards fully integrated plasmonic nanocircuits for next-generation chip technology.",
    "As cars become increasingly connected, combating automobile theft has become a critical challenge. To address this issue, a variety of technologies such as data mining, biometrics, and additional authentication methods have been proposed. Data mining, in particular, shows promise in capturing the unique characteristics of a car's owner. Previous studies have applied various algorithms to driving data to distinguish between the owner and potential thieves. These methods have relied on supervised learning, which requires labeled data sets; however, collecting thief driving patterns is impractical.\n\nTo address this limitation, we introduce a driver identification method using Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). The advantage of GAN is that it can create an identification model by learning solely from the owner's driving data. We trained the GAN using only data from the owner and employed the trained discriminator to verify the owner. Tests using real driving data demonstrated that our identification model effectively recognizes the car's owner. By combining this model with other driver authentication methods, we anticipate that the industry can develop practical solutions to prevent automobile theft.",
    "Slow oscillations (SlO) of magnetoresistance serve as a handy technique to gauge electronic structure parameters in quasi-two-dimensional metals. Our research explores applying this approach to multi-band conductors, such as iron-based high-temperature superconductors. We demonstrate that SlO can effectively measure the interlayer transfer integral in multi-band conductors, much like in single-band metals. Furthermore, SlO enable the measurement and comparison of effective masses or electron scattering rates across different bands.",

    "This paper introduces a method for speech emotion recognition that utilizes both speech features and transcriptions. Speech features like spectrograms and Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) preserve low-level emotion-related characteristics, while transcriptions capture semantic meaning, aiding various aspects of emotion detection. We tested multiple Deep Neural Network (DNN) architectures with different combinations of speech features and text inputs. Our proposed architectures outperformed state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy on a benchmark dataset. The MFCC-Text Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model was the most accurate for recognizing emotions in the IEMOCAP dataset.",
    "In this paper, we incorporate variational semantic memory into meta-learning to acquire long-term knowledge for few-shot learning. This memory accumulates and stores semantic information for probabilistic inference of class prototypes within a hierarchical Bayesian framework. It is built from scratch and gradually refined by absorbing information from experienced tasks, enabling the acquisition of long-term, general knowledge for learning new object concepts. Memory recall is formulated as the variational inference of a latent memory variable from addressed contents, allowing principled knowledge adaptation to individual tasks. Our variational semantic memory module provides efficient mechanisms for semantic information accumulation and adaptation in few-shot learning. Experiments demonstrate that probabilistic modeling of prototypes offers more informative representations of object classes than deterministic vectors. Consistent state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks underscores the advantage of variational semantic memory in enhancing few-shot recognition.",
    "The relativistic equations for four-quark systems involving open-charm and open-strange quarks are derived using the coupled-channel approach. The interaction between meson-meson states and four-quark states is analyzed. Four-quark amplitudes that include quarks of four different flavors (u, d, s, c) are formulated. The poles of these amplitudes are used to determine the masses of the tetraquarks. The mass values of tetraquarks with spin-parity JP=1-,2- are computed.",
    "The Fisher Matrix is essential for modern cosmological forecasting. We introduce Fisher4Cast, an open-source, user-friendly Fisher Matrix software with a GUI for automated LATEX file creation and Fisher ellipse generation. Designed for easy extension, it is written in Matlab but portable to Octave and Scilab. Fisher4Cast offers new 3-D and 4-D visualizations of the forecasting landscape and analyzes growth and curvature effects on future cosmological surveys. Available since May 2008 at http://www.cosmology.org.za, it reached 750 downloads in the first year. Version 2.2, released with this paper, includes a Quick Start guide and the code for this paper's figures, benefiting the cosmology and scientific communities.",
    "First-order logic-based knowledge representation captures the complexity of natural language and supports various probabilistic inference models. While symbolic representation facilitates quantitative reasoning with statistical probability, it poses challenges for integration with machine learning models that rely on numerical operations. Conversely, knowledge embedding—representing knowledge as high-dimensional, continuous vectors—offers a promising approach to complex reasoning, retaining semantic information and establishing quantifiable relationships. In this paper, we introduce the Recursive Neural Knowledge Network (RNKN), which integrates medical knowledge grounded in first-order logic with a recursive neural network to diagnose multiple diseases. By training RNKN on manually annotated Chinese Electronic Medical Records (CEMRs), we develop diagnosis-oriented knowledge embeddings and weight matrices. Our experimental results show that RNKN outperforms traditional machine learning models and the Markov Logic Network (MLN) in diagnostic accuracy. Additionally, the performance of RNKN improves with the extraction of more explicit evidence from CEMRs. As the number of training epochs increases, RNKN progressively elucidates the interpretation of knowledge embeddings.",
    "In an electron cooler device, multiple solenoids are typically installed to direct the electron beam's motion. These solenoids, however, also affect the ion beam in the cooler's storage ring. If the solenoids in the electron cooler are not perfectly compensated, they can couple the transverse motion of the ion beam in the storage ring. This paper examines the coupled transverse motion resulting from imperfectly compensated solenoids in the CSRm (the main storage ring at the Institute of Modern Physics in Lan Zhou, China). A novel method is used to calculate the coupled beam envelopes.",
    "We've noticed a near-infrared excess around the white dwarf PHL5038 using UKIDSS photometry, which hints at a cool, substellar companion. To dig deeper, we obtained H- and K-band spectra and images of PHL5038 with the NIRI instrument on Gemini North. Our observations show that the target consists of two distinct components: an 8000K DA white dwarf and what appears to be an L8 brown dwarf companion, which are about 0.94 arcseconds apart. We identified the companion's spectral type using standard indices for late L and T dwarfs. The projected separation between the two is about 55 AU, making this just the second known wide binary system with a white dwarf and a late L dwarf, the first being GD165AB. This particular system could serve as a valuable benchmark for testing substellar evolutionary models, especially for intermediate to older ages.",
    "We examine how dynamic streams and substructures affect estimates of the local escape speed and the total mass of Milky Way-like galaxies by modeling the high-velocity tail of local halo stars. Utilizing high-resolution, magneto-hydrodynamical cosmological zoom-in simulations, we resolve phase space substructures in regions around solar-like positions. Our findings reveal significant variations in phase space structure between different positions within individual galaxies and across our simulation suite. This substructure unevenly populates the high-velocity tail, causing discrepancies in mass estimates. We demonstrate that streams, sample noise, and truncation of the high-velocity tail below the escape speed contribute to a mass estimate distribution with a median approximately 20% lower than the true value and a spread factor of 2 across the suite. After correcting for these biases, we adjust the Milky Way mass estimate presented by Deason et al. to $1.29^{+0.37}_{-0.47} \\times 10^{12}$ $\\rm M_{\\odot}$.",
    "By using unconventional techniques, we can extract more than one bit of information per photon through high-dimensional orbital angular momentum (OAM) states for recognizing objects. These OAM states remain unaffected by the object's rotation: the information structure of an object's OAM spectrum stays consistent even if the object rotates randomly between measurements. Furthermore, OAM correlations alone are enough to fully reconstruct images of complex off-axis objects, revealing new object symmetries in the process. We also examine how information rates change when the object shifts off-center in the beam field and find that both the object’s symmetry signals and the information rates remain stable away from the beam center. These findings suggest useful applications for dynamic scanning, especially where symmetry and minimal, noninvasive measurements are needed.",
    "During Parker Solar Probe's first two trips around the Sun, we noticed a lot of rapid magnetic field flips, called switchbacks. These switchbacks popped up mainly in the near-Sun solar wind, showing up in clusters and possibly connecting to things like magnetic reconnection near the Sun’s surface. Since switchbacks come with faster plasma flows, we wondered if they were hotter than the surrounding plasma and if the tiny details inside a switchback were different from outside it.\n\nWe looked at data from the Solar Probe Cup and focused on times with big changes in angle to compare temperatures inside and outside switchbacks. Our research showed that the reduced distribution functions inside switchbacks matched up with a simple rotation of the background plasma. So, it turns out that the proton core parallel temperature is the same inside and outside switchbacks. This means there's no special temperature-speed relationship for the proton core inside these magnetic field switchbacks.\n\nWe also figured out that switchbacks align with Alfvénic pulses moving along open magnetic field lines, but we still don’t know where these pulses come from. Additionally, we saw no clear connection between radial Poynting flux and kinetic energy boosts, meaning that radial Poynting flux doesn’t seem to play a big role in how switchbacks behave.",
    "Through the Nainital-Cape Survey, we've identified eight $\\delta\\,$Scuti pulsators exhibiting oscillation periods ranging from several minutes to a few hours. To unravel the nature of these observed pulsational variations, we conducted non-adiabatic linear stability analyses on stellar models with masses between 1 and 3 M$_{\\odot}$. Our findings revealed several unstable low order p-modes, and the pulsation periods of these instabilities matched well with the observed data. Notably, for stars HD$\\,$118660, HD$\\,$113878, HD$\\,$102480, HD$\\,$98851, and HD$\\,$25515, we successfully explained the observed variations using low order radial p-mode pulsations.",
    "A new and detailed examination of classical particle motion within the framework of Lorentz-violating theories is explored. This study employs an enhanced Hamiltonian formalism to derive a Legendre Transformation that bridges the associated covariant Lagrangian and Hamiltonian forms. This methodological advancement facilitates the computation of particle trajectories by utilizing Hamilton's equations in momentum space and the Euler-Lagrange equations in velocity space, effectively bypassing certain singular points inherent in the theory. By imposing conditions that ensure the trajectories are smooth functions of both velocity and momentum, these singularities are naturally resolved. Furthermore, this method allows for the identification of specific segments of the dispersion relations that align with particular Lagrangian solutions. Detailed computations are provided, especially in relation to bipartite Finsler functions. Additionally, a direct connection is established between the derived Lagrangians and the solutions to the Dirac equation in a specific, exemplary case.",
    "Spectrum management is recognized as a critical step in enabling the technology of cognitive radio networks (CRNs). Most existing research on spectrum management in CRNs focuses on individual aspects of the problem, such as spectrum sensing, spectrum decision, spectrum sharing, or spectrum mobility. In this two-part paper, we propose that, for certain network configurations, performing multiple spectrum management tasks jointly can enhance spectrum efficiency. Our specific aim is to examine the uplink resource management problem in a CRN with multiple cognitive users (CUs) and access points (APs). To maximize their uplink transmission rates, CUs must associate with an appropriate AP (spectrum decision) and share the channels used by this AP with other CUs (spectrum sharing). These tasks are clearly interdependent, and the efficient and distributed execution of these tasks remains an open question in current literature.",
    "This text presents a simple, solvable statistical model to describe baryonic matter under the thermodynamic conditions of evolving core-collapsing supernovae. The model shows a first-order phase transition in the grand canonical ensemble, which is absent in the canonical ensemble. Like other systems in condensed matter physics, this difference between ensembles is associated with negative susceptibility and jumps in intensive variables related to the order parameter. This behavior arises because baryonic matter experiences both short-range attractive strong forces and long-range repulsive electromagnetic interactions, partly screened by electrons. This is expected in any theoretical treatment of nuclear matter in stars. The study also discusses the implications for supernova dynamics.",
    "To meet the requirements of a high-performance THz-FEL (Free Electron Laser), a compact FEL injector was proposed. A thermionic cathode, which is simpler and cheaper than a photo-cathode, was chosen to emit electrons. The effective bunch charge was improved to approximately 200pC by using an enhanced EC-ITC (External Cathode Independently Tunable Cells) RF gun to extract micro-bunches, almost eliminating back bombardment effects. Constant gradient accelerator structures were designed to increase energy to around 14MeV, and a focusing system was implemented to suppress emittance and maintain bunch quality. Key components of the FEL injector were analyzed for physical design and beam dynamics. Additionally, start-to-end simulations with multiple pulses were conducted using custom MATLAB and Parmela code. The results indicate that stable, high-brightness electron bunches with low energy spread and emittance can be consistently obtained.",
    "A whirlwind of claims surrounds the anomalies in the large-angle properties of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy measured by WMAP. Yet, the statistical significance of these anomalies remains elusive, primarily because the statistics used to pinpoint these irregularities were selected a posteriori. However, the thrilling possibility of uncovering new physics on the grandest observable scales makes it imperative to scrutinize these claims meticulously. Let's dive into three specific claims: the deficiency of large-angle power, the north-south power asymmetry, and the alignment of multipoles. To tackle the challenge of a posteriori statistics, the solution lies in unearthing a new data set that mirrors the physical scales of the large-angle CMB. Although this is a daunting endeavor, there are promising paths to explore.",
    "Multi-photon states can be generated through multiple parametric down conversion (PDC) processes. In these processes, a nonlinear crystal is subjected to high-power pumping. Theoretically, the greater the population of these states, the greater the discrepancy with local realistic descriptions. However, high-power pumping often results in low interference contrast in multi-photon PDC experiments. We propose a method to enhance this contrast. Our approach utilizes currently available optical devices, such as multiport beam splitters, which can divide incoming light from a single input mode into $M$ output modes. This method functions as a POVM filter and may enable a viable CHSH-Bell inequality test. Consequently, it could be advantageous in applications such as reducing communication complexity.",
    "The range of exponents of the transfer matrix determines the localization lengths in Anderson's model for a particle within a lattice subjected to a disordered potential. I demonstrate that combining a duality identity for determinants with Jensen's identity for subharmonic functions yields a formula for the spectrum in terms of the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian under non-Hermitian boundary conditions. This formula is exact and involves averaging over a Bloch phase instead of disorder. A preliminary study of the non-Hermitian spectra of Anderson's model in dimensions D=1 and D=2, focusing on the smallest exponent, is presented.",
    "In this article, we enhance extreme learning machines for regression tasks by employing a graph signal processing-based regularization. We presume that the target signal for prediction or regression is a graph signal. Given this assumption, we utilize the regularization to ensure that the output of an extreme learning machine is smooth across a specified graph. Simulation results with real data indicate that this regularization is significantly beneficial, particularly when the available training data is limited in size and affected by noise.",
    "Get ready for an exciting dive into the heart of turbulent plasmas like the solar wind! When it comes to understanding heating in these weakly collisional systems, we can't ignore inter-particle collisions. These collisions are key players, transforming ordered energy into heat through irreversible relaxation towards thermal equilibrium. Recently, Pezzi et al. (Phys. Rev. Lett., vol. 116, 2016, p. 145001) electrified the field by revealing that plasma collisionality skyrockets thanks to intricate velocity space structures. \n\nBuilding on this groundbreaking discovery, we crank up the energy by comparing how the fully nonlinear Landau operator stacks up against the linearized version. Zeroing in on the relaxation of an out-of-whack distribution function in a homogeneous, force-free plasma, we underscore the crucial role of nonlinearities in the collisional operator for gauging collision effects. Both nonlinear and linearized operators show that different phase space structures dissipate over time. But here’s the thrill: with the linearized operator, these times are consistently longer, indicating that fine velocity structures hang around longer when nonlinearities are omitted. This revelation shakes things up, showing that neglecting nonlinearities means a slower dissipation of these intricate structures. Buckle up as we uncover the dynamic world of collisional effects in turbulent plasmas!",
    "In this research, we applied Mask-RCNN, a deep-learning algorithm for computer vision and object detection, to semiconductor defect inspection. Stochastic defect detection and classification in semiconductor manufacturing have become increasingly challenging with the continued miniaturization of circuit patterns (e.g., pitches less than 32 nm). Current defect inspection methods using optical and e-beam inspection tools often rely on rule-based techniques, leading to misclassification and requiring human expert intervention. We extended our prior deep learning-based defect classification and detection method to enhance defect instance segmentation in SEM images. This includes accurately defining defect boundaries and generating a mask for each defect category. Our approach allows us to extract, calibrate, and quantify the pixels of each mask, enabling the counting of defect instances and calculation of their surface area. We aim to detect and segment various inter-class stochastic defects, such as bridges, breaks, and line collapses, and accurately differentiate intra-class multi-categorical bridge defects (e.g., thin, single, multi-line, horizontal, non-horizontal) for aggressive pitches and thin resists (High NA applications). Our proposed method demonstrates both quantitative and qualitative effectiveness.",
    "We present an enhanced and generalized bound on the parameter $\\lambda$ — the count of common neighbors shared by a pair of adjacent vertices — in distance-regular graphs $G$. This improvement extends the bounds previously proposed by Spielman (1996) and Pyber (2014) for strongly regular graphs. Our new bound plays a crucial role in recent advancements related to the complexity of testing isomorphism for strongly regular graphs, as discussed by Babai, Chen, Sun, Teng, and Wilmes in 2013. \n\nThe foundation of our proof rests on a clique geometry identified by Metsch in 1991, which under certain parameter constraints, provides significant insights. Additionally, we offer a streamlined proof for an important asymptotic outcome derived from Metsch's work: specifically, if $k\\mu = o(\\lambda^2)$, then every edge in $G$ resides in a unique maximal clique of size approximately equal to $\\lambda$, while all other cliques are of negligible size compared to $\\lambda$. Here, $k$ represents the vertex degree, and $\\mu$ signifies the number of common neighbors between pairs of vertices situated two steps apart.\n\nWe highlight that the cliques identified by Metsch are \"asymptotically Delsarte\" under the condition $k\\mu = o(\\lambda^2)$, thus categorizing families of distance-regular graphs with these parameters as \"asymptotically Delsarte-geometric\".",
    "Recent galaxy observations reveal that star formation varies dramatically across different galactic environments. To unravel the complexities of galactic-scale star formation, it's essential to understand how giant molecular clouds form and evolve under extreme conditions. Our study zeros in on the puzzling lack of massive stars in the dense molecular gas of strongly barred galaxies. \n\nWe present a detailed hydrodynamical simulation of a strongly barred galaxy, using a stellar potential model based on observational data from NGC 1300. By comparing cloud properties in the bar, bar-end, and spiral arms, we discover that the average cloud virial parameter is consistently around 1, regardless of the environment. This finding rules out the gravitationally-bound state of clouds as the reason for the scarcity of massive stars in strong bars.\n\nInstead, we investigate cloud-cloud collisions, hypothesized to spark massive star formation. Our results show that collision speeds in the bar are significantly higher than in other regions. By analyzing cloud kinetics, we determine that these rapid collisions likely stem from random-like cloud movements caused by the elliptical gas orbits influenced by the bar potential.\n\nThese findings suggest that the observed lack of active star formation in strong bars is due to the high-speed cloud collisions unique to these regions. These fast collisions, driven by violent galactic-scale gas motions, are inefficient at forming massive stars, shedding new light on star formation processes in extreme galactic environments.",
    "The mass-metallicity relationship (MMR) of star-forming galaxies is well-established, but there are disagreements about its exact shape and its dependence on other factors. \n\nAims: We aim to measure the MMR in the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey, compare our findings with those from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), and explore how different selection criteria might explain disparities in the literature. \n\nMethods: We use strong emission line ratio diagnostics to determine oxygen abundances and apply various selection criteria, including minimum signal-to-noise in emission lines and apparent and absolute magnitude, to study variations in the inferred MMR.\n\nResults: The shape and position of the MMR can vary significantly depending on the metallicity calibration and selection criteria used. After choosing a robust metallicity calibration, we find that the MMR for redshifts 0.061 < z < 0.35 in GAMA aligns reasonably well with that in the SDSS, despite differences in the luminosity range.\n\nConclusions: Given the significant variations in the MMR due to changes in sample selection criteria and methods, we recommend caution when directly comparing MMR results from different surveys. Additionally, there may be modest evolutionary changes in the MMR within the GAMA sample over the redshift range of 0.06 < z < 0.35.",
    "Through thermodynamic analysis, we develop a set of equations that describe the seepage velocities of fluid components in immiscible and incompressible two-phase flow within porous media. These equations introduce a novel velocity function known as the co-moving velocity, which is intrinsic to the characteristics of the porous medium. In conjunction with a constitutive relation linking velocities to driving forces, such as the pressure gradient, these equations form a comprehensive framework. We apply this theoretical framework to analytically solve four variants of the capillary tube model and validate the theory numerically using a network model.",
    "Nature's inventiveness, shown in the diversity of life forms and functions, sets living beings apart from nonliving entities. It's no surprise that this trait is a central focus in artificial life studies. Since Darwin, we've known that this diversity arises from evolution, termed Open-Ended Evolution (OEE) in the field. This article is the second of two special issues on current OEE research, summarizing the contents of both. The work featured here was primarily presented at the 2018 Conference on Artificial Life in Tokyo, with roots in prior workshops held in Cancun and York. We provide a simplified categorization of OEE and summarize the progress reflected in the articles within this special issue.",
    "Discover the dynamic properties of MgO/Ag(001) ultrathin films with substitutional Mg atoms integrated into the interface metal layer! Through a combination of Auger electron diffraction experiments, ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we delve deep into the subject.\n\nUtilizing the layer-by-layer resolution of the Mg KL_23 L_23 Auger spectra and advanced multiple scattering calculations, we begin by pinpointing the interlayer distances and key morphological parameters of the MgO/Ag(001) system, both with and without Mg integration at the interface. Our findings reveal that incorporating Mg atoms induces a significant distortion in the interface layers, profoundly affecting the metal/oxide electronic structure. Notably, there’s a substantial reduction in the work function by 0.5 eV, attributed to variations in the band offset at the interface.\n\nOur experimental observations align perfectly with DFT calculations, which not only replicate the lattice distortion but also, through a Bader analysis, uncover that increasing the interface Mg concentration causes electron transfer from Mg to Ag atoms within the metallic interface layer. This local lattice distortion emerges due to the attractive and repulsive Coulomb interactions between O2- ions in the MgO interface layer and the positively (negatively) charged Mg (Ag) neighbors.\n\nInterestingly, although this distortion impacts the work function, the reduction effect is somewhat limited. Ultimately, our analysis of the induced work function changes—examining charge transfer, rumpling, and electrostatic compression—concludes that the primary driver behind the metal/oxide work function alterations due to interface Mg atom incorporation is the increase in electrostatic compression.",
    "Keeping a close eye on industrial processes is crucial. Spotting changes in process parameters quickly lets you fix problems before they get out of hand. This task gets particularly tricky when your measurements fall below the sensitivity limits of your system or detection limits, making your observations incomplete - these are known as left-censored data. When more than 70% of your data faces this issue, traditional methods won't cut it. You need special statistical techniques to get a true picture of your process's health. This paper introduces a method to estimate process parameters in these challenging situations and unveils a corresponding control chart, complete with a detailed algorithm.",
    "Clustering plays a vital role in various data-driven fields and has been heavily researched with respect to distance metrics and clustering algorithms. However, there has been limited attention given to the learning of representations specifically for clustering purposes. In this study, we introduce Deep Embedded Clustering (DEC), an approach that concurrently learns both feature representations and cluster assignments through the use of deep neural networks. DEC creates a mapping from the original data space to a reduced-dimensional feature space, continuously refining a clustering objective. Our experiments with image and text datasets demonstrate a notable enhancement compared to the current leading techniques.",
    "We extend the insightful research by Sarvotham et al. [2005], which demonstrated the impact of peak transmission rates on network burstiness. By analyzing TCP packet headers, we group packets into sessions, each defined by a 5-tuple: (S, D, R, Peak R, Initiation T) = (total payload, duration, average transmission rate, peak transmission rate, initiation time). After thorough analysis, we propose a new definition for peak transmission rates. Contrary to Sarvotham et al. [2005], who divided sessions into two categories—alpha and beta—we distribute them into ten segments based on the empirical quantiles of the peak rate variable. This approach showcases that the beta group is not uniform. Our refined segmentation uncovers additional structural details missed by the previous two-group method. In each segment, we examine the dependence structure of (S, D, R) and observe that it varies significantly across different groups. Moreover, within each segment, session initiation times closely follow a Poisson process, a property not observed when evaluating the dataset as a whole. Consequently, we conclude that peak rate levels are critical for understanding network structure and for creating accurate simulations of real-world data. Based on our findings, we propose a straightforward method for simulating network traffic.",
    "The Brouwer fixed-point theorem in topology asserts that any continuous function mapping a compact convex set into itself has at least one fixed point, that is, a point \\( x_0 \\) such that \\( f(x_0) = x_0 \\). Under specific conditions, this fixed point can be associated with the throat of a traversable wormhole, represented by \\( b(r_0) = r_0 \\) for the shape function \\( b = b(r) \\). Consequently, the potential existence of wormholes can be inferred from purely mathematical principles without exceeding current physical constraints.",
    "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have recently been utilized to address problems in both computer vision and medical image analysis. However, most methods can only handle 2D images, while the majority of medical data used in clinical settings consists of 3D volumes. In this study, we present a method for 3D image segmentation using a volumetric, fully convolutional neural network. Our CNN is trained end-to-end on MRI volumes of the prostate, allowing it to predict segmentation for the entire volume simultaneously. We introduce a new objective function based on the Dice coefficient, optimized during training, which helps manage the imbalance between foreground and background voxels. To counter the limited number of annotated volumes for training, we enhance the data by applying random non-linear transformations and histogram matching. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method performs well on challenging test data and significantly reduces processing time compared to previous methods.",
    "The non-relativistic two-body system with Coulomb interaction has a spectrum known as the Balmer series, $E_n=\\frac{\\alpha^2m}{4n^2}$, derived from the Schrödinger equation. In 1954, Wick and Cutkosky found that for $\\alpha>\\frac{\\pi}{4}$, relativistic effects in the Bethe-Salpeter equation result in additional levels beyond the Balmer series. The nature of these new states was unclear and questioned. Recently, we have shown that these extra states are dominated by the exchange of massless particles moving at the speed of light, which is why they are absent in the non-relativistic Schrödinger framework.",
    "We investigate the fundamental characteristics of quantum f-relative entropy using f(.) as an operator convex function. We establish the conditions for equality under monotonicity and joint convexity, which are more comprehensive than previous conditions as they apply to a broader class of operator convex functions and differ from those for f(t) = -ln(t). Additionally, we define quantum f-entropy based on quantum f-relative entropy, exploring its properties and presenting the equality conditions in certain scenarios. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the f-extended versions of Holevo information, the entanglement-assisted capacity, and the coherent information adhere to the data processing inequality, and we provide the equality conditions for the f-coherent information.",
    "Modifying or shifting an input image should not alter the outcomes of various computer vision tasks. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) inherently maintain translation equivariance; hence, translating an input image results in correspondingly translated feature maps. However, this property is not shared with rotations. While data augmentation is commonly used to achieve global rotation equivariance, maintaining equivariance at the patch level is more challenging. We introduce Harmonic Networks, or H-Nets, which are CNNs that ensure equivariance to both patch-wise translation and 360-degree rotation. This is accomplished by substituting standard CNN filters with circular harmonics that provide a maximal response and orientation for each receptive field patch. H-Nets offer a rich representation that is both parameter-efficient and computationally inexpensive. We demonstrate that deep feature maps within the network inherently encode intricate rotational invariants. Our layers are versatile and compatible with recent architectural advances and methods, such as deep supervision and batch normalization. Additionally, we achieve state-of-the-art classification performance on rotated-MNIST and deliver competitive results on other benchmark datasets.",
    "We analyze reflection spectra of directly coupled waveguide and cavity systems. The observed Fano lines reveal insights into reflection and coupling processes. Unlike side-coupled systems, the Fano line shape stems from the coupling process between the measurement device fiber and the waveguide, not the waveguide termini. Our experimental results and analytical model show that the Fano parameter is highly sensitive to the coupling condition. Even minimal movement of the fiber, below the Rayleigh range, can drastically change the Fano line shape.",
    "The strength and vertical distribution of atmospheric turbulence are crucial factors affecting the performance of optical and infrared telescopes, both with and without adaptive optics. However, measuring these parameters remains challenging. We introduce a novel technique that utilizes a sequence of short-exposure images of a star field taken with a small telescope. By analyzing the differential motion between all pairs of star images, we compute the structure functions of longitudinal and transverse wavefront tilt across various angular separations. These measurements are then matched with theoretical predictions from simple turbulence models using a Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo optimization process. This approach allows us to estimate the turbulence profile in the lower atmosphere, determine the total and free-atmosphere seeing, and assess the outer scale. We present results from Monte-Carlo simulations that validate the technique and provide examples using data from the second AST3 telescope at Dome A in Antarctica.",
    "We're excited to introduce the concept of an n-plectic structure! It's a dynamic combination of a commutative and torsionless Lie Rinehart pair along with a unique cocycle from its Chevalley-Eilenberg complex. This 'n-plectic cocycle' sparks an extension of the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex with what we call symplectic tensors. The cohomology of this extension brings a thrilling expansion to Hamiltonian functions and vector fields, transforming them into tensors and cotensors across various degrees, up to certain coboundaries, and forming a robust Lie oo-algebra structure. And that's not all—momentum maps burst onto the scene here as compelling weak Lie oo-morphisms from any Lie oo-algebra into the vibrant Lie oo-algebra of Hamiltonian (co)tensors. Get ready to dive into this exhilarating new realm!",
    "Amorphous solids or glasses often show stretched-exponential decay in their various properties over long periods, like in the intermediate scattering function, dielectric relaxation modulus, and time-elastic modulus. This is especially noticeable near the glass transition. In this Letter, we focus on dielectric relaxation to demonstrate that this kind of stretched-exponential relaxation is closely linked to the unique lattice dynamics of glasses. By reworking the Lorentz model of dielectric matter in a more general way, we can describe the dielectric response based on the vibrational density of states (DOS) for a random collection of spherical particles that interact harmonically with their nearest neighbors. Interestingly, we discovered that near the glass transition (which aligns with the Maxwell rigidity transition) this system's dielectric relaxation matches stretched-exponential behavior with Kohlrausch exponents between 0.56 and 0.65, which is consistent with experimental observations. The key reason for stretched-exponential relaxation can be traced back to soft modes, known as the boson peak, in the DOS.",
    "To demonstrate the challenges of achieving representation disentanglement in the text domain without supervision, we selected successful models from the image domain. We evaluated these models using six disentanglement metrics, downstream classification tasks, and homotopy. To aid in evaluation, we created two synthetic datasets with known generative factors. Our experiments reveal a gap in the text domain and show that elements like representation sparsity or coupling with the decoder can affect disentanglement. To our knowledge, this is the first work addressing unsupervised representation disentanglement in text, providing a framework and datasets for future research.",
    "This paper introduces a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm to address the unit commitment (UC) problem in power systems. The UC problem is broken down into three components: a quadratic subproblem, a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) subproblem, and an unconstrained quadratic subproblem. The first and third subproblems are solved using a classical optimization solver, while the QUBO subproblem is tackled with a quantum algorithm known as the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). These subproblems are then iteratively coordinated through a three-block alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm. Using Qiskit on the IBM Q system for simulations, the results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in solving the UC problem.",
    "It has recently been postulated that the identification of numerous extremely low-amplitude oscillatory modes within Delta Scuti stars hinges upon achieving a high signal-to-noise ratio. Such a significant discovery, unattainable through ground-based telescopes, represents a primary scientific objective of the CoRoT (Convection Rotation and planetary Transits) space mission, which is developed and operated by CNES (Centre National d'Études Spatiales). This paper delineates the findings derived from the study of HD 50844, where an extensive dataset comprising 140,016 data points underwent analysis via independent methodologies with multiple verifications performed. Remarkably, a precision of \\(10^{-5}\\) magnitude was achieved in the amplitude spectra of the CoRoT time series.\n\nThe frequency analysis of the CoRoT data unveiled an extensive array of frequencies, numbering in the hundreds, within the range of 0–30 d\\(^{-1}\\). Every cross-validation technique confirmed this groundbreaking observation. Consequently, the initial hypothesis that Delta Scuti stars possess a very rich and intricate frequency structure stands substantiated. Furthermore, spectroscopic mode identification corroborated this by recognizing modes of very high degrees, up to \\(\\ell = 14\\). This study also demonstrates that the anticipated cancellation effects are inadequate in eliminating the flux variations pertaining to these modes at the precision level provided by CoRoT measurements.\n\nGround-based observations have indicated that HD 50844 is an evolved star, slightly deficient in heavy elements, currently positioned at the Terminal Age Main Sequence. Owing possibly to this particular evolutionary stage, the frequency set does not exhibit a clear regular distribution. The dominant frequency component (\\(f_1 = 6.92\\) d\\(^{-1}\\)) has been identified as the fundamental radial mode, a determination made through the combined use of photometric and spectroscopic data from ground-based sources.\n\nAdditionally, this research is underpinned by observations made utilizing ESO (European Southern Observatory) telescopes as part of the ESO Large Programme LP178.D-0361. It also incorporates data gathered from the Observatorio de Sierra Nevada, the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional at San Pedro Mártir, and the Piszkéstető Mountain Station of Konkoly Observatory.",
    "The article dives into the fascinating observations of star-forming regions S231-S235 through 'quasi-thermal' lines of ammonia (NH$_3$) and cyanoacetylene (HC$_3$N), as well as the maser lines of methanol (CH$_3$OH) and water vapor (H$_2$O). These regions are part of the giant molecular cloud G174+2.5. By analyzing archival CO data, we identified all the massive molecular clumps in G174+2.5. For each of these clumps, we determined mass, size, and CO column density before conducting detailed observations.\n\nExcitingly, we report the first detections of NH$_3$ and HC$_3$N lines in the molecular clumps WB89 673 and WB89 668, indicating the presence of high-density gas. Using ammonia emission data, we estimated the physical properties of the molecular gas within these clumps. We discovered that the gas temperature ranges from 16 to 30 K and the hydrogen number density spans from 2.8 to 7.2$\\times10^3$ cm$^{-3}$. Adding to the intrigue, we newly detected the shock-tracing line of the CH$_3$OH molecule at 36.2 GHz toward WB89 673.",
    "We present the lowest frequency observations of gamma-ray burst (GRB) 171205A using the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT), spanning a frequency range of 250–1450 MHz and monitored over a period of $4-937$ days. This is the first GRB afterglow detected within the 250–500 MHz range and the second brightest GRB observed with the uGMRT. Despite observing the GRB for nearly 1000 days, there is no sign of it entering a non-relativistic phase. We also examine archival ${\\it Chandra}$ X-ray data from approximately day 70 and day 200 but find no evidence of a jet break from the combined data analysis. We model the synchrotron afterglow emission originating from a relativistic, isotropic, self-similar deceleration and from a shock-breakout of a wide-angle cocoon. Our data enables us to analyze the nature and density of the surrounding medium of the burst. The results indicate a deviation from a standard constant density medium, suggesting the GRB occurred in a stratified wind-like environment. Our findings show that the lowest frequency measurements, which cover the absorbed sections of the light curves, are essential to uncover the GRB environment. When combined with other published data, our observations suggest that the radio afterglow includes contributions from two components: a weak, perhaps slightly off-axis jet, and a surrounding wider cocoon, matching the results of Izzo et al. (2019). The cocoon emission likely dominates during early epochs, while the jet becomes more significant at later times, leading to flatter radio light curves.",
    "The recently developed theory of quasi-Lie schemes is applied to various Emden-type equations. A method to handle these and their generalizations is presented. We derive t-dependent constants of motion for specific Emden equations using particular solutions, recovering previously known results. Additionally, t-dependent constants of motion for certain Emden-type equations are also recovered.",
    "We explore the study of charged Higgs bosons as predicted by a model characterized by the gauge symmetry $SU(3)_c \\otimes SU(3)_L \\otimes U(1)_X$. By examining Yukawa couplings that mix scales from small (around GeV) to large (around TeV), we demonstrate that the model foresees the production of hypercharge-one $H_1^{\\pm}$ and hypercharge-two $H_2^{\\pm}$ Higgs bosons in $pp$ collisions, though at varying production rates. At lower energies, $H_1^{\\pm}$ bosons behave similarly to the charged Higgs bosons found in a two Higgs doublet model (2HDM), while $H_2^{\\pm}$ bosons are additional like-charged Higgs particles originating from the 3-3-1 framework. Consequently, identifying multiple like-charged Higgs boson resonances could validate the alignment between theoretical models and experimental results. We investigate the production of $H_{1,2}^{\\pm}$ pairs and their associated production with $tb$ at the CERN LHC collider. Notably, our findings suggest that pair production in gluon-gluon collisions can be as prominent as single production, facilitated by the exchange of a heavy neutral $Z'$ gauge boson proposed by the model. When considering the decays into leptons $H_{1,2}^{\\pm} \\rightarrow \\tau \\nu_{\\tau}$, we identify scenarios where small peaks of $H_{2}^{\\pm}$-boson events in transverse mass distributions stand out against the $H_{1}^{\\pm}$ background.",
    "Isospin breaking in the $K_{\\ell 4}$ form factors, caused by the difference between charged and neutral pion masses, is examined using a framework based on suitably subtracted dispersion representations. These form factors are iteratively constructed up to two loops in the low-energy expansion, ensuring analyticity, crossing symmetry, and unitarity from two-meson intermediate states. The paper provides analytical expressions for the phases of the two-loop form factors in the $K^\\pm\\to\\pi^+\\pi^- e^\\pm \\nu_e$ channel, enabling the connection between experimentally measured form-factor phase shifts (beyond the isospin limit) and theoretically studied $S$- and $P$-wave $\\pi\\pi$ phase shifts (within the isospin limit). Unlike previous analyses based on one-loop chiral perturbation theory, this study explores the dependence on the two $S$-wave scattering lengths $a_0^0$ and $a_0^2$ in a comprehensive manner. The phases of the $K^\\pm\\to\\pi^+\\pi^- e^\\pm \\nu_e$ form factors, as obtained by the NA48/2 collaboration at CERN SPS, are reanalyzed, incorporating isospin-breaking corrections to extract precise values for the scattering lengths $a_0^0$ and $a_0^2$.",
    "In this exciting paper, we take the groundbreaking results from \\cite{1,2,3,4}, especially \\cite{4}, and push them even further to deliver a thrilling statistical description of the cosmological constant in a cosmological de Sitter universe through the lens of massless excitations with Planckian effects! To start, we reveal that at a classical level, a positive cosmological constant $\\Lambda>0$ is achievable only as $T\\rightarrow 0$. Drawing a fascinating parallel to black holes, we show that once quantum effects are factored in, $\\Lambda$ can indeed be represented via massless excitations, thanks to the inclusion of quantum corrections to the Misner-Sharp mass. But there's more! Quantum fluctuations introduce an effective cosmological constant that varies with the physical scale considered, presenting a potential breakthrough solution to the cosmological constant problem without needing a quintessence field. The minuscule actual value of $\\Lambda$ could be attributed to a quantum decoherence scale above the Planck length, allowing spacetime to evolve as a pristine de Sitter universe with a small averaged cosmological constant, beautifully frozen in its lowest energy state. How captivating is that?",
    "We explore the properties of a one-dimensional spin-glass model with vector spins at both zero and finite temperatures, focusing on the scenario where the number of spin components, m, approaches infinity, and the interactions decay with a power, \\(\\sigma\\), relative to distance. Additionally, a diluted version of the model is examined, revealing significant differences compared to the fully connected model. At zero temperature, we calculate defect energies by comparing the ground-state energies of systems with periodic and antiperiodic boundary conditions, establishing the relationship between the defect-energy exponent \\(\\theta\\) and \\(\\sigma\\). The relationship \\(\\theta = 3/4 - \\sigma\\) provides a solid fit, indicating the upper critical value of \\(\\sigma\\) is 3/4, which aligns with the lower critical dimension for the d-dimensional short-range version of the model. For finite temperatures, we solve the large m saddle-point equations self-consistently, allowing us to access the correlation function, order parameter, and spin-glass susceptibility. We pay particular attention to the different forms of finite-size scaling effects below and above the critical value \\(\\sigma = 5/8\\), corresponding to the upper critical dimension 8 for the hypercubic short-range model.",
    "Of^+ supergiants have properties between regular O-stars and Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars, with significant similarities to WN-type objects, especially in the visible and near-infrared spectra, indicating common stellar wind properties. We present the first dedicated X-ray observations of HD16691 (O4If^+) and HD14947 (O5f^+). These observations reveal a soft thermal spectrum consistent with single O-type star emissions but with slightly lower X-ray luminosity than expected. This suggests their stellar wind properties significantly impact X-ray emission, marking an intermediate stage between O and WR stars due to enhanced wind density.",
    "The AARTFAAC project is set to revolutionize astronomical observation by implementing an All-Sky Monitor (ASM) powered by the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) telescope. This cutting-edge initiative will enable real-time, 24/7 monitoring of low-frequency radio transients across the majority of the sky visible to LOFAR, capturing events in timescales from milliseconds to several days. A crucial aspect is its capability for rapid follow-up observations with the full LOFAR upon detecting potential transient candidates.\n\nThe project's ambitious goals present numerous implementation challenges: imaging the vast all-sky field, ensuring low-latency processing, maintaining continuous availability, and achieving autonomous operation of the ASM. The first challenge has already led to the development of the world's largest correlator for the ASM, boasting an unprecedented number of input channels. Once operational, it will produce about 150,000 correlations per second per spectral channel.\n\nInitial test observations using the existing LOFAR infrastructure have been conducted to fine-tune and validate the ASM's design parameters. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the AARTFAAC data processing pipeline and highlights some of the core challenges by showcasing all-sky images from a test observation. These preliminary results offer quantitative insights into the instrument’s potential capabilities.",
    "Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars are evolved successors of massive O-type stars and are believed to be potential precursors to Type Ib/c core-collapse supernovae (SNe). Our recent HST/WFC3 survey of Wolf-Rayet stars in M101 highlights findings based on the detection efficiency of narrow-band versus broad-band optical imaging methods. We demonstrate that, on average, 42% of WR stars, rising to approximately 85% in central regions, are exclusively detected using narrow-band imaging. Consequently, the absence of WR stars at the locations of around 10 Type Ib/c SNe in broad-band imaging no longer strongly suggests a non-WR progenitor pathway."
