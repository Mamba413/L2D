    "Yeah, sorry for not writing for a whole there, but I've had a pretty busy weekend so far. I found out I have about 20 tests on Tuesday because my teachers are evil...but oh well. We had marching yesterday. It was cool. We stayed inside the whole time, and I got to play second part, so the music part will be really easy. I left early from marching at around 5:00, then went out to dinner with my friends (I made the plans before I knew about marching). So, dinner was fun. It was Kelly's birthday, so it was cool. Then we went to Kel's for a sleepover, and did bunches of neat stuff, and I went to sleep earlier than usual for a sleepover since I had to be at a Bar Mitzvah this morning. It was pretty neat. I have to do this project for CR, and we have to go to two different places of worship than our own. So, one is obviously a Jewish synagogue, and I think I'm going to go to a mosque for my other one, but who knows...so, this has been my only chance to write, and I actually have to go now, so I'll write more later...maybe.  *Ya di amore*",
    "Yeah, so today was ok, late arrival. I'm not in the mood to write much, so..I probably will end up writing a ton. I always end up doing that when I say I don't want to write much. Nothing interesting happened in any of my classes, and I only talked with a couple of good people including, \"You know who\"...except, you don't know who, \"You know who,\" is. Oh well, no one reads this thing anyway. I made it to the top of the rock climbing wall today. Kelly and I intend to conquer the whole wall. It'll be fun. Jazz was good fun as always...heh, and that's really it. Have a lovely evening everyone, and I am off to sleepyland. (I actually didn't write a lot. I'm shocked.)  *Ya di Amore*",
    "Thought- OK...so, I'm all for midgets and whatnot. I'm not all, \"down with midgets,\" but really, don't you think it'd be rude to say, \"Up with midgets?\"  ~Ya di amore~",
    "Yeah, so it's later. My parents found something constructive for me to do...clean. Grrr, why do parents always think of that constructive crap? It's really obnoxious. I'm sitting here enjoyig my time of peace, no homework, and listening to jazz...and all of a sudden, \"Hey catie, go clean.\" So, I say what I always say, \"Yeah sure, fine, I'll clean.\" (Of course I almost never do this,) except..the problem was, my mom came upstairs, and asked me all nicely and whatnot to clean with that momly voice that makes you feel really guilty. and so I trudge downstairs get the cleaning stuff, and clean the bathroom. Bleh! I can't stand cleaning. I think I should be a gold digger, and marry a rich guy so I can have a cleaning lady, and so I can hire a cook to make me peanut butter sandwiches all the time, and then when I get super duper fat, and this guy wants a divorce, it'll all be good, because I won't have signed a prenuptial agreement. So I'll still get half the assets. Now of course, I'll have to become a witch first in order to make a rich guy, or any guy for that matter marry me. But see...now you all know my plan, so I'll have to come up with a new plan. Oh well. Anyway, I really have nothing to write, but I'm not in the mood to talk to anyone, so I'm just writing. I wish I could go to the park. It's my favorite place in the world. I bring my mini disc thing-a-ma-bobber, and go on the swings, and think and swing at the same time. It really is a fantastic place to go when you need to be alone, and think about stuff...except when the little kids come, and they look at you like you're frankenstein because you're a big kid on a swing...so, they're all afraid to get onto that other swing. It drives them crazy, because I usually stay there for an hour or so. I love little kids. They make me laugh. :) Anyway, I've bored you enough, so I shall write more at some later time.  ~Ya di amore~",
    "Yeah, so this is just a place for me to vent about my, \"oh so horrible life in my bubble town.\" Sarcasm really is wasted online most of the time. I don't know why I bother with it. It either sounds like I'm a mean horrible person, or I'm serious. Oh well, anyway, today was surprisingly good for a Monday. I got a pretty good night of sleep last night, and actually did my homework. Went to school, sadly on the bus...but at least I got to sit alone. Why sit alone you ask? It's my only time to have, \"Alone time,\"  and I had my trumpet with me, so that kind of gets in the way. Anyway, I got to school, and of course said hello to everyone. Brandon was at least feeling a little better today which is good...except for the story that went along with it, which involved him, and ceramic (he, of course did not say that as politely.) Anyway, that was good. Carson came by to see me, and check on this alleged new mitten policy, and she wears mittens in school all the time, so of course she was upset. I made the rounds with her after that, saw cute Jake, a girl from Speech Team, and some other folks. The six minute bell didn't ring so I was a bit late getting to Wind Ensemble. Meh, it's ok. My trumpet section is crazy anyway. We were supposed to be doing sectionals, but that didn't exactly happen...we sort of got yelled at by A. I played my music theory composition (which was horrid)  but I'm glad I got it over with. Mrs. Kane yelled at us about our Lit Analysis papers...no F's but some D's...that'll be me. Anyway, rock climbing in gym today! Yay! It was super fun. I just want to do more of it. Ummm, then the rest of my day was even more uneventful than the first half, but I actually have no homework, so what am I supposed to do with my time? Something else productive? Psh. Yeah right. We didn't end up having combo, which of course...was excellent, because I can't solo...heh. We wont even go down that road, but anyway, then I came home, ate food, and here I am...being incredibly wasteful of my time, and writing this thing. I'll write more later...maybe...if anything actually happens. Anyway, I'm out for now.  ~Ya di amore~",
    ":o) Hey...it looks like Alex. You know, the nose taking up the whole face kind of thing!! Except the smiley is MUCH cuter!",
    "I'm baaack, well, sort of. I have a lesson soon, so I'm really not back for long, just looking for something to do to pass the time. Oh look! A penny! :) So, how was everyone's day? Makes ya think...well, makes me hink, (which is nearly impossible) of who actually answers back to the computer. I certainly do. Then again...I can be seen talking to Genevieve, my locker at school. You know what bugs me? No? Yes? Well, what bugs me (aside from the word, \"bugs,\") is parentheses. I use them all the time, but I don't know how to use them correctly. Grr, pooey. It's like the tootsie roll thing, except instead of, \"The world may never know,\" it's more like, \"Catie may never know because she's an idiot.\" OK...this will probably be a pretty abrupt change in subjects but someone just called me, and I completely forgot what I was writing about, and I don't want to take the effort to get back into the train of thought I was in before. Steve just called about chem stuff. He's such a cool kid, I love him. In a friend kind of way of course. :) He's also got the coolest hair. Chemistry...ah, I dislike it with a deep burning passon that eats away at the soul. No...not really, but..it is rather obnoxious. Well..we had the whole evening with humanities thing kast night. Yikes. It was...not great, lets just put it that way, and never bring it up again. Hmmm, this is odd. I have no homework for once, and I had a free afternoon. No jazz all week. This is both good and bad. I love jazz, and yet...it's nice to have free time. I wonder if anyone's noticed how completely random everything I've written on here is. Heh. More fun! You all know me...spontanious Catie. RAR! Ah, guess what? Guess...come on...I bet you aren't guessing...GUESS!!! Alright sorry, I'll just tell you. I went on high ropes yesterday, and made it across the swinging balance beam with Peter. Of course, Mr. Z finds something wrong in EVERYTHING we do, so...Peter and I didn't do it correctly. Evil. Hmmm...possibly I should go warm up for my trumpet lesson. Yes? No? Ah, that's super fun to say. I'm having so much fun writing random stuff thought. Oh well, more later maybe. You're all fantastic people if you've made it this far. Either that, or your just dumb and don't know that the little X in the upper right-hand corner gets you away from this madness.  *Ya di amore* :o)",
    "Wow, haven't written in a long time. Been pretty busy lately with Disney and then make-up work. Disney was a blast. Even the bus ride wasn't as bad as I expected it to be. it was actually kind of...well...fun. *Gasp* Yes well, I did enjoy myself at Disney, but it's nice to be home. I've created a theory about going on vacation with your friends. Don't. At least for more than two days. After about the second day, people started getting really sick of each other, and got very edgy. (Didn't help that the bus ride there was 31 hours.) Yes, well...I've finaly pretty much caught up with make-up work. Yay! I'm writing this feature story for journalism. I'm actually getting pretty into it. It's about Teenagers VS. Adults. It's pretty fun doing the research for it. Yes...but anyway....not talking about school anymore...it's evil. Our jazz band had a gig on Wednesday, and I got a ride, and was late getting there. I got there at the end of the last song...which is the song I had a soli in. Whoops...Oh well, it happens. Honestly, that's about all that's been going on, and now I'm off to the mall. I wish it would snow... *Ya Di Amore*",
    "Hehe, just finished dinner! Yum! I'm so happy right now. I don't even know why, I just...am! I'm talking to a bunch of my friends while writing this, which is always fun. Plus I'm doing homework, PLUS I'm watching Law & Order...how massively talented am I? Well, my day was pretty kick butt. Umm, no band OR music theory...very cool, so Kristen and I sat together and did homework and discussed Winter. Next period I hung out with Chris and Kelly for a bit (Alex too for a bit, since he was in Gym) and I left eventually. They started working on music, and...I just always end up feeling left out when they do, so, I try to stay away from those two together in general.Oh well, I went and sat alone in a practice room. Darn...no good stories for the newspaper to write about me. That was a great story, no matter how angry people are about the band comment. I wish people would have read the story actually, instead of reaching paragraph two and deciding it was terrible. Well, anyway, umm...EPVM was interesting. I'm getting nervous about my final. My brother said it was difficult...my brother with the perfect ACT AND SAT scores...arg. I just...wow, I'm so afraid of that test. I'm completely going to fail. Gym...oh jeez...two words  Commando Crawl  OWWWWWWWWWWWWWW  Good lord...that was one of the most painful...oh jeez...just thinking about it. Seriously, if you ever by some chance do that for high ropes...WEAR PANTS! Well, yes...wear pants normally, but don't wear shorts, make sure they are pants, because...it's quite painful if you don't. I made it through though, so it's all good! It just hurt...a lot.   Math, boring, shock shock.  Intervening thought: Why do I always write these while talking to Alex??  Lunch...was interesting. Just hung out with Kelly and Emily some, then Chris and Alex. It was cool...not much to it. Comparative Religion was boring...just, meh, presenting projects...and finally chem...boring, shock shock, and then, I came home, and did stuff, and that is the end of my day...therefore, I shall leave, and go kill alex...I mean...wait...you know NOTHING. You have no evidence...:)",
    "I got so many compliments on my hair! It was awesome, I got it cut, and layered last night, and I really really like it! It's shorter, but it's still really great! Right now I'm looking for new furniture for my room. I'm completely re-doing it, except for the floor. I like having a wood floor. Easier to clean if you spill something...which is inevitable with me. So, anyway. jusat waiting for dinner to be done, then all I have to do is study for my Science test. Arg...stupid science. Oh well, we have later arrival tomorrow! YES! I was hoping, and hoping, but I was upset because I wanted a late arrival day, and didn't think we had one, and then Bryan (with a y) was like, \"yeah, norkus you idiot!\" Ouch...oh well, how can one be sad when there's late arrival!?!?! Except, finals are next week, and I'm not ready at all. I should maybe actually study this time, considering I have not studied for finals yet since High School started....surprisingly though...I've done well. I don't get it. If I could just learn not to avoid homework, I'd be doing well. For most kids, it's the tests that make the problem, for me, it's the homework. Yay! Dinner...I'll write more later!..",
    "Avoiding homework...yet again, shock shock. plus i just painted my nails, and typing is something I can actually do without messing them up. I'll go back to homework in a bit. Umm, today was great! I saw *HIM* EEK! like four times. It was great...plus he actually NOTICED me, and spoke to me like...two out of the three times I talked to him. Exciting stuff.:) So, yes anyway, school wasn't bad. I went and sat with my best buds this morning instead of waiting outside the band room. It was fun. I miss seeing them as much as I do. Kathryn's doing well, she was just working on her paper, and of course Joanne and john were flirting. :) They make such a great couple. I get a little jealous at times though. I sort of wish I had someone like that. I'm still deciding who, and IF I want to ask someone to Winter. I would actually really like to go, but who to ask?? Certainly not *HIM* :) Couldn't do that. I figure I'll just go with a friend or something, and it'll all be good. OK...so, anyway, Kelly S. was cool as usual. She was complaining about stuff...as usual, but I love her to death just the same. Yeah, so...umm, went to band, Peter was gone, so...there wasn't AS much making fun of me as there usually is...oh darn. It was actually, ...scary as it is..., a bit unnerving. I actually got used to them all making fun of me every day, and it just wasn't balanced. Meh. Music theory was ok, but I'm still seriously thinking about dropping the class. I mean, I don't learn a lot, and I don't really enjoy the class too much. I could be doing more useful things with my time. Kelly..coyle that is got kind of angry with me about it. Oh well, I have to do what's best for me, and that may be what's best for me. EPVM...borring, as usual. We had a sub...so, whatever, nothing big. Gym..I went on high ropes!!! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!! I was sooooooooooooooooooooooooooo scared. You have no idea. It was terrible...except, fun! I was so scared when I first went up there, but Mehgan and I kicked booty! We got three done today. We could have gotten more if Allen hadn't been an idiot...arg. What a silly boy! He went up there just so he could come back down right away. That's the only reason he wanted to go up. So that wasted a good ten minutes. My watch fell off while I was up there and I totally flipped out! Eek! Kelly got pretty mad at Erica...I don't know...I hope no one's mad at me right now. I just really don't like when people are mad at me.   Math was...arg. I've finally learned the trick to his teaching though. He's actually a pretty darn good teacher if you can stay awake in his class. Eek, sorry, have to go...I'll write more when I get back from getting my hair cut :)",
    "Welp...haha, what a funny word, perhaps because it isn't a word? Yes, yes that is it. Well, anyway, I just finished my paper a bit ago, and now my mom is correcting it. Gulp! I've seriously forgotten how to write normally!!! Stupid Mrs. Kane, and her Journalistic style of writing! I can't write normally anymore, I really can't. I'm always like, \"Is that objective?\" Argh, so annoying! Well, I just vnted to Bryan with Y :) about jazz. I'm really trying to forgive Alstadt it just bothers me SO much. He never asked, never consulted me, didn't even TELL me for heavens sakes! I don't know, forgiving is the right thing to do though, so that's what I will do. This weekends been pretty cool actually. I'm feeling a lot better, and all I did this weekend was read...three books. Good books I might add. I also watched Pretty woman last night. Aww...it was so cute, almost makes me want to become a prostitute and look for love...except, not.  Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking. It is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil, but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails. -1 Corinthians 13:4-8  I love that...I do! It's so great, and so true. There was this other one I saw today...it's not exactly in the Bible, but I thought it was a GREAT quote nonetheless.  \"Be who you are and say what you feel, for those who mind don't matter and those who matter don't mind\"-Dr. Suess!  Again, so great and so true. Oh well, I really must go finish my conversation with Bryan with a Y, and then off to bed...ahh, sleep, I love you!! :) Ya di amore*",
    "Yeah, so avoiding homework right now and talking to Brandon. I'm really scared about this upcoming jazz competition. I know that we're not playing any songs that I really have to solo in, but still, there is Jumpin' at the Westside. I know I'm going to totally freak out...I just know it. Oh well. Anyway, I've been really sick for the past like...week. I'm getting sick of it..heh, sick of being sick. I first had a cold, then an ear infection...arg. Stupid sickness. Oh well...I'll come back and write more in a bit after I finish my paper. I'm determined to finish this thing.  Ya di amore...*",
    "RAR! OK, sorry, just love typing that! :) Well...just writing my music theory final...heh...last minute...rock on! Woo hoo! I had jazz today, I'm umm...doing better, I guess. When he pointed to me, I didn't like...bury my head and say, \"no, no, no! You can't make me!\" Oh well, s'all good. Umm, no finals today really. Lunch...went in at the end...then band (hardest final EVER) and then finally Comparative Religion...which, we didn't have a final in! yay! The rest of my day has been blah, so I'll write more later...maybe...if anything interesting happens. It wont though! :)",
    "OK, so I decided not to go. I talked to Chris about all that was bothering me, and it REALLY helped. Seriously, I love that kid to pieces. He's one of the best people to talk to when you're upset and need someone to listen to you complain. I really didn't want to tell him at first, but...he made me, and I'm glad he did. It felt good to get it out.I cried for the first time in a long time...perhaps since my Grandma's funeral...which was one of the things I was upset about. I just...really miss her a lot. I think I need to cry more...or get upset more, because, it just...hurts so much when it comes in big spurts, and...I don't know. I really want someone to like me for me...actually, I want someone to like me in general. I don't know what's so wrong with me...I really don't. I mean, sure...I'm certainly not good looking,but I'm not worse than some, and I try not to be a bad person, so...I don't understand it. Arg...I just...try so hard, and it feels like no one appreciates it, at all. Oh well, I'll be good tomorrow morning, it's just good for me to write, and talk to people I trust about this sort of thing, and it's not like anyone actually reads this thing anyway...so, heh. Anyway, off to bed. Goodnight.",
    "Once again...I'm upset about winter. Seriously, I keep telling myself to stop, because I'm being selfish, and I've got it better than like...99% of the population on this planet...and I'm complaining about a little dance, and it really is my own fault. I just should have asked someone. This is a real bummer. EVERYONE, and I do mean everyone has a date to this thing...RAR....must go...bye.",
    "Ok, tonight's entry is going to be pretty short. I'm really tired, and..I need a LOT of beauty sleep.  Today was a pretty ordinary day anyway. We had late arrival though, which was cool. Mr. Alstadt wont be here for the next two days...oh darn! I was looking forward to music theory SO much too! Well, yeah, anyway. Nothing interesting happened until I got called down to Mrs. Plumbers...DUN DUN DUN! I didn't do anything, just a mix up, so it's all good now! :)  Then, we had jazz, and I am going to kill Nathan. I wish he'd act more like a section leader, and Tom wont shut up. I think Steve ought to be section leader. He actually cares about sounding good. So...then i came home from jazz, had my lesson, and that was about it. I know this was completely boring, but people get mad if I don't write, then they yell at me, and...arg. So tedious. Oh well...I'm off to...errr, read, or something. then sleep.   Also, my great uncle Al died a few days ago. He was the coolest guy ever. :) So, if you could all say a prayer for his wife, and really close family, I'd appreciate it. :) Thanks everyone, have a nice evening.  XOXO",
    "I miss Heather. She was someone I could tell everything to. Wow do I miss her. :(",
    "Well, my day today was better than yesterday. It started out better though. I can usually tell what kind of day I'll have from the morning. I got my schedule changed today, and I straightened things out with Kathryn, so...she understands why now, which is good. I really didn't want her to be upset with me.   You ever feel like the whole world is against you, and hates you?? I hope not...it's not a great feeling. I feel like I have no real friends right now, no one that I can really turn to when times get rough, or when I'm upset. I miss Amanda, I miss Hillary, and I miss Kelly. I've just been so sad lately...and I'm not sure why. I guess I miss having a best friend, and...wow, I just really want a boyfriend. As pathetic as this all is, I do. I would think if I had a boyfriend, he'd be someone who listens to me, and...it's just not going to happen anytime soon. Yeah, I'm going to Winter now...but, now I realize it wasn't Winter that I wanted to go to...it was WHO I wanted to go with. I wanted to go with someone like I really liked...not a friend, and...it all just sucks right now. I kind of feel like crying, and...that's not me most of the time.   Yeah...so, feeling a little better, sorry...I was having an EXB moment. OOO, bad moment to have...very bad! Listening to some Dave Matthews...again, which is fun, so...yeah. Anyway...I have to go, people are actually IM'ing me. Drat. Maybe I'll write more later.  :I",
    "Well...ok...the Bucs won. Yay?? I'm not usually a big football fan, which is shocking considering everyone in my family loves football...and I'm in marching band. Man am I a weird kid. Well...anyway, we have a small problem now, I may be going to Winter...finally, like I wated, but...now Kelly's kind of out in the cold. :( We're thinking maybe she could go with Neil or something, since we all know Neil, and it'd be fun. We don't want to leave her out of this. I kind of wish that I could invite Kristen and Alex, and Taylor and her boyfriend, but...I'm not sure if Kathryn and Joanne would be cool with that. I'm just really confused right now. I can't believe we have school tomorrow. :( It feels like we don't...maybe because of the Superbowl, but...I don't know. I should probably just stop writing before I write something I don't mean to, which would force me to actually start looking at things with a different perspective. I still can't believe we actually placed yesterday...but, I really want to know how many bands there were....it's probably like marching. We got 5th...but...out of 5 bands. Whoops. Hehe. Except...that was last year, because this year...we rocked the kazba...and, I have no clue why I just said that. Wow...Catie, you're a weirdo. And now I'm talking to myself too...ok, sleep would be good now...yes...definitely...sleep...now...Good night all! Hope you have sweet dreams!!! :)",
    "Evereryone else is watching the superbowl,.so there's nothing else to do. I've been thinking about stuff. I said I wanted to go to Winter and everything...but, now that I am, I'm not sure if I really want to. Like, yeah...I asked him, but...I'm just going with him as a friend. I want to go with someone as more than a friend, someone I really do like. I mean...I love him as a friend, and I've known him for so long, but...I just wish I were going with someone I like as more than a friend. :( Oh well, it's still really nice just to be going. I wish it weren't so cold out, I need to go for a walk err, a bike ride or something! And just...think. I love people, I really do, but...I need my alone time. It was like poor Emily on the Disney trip. I just need to be alone! I'm actually getting sort of excited about Winter now. I'm talking to Joanne and Kristen, and they're excited for me...so...I'm getting excited too. I think it will be fun, especially with a group of people I like spending time with! Anyway...more later, I'm actually having conversations with people NOT watching the Superbowl! YAY!",
    "Wow...I can't believe it. I almost wish I could have seen more class AA bands. JSO didn't win any awards...which, completely shocked me. I mean...they are awesome. In the words of Alex, \"There must have been some seriously Godly bands if they beat JSO!\" But oh well...considering JSO isn't my band, we'll talk about Jazz Band...which places 3rd...probably out of 3 bands, but still. :) It was nice to place, and have JSO not...considering they're like...saintly, and...well...we suck. My soli went ok, not too bad. I guess I still have to play louder, and I didn't mess up any of the notes, messed up the timing a bit at 110, but..other than that, it was actually pretty good...I thought. Well, anyway...I'm not quite sure what's going on with Andy and Diane, but....it seems like Diane is happy, so...if she's happy, then I'm happy too. That's really all I wanted to write for right now. Haha, that amuses me. Write for right. OK...anyway, must be off to...I don't know...do something fun since there's no homework!!!! YES! :) Anyway, I'll write more later maybe.  :)",
    "Wow, I just...can't even write right now...I feel so terrible. All I have to say is that I'm an idiot.",
    "I couldn't sleep...I guess I get way too upset over stuff like this...but, I am REALLY upset. Supposedly Zach is in surgery, and Richa has internal bleeding...jeez. Why?? Supposedly there was also another accident in which a student died...it's all so depressing. I just want everyone to stay safe, and I really wish there was someone to talk to right now, but there isn't...everyone who would be online and who I could talk to is happily asleep. I seriously don't know whether to cry, or...what. I mean...I have cried...but, jeez, sometimes I wish I didn't care so much about people I don't know well. It wouldn't hurt as much if I only got upset over people I was really good friends with. It's just so unfair though. They're both so smart and nice...and....arg...just, why them??? Why the heck them....? I feel like I should tell the people I really care about how much I care about them, but...it's really hard for me to express my emotions like that. It makes me so sad though...so so so sad. I kind of wish I could go back to the days of elementary and junior high...at least people seemed safe there. No one ever got seriously hurt or died during either...  There's also that feeling like...I want to help somehow, but there's really nothing I can do. I mean...I'll pray, but somehow I feel that I should do something other than pray, something physical...I don't know anymore...maybe I just need to go clear my head....I was going to write about my day, but it doesn't really matter right now. I just hope they're ok...",
    "Why is it that bad things happen to good people?? I wish the quote, \"Good things happen to good people,\" was true, but it isn't always. Two really great people were in a car accident tonight, and they are in stable condition, but...still, it's terrible. They're upstanding people, and it shouldn't have happened to them. I hope they'll be ok, and I'll definitely be praying for them. They both contribute a lot to our school, and will continue to contribute a lot to the world when they leave High School. I guess I'm still trying to grasp onto the concept that bad things DO happen to good people...even if they're not just good people, but great people.   It also makes me incredibly grateful to have the life I have...to have a great family, have money, have shelter, have food, have friends, have...life. I just wish that it didn't take things like Kari's death...or Richa and Zach's accident to slap me in the face and make me realize it. I always get mad at people when I think they're being selfish or thinking too much about themselves, when I, myself, am probably being selfish.. But, I guess...as a friend just told me, \"It's times like these you have to have faith.\" I do. I mean, I say my prayers every night, but...a lot of times, I just say them to say them. I don't really think about who or what I'm praying for. I'll really think...and, I'll definitely be praying for Richa and Zach, and I hope other people can take the time to as well...",
    "i can't stop typing in this thing. I don't know why. My fingers wont stop. It's like they each have little individual minds of their own, except...I only type with two fingers. My two index fingers. I type pretty darn fast for that though. Lalalalalalala. Seriously, it is good to laugh a lot. Typing constantly is sort of keeping my mind off of truly thinking of the audition, and considering it all.   Hmmm. I'm talking with Brett, and Matthew. It's fun. I enjoy talking to both of them. I'm trying not to bring up the A audition though...   You know, I think I'd rather be known as prude and not be able to get guys, then a slut who can get guys. If I'm going to get herpes, I want to get it from someone I'm going to spend the rest of my life with.    Haha, sorry. I was just having a conversation about that with someone.  And I'm gone again...",
    "Sorry I sounded petty, and dumb and selfish.  I said haha a lot in that. Wow, it's good to laugh more. Hahahahahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahaha.  No seriously, am I always this loony?",

Haha. It made me happy. I think I'm going to make a list of things I don't like too but, I'll save that for my next really bad mood. I'm in a good mood now. The weather is actually semi-decent, and...hmmm, yeah! Oh well, I'm outta here for now. Peace. (I've always wanted to say that.)  XOXO :)",

    "Top Ten Reasons to Go Out With a Guy (These aren't in any real order.)  Intelligence Humor Kindness Good Morals Smells good :) Haha, had to be here. Good conversationalist. Fun to be around Being Hot. (Yeah, it's shallow, and it's not a necessity but, it is a plus.) Sensitivity. Yeah right, like this one's ever going to happen. Trustworthy.  Oh yeah! Just had a conversation with someone about this. Yeah, that'd be the perfect guy. Most definitely. Too bad none exist, or if they do, I'm just not noticing.  Anyway, my day was most excellent. I went to woodfield with my mom and shopped. Ah, it was so much fun. Hmmm, I think more people than I realize read this thing, so now I'm scared. I just put it on my profile for fun, except, now people know. They KNOW. Ahhh. Anyway, yeah.   Why do potentially good girlfriends pick terrible boyfriends, and vise versa? I've never understood it. Oy's so dumb. Almost as dumb as me but not quite.  So, I really have nothing to write, so...I think I'll stop now. Yep...stopping right.......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................now.",
    "Yeah, ummm, things are good. I made it. 5th chair, before Dan, haha, yes! I walked into band behind Dan, while Peter's saying, \"She beat you.\" Hahaha, the look on his face was the funniest thing I've EVER seen. It was so great. But yeah, I made it, and I'm happy about it, but...I'm still in a crappy mood. I want to go back to my old crazy self. I want to stop...being other people. I was having a conversation about this with a certain somone the other day, and he said he was doing that. Like...I take bits of other people's personality and make them me...It's so dumb. I need to be myself. I need to be crazy. I need to be fun. I need to not be shy. I need to be fun. I also need to be more trustworthy...but, that's a long way off. Maybe I am me. I'm really not sure. All I know is that I'm so incredibly confused about everything right now. I don't even feel like I care about the \"A\" audition. That's pathetic, I spent so much time worrying about it. I just feel like I care about nothing right now. I hate feeling that way.  Man, I'm just...not supposed to feel this way. I'm supposed to feel happy. Nothing's gone wrong, there's really nothing to complain about. I just...feel sad I guess.   Oh well, life goes on. I'm probably just having a bad day. Probably because it's cold out again. Argh, anyway, I'm off to go shopping with my mom at Oakbrook. Wow, I'm not even that excited about that. This is terrible. Oh well, I'm sure I'll have fun anyway.   I'll probably write more later. This is a writing kind of day...  XOXO",
    "Well, I'm really still not feeling bad for what I said. Jim mentioned it to me and thought I was talking about Dave K. Today. I was like, no no no no no! Haha. I actually thought Dave K. was mad at me today. It was weird...  Anyway, school was ok. Still didn't technically find out, but Mr. A. said I'm ok, and not to worry, so...I wont. Jazz was actually ok today, I was playing..and not THAT softly either! :) So, there's really not much to know about my day since it was boring and stuff.  I don't really feel like typing now actually. Nor later perhaps?   You know who it is, and if you don't, you're just not cool...  XOXO",
    "YES! I made Wind Ensemble, and I'm so happy...except, not really. I wish.  They didn't have the results posted today! Argh. I'm so mad. They said, \"We'll post them on Monday\" and then today they say, \"well, we're not quite done, we'll put them up tomorrow.\"  Argh.  Oh well, anyway. I must be off, just wanted to type about how frustrated I am that the results aren't out yet. :(",
    "Brilliant, absolutely brilliant!  Haha, I don't even know. I just had this huge urge to say that! Anyway, today's been better with thinking about the audition and stuff. I haven't thought about it as much, but yeah...dun dun dun.  Results come out tomorrow, but in the afternoon!!! Grrrrrrrrrr, that's so pooey. I just want to know for better, for worse.  Oh well, sucks to be me...except, not really. I like being me :)",
    "Wow, I was insane last night, and do you want to know why??? No, you already know why. I mentioned it 50 billion times last night. Ahhh...can't Monday come sooner??? PLEASE! Time is dragging by, and it's the weekend. Time on the weekend isn't supposed to drag by!  Well, I left for a while before finishing this to go read. I'm reading this book called Tangerine. I've read it like two times before, but, for some reason...I really like it. I don't know.  Anyway, there's nothing much else to write now. I don't think I'll end up doing anything today. My mom's leaving in a few hours for a business trip, so...yeah. Anyway, I think I'll go read more.",
    "Hm, haven't written in a while. Well, jazz cafe was last night. It was most excellent. I was really very surprised.. I wasn't expecting to have fun at all. I didn't even want to go. I danced all through JSO playing. It was super fun. Heh, anyway, I really have nothing more to say. I think I'm gonna go actually. I'll prolly write more later.   G'night you princes and princesses.  :)",
    "Wow, I am in such a better mood. I just talked to Christopher for like...2 hours. Man, I love that kid haha. He put me in the best mood. He's like my brother. It rocks like no other! :)  Goodnight you princes and princesses!  XOXO",
    "I just noticed...my entries have been getting more frequently sad. Because I've been more sad, or because I've actually been being honest with myself for once and admitting I'm upset?",
    "We go on...through the joy and through the tears. We go on...to discover new frontiers.....  I miss Disney Word so so much :(   I bet I'd be happy if I were there right now.",

    "Yeah, it's kinda like that...                 But not really. :)    Haha, sorry. I really had no purpose for writing that. I'm just sort of avoiding doing this government crossword puzzle. Man, it's taking for fricking ever!!! Holy cow. It's not even funny. This thing is impossible, and it's worth more than the test. Heh. YaY government? RAR! OK, anyway, I think my weekend on average was pretty decent. I really didn't do all that much. Just kinda hung out. I cleaned my room though!! Like...really cleaned, I washed my floor (since it's hardwood) and cleaned all my furniture and everything! It's amazing. Except, it's all weird, because everything's all neat, and everything's where it's supposed to be. It's confuzzling. Ah, I love making up words. So much fun. It turns out I didn't have a gig according to Brandon. He better be right, haha. Yeah, so, umm, I think I was supposed to do something with Kathryn today, but...I ended up going to lunch and stuff. Oopsies. I hope she isn't too mad. I talked to her on the phone for a while, and she seemed ok, but...kinda mad since she knows about Joanne, Diane, and me going out to lunch. Eeks. Oh well, we'll do something this upcoming weekend. Haha. Coffee smells good. Matthew and I are talking about coffee. I think I'm the only person who doesn't actually like the taste of it. I like the smell though, so good enough. Can you tell I'm rambling? I know I can. I'm procrastinating like no other. Oh well...back to the drudgeries of doing homework. :(  XOXO",
    "I think I upset Diane. I asked her a lot of questions about being vegetarian today. I didn't mean for them to upset her. I've just never known anyone who is vegetarian so, I sort of wanted to know about it. I was just curious, that's all. I hope I didn't upset her. I hope she's jjust having a cranky day or something. Haha, no..I don't hope she's having a cranky day. I hope she's having a great day, but...she seems to be kind of upset. I just hope it wasn't me.",
    "Sometimes I really wish people didn't read this, and other times, I do. People actually hear..or see what I have to say with this thing, but...that's not necessarily a good thing. Hmmm, I'm talking with Andrew. Haha, he thinks I'm a creepy kid. This is funny.  Anyway, umm, I think I might have a jazz gig, but I have no clue.Eeks. Oh well, they can't blame me when I knew nothing about it! AHHH!  So, I went out to lunch with Diane and Joanne today. It was a lot of fun. I felt kind of bad though, because Diane and I were talking about all this marching stuff, and Joanne doesn't know about it and stuff. Every time I'm with band people I do that, and I really don't mean to, because I feel like I'm making people feel so left out when I do that. It was fun though, reminiscing. I kind of miss freshman year, but 'eh. Not that much. I like sophomore year too. It's cool. Hehe, anyway. Must be off. Heh, seriously, if I hadn't gone crazy years ago, I probably would now...  XOXO",

    "You know, I was just thinking, Harry Potter needs an invisibility cloak to get around Hogwarts at night, but, even though I have white hair, I'm still invisible to most. Most of the time I feel like second best, or third. With the exceptions of a few people, like Kelly and Emily for example. Yeah, they're best friends, but they ALWAYS make me feel like I'm just as important to both of them as they are to each other. But, then there's some people who seem to always make me feel like I'm not good enough. Like, \"oh, I guess we'll call you after we make sure everyone else isn't busy.\" Argh. It's just not cool. I try to ignore it, but it's difficult. Oh well..just...a though.  XOXO",
    "I didn't think I'd be this upset over my brother leaving. :( I'm really upset about it. He just left, and...I don't know. I'm going to miss him a lot. It just makes me sad to think how little time I really have left to spend with my family. I'll be going off to college in two years, and then start my own life, and my own family from there on. I'm one of very few people who actually enjoys spending time with my family. I really get along with them. They get me away from the shallow selfishness of High School. They have actual intelligent conversation. I'm just...sad :(",
    "Hm, ok, so, there really isn't anything else to do. So, I decided, I'd just keep typing until either my mommy calls or gets home. I'm going out to dinner with my family tonight. It's my brother's last night here before he goes to Australia tomorrow. I think I'm actually going to miss him a lot. He's there for me a lot, and I can actually talk to him. It's kind of surprising. :( Oh well, at least I'll have my bathroom to myself, but that's not enough. I'd rather have my brother here I think. I don't know, I've just gotten so much closer to him in the last few months and stuff.   Anyway, back to non-depressing stuff. Oh wait, my day was sad. Haha, not totally actually, just my speech. It was so bad. I'm never practicing for a speech again. It messed me up. That, and bringing my whole outline up there with me. Oh well, I don't think I really wanna talk about it/write any more about it. Too painful to think of.  I wore a skirt. I like skirts, but I don't. It's weird. Anyway, my mom just called. She's on her way home from the airport, YaY! I'm off to....I don't know, get a life.  Byebye!",
    "Still can't get to it. the servers are too busy. I can sign in and stuff, but I can't put an entry in. Poo.",
    "Oh my gosh. Professor Semanic can eat flamingo poo! ARGH! I DID let him know I wasn't going to be there for jazz cafe with an e-mail, and he wasn't able to do it anyway! What the heck is that mans problem? He has a huge one. RAR! Sorry, just a little angry. I don't think he's fair or justified, and he's yelling at us for not having consistency in rehearsals and...heh, guess what? HE CANCELLED FOR THE NEXT TWO WEEKS! Wow that man makes me mad, but...yeah, oh well. I can't write in my real diary because I can't get to it. My real diary is online, but...it's locked and whatnot...so, yeah. I can't get to it, that makes me mad too. :( Oh well, I think I'll go try again.",
    "Oh yeah, that gig last night, did NOT do wonders for my self esteem. It loweered it. Stupid gig, we did horribly. RAR! Anyway, the gig tonight went well and all. It was kinda fun. Kelly drove me, and on the way home we stopped at McDonald's. It was so cool! So, we got some chow, and then rode home listening to the soundtrack to Now and Then. We sang really loudly and I danced. It was soooo fun!! I love Kelly S. I love Kelly C too! Kellys just rock my world basically!   Anyway, I swear, I really will stop writing in here.     Maybe?",
    "Yeah, so, today was pretty ordinary.  Hmmm, I don't even remember half of what I did today. I was so out of it. Haha, i wore my black hoodie with the hood up, and nobody could recognize me at first because they usually go by the hair. I also looked pretty stoned. Like, five people this morning told me I looked stoned. It was funny.   Oh, the juniors might have to take the ACT all over again. Man, that'd suck so much. Supposedly four ACT answer booklets were stolen. they had an assembly about it and everything. It's all pretty messed up.  Man, I hate group work so much in math. It's the most messed up thing in the world. GRRRR!   I completely lucked out on my government packet today. I don't really wanna explain how, but...I felt I needed to thank someone for letting me get 33/35 when I did the packet after the tes right before we graded it in ten minutes. Too much to explain, but it was excellent. Anyway, I think I'm sick of typing in this public area again, so...I think I'm going for the whole private diary again. I still type in there, but i also type in here. I think maybe I'll just type in there from now on, because two entries is too much for a lazy person like me.",
    "OK, so, I'm indecisive. I decided that I wouldn't stop writing in here, well...for now. I just decided to write in here today instead of my actual journal. Who knows why? My mind works in mysterious ways.  Anyway, school was ok today, nothing too special. I saw a lot of my friends, and had a good talk with Emily over lunch. I think Dave saw that one entry in here, because he's been a lot nicer to me in the past couple days, or at least since Jazz Cafe. Maybe he's just gone back to his old self. I really hope so. I missed the old Dave. He was so different from most guys. RAR, guys are pooey.   But, yeah, anyway, I didn't do much this past weekend. The only real thing I did was hang out with Chris, jim, and Alex. It was actually a lot of fun. Haha, Alex's mom fed us dinner. It was really good. Then we went to Chris's to watch Swimfan and the Matrix, which I hadn't seen. Wow, that's such an awesome movie. I usually don't like those types of movies, but I liked this one. It was so cool!   I have to go soon. We've got a gig at Ellsworth Elementary. It'll be fun. I wonder if we get to see the kids play. That'd be so cool. It'd do wonders for my self esteem.   Eeps, anyway, I'm outta here.   Actually, before that, I heard this really mean saying the other day that I thought was funny, but...argh, it was so mean. I feel terrible for laughing at it. They said, \"I'm outta here like the fat kid in dodgeball.\"  That's terrible, is it not? I still can't believe I laughed then, I feel so mean.  Anyway, I am out of here. I probably wont write again tonight considering the amount of homework I have.   Goodnight you princes and princesses! :)",
    "Well, I think I'm going to stop writing in here because I found a good site to write, where no one can see it, so...I'll actually write what I need to, and what I want to. I may start writing in here again at some point, but...'eh, I highly doubt it.",
    "It's weird. I hate eating in front of other people. I always feel so guilty. I don't know why. I eat so much at home. I should be like, half the size of mexico.",
    "Yeah, so...I spent the evening with Chris. It was fun. I think he thinks I'm really annoyed with him though, and I'm not at all. I'm jujst annoyed with most people right now, and I'm irritable. I can't wait for summer to come. I NEED summer. Hmmm. Oh well, haha, we went to chili's. It was interesting. I haven't been there in so long. I got this really big dessert. Haha, so good...but....too much. I think I'll go running tomorrow.   But, anyway...that's really all I want to say right now because I can't really type everything I need to in this journal.   Byebye.",
    "I beat the system. I'm supposed to be researching for a speech, and I couldn't get on here from the school computer at first, but I can now. YES! Ahahaha, I beat the system. I'm typing in here, and I'm not supposed to be during school. I'm a rebel!!!",
    "Well, since blogger is DUMB, my entry for today got deleted.   Stupid blogger.  Oh well, I really don't feel like typing it again so, I wont.  Maybe I'll write more later.  Bye.",
    "I'm not intelligent I'm not pretty I'm not funny I'm not a slut I don't like most people I'm not nice I'm too loud but too quiet I'm too untrusting I'm selfish  Please, if you think of anymore...let me know.",
    "Today, was good overall. Yes, very good.  :)  Turn the faucet off baby See we're floodin' the floor now What a shame  Drown the neighbors out baby Our little love tub's out the door No more rap, nor more dub The steam Is almost hidin' you away In our tub of love here I'll scrub all over you and you can scrub... All over me  Just move your leg a bit  And I'll move mine We'll get so clean Our love is lookin' fine  I'm shining now and so are you In our tub of love, life is new We're almost perfect now, me and you.  I really don't take those words in a sexual nature. They just make me think. Sure, they could be meant in a sexual way but, I didn't take them that way.  So, yeah. There's no one right now thankfully I think. I'm kind of glad I don't like anyone. I don't have to feel all awkward around people, and it's just so much more complicated when I do like someone.  I'm really avoiding my science lab. I wish I could have gone to Kohl's with Brandon. Oh well. I talked to Chris on the phone for a bit, and still avoided doing my lab.   I've been talking to Erica a lot the past few days. It's been nice. Anyway...must go actually do homework. :(  Poo.  Bye.",
    "OK, Chris isn't mad at me, but...I'm still sort of down. I don't know why. I truly don't. I'm sure there's some reason deep down inside and I just don't realize it, but...ARGH! It's super annoying.",
    "Dag nabbit. I think Chris is mad at me now because I'm an idiot and was short with him last night because I was in a bad mood. I wasn't mad at him, just...maf in general. Argh, oh well.",
    "Talked to Kathryn on the phone for a bit. I needed it. I'm glad she was home. :)  I think I'm going to call someone. I don't want to be alone tonight.",
    "I'm lonely. No one around to talk to, to hug, to just be with. Being with a big group of people wont help it. I'll still feel alone deep inside. It's hard to understand. I need just the right person to be with right now, and I don't even know who it is. I just, need to be with someone I can trust, someone I really care about. I  think I want to spend tonight with Joanne and Kathryn and Kelly and Mary Clare. I need people I can talk to, have real conversations with, cry around without feeling stupid. I need a shoulder, and yet...nothing is there. Just air.The air I need to live, the air I need to breathe, and yet...it's doing nothing for me right now. I'm still sad. People just distract me from it for a bit.",
    "I just took a shower. I love showers. They always make me feel so good.    Today is going to be a good day!! No matter what!",
    "You know....Diane really is an amazing person. She's terrific at cheering me up. So is Joanne. And that's all I've got to say about that.",
    "Well, I'm less angry now after having talked with a certain someone. Thanks a lot. You know who you are. I don't know. I think I just needed to talk to a specific type of person tonight. I'm glad I'm not so angry anymore though. I don't even know why. I don't get it. I mean, I was super angry, and just so dissapointed with the world, and so annoyed. I'm sure this will all be better tomorrow though.  Goodnight",
    "??????? - (1:31:56 AM): hell your like the best person i know  One of those people is doing a darn good job of cheering me up. Thank you.",
    "The only people I'd even want to talk to right now are my mom, Ryan, and Alex.",
    "I don't get why I'm so angry/annoyed with some people and perfectly ok with others.",
    "Darnit. I am so angry and dissapointed, and sad right now. It's not cool.",
    "You know who the coolest person in the world is? Someone who's so special they deserve an award? Ryan. Ryan Dewitt. Thanks Ryan. I love you!",
    "Oh yeah, I found out Peter doesn't hate me like no other. I'm glad. I don't like thinking that people hate me. Not a good feeling.",
    "The last few days have been ok. Just kind of chillin. I'm sick though, and I've been feeling like crap all week, so, I finally stayed home because I had no huge obligations. Thank goodness. I'm starting to feel better just from getting some actual sleep.  I had marching, \"tryouts\" both Wednesday and Thursday Yesterday was basics. It wasn't nearly as hard as I thought it was going to be, thank goodness. I'm actually kind of glad I stuck with marching, and promised my mom I'd do it. We watched the senior movie with the song, \"We Go On,\" in it. It's a song from my Freshman year show. It always makes me so sad.  Anyway, scariest conversation ever last night. I was talking to Chris, and he's like, \"What if I just told you how I really felt about you?\"  I started flipping out, because I couldn't tell if he was serious or not, because I couldn't hear his voice, and I was like, \"Ah, he's already had a crappy week, how the heck am I supposed to say this nicely.\"  And, someone asked me later that night, when we were talking about people we like, \"Why don't you just go out with Chris?\"   I don't think people get that we're just good friends and nothing more. I don't think I could ever go out with Chris. Ever. It'd be way too weird, and...ick. Just...no. No offense to him of course. I mean, he feels the same way, so....people, just...forget it. Chris and I don't like each other, and never will. Well, like as more than friends. I'm just sick of it.  I wish people could realize that just because I have guy friends, doesn't mean I like them, or want to go out with them. I had a conversation with Bryan about it. It's actually really easy to talk to Bryan. I'm glad he's my friend. And no, I don't like Bryan as more than a friend.  Enough said. You get my point. Byebye.",
    "I was reading a past entry of mine, and I said how I could never forgive him for what he did to her. I don't think it's my place to forgive in the first place. It's her's. I certainly don't think what he did is right, nor do I condone it, and certainly I would kick his scrawny butt if he ever did anything to hurt her again, but it's still not my place to forgive.  I doubt anyone's going to understand this entry at all, but I needed to write it for my own personal well-being.",
    "I put that conversation with Katharine in here because it makes me happy. It jut made me feel really special, and it will be good for me to look at when I feel sad. Who knows if she really meant it though? Maybe she does that with everyone. Oh well. I really don't know.  My head hurts, and my nose hurts, and my eyes hurt from rubbing them.  I just hurt!  Dumb colds. My mom gave me her cold she had for the past weekend, and I have an eye doctor appointment tomorrow. Those aren't good to have when your eyes are watering alll over the place! :(  Oh well, not much to say about today. It was pretty boring. I'm doing marching band down I think. Brandon got section leader, but...so did Peter. It's confusing. Brandon got section leader for marching, and Peter got it for music or something. It's all very confusing.I guess Brandon's highter in the chain of command though, which is good because Peter hates me like no other.  Ah, too much to do at once.  Nothing more iinteresting to say anyway.  Byebye! :)  Overall mood for the day: Happy",

It just...kind of hurts sometimes to have no one like you. No one care for you.   Everyone teases me. EVERYONE. I get kind of sick of it sometimes. I like it sometimes, because it is a lot of attention, but then there's those times when it really truly hurts. I hate when people make fun of me because I can't see well. You want to make fun of me for it? Then fix it! I know I can't see well. It wasn't exactly my choice, so...back OFF! Argh. Even when I tell people not to. They stop for a bit, then go right back to it. Tell me, why is it so easy to pick on me? Why? What is it about me that makes it so incredibly easy? I mean, I'm certainly not miss America, but I'm a pretty good person for the most part. I try to be nice, and honest, and have good morals, and people just keep shooting me down. Why try to be a good person when all people do is shoot you down? What's the point? I'll tell you something. There is none. I like being me, but it's hard sometimes to do the right thing when everyone still makes fun of you. I don't see people who do wrong things get shot down. It's cool now to go get drunk on a Friday night. It's cool to have STD's because you've had sex with however many people. It's cool to be mean, and heartless. Well, heh, cool people suck I guess.  I'm really just sick of it all. I respect very few people at my school. I can't wait for summer to come to be through with it. Then, the next year, I can go back and do it all over again. Dislike people all over again. Be upset over how people do wrong things CONSTANTLY all over again.   I want to stay in Michigan. I want to be away from it all. I want to not see almost everyone here. I know I wont respect the people there anymore, but, it'll take longer because I don't know them. I don't know that some of them actually have the potential to be good people. I don't know that some of them just do it to be popular.  For what? For four years of true misery? For four years of hating yourself but loving the attention? For four years of wasting your time on people you probably wont see again?  Some four years.",
    "Today's been kind of a bummer. I'm in a bummed out mood, and I really want to see him. I know I shouldn't like him, and maybe I don't really, but...man, it feels like I do. I'd like to do something with him outside of school. I think he'd be pretty fun to hang out with. Oh well. Tonight I'm going to see Bruce Almighty with Kathryn hopefully. It'll be a fun time. YaY! Everyone seems so busy, and my weekend seems SO boring. I'm not sure why, but...'eh. What I want is to see someone I can't, and that doesn't hwlp things.   Yesterday was a good day. School was pretty boring as usual, and then last night I went to One Acts with Kelly, Kathryn, and Joanne. It was really funny, and Mary Clare tugged her ear FIVE times to say hello to us up on stage. :) It was neato. During intermission we went down where a bunch of band people were, and there must have been somethin in the air, because we were all acting CRAZY! Wooo! Anyway, it was fun and...yeah, now I'm off to go to the movies with Kathryn! Woo hoo.  Byebye.",
    "I'm not sure what kind of mood I'm in. She said it was no big deal, but...I still think she's mad at me. She said not to worry about her, and...I guess I'll try. I just care about her, and never ever want to say anything that would make her upset. :( I need to think.",
    "Wow, so, yes. Yesterday was fun. i went the whole school day without talking. It was interesting. I get $20 though. YaY! But, yeah, I couldn't write down that I was in a bet with someone, or speak obviously, so...I had to get one person to guess. Luckily after that one person guessed it was easier, because I got him to tell some people, etc. It was fun. So, then I went home, couldn't find my dress for the concert and freaked out. Haha. I found it eventually, but...still. Um, I went to the concert, and it was fun. We didn't suck horribly shockingly. I was amazed. Concert band was ok. Kristen and I sat there and found six good things about them. 1.) Red bow ties, 2.) Recognizeable melody, 3.) Good beat, 4.) When they stood up, they made this arch type thing, tallest in the middle, and shortest going out, 5.) Mr. S! 6.)Hmmm, I do not remember. Oh well. We did come up with six.   So, it was fun overall, but, I was glad to get home and sleep. It was exciting. I actually slept the whole night without waking up once. I was so tired I guess.   Today was ok. Just a pretty normal day until marching. Well, actually...marching was pretty normal too, but...yeah. We just did washington post, like we do every parade, and then went outside and marched for a bit. Fun stuff, 'eh? Hmmm. Brandon drove me home, and here I am. Heh.  I feel terrible though. I have this joke with my friend. She's incredibly skinny, and it's this joke about her being fat, and complaining about it and whatnot, but...I didn't think before I put this joking away message on that said how I don't like when people who are skinny think they're fat, but...I really didn't think before I spoke, or...wrote I guess. So, of course someone who I really hadn't intended to hurt, or even direct that toward saw it, and...I think she got upset. I was looking at her away message, and she seemed kind of upset, so...I looked at her diary thing, and I saw. I just, feel so terrible I tried calling her but she's eating dinner. I really need to talk to her and straighten this out, because it wasn't ablout her. Argh. I REALLY need to be more careful of what I say. Heh, this gives me a good example for my speech on how people need to think before they say things though.    Yes, she got online. Phew!",
    "Well, I had a pretty busy day. Lots to write about, but I'm just so exhausted I can't right now. I Will write about it tomorrow. Wow, lots of, \"writes\" and, \"rights\" Wheee. Yeah ok, I'm too tired. Byebye.",
    "You know. Heh, kind of funny what this all makes me think. He's actually never ever had the right to do that. He's never earned it. He's had so much time, and nope, it's more important. It'd probably take him twice the time he's known me to earn the right.  I do realize no one has any idea what I'm talking about. I guess it's a good thing.",
    "Argh!!!!!! Get AWAY from me you jerk! Get away, get away, get away. I don't like you now. I don't want to speak to you right now. I don't want to speak to you for a VERY loooong time. I know I will in a few days, but for now, STAY THE HECK AWAY FROM ME! I'm not gong to say I hate you because I'll probably regret it later, but...I certainly feel like saying that. YUCK! GET AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!! I seriously just need to get that out. It's not all out yet. I'm still extremely mad, and extremely annoyed, and EXTREMELY upset.   Who are you to tell me that when you can't even control your OWN life? Who are you to tell me that when you are in absolutely no condition to? Who are you? Huh? I'll tell you who you are. A huge jerk. Yeah, you tell me this when you have the right to, and I'll listen. Tell me now, I'll come close to hurting you. BACK OFF!!!",
    "Well, today was an ok day.  Band was normal, except for being in the auditorium, which stinks because it's so warm under the lights in there. Music Theory, thank god he didn't talk. I couldn't have handled it today. Chem, we did a lab, blah blah blah, nothing interesting. Health, we went over the female reproductive system and whatnot. This girl Kat in my class is fearless. She asks questions noone would even THINK about asking. And she shared some...umm, interesting facts about herself that I didn't need to know. Let's just put it this way. before she left she said, \"Well, now that you all know my menstruel cycle.\" Eeks.  Speech was boring. We took a quiz dealy thing and such. I have to change my topic for persuasive because I can't get enough sources. Heh, my speech is Friday too. :(  Lunch was normal. Math we took a reallly hard quiz, and gov. was fun as always. Right before government though, like, in the hall on the way, I got into one of my quiet modes. I'm not unhappy or sad, or even angry, I just feel like being quiet. Everyone gets all scared when I go into my quiet mode though and always ask what's wrong twenty thousand times. Oh well.  I'm going to go make my dinner now, so...yes. Goodbye.",
    "Oooo, someone bet me that I couldn't be quiet for a whole day of school. I'm definitely taking the challenge. Definitely. Ahahahaha. It will be most excellent. Seriously. The only trouble with be explaining this to people.",
    "I feel like being quiet. It's always so funny when I feel like being quiet. People always ask me, \"What's wrong?\" \"Are you ok?\" Catie! What happened?\" Nothing. I'm perfectly fine, perfectly happy, and...perfectly quiet. It's ok to be quiet isn't it? People act like it's a sin. Dag nabbit, just let me be quiet. Hehe. Anywho, I'm off to go eat dinner/do something constructive...maybe?",
    "I'm going to smile like nothing's wrong, talk like everything's perfect, act like it's just a dream, and pretend its not hurting me...because one day it won't and everything will be ok.",
    "We come to love not by finding a perfect person, but by learning to see an imperfect person perfectly.",
    "Talking to Christy right now. It's actually really awesome. I miss her. I can trust her so much it's unbelievable. She's probably the single most trustworthy person to ever be in my life other than my mom.",
    "So, yeah, I didn't end up doing anything. Oh well, I guess it happens. I guess I just didn't want to spend my Saturday night alone. Argh. I wish I could drive. That would be really nice. Being able to drive would be a total escape for me. I could go places by myself and not bring anyone else, or have to get a ride from anyone else. It would be so super nice. *Sigh* I just want summer to come. I want to go to Michigan. I want to feel the sand beneath my feet, and the cool waves splash against my legs. :I want to walk alone along the beach at sunset. I just want to be by myself in a beautiful place. I think I'm going to go read now...  Bye...",
    "Haha, I changed it again. Wow, this is fun. Wheeee. OK, I think I'm definitely having WAY too much fun.",
    "I got a new template. It's an ok template, but I love the name of it. \"Aliens Stole My Wallet.\" Haha, I guess I'm easily amused.",
    "Life seems pretty good right now. I have a lot of homework, but other than that, life seems good. I think I'm going out later. YaY! I'm not spending my Saturday night alone.",
    "So, I went to Michaels to get my shirt for Chemistry and the whole Ty-Dyeing thng. I wanted to get a long sleeved one, but I couldn't find one. :( Oh well, such is life. I wonder what I'll do tonight...",
    "Diane-Orange Derek-Red Kelly-Red Matthew-Orange Kristen-Orange Joanne-Yellow Mary Clare-Sky blue Brett-Blue Emily-Yellow Dave-Sepia Bryan-Bright yellow Chris-Orange Brandon-Green Me-Brown  I wanted to remember what color everyone has said so far, so I'm writing them down.",
    "Haha. Wow, I was SUCH a loser as a child. It amazes me. I'm still a loser, but man....  Alphabetizing crayons. Wow. Psh.",
    "I'm glad I'm secure enough with myself to be able to stay at home on a Friday night without feeling bad.",
    "OK, so, I've come to the conclusion that if I were a crayon, I'd be brown. I feel bad for the brown crayon. Nobody likes the brown crayon except a few. No one really respects the brown crayon. They all need it at one point or another though, to draw a tree or brown hair, and they don't realize how useful the brown crayon is. Really, how many times have you really thought how much the brown crayon is used? And yet, no one likes it. The brown crayon will probably explode someday from so many rejections, and it will be terrible. All the little kids always go for the pretty colors. Blue, purple, pink, but it's not the appearence of the crayon so much. It's how useful it is. What it does. The brown crayon is helpful, and is always there even though all the kids reject it.   I get philisophical when I'm tired....or just very weird. :)",
    "Things have actually been going ok this week. The week is going by really fast thankfully, but I know next week will drag by SO MUCH! I don't really feel like typing anything right now, so...maybe I'll write more later. I have to go make my dinner anyway.",
    "I miss Victoria. I miss how she would always come when I called her. I miss how she'd do anything for me. I miss how she would sleep with me every night. I miss how she would only come for me, and how she only liked me. I miss how everyone would say, \"Catie, go get Victoria, you're the only one who can get her.\" I miss how she ALWAYS sensed when I was sad, from anywhere in the house and would come find me to cheer me up. I miss my cat. MY cat. She was truly mine, and she loved me. She loved me for what I am. She didn't want to change me. She didn't want to make me any different at all. She loved me for being me.   I don't miss that I found her lying on the floor dead. What a horrible way to lose something you love SO much. I really miss her. She'd be hear listening to me, crying with me, cuddling with me. I can't believe I'm letting myself think about it again. After I found her lying there, motionless, I wouldn't let myself think of it. I couldn't. :( Why am I doing this to myself? Crying wont make her come back. The one thing that truly loved me and was completely devoted to me.  Feels like I just fell face forward and a piece of that glass was wedged into my heart.",
    "I would love people to just answer this question honestly. What's wrong with me? Why can't I seem to get anyone to like me other than Matt? Really? I don't understand. I really don't. I think I'm a pretty decent person, but maybe I'm just fooling myself. Maybe I've been fooling myself all the time. I'm never going to find someone. Never. There's not even one person who's remotely interested in me. Everyone seems to find someone, and I get to hear all about it, and...heh. Wow. I love that people trust me, and tell me stuff but...I guess, it just hurts when I realize that no one's talking about me to someone. No one likes me, has ever liked me, or will ever like me.   Right now, the glass is not just half empty, it's empty and shattered.",
    "So, what to do, what to do. I don't know. I don't even know what I'm thinking. Life seems very confusing right now. Michigan. Michigan. Michgan. I just need to keep thinking of it, and I'll be happy. :)",
    "Haha. OK, so Angie and I made up a good analogy.  Abstinence is like Thanksgiving dinner. You don't eat anything all day because you know dinner will be really really good.  YaY for abstinence!",
    "My head says no but my heart says yes. I can't follow my heart though. It will end in pain and humiliation. I know it will.",
    "Even if I did like him, there's nothing I would ever do about it. Why am I such a chicken?",
    "They say this is the best time of your life, and I don't necessarily doubt it but there's some pretty crappy stuff that goes along with it.",
    "OK, so, I'm super tired, and super anxious to get back to reading my good book right now so, I'm remindng myself to write about this stuff later.  -My day -Cleaning out my locker/after school adventure -Tyler -Going to Finding Nemo -Kathryn's little outburst at the boys in the car  :)",
    "I still can't even fathom what he did to his first girlfriend.",
    "I'm actually surprised at how angry I am. I mean, I am....extremely angry. Angrier than words can express. Wasn't it enough to do that to one person? Now you want to ruin someone else?  Heh, another problem. I can't be around her if she's with him. I wouldn't be able to stand it. I'd want to kill something or someone.",
    "AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Darnit, thanks for ruining everything you jerk. Thanks a lot.",
    "I must say, it really makes me sick. Really really really. And she's being dragged into it. I think she's caving in and there's not a gosh darn thing I can do about it. Even if I were to tell her what a slime he is, and what he did to his old girlfriend, she wouldn't listen. She thrives on going against what people tell her. She would just probably go out with him faster or something. ARGH! Seriously, this all makes me sick. Incredibly sick.  He's going to hurt her like he hurt his last girlfriend. Man, that kids probably going to be an abusive husband someday, but the problem is, he seems ok normally, but he's so impulsive, and argh. Abusive relationship. He's going to hurt her. I can see it now, but she wants someone so much that she'll go for him. AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH. This is so bad, and it really really truly bothers me.   On a happier note, I talked to Joanne on the phone for a long time tonight. It was so nice. Ah, I love her! But, I just can't get this other thing out of my head. He's going to hurt her, and not just emotionally, but probably physically too. He's going to ruin her, crush her, strip her of her dignity. And in the end, I know I'll be right, but it wont feel good to say, \"I told you so.\" Whenever I'm so rarely right, it's bad if in the end it wont feel good to say that. Sure everyone deserves second chances, but he had so many with her. SO many. Argh.   I need to sleep.....",
    "Haha, I just realized I wrote \"my kelly's\" like they're mine! haha! Alllll mine!",
    "OK, I've decided. I'm not letting myself lose touch with my really good friends like my kelly's and Joanne and Kathryn, and Emily and stuff. No way no how. I'm just not going to let it happen. I'm determined! HMPH!",
    "OK, so, I've had a vision!!! I see the light! Ahhh!  OK, so when Kelly becomes rich and famous, and I go to one of her concerts, and then try to get backstage, the guards will yell at me and be like, \"GET AWAY YOU WHITE HAIRED NUTCASE!\" And I'll be like, \"But I know her!!!\" And they'll laugh in my face, and then Kelly will come up and say, \"Catie my love,\" and I'll laugh REALLY HARD into the guards faces. Ahahahahaha. It shall be fun.",
    "As pathetic as this song is musically, I still love it...  So we talked all night about the rest of our lives Where we're gonna be when we turn 25 I keep thinking times will never change Keep on thinking things will always be the same  When we leave this year we wont be comin' back No more hangin' out 'cause we're on a different track And if you got somethin' that you need to say You better say it right now 'cause you don't have another day  'Cause we're movin' on and we can't slow down These memories are playin' like a film without sound And I keep thinkin' of the night in June I didn't know much of love but it came too soon  And there was me and you And then we got real blue Stayed at home talkin' on the telephone We'd get so excited and we'd get so scared Laughing at ourselves thinkin' life's not fair  And this is how it feels As we go on We remember All the times  We had together And as our lives change Come whatever  We will still be friends forever  So if we get the big jobs and we make the big money When we look back now will our jokes still be funny Will we still remember everything we learned in school Still be tryin to break every single rule  Will little brainy bobby be the stock broker man Can anna find a job that wont interfere with her tan I keep, keep thinkin that it's not goodbye Keep on thinkin it's a time to fly  And this how it feels As we go on We remember All the times We had togetther And as our lives change Come whatever We will still be friends forever  Will we think about tomorrow like we think about now Can we survive it our there Can we make it somehow I guess the thought that this would never end And suddenly it's like we're women and men Will the past be a shadow that will follow us round Will these memeories fade when I leave this town I keep thinkin that it's not goodbye I keep on thinkin it's a time to fly  As we go on We remember All the times  We had together And as our lives change come whatever We will still be Friends forever",
    "Yeah, so, Im kind of sad. It was the seniors last day today, and I don't even really know any seniors, but it just makes me think how much closer I'm coming to being a senior and leaving and having to go off on my own, and not seeing my friends anymore. Then, of course, it reminds me of next year where not only do I lose my best friend, but other very close friends. I'll luckily still have awesome friends senior year, but...I'm still going to miss my friends leaving after next year. I think I'm most worried about Chris. I can talk to him so easily, and spend time with him alone without any pressure, and....I feel so comfortable around him. I'm worried that after he goes to college, I wont ever see him, nonetheless talk to him. This is why I truely despise getting a specific best friend. They leave at some point, or you grow apart, or something. It's the same thing that happened with Christy and Amanda, and....well, Kelly will always be my friend. No matter where we are. She is the one person I am positive I will keep in contact with after High School. I have complete faith in that. I've known her for so long, and she's just Kelly. I know we'll talk at least periodically to each other throughout the rest of our lives. I know I'll go to her wedding, and well, hopefully not her funeral. Everyone else, I'm not so sure. I hardly talk to Christy anymore, and Amanda, the only reason I really talk to her is because my mom's best friends with her mom. I still do love them, and would still take a bullet for each of them, but...I just don't talk to them as much. Then my other really close friends...Kelly C., I think our lives will go in completely different directions, and we'll grow apart. I'll be there for her when she becomes a famous clarinet player in the CSO, but I have a feeling after High School, we wont talk as much. Kathryn, I don't really know what will happen. I think we'll try to keep in contact, but just end up growing apart. Like, the calls will somehow end up being few and far between. Emily, oh...I don't know. If she actually does go to Europe, that's the end. Keeping in touch with someone on another continent is really difficult. I hope for her sake she does get to go though. Joanne's already going off to England, and who knows what will happen with that. And....just, wow. I need to stop thinking about this, and my other close friends. I haven't even really talked about any of my guy friends. I'm stopping myself now.  I hate this. I've had such a great blessed life. It's just hard for me to accept change at all.   Tell me that we belong together....  And I'll be your crying shoulder...  Drat. I've managed to truely bum myself out.   :( Things just seem so sad right now.",
    "What scares me most, is that I wouldn't be surprised if that happened....  Haha, I love talking when no one has any idea what I'm saying.",
    "I miss my cat. No, no, no, no, no, not now. I'm not thinking of her now. Nope, I'll start to cry. I've managed to push it to the back of my mind and force it to stay there, and that's what I'm going to keep doing.",
    "What do you do when the only person who likes you is the only person you truely dislike?  He's the only person I'll ever get to like me, and I can't even like him one bit. JEEZ! Figures.",

    "I've been writing more and more in here lately. I wonder why. *Sigh* I don't know what's up with me. I mean, I'm happy...but, I'm sad at the same time. I feel like I'm missing something.

    "I was looking at some of my very fisrt blog entries. Wow, I've really changed a lot. It sort of amazes me. Anyway, I found this somewhere in there, and I want to re-post it so that I keep remembering it.   Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking. It is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil, but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails. -1 Corinthians 13:4-8  :) I love it. I love the Bible. I love God!!! Sometimes, I think people think I'm some heathen atheistic person, and I'm completely not. It's completely the other way around. I just like to worship God in my own way, and my own way is a quiet way. I don't like to push my views on other people. People who try to push their views on others really bother me. I love God, and have complete faith in him. That's all I need to know. If other people don't believe that, nothing I say will change their minds. That's why I don't understand why so many wars are faught over God. Don't you realize you're doing what God doesn't want you to do?? You're killing, and  argh. Has this war over God ever been resolved?? No, because not everyone worships God in the same way or worships him at all. It bothers me so much. Let people believe what they want to believe.   Wow, ok...sorry, venting.",

    "AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!! I am SO stressed right now. So so so very stressed. I'm so sick of him. So sick of him. He does everything he possibly can to annoy me. It's like he trys to. It's like he wakes up in the morning and thinks of ways to make me mad.   I just went online and realized that there's no way I can have a conversation with anyone right now. It's stupid to even consider trying, it really is. I'm just going to say something I don't mean or something. Argh. I feel so low and terrble and...lonely. I know I have awesome friends, but I guess I just feel lonely right now. I guess it's normal. Everyone's allowed to feel lonely. Heh, I feel lonely, yet at the same time, I want to be left alone. I don't want to see anyone at school tomorrow. Maybe a few people, but not most. I want people to just leave me alone at school tomorrow. Not talk to me, not nag me, poke me, tease me. None of that. I want to see only a few people like my lunch gang, and them.   I wish I could see Amanda. Man, I miss her so much. I wish she hadn't moved to Texas. :( I wish I could see Heather too. If she's changed some of her ways, I want to see her a lot this summer. Argh. Is today over yet? Is tomorrow over yet? Heh, I'm not exactly following my quote, \"never let the sunset on tomorrow before the sun rises today.\"  I had a really strange dream the other night. I'm not sure if it was good or not. It was with someone I'm really close to. I don't know. It was weird. I guess i'm still analyzing it. Who knows? I just need to do this speech crap so that I can go read and sleep.

    "Yes! Finally! This wasn't working before for some odd reason, and it was making me mad. Man, I feel so sick. My tummy really really hurts. :( Stupud guys. Seriously, they NEVER have to deal with anything. Grrr.   So, today was an ok day. Only 4 more days of actual class. Wind Ensemble, I went to the writing center and actually worked on my speech outline. I was amazed, I actually did work. Then, music theory, gosh, I want to get away from that class SO SO SO much. Seriously. Yuck. Oh well. He just talked, and talked, and talked, and blah bah blah!!!!! Argh. It seriously didn't end. Chemistry was ok. We just got a ton of really confusing notes. Argh. Poo on Mr. K. Sometimes he's ok, but sometimes I just want to choke him. RAR! Ummm, Health was ok. Really boring and pointless. Busy work. Grr. We wrote stories with 15-25 words we found in the chapter. It was really very pointless. Speech was ok. I didn't have to give my speech. Someone else gave a speech on Plastic Surgery though so...yikes. Oh well. Umm, lunch was ok. Math was boring. I think I actually understood what we were doing though. Government, we just watched 12 Angry Men.  It was really a pretty boring day, and I think I'll go work on my speech now so I can go eat dinner and go read, and then go to sleep early. Wow, that would be nice. OK, Byebye.",
    "Goodmorning. I really hope today goes well and that I don't have to give my speech and that Mr. A isn't there. You kinow, something just occurred to me...if Alstadt were to ever by some chance read this, A.) I'd never have a chance of making WE again or B.)I'd feel terrible or actually...both! Yikes. Maybe I need to stop writing about Alstadt in here. I know I wont because he makes me mad a lot, but...maybe I can try to talk about him less. Anyway, I'm off to school. YaY? Byebye!",
    "OH MY GOSH OH MY GOSH OH MY GOSH! BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD IMAGES!!!  Ewwwww!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   I think I'm going to be ill...",
    "I'm really worried. I haven't talked to Alex lately. I don't want to lose him as a friend. He's such an awesome person. I don't ever want to stop talking to him.",
    "Haha, you know what phrase I've always liked? \"Shifty character.\" Haha, so funny. :)",
    "Hey, I finished my music theory composition! YES!!!! I finished one thing on my list! How awesome is that??? I never called *boy* I swear I was going to, but I couldn't work up the courage. OK, so, I wasn't going to. I can't do it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I talked to a cool kid on the phone anyway, so...it was overall an ok Sunday evening.",
    "Hmmm, you know, it's kind of funny. I never realized how little I mention my dad. I was talking to someone on the phone tonight, and they asked me where my dad was, like as if he were gone or something. Kind of funny. My dad's a cool guy. I really get along with him. I just get along with my family in general. they're cool. I mean, I don't talk to my dad about personal stuff like I do with my mom, but...I still talk to him. Anyway, I think I should go quickly get some research for my final speech and whatnot, then I'm off to bed, so tired! Byebye....",
    "Things to do:  -Finish music theory composition -Finish...or, start my final speech and do the outline for it -Go outside and play basketball for a little bit -Have a cookie...with milk. -Call *Boy* :) (Like this one will EVER happen) -Get over the fact that it's NOT SUMMER YET! -Buy new earings -Stop writing in blog to avoid homework and doing most of these things!!  I'll add more as I think of more later.   Man, thinking about everything though....life is really good.",
    "AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I loathe homework with the deep burning passion of a thousand fiery suns!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",
    "Man, I am SO avoiding homework. Grrrr. I don't want to do it soooo very much. I'm finishing my music theory thing and it bites. I loathe music theory with a burning passion. I shouldn't have taken it. I don't fit in. I suck at writing music, and I suck at music in general. Grrrr. Oh well. My patience is wearing thin with someone right now. It's getting harder and harder for me not to get angry with him for even little things. He's aggravating me so much, and he just...really knows how to make me mad. It's almost like he works on it or something. Oh well, I'm out of here like the fat kid in dodgeball. Poor fat kid. :(",
    "Yep, I've decided. Definitely. Funny how spending just an hour and a half with your girl friends can make things seem so SO clear. So, that is what I did this evening. I went to Kathryn's house. We just hung out and whatnot. It was a lot of fun. I love being with them. Kelly wasn't there, but oh well. Things were fun just the same. Then after that, I got to drive! YaY! It was fun. Anyway, I'm kind of tired, so...I'm going to bed now, I think, hopefully, if no one IM's me. If someone IM's me...it's all over. I'm so addicted to AIM. Oh well, such is life.",
    "OK, I can stop pretending to clean. Man, why am I so scared of bugs? I saw this little ant, it wasn't hurting anyone, but it was coming close to me and I started FLIPPING out. I grabbed some Fantastik, and sprayed the little thing to death. Well, now I feel incredibly bad, but bugs scare me SO SO SOO much. Anything with ore than 4 legs scares me. It's just not natural to have more than 4. Like...centipedes. *Shiver* I don't even want to think about this actually.   So, anyway, I think I'm going to Kathryn's tonight, yay! So, I should probably go eat dinner and get ready for that and whatnot.   :)  I'm quite content right now.",
    "I don't know why I'm so excited to go to Michigan, but I am. I can't wait. I was talking with Lauren last night, and we were talking about partying and stuff, and I really want to. I mean...REALLY want to. I just want to have some fun and let loose, but I promised myself I'd never drink and stuff. Stupid promises. I don't even know why I do, I just really want to have fun. I'm sure I can have fun without drinking anyway. Sometimes, I guess I just want to be included in it all. I wanted to go with Pat and his friends and my brother when they all invited me a few months ago. It would have been awesome, hanging out with older people, but I didn't because I knew they'd drink and get high and stuff. I know they'll all be doing it, but at least Conor doesn't drink, so maybe I'll hang out with him when they're all drinking and stuff. I asked Max if he could bring up some non-drinking/single/non-attracting Sara guy. Heh, he said that wasn't possible with the Sara part. Heh. Anyway, haha, I thought part of my conversation with Lauren was quite amusing so I'm puting it in here.   Lokiluna13 (11:24:21 PM): hey, I'm a ruel breaker all the way Lokiluna13 (11:24:29 PM): I do drugs all the time and drink baby bear 321 (11:25:37 PM): hahahaha baby bear 321 (11:25:44 PM): can i quote that? Lokiluna13 (11:25:56 PM): lol baby bear 321 (11:26:00 PM): thats soooo goin in my profile Lokiluna13 (11:26:08 PM): I do!! Lokiluna13 (11:26:12 PM): haha baby bear 321 (11:26:35 PM): lemme guess baby bear 321 (11:26:43 PM): u drink pop and u take advil?? Lokiluna13 (11:26:58 PM): yeah...but....both at once, and I'm telling you, you're NOT supposed to do that. Lokiluna13 (11:27:02 PM): It's dangerous!  Haha, it just makes me laugh, but anyway, we've got plans. Big plans. We're going to get the guys back this year. We just have to think of some really really good prank to use. Ahahaha. We will. We're also going to go pick up some yokels. It will be VERY amusing.   Eek, must go. Have to pretend I'm cleaning. I'll probably write more later.",
    "I told Chris there was one thing I was positive about with Ryan last night, but...I'm not so sure anymore....",
    "It's like a game with us. A neverending game and I'm so sick of it. Three years of games.",
    "I am so in love I am so in hate I just can't comprehend it, uh You get me so high You get me so low I can't show what I'm feelin' Never was the type To let someone like You get under my skin, no Tried like hell but you Didn't care for real You stepped on my feelings  See I love to love you boy And I love to hate you But I got to let you know I'ma have to let you go See I love to love you boy And I love to hate you But I got to let you know I'ma have to let you go  Love to feel the love Love to heal from pain Is there really a difference? Wonder who is right Wonder who is wrong I'm just feeling some tension, uh You can't compromise We can't coincide We should really be chillin' 'Cause I've wasted so much time Love is on the line I've made my decision Yeah  It's useless to try and work things out Don't need all of the stress You're not worth it I'm tired of all the ups and downs So goodbye, I'm leaving Made up my mind  See I love to love you boy And I love to hate you But I got to let you know I'ma have to let you go See I love to love you boy And I love to hate you But I got to let you know I'ma have to let you go  It's useless to try and work things out Don't need all of the stress You're not worth it I'm tired of all the ups and downs So goodbye, I'm leaving Made up my mind  See I love to love you boy And I love to hate you But I got to let you know I'ma have to let you go See I love to love you boy And I love to hate you But I got to let you know I'ma have to let you go",
    "Well, I finished my letter to Ryan, now to give it to him? Do I? Don't I? I really don't know.",
    "Boys are stupid, don't throw rocks at them, throw huge giant shards of glass!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Haha...wow...I'm looooony. looony loony!!!",
    "Whooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!! I'm crazy, loony, psycho. I've definitely reached the highlands. Man, they say you need drugs and alcohol to get a buzz, I say just stay up extremely late! WHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!  Hahahahahahaha. Goodnight, goodnight!",
    "I don't know anything at all and I'm somebody else It could take years to find you, it could years to find myself And I don't need to hear your answer I just need you to see That I think it's time to break down these walls that we throw  Am I still breathing have I lost that feeling Am I made of glass 'cause you see right through me I don't know who I am and you're the only one who sees that I can't ask these questions that cannot be answered today And even if everything goes wrong and we start to fall apart I will understand where you are, I will understand this by myself And I don't need to hear your answer I just need you to feel Like there are no boundaries at all  And how far have we come, too far to throw away the past Will you be there waiting for me I have to ask what we are, if I ask today it just won't last So I'll be here waiting for you  Will we ever feel this good again - Not today  Will we ever feel this real again - Not today  Will you ever be mine again - Not today  Will we ever feel this real again - Not today     Stupid world. People suck.",
    "I had a very good very...interesting day. I don't think I want to write about it in here though. I was going to but I think I've decided against it.",
    "Haha. One more person I found out about who reads this thing. Eek. I really really need to be careful what I write. I guess it really doesn't matter since this is sort of my diary, and since I don't write anything in here that's too personal anyway   Luckily though, I CAN write about Ryan, because he never reads this.  I'm worried about tomorrow. At first I was supposed to go to Great America with him all day, but...I decided not to since there were tons of people I know going there, and I didn't want to see people I knew all day long. So, then we decided we'd do something else like bowling or a movie or something, but...I'm having second thoughts. I think if I do see him, I'll start liking him...again. I realllly don't want that, because a relationship with us just doesn't work. I obviously broke up with him for a reason last time. Why bother puting myself through that again? It just hurt me and him, and it took a while to get our friendship back. But, I guess I'm not really being a friend to him if I don't want to see him. I know if I do, I'll end up going out with him at the end of the day, and yeah...I've thought about doing that, but...it's partly because I just want to be in a relationship with someone. Hmmm, oh well. Tonight was fun. I went to Peter's party. It was excellent...well, I guess. It was alright, but I didn't know anyone, and Chris and Brandon went to play video games. Luckily, Kelly was there, and Annie too. I'm glad I'm friends with those two. Hmmm, so I left the party kind of early and just hung out with Chris for a bit. It was cool.   That's really about it. I guess I'm just really worried about this thing tomorrow. I felt like I was being a jerk to Chris. I was listening to him, just...not all there. Sigh. I guess what wants to happen will happen. I shall see, I shall see.",
    "YaY! OK, so, my day...  I slept in since I had my lunch final, and I went in late and went to take my government final. I'm glad I didn't bother studying for it. I got a 97% on it. That rocks so much. I wasn't sure whether or not to study, so, I didn't. Sweet. So, after that, Kelly, Joanne, John, Kathryn, Mary Clare, and I all went out to lunch. We went to THREE, count 'em, THREE! restaurants. The first two were just too full, so we ended up going to Einsteins. I wanted to get a peanut butter and jelly bagel, but I thought that I should wait til I was with Diane haha.  Sometimes I feel like Diane doesn't like me very much, like...I annoy her for some reason, or she doesn't trust me for some reason. I feel like I should say sorry to her, but I don't think I did anything. I'd love to be better friends with her, but I don't think she wants to. Oh well, I'm not giving up yet. Anyway...after we went to Einsteins, we went paddle boating. It was so fun. Haha. It was a little chilly, but still tons and tons of fun. Oh, I wouldn't suggest ever trying to switch with someone in the backseat, especially when you have four people in your boat. Good times, good times. Hmmm, then we went to Starbucks, but I don't like coffee, so I just got a fruit drink thing. Yum yum yum. Then Kathryn's mommy picked us up, and drove us to joanne's. we just hung out for a while. We did Karaoke, haha. We also played spoons, except...we used forks. Yikes. It's really dangerous. I cut myself. :( But, Joanne gave me an Elmo band aid so it's all good. The Elmo bandaid completely made my day.   I'm pretty sure we managed to make Kathryn mad. I think she's hiding it because she didn't want to ruin our good time, but I am pretty sure something we did got her mad. Oh well. Tonight, I'm going to Peter's party thing. I wasn't sure I wanted to go but so many people are going, so I figure I should give it a shot. Maybe I'll have a blast. Eek, I hope. So, Chris is driving me there in like an hour or so, or something. Heh. Fun day. Tomorrow will be good too. I'm probably hanging out with Ryan the entire day.  :)   Yes, tomorrow will DEFINITELY be good. We decided not to go to Great America since so many people I know are going.   Anyway, I think I'm off to do something...errr, constructive?  HAHA NOT! And why not? Because there's NO SCHOOL! WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!",
    "Today was so dull and boring I don't even really want to write about it. Heh. Oh well, tomorrow will be fun at least.",
    "My day was excellent, superb, wonderful! I was really dreading it. Honestly, this was maybe my easiest day, but I was still dreading it. Why? Because of meany pooface Alstadt. He's such a jerk sometimes. I'm sorry, but he is. Anyway, I just sat around before school IN THE BAND ROOM! I couldn't believe it was open. Heh, funny. It was open and guess who wasn't there? Anyway, I went to go take my speech final, and it was easy and all. I got a B on it without studying at all. It's ok. I'll still get an A in the class. I could have gotten a 68% on it.Excellent. Anyway...I did that, then went to band. Since we took the band final on Friday, there was nothing to do. I KNEW if I stayed Id' have to sort commencement music since we had to let it all dry out yesterday. So, Kelly and I decided to be rebels! WOO HOO! We walked to burger king and got some food. It was awesome. We got kids meals, and we got the toys that went along with them! It rocked! So, then we walked back, and no one seemed to notice. :) Excellent. Alstadt took attendance, but...no big deal. They aren't going to come after me with two days of school left. Also, my parents wouldn't care anyway. So, then, unfortunately, we had to go to music theory. It wasn't as bad as I thought. I proved Alstadt wrong though! YES! He said I couldn't go from A major to C major and have it sound good. HA! Not like my composition was good, but it still sounded ok, and Mr. A was wrong!!! WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!  Anyway, that was pretty much it today. Oh yeah, with our kids meals, Kelly and I got these scratch and sniff thing. Oh my gosh, there was one with a foot, and it smelled SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO bad. Wow! Terrible.   Anyway, I'm done. I think I'll go...I don't know, do someonething constructive?",
    "So, kind of a depressing day.  I woke up at about 10, couldn't find my shoes, searched alll over the house and finally found them. So, I go take my shower thinking, \"lalala, everything is good. I found my shoes.\" OK, maybe not. I find out my dress had a rip in it!! GRRR, so, I had to have my mommy fix that really fast, and I actually got there on time. We actually had to have commencement outside. Luckily we got to go in after we finished playing though. The poor seniors didn't. I really am surprised they didn't have the ceremony inside. Oh well. So, our music got ruined, my hair/dress/feet all got SOAKED! ahhh. Oh well. So, after that I unexpectedly got a ride home from Chris, changed into some dry clothes, and then we went to Chipotle and met Brandon and Bryan there. It was a lot of fun. I actually got something there. I've never actually had food there. It's so yummy. Mmmmm. I definitely couldn't finish it all though. So, yeah, then we went to Coldstone. I got chocolate ice cream with gummy bears. Yum. So very good. Then Chris and I just drove around and talked for a bit, and then, I came home, and I started to study for math, but I just couldn't do it, so...I decided to write. Haha. Lala. So, that was my exciting day.   It's kind of funny when someone who's your friend thinks if they tell you something they're thinking, you're going to hate them or something, and then they tell you, and you don't at all. It wasn't what you were expecting, because you were expecting to actually be mad at them but you aren't at all. And it just makes you love them more because they're so honest and truthful, and they trust you so much. I feel really trustworthy right now, and that's all I have to say. I'm sure no one has any clue what I'm talking about. Sorry. Oh well, I don't think anyone reads this anyway, do they? Oh well, no more talk of this ever.  I must be off to study. HA, like that'll happen.",
    "Argh. Tonight so many things are hurting me. I feel like my heart has been ripped apart so many times tonight. Like, it was ripped apart, and started healing, then ripped apart again. It hurts so much.",
    "So yeah...I just love being the one not paired up with anyone. Feels fantastic. Really.   I'm a big fat liar.",
    "There's no way I'm letting this bring me down dag nabbit.",
    "I don't know man.  Things just really seem to suck right now. I went out to Pizza Hut tonight with my friends but it just wasn't as fun as I was hoping for. I'm just in such a bad mood, it's hard to have fun. I feel like I'm compltely wasting my summer. I don't know how or why, but...I do. I just feel so mad right now, and sad...  Who knows? Maybe it'll be better tomorrow. :(",
    "Hm, ok....so, everyone left for Germany which kind of stinks but I've been doing tons of stuff!! It's amazing! I'm still writing to Chris and Kelly, and whatnot, but I've been hanging out with all my other friends here. I actually went to the pool yesterday in the middle of the day, and didn't get burned! Well, this one part of my face did because I must have missed it with my sunscreen, but still! I was so happy, and it was fun! Then I went to Kathryn's with Joanne and Kathryn, and we just hung out. It's kind of weird just being with both of them. Oh well. Then, last night I had a sleepover at Joanne's, and it was fun. I actually got a lot of sleep surprisingly. Heh, except it wasn't really good sleep, because sleeping on a florr REALLY hurts. Hmmm, we watched the Princess Bride! I'd never seen it before! It's really really good! YaY! It was fun! Oh, and haha, Joanne really can't take not knowing something. It was so funny. Kathryn said something that we couldn't tell Joanne, and Joanne REALLY wanted to know. It was just humorous. She usually knows everything, and the one thing she didn't drove her crazy. Woo, fun times.  So, today I've just been busy cleaning and whatnot, and tonight I'm going out with Katharine, and Diane, and Steve maybe, and Jeff maybe. It will be most exciting hopefully! :)  I must get going. I've got quite a bit to do actaully.",
    "I really don't think it's ever going to happen. :(",
    "So, my day was pretty ok. I gave my Daddy his gifts and stuff and that was fun, and other than that I really didn't do much. I played the computer game Civilization. Oh my goodness, that game is ADDICTING! Wow. So, anyway, everyone's leaving tomorrow. :( I'm going to miss everyone. A few of my really really good friends are going, and it'll be hard without them here. I doubt they'll miss me at all. Oh well.   Oh yeah! I cleaned my bathroom today too. Blah. I hate cleaning my bathroom. I hate cleaning altogether actually. I hope I'm rich when I get older so I can hire someone else to do that, or I'll try to marry someone who likes to clean. Ha. Like that'll happen. I mean the marrying part, not the finding someone who will clean part. :)   Anyway, talking to kelly. I'm going to miss her. Her and Chris the most. :( I'll write more later....maybe.",
    "You know, it's funny. I seem to like him less and less every day. OK, it's not funny. It's terrible, but really. He makes me so angry, and so mad almost every time I talk to him. Argh. Some people really annoy me.",
    "So, I was looking at my very first blog entry which isn't even on this page, and I just thought...\"wow Catie, you were SUCH a dork.\" Yeah, that entry actually scares me. I wonder if in 7 months I'll think the same thing I did of my Novemeber 14th first entry into one of these. I'm kind of surprised I've actually kept up writing in this. I've never actually kept a real diary. I've always felt like I was just whining to paper. I don't know how this is different, it's just whining to a computer screen, but still....I've kept up with it. I wonder how much longer I'll keep uo with it. I don't intend on stopping writing anytime soon. Hmmm....interesting thoughts. 'Eh, I'm not in much of a reflective mood right now, so I think I'll go read and wait for a good storm to come! :)",
    "Hm, ok, so that was odd. It just started raining a bit, and then it got sunny again, and now cloudy. Weird. I wonder if storms will be coming through all day. I actually like storms as long as they aren't too...errr....deadly...yes, that's it. I usually like to read during storms, like, snuggle up with my blanket and all my stuffed animals and just read and listen to the rain and thunder. It's fun, but...I guess I have a weird definition of fun.   I can't believe they're all coming home Monday. I'm pretty excited, but time here has also gone by extremely fast. I've gotten to hang out with a lot of people, and meet new people, and have a blast. 13 days til Michigan too. Plus, I found out that we're almost positively going to Italy for Thanksgiving this year. I'm SO excited. I love Italy. I really do. It's one of my favorite places in the world. :) And if my mom gets the bonus she might be getting for this thing she's working on...too hard to explain...then we get to fly first class. :) That would be so awesome. First class on an overseas flight. I could actually sleep. Not that coach is all that uncomfortable for a 5'0\" person like myself, but still, that's so awesome. I'm really excited, and I can't wait to go. I think though, that if the marching band goes to the Macy's Day thing, I'll miss it, which would not be cool...but still. I love Rome.   Hmmm, everything's too quiet in my house. I'm going to go check it out. It makes me nervous when my house is quiet.",
    "I was having a chat with someone this evening, and they asked me if I cried a lot. It was kind of funny...seeing as I almost never cry. Only when it's something really important to me, or when I just bottle everything up, or when I just listen to a gorgeous song, and emotions come. Most of the time, that's when I cry. Music makes me feel emotions I didn't even know I had. It's amazing. Although I don't want to go into it as a career, I am extremely glad it's part of my life, and I love people who can make great music. I truly truly respect it. Ah, anyway, I'm off to sleep...seriously...",
    "Haha, wow...I'm having so much trouble typing tonight. My fingers are being clumsy for some reason. I have to type like every word twice. Grrrr.",
    "Blah, blah, blah!! I'm not tired, and I actually, for once in my life, don't feel like reading. I don't know why I'm not tired at night. I woke up at a resonable hour today. Hmmm, I think I need to stop writing in here like a loser and go talk to my friends. I was talking to like...5 friends, and all the conversations ended at the same time. Poo. haha. Katharine just told me I should go sleep. Yes, yes I should. Will I? Probably not unfortunately. I should really take my friend's advice. They give good advice. On sleeping at least.  I heard Chris and Mike and both Daves were drinking in Germany. It kind of upsets me. Not upsets...but dissapoints. I'm surprised. I mean, I heard they didn't just drink but got drunk. I was especially surprised about one of the Daves. I have talked to him about drinking before, and I asked him if he ever drank, and he was like, \"NO!\" I remember that so well, because it almost seemed as though I'd offended him with the question at the time. Like, \"How could you ask me that? Of course I don't drink you silly girl.\" Ah well, I guess it's their choice, not mine. They can do what they want, but I guess I lost some respect for Dave.  So, I'm off to go talk to cool people because....err...because they're cool. Wheee. I think I'll go to sleep feeling happy. :) Plus, I finished my book, which is nice. I'll need to find a new one though. Ah...I'm off....",
    "Hmmm...I'm debating on whether or not to do this. Probably not. I'm a chicken. A dumb chicken with it's head cut off. I always thought that story about that chicken who lived for like...15 hours after he had his head cut off was interesting...I think it's terrible that someone cut the chicken's head off, but...I still thought it was kind of interesting. I wonder what science is behind that.",
    "You know, I just realized something. I always worried about how people probably think I'm weird because I go to the park and swing on the swings and listen to my music when I need to think. Well, I don't care. Everyone has a place that they think in, and that just happens to be mine. I don't even know why. It just relaxes me. It helps me filter my thoughts.

    "Sooo, today I'm just going out with my family and whatnot. It'll be a good time. It always is. I also have to clean my room if I want to get my new furniture. My mom's good at coming up with bribes. Grrr. Ah well. I'm off.",
    "Wow. I have a darn good life. An extremely extremely good life, and I'm just so happy about it. It kind of scares me sometimes too though, like...I'm too lucky. Like, eventually my luck will run out and terrible things will happen. Ah, who knows? I guess all I can do is be thankful for what I have now, and pray that it continues.  Hmmm, moving on to goofy mode. Wow, I'm such a loser. I get so weird at night. I should look into this. It's got to be something about the brain late at night. :)   Oh...and gummy bears taste delectible at 2:22 in the morning.",
    "OK, so I didn't sleep. So what? Haha. It doesn't matter anymore. I'm not going to Joanne's again tomorrow. Haha, oh well. We WILL watch it sometime. I'm determined now. We've set the date for July 9th now lol. It'll happen...sooner or later. Probably later, but it will still happen.  Hmmm, so, I'm talking to this kid right now. He seems really cool actually. And that's all I'm saying. Yes, that's definitely all I'm saying. Haha. So, I'm going to go finish talking to people and go read or something since I'm not particularily tired.",
    "Heh. OK, as of right now, I've decided on neither. Both are out. Hehe. Wow, that leaves me right where I started at. Dag nabbit. This is pooey, and so is my computer, it doesn't like me much. But what does? :) Tra la la, I had my grilled cheese earlier. It was yummy, and tonight I'm having chicken parmigan. Hmmm, I wonder how you spell parmigan...  Oh well. I think I'm going to I don't know...go be a loser someplace than on my blogger website.",
    "Hmmm, so, I was supposed to go to Joanne's, but she couldn't since she's got to do a lot of work on her mom's closet still. That's ok with me actually. I'm not feeling great anyway. It's just one of those, \"blah\" days. I think I'll probably go make myself some grilled cheese, and just, read my book or watch tv. YaY! Mmmm.....grilled cheese. I'm so addicted to that stuff. I really am. I think I need to get on a better sleeping schedule, but even if I do, I'll go off it again in MI. So, I guess there really isn't much of a point, because I refuse to go to bed at 9 every night when I go. Tra la la. I'm in a weird mood. Quite a weird mood. Hmmm, I just flung my pony tail thing across the room...Wow, I'm so weird. There's nothing really to type about. I still havem't decided, although I did find something out that could be helpful. Eh, I think I should just forget everything and wait til college. YaY college. Maybe there will be mature guys there. I hope....Joanne's lucky, but it's funny. I don't know how they are going to be apart a whole year next year. Joanne really misses him and it's only a week that he's gone now.I have faith in them though. I think they're going to be one of those high school couples that makes it, and actually stays together. They're like, made for each other. I'm really happy for both of them. :) Anyway, I think I'm going to go make my grilled cheese now, and read or something. Hmmm, I never sign this thing anymore. Oh well.",
    "I've figured something out. Guys don't like girls like me. They like mysterious girls, or funny girls, or interesting girls, or even girls that seem innocent. Hmmmm. I don't think I want to change myself, but....grrr. It still makes me angry. 16 days...only 16 days. It'll be nice to get away from Naperville. Very nice. I can't wait to go on the jetski's, and go tubing, and.....just lie in the hammock and read. :) So relaxing. *Sigh* ARGH! July 11th, WHY WONT YOU COME SOONER??? Oh well. Such is life. Hehe. Anyway, off to sleep. Nighty night.",
    "Well, at least this thing finally works. I guess I can write a little about my night, but not too much since I want to get some sleep since I'm going to Joanne's at 1:00 tomorrow. Tonight was ok. I was supposed to go out with Erica, Brett, and this kid Roger, but it didn't end up happeneing so I just went to Joanne's instead. Heh. It was alright. We just watched the first Harry Potter movie, and Kathryn kind of ruined part of the fifth book for me. Sadly, I think se did it purposely. Like...the way she said it, and when she did it, it felt like she knew exactly what she was saying. Kelly and I obviously weren't too happy. Oh well. It was still ok. Everything with Diane is all good now! :) I'm so happy it is, because I just...I don't know, things were awkward for a bit I guess.  Man, everyone seems so aggravated and irritated lately. It's weird. It's like everyone needs a vacation from each other. Like everyone needs to get away. I don't know, it's just odd. Man, I wish my mommy were home. I need to talk to her about this decision I'm trying to make. I don't know. I kind of wish I had someone who I could talk to about this, but...there are very few people I trust, and even them, it's not easy to talk about people I like with...  I guess we'll see what happens. I'm thinking of making a list of why I like both, and then deciding, but that just seems so...I don't know. I feel like I should know. I feel like I should feel in my heart which one's right. I guess....  Who knows?  I think I just need sleep. I was absolutely looony five minutes ago haha. I guess I've gotten into serious conversation with the person I'm talking to so I've gotten more serious, but I love when I can be goofy. I love just feeling silly and not caring what other people think. Woooo.   Anyway, I think I'm just going to go to sleep soon, maybe read a few pages of my book. Not Harry Potter. Ahh....byebye! :)",
    "Argh.....I wrote a whole thing and blogger was dumb, and didn't publish it.",

    "So, I just went out with my mom and stuff today. It was fun. I found the furniture set I think I want, but it doesn't have the bed I want! Grrr!  I love it other than that, so...I'm thinking I'll probably get that set, and get an unfinished bed and paint it a fun color, or finish it in the color of the other furniture. Sooo, I'm going out again soon and I'm trying to decide whether I want to actually dress in something nice. I think I might just stick with my comfy pants. I love them. :) They make me happy.   Hmmm, It's only been 12 days since summer started...wow. It seems like a LOT longer. It hasn't even been two weeks. Yay though!! I'm looking forward to Michigan SO SO much!!!!!!!!!!!! AHHHH! I seriously can't wait. Not only am I going to get to see people I don't get to see often, but I'm going to read Harry Potter too :) YaY!!! Hmmm, this is being dumb so...it's not posting it. Oh well, I'm sure it will eventually. Blogger is weird....",
    "Wow, I really hope she forgives me. I did have fun with her, and I just happened to be in a bad mood. I even asked her if we could go to Great America sometime this summer. I don't know. I feel so bad. I'm sorry diane. I'm really truly sorry. It wasn't you, it was my bad mood and I'm sorry I took it out on you. That's what I'm going to tell her. I think that she'll understand. I think she knows what it's like to have a bad few days. I hope she does at least.",
    "Ohhh great, now Diane thinks I'm mad at her because of Pizza Hut and whatnot... :( It wasn't that I didn't have fun at Pizza Hut, it's that I was just in such a bad mood beforehand...that, I just didn't even really let myself have a good time. Oh well. I'll call her later and apologize. I didn't mean to bring my bad mood down on her, and I really did appreciate that she invited me. That was probably the one good thing about that day.

    "Sorry for not writing sooner, it's been a busy weekend. I discovered I have 20 tests on Tuesday thanks to my teachers. I had marching practice yesterday, played the second part, and it went well. Then I left early for dinner with friends to celebrate Kelly's birthday. We had a sleepover with fun activities and I slept early for a sleepover since I had a Bar Mitzvah this morning. I'm working on a school project where I need to visit a Jewish synagogue and considering a mosque. I need to go now, but will write more later.",
    "Today was satisfactory, despite a delayed start. Preferring brevity in my reflections, I anticipate ending up writing considerably more. It is common for me to fall into this pattern when I express hesitance in doing so. Nothing of note occurred during my classes today, though I engaged with a select few individuals, notably including a person referred to as \"You know who,\" with whom you are unfamiliar. Despite the limited engagement, reaching the summit of the rock climbing wall was a personal accomplishment. I am looking forward to conquering the entire structure alongside my companion, Kelly. Jazz provided its usual enjoyable experience. I wish everyone a pleasant evening as I prepare to retire for the night. Surprisingly, my musings are less extensive than usual. Farewell, and best wishes to all. *Ya di Amore*",
    "Sure! Here is the text restated with a different tone: \"I fully support individuals of short stature and similar groups. I don't have any issues with them, but is it not more respectful to avoid saying 'Up with midgets?' ~With love and understanding~\"",
    "It is now later in the day and my parents have given me a task to do, which they consider constructive - cleaning. It can be frustrating how parents always come up with these tasks. I was enjoying some peaceful time with no homework, listening to jazz, when suddenly I was summoned to clean. Reluctantly, I agreed, though I rarely follow through. However, my mom's gentle and persuasive tone made me feel guilty, so I begrudgingly went downstairs, gathered the cleaning supplies, and tackled the bathroom. Cleaning is not something I enjoy at all. I daydreamed about being a gold digger, marrying a wealthy man who could afford a cleaning lady and a personal chef to prepare peanut butter sandwiches for me all the time. This way, I could lead a carefree life until I gain weight and inevitably face a divorce, potentially walking away with a fair share of the assets due to no prenuptial agreement. Of course, I would need to transform into a charming individual to capture the heart of a rich man or anyone at all. Since my plan is now out in the open, I suppose I will need a new strategy. Despite having nothing much to say and not being in the mood to socialize, I find solace in writing. I long to visit the park, my favorite place in the world, where I can bring my mini disc player, swing, and ponder life's mysteries all at once. The park offers a peaceful sanctuary to be alone with your thoughts, except when curious children approach, startled to see an older kid on the swings. They watch from a distance, perplexed, as I swing for an hour or so. Kids have a way of bringing joy and laughter. Apologies for rambling; I will share more thoughts at a later time.  ~Ya di amore~",
    "This is just a space for me to vent about my supposedly dreadful life in my sheltered town. Sarcasm doesn't quite translate online- I often find myself questioning why I even bother using it. It usually either comes across as mean-spirited or is mistaken as genuine. Today surprisingly went well for a Monday. I managed to get a good night's sleep, completed my homework, and although I sadly had to take the bus to school, I was at least able to enjoy sitting alone with my trumpet. Alone time is precious to me, albeit interrupted by my instrument. At school, I greeted everyone like usual. Brandon seemed a bit better today, although his story about breaking ceramics was not for the faint-hearted. Carson visited me to investigate the alleged new mitten policy; she did not take the news lightly as she often wears mittens in school. I met with various friends, including cute Jake, a member of the Speech Team, and others. Running late to Wind Ensemble due to a delayed bell, chaos ensued in my trumpet section. Our planned sectionals were replaced with a scolding from A. I struggled through my music theory composition but felt relieved when it was finished. Mrs. Kane discussed our poor Lit Analysis papers; while I avoided an F, a D seems inevitable. Gym class involved rock climbing, which I found immensely enjoyable and hope to do more of. The second half of my day was uneventful, with no homework to occupy my time. Skipping combo class was a relief, as I loathe solo performances. The evening concluded with eating and reflecting on a seemingly unproductive day. As I jot down this account while contemplating the eventfulness of my days, I am unsure if there will be anything noteworthy in the near future. For now, I am signing off. ~Ya di amore~",

    "I'm briefly back before my lesson. Just looking to pass the time. Found a penny! How was your day? I talk to my locker. Parentheses bug me. Steve called about chem. I dislike chemistry. Had humanities evening. No homework and free time. Love jazz but nice to relax. My writing is random. High ropes with Peter. Warm up for trumpet lesson. Fun writing random stuff. Fantastic people if you're still here!",
    "I haven't written in a long time but I've been busy with Disney and catching up on make-up work. Disney was a blast - even the bus ride turned out to be fun!

Our jazz band gig didn't go as planned, but it happens. Now off to the mall.",
    "Just finished a delicious dinner and feeling so happy for no particular reason! Chatting with friends, doing homework, and watching Law & Order - multitasking expert over here! Had a pretty good day - no band or music theory, but great company and discussions about winter. Hung out with friends, felt a bit left out, but found solace in a practice room. Wish people read my story fully instead of judging too quickly. Feeling anxious about an upcoming final exam, thanks to my overachiever brother's warnings. Endured a painful gym session - note to self: always wear pants for Commando Crawl! Math was predictably boring. Lunch with friends was enjoyable. End of the day routine at home. And now, the mysterious end to the day...shhh!",
    "I received many compliments on my new haircut! I had it cut and layered last night, and I must say, I am loving the shorter look. Now, I'm on the hunt for new furniture to revamp my room, although I'll keep the wood floor - it's so much easier to clean, especially with my tendency to spill things. \n\nCurrently, I'm eagerly waiting for dinner to be ready so I can focus on studying for my Science test. Even though I dread studying for Science, the thought of a late arrival tomorrow is keeping my spirits up. I was relieved to learn about the late arrival day, thanks to Bryan's reminder.\n\nHowever, despite my procrastination, I've managed to do well in my finals so far. I realize the importance of studying this time, especially with finals approaching next week. For me, it's not the tests that pose a problem but rather the homework. Hopefully, with some dedication, I can improve this habit. Excited for dinner, I'll share more updates later!",
    "Today was eventful! Despite avoiding homework once again, I had a great day filled with various experiences. I painted my nails, which allowed me to type without any smudges. I also had exciting encounters with someone I fancy, who noticed and spoke to me multiple times. School was enjoyable as I spent time with my best friends, observing their interactions. I felt a tinge of jealousy towards a couple among them, pondering my own desire for a relationship. The dilemma of finding a Winter date lingers, but for now, going with a friend seems like a good plan. Despite some tensions over my decision to potentially drop my music theory class, I am focused on doing what is best for me. The day progressed with various activities, including facing fears on the high ropes course in gym class. While dealing with some typical classroom challenges, I found moments of enjoyment and learning. Overall, it was a day filled with emotions and experiences. Now, off to get my hair cut!",
    "I recently completed my paper, and my mom is now reviewing it. It's nerve-wracking! It seems like I've forgotten how to write in a normal way after being influenced by Mrs. Kane's Journalistic style. I can't shake off the feeling that everything needs to be so objective now. It's frustrating! Despite my annoyance, I had a lovely weekend. I've been feeling much better, and I indulged in reading three good books. I also watched \"Pretty Woman,\" which was adorable, although it didn't inspire me to seek love in the way the movie depicts. I came across a quote today that resonated with me: \"Be who you are and say what you feel, for those who mind don't matter and those who matter don't mind\" - Dr. Seuss. This quote is both powerful and true. Now, I need to finish my chat with Bryan and then head off to bed. Ah, sleep, you are so wonderful! Good night!",
    "Currently taking a break from homework to chat with Brandon. Feeling quite apprehensive about the upcoming jazz competition despite not having any solos in the songs, except for Jumpin' at the Westside. Expecting to be really anxious during that part. On a side note, I've been dealing with illness for almost a week now, starting with a cold and then an ear infection. Frustrated with being unwell. Nonetheless, I'll return later to share more after completing my paper. Determined to finish it. Just a little love...*",
    "RAR! OK, sorry, just love typing that! :) Well...just writing my music theory final...heh...last minute...rock on! Woo hoo! I had jazz today, I'm umm...doing better, I guess. When he pointed to me, I didn't like...bury my head and say, \"no, no, no! You can't make me!\" Oh well, s'all good. Umm, no finals today really. Lunch...went in at the end...then band (hardest final EVER) and then finally Comparative Religion...which, we didn't have a final in! yay! The rest of my day has been blah, so I'll write more later...maybe...if anything interesting happens. It wont though! :)",
    "I decided not to go. Conversing with Chris about my concerns was incredibly beneficial. I have great admiration for him. He is an excellent listener when you're feeling upset and need someone to confide in. Initially, I was reluctant to share with him, but he encouraged me and I'm grateful for it. It was a relief to express my feelings. I shed tears for the first time in a while, possibly since my Grandma's funeral, which was one of the reasons I was feeling down. I deeply miss her. I feel the need to express my emotions more often, as the pain intensifies when it builds up and I end up feeling overwhelmed. I long for someone to appreciate me for who I am. In general, I desire to be liked by someone. I struggle to comprehend what makes me unlikeable. Although I may not be conventionally attractive, I believe there are others who are worse off, and I strive to be a good person. It feels disheartening when my efforts go unappreciated. Nevertheless, I will feel better in the morning. Writing and confiding in trusted individuals has a positive impact on me, even if no one reads my thoughts here. It's time for bed. Goodnight.",
    "Once again, I'm upset about winter. Despite recognizing that I have it better than most people on this planet, I can't help feeling selfish for complaining. I should have asked someone and it's a real bummer that I didn't. Everyone seems to have a date for this event, which is disappointing. Gotta go now, bye!",
    "Tonight's entry will be brief as I'm quite tired and in need of sleep. Today was relatively ordinary, with a late arrival which was nice. Unfortunately, Mr. Alstadt will be absent for the next two days, so I'll miss our music theory sessions. Apart from being called down to Mrs. Plumbers due to a mix-up, nothing much happened until jazz class where I felt frustrated by some classmates. I believe Steve should be the section leader since he truly cares about making music sound good. After jazz class, I had my lesson and returned home. It may not be an exciting update, but I felt compelled to share. On a somber note, my beloved great uncle Al passed away recently. He was a remarkable person, and I kindly ask for prayers for his wife and immediate family. Thank you all, and have a pleasant evening. XOXO",
    "I really miss Heather. She was the one person I could confide in about anything. I miss her so much. :(",
    "Today was better than yesterday. Got my schedule changed and sorted things out with Kathryn. Feeling lonely and missing my friends. Want a boyfriend to listen to me. Realized I wanted to go to Winter with someone I like. Feeling a bit better now. Listening to Dave Matthews. Gotta go, people are messaging me.",
    "The Buccaneers emerged victorious. Despite not typically being a fervent football enthusiast, a surprising contrast to my football-loving family and my participation in the marching band, I find myself somewhat taken aback. Alas, a minor conundrum looms; the prospect of attending Winter has arisen, fulfilling a long-standing desire of mine, yet leaving Kelly somewhat isolated. Contemplations have led to the suggestion of accompanying Neil, with whom we are all acquainted, in an effort to include her. The thought of extending invitations to Kristen, Alex, Taylor, and her boyfriend is enticing, yet reservations regarding Kathryn and Joanne's reaction persist. The impending return to school tomorrow feels remarkably close, perhaps obscured by the recent Super Bowl events. It might be prudent to cease writing now, preventing unintended disclosures and prompting a fresh outlook. Our recent achievements remain a source of astonishment, savored in winning fifth place, albeit in a competition of merely five bands – a hasty detail omitted. On reflection, our recent performance was a remarkable feat, though the sudden reference to \"rocking the kazba\" eludes me. An oddity worth pondering; it seems that a penchant for eccentricity is not lost on me. As I find myself conversing with my own thoughts, the time for slumber beckons. Wishing all a peaceful night's rest filled with pleasant dreams.",
    "While everyone else is engrossed in watching the Superbowl, I find myself reflecting on my upcoming trip to Winter. Initially, I had some reservations about it, pondering if going with just a friend was truly what I desired. Deep down, I long to explore this adventure with someone I have stronger feelings for, someone who truly captivates my heart.\n\nNevertheless, despite these ponderings, the anticipation of the trip is beginning to stir excitement within me. Conversing with friends like Joanne and Kristen, who share in my enthusiasm, adds to my growing anticipation. I believe that the experience will be truly enjoyable, especially in the company of friends whom I cherish.\n\nAs I think about the wintery journey ahead, I appreciate the moments of solitude that allow me to reflect and recharge. Even though I adore being surrounded by others, I treasure my personal time as well. While the winter cold may deter some, I envision myself going for a refreshing walk or bike ride, relishing the chance to enjoy the chill in the air.\n\nSo, as I engage in meaningful conversations with friends and relish this break away from the Superbowl frenzy, I find myself embracing the excitement that Winter promises. Despite my initial hesitations, I am now eagerly looking forward to the trip and the shared moments with cherished companions. More updates to come, as I relish these moments of connection outside the realm of Superbowl Sunday!",
    "Wow, what a whirlwind of emotions! Witnessing the class AA bands was a thrill, but it's so surprising that JSO didn't clinch any awards - they're truly phenomenal. As Alex aptly put it, the competition must have been fierce with some exceptionally talented bands in the mix. \n\nMoving on to the Jazz Band, landing in 3rd place may not seem like a big deal among only three bands, but hey, it's still cause for celebration! Despite JSO's unexpected outcome, it's all part of the journey. \n\nReflecting on my performance, my soli went decently well - there's always room for improvement, like playing louder and nailing the timing perfectly. Overall, I feel pretty good about it. \n\nOn a different note, the situation between Andy and Diane is a bit of a puzzle, but seeing Diane happy makes me happy too. Sometimes, that's all we need to know. \n\nWith no homework in sight, it's time to enjoy some well-deserved fun! Ah, the sweet freedom. Maybe I'll come back later to jot down more thoughts. 😊",

While grappling with feelings of sorrow and helplessness, I am torn between an overwhelming impulse to shed tears or to seek solace in solitude.\n\nThe intensity of my emotional response further prompts reflection on the nature of my attachments to individuals within my social sphere. I find myself questioning the fairness of fate, particularly for individuals as talented and compassionate as Zach and Richa. The profound sense of anguish upon contemplating their predicaments reinforces the desire to express my sentiments to cherished acquaintances. Nevertheless, I encounter a personal struggle in articulating these sentiments due to inherent difficulty in expressing emotions. This internal conflict evokes profound sadness within me, spurring a longing for the safety and simplicity of earlier, more innocent times in my past.\n\nAs I grapple with the desire to provide assistance amidst feelings of helplessness, I acknowledge the limitations of my capabilities in the face of such adversity. While prayer offers a source of solace, I am compelled to seek tangible ways to contribute positively to the situation. The internal conflict persists, necessitating a moment of solitude to clear my mind. In this moment of contemplation, personal reflections on my daily experiences seem trivial in comparison to the gravity of the current circumstances. My fervent hope lies in the well-being and recovery of those affected by these recent events.",
    "Why do unfortunate events happen to good people? I wish the saying \"Good things happen to good people\" always held true, but that's not always the case. Two exceptional individuals were in a car accident tonight and, thankfully, they are in stable condition, but it's still a terrible ordeal. They are outstanding individuals who did not deserve this misfortune. I hope they recover swiftly, and I will keep them in my thoughts and prayers. They both make significant contributions to our school and will continue to positively impact the world beyond high school. It's difficult to accept that bad things can happen to good, even great, individuals. \n\nThis situation also makes me appreciate the blessings in my life - a loving family, financial stability, a safe home, food to eat, friends to rely on, and just being alive. It's unfortunate that it sometimes takes tragedies like Kari's passing or Richa and Zach's accident to remind me of this. I often get upset with others whom I perceive as selfish, not realizing that I may be guilty of the same at times. As a friend recently reminded me, \"These are the moments you need to have faith.\" I do have faith. While I pray every night, sometimes it's more of a routine than a heartfelt connection. I will genuinely think about Richa and Zach in my prayers, and I hope others will take the time to do the same.",
    "I find myself unable to resist the allure of the keyboard, my fingers dancing swiftly across the keys, each with a mind of its own. Yet, it is only my two index fingers orchestrating this typing symphony. Surprisingly, I sail through the keys at a rapid pace, almost like a music note in a lalalalalala melody. Laughter flows freely as I immerse myself in this typing distraction, momentarily shielding my mind from the upcoming audition. Engaging in conversation with Brett and Matthew brings joy, although I carefully sidestep the mention of the looming audition. Deep in thought, I muse about personal values, reflecting on the trade-offs between reputation and relationships. An amusing discussion on matters close to the heart persists, eliciting laughter and camaraderie. With that, my thoughts wander once again into the intriguing realm of the unknown.",

    "I'm feeling good because I achieved the 5th chair in the band before Dan did. It was hilarious when Peter teased Dan by saying, \"She beat you.\" Making my way to the band behind Dan was quite an achievement. However, even though I'm happy about it, I'm still in a bit of a bad mood. I want to be my old carefree self and stop pretending to be someone else by taking on aspects of other people's personalities. I had a conversation with someone about this recently, and he mentioned he's doing the same thing. I realize now that I need to embrace my own unique personality and be more outgoing and fun. Being trustworthy is also important, but I know it will take some time to work on that. I'm feeling confused about a lot of things right now, and I don't even care much about the upcoming audition anymore. I'm going through some emotional ups and downs even though everything is going well. I'm trying to stay positive and not let my mood affect me too much. Maybe the gloomy weather is contributing to my feelings today. I'm heading out to go shopping with my mom at Oakbrook, but I'm not as excited as I usually am. Nevertheless, I hope to have a good time. I might write more later since today feels like a day for expressing my thoughts. Take care!",
    "I don't feel bad about what I said. Jim misunderstood and thought I was talking about Dave K. today, but I wasn't. I actually thought Dave K. was upset with me. School was okay. Mr. A said I'm fine, so I'm not worried. Jazz class was good today; I played without holding back! My day was boring, so there's not much to say. I don't feel like typing now or later. You know who I am, and if you don't, you're not cool... XOXO",
    "I'm excited to share that I successfully auditioned for Wind Ensemble, although my happiness is slightly dampened. Unfortunately, the results haven't been posted as expected today, which is quite frustrating. Initially promised for Monday, they've now postponed the announcement to tomorrow. Despite this delay, I need to move on with my day. Just wanted to express my current dismay over the delayed results!",
    "Marvelous! I must say, I had a sudden impulse to express my admiration. Today has been more pleasant as I have dedicated less time to contemplating the audition and other matters. The results will be released tomorrow afternoon, which adds an element of suspense. While the anticipation is somewhat frustrating, I am eager to learn the outcome, whether it be positive or negative. Nonetheless, I embrace who I am and appreciate the journey.",
    "I was very excited last night, and you probably know why because I talked about it non-stop. I can't wait for Monday to arrive soon! It feels like time is moving so slowly, even though it's the weekend when time is supposed to fly by. I took a break from writing to go read a book called Tangerine, which I've read a couple of times before but still enjoy. I might not do much else today since my mom is leaving soon for a business trip. I think I'll spend the day reading more.",

I was pleasantly surprised as I wasn't expecting to have fun, and I didn't even want to go initially. I ended up dancing throughout JSO's performance and had a great time. Anyway, I don't have much more to say now, so I think I'm going to go. I might write more later. Goodnight to all!\"",

Over the weekend, I mostly relaxed but I also took the time to thoroughly clean my room, including washing the floor and organizing everything. Although my room looks great now, it feels strange because everything is now neatly in place. I found out that I did not have a prior commitment according to Brandon. I had tentative plans with Kathryn for today but ended up going to lunch instead. I hope she is not upset about it. Despite not liking the taste of coffee, I enjoy its aroma. I am aware that I am rambling, but I am finding it hard to focus on doing my homework.",
    "I think I made Diane upset by asking her questions about being vegetarian today. I didn't intend to upset her; I was simply curious as I've never known a vegetarian before. I hope I didn't upset her, and I hope she's not just having a bad day. I genuinely hope she's having a great day, but she appears to be upset, and I'm worried it was because of me.",
    "At times, I truly wish individuals would refrain from perusing this, yet at other times, I desire the opposite. People genuinely comprehend..or witness what I express using this medium; however, that may not always be favorable. Interesting, I am in conversation with Andrew. Ha, he regards me as an eerie youngster. It's quite amusing. Nevertheless, I believe I might be approached for a jazz performance, but I am utterly clueless. Oh dear. Well, they cannot fault me for being uninformed about it! Gosh! So, earlier today, I dined with Diane and Joanne. It was an enjoyable experience. Yet, I feel a tad guilty because Diane and I were discussing band matters, and Joanne is not acquainted with them. Whenever I am in the company of band members, I notice such occurrences, and I genuinely do not intend to exclude anyone, as it leaves a sense of isolation. Remembering those times was delightful. I somewhat miss my freshman year, but not too much. I also appreciate my sophomore year. It's intriguing. Well, time for me to go. Honestly, if I hadn't been somewhat unconventional years back, I possibly would be now... hugs and kisses.",

    "Here is the revised content: While contemplating, I realized how Harry Potter would benefit from an invisibility cloak to move freely around Hogwarts during the night. Ironically, despite my distinctive white hair, I often feel invisible to most people. I frequently find myself feeling like I am not a top priority, sometimes even feeling like I am overlooked by some. However, amidst these experiences, there are exceptions like my friends Kelly and Emily. Their unwavering support and consideration make me feel valued and cherished in their lives. It's a relief to have them by my side. On the other hand, there are those who consistently make me feel inadequate, treating me as an afterthought rather than a priority. Dealing with these situations can be challenging, and while I attempt to brush it off, it still affects me. Despite these encounters, life moves forward. Just a fleeting thought. XOXO.",
    "I'm feeling more upset than I expected about my brother leaving. I'm really going to miss him. The thought of having limited time left with my family before I go off to college and start my own life makes me sad. Spending time with my family brings me joy and helps me escape the shallow behavior of high school. It's hard to say goodbye. 😞",
    "Sure, here is the refined version of the text you provided:\n\nI've decided to keep typing until my mom calls or gets home because there's nothing else to do. My family and I are going out to dinner tonight as it's my brother's last night here before he leaves for Australia tomorrow. I'm going to miss him a lot because he's always been there for me and we've gotten closer in the last few months. It's surprising how much I'll miss him. At least I'll have the bathroom to myself, but I'd rather have my brother here.\n\nMoving on from the sad stuff, my day was a bit gloomy because of my speech. It didn't go well, and I don't want to talk or write about it anymore as it's painful to think about. On a lighter note, I wore a skirt today. I have mixed feelings about skirts; I like them but also don't. Anyway, my mom just called saying she's on her way home from the airport, which makes me happy. So, I'm off to do something exciting! Goodbye!",

He's always freaking out about consistency in rehearsals, but guess what? He just cancelled for the next two weeks. Talk about unfair! I'm so frustrated, but whatever. I usually write in my online diary, but it's locked right now. Ugh, so annoying. I guess I'll try again later. 🙁",
    "Sure! Here is a revised version of the text: The gig last night really brought down my self-esteem. It was a disaster. But tonight's gig went well and was actually kind of fun. Kelly drove me, and on the way home, we had a great time stopping at McDonald's. We had some food, listened to the Now and Then soundtrack, sang loudly, and even danced. It was so much fun! I really appreciate both Kelly S. and Kelly C. They both rock my world. I might stop writing here... maybe?",
    "Today was like any other day, but let me share some highlights with you. I had a fun moment when I wore my black hoodie with the hood up and caught everyone off guard because they didn't recognize me without seeing my hair. People kept saying I looked stoned, which was pretty hilarious. On another note, there's some drama going on at school as the juniors might have to retake the ACT due to stolen answer booklets. It's a chaotic situation, especially after the whole school assembly about it. \n\nMath group work is my ultimate nightmare - it's just so frustrating! On a brighter note, I had a stroke of luck with my government packet today and scored a fantastic 33 out of 35. I can't go into details, but it was a pleasant surprise that I'm grateful for.\n\nI think it's time for me to retreat to my private diary, as typing in this public space can be a bit much sometimes. Maybe I'll stick to one diary from now on because managing two entries is a task for a lazy person like me.",
    "Alright, so, I'm feeling quite indecisive. I determined to keep on jotting down my thoughts in this space, at least for the time being. Today I opted to scribble here instead of in my regular journal. Who knows why? My mind has its own mysterious ways. School was just average today, nothing extraordinary. I caught up with many of my friends and had a nice chat with Emily during lunch. I suspect Dave may have seen that particular entry here, as he's been noticeably kinder to me in recent days, especially since Jazz Cafe. Perhaps he has reverted to his previous self. I truly hope so. I miss the old Dave - he was a unique guy compared to most. Ugh, guys can be frustrating sometimes. Anyway, last weekend was pretty uneventful. The highlight was hanging out with Chris, Jim, and Alex. We had a blast. Haha, we even had dinner at Alex's mom's place, and it was delicious. Later, we watched Swimfan and The Matrix at Chris's place, and I was amazed by The Matrix; it's such a fantastic movie. I'm not usually into that genre, but this one really hooked me. I have to head off soon. We have a performance at Ellsworth Elementary. I'm excited and wondering if we'll get to watch the kids perform. That'd be so amazing and would definitely boost my confidence. Well, gotta go for now. Oh, before I go, I heard this rather harsh saying the other day that I found oddly amusing, but...it was quite mean. I felt bad for laughing, you know? It went like this, \"I'm outta here like the fat kid in dodgeball.\" Pretty cruel, isn't it? I can't believe I chuckled at that. I feel terrible! Anyway, time for me to sign off. I probably won't be back to write more tonight due to the pile of homework waiting for me. Goodnight, lovely princes and princesses! :)",

Looking forward to summer, it can't come soon enough! Oh well, we went to Chili's, which was quite interesting since I haven't been there in ages. I indulged in a big dessert that was delicious, but definitely too much. Thinking of going for a run tomorrow. That's all I have to share for now, as I can't fit everything in this journal.

Let's drown out the noises coming from our neighbors, my love, as our charming little tub overflowed. The days of rap and dub are over, now our surroundings are filled with steam that almost conceals your beautiful presence in this intimate tub of love. I shall tenderly wash over you, as you reciprocate the gesture for me. Why don't you adjust your leg slightly, and I shall do the same? Together, we shall become impeccably clean, our love radiating brightly. I am gleaming with delight, and you shine just as brightly in our love-filled tub, where life feels anew, and our connection seems almost flawless.\nI read those words sans any innuendo, as they provoke deep contemplation within me. While they could potentially carry a suggestive meaning, that interpretation does not resonate with me. It is a moment of contentment knowing there is no one currently vying for my attention. I find solace in my lack of romantic interests, avoiding the potential awkwardness and complexities that would arise if I did harbor such feelings for someone.\nAlthough I am sidestepping my science lab responsibilities, I experienced a pang of regret for missing out on a potential outing to Kohl's with Brandon. Nevertheless, I engaged in a phone conversation with Chris, still managing to procrastinate on my lab duties. Lately, I have been engaged in meaningful conversations with Erica, a friendship I deeply cherish. With that said, it is time for me to bid you farewell and focus on my pending homework tasks—a regrettable reality. Goodbye for now.",

It's having that reliable presence, that supportive shoulder, that makes all the difference. The emptiness persists despite the air we breathe, indicating that true solace can only come from meaningful companionship. Let's seek out those who bring genuine comfort, rather than fleeting distractions.",

Thank goodness for that! Already feeling better just from catching up on some sleep. Had marching \"tryouts\" on Wednesday and Thursday, yesterday was just basics. Surprisingly, it wasn't as tough as I expected, thank goodness. I'm actually relieved that I stuck with marching, fulfilling the promise I made to my mom. We watched the senior movie featuring the song \"We Go On,\" from my Freshman year show, always pulls at the heartstrings. \n\nHad the scariest conversation last night with Chris, he suddenly asked, \"What if I told you how I really feel about you?\" Heart pounding, unsure if he was serious or not due to lack of tone in his voice. Panicked, thinking of how to respond politely, considering his rough week. Later, someone suggested I should consider dating Chris when discussing crushes, but the truth is we're just good friends, nothing more. Dating Chris would be too weird and out of the question, no way. No offense to him, it's mutual. Let's set the record straight - Chris and I see each other strictly as good friends. Fed up with people not understanding the dynamics of having male friends without romantic intentions. \n\nHad a chat with Bryan about it, really appreciate how easy it is to talk to him. Grateful for his friendship, but no, I don't have any romantic feelings towards Bryan either. Enough said. Hopefully, that clears things up. Byebye!",

This entry may be difficult for others to comprehend, but it was a necessary step for my own emotional healing.",

My mom passed it on to me, and now I'm battling it while having an eye exam tomorrow. Not ideal with watery eyes everywhere! :( Today was uneventful. I might join the marching band.

Men just don't seem to grasp these cues. I find it impossible to pardon him for his actions toward her. It's disheartening. I surrender. Relationships in high school are quite disappointing.

    "Bruce Almighty was a hilarious movie night with Kathryn at Overweis, but our conversation took a dark turn as we discussed the hurtful reality of feeling unnoticed and unloved. The constant teasing and lack of empathy my peers show me is an exhausting cycle. While some days the attention from being a target is almost bearable, the real pain cuts deep when they mock my poor eyesight. It's frustrating how easily I become a punching bag for others, despite my best efforts to stay kind, honest, and moral. Why do good people like me have to endure such relentless ridicule while those who engage in destructive behaviors are celebrated? The thought of enduring more years of disrespect in this toxic environment fills me with dread. I long for a fresh start away from all this negativity, even though I know leaving will offer little solace as I will likely encounter similar issues elsewhere. It's disheartening to witness the glorification of harmful behaviors and the lack of consequences for those who indulge in them. As I count down the days until summer break, I can't help but fantasize about escaping this cycle of misery and finding a place where respect is earned through genuine kindness and integrity.",
    "Today has been a bit dull. I'm feeling down, longing to spend time with someone special. Despite knowing I shouldn't have feelings for him, it seems like I do. I wish we could hang out outside of school; he seems like a fun guy to be around. Tonight, I plan to watch \"Bruce Almighty\" with Kathryn, which should be enjoyable. Everyone seems occupied, and my weekend feels uneventful. I wish I could see someone who is currently out of reach; it's not helping matters. Yesterday was a good day. School was uneventful, but the highlight was attending One Acts with Kelly, Kathryn, and Joanne. The play was hilarious, and Mary Clare waving to us on stage added to the fun. During intermission, we joined the band crowd and found ourselves acting a bit wild – it was a blast! Now, I'm looking forward to heading to the movies with Kathryn. Bye for now!",

    "Yesterday's events were quite enjoyable. I managed to go through the entire school day without uttering a single word, which presented an intriguing challenge. As a result of this feat, I was rewarded with a sum of $20, which was a pleasant surprise. However, due to the constraints of a bet I had made with someone, I had to communicate the details without directly speaking or writing about it. Eventually, I succeeded in conveying the message to others through a chain of communication. \n\nLater in the day, I encountered a moment of panic when I couldn't locate my concert dress, but my distress was alleviated upon finding it. The concert itself turned out to be enjoyable, surprisingly so, as our performance was satisfactory. The concert band's rendition was quite acceptable, and my friend Kristen and I managed to identify several commendable aspects of their performance. Following the eventful day, I felt relieved to return home and rest peacefully throughout the night.\n\nThe following day proceeded routinely until the marching activities took place. The marching routine, centered around the piece \"Washington Post,\" was executed as per tradition. Subsequently, I was kindly driven home by Brandon. However, a regrettable incident occurred when an ill-considered message I posted inadvertently caused distress to a friend. Upon realizing the unintended impact of my words, I attempted to contact her to resolve the misunderstanding. The incident served as a poignant reminder of the importance of exercising caution in speech and written communication.\n\nFortunately, I was able to connect with my friend online, providing a sense of relief.",
    "I had a rather eventful day with much to share, but I am feeling quite worn out at the moment to do so. I plan to jot down my thoughts tomorrow. The number of \"writes\" and \"rights\" is quite amusing, don't you think? Alright then, I must get some rest now. Goodbye.",

    "Today was a decent day. Band was usual, except we had it in the auditorium, which was uncomfortable due to the warmth from the lights. Thankfully, the music theory teacher did not talk much. In chemistry, we conducted a lab that was uneventful. During health class, we learned about the female reproductive system. A classmate named Kat was quite fearless, asking bold questions and sharing some personal and unnecessary information. Speech class was dull, as we took a quiz and I need to change my persuasive topic due to a lack of sources. Lunch was typical, and math presented a challenging quiz. Government class was enjoyable. Before government, I entered a quiet mood, which made others concerned. Now I'll go prepare my dinner. Goodbye.",
    "Someone wagered that I could not maintain silence for an entire day of school. I am indeed accepting this challenge with certainty. I shall carry it out resolutely. It will be a remarkable feat. The only challenge will be articulating this to others.",
    "I enjoy being silent. It's amusing how others respond when I choose to be quiet. They often inquire, \"Is something the matter?\" or \"Are you okay?\" or even \"What's going on, Catie?\" But truly, there's nothing wrong. I'm content, peaceful, and...simply quiet. Is it not acceptable to embrace silence? Some people seem to think it's a wrongdoing. Oh well, just allow me the peace of quietness. Hehe. Anyway, I'm heading off to have dinner or engage in some productive activity...perhaps?",
    "I will smile as if everything is fine, speak as if all is well, behave as though it's just a dream, and pretend that it's not painful...because one day it will be true and everything will be okay.",

    "Chatting with Christy has been absolutely incredible! I deeply miss her presence. The level of trust I have in her is truly remarkable, surpassing that of anyone else in my life, except my mom.",
    "Absolutely nothing happened! Oh well, stuff like that just happens sometimes, you know? I was really itching to avoid spending Saturday night all by myself. Argh! If only I could drive, that would be fantastic! Having that freedom to escape and go wherever I want without relying on anyone else would be amazing. It would be so wonderful to explore solo and have my own adventures. *Sigh* Can't wait for summer to roll in. I'm craving a trip to Michigan! Feeling the sand between my toes, the soothing waves crashing against my legs—it's what I need. Picture this: me strolling alone on the beach at sunset. Just being in a serene and gorgeous place all on my own. Well, time to dive into a book now. Catch you later!",
    "I updated it once more. This is enjoyable! Wheeee. Yep, I'm definitely having a blast!",
    "I just got my hands on a fantastic new template named \"Aliens Stole My Wallet\"! Its quirky name never fails to bring a smile to my face. I must admit, I find myself easily amused by the little things in life.",
    "Currently, life is going well. Although I have a substantial amount of homework to attend to, overall things are favorable. I am considering plans to socialize later, which brings about a sense of excitement and satisfaction as it ensures my Saturday night will not be spent in solitude.",

    "I am confident in my own company and enjoy spending a relaxing Friday night at home without any regrets.",
    "If I were a crayon, I'd be brown. The brown crayon is often overlooked and underappreciated, despite being used frequently for drawing trees and brown hair. Its usefulness is underestimated. The brown crayon deserves more respect for its reliability and assistance, even if it isn't as visually appealing as other colors.",
    "This week has been quite smooth so far, with the days seeming to pass quickly, which is a relief. However, I anticipate that next week will feel agonizingly slow in comparison. At the moment, I don't have much motivation to write, but I might come back to it later. I need to prepare my dinner now, so I'll be leaving for that.",
    "I can't help but reminisce about Victoria. She was more than just a pet - she was my faithful companion. The way she would always come running when I called her, the nights spent curled up together, and her uncanny ability to sense when I needed her most - those moments were truly special. Everyone knew that Victoria was mine, and mine alone. She accepted me for who I was, without any judgment or desire to change me. \n\nBut then, tragedy struck. I found her lifeless body on the floor, and the pain of losing such a loyal friend cut deep. The thought of her not being here to comfort me through tears or cuddle with me is hard to bear. It's a wound in my heart that feels like a shard of glass, a constant reminder of what I've lost.\n\nI know that crying won't bring her back, but I can't help but revisit those memories. It's a bittersweet feeling, mourning the loss of someone who loved me unconditionally.",
    "\"Why is it so hard for me to connect with people? Matt's the only one who seems to get me. It's like I'm invisible to everyone else. It's baffling, really. I try to be a good person, but am I just fooling myself? Maybe I've been living in a fantasy world all this time. Will I ever find love? It seems like everyone else has, and I'm left here listening to their stories, feeling disconnected. It's bittersweet to be the confidante, yet never the subject of conversation. Is there anyone out there who sees me for who I am? Right now, the glass isn't just half empty – it's shattered into a million pieces.\"",
    "I am not sure what to do or what I am thinking right now. Life feels very confusing at the moment. If I keep thinking about Michigan, I will feel happy. :)",

    "I can't even imagine what he did to his first girlfriend.",
    "I'm really surprised at how mad I am. I'm extremely angry, even more than words can say. It's bad enough what you did to one person, now you want to hurt another person too? Another issue is that I can't be near her if she's with him. I wouldn't be able to handle it. I would feel like I want to harm something or someone.",
    "AHHHHHHH! You've completely ruined everything, you jerk! Thanks a lot!",
    "I am deeply concerned about the current situation, particularly with regards to the potential harm that may come to the individual involved. Despite the fact that I am aware of troubling information about the individual with whom she is involved, I feel powerless to intervene. It troubles me greatly to witness her potentially making decisions that could jeopardize her well-being. It is troubling to contemplate how this situation may unfold and the lasting impact it could have.\n\nOn a more positive note, I had a delightful conversation with Joanne this evening which was a pleasant diversion. I hold her in high regard and cherish our interactions. However, the weight of the unresolved issue weighs heavily on my mind. I fear for the well-being of the individual and worry that she may suffer emotional and physical harm at the hands of her current partner. Despite my concerns, I anticipate that my apprehensions will unfortunately come to fruition. It saddens me to think that I may ultimately have to witness the consequences of this unfortunate situation.\n\nDespite the belief in second chances, it is distressing to observe the individual repeatedly overlook concerning behavior. The potential for harm is alarming, and my inability to prevent it weighs heavily on my mind. I recognize the necessity of restorative rest to regain perspective on these matters.",
    "I just had an enlightening moment - I wrote \"my kelly's\" as if they belong to me! All mine! A little slip that revealed my possessive delight! How amusing!",

    "I just had an epiphany, guys!! The light bulb is ON! Woo! Picture this: Kelly hits stardom and I'm front row at her concert, feeling like a VIP. I try to sneak backstage, but the security guards stop me, yelling, \"HEY, GET OUTTA HERE, CRAY-CRAY GRANNY!\" And I'm all like, \"But guys, I'm practically besties with Kelly!\" They just chuckle in disbelief. And then, out of the blue, Kelly appears and goes, \"Catie, my darling,\" while I burst into uncontrollable laughter in front of the baffled guards. Haha! It's gonna be a riot! 🌟🎤",
    "As trivial as this song may seem musically, its sentimental value is immeasurable. Let's reminisce on those endless late-night conversations about our future. While we dreamed of where we would be at 25, time and life changes were the last things on our minds. But now, as we stand on the brink of departing, the realization hits us that we won't be returning to this chapter of our lives. Our paths are diverging, and it's time to speak our truths before it's too late.\n\nMoments flash before us like scenes from a silent movie, and I can't shake off that night in June when love caught us off guard. Through laughter and tears, we navigated the uncertainties of life, comforting each other in our fears and doubts. These memories, etched in our hearts, will remain priceless treasures.\n\nSo, as we move forward, unsure of what lies ahead, let's hold onto the bond that binds us together. Despite the changes that await us, our friendship will endure the tests of time. Whether we land the big jobs, chase the big dreams, or simply embrace a new chapter, one thing is certain – we will always have each other.\n\nIn the journey ahead, as we face the unknown, let's carry with us the shared moments, the inside jokes, and the unbreakable bond that we forged. Because no matter where life takes us, we will forever be friends, united by the memories we created together.",
    "I'm feeling melancholic today. It was the seniors' last day, which got me thinking about my own imminent senior year. The thought of leaving my friends and familiarity behind is unsettling. While I have some fantastic friends now, I worry about losing touch with them in the future. Chris, in particular, holds a special place in my heart, and the idea of us drifting apart after he goes to college saddens me. I've learned that close friendships can change over time, like what happened with Christy and Amanda. However, I know that my bond with Kelly is unbreakable, and I trust that we'll remain connected no matter what. The uncertainty of maintaining friendships post-high school is daunting. I cherish the moments spent with my close friends but fear that our paths will diverge. Change is inevitable, but it's difficult for me to come to terms with it. Despite this emotional turmoil, I'm grateful for the blessed life I've had.",

    "How should one proceed when the only individual who holds a favorable opinion of them happens to be the very same person they find most disagreeable? This individual is potentially the sole individual who may come to hold a positive view of me, yet I struggle to reciprocate such sentiments. The irony of the situation is rather palpable.",

    "I've noticed I've been writing more often recently. It's strange, I'm feeling a mix of emotions - happy yet sad at the same time. It's like there's something important within reach that I can't grasp. I can't quite put my finger on it...",
    "Time is an illusion, never truly passing; Leaving means taking a part of your youth with you. Lives transform, never to return to what they were; Change may bring numbness. Trust in the potential for life to shift, to break free from stagnation; We are altered, distinct from before. Uncertainty lingers, yet feeling a flicker of rightness. Hold yourself to the light, amid fading embers; In the city of your birthplace, the fire still burns. Have faith in the immediacy of the present. Despite doubts, confident that change is possible; We'll condemn insincerity, make amends, experience it all. Tonight holds indescribable moments, making the impossible possible. Trust in me now as I trust in you, this bright night.",

I can't even handle a conversation right now without saying something I'll regret. Despite having great friends, I'm still feeling low and lonely. And though I crave solitude, I also miss my friends, especially Amanda and Heather. I wish today and tomorrow would just be over. I had a bizarre dream recently, and I'm still trying to make sense of it. I just need to get through this speech and then unwind with a good book and some rest. What is going on with me? Can someone please help me figure it out?",
    "I have a strong desire to retreat to my own space where I can find solitude and embrace my true self. In this sanctuary, I seek joy, laughter, and the freedom to imagine possibilities that may seem unattainable. These dreams, whether rooted in reality or fantasy, serve as a source of comfort and solace, allowing me to prioritize my own well-being and identity above all else.",
    "I'm feeling a little off right now, the mode where everything seems a bit annoying. I've decided to disconnect, steer clear of interactions, and focus on perfecting my speech. Nope, there's no chance of me engaging in conversations tonight. It feels risky. These moods always throw me off balance. It's likely due to feeling not so great. Alright, time to put my energy into finalizing that speech.",
    "Yes! Finally! After struggling with technical issues, I was beyond frustrated. I feel terribly sick, my stomach throbs with pain. So unfair, while others have it easy. Today was alright, just 4 days left of classes. Attended Wind Ensemble, made progress on my speech outline at the writing center, surprisingly productive. Music theory class is a nightmare, can't wait to escape. Endless chatter, ugh! Chemistry was confusing, Mr. K's notes were a mess. Health class was dull, pointless tasks. Speech class spared me from giving my speech, but Plastic Surgery talk was unsettling. Math class was boring, yet I grasped the concepts. Endured Government class watching 12 Angry Men. A mundane day, looking forward to finishing my speech, having dinner, reading, and an early bedtime. Byebye.",
    "Good morning! I'm really hoping today goes well and that I won't have to give my speech or see Mr. A. You know, something just occurred to me... If Alstadt were to somehow read this, it'd be a disaster! I'd never get into WE again, or I'd feel terrible, or both. Yikes! Maybe I should stop writing about Alstadt here. I know I probably won't because he frustrates me a lot, but I'll try to mention him less. Okay, off to school now. Yay? Bye bye!",

Regrettably, I refrained from contacting *boy* as I lacked the necessary fortitude to initiate such correspondence. Though, to be candid, initiating contact was not truly my intention. The unsurmountable barrier remains firmly in place! I did, however, engage in a pleasant conversation with an amiable acquaintance over the telephone, rendering the overall experience of my Sunday evening reasonably satisfactory.",
    "Hmm, you know, it's funny. I just realized how little I talk about my dad. I was chatting with someone on the phone earlier, and they asked about my dad as if he's disappeared or something. It's amusing. My dad is pretty awesome, and we get along really well. Actually, I get along with my whole family; they're great. While I don't share personal stuff with my dad like I do with my mom, we still have good conversations. Anyway, I should quickly do some research for my final speech and then head to bed, so tired! Bye!",

    "I've made a decision. It's funny how spending just an hour and a half with my girlfriends can bring so much clarity. So, that's what I did tonight. I visited Kathryn's house where we hung out and had a lot of fun. I really enjoy spending time with them. Kelly wasn't there, but that didn't dampen the fun. Later, I got to drive, which was exciting! Anyway, I'm feeling a bit tired now, so I'm heading to bed soon, hopefully without being interrupted by an instant message. I have quite the addiction to AIM. Well, that's life!",

I ended up reaching for the cleaning spray and well, let's just say the ant didn't stand a chance. Now I feel a mix of guilt and relief, but bugs really give me the heebie-jeebies, especially those with more than four legs. Just the thought of centipedes makes me shiver!\n\nBut enough about bugs - I have more exciting plans ahead! I'm heading over to Kathryn's place tonight, and I couldn't be more thrilled about it. Time to wrap up here, grab some dinner, and get ready for a fun evening ahead. I'm feeling pretty content right now. 🙂",
    "I am so thrilled to head to Michigan, for reasons unknown to me. Chatting with Lauren last night got me all hyped up about partying and having a blast. I have this strong desire to let loose and enjoy myself, even though I made a vow to steer clear of alcohol and such. Silly promises, really. I find myself yearning to join in on the fun. I had the chance to tag along with Pat, his buddies, and my brother a while back, but I declined because I knew they would be indulging in alcohol and drugs. Conor, however, doesn't partake, so I might hang out with him while the others do. I even joked with Max about bringing a non-drinking and unattractive guy named Sara, but he said that was impossible due to the Sara part. A funny conversation snippet with Lauren has found its way into my narration. We are brewing up some mischievous schemes to get back at the guys this year. We are also planning to prank some unsuspecting folks. It promises to be quite the spectacle. Alas, duty calls—I must pretend to tidy up. More updates to follow later.",

There's no need for verbal responses; all I ask is that you perceive my sentiment. The time feels right for us to break down the barriers separating us.\n\nAm I still alive, or has that vital spark deserted me? Do you see me so transparently, as though I'm made of glass? You're the only one who truly grasps the essence of who I am. I refrain from asking questions that remain unanswerable for now.\n\nEven in chaotic times when everything seems to be crumbling, I'll ascertain your stance and my own path. I don't require your words; I need you to empathize with me. Let's dissolve these artificial restrictions completely.\n\nHow far have we progressed, and do we now risk discarding our shared history? Will you patiently await my return? I wonder about our status, but voicing these thoughts today may only hasten their demise. I'll remain here, awaiting our reunion.\n\nWill we ever experience such intense elation once more? Not today. Will that sense of authenticity ever return? Not today. Can I reclaim your heart? Not today. Will we ever relive that authenticity? Not today.\n\nThe world can be frustrating, and people can be disappointing.",

    "Haha, guess what? I found out someone else reads this! Eek, I really need to watch what I say. But hey, this is like my personal diary, and I don't spill any deep secrets here anyway. Lucky for me, I can talk about Ryan all I want because he never checks this. \n\nI'm feeling a bit anxious about tomorrow. Originally, Ryan and I planned to spend the day at Great America, but then I changed my mind because lots of people I know will be there. I didn't feel like being surrounded by familiar faces all day. So, we thought about going bowling or catching a movie instead, but now I'm second-guessing that decision. I'm worried that if I see him, my feelings might resurface...and I really don't want that. Our past relationship just didn't work out for a reason, and I don't want to go through that heartache again. It took a lot of effort to rebuild our friendship after we broke up. On the other hand, maybe I'm not being a good friend by avoiding him. I know if we do meet up, we might end up back together by the end of the day. I've thought about it, but part of me just craves being in a relationship with someone. Oh well... \n\nOn a brighter note, tonight was enjoyable. I went to Peter's party, which was...okay, I guess. I didn't really know many people there, and my friends Chris and Brandon were busy playing video games. Luckily, Kelly and Annie were there too. It's nice having them around. Eventually, I left the party early and hung out with Chris for a bit, which was fun. \n\nThat's pretty much all that happened. I'm just feeling nervous about what's in store for me tomorrow. I feel like I wasn't fully present when Chris was sharing with me earlier. Sigh. Whatever is meant to happen, will happen. I guess I'll just have to wait and see.",
    "Exciting day! I slept in before my lunch final and arrived late for my government final. Surprisingly, I scored a high 97% without studying. After the exam, Kelly, Joanne, John, Kathryn, Mary Clare, and I lunched at Einsteins after failed attempts at two other restaurants. We even went paddle boating which was so enjoyable and a bit chilly. Starbucks was next, where I opted for a fruit drink. Then, we went to Joanne's and had fun with karaoke and a dangerous game of \"spoons\" using forks. Despite getting a minor cut, Joanne's Elmo band-aid made it better. Perhaps we unintentionally upset Kathryn, but she kept it to herself. Later, I'll attend Peter's party with Chris driving me. Tomorrow, I plan to spend the day with Ryan. No Great America visit as many are going. Looking forward to the fun ahead!",

    "Today was a rollercoaster of emotions from start to finish! Despite my initial dread, the day turned out to be absolutely fantastic. My nemesis, Alstadt, tried to rain on my parade with his grumpy attitude, but I refused to let him spoil my mood. The day kicked off unexpectedly when I found the band room open before school - talk about a pleasant surprise! Skipping school norms, I aced my speech final with ease, securing a solid B without any prior study. A walk in the park! \n\nLater on, my friend Kelly and I decided to rebel against the mundane routine and embarked on a Burger King adventure. Our excursion for some delicious food and playful toys turned out to be the highlight of the day. Subverting authority never felt so exhilarating! Back in school, even music theory class couldn't dampen my spirits. I even managed to prove Mr. Alstadt wrong with my music composition skills - a sweet victory indeed! The day wrapped up with a quirky scratch and sniff toy from our kids' meals, including one that smelled unbelievably dreadful - a hilarious discovery.\n\nReflecting on the day's escapades, I can't help but feel a rush of excitement and positivity for what's to come. Who knows what mischievous adventures await tomorrow? Time to seize the moment and find something fun and productive to do next!",
    "Hey, so today was a bit of a downer. Woke up late, searched high and low for my shoes, found them eventually. Then, disaster - discovered a rip in my dress! Luckily, mom came to the rescue and fixed it in a jiffy. Managed to get to my event on time, which was held outside, leaving me soaked from head to toe. Afterward, got a surprise ride home, changed, and went to Chipotle for the first time with friends. The food was delicious, but I couldn't finish it all. Then, off to Coldstone for some chocolate ice cream with gummy bears. Yum! Ended the day with a chat and drive with Chris, then home to unsuccessfully attempt to study math. Instead, decided to write. Funny how a friend's honesty can make you appreciate them more. Feeling pretty trustworthy right now. Off to pretend to study now. Catch you later!",
    "Tonight feels like a never-ending cycle of pain and heartache. It's as if my heart is being torn apart repeatedly, each time just as agonizing as the last. The wounds never seem to fully heal before being ripped open again. The hurt is overwhelming.",

    "I'm feeling pretty down at the moment. I went out to Pizza Hut with my friends tonight, but it wasn't as enjoyable as I had hoped. I'm in a bad mood and finding it hard to have fun. It feels like I'm wasting my summer. I'm not sure why, but I'm just really upset and sad right now. Hopefully tomorrow will be a better day. :(",
    "I can't believe everyone jetted off to Germany, leaving me behind! But hey, it's all good because I've been living it up in the meantime! Still keeping up with Chris and Kelly, but also soaking in quality time with my local squad. I even managed to hit the pool yesterday without frying to a crisp - well, except for that one rogue patch on my face that avoided the sunscreen! Hanging out at Kathryn's with Joanne and Kathryn was a blast; it felt a bit surreal being with both of them, but in a good way. And let's not forget the sleepover at Joanne's last night - got surprisingly good sleep despite the uncomfortable floor situation. Watching \"The Princess Bride\" for the first time was an absolute delight! Joanne’s hilarious quest for information she didn’t have was the icing on the cake. Now, after a busy day of cleaning, I’m gearing up for an exciting evening out with Katharine, Diane, and maybe even Steve and Jeff. Fingers crossed for a night full of fun and adventure! Well, time to tackle my to-do list - it's calling my name!",

    "My day was filled with heartfelt moments and bittersweet farewells as I showered my daddy with gifts. Amidst the nostalgia, I found solace in the captivating world of Civilization, a game that held me spellbound. However, the looming departure of loved ones left a void that I fear will be difficult to fill. As I bid adieu to friends, a tinge of melancholy lingers in my heart, knowing how much I'll miss them. Amid all this reflection, I managed to tackle the mundane task of cleaning my bathroom, a chore I abhor. Dreaming of a future where such burdens are lifted, I wished for wealth or perhaps a partner who revels in tidying up. Though the latter may seem like wishful thinking, my cherished conversations with Kelly and Chris serve as a beacon of connection amidst impending separation. ",
    "I find it quite interesting how my feelings towards him seem to diminish with each passing day. While it may not be humorous, it is rather disheartening. Interactions with him consistently evoke feelings of anger and frustration within me. Certain individuals have a remarkable ability to incite annoyance within me.",
    "While reviewing my very first blog post not found on this page, I had the thought, \"wow Catie, you were such a dork.\" That entry actually terrifies me. I wonder if in seven months, I'll feel the same as I did about my initial post on November 14th. It surprises me that I have been consistent in writing here. I have never maintained a proper diary as I always felt that I was simply complaining to paper. Even though this feels similar, just whining at a computer screen, I have managed to continue. I ponder how much longer I will persist. I have no plans to cease writing anytime soon. Interesting reflections. Right now, I'm not in a very contemplative mood, so I believe I'll go read and await a good storm! 🙂",
    "Wow, today's weather is so interesting! It keeps changing from rain to sun to clouds. I'm curious if there'll be storms all day. I actually enjoy storms, as long as they're not too intense. Reading during storms is my favorite - all cozy with my blanket and stuffed animals, listening to the rain and thunder. It's such a fun way to spend time, though I admit it's a bit unconventional!\n\nI can't believe my family is coming home on Monday. I'm really excited, but time has flown by so fast during their absence. I've had such a great time hanging out with friends, meeting new people, and having a blast. Only 13 days until Michigan, and I found out we might be going to Italy for Thanksgiving this year. I'm beyond excited - Italy is one of my favorite places in the world! And if my mom gets the bonus she's working towards, we might even fly first class. How amazing would that be?! I could actually get some sleep on an overseas flight. I'm so thrilled and can't wait for the trip.\n\nI'm a bit worried that I might miss the marching band at the Macy's Day event if we go to Italy, but I absolutely love Rome. Hmm, my house feels too quiet right now. I'm going to check it out - silence always makes me a little nervous.",
    "I had a conversation with someone tonight who asked me if I cry often. It was amusing because I rarely shed tears except for when something truly matters to me, or when I suppress my emotions, or when I listen to a beautiful song that stirs my feelings. Music has this unique ability to evoke unknown emotions within me, leaving me in awe. While I have no desire to pursue music professionally, I am grateful that it enriches my life, and I deeply admire those who create exceptional music. Well, it's time for me to go to bed now... really...",
    "I'm having such a hard time typing tonight. My fingers are being clumsy and I keep having to type every word twice. Frustrating!",
    "Yada yada yada! I'm wide awake and, for once, not in the mood to cozy up with a book. It's puzzling how I'm not feeling tired right now. Maybe it's because I woke up at a decent time today. Hmm, I should quit rambling in this journal and go hang out with my friends. I was chatting with like... 5 pals, and all the talks wrapped up simultaneously. Bummer. Haha. Katharine just suggested I hit the hay. Yeah, I probably should. Will I? Probably not, sadly. I really should heed my friend's advice. They offer solid wisdom. Especially on sleep. I heard Chris, Mike, and both Daves were having a drink in Germany. It's kind of surprising. Not upsetting... more like disappointing. I'm taken aback. I recall chatting with one of the Daves about drinking before, and when I asked if he ever imbibed, his reply was a firm \"NO!\" I still remember it vividly because he seemed almost offended by the question at the time. Like, \"How dare you ask me that? Of course, I don't indulge, you silly girl.\" Oh well, I suppose it's their call, not mine. They can do as they please, but I admit, my opinion of Dave has dropped a tad. Anyways, I'm off to mingle with some cool folks because... well, because they're cool. Wheee. I reckon I'll hit the hay with a smile on my face tonight. :) And hey, I finished my book, which is lovely. Need to find a new one now. Ah... I'm out...",
    "I am contemplating whether or not to proceed with this. Most likely not. I am feeling hesitant and cautious, similar to a conservative individual. I always found the tale of the chicken that survived for around 15 hours after losing its head intriguing. Although I disapprove of the act of decapitating the chicken, I cannot help but find the survival instinct displayed by the creature fascinating. It would be intriguing to examine the scientific explanation behind this phenomenon.",
    "Here is a revised version of the content to make it unique:\n\nYou know, I've had a realization lately. I used to worry about people finding it strange that I go to the park, swing on the swings, and listen to my music when I need to clear my mind. However, I've come to accept that everyone has their own unique place for contemplation, and for me, it's the park. I find solace in this simple act, although I can't quite pinpoint why. The peaceful surroundings help me declutter my thoughts as I tend to overthink things. It's not that I lack privacy at home – my family respects that. Yet, the park is my sanctuary, and I've grown fond of it despite any odd glances from others.",
    "I would give up all eternity to hold you in my arms Feeling your presence, you're my closest taste of heaven right now I have no desire to leave this moment behind Every breath I take is filled with your essence As time slips away, I can't bear the thought of missing you tonight  I want to keep our connection hidden from the world They may never comprehend our bond When everything seems fragile and uncertain, I want you to truly know me You can't suppress the tears or escape the harsh truths Everything seems surreal, as if in a movie scene We bleed just to feel alive I don't want the world to witness our intimacy It's impossible for them to grasp our unique connection When everything appears unstable and shattered, I want you to see my true self I just want you to understand the real me I simply want you to know who I am...",
    "Rephrased content: \"Standing on a ledge, contemplating a fall or jump, you could achieve everything with patience. I want to be with you forever, but timing is crucial. Don't postpone resolutions for later; seize the present. I promise not to disappoint you, even if I'm not what you expected. The future is uncertain, and we adapt as we go. Let's avoid empty promises and live in the present moment.\"",
    "I was bombarded with an invitation from Kelly and Kathryn and Joanne and Mary Clare and...why did I feel the need to list them all out? Regardless, they asked me to join them for the screening of the sequel to Charlies Angels, but honestly, it doesn't align with my taste. The first movie didn't leave much of an impression on me either. Thus, I made the choice not to spend my hard-earned money on something that doesn't truly captivate me. Embracing a solitary evening at home sounds perfectly fine. Ah, the joy...",
    "You, with the sad eyes, don't lose hope. I understand how difficult it can be to find strength in a world with so many people, where it's easy to feel small and consumed by darkness.",
    "I hate how I freak out over someone being upset with me. I just want Kelly or Chris to come home so I can talk to them without waiting for an email reply. Hurry up, Monday! 😔 #frustrated",
    "Today, I'm spending time with my family and doing some chores like cleaning my room before I can receive my new furniture. My mom is skilled at motivating me with rewards. Time to get going!",
    "I am truly grateful for my exceptionally good life, although at times I feel overwhelmed by my luck and worry that it might not last. I am choosing to be thankful for what I have and hope for it to continue. On a lighter note, I sometimes feel silly at night and wonder if it's related to late-night brain activity. Also, gummy bears taste delicious at 2:22 in the morning.",
    "Ah, the night is young and I find myself wide awake. No worries though, it's all part of the adventure! Plans may change, but the excitement remains. Looks like our movie night with Joanne is just around the corner on July 9th; can't wait for the fun ahead! Oh, and speaking of fun, I'm chatting with someone pretty interesting right now. That's all I'll share for now—it's all about keeping the mystery alive! Time to continue these lively conversations and indulge in some reading; who needs sleep when there's so much to enjoy?",
    "I am currently not choosing either option. This situation feels familiar to where I began. It's frustrating that even my computer seems against me. I treated myself to a delicious grilled cheese earlier, and tonight I plan to enjoy chicken parmigiana. I'm unsure of the correct spelling but that doesn't bother me. I might as well spend my time elsewhere rather than on my blog.",
    "I was scheduled to visit Joanne, but she had to decline due to her pressing obligations to organize her mother's closet. This change in plans is tolerable for me as I am not feeling well. It has been one of those days where I lack motivation. I am contemplating making myself a grilled cheese sandwich and indulging in some leisure activities such as reading or watching television. The thought of grilled cheese invokes a sense of addiction within me. I recognize the importance of establishing a structured sleep routine, although I anticipate deviating from it while in Michigan. Consequently, adhering to a strict bedtime of 9 o'clock seems impractical for me. My current state of mind is peculiar and unconventional; a recent incident involving my ponytail accessory being flung across the room serves as an example of my quirky behavior.\n\nWhile there is little of substance to report at present, I have encountered information that may be beneficial in the future. Despite my uncertainties, I am inclined to wait until college to make firm decisions. I anticipate the college experience with much excitement, envisioning the possibility of encountering more mature individuals. I remain hopeful that Joanne and her significant other can sustain their relationship despite the upcoming year-long separation. Their bond appears resilient, and I believe they possess the qualities necessary to withstand the challenges ahead. I am genuinely pleased for their happiness.\n\nNow, I shall proceed to prepare my grilled cheese sandwich and engage in a session of reading. It has come to my attention that I have inadvertently neglected to sign this note regularly; however, I trust this omission shall not pose any significant repercussions.",
    "I've realized something. It seems that guys do not like girls like me. They prefer girls who are mysterious, funny, interesting, or even those who seem innocent. Hmm... I don't really want to change myself, but it still frustrates me. Only 16 days left... just 16 days. I am looking forward to getting away from Naperville. It will be a pleasant break. I am excited to go on the jet skis, try tubing, and simply relax in the hammock and read. :) So peaceful. *Sigh* ARGH! July 11th, why won't you come sooner??? Oh well, that's life. Hehe. Anyway, heading off to sleep. Good night.",
    "I am pleased to announce that this matter has finally been resolved. I shall briefly recount the events of my evening, as I am eager to retire early in preparation for my appointment at Joanne's tomorrow at 1:00. The night transpired adequately. Originally, I had plans to go out with Erica, Brett, and an acquaintance named Roger, yet the outing did not come to fruition, resulting in my visit to Joanne's instead. As fate would have it, we watched the first Harry Potter movie, and to my chagrin, Kathryn inadvertently divulged a significant detail from the fifth book. Regrettably, it seemed intentional on her part, causing mild discontent for Kelly and me. Nonetheless, the evening proceeded without significant issue. I am pleased to report that the situation with Diane has been amicably resolved, bringing me great joy as the recent tension had created a sense of unease. Lately, I have observed a general air of vexation and impatience amongst those around me, prompting the thought that perhaps a temporary separation is needed for all to regroup. It is indeed a peculiar phenomenon. My thoughts naturally turn to my mother in such moments, yearning for her counsel regarding a pressing decision I am contemplating. Despite my longing for someone to confide in, I find myself cautious in selecting confidants, as trust is a precious commodity. The process of deliberating is arduous; perhaps compiling a list detailing the merits of each option may serve to clarify matters, although intuition suggests the answer should lie within my heart. Uncertainty prevails, and only time will reveal the outcome. Exhaustion looms, and I acknowledge that rest is imperative, having transitioned from a lighthearted to a more earnest conversation. I immensely enjoy moments of levity when I can embrace silliness without concern for external judgment. With this, I am inclined to bid you farewell and retire shortly, perhaps indulging in a few pages of my current read before succumbing to sleep. Not featuring Harry Potter this time. Farewell, until next time! 😊",
    "How frustrating! I put in so much effort writing a piece, only for it not to be published due to issues with the platform.",
    "I am feeling uncertain and conflicted at the moment as I struggle to make a decision. I find myself leaning towards one option after talking to someone, only to feel swayed towards another option after speaking with someone else. This back-and-forth is frustrating for me as I generally find decision-making challenging.",
    "I can't wait to be reunited with my cat! I miss her so much. I wish she could be here with me now. I can picture her right by my side, listening to me pour my heart out.",
    "I went out with my mom today and had fun searching for furniture. Found a set I like, but it doesn't have the bed I want. Thinking of getting the set and painting an unfinished bed to match. Planning to go out again soon in comfy pants. Can't believe it's only been 12 days of summer, feels longer. Excited for my Michigan trip to see friends and read Harry Potter. Blogger acting up, but it will post eventually.",
    "Sure, here is a rephrased version of the text: \"I sincerely hope she can forgive me. I enjoyed spending time with her, but unfortunately, I was in a bad mood at the time. I even suggested we visit Great America this summer. I feel remorseful and want to apologize to Diane. It was my bad mood's fault, not hers, and I regret taking it out on her. I plan to explain this to her, hoping she understands since she may have experienced tough days too.\"",
    "Diane probably thinks I'm upset with her over the Pizza Hut incident, but it's not about that. I wasn't in the best mood beforehand, so I didn't allow myself to enjoy the outing. I will apologize to her later because I didn't mean to dampen her spirits. I truly appreciated her invitation, which was the one good thing about that day.",
    "Diane may think I'm upset with her because of what happened at Pizza Hut. It's not that I didn't enjoy being there; I was actually feeling down before we met up, which affected my mood. I will call her later to apologize. I didn't mean to dampen the fun or bring my negative energy into our time together. I truly valued her invitation, as it was one positive thing that stood out that day. I hope she can forgive me once we talk about it.",

    "\"That's ironic because I'm usually not very trusting with people. These quizzes are enjoyable! I believe I'll do some more.\"",
    "You embody naivete - innocent, trusting, and sometimes shy because you're unsure of how to act. You give off a vibe of needing protection. Remember, not everyone is good, so being overly trusting can leave you vulnerable to hurt.",
