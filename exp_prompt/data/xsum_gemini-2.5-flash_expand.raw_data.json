        "Maj Richard Scott, 40, is accused of driving at speeds of up to 95mph (153km/h) in bad weather before the smash on a B-road in Wiltshire. Gareth Hicks, 24, suffered fatal injuries when the van he was asleep in was hit by Mr Scott's Audi A6. Maj Scott denies a charge of causing death by careless driving. Prosecutor Charles Gabb alleged the defendant, from Green Lane in Shepperton, Surrey, had crossed the carriageway of the 60mph-limit B390 in Shrewton near Amesbury. The weather was \"awful\" and there was strong wind and rain, he told jurors. He said Mr Scott's car was described as \"twitching\" and \"may have been aquaplaning\" before striking the first vehicle; a BMW driven by Craig Reed. Mr Scott's Audi then returned to his side of the road but crossed the carriageway again before colliding head-on with a Ford Transit van in which Mr Hicks was a passenger, the court was told. \"There is no doubt that when the Audi smashed into the panel van he was on completely the wrong side of the road,\" Mr Gabb said. Mr Hicks, from Bath in Somerset, was asleep in the van being driven to a construction site in Salisbury by fellow DR Groundworks colleague, Patrick Gilleece. The jury was told the Maj Scott suffered \"substantial injuries\" and could not recall the crash, which happened shortly after 07:00 GMT on 6 October, 2014. He does not accept the charge and suggests it was in fact Mr Reed who had crossed the carriageway, causing the collision, Mr Gabb told the court. The trial continues.",
        "The ban was backed by local authorities in Urumqi, state media reported. The move is the latest in a campaign against Islamic clothing and symbols in the mainly Muslim region. China's government has blamed Uighur militants for several recent attacks - but activists say the violence has been fuelled by Chinese repression. The Uighurs traditionally practice a moderate form of Islam. Recently, though, the influence of stricter forms of the faith from the Gulf and Pakistan has led to more women covering their faces. According to the BBC's Asia Pacific editor, Charles Scanlon, the Chinese authorities regard wearing an Islamic face veil as an act of defiance at a time of growing violence in the region. In August this year, the northern city of Karamay banned men with long beards from boarding buses. Some experts believe such restrictions could backfire at a time when many Uighurs believe their culture is under attack. James Leibold, an expert on China's ethnic policy at Melbourne's La Trobe University, told Reuters news agency that the ban on the veils would make them \"more popular as a symbol of resistance and assertion of ethno-national identity\". He is quoted as saying that China's Communist party had made a direct link between certain Islamic dress styles and religious extremism. The law passed in Urumqi is set to come into force after it has been approved by a regional body. China's authorities have attributed a wave of recent violence, some of which has targeted civilians in public places, to Uighur militants inspired or aided by overseas terror groups. It has launched a crackdown in the region, arresting and jailing scores of people. But Uighur activists say that China's strong-arm tactics in Xinjiang - including cultural and religious repression - are fuelling tensions. Why is there tension between China and the Uighurs?",
        "Palmer expects to be fined by the British Horseracing Authority (BHA) for the rule breach during Champions Day. \"It was an oversight,\" Palmer told BBC Sport. \"The wrong kit box was left in the lorry and taken to the stables.\" The Newmarket-based trainer saw Galilieo Gold finish fifth in the Group One Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot. Horses are only allowed to receive hay-feed or water before a race, but other substances such as electrolytes are permitted post-race. Employees of Palmer and fellow trainers, Francois Rohaut and and Jean-Claude Rouget, as well as the trainers themselves, were interviewed by stewards following a report by the Equine Welfare and Integrity Officer. Palmer is yet to hear what punishment the BHA will hand down. \"I imagine there will be a routine fine for a rule that's been broken,\" he told BBC Radio Berkshire. \"There's no suggestion that anyone was trying to seek an advantage or cheat. It's simply what the rule says. The rules are the rules and you need to stick to them.\" BHA media spokesman Robin Mounsey said: \"Of the substances, three are electrolytes which are permitted in the stables but they just failed to clear it beforehand, while the other substance is permitted in training but just not on a race day.\" All the horses involved, Signs Of Blessing, Architecture, Galileo Gold, and Almanzor - winner of the Champion Stakes - were routine tested. Meanwhile, Palmer has confirmed Galileo Gold will race on next season and the four-year-old will stay in training. \"Horses like him are incredibly hard to find,\" he added. \"When you find them, you want to try and keep them.\" Subscribe to the BBC Sport newsletter to get our pick of news, features and video sent to your inbox.",
        "Regina Hungerford, 56, denied striking a 17-year-old as he listened to music in her class at Merthyr Tydfil College. But a disciplinary panel ruled contact with the pupil was probably made and her conduct had been \"unacceptable\". On Thursday, the Education Workforce Council imposed the suspension, saying: \"The public interest is in favour of her being able to teach again.\" Mrs Hungerford admitted shouting and slamming a book on the desk of the \"provocative and disruptive\" teenager as he listened to rap music in her classroom - but always denied hitting his head. She was cleared, on appeal, of a criminal charge for assaulting the pupil during a maths lesson for those with learning difficulties. But in November, a disciplinary panel found, on the balance of probabilities, she had made physical conduct with the pupil on the head or hand. The panel found she had \"acted in an inappropriate way\" and ruled it was professional misconduct. During the hearing, the mother-of-three pleaded to save her \"very rewarding\" career. She told how the allegations had \"ruined her life\", calling it a \"miscarriage of justice\", but said she wanted to continue teaching. On Thursday, Mrs Hungerford was told she would be suspended from the teaching register for four months, but she will be allowed to return after taking a behaviour-management course. Panel chairman Gareth Roberts said it was the appropriate sanction to \"allow her to return to teaching within a short period of time\". He said: \"The public interest is in favour of her being able to teach again.\"",
        "She was speaking at an event on Thursday to remember four men who were shot dead by the SAS in her home village of Clonoe in 1992. DUP leader Arlene Foster said Mrs O'Neill was wrong to attend, but was not surprised. However, Mrs O'Neill has defended her decision to speak at the event. She said:\"There are some who would say we have no right to remember or to honour them, we have absolutely every right. \"Everyone, it doesn't matter who you are, has the right to remember their dead in a respectful and dignified manner.\" The four IRA men were shot dead after attacking Coalisland police station. Soldiers opened fire on them as they dumped a lorry used in the machine-gun attack in February 1992. The Ulster Unionist Party's Mid Ulster candidate, Sandra Overend, has criticised Mrs O'Neill for attending the event. \"It is only to be expected that republicans would wish to remember their dead, but Michelle O'Neill's presence at such an event is hardly sending a signal to the unionist community that she is some kind of new departure for Sinn Fein,\" she said. An Alliance Party spokesperson said: \"While people will naturally want to mark those who died during the Troubles, it is important in doing so, the focus is on healing wounds, reconciliation and not glamorising violence. We need to avoid using the past as a political weapon, instead focusing on healing and reconciliation.\" SDLP justice spokesperson Alex Attwood said: \"The fundamental roadblock to justice, truth and accountability is the fact that some want to address the past on their own terms and not the terms required by victims and survivors. \"That is what is getting in the way and one of the big reasons why legacy is not being dealt with",
        "Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) said the force had \"fragile\" staffing levels and needed to \"implement improvement plans rapidly\". Inspectors visited the force after criticising its response to government spending cuts last year. Police and Crime Commissioner Olly Martins said the report was \"out of date\". In the HMIC's Policing in Austerity: Meeting the Challenge report last year, Bedfordshire Police was judged to be \"requiring improvement\". Inspectors, who said the force would be \"monitored closely\", returned in October and found it was not performing well compared to similar forces. It highlighted problems in the force control room, although said these should be improved by a recent increase in staff. The report described staffing levels as \"fragile but improving\" and said although there had been recruitment, it was not clear what investment the force had made in preventive work to reduce demand. \"There is a concern that it may not be tackling longer-term issues,\" the report said. Inspectors said it needed to implement its plans for improving policing in \"an affordable way more quickly\" while ensuring its service \"remains effective\". However, they said the force was \"moving in the right direction and the pace of change is increasing\". Mr Martins said: \"All that publishing out-of-date snapshots of a force, such as today's report does, is potentially undermine police force morale and mislead the public. \"When HMIC have already made their subsequent inspection it frankly seems incompetent, to say the least, to still publish a report that's seven months out of date.\" HMIC said it had made a further assessment in March and would be",
        "Their first stop on a busy day of public engagements was a tour of the Giant's Causeway in County Antrim. The Unesco World Heritage Site is made up of some 40,000 large black basalt columns which protrude from the sea. It was the Royal couple's first visit to Northern Ireland's best known tourist attraction. The causeway formed when molten rock was forced up through fissures in the earth to form a lava plateau. The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh then travelled to the nearby village of Bushmills to commemorate local soldier Robert Quigg. He won a Victoria Cross for bravery during the Battle of the Somme. Sgt Quigg was given the highest military award for valour after going out into the line of fire to search for his commanding officer. The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh unveiled a statue of the soldier as well as a commemorative stone. His grandnephew, Leonard Quigg, also gave a short address. From there, the Royal couple moved on to a reception at Portrush Golf Club as guests of the mayor for the Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council. Afterwards, they took a journey back in time as they travelled on a steam train from Coleraine, County Londonderry, to the village of Bellarena. Large crowds gathered in Coleraine to greet the couple as they boarded the five-carriage train, built in 1932. The Royal guests were accompanied by local schoolchildren as they travelled to Bellarena, where the Queen officially opened the village's new train station. The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh first made the same journey along the historic Coleraine to Londonderry railway line in 1953 - the year of her coronation. The original station had opened a century earlier in 1853. Earlier this year, two new railway platforms opened in Bellarena, as part of a \u00c2\u00a346m upgrade to the Coleraine to Londonderry railway line. On her arrival in the village, the Queen unveiled a plaque marking the new development. Wellwishers lined the route, waving union flags and cheering. On Monday, the Royal visitor met Northern Ireland's first and deputy first ministers at Hillsborough Castle in County Down. The trip is the third high-profile royal visit to Northern Ireland in weeks and follows on from appearances by the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall and then the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh last visited Northern Ireland in June 2014.",
        "The Institute of Public Policy Research (IPPR) said London's poorest children outperformed those in the north. The report is being launched by the centre-left think tank in Sheffield. The government said extra funds were being given to early years providers to help children from poorer backgrounds and close the attainment gap. The report has also detailed a number of \"tests\" or benchmarks for the government's northern powerhouse scheme. Research by the IPPR showed only 47% of children born in the poorest families in the north of England achieved a good level of early years development compared with 59% in London. Its survey also found five northern city-regions combined had almost as many well-qualified individuals (3.6 million) as London (3.7 million) - but the IPPR forecasts demand for skilled workers in the North is set to increase. The IPPR has proposed 11 benchmarks for Chancellor George Osborne's flagship policy to boost regional economies, including closing the \"stark\" gap in the development of children aged under five. IPPR's director Ed Cox said: \"We will never become a powerhouse economy when our children and young people have such a poor start in life. \"It will take a generation of investment - not only in new railways and motorways, but in the 'human capital' of the north - in education and training, starting with the youngest. \"If the Northern Powerhouse is to be successful, economic powers must be devolved to all corners of the North to allow businesses and policymakers to develop an economy that supports more productive, resilient and sustainable growth: jobs that pay well, prosperity that is shared, and opportunities for all.\" The Department for Education said it was committed to ensuring every child, regardless of background, could fulfil their potential. It said reforms had meant there were 250,000 more pupils in good or outstanding schools in the north since 2010.",

He doesn't want to be treated like that,\" Mallinder said. \"All George wants to do is get back and play rugby.\" The Wales international previously had a six-month spell out of the game after suffering a series of blows to the head during matches, including a serious concussion when scoring a try against Wasps in March 2015. Media playback is not supported on this device The former Scarlets winger will sit out Northampton's game against Sale Sharks on Boxing Day because of the incident, despite saying he was not knocked out. \"He said he can remember going up in the air, he remembers landing on the floor, he remembers his head striking the floor and he said he wasn't unconscious,\" Mallinder told BBC Look East. \"That's not saying that he was not knocked unconscious briefly. If he thought he had been concussed, then George is sensible enough to put his hand up and say 'I'm concussed and I need some time out of the game'. \"He went to see the specialist on Tuesday, who backed up that he hasn't got any symptoms. But because he may have been knocked unconscious, we must treat it as a concussive episode and therefore we will not play him for a couple of weeks.\" A concussion review group was formed to investigate how North's case was handled and whether the club have a case to answer, but Mallinder is not worried. \"I want it [the report] to be favourable towards the medics and the rugby club, because I know that they haven't intentionally done anything wrong,\" he continued. \"I hope it's honest and accurate.\"",
        "Seamer Abbott, 29, and top-order batsman Rossouw, 27, confirmed their international retirements in January. Rossouw, in his first season in county cricket, refused to say if his hand had been forced by Cricket South Africa. \"Maybe, maybe not,\" he told BBC Sport. \"I think that story is one I'm going to tell at a different time.\" Kolpak contracts allow sportsmen from countries with associate trade agreements with the European Union to be afforded the same right to free movement as EU citizens. They are not classed as overseas players under the terms of their contracts, but they become ineligible to represent their country at international level. Abbott and Rossouw's decisions came before Britain's exit from the European Union and they are among several South Africans to make the switch ahead of the new domestic season. Among the others, all-rounder Simon Harmer has joined Essex,Stiaan van Zyl and David Wiese have moved to Sussex and fast bowler Hardus Viljoen will line up for Derbyshire. \"Right now, I'm just going to enjoy life here in England,\" Rossouw said, as he prepares to start a three-year contract with Hampshire. \"I'm enthusiastic about the season. I'm 100% clean cut on my decision and I don't think that's going to change any time soon. \"Right now, my home is in England and I want to be here beyond the next three years for Hampshire.\" For Abbott, a four-year deal marks a return to the county he last played for as an overseas signing in 2014. \"I made a lot of friends here during my last spell and it just felt like the right place for me,\" the right-arm pace bowler said. Abbott broke down in tears when he announced his international retirement after helping South Africa to a home series win against Sri Lanka, but said at Hampshire's pre-season media day that he had come to terms with his reasons for doing so long before it was confirmed. \"I've been comfortable for a long time to be honest,\" he added. \"I've always felt like Hampshire was a home for me. It was a pretty easy transition across here.\" Abbott and Rossouw will hope to make immediate impressions for Hampshire when they begin their County Championship Division One campaign against Yorkshire on 7 April.",
        "Stephen Parnaby, Conservative leader of East Riding of Yorkshire Council, said the announcement was \"great news for the town and the wider East Riding\". The authority said it was spending about \u00a3100,000 on hosting the event. The organisers of last year's inaugural race said it brought \u00a350m into the region's economy. The three-day event was launched by tourist body Welcome to Yorkshire after the county hosted the Tour de France Grand Depart in 2014. More than 1.2m people lined the 320-mile (515km) route. Mr Parnaby said last year's event had attracted thousands of spectators to the East Riding. \"The council feels that the investment made by the authority, circa \u00a3100,000, to bring part of the race here is money well spent and will provide opportunities for local traders to capitalise on increased spending and help boost the East Riding economy,\" he said. Others in Beverley have also welcomed the race's arrival. Local amateur cyclist Ed Neilson said he hoped having the start of the race would encourage other cyclists to visit the town. \"It's nice to see Beverley getting some recognition,\" he said. \"I think that a few people felt it missed out a little last year, because it wasn't shown on the telly.\" Garry Payne, who owns a cycling cafe, said it was \"fantastic news\" for fans that they would get a chance to get up close to the riders. He said: \"It's so colourful and the riders will be signing autographs, and they're a lot more accessible than what it was last year when they literally whizzed by in the flash of an eye.\"",
        "The doctors' union had refused to sit down and talk about improving patient care and had spread \"misinformation\", he told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. Mr Hunt wants to change junior doctors' contracts, which he says are \"unfair\". The BMA said its door was open to talks and blamed the strikes on Mr Hunt's \"shambolic mishandling\" of the matter. The dispute, which began in 2014 and centres around pay and weekend working, has led to strikes being held across England. The next is a 24-hour strike planned for Wednesday, when emergency care will only be provided from 08:00 GMT. Asking by Marr about low morale among junior doctors, Mr Hunt said: \"One of the reasons for that anger is that they were told by the BMA that their pay was going to be cut - it isn't. \"They were told that they were going to be asked to work longer hours - they aren't,\" he added. \"We are actually bringing down the hours that they work. And if you are told by your union that the health secretary wants to do these awful things - of course you are going to feel devalued.\" BMA junior doctor committee chairman Dr Johann Malawana said Mr Hunt was threatening to impose a contract that junior doctors had \"roundly rejected\". \"Junior doctors already work around the clock, seven days a week, and they do so under their existing contract,\" he said. \"If the government want more seven-day services then, quite simply, they need more doctors, nurses and diagnostic staff, and the extra investment needed to deliver it.\" He went on to say the health secretary risked \"alienating a generation of junior doctors and undermining the delivery of future patient care\". Shadow health secretary Heidi Alexander said Mr Hunt was \"insulting the intelligence\" of junior doctors. \"This is a group of people who are incredibly intelligent, are able to make their own minds up, have read the proposals for themselves and have followed the negotiations very carefully,\" she told Sky News. The junior doctors row explained What exactly do junior doctors do? How does your job compare?",

As the South Korean company scrambles to contain the crisis, we look back at the developments so far: 2 August: Samsung unveils its latest flagship model Galaxy Note 7 amid great fanfare in New York. The phone is packed with new features like an iris scanner. The initial response is good and expectations high. It's seen as Samsung's big rival to the upcoming iPhone 7. 19 August: Sales start in 10 markets, including South Korea and the United States. European markets are scheduled for October. 24 August: The first report of a Note 7 device \"exploding\" appear in the news. It isn't long before there are more incidents with users posting pictures and videos of what they say are their phones overheating, exploding or catching fire. 2 September: Samsung announces a voluntary global recall of some 2.5 million Note 7 phones, citing faulty batteries. The company offers to either refund or replace the device. 8 September: US federal aviation administration and numerous airlines worldwide tell passengers not to turn on or charge the Note 7 while on a plane. 9 September: The US Consumer Product Safety Commission urges people to stop using the phone and on 15 September, issues a formal recall. Meanwhile, Samsung announced it will resume selling the Note 7 on 28 September in South Korea 19 September: Reports appear of phones in China catching fire as well although Samsung said the batteries for the devices sold in China were from a different supplier and not affected by the recall. 1 October: Samsung resumes sales of the Note 7 in South Korea. In the US, the replacement of phone is in full swing. 6 October: There's the first report of a replacement Note 7 still showing the same problems.

The company also tells people to power down their phones and stop using them.",
        "The removal of the engines, which have lain idle for two years, would leave 142 active vehicles in the capital. Savings from the proposal would be invested in making more staff available to crew Fire Rescue Units. But the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) said it would be \"dangerous and reckless\" to get rid of them permanently. The London Fire Brigade (LFB) has released three plans to make the savings. It insists no stations will close and no firefighters will be forced to leave their jobs. The Brigade said it had continued to meet London-wide attendance time targets while the 13 engines had been out of service. It said that bringing them back would improve response times by about four seconds for the first engine to reach the scene. An alternative proposal has been put forward by London Assembly Member Andrew Dismore, who recommends putting the 13 fire engines back into service but making savings by establishing alternate crewing at stations with some specialist appliances. The proposals will be discussed on 2 December and there will be a full public consultation on how the Brigade will find the savings, LFB said. The FBU said it was \"opposed to the removal of any fire engine from London.\" A spokesman said: \"In wake of the Paris attacks, it would be dangerous and reckless to reduce the number of fire engines and we would urge the London Fire Brigade to think again. \"The ten fire stations that were closed last year increased response times. By removing these fire engines, we fear that response times could increase again.\"",
        "The news agency's account was suspended and it advised all tweets should be ignored until further notice. The false message said: \"Breaking: Two Explosions in the White House and Barack Obama is injured.\" US markets were spooked by the tweet; the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 150 points as it was retweeted. On Tuesday evening, the FBI said it was investigating the incident. White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters soon after the tweet was published that President Obama was fine, and financial markets quickly recovered the lost ground. AP said later: \"The @AP twitter account has been hacked. The tweet about an attack at the White House is false.\" The account was back online on Wednesday. The agency said the attack came after repeated attempts by hackers to steal the passwords of AP journalists, adding that it was working to correct the issue. Spokesman Paul Colford said the wire service had disabled other Twitter accounts following the attack and was working with the microblogging site to investigate the breach. AP reporter Mike Baker tweeted: \"The @AP hack came less than an hour after some of us received an impressively disguised phishing email.\" The phishing email in question appeared to come from the email account of another AP staffer, with a request to click a link to a \"very important\" article on the Washington Post website. The link opened a bogus login page requesting users enter their staff ID and password, reports suggest. A group claiming to support Syrian President Bashar al-Assad took responsibility for the attacks, tweeting: \"Ops! @AP get owned by Syrian Electronic Army! #SEA #Syria #ByeByeObama.\" The Syrian Electronic Army claims to have been behind similar attacks on the twitter feeds of Agence France Presse news agency, Sky News Arabia, al-Jazeera mobile and CBS News. Two of the US broadcaster's accounts were suspended after fake messages appearing on the @60Minutes account criticised US support for \"terrorist\" rebels in Syria. On Tuesday evening, Twitter said it was investigating the incident and reminded users to be \"extra vigilant\" about phishing emails.",

Perth Sheriff Court was told there were three children in the car at the time of the incident. The 46-year-old was ordered to carry out 250 hours of unpaid work and banned from driving for two years. Prosecutor Rebecca Kynaston said motorists heading north near the House of Bruar shopping complex saw McCormack driving straight towards them. She said: \"To their horror they saw the lorry coming south. He was on the wrong side of the road. \"They managed to get off the road onto the verge. \"The lorry missed them, but unfortunately it continued on and a couple with three children in their car weren't so lucky.\" Ms Kynaston said that the lorry hit the offside of the car and scraped along it. She said: \"One might have hoped that would bring this to an end. The impact was forcible and bent the truck onto the wheel. \"Police managed to pull over the lorry further down the A9. This had been going on for quite a few miles.\" McCormack, 46, from Kilmarnock, admitted driving dangerously on the wrong side of the road on 11 April last year. He also admitted failing to stop after an accident, and driving a vehicle which posed a danger due to its condition. Defence solicitor David Holmes said McCormack had decided to stop driving in the wake of the incident. He said: \"He has no recollection of the accident or how it could have taken place. \"He remembers sneezing and that's as far as it goes.\" Sheriff Lindsay Foulis said: \"He has no recollection of what happened but was aware of a sneezing episode prior to the crash. \"Five vehicles had to take avoiding action. \"To go into the other carriageway of the main trunk road north, it doesn't take much imagination to work out what could have happened.\"",
        "In a statement, it said Foreign Affairs Secretary Perfecto Yasay would raise the issue at a major two-day Asia-Europe summit starting on Friday, attended by China's Premier Li Keqiang. A UN-backed tribunal ruled on Tuesday that there was no legal basis to China's claims in the South China Sea. China has vowed to ignore the ruling. It says the panel has no jurisdiction and its activities in the region will not be affected. The Asia-Europe Meeting Summit (Asem) in Ulaanbaatar in Mongolia on Friday and Saturday will be the first major multilateral diplomatic gathering since the 12 July ruling over the South China Sea. The summit will see 53 leaders from Asia and Europe attending, including from countries such as Vietnam and Malaysia which also claim territory in the region. It will also be the first meeting in which the new Philippine government of President Rodrigo Duterte will be represented on the world stage. The Department of Foreign Affairs said Mr Yasay, representing Mr Duterte, would \"discuss within the context of Asem's agenda the Philippines' peaceful and rules-based approach on the South China Sea and the need for parties to respect the recent decision\". It is the strongest statement yet from the Philippines on the ruling. Mr Duterte has adopted a more conciliatory approach than his predecessor Benigno Aquino, saying the Philippines would be willing to share natural resources with China in contested areas if the tribunal ruled in its favour. It initially welcomed the ruling as a \"milestone decision\", but without outright celebration. China, which claims almost all of the South China Sea, has said the summit is \"not a suitable place to discuss\" the issue. \"It should not be put on the agenda,\" Assistant Foreign Minister Kong Xuanyou told Reuters. Tuesday's ruling came from an arbitration tribunal brought by the Philippines under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which both countries have signed. It said China had violated the Philippines' sovereign rights and caused \"severe harm to the coral reef environment\" by building artificial islands. The ruling is binding but the Permanent Court of Arbitration has no powers of enforcement.",
        "\"It's been a massive showcase for so much that's positive, strong and good about Wales,\" he said. Mr Crabb said the relationship with the Welsh government and First Minister Carwyn Jones worked \"remarkably well\". He said they had been determined that day-to-day politics would not interfere with showing Wales working together. More than 60 world leaders, 4,000 delegates and 1,500 journalists have spent two days at the Celtic Manor Resort for the one of the biggest ever international gatherings ever to be held in the UK. Mr Crabb said: \"We wanted it to be an opportunity to show the world the very best of Wales in terms of hospitality, quality of infrastructure and facilities. I believe this week has shown exactly that. \"We've been clear that this Nato summit needs to have a lasting economic impact for Wales. I believe the global profile of Wales this week will help that. \"And with the investment summit we're organising on the back of the Nato summit, we're determined it will bring more inward investment. \"Bringing world leaders, prime ministers and ambassadors here this week has all been part of that plan.\" The UK Investment Summit, on 20 and 21 November, will also be held at the Celtic Manor. US President Barack Obama voiced his approval for the warm Welsh welcome on Thursday, praising the country for its \"extraordinary beauty, wonderful people, and great hospitality.\" Despite hopes of long-term benefits to Wales, traders in the centre of Cardiff have complained that security barriers and road closures hit their businesses hard by deterring customers in the run-up to the summit and during the event. First Minister Carwyn Jones paid tribute to residents and businesses for their support for the summit and \"tolerance of some inevitable disruption\". \"What a fantastic week this has been for Wales,\" he said. \"President Obama himself gave us the biggest endorsement, praising the extraordinary beauty, wonderful people and great hospitality of our country and saying he would encourage people from the United States to visit here. \"The next step is to ensure we keep this momentum going.\" Cardiff council promised that security barriers in the centre of the city would be taken down by Sunday afternoon. As part of the promotional push at the summit, world leaders were presented with willow baskets filled with gifts from Wales. A note from Prime Minister David Cameron said: \"I hope you will enjoy each of these gifts and be inspired by them to find out about all that Wales has to offer.\" The basket included:",

This will happen via an alternative back - known as a MotoMod - that Amazon will sell for the Moto Z later this year. And at the CES tech show in Las Vegas last month, Chinese tech giant Huawei announced it would include Amazon's rival Alexa assistant on its phones. Google Assistant differs from its competitors slightly in that it is designed to prompt conversations with users and respond to follow-up queries. \"It is a natural step for Google to offer Google Assistant to as many smartphones as possible because AI is at the heart of Google's strategy, said tech analyst Ian Fogg at IHS Technology. \"With the machine learning that underpins Google Assistant AI, the more people that use Assistant, the smarter it will become.\" Initially, Assistant will be available to English-speaking users in the United States. English-speaking users in Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom will receive the update next. Support for other languages will follow, Google said.",
        "The election commission (Inec) said it hoped to announce the winner on Monday. The UN has praised the poll despite technical hitches, protests and violence linked to Boko Haram. Voting spilled into a second day in some parts of Nigeria after problems with new electronic card readers. President Jonathan was among those unable to cast his vote using the technology, which was introduced to prevent fraud. His Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), who had opposed the card readers, called it a \"huge national embarrassment\". The Inec chair, Attahiru Jega, stressed that only a fraction of the 150,000 card readers being used nationwide had failed. The vote had been delayed by six weeks because of the insurgency by Boko Haram militants. Unpredictable poll Nigeria decides 2015: Full coverage The Islamists attacked polling stations in north-eastern states, with a curfew declared in Bauchi State after fighting between the security forces and the group. The UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon praised the \"determination and resilience\" of Nigerian voters, despite the reports of attacks by Boko Haram and others. He said in a statement voting had been \"largely peaceful and orderly\". His comments have been echoed by the regional bloc Ecowas, who urged Nigerians to accept the result. But there has been tension in the southern Rivers State, where thousands protested against alleged killings of opposition workers and voting irregularities. Inec said it was \"concerned\" by the complaints, adding that one of their offices was set on fire during the unrest. Results of the voting are expected to pour in through Sunday night but so far there is no official indication of which party is in the lead. The PDP has dominated Nigerian politics since 1999, but Gen Buhari's All Progressives Congress is viewed as a serious challenge. Voters are also electing members of the house of representatives and the senate.",
        "Geoffrey Stewart, 74, of Dumfries, was one of three men in their 60s and 70s who went missing in the Southern Uplands on Tuesday. Police said he died late on Wednesday night at Dumfries and Galloway Royal Infirmary. George Crosbie, 73, also from Dumfries, died earlier on Wednesday. A third man, Bobby Thomson, 64, remains in hospital. A statement from Mr Stewart's family said: \"Our family would like to extend our love and thoughts to the families involved at this very sad and tragic time. \"Sincere gratitude and appreciation goes out to all the services involved in the rescue efforts and hospital staff at Dumfries and Galloway Royal Infirmary.\" The men failed to return from a walk in the hills at Durisdeer on Tuesday. Sixteen members of Moffat Mountain Rescue team (MRT) and two search and rescue dogs combed the hills for the men until the early hours of Wednesday. However the search was stood down amid heavy rain, snow, high winds and poor visibility. When it resumed at 08:30 on Wednesday, more than 50 people were involved in the search, including neighbouring mountain rescue teams and a Coastguard helicopter. The men were found that afternoon and taken by helicopter to the hospital in Dumfries. Police said Mr Crosbie died shortly afterwards and his walking partners were treated for hypothermia. Colin Golphin, Moffat MRT leader, said: \"The weather, although OK during the day, deteriorated rapidly overnight. \"The team searched the hills during the night in extremely poor conditions. \"Our condolences are with the family of the walkers who died.\" The experienced walkers were said to be regular visitors to the Lowther Hills and were familiar with the area.",
        "Unemployment fell to 1.69 million between January and March, down 2,000 from the previous quarter. The jobless rate remained at 5.1%, the ONS said. There were 31.58 million people in work, up 44,000 from the previous quarter. That took the employment rate to a record high of 74.2%. But the number of job vacancies dropped by 18,000 to 745,000, the ONS added, marking the first fall for almost a year. David Freeman, a senior statistician at the ONS, said: \"The employment rate has hit another record high, but this time the increase is quite modest. \"With unemployment very little changed, that is further evidence the jobs market could be cooling off.\" Average earnings including bonuses rose 2% from a year earlier, up from 1.9% in the three months to February. The ONS said the timing of bonuses this year had affected the rise in total earnings. Excluding bonuses, earnings rose by 2.1% year-on-year in the three months to March, down from 2.2% in the three months to February. The number of people claiming jobless benefits fell by 2,400 in April to 737,800, although revised data showed the figure rose by 14,700 between February and March, the largest increase since autumn 2011. The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Stephen Crabb, said: \"These are another record-breaking set of figures, with more people in work than ever before and the unemployment rate is the lowest in a decade at 5.1%.\" But economists were less upbeat. David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, said that despite the UK employment rate reaching a record high, \"the cumulative picture - including manufacturing, trade and GDP figures - points to a softening in economic activity\". Paul Hollingsworth, UK economist at Capital Economics, said: \"Although there were some bright spots in today's UK labour market figures, on the whole they offered a further indication that the economic slowdown has sapped the jobs recovery of its recent vigour.\" However, Martin Beck, senior economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said: \"With the unemployment rate back to the pre-crisis average... it would be unrealistic to expect the rapid drops in unemployment seen in 2015 to continue indefinitely.\"",
        "Taibu, 32, played 28 Test matches and 150 one-day internationals for Zimbabwe prior to retiring in 2012. \"When he explained who he was I thought it was a hoax,\" Hightown publicity officer Nick Gordon said. \"The conversation developed, we got references from people in the game in Zimbabwe and we've talked ever since. It's a real coup for us.\" The wicketkeeper-batsman could make his debut for the Second Division side when they play Alder on 24 April. Speaking to BBC Radio Merseyside, Gordon said Taibu approached the club after they had advertised for an overseas player for the summer. \"It's not every day that a club like Hightown St Mary's signs a player like Tatenda,\" Gordon said. \"I had to do a double take, it was so unusual. We put out an advert for young players but he said 'I'm not a young player, I'm a retired Test cricketer.' \"This guy has played at an incredibly high standard of cricket and we are happy to take the risk. Even if he hasn't picked up a bat since 2012, he will be more than sufficient for our needs this summer.\" Signing the former international, who scored 1546 runs in 28 Test matches, also came as a shock to Hightown's players as well as their rivals. \"It was utter disbelief at the beginning,\" Gordon explained. \"The players thought it was a wind-up but, over time, people are excited about him coming over. It's not every day we get this opportunity at club level. \"There's certainly some envious eyes - I've seen some comments on Twitter asking how on earth we pulled it off. But people are looking forward to playing against him. \"These are guys who work nine-to-five, Monday-to-Friday, and they're going to turn up on a Saturday and play against an international Test captain. \"It's great for local cricket as well.\"",
        "The hashtag #penuriecarburantdansunfilm, which translates as \"fuel shortage in a film\", became France's top Twitter trend on Tuesday, with more than 5,000 tweets. A strike over new labour laws is now affecting all of France's eight oil refineries. An estimated 20% of petrol stations have either run dry or are low on supplies. In their posts, French social media users talk about films such as Total Recall, the title of both a 1990 and 2012 science fiction film. Total is also the name of a French multinational oil and gas company. Some users also changed film titles to reflect the shortage: Pulp Fiction was renamed Pump Friction, The Full Monty became The Fuel Monty and Mad Max: Fury Bicycle Lane replaced Mad Max: Fury Road. American actor Vin Diesel's surname and his Hollywood blockbusters attracted particular attention, with people inventing several titles for his Fast and Furious series: Last and Furious, Pas Fast Mais Furious (translation: Not Fast But Furious), Immobile and Furious and Fuel Furious. Others renamed 8 Mile, a semi-biographical drama staring US rapper Eminem, 0 Mile and 8 Miles a Pied (translation: 8 Miles on Foot). American director Stanley Kubrick appeared to inspire people who posted about Fuel Metal Jacket, referring to Kubrick's 1987 film Full Metal Jacket. 2001, l'Odyssee de l'espace is the French title of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. But Espace is also the name of minivan built by French car manufacturer Renault. Pictures of people filling jerrycans at petrol stations led people to incorporate the term into film titles. Tom and Jerrrycan, Jerrycan Beauty and Catch Me If You Jerrycan were the result. Another obvious target was Nicolas Winding Refn's 2011 film Drive which social media users changed to Walk and Drive Pas. Read more about France's controversial new labour laws",
        "Among them was a 17-year-old stopped at Sydney airport a fortnight ago, said Immigration Minister Peter Dutton. Mr Dutton said there was a \"growing threat\" from Australians attempting to join groups like Islamic State (IS). Special anti-terror teams were installed in Australia's eight international airports in August. The teenager, who was on his way to the conflict in the Middle East, was returned to the custody of his parents while investigations continued, said Mr Dutton. The interception came about a week after two Sydney brothers, aged 16 and 17, were stopped at the same airport on suspicion of attempting to join IS. The brothers, who have not been named, were also returned to their parents. According to Australian media reports, the two students have been allowed to resume their studies at a prestigious Sydney high school, despite concerns being raised by some parents of other students at the school. 'Trophy paraded online' Australia's anti-terrorism units have spoken to 85,000 people at airports around the country since August, said Mr Dutton. Australia estimates that about 90 of its citizens have already travelled to Iraq or Syria to fight with IS and 20 have been killed in the conflict. There are unconfirmed reports that Melbourne teenager Jake Bilardi carried out a suicide attack in Syria earlier this month after joining IS. His father, John Bilardi, said in an interview with Australia's 60 Minutes, that his son was a \"loner\" who had a \"death wish\" and had been treated as a \"prize\" by IS. \"He was a trophy that they paraded online. They gloated about how they had recruited this young boy who didn't even have a Muslim background,\" said Mr Bilardi. It is a criminal offence in Australia for citizens to set foot in the",
        "The amnesty applies to offences committed during the political turmoil after Mr Thaksin was ousted in a coup. The lower house passed the controversial bill in the early hours of Friday. It now goes to the Senate. The opposition Democrat Party has warned that the passage of the bill will trigger street protests. It did not take part in the vote, but the bill passed by 310 votes to 0. The bill's passage through the Senate is less certain, reports the BBC South East Asia correspondent Jonathan Head, as half its members are appointed. But this could happen as early as next week and would almost certainly provoke further protests. Advocates of the bill say it will draw a line under the political turmoil that resulted from the military coup in 2006 that removed Mr Thaksin from power, leaving Thailand bitterly divided. This turmoil included the occupation of Bangkok's main airport in 2008 and then two months of street protests in Bangkok in 2010 that left about 90 people - mostly civilian protesters - dead. But critics say the amnesty would allow human rights abuses to go unpunished. \"The proposed amnesty would allow officials and protest leaders who have blood on their hands to go unpunished,\" said Brad Adams, Asia director of Human Rights Watch, on 21 October. \"By whitewashing past abuses, the government denies justice to victims and tells future abusers they have little to fear.\" The opposition believes the bill is aimed at facilitating Mr Thaksin's return, without having to serve a jail sentence. Thaksin Shinawatra has lived in self-imposed overseas exile since being convicted of corruption in 2008, charges he says are politically motivated. The amnesty - initially limited to ordinary protesters charged over involvement in past street clashes - was suddenly expanded two weeks ago to include anyone investigated by agencies set up after the 2006 coup. It was as a result of one of those investigations that Mr Thaksin was jailed, our correspondent reports. In the wake of the coup Mr Thaksin remained popular with rural voters and both general elections since the polls have seen parties allied to him elected. His sister Yingluck Shinawatra is currently the prime minister. The opposition says it plans to challenge the legislation. \"We will continue our fighting in the street until the bill is aborted. There are other avenues such as by petitioning the Constitutional Court,\" said Democrat Party spokesman Chavanond Intarakomalyasut. On Thursday, as the bill was being debated, thousands of people rallied against it outside a railway station.",
        "Over the next few years Forest Enterprise Scotland will plant them around Loch Trool and the Cree Valley. It is hoped the acorns should help to grow about 600,000 young trees creating a \"large and vibrant habitat\". Environment forester Gareth Ventress said that as soon as they had seen they were in for a \"bumper crop\" of acorns they began planning to collect them. \"We also decided to get help from other staff throughout Scotland and asked them to collect acorns from other native oak woods found on the national forest estate,\" he said. \"The Cree Valley Community Woodland Trust, Borders Forest Trust and Moffat Community Woodlands all assisted in the big collection too in order to further native woodland expansion across their project areas in south Scotland. \"By combining acorns collected from across Galloway Forest Park, we increase the genetic diversity of the trees linking the remnant woodlands. \"This is vital for creating robust and resilient woodlands that can handle pests and diseases well into the future.\" The acorns are collected by laying huge felt nets across the forest floor in order to keep them off the soil and make collection easier. Once the acorns are collected they are sorted then stored. Over the next three to four years the acorn seeds will be germinated and grown so that saplings can then be planted but many of the seeds will be \"graded\" out and deemed infertile during this period. About 600,000 saplings are estimated to be likely to be produced from the acorns. These young trees will help create new oak woods and \"enrich the woodland habitats\" throughout Galloway Forest Park.",
        "Mr Carney said long-term financing of green projects in emerging markets would promote financial stability. Speaking at an event in Berlin, he urged Germany to use its G20 presidency in 2017 to make progress. Mr Carney has previously warned of climate change risks for the finance industry. At the event on Thursday, Mr Carney said that in theory capital should flow from advanced to emerging economies due to high returns. In practice, however, the opposite has happened - and this has driven down bond yields in advanced economies, he said. When money has sporadically flowed to emerging economies it has had a destabilising influence, he said. \"In this context, green finance is a major opportunity. By ensuring that capital flows finance long-term projects in countries where growth is most carbon intensive, financial stability can be promoted,\" he said. Mr Carney said the issuance of green bonds - for example, to help finance water or renewable power projects aimed at reducing carbon emissions - could double in 2016 from last year's $42bn. But they still represent only 1% of holdings by global financial institutions, he said. \"The development of this new global asset class is an opportunity to advance a low carbon future while raising global investment and spurring growth,\" he said. He elaborated on a conundrum - that by the time there is a clear economic incentive to act against climate change, it will be too late to do anything about it. A further potential problem he pointed out was that \"too rapid a movement towards a low-carbon economy could materially damage financial stability.\" As part of the transition towards a low-carbon economy, Mr Carney also urged companies to disclose the financial risks that climate change poses to their business models. Mr Carney has previously warned of the risks of climate change for the finance industry, including the possibility that the majority of fossil fuel reserves might not be recoverable as governments push to limit global warming.",
        "Gene Palmer is the second prison worker detained over the jail break. Joyce Mitchell has already been charged with aiding the escape. The prisoners, Richard Matt and David Sweat, used power tools to flee the Clinton Correctional Facility. A massive manhunt is still under way to find the pair, both convicted killers. Mr Palmer has been held on bail, after appearing before a judge on charges of promoting prison contraband, tampering with physical evidence, and official misconduct. His lawyer, Andrew Brockway, admitted his client delivered the meat but said he did not know it contained the tools, nor that the prisoners were trying to escape. \"He did pass the hamburger meat. He shouldn't have done it. He apologised for it,'' said Mr Brockway, who added his client plans to plead not guilty. Clinton County District Attorney Andrew Wylie said Ms Mitchell placed hacksaw blades and other tools inside the meat, before Mr Palmer took it to Matt and Sweat, who were interred in a section of the jail where prisoners can cook their own meals. Meanwhile, officers are concentrating their search on a 75 sq mi (194 sq km) area of northern New York state. Police found evidence the two men spent time at a hunting cabin near the prison, and it is believed they may be armed, given how heavily the area is stocked with weaponry. \"They are extremely dangerous, they're cunning,\" said New York State Police Major Charles Guess. \"Why wouldn't they try to arm themselves immediately upon escape?''",
        "The party's election manifesto said a funding floor would only be introduced after a referendum was called. The St David's Day Agreement had said the vote would be an \"expectation\", and Labour Welsh ministers oppose a referendum before a funding deal. Labour accused the Tories of trying to hold them \"over a barrel\". The manifesto states the Conservatives would \"introduce a 'funding floor' to protect Welsh relative funding and provide certainty for the Welsh Government to plan for the future, once it has called a referendum on Income Tax powers in the next Parliament\". But a Welsh Conservative spokeswoman told BBC Wales: \"The St David's Day commitment we made to introduce a funding floor for Wales is firm and clear, and work is already underway at the Treasury and the Wales Office to bring this floor forward. \"The funding floor for Wales is not contingent on an income tax referendum. Our UK manifesto makes clear our expectation that the Welsh Assembly will hold a referendum on income tax raising powers early in the next Parliament. \"More detail of our ambitious plan for Wales will be announced in the Conservative Party Welsh Manifesto which will be launched later this week.\" On Friday, Chancellor George Osborne told BBC Wales the funding floor would be between \u00a3113 and \u00a3116 per head for every \u00a3100 spent in England, the range recommended by economist Gerry Holtham. \u200b Labour has said it would also introduce a floor to the Welsh government's funding, but has not committed to a figure. Reacting to the Conservative manifesto, First Minister Carwyn Jones said: \"A vote for the Tories is a vote for a government that would cost Wales up to \u00a3300m a year. \"A fair funding settlement is either fair or it isn't - you can't impose conditions or try and hold the government over a barrel.\" The Liberal Democrats have said they",
        "Hibs were hammered 10-1 on aggregate by Bayern Munich, while City lost 3-1 to Eskilstuna United from Sweden. \"I think it is fantastic for Scottish football that we actually have two teams in the Champions League,\" Signeul told BBC Scotland. \"It just shows that what we have done has actually brought us two spots.\" Signeul pointed out that the Netherlands, who will host the Euro 2017 finals and play Scotland in a 20 October friendly in Livingston, only have one team in Europe's top club competition. \"It is all based on rankings and what Glasgow City and the national team have done previously,\" she pointed out. Hibs were making their debut in the knockout stage. \"It was a great experience for this young Hibs team and they were unlucky in the draw - played probably one of the challengers for the title this year, Bayern Munich, with 26 players in the squad all full-time professionals and all playing for their national squads; Austrians, Swiss, Germans, Dutch,\" Signeul stressed. \"Bayern Munich also had the golden boot player of the tournament in the Olympics, so it was a tough side. \"It is good for all the players at Hibs to see this is the level they want to get to. \"Sometimes you play in internationals and get a little bit cheated - you think you are better than you are because you are playing weaker teams.\" City, Scottish champions for the last nine seasons, reached the Champions League quarter-finals in 2014 but have suffered disappointment two seasons in a row in the round of 32. \"Glasgow City had a chance in their game, but Eskilstuna, the Swedish runners-up, were a little too strong for them,\" said Signeul. \"They had two good games and they were a little unlucky in the way the goals came in both games.\" The future of Signeul's Scottish FA colleague, men's head coach Gordon Strachan, was called into question this week after a draw with Lithuania and a defeat by Slovakia in their 2018 World Cup qualifiers. Signeul stressed that it was unfair to compare the success of her side to Strachan's because \"results usually follow the rankings in women's football\" while the men's game was more competitive and less predictable. She added that she believed Strachan, who has decided to remain in post, continues to have the full backing of his players.",
        "It means instead of people owning cars and bikes, one version of the future is we all hire transport to get around. This week we got another example of that in the capital when oBike launched. It is a company backed by considerable venture capital and it's putting hundreds of hire bikes on London's streets. The company aims to have thousands in the capital by the end of the summer, after already operating huge schemes in South East Asia. The big difference compared to the existing cycle hire scheme is the bikes have no docking stations. A locking rear brake means they can be left anywhere. Users access them via an app and you can find them as they have a GPS locator. There is a one-off \u00c2\u00a349 refundable deposit to be paid and then 50p per half-hour. More companies are set to follow. oBike says it is aiming to work in conjunction with the existing scheme and it has a social agenda to help clean up London's air and reduce emissions. It also wants to work with Transport for London (TfL) and local councils but unfortunately that hasn't happened. Some councils are furious they haven't been consulted and bikes have been \"dumped\" in their areas with no warning. Hackney Council, while backing cycle hire generally, says it has concerns the oBike can be left anywhere, obstructing pavements and roads. The east London local authority added it has had no dialogue with the company at all. In Hammersmith & Fulham, the west London council raised concerns with oBike when about 400 of its yellow bikes appeared in the borough unannounced. \"We're very much in favour of cycling,\" said Cllr Stephen Cowan, leader of Hammersmith & Fulham Council. \"But we expect companies to properly consult with us first. This launch could have been much better thought out.\" He said oBike has agreed to remove the bikes they have deposited in the borough. As we have seen before in London, we are getting a clash between the authorities and new technology companies. City Hall has been rather guarded in its welcome. London's Walking and Cycling Commissioner, Will Norman, said: \"We need dock-less bike operators to work with TfL and borough councils to ensure these bikes work for all Londoners and don't impact negatively on other cyclists, road users and pedestrians. \"These schemes have real potential to make cycling more accessible for many more Londoners but it is vital that they are introduced in a way that suits our capital.\"",
        "Gabon was selected as host on Wednesday by the Confederation of African Football's Executive Committee, beating rival candidates Ghana and Algeria. \"We will prepare ourselves to win the Nations Cup in 2017,\" said Gabon football official Jean-Felix Mba Nze. \"We have decided to play and win the cup.\" Gabon first entered the Nations Cup in 1970 but failed to qualify for the finals until 1994. Their best results came when reaching the quarter-finals in 1996 and 2012, a tournament they co-hosted with Equatorial Guinea. During this year's Nations Cup, which also took place in Equatorial Guinea, the Panthers crashed out early after winning one and losing two of their group games. The 2017 Nations Cup will be the first time Gabon has staged the finals by itself. \"Our main challenge is to organise a better competition than we did in 2012,\" Mba Nze, the secretary general of the Gabonese federation, told BBC Sport. \"I think we won the bid because we made a good presentation and we have made efforts to improve all the stadiums, hospitals and media facilities. \"We are more developed than we were for the last Nations Cup.\" Gabon will use two stadiums from the 2012 finals - in Libreville (capacity: 45,000) and Franceville (25,000) - while adding another two. The new venues of Port Gentil and Oyem, both of which are scheduled to be 20,000-seater stadiums, are set to be ready in August 2016, five months before the competition begins. Gabon's victory was greeted with anger by both the countries it beat. The Algerian press decried the decision, with Algeria Soir calling it a 'sporting and political defeat for Algeria' while El Watan lamented that the country's presentation was 'not sufficiently supported at political levels.' Meanwhile, the Ghanaian bid told the BBC it was 'intrigued' by the decision and asked for greater transparency in the results process, asking why the Confederation of African Football (Caf) had not made the results public. In response, Caf stated that the results of voting were not released when the host countries for the 2019, 2021 and 2023 Nations Cups were announced last September.",
        "They spend an average of \u00c2\u00a3581 a year on music festivals, often opting for VIP passes or upgraded camping options. Predominantly male, the \"superfans\" are also more likely than most consumers to buy music on CD or as downloads. The results came from a survey of 504 UK residents, who had attended at least one festival in the last year. According to ticketing website Eventbrite, which commissioned the survey, these \"superfans\" help to \"drive the music festivals market\", often recommending music and events to their friends. They account for 28% of the festival-going audience, and more than half of them (54%) say they would be willing to attend an event alone. On average, they spend \u00c2\u00a345 more per event than a casual fan, but their loyalty is not guaranteed: 46% say that festivals are becoming \"too corporate\". There are more than 100 music festivals held in the UK every year, from the likes of Glastonbury and T In The Park, to smaller events such as the Cambridge Jazz Festival and Jamie Oliver's Big Feastival. In total, 3.7 million people attend festivals every year, according to Music UK, accounting for more than 39,000 full-time jobs. However, small profit margins and a crowded market have seen some events struggle. In the wet summer of 2012, 57 festivals were forced to cancel - with the likes of Oxegen and The Big Chill shutting their doors. Although the rate of closures has slowed since then, several events - including the Temples festival in Bristol, Down To The Woods in Sedgefield and Field Day in Tunbridge Wells were called off this year; while Sonisphere failed to return from a planned hiatus in 2015. The latest research offers some reassurance to organisers though, with 88% of respondents saying they planned to attend a festival again next year - with more than half of them saying they would go to more. \"It has been a challenging year for some festivals, with inclement weather conditions, general economic uncertainty following Brexit, rising expenditure and heightened security concerns,\" said Paul Reed, who runs the Association of Independent Festivals. \"This research illustrates that the sector remains buoyant, that festival promoters are resilient and will continue to craft unforgettable experiences for audiences, who are keen to return year on year to their favourite events.\" Follow us on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, on Instagram at bbcnewsents, or email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.",

Suffolk Constabulary said it warned Norfolk Police about the group ahead of its arrival on Friday. Norfolk confirmed it was made aware and said it was reviewing its response. Suffolk officers said they told their Norfolk colleagues about the group after it was issued with a local authority notice to leave Lowestoft on Friday afternoon. The notice had been served after a number of incidents of disturbance in the town. Norfolk confirmed it had been told but said there was \"no intelligence to suggest where the group was heading\". On Friday, a woman in her late teens was raped at a bus stop in Cadogan Road, near the seafront. Norfolk Police said there was evidence to suggest it could have been linked to the disorder in the town. One man was arrested and released under investigation in connection with the rape. No other arrests have been made. On Saturday night, a BBC reporter was told by a taxi driver that \"travellers are rampaging the town\", and staff at The Wellington pub said they closed after a group of 30 travellers became \"rowdy\". Lee Sale, who runs an ice cream shop in the town, said travellers had frightened families with \"intimidating behaviour\". Ayrun Nessa, wife of the owner of the Masala Twist restaurant, said she had been confronted at the door by six women shouting abuse.

        "The A320 pilot reported seeing a white quadcopter drone \"flash past\" the aircraft while travelling south of Brookmans Park last August. No avoiding action was possible due to the lack of available time, a UK Airprox Board report said. It concluded a \"collision had only been narrowly avoided and chance had played a major part\". Air traffic control said the A320 pilot reported that \"something had just gone over the top of him\" at about 18:45 BST on 15 August 2016 while flying north of Potters Bar. The controller said another aircraft had just crossed above but the pilot said the object was red and white in colour, had red and blue stripes on two of the rotor arms and was under a metre in size. All drone operators are required to observe Air Navigation Order (ANO) 2016 articles which require a person in charge of a small unmanned aircraft to only fly the aircraft if reasonably satisfied the flight can safely be made ,and not to recklessly or negligently cause or permit an aircraft to endanger any person or property. They must also maintain \"direct, unaided visual contact\" with the aircraft that's sufficient to monitor its flight path in relation to other aircraft. Airprox board members agreed the drone had been operated at an altitude that was beyond direct unaided line-of-sight, which was not permitted under current regulations without explicit Civil Aviation Authority permission, and that it had therefore been flown into conflict with the A320. The drone operator could not be traced.",
        "A survey of employees and managers found that a quarter of new fathers took no paternity leave at all. Fewer than one in 10 took more than their two weeks statutory leave. The research by the Institute of Leadership & Management (ILM) blamed \"ingrained\" attitudes among employers, and concerns among new fathers that they could not afford to take leave. Last year the government announced plans to allow parents to share their maternity and paternity leave - changes are scheduled to come in April 2015. But the ILM said its research suggested the changes would have little impact if attitudes of employers were not addressed as well. \"The introduction of shared parental leave is a crucial step towards enabling more women to progress into senior roles,\" said Charles Elvin, ILM chief executive. \"Yet our research revealed cultural barriers are impeding the uptake of both two weeks statutory paternity leave and additional paternity leave.\" He said there remained a \"cultural expectation\" within organisations that women rather than men will be the ones taking extended periods away from the workplace. The report also said low levels of paternity pay discouraged new fathers, with just 9% surveyed receiving more than two weeks on full pay. Responding to the report, Frances O'Grady, secretary general of the TUC, the trade union body, said pay was the major concern. \"Many dads simply can't afford to take time off, particularly as employers rarely top up their statutory pay.\" Currently, employed fathers are entitled to either one or two weeks' paid paternity leave, though additional leave is also given if the mother returns to work and is not claiming statutory maternity pay. Government plans involve extending this flexibility, allowing parents of newborns to exchange and share their leave. \"We want the introduction of shared parental leave to drive a real cultural shift and help working dads play a greater role in their child's early months,\" a government spokesperson said. \"Employers too can gain from a system which allows them to keep talented women in the workforce and have more motivated and productive staff.\"",
        "As with last year's parade, only the Orangemen and their 13 notified bands can march past St Patrick's Church on Donegall Street in north Belfast. They must do so to the sound of a single drum beat. This year all music must stop 43 metres away from the church so there is no music within earshot of it. A planned residents' protest has also been restricted to a maximum of 50 people at two locations. The Orange Order has said it is appalled by the determination. \"The commission is now simply a mouthpiece for republican propaganda, allowing them to dictate the terms of when, how and where loyal order parades are held,\" it said. \"The invented new criteria of banning music within 'earshot' of a place of worship not in use, is as mischievous as it is absurd, and clearly put in place to further censor Protestant heritage on the supposed shared streets of Northern Ireland's capital city.\" North Belfast MP Nigel Dodds, of the DUP, said: \"The latest determination by the Parades Commission on Donegall Street demonstrates that this is a bureaucratic monstrosity that has lost the run of itself, simply dances to the tune of republican residents, or a dangerous combination of both. \"It is clear from the document that the Parades Commission gave serious consideration to banning music being played outside Clifton Street Orange hall. I wish that statement was a joke but it is not.\" However, SDLP assembly member Alban Maginness welcomed the determination. \"This determination by the Parades Commission is sensible and I would hope that it sets the tone for this year's marching season,\" he said. \"At every stage of this dispute all that the parishioners of St Patrick's and the residents of Carrick Hill have asked for is to be treated with respect.\"",

He is a free agent again after helping Kolkata finish fourth in the Indian league before winning the title with a play-off victory over his former club, Karela. \"We have spoken to him and offered him a deal and we're waiting to hear back,\" said McFadden, who thinks Motherwell have a tradition of welcoming back former players. \"Pearo would be a great addition on and off the park here. \"We would love to him back, so hopefully he makes the right decision and comes back. \"I know he has one or two things to think about before he makes that decision, but he knows he will be welcomed back with open arms here by everyone.\" Motherwell have signed winger Elliot Frear from Forest Green as well as adding Reading defender Zak Jules and Everton goalkeeper Russell Griffiths on loan in recent days. However, they are still looking to add to their squad before the transfer window closes. \"There could be, we are still working away on that,\" added McFadden. \"But we don't have answers back from the people we are speaking to, so we will see how it goes.\"",
        "Kevin Mcleod's body was found in Wick harbour in February 1997. The 24-year-old's death was treated as accidental, but his family believe that injuries on his body showed that he was murdered. An assessment was done of \"all information known\" regarding the death after contact between his family and chief constable Phil Gormley. Police said the review had included tracing and speaking to people who were in Wick the night Mr Mcleod died, but who had not previously come forward. Mr Mcleod's mother, June, told BBC Scotland last month that if the assessment \"turned up nothing new\" she and her family would continue to fight for a fresh investigation. A separate assessment has been ordered by the chief constable into the handling by the police of the Mcleod family's complaints since 1997 of how the death was investigated. Det Ch Supt Gareth Blair, head of major crime at Police Scotland, said the assessment was carried out \"in recognition of the continued impact\" of Mr Mcleod's death on his parents and \"their desire for a conclusive outcome\". He said: \"Our sympathies remain with them. \"It is important to stress, this was not a full reinvestigation of the death itself, but a careful and considered analysis of a significant volume of information which has been recorded relating to the circumstances since 1997. \"Specialist officers from Police Scotland's major crime command undertook this work, which included tracing and speaking to individuals who were in Wick that night and saw Kevin but who had not previously come forward.\" Det Ch Supt Blair said he told Mr Mcleod's parents on Tuesday of the conclusion of the assessment. He said: \"I informed Kevin's parents that having carried out this assessment there is no evidence of criminality and his death remains unexplained, leading me to determine that there is no basis on which to launch a full reinvestigation. \"Police Scotland appeals for any witnesses who have information about Kevin's death to come forward and we will fully consider any new and additional information. \"The chief constable has asked the head of professional standards to carry out a separate assessment to ensure that all matters/complaints raised by the family over the years have been appropriately considered and addressed.\"",
        "Matthew Eteson is on trial at Preston Crown Court for the manslaughter by gross negligence of Kelly Webster, 36, and Lauren Thornton. The pair died in their sleep aboard a boat on Windermere in April 2013. Mr Eteson, 42, from Hale in Greater Manchester, denies the charge. The family had gone to the Lake District for the Easter bank holiday weekend to celebrate a friend's birthday. But on the afternoon of 1 April, Mr Eteson removed the generator from the deck and used it to power a 1kW fan heater to heat the sleeping quarter, prosecutor Mr Graham Reeds QC said. The court was told that there had been no warning to the build-up of the toxic gas because the carbon monoxide sensors had previously been disabled. Mr Reeds said the mother and daughter, both from Leyland in Lancashire, were found dead in their sleeping positions aboard the the second-hand Bayliner 285 motor cruiser Arniston, with fatal levels of carbon monoxide in their bodies. Mr Eteson, who had been sleeping in a separate compartment further away from the generator also succumbed to the effects of carbon monoxide poisoning but did awake to find the bodies. The court also heard Mr Eteson, a qualified gas fitter, had made some amendments to the generator and its exhaust, which experts subsequently deemed to be \"dangerous\". Ms Webster's mother, Nia Webster, had previously asked Mr Eteson about carbon monoxide sensors. He told her they were not working and his partner would unplug a portable detector whenever she was cooking. The trial continues.",
        "NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) said blood group O negative was vital, as it could be used for patients with other blood groups in an emergency. It said O negative blood made up 12% of transfers, although only 7% of people in the UK had that blood type. Meanwhile, B negative blood is needed for ethnic groups. The NHSBT said ethnic minority groups, who were more likely to have B negative blood, were more prone to sickle cell anaemia, where misshapen blood cells could block blood vessels, causing an early death. It also said such groups were more at risk of developing thalassemia, a group of inherited blood disorders that hindered the blood's ability to carry oxygen. Only 2% of Britain's population were B negative, but hospitals had used 6% more of this blood type in the past last four weeks than the same period last year, said the NHSBT. B negative blood was useful as it could be used for both B negative and B positive patients, the organisation said. Donna Batty, donor relations manager at the NHSBT, asked donors to come forward in the \"next few days\". She said stocks of \"these vulnerable groups\" were \"lower than we would like\". Ms Batty added: \"We are also asking donors of those blood groups who have an appointment coming up to keep it. \"We hope our fantastic donors respond to this appeal and that they bear with us if there are slightly longer waits than normal on session as a result.\" In total, 4% of the UK's population currently donate blood. Jon Latham is assistant director of marketing of NHSBT said that ideally they wanted \"first-time donors\" to come forward. He said: \"The bigger the database we have for people willing to donate, the easier it us for us to call upon them at times of the year when when we have a need for a particular group.\" People unsure of their blood type could find out after donating, said the NHSBT. Those interested in donating are asked to call NHSBT on 0300 123 23 23.",
        "The Employment and Learning minister, Dr Stephen Farry, has decided to remove a special premium payment of \u00c2\u00a31.1m which it has been getting to compensate for its small scale and specialist status. It has fewer than 1,000 students and an income of \u00c2\u00a34.7m a year. Protesters have said that the removal of the small institution premium, coupled with a general cutback in Department of Employment and Learning (DEL) funding, would mean the college loses 31% of its budget. However, an extra \u00c2\u00a332m for the DEL, revealed in this week's overall budget improves the situation somewhat. The college says the addition of extra money means it would be asked to manage on a budget reduced by 26.5%. That's a slightly better prediction but the principal, Prof Peter Finn, says that is still far too challenging. He accuses Stephen Farry of a blatantly opportunistic decision to force the college to agree to one of the solutions he proposes for the future streamlining of teacher training in Northern Ireland. None of the four options includes St Mary's keeping its current autonomy. It says it is determined to retain its character and Catholic ethos, however, Prof Finn says he is keen for what he called \"very deep sharing\" between the various teacher training institutions. That could involve students from each being taught in other university colleges from time to time. Prof Finn strongly objects to the notion that the small scale and specialist premia only exist in Northern Ireland and therefore should be removed. He agrees the payments were removed from similar institutions in England but says those bodies, in return, were allowed to charge much higher tuition fees and were not restricted in how many students they could accept. St Mary's was not permitted that freedom. Stranmillis University College, which has mainly trained teachers for schools other than Catholic, has similar problems but has been in negotiations to merge completely with Queen's University. That process began in 2008 but has met some opposition and",
        "The investment is backed by nearly \u00a315m from the Welsh government with production due to start in late 2018. Economy Minister Edwina Hart said the deal would \"safeguard more than 750 skilled Welsh jobs for many years\". \"In a climate of stiff global competitiveness, we have been actively seeking to win a share of this investment for Wales,\" she said. \"Ford's decision to manufacture its new innovative engine here in Wales is a tribute to the reputation of the local management team and the quality and loyalty of the Welsh workforce,\" she added. The Ford Bridgend plant opened in 1980 and has fought fierce competition to win successive investments in the past worth more than \u00a32.8bn. The company has said its presence supports around 10,000 jobs in south Wales, with 1,860 employed at the plant itself. Ford said technicians based in Essex and Germany had worked together on the design and development of a new fuel-efficient range of engines. A letter from Ford to workers seen by the BBC in June said that to win the investment there would need to be a change to working conditions at Bridgend to make the plant more competitive. Welsh Conservative shadow economy minister William Graham said Friday's announcement was a sign of \"confidence in the UK government's efforts to rebuild the economy\". This is good news for workers at Bridgend as the new production will begin in 2018, just as the manufacturing of Jaguar Land Rover engines at the site will be coming to an end. It secured hundreds of jobs that may otherwise have been in jeopardy. Two hundred fixed contract workers were let go at Ford Bridgend this year when it stopped manufacturing engines for Volvo. There are concerns, though, that the new investment will mean that Bridgend can only manufacture a third of the number of engines it does at the moment. Some question why the Welsh government should be contributing \u00a315m to the investment of a multinational company in a plant it owns. Bridgend was in competition with three other European Ford plants for this work, all with governments offering financial support as standard. The automotive industry is so competitive internationally that without government backing, companies are likely to go elsewhere.",
        "S4C gets most of its income from the licence fee and UK ministers have announced a major review of the BBC. Monmouth MP David Davies told BBC Wales S4C was a \"special case as it promotes the Welsh language\". Ministers have said S4C should aim for similar cost savings as the BBC. On Thursday, Labour warned that cuts to the BBC's budget threatened S4C, but Culture Secretary John Whittingdale told MPs there was a commitment to the channel \"within the next couple of years\", and he hoped to have discussions with its management in the near future. Mr Davies told BBC Radio Cymru's Rhaglen Dylan Jones, on Friday: \"The government realise the importance of S4C and that it's more than a station, it's important to the future of the Welsh language.\" Mr Davies also hinted that the Welsh Affairs Committee, which he chairs, could consider conducting an inquiry into broadcasting, including S4C. \"These are personal views but I believe S4C to be a special case as it promotes the Welsh language and I believe it to be more important that S4C caries on more than any other BBC channel,\" he added. S4C has said it has experienced \"substantial cuts\" since 2010 and would emphasise the \"uniqueness\" of its service, and its \"value and importance, both culturally and economically\", in talks with ministers. A green paper on the future of the BBC released on Thursday noted that \"audience reach has been falling across some indigenous language services over the last few years, particularly in Wales\". It added the higher hourly cost of Welsh-language radio programming compared to English-language output \"raises concerns about value for money\".",
        "The latest Markit Report on Jobs for Scotland found sharp rises in permanent and temporary job placements in April. Growth in temporary staff demand was also at its highest in nearly a decade. However, recruiters said success was threatened by declining candidate availability as employers struggled to bring in the skills they need. The Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) said whichever party formed a government after the general election on 8 June must safeguard access to workers the country needs from abroad, as well as invest in UK jobseekers. The jobs report found growth in permanent appointments continued for the third month running in April, with the fastest rate of expansion for 21 months. This contrasted with a slowdown recorded across the UK as a whole. There was also a sharp increase in temporary placements - the steepest since August 2014. However, the availability of workers fell further in April, with the sharpest drop in the availability of permanent staff in nine months. Meanwhile, availability of Scottish temporary candidates declined at the quickest pace in nearly two years. The IT and computing, nursing/medical/care and hotel and catering sectors saw the highest growth in demand for permanent staff, while nursing/medical/care, IT and computing and engineering and construction led the way for temporary staff. The report also found that average salaries for permanent starters in Scotland rose sharply in April, while the rate at which temporary pay increased in Scotland was the fastest recorded for a year. REC chief executive Kevin Green said: \"The resurgence of the Scottish jobs market continues for the third month running. \"Demand for temporary staff is at the highest level recorded in almost 10 years as employers seek to manage Brexit uncertainty and meet consumer demand. \"News that starting salaries for permanent roles are increasing will also be welcome - there's a lot to feel good about north of the border.\" He added: \"Declining candidate availability is a threat to this success, because employers are struggling to bring in the skills they need. \"If British business is to thrive, then whichever party forms a government after 8 June needs to address the ever-shrinking pool of suitable candidates by investing in skills and career advice for UK jobseekers as well as safeguarding access to the workers we need from abroad. \"It is vital that the future immigration system is agile enough to reflect and adapt to evolving labour market needs.\"",

Although the UN deadline for the total destruction of Syria's chemical weapons is 30 June, Damascus had vowed to complete the removal of its stockpile by 27 April, after missing several deadlines. \"The biggest bulk of the chemical weapons material is removed but not yet destroyed and that counts towards the 30 June deadline. That's why it's so important to get the remainder of the chemical weapons material that is still in one site,\" Ms Kaag, the head of the OPCW-UN Joint Mission, told the BBC. She also said the UN was concerned by recent reports that Syrian forces had used chlorine gas as a weapon. Chlorine was not a substance included in the deal, which is widely seen as having averted US military action against the Syrian government. Damascus has denied using chlorine gas as a weapon. Most of Syria's chemical weapons substances exist as separate materials that only create the highly toxic warfare agents when mixed together, according to the OPCW. Ms Kaag said the facilities need to produce, prepare and launch a chemical weapons attack had been destroyed. \"What remains are the elements of a chemical weapon, but the chemical weapons programme of Syria, as per the current declaration to the OPCW under the Chemical Weapons Convention is no longer in existence,\" she said.",

The High Court in Glasgow heard he attacked her after she allegedly made a jibe about his children. Kelly, who was caught after confessing to a GP, was originally charged with murder but pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of culpable homicide. The court heard how Kelly had previously been a support worker for Ms Beattie, who suffered from a number of medical conditions including seizures. The divorced mother and Kelly later became friends and often socialised together. The social care graduate attacked her at her home, however, after she allegedly made \"derogatory\" remarks about his children. Kelly grabbed Ms Beattie and strangled her before leaving the flat. He later returned and on finding her dead sat with her body before moving it to her bed before fleeing. The court was told Kelly took a train to Edinburgh having used Ms Beattie's bank card to steal \u00c2\u00a3300 from his victim's bank account. The victim's body was found by her daughter, who had failed to establish contact, on 25 May. Kelly apparently slept rough in Edinburgh until 28 May when he attended a GP surgery and confessed to killing Ms Beattie. Kelly told a doctor that \"something bad has happened\" adding: \"I think I killed her.\" He went on: \"I remember fighting and grabbing her around the neck. I blacked out and don't remember anything until I suddenly became aware she was dead. \"I carried her body to the bed and left the house. I've not been back since.\" Kelly also said: \"We're just pals - I had been her support worker.\" Police were called and Kelly told officers the last few days had been \"torture\". The court heard Ms Beattie's injuries involved the use of \"significant force\". Judge Lord Bannatyne said the jail-term would have been seven years, but for Kelly's guilty plea. The judge said: \"On any view, given what has been said, this is a tragic case.\" Kelly mouthed \"sorry\" to the victim's two daughters as was lead handcuffed to the cells.",

Mr Museveni's supporters said his opponents had failed to offer any chance of progress.

EU observers have also criticised the poll, saying the governing party had created an \"intimidating atmosphere\" and that the opposition alleged vote rigging. While praising the \"remarkable determination\" of Ugandans to vote, EU Chief Observer Eduard Kukan said the governing National Resistance Movement's \"domination of the political landscape distorted the fairness of the campaign\". The election has been marred by sporadic violence and opposition allegations of electoral fraud, with social media sites and messaging apps blocked. Mr Besigye was put under house arrest on Friday on the suspicion he would announce the results himself, breaking electoral laws, police said. It is the fourth time Mr Besigye, candidate for the opposition Forum for Democratic Change, has taken on President Museveni. The two men were once allies, with Mr Besigye serving as Mr Museveni as his personal doctor when they were guerrilla fighters. Mr Museveni seized power in 1986 and is credited with restoring stability to Uganda. However, critics say he has become increasingly authoritarian.

General secretary Steve McNamara said: \"While it is not clear whether the driver in question was a member, we take any allegation such as this extremely seriously and would condemn any cabbie who treats anyone with such disrespect and uses abusive language in this way. \"The driver in question has put their license in jeopardy with this appalling behaviour.\" Earlier this month Allen broke down in tears on the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme while meeting 13-year-old Afghan boy Shamsher Sherin. He said he had been at the migrant camp for two months while waiting to be reunited with his father in Birmingham. He joined his father in the city about a week later. During their meeting, Allen told Shamsher: \"It just seems that at three different intervals in this young boy's life, the English in particular have put you in danger. \"We've bombed your country, put you in the hands of the Taliban and now put you in danger of risking your life to get into our country. \"I apologise on behalf of my country.

        "The deal for the 25-year-old World Cup runner-up is undisclosed but is understood to be about \u00a38m. The type of players that we try and identify to come in here are ones that add quality to the squad and he definitely will do that Fernandez joins on a four-year contract and should be included in Swansea's squad to face Burnley on Saturday subject to international clearance. He started four of Argentina's games during their run to the World Cup final. Fernandez comes in after manager Garry Monk moved to replace 27-year-old Chico Flores following his switch to Qatar. The centre-back revealed his delight in joining the Swans after getting advice from Michu. \"It has always been my dream to play in the Premier League - it is the best in the world - and I'm grateful to Swansea for giving me this opportunity,\" he said. \"I asked Michu and Jordi Amat about the club. I obviously trained with Michu at Napoli and while I was on loan at Getafe [in 2013] I played with Alvaro Vazquez. He is very good friends with Jordi, so I've spoken to them too. \"Michu told me it is a family club and the city is very relaxed. He said I was joining a very good club. All I've heard are good things about Swansea.\" The Swans play their first home Premier League match against Burnley on Saturday, 23 August following their 2-1 win away at Manchester United in their opener. Fernandez has only recently returned to training following his World Cup exploits so it is not known whether he will be ready for the match. Monk said the defender, who made 13 appearances on loan at Spanish club Getafe last season, is a good acquisition for the club. \"He brings that pedigree where he's been playing for Napoli at the top level and for Argentina at the World Cup. \"The age that he's at is very good for us and the type of player that he is. \"He's a good size, a very good footballer and someone who will suit Swansea City. \"The type of players that we try and identify to come in here are ones that add quality to the squad and he definitely will do",
        "New shots of Charlene Downes, 14, who was last seen in Blackpool town centre, were discovered during a trawl of CCTV. Her body has never been found. Her mother Karen said she was \"disgusted\" the footage had only just been found after years spent investigating the unsolved murder case. Lancashire Police said it \"understood\" Ms Downes' views. Nobody has been convicted over Charlene's death. The footage has been released on the anniversary of Charlene's 2003 disappearance - as part of the forces \"longest\" murder investigation. Ms Downes said: \"What I can't fathom is why this [the footage] was never found in the previous investigation. This is the bit I'm absolutely disgusted with. \"At the same time I'm happy with the footage and now hopefully they [the detectives] can move forward and we can get some answers. \"I want closure now... We can't move on with our lives and it's just terrible.\" Det Ch Insp Richard McCutcheon said: \"I can understand [the family's] views. We have just found the images and that's why we are publishing them now.\" Charlene is shown with her sister Rebecca in Bank Hey Street at about 15:25 GMT on 1 November, 2003, walking towards the Coral Island amusement arcade. She went home but returned to Blackpool town centre later that evening. That was the last time Charlene was seen. Police said the clothes she is wearing in the footage are the same as when she vanished. Det Supt Andy Webster said officers are looking at links between Charlene's disappearance and the \"wider issue of child sexual exploitation\" in Blackpool. He said: \"We have identified a number of people who could potentially be victims and offenders and we will be seeking to make arrests and prosecute abusers in the near future.\" A judge cleared a man of Charlene's murder in 2008 after \"grave doubts\" were raised about evidence during his second trial. The jury in his first trial failed to reach a verdict. A year later the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said police evidence-gathering errors contributed to the retrial's collapse. The IPCC found strategic and tactical failure in the management of the material and several officers were disciplined with one forced to resign in 2011. But this resignation order was overturned by a 2012 Police Arbitration Tribunal.",

She told told a jury at Oxford Crown Court she did it so that she would not be discharged from hospital. Ms Knight also denies causing grievous bodily harm with intent. She told the court she wanted her mother to remain cared for and not be sent home. She said: \"I felt terrible because I knew I was going to make mum unwell. \"It was a stupid, stupid, thing to do. If I could go back and change it, I would.\" She admitted she told a series of lies to police in January when she was questioned. The court heard she had a forged a prescription for insulin, which she had collected at a Sainsbury's store in Banbury. When asked by defence barrister Simon Mayo QC why she had insisted to officers she had not injected her mother, she said: \"I realised it was serious. I was ashamed of what I had done.\" Prosecutor John Price QC claimed she had intended to administer a lethal dose to Ms Robson before leaving the Horton. He asked: \"Why did you inject your mother with a substance which for all you knew could kill her within five minutes and do nothing for an hour and twenty minutes?\" She replied: \"I never intended my mother to die.\" Ms Knight also told the court she had attempted suicide in 2006 by injecting herself with insulin. Ms Robson died in September but the jury was told earlier in the trial that her death was not relevant to the case and had no bearing on the issues they had to consider. The trial continues.",
        "The Korea Space Launch Vehicle-1 (KSLV-1) blasted off from the Naro Space Center at 16:00 (07:00 GMT). Science Minister Lee Ju-ho said the satellite, which will collect climate data, was in its correct orbit. The launch comes weeks after North Korea used its own three-stage rocket to place a satellite into orbit, sparking international criticism. South Korea's 140-tonne rocket, known as Naro, was built in partnership with Russia, which had agreed to work with Seoul for three launch attempts. Analysis: What is driving North Korea's nuclear test plan? Previous launches in 2009 and 2010 failed, and this attempt had been postponed twice for technical reasons. But officials said Wednesday's launch from the site 480km (298 miles) south of Seoul had gone as planned and that the rocket had reached its target altitude and deployed its satellite. \"After analysing various data, the Naro rocket successfully put the science satellite into designated orbit,\" Mr Lee told reporters. He said the satellite had detached 540 seconds after launch. \"We now have leapt up a step to become a space-power nation,\" he said, adding that South Korea would use this \"overwhelming moment as a strong, dynamic force\" to help drive an independent space programme. The satellite, called Science and Technology Satellite-2C, is designed to collect climate data. The Yonhap news said it was expected to make contact with its ground station at 05:00 on Thursday, at which point its operators will be able to make the final judgement on whether the launch achieved its goals. South Korea does already have satellites in space, but they were launched from other countries. On its first attempt to carry out a launch on its own soil, in 2009, the satellite failed to detach from the rocket in orbit. In 2010, the rocket exploded seconds after take-off. Pressure for success has increased since North Korea launched a rocket that placed a satellite in orbit on 12 December. It followed the launch by announcing plans for a \"high-level nuclear test\" and more long-range rocket launches. The UN said the North Korean launch constituted a banned test of missile technology and voted to extend sanctions against Pyongyang. There have been international calls for Pyongyang not to carry out the nuclear test.",

He added that the club had been put up for sale 22 hours after the FA's decision five months ago. Allam said that an appeal was being lodged against the name change rejection with the Court of Arbitration for Sport. \"We stated earlier this year that the club would be for sale should our attempt to globally promote Hull Tigers as a brand name and as a playing name be blocked,\" he said. \"As a consequence of the FA decision on 9 April, I announced on 10 April, within 22 hours, that Hull City is for sale.\" Allam, who took charge of the club in December 2010, was asked what he would do if a buyer could not be found and the legal appeal was dismissed. \"I will give it away. Out means I'm out. Have I ever said anything and gone back on it?\" he said. Allam said he and son Ehab, who is the club's acting chief executive, would remain committed to the club for the time being. \"If the appeal comes first, ok, no harm done. If the sale comes first - sold,\" he said. He was sketchy on whether there had been interest from potential buyers and indicated he may stay on should the appeal be successful. The chairman conceded that manager Steve Bruce and his players needed stability, but pointed to his investment during the transfer window, which included the signing of Uruguay striker Abel Hernandez for a reported club record fee of \u00a310m. Hull reached the FA Cup final last season, losing 3-2 to Arsenal after going two ahead, and finished 16th in their first season back in the Premier League following promotion from the Championship.

Wood was dropped following the Rugby World Cup, with Jones telling him his performances were \"distinctly average\". \"He's improved his work-rate, his impact as a ball carrier, and he's certainly above average now,\" Jones added. \"He's got very good lineout skills and his breakdown work has improved.

        "Borrowing the names of organisations like Nasa and the Environmental Protection Agency they are directly attacking the president. Mr Trump has called climate change a hoax. The @RogueNASA account says it is the \"unofficial 'Resistance' team of NASA\". \"Not an official NASA account. Not managed by gov't employees. Come for the facts, stay for the snark,\" the account declares. BBC News contacted the rogue Environmental Protection Agency account called @ActualEPAFacts. They told us they acted to make sure \"factual information about climate change and other scientific research continues to be shared during the Trump administration\". They claimed to be three EPA employees and said they acted after a gagging order stopped them from doing interviews relating to their research. Media reports have suggested that the Trump administration sought to limit how certain government agencies - including the EPA - communicate with the public. The official EPA Twitter account has not posted since 19 January, a day before Mr Trump's inauguration. ActualEPAFacts told us they were surprised by how many people are now following their account - more than 90,000 currently - but also felt exposed by what they were doing. The other rogue accounts also have large numbers of followers. More than 370,000 are following @RogueNasa after a handful of tweets in a few days. The rogue National Park Service account @AltNatParkSer has attracted even more people, with more than a million followers after less than 300 tweets. There are also rogue accounts for the US Department of Agriculture, Forest Service and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They use similar phrases such as \"resistance\" to describe themselves and post a mixture of scientific information and attacks on Mr Trump. Some of those running the other alternative accounts also claimed to be disgruntled government agency workers, at least going by their tweets. The @AltNatParkSer account tweeted on Tuesday that they were \"being run by several active NPS rangers and friends\". However, on Thursday they said they were handing over to a different group of people - activists and journalists who were former scientists. On Tuesday the official account of Badlands National Park in South Dakota started tweeting about global warming, but those posts were later deleted. The people behind the @AltNatParkSer told us this inspired them to set up their Twitter account. The other alternative accounts also appear to have been created after the Badlands tweets were deleted, while some official US national park accounts also tweeted about climate change on Wednesday.

        "A report from British Marine, which represents the leisure, superyacht and small commercial marine industry, said superyacht revenues for the year to April 2016 had reached \u00a3605m. Revenues for the whole sector rose 1.6% to \u00a33.01bn, the first time the \u00a33bn mark has been breached since 2008-2009. However, the report predicted growth would slow during 2017. It said uncertainty over Brexit negotiations was likely to curb demand. Total revenue fell in the wake of financial crisis, reaching its lowest point in the financial year 2011-2012 of \u00a32,85bn and has been gradually picking up since then. Increased revenue from engine and equipment manufacturing, as well as a jump in sales of hire and charter boats, are believed to have driven the sales increase. Exports for the year were down 0.7% to \u00a3882m but British Marine said that in the last few months the industry had benefited from the fall in the pound against the dollar and the euro since the referendum, as it has boosted buying power from overseas customers. However, marine businesses surveyed for the report expected that the support from the strong pound would be a short-term benefit. Howard Pridding, chief executive of British Marine, said: \"The industry remains robust - revenue is growing and we are taking on more employees. \"Despite the post-referendum volatility impacting on business and consumer confidence, the industry remains bullish.\" The report said industry growth was expected to slow in 2017 \"as economic volatility increases closer to and during negotiations over the UK's exit from the European Union.\" Sunseeker and Princess are the UK's biggest superyacht companies. Globally, the industry is the fourth largest in terms of turnover.",
        "The deal unveiled by Russia on Thursday to set up four \"de-escalation zones\" is backed by Turkey and Iran. But the main Syrian opposition grouping says it has little faith in the deal. Elsewhere in Syria, activists say government aircraft have hit central Hama province, and there are reports of shelling and gunfire in other parts. The opposition High Negotiations Committee (HNC), said on Friday the safe zones plan lacked \"safeguards and compliance mechanisms\". It also said it did not accept Iran as a guarantor of the deal. The UN special envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, told the BBC the agreement was important because it was being implemented by three countries who could make it work. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said Syrian fighter jets on Saturday bombed rebel positions in Hama. A rebel commander confirmed that fighting had broken out after midnight, Reuters reports. The Syrian military have so far not commented on the issue. The so-called \"memorandum on the creation of de-escalation areas\" was announced by the Russian military after talks in Kazakhstan's capital Astana. Russia's foreign ministry published the full text of the agreement on Saturday. The objective is to halt attacks by all sides and to \"provide the conditions for the safe and voluntary return of refugees\" in addition to the speedy provision of relief supplies and medical aid. The four zones will remain in place for six months, but their borders have to be finalised by Russia, Iran and Turkey by 4 June. Under the plan, the four zones will be established in: Russian Deputy Defence Minister Alexander Fomin said on Friday that there had been no bombing raids by Russian aviation in the four zones since 1 May. But he stressed that Russia's air force would continue striking militants from the Islamic State (IS) group elsewhere in Syria. The US has expressed concern over Iran, saying the country had \"only contributed to the violence, not stopped it\". The Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad is not a signatory, but its state news agency has said it supports the plan. The Astana talks were meant to shore up an oft-violated ceasefire which was originally agreed in December. A partial cessation of hostilities was declared at the end of last year, but violence has continued on several fronts. Syria's war has claimed more than 300,000 lives since it erupted in 2011.",

Labour's executive is also expected to decide candidate selection, while some challengers have come forward for the Conservatives and Lib Dems already. The UK goes to the polls on 8 June after Prime Minister Theresa May announced plans for a snap election, subsequently endorsed by MPs by 552 votes to 13. Ms McGarry and Ms Thomson were the only two Scottish MPs to vote against the election, with SNP members abstaining. If they do not return, the SNP will need to find five candidates, including three for the seats the party did not win in 2015. A number of party activists have already announced their intention to bid for the SNP ticket in the Glasgow East and Edinburgh West seats formerly occupied by the two women. On Friday, the UK Labour party issued a call for prospective for parliamentary candidates over Twitter, inviting party members to apply with a deadline of noon on Sunday. The Scottish party's executive group is meeting over the weekend to agree their selection procedure, with leader Kezia Dugdale saying they were ready and had already been preparing for an election.

        "The charity wants 10% of the 4.8 million Syrians displaced by civil war to be resettled by the end of the year. Ahead of UN talks in Geneva on the crisis, it highlighted figures showing only 1.4% had been helped so far. Oxfam said UK plans to resettle 20,000 Syrians by 2020 were \"not good enough\", but Britain says it is also focused on providing aid to people in the region. The UK's pledge of \u00c2\u00a32.3bn to help people affected by the humanitarian crisis caused by the civil war in Syria makes it the second largest bilateral donor in the world after the US. Oxfam says while Britain has been generous in providing financial aid for those displaced by Syria's civil war, it \"can and should do more\". It argues that countries with strong economies and developed infrastructures need to shoulder a greater responsibility towards refugees than nations such as Lebanon and Jordan, where thousands of Syrians are now based. The Geneva conference should, the UK-based charity added, result in \"urgent solutions, offering people safe and legal routes to a welcome\" in other countries. Oxfam examined the pledges of 28 nations that are members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and signatories to the 1951 Convention on Refugees. It says they have promised to take in almost 130,000 of Syrian refugees, although only 67,000 have actually arrived. The 10% of Syrian refugees Oxfam wants the rich nations to take in by the end of the 2016 represents the proportion the UN says are very vulnerable and in need of resettlement. According to Oxfam's analysis, only Canada, Germany, Norway have made resettlement pledges exceeding their \"fair share\", a measure based on the size of their economies. It says five other nations - Australia, Finland, Iceland, Sweden, New Zealand - have pledged more than half of their fare share. In contrast, the UK is set to take 22% of its fair share, the US just 7%, and France only 4%. Mark Goldring, chief executive of Oxfam GB said: \"It's shocking that while people continue to flee Syria most countries have failed to provide a safe home for the most vulnerable.\"",
        "The last print edition will be on 31 December, reflecting the trend for newspapers and magazines to move online as traditional advertising declines. Newsweek merged with the internet news group the Daily Beast two years ago. The Daily Beast's founder, Tina Brown, said its site now had more than 15 million unique visitors a month, a 70% increase on last year. She said in a statement: \"Exiting print is an extremely difficult moment for all of us who love the romance of print and the unique weekly camaraderie of those hectic hours before the close on Friday night. By Ben ThompsonBusiness reporter, New York In 1933, Newsweek hit the news stands - a weekly magazine covering global events. But much like the world it's reported on over the last 80 years, much has changed in the publishing world too. Not least how consumers get their news. The number of Newsweek subscribers has slumped from more than 3 million at its peak to 1.5 million today. Couple that with falling advertising revenues for traditional print media and it's led Newsweek to ditch its print edition altogether. Newsweek Global, the digital only version, will be available via a subscription. It's a way of tapping into the 70 million consumers who now use tablet computers in the US, a figure that's soared from just 13 million two years ago. But while it's a large market, there are also more competitors, and analysts say standing out in a digital world will be tough. \"But as we head for the 80th anniversary of Newsweek next year, we must sustain the journalism that gives the magazine its purpose - and embrace the all-digital future. \"This decision is not about the quality of the brand or the journalism - that is as powerful as ever. It is about the challenging economics of print publishing and distribution.\" Newsweek rose to become the second largest US news weekly magazine, behind Time. But declining circulation and advertising saw it fall into losses. It was sold by the Washington Post Company to Sidney Harman in August 2010, and was merged with the Daily Beast three months later.

Flower, of Verwood, Dorset, was given a six-month conditional discharge and ordered to pay \u00c2\u00a3930 costs. A district judge at Bournemouth Magistrates' Court ruled he had broken laws under the Localism Act 2011. Speaking outside court, Flower refused to comment on his political future. He said: \"I am surprised and disappointed that the court has found for the prosecution this morning on a technicality. \"The decision was a conditional discharge for six months - the lowest possible penalty. \"The court emphasised the total lack of any personal gain or intent on my part.\" Flower, who is also an East Dorset councillor, voted in February 2013 on East Dorset's core strategy while non-executive director of charitable social housing company Synergy Housing Ltd, for which he received an annual allowance of about \u00c2\u00a35,000. The vote concerned whether the strategy for the area should be referred to the secretary of state for approval. He declared his interest in the charity prior to the meeting, but was found guilty of taking part in the vote \"without reasonable excuse\" despite his pecuniary interest. The core strategy included plans for redevelopment in Wimborne and, although no planning permission had been submitted, it was thought some of Synergy's social housing could be improved by developers Wyatt.

The wealthy pastor is known as \"the prophet\" to his many followers. He is one of Nigeria's best-known and influential evangelists - and is popular across Africa, with many top politicians among his flock. The US election prediction was broadcast on Mr Joshua's TV channel Emmanuel TV, which an individual uploaded to YouTube.

Winner George Kemp from Maryport, Cumbria was surprised to win as he was \"struggling\" with a chest infection. In his story he \"ended up bumping into Donald Trump and his wife in an underwater hotel\", he said. \"It was a tale about building a small submarine out of my dad's old bubble car,\" he said. \"We took the bubble car on a trip to the Isle of Man and we bumped into several famous people in a Scottish submarine made out of shortbread tins. \"Nicola Sturgeon and Alex Salmond sold some of these giant shortbread tin submarines to the United States of America.\" Last year's winner Mike Naylor, known as Monkey Liar, from Wasdale came second. Helen Jordan came third. Previous winners include comedian and television presenter Sue Perkins in 2006. In 2014 one entrant had travelled from Germany to take part. The annual event is held in front of a panel of judges and an audience at the Bridge Inn at Santon Bridge. Politicians and those in the legal profession are banned from entering as the rules deem them \"too well versed to apply\". The contest dates from the 19th Century and is held in honour of famous fibber Will Ritson, a Wasdale landlord. He once claimed that the local turnips were so big that people had to \"quarry\" into them for their Sunday lunch, and they could then be used as sheds for the Herdwick sheep from the fells.",
        "Mark Footitt took 3-52 as the visitors lost five wickets before lunch while Sam Curran dismissed England opener Haseeb Hameed for a second-ball duck. But Clark's 108 not out from 133 balls and Shivnarine Chanderpaul's steady 85 not out rebuilt the visitor's innings. Clark reached his century with a huge pulled six shortly before the close. Retired West Indies international Chanderpaul put on 55 with Ryan McLaren, calming the innings after the early wickets, before the 42-year-old was joined by Clark when Gareth Batty dismissed McLaren. The pair then shared an unbeaten partnership of 172 with Clark - batting at eight in the order - soon overtaking Chanderpaul's score, beating him to his half-century. The game was halted due to bad light in the evening session but that did nothing to halt Clark's progress. In total the 26-year-old - whose previous high score was 84 not out - hit 17 fours and three sixes in his innings. The change in fortunes for Lancashire was even more remarkable given they were five wickets down inside 22 overs. Footitt - who took eight wickets in Surrey's season opener win against Warwickshire - dismissed opener Alex Davies, Lancashire's stand-in captain Liam Livingstone and Dane Vilas while Sam and Tom Curran took a wicket apiece in the early flurry. Lancashire all-rounder Jordan Clark told BBC Radio Lancashire: \"It's an unbelievable feeling for me. It's put us in a position where we can dig in a bit more tomorrow and hopefully put the team in a good position. \"It looked quite tough early on against the new ball but when I came in the pitch had flattened out a little bit. \"Tomorrow the new ball is around the corner, so we've still got a lot of work to do.\"",

The chain has 19 stores in the UK, with new outlets planned for Exeter, Sheffield and southeast London. As well as opening 12 new stores in the year, Ikea opened 19 \"click and collect\" outlets globally in a response to changing consumer behaviour. Ikea recently began offering some items online for either home delivery or collection - a departure from its traditional model of customers loading flat-pack items onto a trolley themselves.

        "Mr Reagan and three others were injured in the shooting outside a hotel in Washington in March 1981. Mr Hinckley was found not guilty by reason of insanity but was sent for treatment to a Washington hospital. In July, a judge ruled that Mr Hinckley, now 61, was not a danger to himself or the public. Mr Hinckley had already been spending 17 days a month at his mother's home in Virginia under strict conditions. Associated Press reported that he had arrived at her home having been freed on Saturday. Marking 30 years since Reagan's shooting Life after shooting a US president As part of his release he will: The shooting, just weeks into Ronald Reagan's presidency, shocked the world. Mr Reagan was shot in the lung, but recovered. His press secretary James Brady was shot in the head, suffered brain damage and used a wheelchair for the rest of his life. Mr Brady's death in 2014 at the age of 73 was ruled to be a homicide, but no further charges against Hinckley were brought. Two law enforcement officers suffered less serious injuries in the shooting. US District Judge Paul Friedman's judgement points to medical assessments which showed that Mr Hinckley had had \"no symptoms of active mental illness\" since 1983. He had shot the president in an apparent bid to impress the actress Jodie Foster, with whom he had an obsession and whom he had subjected to what would now be termed stalking. The court order and opinion available on the website of the US District Court for the District of Columbia spell out the terms of Mr Hinckley's release, and detail his psychiatric history and treatment:",

One director said it was due to escalating costs and being owed money. Newport dairy farmer John Sollis called it a \"disaster\" for people in the area who were owed money. Documents lodged on the Companies House website show one livestock trader is owed in excess of \u00a3107,000, while others are owed significant five figure sums. In his report, liquidator Gary Stones said any payments to unsecured creditors were \"totally dependent on the collection of the Irish book debt\". The report indicated almost \u00a3470,000 was owed to Emcol by an Irish firm. Mr Sollis, who is owed almost \u00a315,000 by Emcol, said: \"It was a disaster in a sense the amount of money that people have lost in the locality and not now having a local abattoir to move stock to or casualties. \"Casualties and stock have to go further afield and that's costing us money.\" The nearest abattoir is in Cross Hands, Carmarthenshire. NFU Cymru President Stephen James is owed just over \u00a31,000 and said the loss of the abattoir was a \"huge blow\" as it dealt with injured cows. He said injured cows now had to be shot on the farm premises, resulting in a loss for farmers. One of Emcol's directors, Helen Lewis, said the collapse was down to a \"very significant amount of money\" owed to the company by an Irish firm, and the \"escalating costs of running an abattoir\". She said she had \"every sympathy\" for farmers who had lost out and \"she knew many personally\".",

Andrew Bayne, 37, of Trundleys Terrace, and his nephew Michael Bagnall, 22, of Hospital Way - both in Lewisham - were found guilty of the murder. They will be sentenced at the Old Bailey on 20 November. The court heard Mr Purdy and two of his friends - Callum Malone and Jack Walker - confronted Bagnell, and, following the \"skirmish\" last November, the defendants drove around Bermondsey looking for Mr Purdy. When they found him in Mossington Gardens, Andrew Bayne shot Mr Purdy in the head then pointed the gun towards Callum before making off. Mr Purdy suffered \"catastrophic injuries\" and died the next day, the court heard. Despite the fact Bagnall had a new girlfriend, prosecutor Crispin Aylett QC told jurors, it still \"rankled\" that she had moved on and he sent her \"threatening messages\" by phone and on Facebook. Mr Aylett said: \"Ben obviously had enough and so that Sunday, around lunchtime, with two friends to help - Callum and Jack - the three of them decided to go and confront Michael Bagnall and have it out with him. \"It was undoubtedly a very stupid thing to have sought to do and cost Ben Purdy his life.\" Bayne was also convicted of possessing a gun with intent and Bagnall of affray. As the guilty verdicts were delivered, Michael Bagnall began shouting and swearing in the dock and had to be removed by officers.",

John Summers, chief executive of the orchestra, said the project would use music to \"raise aspirations\" across other academic subjects. The school, proposed with the City Learning Trust, would be part of the free schools programme - and approval for its opening depends on the Department for Education. But the orchestra wants to open the school in September 2020, for seven to 19-year-olds, with the promise of masterclasses from musicians, access to concerts and artists in residence. The intention is for students to spend 40% of their time in specialist music classes, working with the Halle Choir, The Halle Youth Orchestra and Halle for Youth. \"The Halle has a huge amount of expertise and experience in working at high level performance, both in terms of instrumental coaching and choral training,\" said John Summers, chief executive of the Halle. \"Through our expertise we will also help develop music in the curriculum as a means of supporting academic achievement and aspiration.\" There are precedents for such a connection between orchestras and schools. In the German city of Bremen, there has been a high-profile partnership when a leading orchestra set up its rehearsal rooms and headquarters in a comprehensive school on a housing estate. The musicians of the Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie Bremen became part of the daily life of the school - and truancy rates were lowered and academic results improved.",

Belgian broadcaster described the march as \"calm and silent\". The march had been due to be held a week after the 22 March attacks, but officials asked for it to be postponed because of the security threat. Relatives of victims, and paramedics and airport staff affected by the attacks joined people of several religious faiths on Sunday's march. Flowers were carried in memory of those who lost their lives. The procession took them past the Molenbeek neighbourhood - where many of those alleged to have carried out the attacks in both Brussels and Paris had lived - and to the makeshift memorial outside the city's stock exchange. One of the organisers of the march, Hassan Bousetta, told the AFP news agency: \"When our fellow citizens, defenceless civilians, are cut down in a cowardly attack, all citizens should stand up to express their disgust and solidarity.\" The turnout was less than half of the 15,000 organisers had hoped for. The attacks in Brussels were claimed by the Islamic State militant group, which also said it was behind the gun and bomb attacks in Paris on 13 November that killed 130 people. Belgian police have made dozens of arrests in recent weeks, but the authorities - and other security agencies in Europe - are under pressure amid revelations of alleged failures and missed opportunities to stop the terror cell that carried out both attacks.",

Cairn, which made two discoveries in the area last year, estimated fields there could contain more than a billion barrels of oil. Its evaluation plan will start shortly with a 3D seismic survey. Later this year it aims to launch a multi-well exploration and appraisal programme. Edinburgh-based Cairn has a 40% interest in three blocks offshore Senegal (Sangomar Deep, Sangomar Offshore, Rufisque Offshore). Its partners include ConocoPhillips (35%) and FAR Ltd (15%), with Petrosen, the Senegal National Oil Company, retaining a 10% interest in the exploration phase. In its latest half-yearly report, Cairn also said that it had started international arbitration proceedings with the government of India over a tax row. Cairn has been prevented by Indian authorities from accessing the value of its 10% residual shareholding in Cairn India Limited (CIL). In March, the company received a tax bill for $1.6bn plus interest and penalties, covering the tax year 2006-07, when it was preparing to float Cairn India on the Mumbai stock exchange. Cairn has contested the bill and plans to seek restitution for losses resulting from the falling value of its stake in CIL. Due to the lower oil price, its value has dropped from $1bn in December 2013 to $526m, as at 30 June this year. The lower valuation saw Cairn book a $177.1m impairment loss in its first half, as it reported a post-tax loss of $230m - up from $62m a year ago. The company generates no revenue because its focus is exploration work. However, at the end of the first half, Cairn reported a cash balance of $725m. Cairn's share price was down by about 5% on Tuesday morning.",

Officials imposed a curfew in the Iraqi capital, which has now been lifted. It was the second time this month that protesters had managed to break into the city's government area. Shia Muslim cleric Moqtada Sadr condemned the use of force, and voiced support for the demonstrators' \"peaceful [and] spontaneous revolt\". At least 50 demonstrators are said to have been wounded. The protesters accuse the government of neglecting much-needed reforms, as it struggles with its campaign against the so-called Islamic State group (IS) and declining oil revenues. The Sunni jihadist group controls parts of western and northern Iraq and has been behind a wave of recent attacks that have left dozens killed. Some demonstrators managed to break into the prime minister's office and parliament. Baghdad's Green Zone houses the parliament, key government buildings and many foreign embassies. The authorities later said they had completely regained control of the area and the protesters had withdrawn. The Shia cleric and his militia group, the Mehdi Army, gained prominence after the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. galvanising anti-US sentiment. Mr Sadr's followers clashed repeatedly with US forces, whose withdrawal the cleric consistently demanded. An arrest warrant was issued for Mr Sadr in 2004 in connection with the murder of a rival cleric. His militia was also blamed for the torture and killing of thousands of Sunnis in the sectarian carnage of 2006 and 2007. Mr Sadr fled to Iran during that period. In 2011, Mr Sadr returned from his self-imposed exile to Iraq, taking a more conciliatory tone and calling for Iraqi unity and peace. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, who came to power in 2014, has promised to stamp out corruption and ease sectarian tensions. He has been pressing for radical reforms and wants to form a government of technocrats, but has been blocked by lawmakers, the BBC's Jim Muir in Baghdad reports.

The court heard how Akhtar, who was also known as Saint Pirwali Pandariman, masterminded the conspiracy over more than a decade, between 2003 and 2014. Originally from Pakistan, he was a prominent faith leader in Fenton and helped raise several million pounds in donations to fight poverty through the area's Darbar Unique Centre, the court heard. But judge Stephen Eyre said he had \"let down his followers\". He said: \"[You used] the prestige and devotion of others to facilitate this offending. \"Your role as a spiritual guide provided cover and you financed your activities through donations obtained in part because of your spiritual role\". The court heard how Akhtar kept his name off most of the paperwork, using his wife, daughter and niece to apply for mortgages. When police searched homes and offices connected to the group in September 2012, they uncovered forged documents and emails relating to the conspiracy. His wife Khadija Akhtar, 54, of Hartwell Lane, Stoke, was convicted of offences including cheating HMRC and conspiracy to obtain a money transfer by deception. She was jailed for four years and three months. Akhtar's daughter, Rushbamani Akhtar, 29, was sentenced to three-and-a-half years after being convicted of entering into an arrangement to facilitate the acquisition, retention, use or control of criminal property and conspiracy to commit fraud.

The prosecution at Newport Crown Court has alleged she was so drunk she could not have consented to sex. The defendant, who is Romanian and lives in Cardiff, denies rape. The court heard the woman lost her friends during her night out and started to walk home along Greyfriars Road, under an underpass by City Hall and then along Museum Avenue at about 02:00 GMT. It was here she was approached by the defendant and the alleged rape happened behind a bush. Claire Pickthall, prosecuting, told the jury the victim was \"so drunk she can't remember the incident happening. She can't even remember him having sex with her\". It was this intoxication, she said, that meant she was not in any state to consent. \"The actions in these circumstances amount to rape,\" Ms Pickthall said. \"He was preying on single, drunk females.\" The court heard Lee Neill, who saw Mr Hamza walking behind the National Museum of Wales with the victim, was so concerned he followed them. Suspecting something \"sinister\", Mr Neill said he took a photograph \"to use as evidence\". The flash frightened Mr Hamza, who ran off, the jury was told. After giving chase, Mr Neill lost Mr Hamza and returned to the alleged victim. He then called the police. However, the court heard when officers spoke to the victim, she was so confused she thought Mr Neill was the man who raped her. He was arrested and questioned but later released. DNA later led police to arrest Mr Hamza, the court was told. The woman told jurors she had drunk wine, cider and cocktails during her night out.

The jury heard he claimed to have seen Ms Bailey on Charlotte Street, near to her holiday home in the town, \"driving what looked to be a Range Rover or that type of 4x4, a dark colour\". He said Ms Bailey was by herself, despite defence claims she had been kidnapped by two violent men who had taken her to Broadstairs.

The comments were made at a campaign rally for Mr Trump in New Hampshire. Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton said his failure to denounce \"hateful rhetoric\" was \"disturbing and wrong\". Pointing to his first questioner at the campaign event in Rochester, the billionaire businessman said: \"I like this guy.\" \"We have a problem in this country called Muslims,\" the man said. \"We know our current president is one.

Cut it out.\" In a statement, Democratic National Committee chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz said Mr Trump's \"racism knows no bounds\". Mr Trump's campaign manager Corey Lewandowski sought to play down the incident, telling US media that \"all he heard was a question about training camps\". \"The media wants to make this issue about Obama. The bigger issue is that Obama is waging a war against Christians in this country,\" Mr Lewandowski told the Washington Post. The incident evoked a moment during the 2008 campaign when Republican nominee John McCain took the microphone away from a woman who said she did not trust Mr Obama because he was \"an Arab\". President Obama, who has spoken openly about his Christian faith, was born to an American mother and Kenyan father in Hawaii.

He told me: \"These are human beings, these are people in desperate situations - they need our help and they need our support. \"There's a very large number of people going over to Calais to take aid and support to them - we should be part of the European programme both for Syrian refugees and other refugees.\" His views on immigration are completely at odds with those of the UK Independence Party - whose leader Nigel Farage addressed his annual conference in Doncaster on the issue today. He questioned how any government could plan for school provision, for health provision if you don't know in a couple of years time - to the nearest million - how many people would actually be living in the country. And the Kent Conservative MP and former immigration minister Damian Green also says open-door immigration would be irresponsible. But Mr Corbyn insists that immigration is positive for the UK. \"Our health service, our education service, much of our industrial development in Britain, has been greatly enhanced by the work done by people who have made their homes here, paid their taxes here, worked very hard here and given us this amazing cosmopolitan society that we have.\" He said instead of being afraid of immigration people should welcome the opportunities it brings. No doubt that's a message he'll want to get across to the troops as they meet in Brighton this weekend.

Lawyers for the two men now have 30 days to appeal to the Supreme Court - Thailand's final court of appeal. The pair's mothers lodged appeals at Koh Samui court last May over concerns about the judgements, in particular the DNA evidence used in the investigation. \"We don't believe the court can say beyond reasonable doubt that Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo were responsible for the events which took place in September 2014,\" said Andy Hall, one of the families' legal advisors. Miss Witheridge, a University of Essex student from Hemsby, and Mr Miller, a civil and structural engineering graduate, were found on a beach having been bludgeoned to death. A post-mortem examination showed Miss Witheridge had been raped. Prosecutors said DNA evidence collected from cigarette butts, a condom and the bodies of the victims linked Lin and Phyo to the deaths. The men, from Myanmar, retracted their initial confessions to the offences, saying they had been tortured by police. Their lawyers argued DNA from a garden hoe - allegedly used as the murder weapon - did not match samples taken from the men. They also claimed evidence had been mishandled by police and the pair's confessions were the result of \"systematic abuse\" of migrants in the area.",

This amount is equivalent to: Source: IEP The most surprising finding, said IEP Chief Executive Steve Killelea, was the \"inequality with peace\" around the world. He said some countries in Western Europe had now reached \"quite historic levels of peace\", enjoying the lowest levels of murder rates and money spent on security \"probably in the countries' history\". But Iraq, Syria, Nigeria, South Sudan and the Central African Republic had all become more violent in the past year, the report said. The IEP said the total costs of conflict amounted to 13.4% of world GDP. \"Large increases in costs have occurred due to deaths from internal conflict, IDPs [internally displaced people] and refugee support, UN peacekeeping and GDP losses from conflict,\" the report said. It also noted that the cost of supporting some 50 million refugees and IDPs - the largest number since WWII - had risen 267% since 2008 to $128bn. The report also found that if global violence were to decrease by 10%, it would effectively give the world economy an additional $1.43 trillion - more than six",
        "Falcon and Pointer was fined \u00a3175,000 for making automated calls about PPI, and Direct Choice Home Improvements Ltd was fined \u00a350,000 for asking to speak to people's dead relatives. Both companies claimed the calls were made by a third party. Anne Jones, Assistant Commissioner for Wales, said it sent a \"clear message to callous cold-callers\". She said: \"It increasingly appears from our investigations that Swansea is the UK's cold-call capital. \"Companies in the city have been trying to cash in using ruthless business models based on illicit practices to make calls which are at best irksome and at worst distressing.\" The commissioner (ICO) has taken action against six companies since 2013. Falcon and Pointer had its licence revoked in January 2016 and told the ICO it had stopped making the calls in June 2015 - but an investigation found it made a further two million calls in the following two months. Direct Choice Home Improvements Ltd, which sells windows, doors and conservatories, received 168 complaints in six months. Ms Jones said: \"Our action will send a clear message to callous cold-callers operating in Swansea that they must follow the rules. \"We'd previously contacted both of these companies but they showed a blatant disregard for the law by continuing to make nuisance calls. Their action left many people feeling frustrated and harassed.\" Sandra Busby, managing director of the Welsh Contact Centre Forum said: \"There will always be a place in the market for credible companies who want to contact their existing customers and, as consumers, we occasionally want to find out about the best deals, offers and preferential rates. \"The market becomes very tricky when you have disreputable, unethical companies in it for a quick buck, flagrantly disregarding rules and giving the industry a bad name. The Welsh Contact Centre Forum is about the former, helping companies continually strive for best practice.\" The latest action came as the ICO published its updated Direct Marketing Guidance, which helps organisations understand the law and follow good practice.",
        "The walkout is in protest over the dismissal of two nurses involved in a violent struggle with a patient. Kevin Gregson and Peter Hilton were sacked despite using \"reasonable force\" against the unidentified patient, said the Prison Officers' Association (POA). But Mersey Care Trust, which runs Ashworth, said the evidence meant sacking the pair was its only option. More on this story and other news from Merseyside and Cheshire The dispute at the unit, one of three high security hospitals in England and Wales, began at 07:00 GMT. Steve Gillan, the POA's general secretary, said: \"I believe the general public will be outraged and extremely sympathetic to Mr Hilton and Mr Gregson, who were merely responding to a violent act in which the patient had headbutted a colleague and was spitting at staff during the incident. \"The actions of restraint were reasonable and the patient came to no harm, unlike the nurses. Whilst there should always be a duty of care towards patients the same must apply to staff.\" The trust said it was \"disappointed\" by the union's decision to strike before the case is heard at an independent employment tribunal. \"We do not believe this is in the best interests of our patients, our carers, our staff and the communities we serve,\" it said in a statement. Referring to the nurses' case the trust said it cares for \"some of the most complex and vulnerable adults in a hospital setting\". \"[And we] have an international and award-winning reputation for doing so,\" it said. \"This means our staff are highly trained... We never dismiss staff lightly. \"In the light of the evidence we felt we had no other course of action open to us than to dismiss two staff members.\" The other high-security psychiatric hospitals in England and Wales are Rampton in Nottinghamshire and Broadmoor in Berkshire.",
        "Charles Blackman's oil work Women Lovers features two nude women resting on a bed beside a cat. Art broker Mossgreen tried to promote it on Facebook, but the social media network rejected it for \"advertising adult products or services\". Mossgreen chief executive Paul Summer said the decision was \"ridiculous\". \"This is a very beautiful image that is not overtly sexual in any shape or form,\" he told the BBC. \"It's like going back to the 1950s. It's ridiculous to censor this sort of thing.\" Facebook said its decision was final, although Mossgreen has since reposted images of the work. \"Such ads lead to negative user sentiment and we have zero tolerance towards such advertisements,\" Facebook said in a message. Last month, a French teacher took Facebook to court after it suspended his account for posting an image of a nude woman painted by 19th Century artist Gustave Courbet. Mr Summer said Women Lovers was expected to sell for more than A$45,000 (\u00c2\u00a328,000; $34,000) at auction next week. \"Nobody said a single thing until Facebook suddenly decided it was going to offend somebody,\" he said. \"I don't know who they're protecting because I have two teenage daughters myself and if I said to them that this painting has been banned I think they would have laughed at me.\" Now aged 88, Blackman has been described as \"the last man standing\" from one of the great eras in Australian art. His contemporaries included modernist painters Arthur Boyd, Sidney Nolan and Albert Tucker. Last year, Blackman's painting The Game of Chess was sold by Sotheby's Australia for A$1.78m. \"Charles Blackman is the most well-regarded and respected living Australian artist,\" Mr Summer said.",
        "The Spy Who Came In From The Cold, set at the height of the Cold War, is being adapted by the Oscar-winning writer of Slumdog Millionaire, Simon Beaufoy. It follows Alec Leamas, a hard-drinking British intelligence officer whose East Berlin network is in tatters. Le Carre said he was \"very excited\" by the show, which will appear on BBC One. The series will be another co-production with US network AMC, following their joint effort on The Night Manager. Tom Hiddleston, Hugh Laurie and Olivia Colman all won Golden Globes for their roles in the drama, while the show itself was nominated for best mini series or TV film at the awards. The Spy Who Came In From The Cold is set in 1962, months after the building of the Berlin Wall. In the story, Leamas's agents are either on the run or dead - victims of the East German counter-intelligence officer Hans-Dieter Mundt. Leamas is recalled to London where he is offered a chance at revenge. The novel, written in 1963, was made into a film starring Richard Burton in 1965 and le Carre said he was looking forward to seeing it on screen again. He said: \"I'm very excited by the project, and have great confidence in the team.\" Beaufoy added: \"It's incredibly exciting to be working on the best Cold War spy story ever written.\" The show will be produced by The Ink Factory, the production company behind The Night Manager, in association with Character 7. Piers Wenger, controller of BBC Drama, said: \"Following the huge global success of The Night Manager, it's a privilege to announce that John le Carre will return to BBC One with one of the best spy thrillers ever written.\"",

According to the OUP, new technology is increasingly at the centre of the children's lives but how they are writing about it is changing fast. Words including email, mobile and Facebook are in decline, it said. They are being replaced by the likes of Instagram, Snapchat and emoji. And the word television has now been superseded by phone. The report also notes a sudden new arrival in children's sentences. The use of the hashtag symbol # to add an extra meaning or comment at the end of a sentence has become commonplace. #IblameTwitter #AndInstagram. Vineeta Gupta at the Oxford University Press said: \"This has been a significant change in usage in this year, 2015. \"Children have extended its [#] use from a simple prefix or as a search term for Twitter to an editorial device to add drama or comment.\" Other words on the technological endangered list are iPod, mp3 and Blackberry. In their place are iPhone, chat app WhatsApp and messaging site ooVoo. #keepup One of the most common plotlines in the short story competition was achieving sudden internet fame after posting a YouTube video. Rather than writing about watching videos, stories revolved around how many hits, shares and likes they were receiving for their own videos. #makesabetterstory Some of the most popular characters were Cinderella, footballer Lionel Messi, Snow White, Adolf Hitler and Wayne Rooney. What surprised researchers was how many children wrote using mythological characters such as Zeus, the Minotaur and Hercules. #theyloveZeus As a source for stories, World War One was common and world events in Ukraine and Syria were both popular but far behind the most frequent current affairs topic, Ebola. The search for a cure was one of the most regular plots. New words also appeared. Among the crop of new inventions were wellysaurus, gloomful and Stegasuarez, a mutant monster hybrid of a Stegosaurus and footballer Luis Suarez. #itbites The contest winners will be revealed on Friday on The Chris Evans Breakfast Show on BBC Radio 2 live from St James's Palace.

        "The 23-year-old Heracles forward claimed he was waiting to finalise a move to the Championship club. Slade insisted there was no truth to the reports but admitted he did have some interest in the player \"some time ago\". \"To my knowledge that's not something we're going to pursue,\" he said. Netherlands Under-21 international Weghorst began his career with FC Emmen before joining Heracles in 2014. Heracles chairman Jam Smit believed a fee had been agreed with Cardiff for Weghorst, who has also been linked with Celtic. \"I think all the forcing and all the speculation surrounding the player appears to be have come from the Netherlands,\" added Slade. \"There was an initial inquiry some time ago. That's all I can say.\" Slade would like to make up to three signings during the window to aid Bluebirds' push for a Championship play-off place, with the club currently four points off the top six. One is likely to be a striker after the departure of last season's top scorer Kenwyne Jones to Al Jazira in the United Arab Emirates. The Trinidad and Tobago international claimed on social media that the club had offered him no fresh deal to stay, but Slade believes that was not the case, \"I'm pretty sure there was a dialogue going on between Kenwyne's people, Kenwyne himself and [chief executive] Ken Choo and the board of directors,\" Slade added. He also denied claims from Rotherham Manager Neil Redfearn that the two clubs are in talks over a potential transfer for Alex Revell. Revell, 32, joined Cardiff from Rotherham in January 2015 and has scored twice in 15 league games for the Bluebirds. \"We've already lost a target type centre forward,\" said Slade. \"We need to be mindful that we're not shooting ourselves in the foot and that we have enough players in every position and every area of the pitch.\" Cardiff host League One Shrewsbury Town on Sunday in the third round of the FA Cup with defender Lee Peltier a major doubt because of illness.",
        "The walk-in service is aimed at reducing doctor appointments and to help reduce the over-use of antibiotics, NHS England said. It is hoped the scheme could result in fewer visits to GPs -potentially saving the NHS millions of pounds a year. But pharmacies say cuts in funding to the sector could jeopardise the scheme. The Sore Throat Test and Treat service, which has been trialled in 35 Boots pharmacies, will determine if an illness is caused by a virus - meaning drugs will not help - or a bacterial infection. Results from a throat swab, which measures sugars on the tongue, are provided in five minutes. Patients who can be helped by antibiotics will be prescribed them by the pharmacist and not have to see a GP. NHS chief executive Simon Stevens said the scheme will be rolled out across the country over the coming year. Dr Adam Roberts, a microbiologist at University College London specialising in antibiotic resistance, told the BBC it was \"quite an innovative step\". He said: \"Anything that reduces our reliance and our inappropriate use of antibiotics is a good thing. \"The initial data they showed using this kit showed that of around 360 individuals that took part only 36 were given a prescription, which is a massive reduction.\" Claire Ward, chairwoman of Pharmacy Voice, which represents the trade, welcomed the roll-out and said it was the \"kind of thing community pharmacies should be undertaking\". But she warned that cuts to services could prevent the scheme from working. In October, the Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee told the BBC that the government had drawn up proposals to cut funding by 12% from December. The Department of Health said no final decision had been made. The throat test is one of eight medical innovations being introduced to help the NHS modernise in the face of increasing demand. Sir Bruce Keogh, NHS England's national medical director, said \"innovation is not an option but a necessity if we are to build a sustainable NHS\". \"The innovations selected for this programme have the potential to deliver better value for the taxpayer whilst making patient interactions with the NHS safer and more personal,\" he said.",
        "The Sakurajima volcano on Japan's Kyushu island poses a \"growing threat\", researchers at the University of Bristol say. The volcano, located 49 km (30 miles) from the Sendai nuclear plant, is also close to Kagoshima, a city of 600,000. Sakurajima's last deadly eruption was in 1914, when 58 people died. The Japanese archipelago, which sits on the Pacific \"Ring of fire\", has more than 100 volcanoes. Sakurajima regularly spews ash and there are many small explosions there each year, with the latest eruption being in February. It is closely monitored by Japanese authorities and one of two volcanoes at Level 3 out of 5 levels in Japan's volcanic warning system, which means that people are warned not to to approach the volcano. \"The 1914 eruption measured about 1.5km cubed in volume,\" said the study's lead author Dr James Hickey, who has now joined the University of Exeter's Camborne School of Mines. \"From our data we think it would take around 130 years for the volcano to store the same amount of magma for another eruption of a similar size- meaning we are around 25 years away.\" A report on the activity of the volcano was published on Tuesday and teams from Bristol University and the Sakurajima Volcano Research Centre took part. Their research showed that 14 million cubic metres of magma is accumulating each year, enough to fill London's Wembley Stadium 3.5 times over. They added that the rate at which the magma is accumulating is faster than it can be expelled in its regular smaller eruptions, which led them to infer that a major eruption is likely in the next 30 years. They made these assessments based on new ways of studying and modelling the volcano's magma reservoir. Scientists say they hope these findings can help authorities plan for major eruptions. \"We know that being forewarned means we are forearmed and providing essential information for local authorities can potentially help save lives if an eruption was imminent,\" said Dr Hickey. According to an associate professor at Kyoto University, new evacuation plans have already been prepared. \"It is already passed by 100 years since the 1914 eruption, less than 30 years is left until a next expected big eruption\", said Dr Haruhisa Nakamichi, Associate Professor at the Disaster Prevention Research Institute, Kyoto University. \"Kagoshima city office has prepared a new evacuation plan from Sakurajima.\""

It was there, on the sixty-mile-per-hour B390 near Shrewton, Amesbury, that Gareth Hicks, a young man of twenty-four, met his final sleep, his life's flame extinguished within the sanctuary of a van, struck by Mr. Scott's Audi A6. Against the charge of causing death by careless driving, Maj Scott's plea rings clear, a steadfast 'no.' Prosecutor Charles Gabb painted a scene where the defendant, from Green Lane in Shepperton, Surrey, veered across the carriageway, a path forsaken amidst the tempest's rage\u2014awful weather, strong wind, and rain, he told the jurors. The Audi, he claimed, performed an uneasy dance, 'twitching,' perhaps caught in a hydroplane's dread whisper, before its first harsh kiss of metal with a BMW driven by Craig Reed. Briefly righted, a fleeting grace, the Audi then crossed the painted line once more, a final, shattering embrace with the Ford Transit van that held Mr. Hicks in slumber's gentle hold. 'On completely the wrong side of the road,' Mr. Gabb asserted, was the Audi in that moment of cruel decree. Gareth Hicks, from Bath in Somerset, was lost in slumber's gentle hold, on his way to a Salisbury construction site with colleague Patrick Gilleece of DR Groundworks. The jury learned of Maj Scott's 'substantial injuries,' a void where moments vanished, for memory's veil descends upon the crash of October 6th, 2014, shortly after seven",
        "This stringent ban, endorsed by local authorities in Urumqi and widely reported by state media, represents the latest escalation in a systematic campaign targeting Islamic attire and symbols within the predominantly Muslim region of Xinjiang. While Beijing's government consistently attributes a spate of recent violent attacks to Uighur militants, portraying them as instigators of unrest, human rights activists vehemently contend that this very violence is a direct consequence of China's pervasive and heavy-handed repression. The Uighur people, whose spiritual heritage traditionally embraced a moderate and syncretic form of Islam, have recently witnessed a discernible shift; the growing influence of stricter interpretations of the faith, emanating from regions like the Gulf and Pakistan, has manifested visibly in the increasing number of women adopting face coverings. This sartorial evolution, according to Charles Scanlon, the BBC's discerning Asia Pacific editor, is perceived by Chinese authorities not merely as a religious practice but as an overt act of defiance, particularly unsettling amidst the escalating violence gripping the region. Such prescriptive measures are not unprecedented; earlier this year, the northern city of Karamay controversially prohibited men with long beards from boarding public buses, signaling a broader pattern of state intervention in personal religious expression. Indeed, some astute observers believe that such draconian restrictions risk being counterproductive, potentially fueling the very tensions they aim to quell, especially at a juncture when many Uighurs acutely feel their distinct culture is under siege. James Leibold, a leading expert on China's ethnic policy at Melbourne's La Trobe University, powerfully articulated this concern to Reuters, predicting that the ban on face veils would paradoxically render them \"more popular as a symbol of resistance and assertion of ethno-national identity.\" He further noted the Communist Party's explicit framing of certain Islamic dress styles as inextricably linked to religious extremism, thus justifying these suppressive policies.

        "Palmer anticipates a forthcoming financial penalty from the British Horseracing Authority (BHA) in response to a regulatory infraction that occurred during Champions Day. \"It was an oversight,\" Palmer stated to BBC Sport, attributing the incident to a logistical error wherein \"the wrong kit box was left in the lorry and taken to the stables.\" This occurrence transpired as the Newmarket-based trainer's horse, Galileo Gold, secured a fifth-place finish in the prestigious Group One Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot. Regulatory guidelines strictly stipulate that horses are permitted to receive only hay-feed or water prior to a race, with other substances, such as electrolytes, being sanctioned exclusively for post-race administration. The incident triggered an official investigation, resulting in interviews conducted by stewards with employees of Palmer, as well as those associated with fellow trainers Francois Rohaut and Jean-Claude Rouget, alongside the trainers themselves, subsequent to a formal report submitted by the Equine Welfare and Integrity Officer. While Palmer awaits the BHA's official decision regarding the disciplinary action, he expressed an expectation of a \"routine fine for a rule that's been broken,\" as conveyed to BBC Radio Berkshire. He further underscored that \"there's no suggestion that anyone was trying to seek an advantage or cheat. It's simply what the rule says. The rules are the rules and you need to stick to them.\" Robin Mounsey, a BHA media spokesman, clarified the nature of the substances involved: \"Of the substances, three are electrolytes which are permitted in the stables but they just failed to clear it beforehand, while the other substance is permitted in training but just not on a race day.\" As a standard procedure, all horses implicated in the matter\u2014Signs Of Blessing, Architecture, Galileo Gold, and Almanzor, the winner of the Champion Stakes\u2014underwent routine testing",
        "Ms. Regina Hungerford, aged 56, refuted allegations of physically striking a 17-year-old student during a class session at Merthyr Tydfil College, wherein the student was reportedly engaged in listening to music. Conversely, a disciplinary panel determined that physical contact with the pupil was likely established, concluding that her professional conduct had been demonstrably \"unacceptable.\" Subsequently, on Thursday, the Education Workforce Council (EWC) imposed a suspension, articulating the rationale that \"the public interest fundamentally supports her future reinstatement to the teaching profession.\" Ms. Hungerford conceded to verbally admonishing the student and forcefully placing a book on his desk, characterizing the teenager as \"provocative and disruptive\" due to his engagement with rap music during instructional time. However, she consistently denied making direct physical contact with his head. Notably, she was acquitted, following an appeal, of a criminal charge pertaining to the alleged assault of the pupil during a mathematics lesson specifically designed for students with learning difficulties. Nevertheless, in November, a distinct disciplinary panel concluded, based on the balance of probabilities, that she had indeed initiated physical contact with the pupil, specifically to the head or hand. This panel further determined that her actions constituted an \"inappropriate\" professional response, thereby classifying it as professional misconduct. During the proceedings, the mother of three children earnestly appealed for the preservation of her \"very rewarding\" career. She articulated how the allegations had profoundly \"ruined her life,\" describing the outcome as a \"miscarriage of justice,\" yet affirmed her strong desire to persist in the teaching profession. Consequently, on Thursday, Ms. Hungerford received notification",
        "Michelle O'Neill found herself at the heart of a renewed political storm on Thursday, speaking at a poignant remembrance event in her home village of Clonoe. The gathering commemorated four men, members of the IRA, who were shot dead by the SAS in 1992 following an attack on Coalisland police station, where soldiers had opened fire on them as they abandoned a lorry used in the machine-gun assault. Her presence immediately drew sharp condemnation from DUP leader Arlene Foster, who, while not surprised by O'Neill's decision, unequivocally stated it was wrong. Yet, O'Neill remained unbowed, staunchly defending her right to attend and speak. \"There are some who would say we have no right to remember or to honour them,\" she declared, her voice resolute, \"we have absolutely every right. Everyone, it doesn't matter who you are, has the right to remember their dead in a respectful and dignified manner.\" This defense, however, did little to quell the rising tide of criticism. Sandra Overend, the Ulster Unionist Party's Mid Ulster candidate, quickly weighed in, asserting that while republicans would naturally wish to remember their dead, O'Neill's attendance hardly signaled a \"new departure\" for Sinn Fein to the wary unionist community. Echoing calls for a different path, an Alliance Party spokesperson underscored the importance of focusing on healing wounds and reconciliation when marking those who died during the Troubles, cautioning against glamorizing violence or weaponizing the past for political gain. Meanwhile, SDLP justice spokesperson Alex Attwood articulated a deeper concern, lamenting that the fundamental roadblock to justice, truth, and accountability lay in the desire of some to address the past solely on their own terms, rather than those demanded by victims and survivors, a stance he argued was precisely what impeded a decisive and ethical resolution to legacy issues.",
        "Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) identified \"fragile\" staffing levels within the force, recommending the swift implementation of improvement plans to address these vulnerabilities. This assessment followed an earlier critique of the force's response to government spending cuts, which had previously led to a judgment of \"requiring improvement\" in HMIC's Policing in Austerity: Meeting the Challenge report last year. Subsequently, inspectors revisited the force in October, noting its underperformance when benchmarked against similar forces. Specific issues were highlighted within the force control room, though it was acknowledged that a recent increase in staff was anticipated to mitigate these problems. The report characterized staffing levels as \"fragile but improving,\" recognizing recent recruitment efforts. However, it questioned the extent of the force's investment in preventive work aimed at reducing demand, expressing concern that \"it may not be tackling longer-term issues.\" Inspectors urged the force to implement its policing improvement plans more quickly and in an affordable manner, while simultaneously ensuring the ongoing effectiveness of its service delivery. Despite these concerns, HMIC also noted that the force was \"moving in the right direction and the pace of change is increasing.\" Police and Crime Commissioner Olly Martins, however, dismissed the report as \"out of date,\" arguing that publishing such an outdated \"snapshot\" could potentially undermine police force morale and mislead the public. He described the continued publication of a seven-month-old report, especially after HMIC had already conducted a subsequent inspection, as frankly \"incompetent.\" In response, HMIC confirmed a further assessment had been conducted in March and indicated plans for additional returns in May and July to monitor progress.",

This iconic UNESCO World Heritage Site truly takes your breath away, with its astounding 40,000 large, dark basalt columns, seeming to erupt right out of the churning sea. It was a truly memorable occasion, marking the Royal couple's inaugural visit to Northern Ireland's most famed tourist attraction, a place where the earth\u2019s raw power is so evident, formed when molten rock was dramatically forced up through ancient fissures to create that magnificent lava plateau.\n\nFrom that natural wonder, the Royal couple then made their way to the quaint village of Bushmills, for a truly moving commemoration of a local hero, Sergeant Robert Quigg. This courageous soldier had earned the Victoria Cross, the highest military award for valour, for his extraordinary bravery during the Battle of the Somme, where he fearlessly ventured into the line of fire, not once but many times, to search for his commanding officer. In a poignant ceremony, the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh unveiled a statue honouring the soldier, alongside a solemn commemorative stone, with his grandnephew, Leonard Quigg, adding a deeply personal touch with a short address.\n\nFollowing this heartfelt tribute, the Royal couple moved on to a more social occasion, a reception at the picturesque Portrush Golf Club, where they were welcomed as esteemed guests of the mayor for the Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council. And then, for a truly nostalgic journey, they stepped aboard a magnificent, five-carriage steam train, built way back in 1932, for a trip from Coleraine, in County Londonderry, to the charming village of Bellarena. Imagine the excitement! Large, cheering crowds had gathered in Coleraine, waving their flags, eager to catch a glimpse as the Royal guests, accompanied by delighted local schoolchildren, embarked on this special trip. Their destination was Bellarena, where the Queen had the honour of officially opening the village's brand new train station. It was a journey steeped in history, for the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh had first made this very same trip along the historic Coleraine to Londonderry railway line back in 1953, the year of her coronation, a full century after the original station had first opened its doors in 1853. This year, of course, had seen two impressive new railway platforms unveiled in Bellarena,",
        "The Institute of Public Policy Research (IPPR) critically highlighted a pervasive regional disparity, revealing that London's most disadvantaged children consistently outperform their Northern counterparts in early years development, a finding that profoundly undermines the government's rhetoric of national levelling up. Launched in Sheffield by the centre-left think tank, the report cast a skeptical eye on the efficacy of existing policies, particularly the government's claim of addressing the issue through additional funding for early years providers. This seemingly reactive measure, the IPPR implied, falls short of tackling the systemic inequalities that perpetuate such an egregious attainment gap. Beyond early years, the report meticulously detailed a series of rigorous \"tests\" or benchmarks for the government's much-vaunted Northern Powerhouse scheme, directly challenging its superficial focus on infrastructure without commensurate investment in human capital. Startlingly, research by the IPPR demonstrated that only 47% of children from the poorest families in the North achieved a good level of early years development, a stark contrast to London's 59%, signalling a deeply entrenched cycle of disadvantage. While acknowledging that five northern city-regions collectively boast nearly as many well-qualified individuals (3.6 million) as London (3.7 million), the IPPR's forecast of an impending increase in demand for skilled workers in the North implicitly questioned whether the region was adequately preparing its future workforce. Consequently, the IPPR proposed 11 crucial benchmarks for Chancellor George Osborne's flagship policy, prominently featuring the imperative to close this \"stark\" developmental gap among under-fives. Ed Cox, IPPR's director, unequivocally stated, \"We will never become a powerhouse economy when our children and young people have such a poor start in life,\" arguing for a \"generation of investment\" not merely in physical infrastructure like railways and motorways, but crucially in the North's \"human capital\"\u2014education and training, commencing from the earliest ages. His call for the devolution of \"economic powers to all corners of the North\" underscored",
        "George North, the 24-year-old winger, sustained a concerning head injury on Saturday, 3 December, after a high tackle from Adam Thompstone resulted in him landing on his head during his side's 19-11 defeat against Leicester Tigers. Northampton's director of rugby, Jim Mallinder, addressed the speculation surrounding North's future, stating that reports suggesting the player should retire from the sport were unwarranted. \"He doesn't want to be treated like that,\" Mallinder affirmed, emphasizing North's sole focus was to return to playing rugby. This incident reignited discussions surrounding North's history of head injuries; the Wales international had previously endured a six-month hiatus from the sport following a series of concussions and head trauma sustained during competitive matches, including a particularly serious concussion in March 2015 while scoring a try against Wasps.\n\nThe former Scarlets winger will consequently be sidelined for Northampton's upcoming Boxing Day fixture against Sale Sharks, a decision made despite North's own assertion that he did not lose consciousness during the incident. Mallinder relayed North's account to BBC Look East: \"He said he can remember going up in the air, he remembers landing on the floor, he remembers his head striking the floor and he said he wasn't unconscious.\" However, Mallinder clarified that this did not preclude a brief, unremembered period of unconsciousness. He noted that North was typically forthcoming about his health, stating, \"If he thought he had been concussed, then George is sensible enough to put his hand up and say 'I'm concussed and I need some time out of the game'.\" A specialist consultation on Tuesday confirmed the absence of immediate symptoms; nevertheless, due to the potential for even momentary unconsciousness, the club was compelled to classify the event as a concussive episode, necessitating North's removal from play for a minimum of two weeks.\n\nIn response to the incident, a concussion review group was",
        "In the quiet chill of January, two promising careers, those of seamer Abbott, at twenty-nine, and top-order batsman Rossouw, a younger twenty-seven, reached a poignant crossroads, their international chapters definitively closed. Rossouw, embarking upon his inaugural county season, enveloped his departure in an intriguing ambiguity, declining to illuminate whether unseen pressures from Cricket South Africa had compelled his decision. \"Perhaps, or perhaps not,\" he offered BBC Sport, the words carefully chosen. \"That particular narrative,\" he added, a hint of future revelation in his tone, \"is one reserved for a different telling, a later stage.\" At the heart of these pivotal choices lay the unique provisions of Kolpak contracts, intricate agreements that bestowed upon sportsmen from nations with specific trade ties to the European Union the coveted freedom of movement ordinarily reserved for EU citizens. These arrangements, while granting them a coveted status outside the usual 'overseas player' classification within county circuits, exacted a profound cost: the unequivocal forfeiture of their right to don their national colours on the international stage. Their decisions, made in the strategic lull before Britain\u2019s eventual departure from the European Union, marked them as pioneers within a burgeoning exodus. Abbott and Rossouw were but two figures in a significant wave of South African talent embracing this new path ahead of the burgeoning domestic season, a trend echoed by the likes of all-rounder Simon Harmer, now bound for Essex, the duo of Stiaan van Zyl and David Wiese finding new homes with Sussex, and the formidable pace of Hardus Viljoen preparing to bolster Derbyshire\u2019s ranks. For Rossouw, the immediate future gleamed with the promise of a fresh start. \"For now,\" he declared, his voice imbued with a sense of liberated purpose as he anticipated the commencement of his three-year tenure with Hampshire, \"I intend simply to immerse myself in life here in England.\" An infectious enthusiasm for the impending season radiated from him. \"My resolve is absolute, entirely unclouded by doubt,\" he asserted, \"and I foresee no shift in this conviction in the foreseeable future. My heart, my home, now resides unequivocally in England, and my aspirations extend far beyond these initial three years with Hampshire.\" Abbott, meanwhile, found solace in a four-year accord that heralded a profound homecoming. This return to Hampshire, where he",
        "Stephen Parnaby, the Conservative leader of East Riding of Yorkshire Council, beamed as he declared the announcement \"great news for the town and the wider East Riding,\" a sentiment echoing through the historic market town. The local authority, demonstrating its firm commitment, confirmed it was investing approximately \u00a3100,000 into the prestigious event, a sum considered a shrewd outlay following the inaugural race's resounding success last year, which reputedly injected a staggering \u00a350m into the region's vibrant economy. This three-day cycling spectacle, born from the overwhelming success of the Tour de France Grand Depart in 2014\u2014when over 1.2 million fervent spectators had lined the county's picturesque 320-mile (515km) route\u2014was now set to ignite similar passions, having been meticulously launched by the dedicated tourist body Welcome to Yorkshire. Mr Parnaby confidently reiterated that last year's event had already drawn thousands of enthusiastic spectators to the East Riding. \"The council feels that the judicious investment made by the authority, circa \u00a3100,000, to bring a significant part of the race here is money exceptionally well spent and will undoubtedly provide myriad opportunities for local traders to capitalise on a surge in spending, thereby significantly boosting the East Riding economy,\" he articulated with conviction.\n\nAcross Beverley, a palpable sense of anticipation and welcome permeated the air. Local amateur cyclist Ed Neilson, his eyes bright with enthusiasm, expressed his earnest hope that hosting the race's dramatic start would inspire a new wave of cycling enthusiasts to explore the town's charming streets and scenic surroundings. \"It's truly gratifying to see Beverley finally garnering the recognition it so richly deserves,\" he mused, recalling a shared",
        "The Health Secretary, Mr. Hunt, asserted that the doctors' union, the British Medical Association (BMA), had declined opportunities to engage in discussions regarding enhancements to patient care and had circulated \"misinformation\" concerning proposed contractual changes, a statement he made on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. Mr. Hunt's objective was to revise junior doctors' contracts, which he characterized as \"unfair\" in their current structure, particularly regarding weekend working. In response, the BMA maintained its willingness to negotiate and attributed the ongoing industrial action to what it termed Mr. Hunt's \"shambolic mishandling\" of the contentious matter.\n\nThe dispute, which originated in 2014, primarily revolved around adjustments to pay frameworks and provisions for weekend working, culminating in a series of strikes across England. The next scheduled industrial action was a 24-hour strike set for Wednesday, during which essential emergency care services would be maintained from 08:00 GMT, while other services would be withdrawn. When questioned by Andrew Marr about the reported low morale among junior doctors, Mr. Hunt argued that a significant factor in their discontent stemmed from alleged claims by the BMA that their pay would be reduced and their working hours extended, assertions he denied. He clarified that his proposals did not entail pay cuts and, conversely, aimed to decrease their working hours, suggesting that the union's portrayal of \"awful things\" contributed to a sense of devaluation among the doctors.\n\nConversely, Dr. Johann Malawana, chairman of the BMA's junior doctor committee, contended that Mr. Hunt was threatening to unilaterally impose a contract that junior doctors had \"roundly rejected\" through collective consultation. Dr. Malawana underscored that junior doctors already provide round-the-clock, seven-day-a-week care under their existing agreements. He argued that any expansion of comprehensive seven-day services would necessitate increased numbers of doctors, nurses, and diagnostic staff, alongside substantial additional investment to ensure effective delivery. He further cautioned that the Health Secretary's approach risked \"alienating a generation of junior doctors,\" which could have long-term implications for the future provision of patient care. Echoing this sentiment, Shadow Health Secretary Heidi Alexander accused Mr. Hunt of \"insulting the intelligence\" of junior doctors, stating on Sky News that this group",
        "The launch of what was supposed to be its flagship model has turned into a staggering fiasco for the world's largest smartphone maker, a grand ambition consumed by an unforeseen fire. As the South Korean company now scrambles, a desperate dance against the tide, to contain this burgeoning crisis, we cast our gaze back at the unfolding drama: On a bright August 2nd, Samsung unveiled its latest marvel, the Galaxy Note 7, amid great fanfare in New York, a beacon of innovation packed with new wonders like an iris scanner, promising a gaze into tomorrow. Whispers of triumph and soaring expectations followed, seeing it as Samsung's formidable rival to the impending iPhone 7. By August 19th, the gates opened, and sales began in 10 markets, including South Korea and the United States, with European shores set for October. Yet, a discordant note soon pierced the celebratory air; on August 24th, the first report of a Note 7 device \"exploding\" surfaced, a spark of fear igniting. It wasn't long before a digital chorus of dismay swelled, with users posting pictures and videos of what they claimed were their phones overheating, exploding, or catching fire, flames licking at promises. September 2nd saw Samsung announce a voluntary global recall of some 2.5 million Note 7 phones, a retreat acknowledging a flawed heart within, offering either a refund or a second chance. High above, by September 8th, the US federal aviation administration and numerous airlines worldwide issued sky-high warnings, telling passengers not to turn on or charge the Note 7 while on a plane, its wings clipped. The US Consumer Product Safety Commission, on September 9th, urged the public to power down, formally recalling the device by September 15th. Meanwhile, Samsung, with a glimmer of hope, announced its defiant return to sales in South Korea by September 28th. Yet, the shadow lengthened; September 19th brought reports of phones in China catching fire as well, though Samsung sang a different tune, claiming those batteries were from a separate supplier and unaffected. October 1st marked the phoenix's attempt to rise, with sales resuming in South Korea and the replacement of phones in full swing in the US. But a cruel echo soon emerged on October 6th: the first report of a replacement Note 7 still showing the same terrifying problems. A phone on board a Southwest Airline flight in the US emitted a fiery breath",
        "The proposed removal of thirteen fire engines, which have been conspicuously out of commission for two long years, would dramatically recalibrate the capital's emergency fleet, leaving a total of 142 active vehicles to serve a sprawling metropolis. Proponents argue that the significant financial savings reaped from this controversial measure would be strategically reinvested, enhancing the availability of vital staff to crew the specialized Fire Rescue Units, thereby bolstering specific areas of emergency response. However, the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) has vehemently condemned the plan, branding it as \"dangerous and reckless\" to permanently decommission these essential assets. In response to the growing public and internal scrutiny, the London Fire Brigade (LFB) has unveiled three distinct plans aimed at achieving the necessary financial efficiencies. Crucially, the LFB steadfastly maintains that none of these proposals will necessitate the closure of any fire stations, nor will any dedicated firefighters be compelled to abandon their posts. The Brigade also highlighted that, even with the thirteen engines temporarily sidelined, it has consistently met its demanding London-wide attendance time targets. Paradoxically, the LFB suggests that the reinstatement of these very engines would only yield a modest improvement, shaving approximately four seconds off the response time for the initial engine reaching a scene. Offering a contrasting vision, London Assembly Member Andrew Dismore has put forth an alternative proposal, advocating for the full restoration of the thirteen fire engines to active service. His plan suggests making the requisite savings by implementing an alternate crewing system at stations equipped with specialist appliances, an approach designed to preserve frontline capacity. These pivotal proposals are",
        "The news agency's official Twitter account was promptly suspended following a significant security breach, with an immediate advisory urging the public to disregard any messages originating from the compromised handle until further notice. This decisive action was taken in response to a profoundly destabilizing false message, which dramatically declared: \"Breaking: Two Explosions in the White House and Barack Obama is injured.\" The immediate repercussions were palpable, as US financial markets reacted with alarm; the Dow Jones Industrial Average experienced a precipitous drop of 150 points within moments of the tweet's dissemination and widespread retweeting, underscoring the rapid and far-reaching impact of digital misinformation. In the aftermath, the Federal Bureau of Investigation initiated a formal inquiry into the incident on Tuesday evening, while swift reassurance from the White House was crucial, with spokesman Jay Carney confirming to reporters shortly after the erroneous tweet's publication that President Obama was unharmed, a declaration that quickly stabilized financial markets and led to the recovery of lost ground. The Associated Press subsequently issued a statement acknowledging the compromise of its @AP Twitter account, explicitly refuting the false report of an attack at the White House, and the account was successfully restored and brought back online by Wednesday, marking a relatively quick resolution to the immediate operational disruption. Further details emerged regarding the modus operandi of the breach, as the agency disclosed that the attack was the culmination of persistent attempts by malicious actors to acquire the login credentials of AP journalists; while working to rectify the vulnerabilities, spokesman Paul Colford confirmed that other associated Twitter accounts had been temporarily disabled as a precautionary measure, with the wire service actively collaborating with the microblogging platform to thoroughly investigate the extent of the security compromise. An AP reporter, Mike Baker, revealed via Twitter that the @AP hack occurred less than an hour after several staff members received a highly sophisticated and convincingly disguised phishing email, which, appearing to originate from a colleague's email address, requested recipients click a link purportedly leading to a \"very important\" article on the Washington",
        "John McCormack's alarming progression for a further 30 miles in an articulated lorry, following a collision on the A9, demonstrated a profound and sustained disregard for road safety and the immediate consequences of his actions. Perth Sheriff Court heard the chilling detail that three children were present in the vehicle struck, an aggravating factor that underscored the potential for catastrophic outcomes. The subsequent judgment of 250 hours of unpaid work and a two-year driving ban, while significant, was pronounced against the backdrop of a pattern of behaviour that extended well beyond a momentary lapse.\n\nProsecutor Rebecca Kynaston painted a terrifying picture, describing how multiple northbound motorists near the House of Bruar shopping complex witnessed McCormack's lorry heading directly towards them, on the wrong side of the road. Their \"horror\" was palpable as they were forced to take desperate evasive action onto the verge, narrowly escaping a head-on collision. This sequence of near-catastrophes, tragically, culminated in the impact with a car carrying a couple and their three children. Ms Kynaston's account detailed how the lorry struck the offside of the car, scraping along its length \u2013 an event that, she rightly observed, \"one might have hoped would bring this to an end.\" Yet, despite the forcible impact that visibly bent the truck onto its wheel, McCormack continued his perilous journey, necessitating police intervention further down the A9 to finally pull over a vehicle that had become a rolling danger over \"quite a few miles.\"\n\nMcCormack, 46, from Kilmarnock, admitted to the grave charges of driving dangerously on the wrong side of the road on 11 April last year, failing to stop after an accident, and operating a vehicle rendered hazardous by its damaged condition. Defence solicitor David Holmes presented McCormack's decision to cease driving as a concession to the incident's gravity, yet his client's claim of having \"no recollection of the accident or how it could have taken place,\" beyond a fleeting memory of sneezing, struggled to",
        "Against the backdrop of an impending diplomatic crucible, a statement revealed that Foreign Affairs Secretary Perfecto Yasay was poised to raise the contentious issue at a major two-day Asia-Europe summit commencing Friday, an assembly that would place him in direct proximity to China's Premier Li Keqiang. This follows Tuesday\u2019s seismic legal pronouncement from a UN-backed tribunal, which delivered a resounding rejection of China\u2019s claims in the South China Sea, a legal blow China had already vowed to ignore, declaring the panel devoid of jurisdiction and its regional activities impervious to such international consensus.\n\nThe windswept plains of Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, would soon host the Asia-Europe Meeting Summit (Asem) \u2013 a pivotal assembly of 53 leaders from both continents, including claimant nations like Vietnam and Malaysia. This gathering, set for Friday and Saturday, marked the first major multilateral diplomatic forum since the impactful 12 July ruling, and significantly, the global debut of President Rodrigo Duterte's new Philippine administration. Representing Duterte, Mr. Yasay was tasked by the Department of Foreign Affairs with articulating, within Asem's broad agenda, the Philippines' commitment to a peaceful, rules-based approach regarding the South China Sea, alongside an urgent call for all parties to respect the tribunal's recent decision. This declaration, the most emphatic yet from Manila, subtly navigated the new government's more conciliatory stance under Duterte, a departure from his predecessor Benigno Aquino III, who had initially welcomed the ruling as a \"milestone\" without overt jubilation, even hinting at a willingness to share resources with China if the verdict favored the Philippines.\n\nChina, a formidable contender asserting dominion over nearly the entirety of the South China Sea, had, through Assistant Foreign Minister Kong Xuanyou, vehemently declared the summit an \"unsuitable place to discuss\" the matter, unequivocally stating it \"should not be put on the agenda\" \u2013 a clear attempt to circumscribe the diplomatic discourse. Emanating from an arbitration tribunal initiated by the Philippines under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), a convention both nations had ratified, Tuesday's ruling constituted a stark indictment. It found China in violation of the Philippines' sovereign rights and guilty of inflicting \"severe harm to the coral reef",
        "\"It's been a massive showcase for so much that's positive, strong and good about Wales,\" he said, the words ringing with a palpable sense of national pride. Mr Crabb further emphasized the robust and remarkably effective working relationship between his office and the Welsh government, spearheaded by First Minister Carwyn Jones. Their collective determination had ensured that the usual ebb and flow of day-to-day politics would not, for a moment, overshadow the united image of Wales working together on the global stage. Indeed, the Celtic Manor Resort had, for two intense days, transformed into a bustling crucible of international diplomacy, a truly monumental gathering hosting more than 60 world leaders, 4,000 delegates, and 1,500 journalists, marking it as one of the largest international assemblies ever held in the UK. Mr Crabb articulated the core ambition: \"We wanted it to be an opportunity to show the world the very best of Wales in terms of hospitality, quality of infrastructure and facilities. I believe this week has shown exactly that, demonstrating our capability and warmth to a truly global audience.\" He underscored the strategic vision behind the event, stating, \"We've been clear that this Nato summit needs to have a lasting economic impact for Wales. I believe the global profile of Wales this week will help that, elevating our standing in the eyes of potential investors.\" This was not merely a fleeting moment of glory; \"And with the investment summit we're organising on the back of the Nato summit, we're determined it will bring more inward investment, securing tangible benefits for our communities. Bringing world leaders, prime ministers and ambassadors here this week has all been part of that carefully orchestrated plan.\" The commitment to long-term economic gain was cemented by the announcement that the UK Investment Summit, scheduled for 20 and 21 November, would also convene at the prestigious Celtic Manor. The ultimate seal of approval arrived on Thursday from US President Barack Obama himself, whose words of genuine admiration for the warm Welsh welcome resonated deeply, praising the country for its \"extraordinary beauty, wonderful people, and great hospitality.\" Yet, despite the soaring rhetoric and the hopes of enduring benefits, a different reality was felt by the small businesses in the centre of Cardiff, who voiced their complaints that the essential security barriers and road closures had severely hampered their trade, deterring customers both in the sensitive run-up to the summit and throughout the event itself. Cognizant of these local sacrifices, First Minister Carwyn Jones paid a heartfelt tribute to residents and businesses",
        "Google Assistant, initially confined to the proprietary ecosystem of Google's Pixel phones\u2014a strategic limitation that arguably hindered broader market penetration and the accelerated collection of crucial user data\u2014is now poised for a significantly wider rollout. This service, superficially akin to Apple's Siri in its fundamental function of facilitating app interaction and information retrieval, fundamentally differs in its ambitious design to foster continuous, conversational engagement and respond to nuanced follow-up queries. LG's early adoption of the Assistant for its new G6 device signals a critical shift, moving the technology beyond Google's direct hardware control and into the broader Android OEM landscape. The imminent update, targeting hundreds of millions of users on Android 6.0 Marshmallow or 7.0 Nougat, is not merely a convenience but a calculated maneuver to embed Google's AI deeper into the mobile fabric, as articulated by product lead Gummi Hafsteinsson.\n\nHowever, this expansion unfolds within an increasingly competitive battleground for AI dominance. At the Mobile World Congress, Lenovo Moto revealed a somewhat cumbersome integration of Amazon's Alexa assistant into its Moto Z phone via a separate MotoMod, a stark contrast to Google's deep operating system integration. Similarly, Chinese tech giant Huawei's announcement at CES to include the rival Alexa assistant on its devices underscores a strategic hedging against Google's potential data monopoly and a desire to offer alternative AI ecosystems. As tech analyst Ian Fogg of IHS Technology aptly observes, this pervasive deployment is a \"natural step\" that underpins Google's core AI strategy, transforming every new user into a data point for machine learning, thereby making the Assistant progressively smarter and potentially establishing an insurmountable lead in a self-reinforcing cycle.

        "The nation held its breath as the Independent National Electoral Commission (Inec) expressed its aspiration to declare the highly anticipated winner by Monday, bringing a close to the intense electoral process. Despite the commendation from the United Nations, which lauded the overall conduct, the poll was undeniably marred by an array of technical glitches, sporadic protests, and the pervasive shadow of violence cast by the relentless insurgency of Boko Haram. Indeed, voting unexpectedly bled into a second day across various parts of Nigeria, a direct consequence of widespread malfunctions with the newly introduced electronic card readers. This pioneering technology, specifically designed to staunch the flow of electoral fraud, inadvertently became a source of significant frustration when even President Jonathan himself found he could not cast his ballot through the system. His ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), which had vociferously opposed the card readers from their inception, swiftly condemned the situation as a \"huge national embarrassment,\" a stinging indictment of the electoral preparations. In response, Inec chair Attahiru Jega, with a reassuring tone, emphasized that only a minor fraction of the 150,000 card readers deployed nationwide had actually failed. The very timing of this crucial vote had already been reluctantly postponed by six weeks, a testament to the pervasive threat posed by Boko Haram militants.\n\nThe Islamist group's audacious attacks on polling stations in the north-eastern states led to immediate and drastic measures, including the declaration of a curfew in Bauchi State following fierce skirmishes between security forces and the insurgents. Yet, amidst this volatility, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon offered a beacon of praise, highlighting the \"determination and resilience\" of Nigerian voters who bravely turned out despite the grim reports of violence from Boko Haram and other factions. He affirmed in a measured statement that the voting process had been \"largely peaceful and orderly,\" a sentiment robustly",
        "The Southern Uplands, a landscape often walked with quiet reverence, proved a formidable adversary for three seasoned men whose years bespoke a deep familiarity with its contours. Geoffrey Stewart, 74, of Dumfries, became one of them, his life's long journey ending not at home, but within the sterile walls of Dumfries and Galloway Royal Infirmary late on Wednesday night. Before him, George Crosbie, 73, another son of Dumfries, had already yielded to the mountain's cold embrace earlier that same day. Bobby Thomson, 64, the third of their walking party, now battles for recovery within the hospital's quiet confines, a testament to the harrowing ordeal. Amidst this profound sorrow, Mr. Stewart's family extended a tender hand of solace: \"Our family would like to extend our love and thoughts to the families involved at this very sad and tragic time,\" their statement read, a poignant echo of shared grief. It also carried a deep well of gratitude, \"Sincere appreciation goes out to all the services involved in the rescue efforts and hospital staff at Dumfries and Galloway Royal Infirmary,\" acknowledging the tireless fight against the inevitable. Their ill-fated Tuesday ramble into the hills near Durisdeer had dissolved into a desperate wait when they failed to return. As dusk deepened into a starless night, sixteen dedicated members of the Moffat Mountain Rescue Team, accompanied by two tireless search and rescue dogs, valiantly scoured the darkening slopes. Their desperate vigil, however, was ultimately broken by the mountain's fury: a relentless onslaught of heavy rain, treacherous snow, howling winds, and an impenetrable cloak of poor visibility forced a temporary, agonizing retreat in the small hours of Wednesday.

        "The latest economic pulse check from the Office for National Statistics unveiled a subtly shifting labour landscape, revealing that the ranks of the unemployed thinned marginally, dropping by a modest 2,000 to reach 1.69 million between January and March. Despite this slight contraction, the overall jobless rate held steadfast at 5.1%. Meanwhile, the nation's workforce swelled, embracing an additional 44,000 individuals to reach an unprecedented 31.58 million people engaged in employment, propelling the employment rate to a historic peak of 74.2%. Yet, a discernible tremor in the market manifested as available job vacancies receded for the first time in nearly a year, falling by 18,000 to settle at 745,000, a statistic that hinted at a potential easing of demand. David Freeman, a seasoned statistician at the ONS, observed this delicate balance, noting, \"The employment rate has hit another record high, but this time the increase is quite modest. With unemployment very little changed, that is further evidence the jobs market could be cooling off.\"\n\nBeneath the headline figures, the dynamics of average earnings showed nuanced movement; including bonuses, wages edged up by 2% from the previous year, a slight acceleration from the 1.9% recorded in the three months to February, a rise the ONS attributed to the specific timing of bonus payouts this year. Stripping out the impact of these fluctuating bonuses, underlying earnings growth actually softened, rising by 2.1% year-on-year in the three months to March, a marginal dip from 2.2% in the preceding quarter. Further complicating the picture, claims for jobless benefits experienced a small decline of 2,400 in April, reaching 737,800, even as revised figures revealed a more significant surge of 14,700 between February and March, marking the largest monthly increase since autumn 2011.\n\nAmidst these intricate data points, the political perspective was decidedly upbeat. Stephen Crabb, the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, heralded the numbers, declaring, \"These are another record-breaking set of figures, with more people in work than ever before and the unemployment rate is the lowest in a decade at 5.1%.\" However, a more cautious sentiment resonated among economic analysts. David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, tempered the enthusiasm, suggesting that despite",
        "Tatenda Taibu, the 32-year-old former Zimbabwean wicketkeeper-batsman, concluded a distinguished international career in 2012, having represented his nation in 28 Test matches and 150 one-day internationals. Hightown publicity officer Nick Gordon recounted his initial skepticism regarding Taibu's approach, admitting, \"When he explained who he was I thought it was a hoax.\" The astonishing nature of the inquiry prompted a thorough verification process, during which the club secured credible references from prominent figures within Zimbabwean cricket. This diligent vetting confirmed the authenticity of the approach, solidifying what Gordon now describes as \"a real coup\" for the club. The seasoned wicketkeeper-batsman is now poised to make his debut for the Second Division side, potentially featuring against Alder on 24 April. Speaking to BBC Radio Merseyside, Gordon detailed how Taibu initiated contact after the club had advertised for an overseas player for the summer. He emphasized the sheer improbability of a club of Hightown St Mary's stature securing a player of Taibu's calibre, stating, \"I had to do a double take, it was so unusual.\" Gordon elaborated on the unexpected nature of the contact, noting that the club's advertisement had specifically sought young talent. Taibu, however, candidly declared, \"I'm not a young player, I'm a retired Test cricketer,\" immediately setting his application apart from typical responses. Despite his retirement, the club expressed profound confidence in his capabilities, acknowledging, \"This guy has played at an incredibly high standard of cricket and we are happy to take the risk.\" Even with a potential hiatus from competitive play since his 2012 retirement, the club remains confident that his inherent skill and experience will render him more than sufficient for their requirements throughout the summer season. The acquisition of the former international, who amassed 1546 runs during his 28 Test matches, naturally sent ripples of shock through both Hightown's existing squad and their divisional rivals. \"It was",
        "The hashtag #penuriecarburantdansunfilm, translating to \"fuel shortage in a film,\" emerged as France's leading Twitter trend on Tuesday, generating over 5,000 tweets. This surge in online activity reflected a public response to ongoing disruptions, as a strike over new labour laws was actively impacting all eight of France's oil refineries, significantly hindering fuel distribution. Consequently, an estimated 20% of petrol stations across the nation had reported depleted or critically low fuel reserves, creating a tangible backdrop for the digital commentary. Amidst these conditions, French social media users engaged in widespread cinematic allusions. A prominent example involved *Total Recall*, the title of both a 1990 and 2012 science fiction film, ingeniously linked to Total, a major French multinational oil and gas corporation, for its phonetic and corporate resonance. Users frequently adapted existing film titles to mirror the contemporary fuel scarcity. Notable alterations included *Pulp Fiction* becoming *Pump Friction*, *The Full Monty* transforming into *The Fuel Monty*, and *Mad Max: Fury Road* being re-envisioned as *Mad Max: Fury Bicycle Lane*, each playing on phonetic similarities or thematic shifts. American actor Vin Diesel's surname and his association with high-octane Hollywood blockbusters, particularly the *Fast and Furious* series, garnered specific attention. This led to the creation of inventive new titles such as *Last and Furious*, *Pas Fast Mais Furious* (meaning \"Not Fast But Furious\"), *Immobile and Furious*, and *Fuel Furious*, directly referencing the inability to drive. The semi-biographical drama *8 Mile*, starring US rapper Eminem, was similarly reinterpreted as *0 Mile* and *8 Miles a Pied* (\"8 Miles on Foot\"), underscoring the shift from driving to walking. Director Stanley Kubrick's filmography also provided inspiration, with his 1987 film *Full Metal Jacket* becoming *Fuel Metal Jacket*. Furthermore, *2001, l'Odyss\u00e9e de l'espace*, the French title for Kubrick's *2001: A Space Odyssey*, gained a secondary layer",
        "The interception of a 17-year-old at Sydney airport, followed by two brothers aged 16 and 17 at the same location, underscores a troubling vulnerability within Australian society, one quickly framed by Immigration Minister Peter Dutton as a \"growing threat\" from citizens attempting to join groups like Islamic State (IS). While the installation of special anti-terror teams in Australia's international airports since August points to a tangible governmental response, the sheer scale of engagement\u201485,000 people questioned according to Mr. Dutton\u2014raises questions about the efficacy and potential overreach of such broad surveillance, and whether it truly targets the root causes of radicalisation or merely the symptoms of attempted travel. The decision to return these minors to parental custody, with the unnamed brothers even resuming studies at a prestigious Sydney high school despite parental concerns, highlights a perplexing ambivalence in Australia's counter-terrorism strategy. It suggests either a deeply flawed assessment of the immediate threat posed by individuals seemingly committed to violent extremism, or a critical void in comprehensive deradicalisation and reintegration programs that extend beyond mere familial oversight. This official response contrasts sharply with the tragic narrative of Melbourne teenager Jake Bilardi, whose father lamented his son being paraded as a \"trophy\" online by IS. Bilardi's case, alongside the estimated 90 Australians already fighting and 20 killed, reveals IS's chillingly effective propaganda, which exploits the vulnerabilities of \"loners\" with \"death wishes\" and packages them as symbols of ideological conquest, often irrespective of their background. The criminalisation of travel to IS strongholds like Mosul and Raqqa, punishable by ten years in prison, while ostensibly a deterrent, may ultimately serve as a punitive measure for a problem that demands more nuanced, preventative interventions to counter the insidious appeal of extremist narratives before they lead to such desperate acts.",
        "This legislative initiative, an amnesty bill, extends its provisions to encompass a range of offences committed during the profound political turmoil that followed the 2006 military coup, which unseated Mr. Thaksin Shinawatra. The controversial legislative instrument advanced through the lower house during the early hours of Friday, subsequently progressing to the Senate for further deliberation. The opposition Democrat Party has issued stern warnings that the enactment of this bill will precipitate widespread street protests. While the opposition abstained from the parliamentary vote, the bill was nonetheless passed by a significant margin of 310 votes to 0, underscoring the parliamentary majority of the ruling coalition. The trajectory of the bill through the Senate, however, remains less certain, as noted by BBC South East Asia correspondent Jonathan Head, given that half of its members are appointed rather than elected. Should this passage occur as early as the forthcoming week, it is widely anticipated to provoke further significant public demonstrations.\n\nProponents of the bill contend that its implementation is crucial for establishing a definitive resolution to the protracted political instability and deep societal divisions that have plagued Thailand since the 2006 military intervention. This period of profound national division was characterized by significant civil unrest, including the occupation of Bangkok's primary international airport in 2008 and a two-month period of sustained street protests in Bangkok during 2010, which tragically resulted in approximately 90 fatalities, predominantly among civilian demonstrators. Conversely, critics articulate profound concerns regarding the potential for such an amnesty to preclude accountability for human rights violations. As articulated by Brad Adams, Asia director of Human Rights Watch, on October 21, the proposed amnesty risks legitimizing past abuses by shielding perpetrators from justice, thereby eroding the rule of law and potentially encouraging future transgressions. This, he argues, denies justice to victims and sends a concerning message to those who might commit similar acts in the future.\n\nA central contention from the opposition posits that the bill's underlying objective is to facilitate the unencumbered return of Mr. Thaksin Shinawatra to Thailand, bypassing the necessity of serving a jail sentence. Mr. Thaksin has resided in self-imposed overseas exile since his 2008 conviction for corruption, charges he consistently maintains were politically motivated. The scope of the amnesty, initially restricted to ordinary protestors charged over involvement in past street clashes, was abruptly broadened two weeks prior to include all individuals subject to investigation by entities established in the aftermath of the 2006 coup. It was, notably, as a direct consequence of one such investigation that Mr. Thaksin was convicted and sentenced",
        "A profound hope blossoms as Forest Enterprise Scotland prepares to sow the collected acorns around the ancient whispers of Loch Trool and the vibrant embrace of the Cree Valley over the coming years. This monumental effort isn't merely about planting trees; it's an ambitious dream to cultivate approximately 600,000 young oaks, destined to weave a \"large and vibrant habitat\"\u2014a teeming sanctuary for life, buzzing with unseen energies and vital connections. Gareth Ventress, an environment forester with a keen eye for nature's subtle cues, recounted the exhilarating moment they recognized a \"bumper crop\" of acorns, a generous bounty from the forest floor, immediately sparking the meticulous planning for their collection. This vital undertaking quickly grew beyond individual efforts, as calls went out across Scotland, uniting staff from other native oak woods on the national forest estate in a shared purpose. The spirit of collaboration truly shone as the Cree Valley Community Woodland Trust, Borders Forest Trust, and Moffat Community Woodlands generously lent their hands to this \"big collection,\" each contributing to the grand vision of native woodland expansion across their cherished project areas in south Scotland. By thoughtfully intermingling acorns gathered from the diverse corners of Galloway Forest Park, they are not just planting trees, but deliberately strengthening the genetic tapestry, weaving resilience into the very fabric of the woodlands and linking scattered, precious remnants. This foresight is utterly vital, ensuring the creation of robust and enduring woodlands, capable of gracefully withstanding the challenges of pests and diseases for generations yet to come, a living legacy of foresight. The collection itself is a careful, almost reverent process, huge felt nets gently spread across",
        "Mr. Carney articulated that the strategic deployment of long-term financing for sustainable, green initiatives within emerging economies would significantly bolster global financial stability and foster sustainable development. Speaking at a distinguished event in Berlin, he underscored the critical role Germany could play by leveraging its forthcoming G20 presidency in 2017 to catalyze substantive progress on this agenda. Mr. Carney has previously issued stark warnings regarding the systemic risks posed by climate change to the resilience of the financial sector. During the event, he delineated a theoretical ideal where capital naturally gravitates from advanced to emerging economies, driven by the prospect of higher returns. In actuality, he noted, a persistent reversal of this flow has led to a compression of bond yields in advanced economies. Furthermore, the occasional and often volatile influx of capital into emerging markets has, in practice, exerted a destabilising influence on their financial systems.\n\nWithin this intricate macroeconomic context, Mr. Carney identified green finance as a significant strategic imperative. He elucidated that by channeling capital flows towards the long-term financing of projects in nations where economic growth remains most carbon-intensive, a more robust and equitable form of financial stability can be cultivated. He projected a potential doubling in the issuance of green bond instruments in 2016 from the previous year's figure of $42 billion, earmarking these for critical sustainable infrastructure development such as water management or renewable power projects aimed at mitigating carbon emissions. Despite this optimistic forecast, he highlighted that green bonds currently constitute a mere one percent of the aggregate holdings by global financial institutions, underscoring the nascent stage of this market. The proliferation of this novel global asset class, he contended, presents a unique opportunity to accelerate the transition towards a low-carbon future, simultaneously elevating global investment levels and spurring sustainable economic expansion.\n\nMr. Carney further elaborated on a profound temporal paradox: the economic incentives to decisively address climate change may only become unambiguously clear at a juncture where the opportunity for effective",
        "Another face joins the rogues' gallery, Gene Palmer, now the second prison worker ensnared in the audacious Clinton Correctional escape, a dark shadow cast by the earlier charges against Joyce Mitchell, who stands accused of aiding the very act that shook the nation. The very mention of their names, Richard Matt and David Sweat, sends a shiver through the community\u2014two convicted killers, now unfettered, having carved their way to freedom with a chilling ingenuity, leaving behind a gaping hole in the prison's facade, while a relentless, desperate manhunt echoes across the landscape for these elusive, dangerous men. Mr. Palmer, a figure of tragic complicity, faced a judge, his freedom hanging by a thread of bail, grappling with the grave accusations of promoting prison contraband, tampering with evidence, and official misconduct. His lawyer, Andrew Brockway, painted a picture of unwitting involvement, admitting his client's fateful delivery of the meat but vehemently denying any knowledge of the clandestine tools hidden within, or the dark machinations of escape. \"He did pass the hamburger meat. He shouldn't have done it. He apologised for it,\" Brockway conceded, a somber admission of a mistake that spiraled into disaster, yet maintaining a defiant \"not guilty\" plea against the tide of public suspicion. The chilling narrative spun by Clinton County District Attorney Andrew Wylie reveals a meticulous plot: Ms. Mitchell, the alleged architect of this betrayal, cunningly embedding hacksaw blades and other instruments of freedom within the unassuming ground meat, which was then, unknowingly, passed by Mr. Palmer to",
        "A funding floor, a whispered promise, seemed to rise from the manifesto's pages, yet tethered fast to a referendum's call, a vote for income tax powers, a condition woven into the very fabric of future certainty for the Welsh Government. But memory stirred, recalling the St David's Day Agreement's softer tone, where the vote was merely an 'expectation,' not a chain. Labour's Welsh voices, firm against the tide, declared no referendum should precede a fair funding's embrace, crying foul, 'held over a barrel,' by a Tory hand. Yet from the Conservative camp, a spokeswoman's voice rang clear, asserting the St David's Day pledge for a funding floor remained 'firm and clear,' its foundations already laid in Treasury halls. No true contingency, she stressed, merely an 'expectation' that the Assembly, in the Parliament's dawn, would ponder income tax's path. More ambitious melodies for Wales, she promised, would soon emerge from their Welsh manifesto's score. Then, the Chancellor, George Osborne, named the gilded range, a promise of \u00a3113 to \u00a3116 for every \u00a3100 England saw, a figure drawn from Gerry Holtham's wise counsel, a tangible floor beneath the shifting sands of finance. Labour too spoke of a floor, a protective layer for Welsh coffers, though without a precise number named. First Minister Carwyn Jones, his words sharp as a winter's breath, lashed out at the Tory vision, warning of a \u00a3300m annual drain, a 'cost to Wales.' 'Fairness,' he declared, 'is not a conditional gift, nor can it be a barrel to bind us in its grip.' Other voices joined the chorus: the Liberal Democrats seeking an independent gaze upon the funding streams, hoping to swell the Welsh budget's tide. Plaid Cymru, with a bolder plea, sought an extra \u00a31.2bn, striving for Scottish spending's parity. UKIP, ever iconoclastic, called to shatter the very mould of the Barnett formula, that ancient mechanism governing the nations' shares.",
        "Though the formidable challenge of European football proved too great, with Hibs succumbing to a resounding 10-1 aggregate defeat against the titans of Bayern Munich, and Glasgow City enduring a 3-1 loss to Sweden's resolute Eskilstuna United, a profound sense of pride permeated the Scottish football landscape. \"It is truly magnificent for Scottish football that we find ourselves with two representatives in the Champions League,\" Signeul conveyed to BBC Scotland, her words echoing the quiet triumph of dedicated effort. \"This achievement, in itself, is a testament to the groundwork we have laid, securing these coveted two spots.\" She highlighted the striking disparity with the Netherlands, the forthcoming hosts of the Euro 2017 finals and Scotland's adversaries in an upcoming October friendly in Livingston, who fielded only a single team in Europe's premier club competition. \"Such allocations are entirely predicated on historical rankings, a direct reflection of the consistent excellence displayed by Glasgow City and the national team over time,\" Signeul underscored.\n\nFor Hibs, their maiden voyage into the Champions League knockout stage was a baptism of fire, yet an invaluable education. \"It was an extraordinary experience for this youthful Hibs squad, whose unfortunate draw pitted them against arguably one of this year's strongest contenders,\" Signeul emphasized, painting a vivid picture of the formidable Bayern Munich. \"Their roster boasts 26 full-time professionals, each a pillar of their respective national teams \u2013 Austrians, Swiss, Germans, Dutch. To face a side that also included the golden boot winner from the Olympics was to confront true footballing might.\" This encounter, she mused, served as a crucial benchmark. \"It offers every player at Hibs a visceral understanding of the echelons they aspire to reach. Sometimes, in the less demanding international fixtures, a deceptive sense of one's own prowess can emerge, fostered by playing against weaker opposition.\"\n\nGlasgow City, nine-time reigning Scottish champions, had previously graced the Champions League quarter-finals in 2014, yet found themselves grappling with the bitter taste of early elimination for two consecutive seasons in the round of 32. \"While Glasgow City undoubtedly forged opportunities in their contest, Eskilstuna, the Swedish runners-up, ultimately proved a touch too formidable,\" Signeul observed. \"They contested two spirited matches, yet lady luck seemed to desert them, particularly in the manner the crucial goals were conceded across both legs.\"\n\nA stark contrast was drawn with the beleaguered position of Signeul's Scottish FA counterpart, men's head coach",
        "The evolving landscape of urban mobility increasingly suggests a future where private vehicle ownership is supplanted by a reliance on shared transport services, a paradigm shift underscored by recent developments in the capital. This week witnessed the launch of oBike, a formidable new entrant backed by substantial venture capital, which has already deployed hundreds of hire bikes across London's streets, with ambitions to scale to thousands by summer's end, leveraging extensive operational experience garnered from large-scale schemes in South East Asia. A key differentiator from existing cycle hire programmes is oBike's innovative dock-less model, which, thanks to a locking rear brake, allows bikes to be left anywhere, thereby offering unparalleled user flexibility. Access is seamlessly managed via a dedicated mobile application, which also facilitates bike location through integrated GPS technology, with users required to pay a one-off refundable deposit of \u00a349 and a usage fee of 50p per half-hour. As more companies prepare to enter this burgeoning market, oBike asserts its intention to complement established schemes, driven by a stated social agenda to ameliorate London's air quality and mitigate emissions, alongside a desire to collaborate with Transport for London (TfL) and local councils. Regrettably, this spirit of cooperation has not yet materialised, leading to considerable consternation among various councils, who express dismay at the absence of prior consultation and the unannounced \"dumping\" of bikes within their jurisdictions. Hackney Council, despite generally supporting cycle hire initiatives, voiced significant concerns regarding the potential for indiscriminately parked oBikes to obstruct pavements and roadways, noting a complete lack of dialogue with the company. Similarly, in Hammersmith & Fulham, the sudden appearance of approximately 400 yellow bikes prompted the west London council to raise immediate objections. Councillor Stephen Cowan, leader of Hammersmith & Fulham Council, affirmed the council's pro-cycling stance but emphasised the fundamental expectation for companies to engage in proper consultation, lamenting that the launch could have been far more judiciously planned; oBike has since agreed to remove the bikes deposited in the borough. This situation exemplifies a recurring tension in London between established regulatory authorities and disruptive new technology companies. City Hall's reception, while cautiously optimistic, remains guarded. Will Norman, London's Walking and Cycling Commissioner, articulated a clear expectation: \"We need dock-less bike operators to work with TfL and borough councils to ensure these bikes work for all Londoners and don't impact negatively on other cyclists, road users and pedestrians.\" He further stressed the significant potential of such schemes to enhance cycling accessibility for a wider populace, while critically asserting",
        "The Confederation of African Football's Executive Committee formally designated Gabon as the host nation on Wednesday, following a competitive bidding process that saw it prevail over rival candidacies from Ghana and Algeria. Jean-Felix Mba Nze, a prominent Gabonese football official, articulated a clear objective, stating, \"We will prepare ourselves to win the Nations Cup in 2017,\" and further affirming the nation's resolve: \"We have decided to play and win the cup.\" Gabon's historical participation in the Nations Cup commenced in 1970; however, the nation did not secure qualification for the final tournament until 1994. Their most notable achievements in the competition include reaching the quarter-finals in both 1996 and 2012, the latter being a tournament co-hosted with Equatorial Guinea. In the most recent edition, also held in Equatorial Guinea, the national team, colloquially known as the Panthers, experienced an early exit from the group stage, having secured one victory against two defeats. Significantly, the 2017 Nations Cup will mark the first instance of Gabon independently hosting the final tournament. According to Mba Nze, the secretary general of the Gabonese federation, who spoke to BBC Sport, the primary objective is \"to organise a better competition than we did in 2012.\" He attributed Gabon's successful bid to a robust presentation and substantial investments in upgrading essential infrastructure, including stadiums, medical facilities, and media amenities, remarking, \"We are more developed than we were for the last Nations Cup.\" The infrastructure plan involves utilizing two existing stadiums from the 2012 finals \u2013 the 45,000-capacity venue in Libreville and the 25,000-capacity stadium in Franceville \u2013 complemented by the construction of two new venues. These additional stadiums, located in Port Gentil and Oyem, each designed to accommodate 20,000 spectators, are projected for completion by August 2016, five months prior to the commencement of the tournament. Gabon's successful bid was met with considerable discontent from the defeated nations. The Algerian press, for instance, vehemently criticized the decision; *Algeria Soir* characterized it as a 'sporting and political defeat for Algeria,' while *El Watan* expressed concern that the nation's presentation had been 'not sufficiently supported at political levels.' Concurrently, the Ghanaian bidding",
        "They dedicate an impressive average of \u00a3581 annually to music festivals, often indulging in lavish VIP passes offering exclusive access and creature comforts, or luxurious upgraded camping options promising a touch of glamping amidst the muddy fields. A distinct demographic, predominantly male, these dedicated \"superfans\" exhibit a profound engagement with music beyond live attendance, showing a nostalgic inclination towards physical media like CDs or a digital preference for downloads, a testament to their deep-seated passion. These illuminating insights were gleaned from a comprehensive survey of 504 UK residents, each having immersed themselves in at least one vibrant festival experience over the past year. Ticketing giant Eventbrite, the visionary behind this research, posits that these \"superfans\" are the pulsating heart driving the music festivals market, their fervent word-of-mouth recommendations often swaying their social circles towards new sounds and exhilarating experiences. Representing a significant 28% of the entire festival-going audience, their dedication runs so deep that more than half (54%) express a readiness to embark on these musical pilgrimages solo, unfazed by the prospect of solitary revelry. While they outspend a casual attendee by an average of \u00a345 per event, their fervent loyalty is not an unyielding constant; a telling 46% voice concerns that the authentic spirit of festivals is increasingly overshadowed by a pervasive \"corporate\" sheen, threatening to dilute the unique charm that initially drew them in.\n\nThe UK's vibrant cultural calendar boasts a staggering array of over 100 music festivals annually, a rich tapestry stretching from the legendary, sprawling fields of Glastonbury and the iconic T In The Park, to more intimate, niche gatherings like the sophisticated Cambridge Jazz Festival and the culinary-infused Jamie Oliver's Big Feastival. This thriving ecosystem attracts a colossal 3.7 million attendees each year, as reported by Music UK, collectively sustaining an impressive workforce of over 39,000 full-time jobs. Yet, this effervescent scene is not without its trials; slender profit margins and an increasingly saturated market have cast long shadows over many events, leading to significant struggles. The notoriously wet summer of 2012 proved particularly brutal, forcing a staggering 57 festivals to abandon their plans, with prominent names like Oxegen and The Big Chill permanently shuttering their gates. While the relentless wave of closures has somewhat receded in recent years, the current year has still witnessed the unfortunate cancellation of several anticipated gatherings, including Bristol's Temples festival, Down To The Woods",
        "Cromer, typically a tranquil coastal haven, found its weekend peace shattered by an alarming surge of 37 recorded crimes, a figure made all the more chilling by the brutal rape of a teenager. The town's residents, grappling with this sudden wave of disorder, pointed fingers squarely at a group of travellers whose arrival had coincided with the chaos. A disquieting sense of foreboding had, in fact, preceded the group's arrival. Suffolk Constabulary, having issued the travellers with a local authority notice to quit Lowestoft after a spate of disturbances there, had explicitly alerted Norfolk Police on Friday afternoon. The warning, a clear signal of potential trouble, was acknowledged by Norfolk, yet their subsequent actions, or lack thereof, would come under intense scrutiny. While Norfolk confirmed receipt of the alert, they maintained a perplexing stance: \"no intelligence to suggest where the group was heading,\" a claim that would ring hollow against the backdrop of the ensuing devastation. The gravest of the weekend's offenses unfolded on Friday: a young woman in her late teens, violated at a bus stop on Cadogan Road, mere steps from the seafront. Norfolk Police, in their investigation, conceded a grim possibility, linking the abhorrent act to the widespread disorder that had descended upon the town. An arrest was made, a man subsequently released under investigation, but the community's demand for justice remained largely unanswered, with no further arrests following. The pervasive fear was palpable. A BBC reporter, navigating the town on Saturday night, was met with a taxi driver's stark pronouncement: \"travellers are rampaging the town.\" The Wellington pub, a local fixture, hastily pulled down its shutters after a gathering of some 30 travellers escalated into outright \"rowdy\" behaviour, forcing staff to prioritize safety over service. Lee Sale, proprietor",
        "A blur of white, impossibly close, shot past the cockpit window of the A320 while flying south of Brookmans Park last August, leaving the pilot with a split-second, heart-stopping image of a quadcopter drone. There was no time for evasive action, no warning to react; the sudden intrusion was over before it began, a testament to pure chance that a catastrophic collision had been narrowly averted, as later confirmed by a UK Airprox Board report which concluded that \"chance had played a major part.\" The pilot's voice, laced with an undeniable tremor of adrenaline, crackled over the radio to air traffic control at approximately 18:45 BST on 15 August 2016, reporting that \"something had just gone over the top of him\" as they passed north of Potters Bar. Initially, the controller inquired about another aircraft, but the pilot's detailed, if fleeting, description painted a clearer, more alarming picture: a small object, under a metre in size, distinctly red and white with striking red and blue stripes adorning two of its rotor arms. This reckless incursion stood in stark defiance of the Air Navigation Order (ANO) 2016 articles, which explicitly mandate that all drone operators ensure their flights are conducted safely, without endangering any person or property, and crucially, maintain \"direct, unaided visual contact\" with their craft to monitor its trajectory in relation to other aircraft. The Airprox board members, in their subsequent review, unequivocally agreed that the drone had been operated at an altitude far exceeding the legal limits for unaided line-of-sight, without any",
        "The quiet truth emerged from a survey of employees and managers: a quarter of new fathers, their hearts perhaps heavy with unspoken longing, embraced no paternity leave at all, while fewer than one in ten dared to stretch beyond the brief two weeks allotted by law, those precious early days slipping by like sand through fingers. The Institute of Leadership & Management (ILM) pointed a finger at the deep-rooted, \u2018ingrained\u2019 attitudes that clung stubbornly within workplaces, alongside the gnawing worry in new fathers\u2019 minds that the cost of precious time away was simply too high a price to pay. Last year, a glimmer of hope appeared as the government unveiled plans, a blueprint for April 2015, allowing parents to share the sacred space of maternity and paternity leave. Yet, the ILM\u2019s findings cast a shadow, whispering that these legislative wings, however well-intentioned, might falter and fly low if the very air of employer attitudes remained unchanged, unyielding. Charles Elvin, ILM chief executive, hailed the forthcoming shared parental leave as a 'crucial step,' a pathway paving the way for more women to ascend to senior roles, to reach their full professional height. Still, his words carried the weight of their research, revealing how unseen 'cultural barriers' stood like silent guardians, impeding the simple uptake of even the two weeks statutory paternity leave, let alone the deeper embrace of additional time. A 'cultural expectation,' he observed, continued to echo through the corridors of organisations, a subtle yet persistent whisper that it would always be women, not men, who would step away for those extended, formative periods, cradling new life while careers paused. Moreover, the report illuminated the stark reality of low paternity pay, a cold wind blowing through the hearts of new fathers, with a mere 9% of those surveyed finding solace in more than two weeks of full pay. Frances O'Grady, secretary general of the TUC, the trade union body, resonated with this truth, stating plainly that pay was the 'major concern,' a heavy anchor. 'Many dads simply can't afford to take time off,' she lamented,",
        "The repetition of stringent conditions, particularly the singular drum beat and the newly enforced 43-meter exclusion zone for all music, underscores a persistent and increasingly constrained environment for traditional loyalist expressions, meticulously regulating their presence in what they perceive as shared civic space. This deliberate silencing, beyond the specific point of passage, appears designed to mitigate potential provocation by ensuring an absolute auditory separation from the contested site, signalling a tightening of control over cultural demonstrations. Concurrently, the commission's parallel imposition of limits on the counter-protest, restricting it to a maximum of 50 individuals across two designated locations, reveals an attempt at balanced, albeit firm, control over potential flashpoints, aiming to manage rather than fully resolve the underlying tensions. The Orange Order's immediate and unequivocal condemnation, characterising the Parades Commission as a \"mouthpiece for republican propaganda,\" starkly articulates a perception of institutional capture, where the terms of loyal order parades are dictated by opposing factions. Their denunciation of the \"invented new criteria\" of an \"earshot\" ban for a supposedly disused place of worship as both \"mischievous\" and \"absurd\" critically exposes their belief that these regulations are not neutral, but rather a deliberate and strategic act to \"further censor Protestant heritage\" and diminish their cultural visibility within the contested urban landscape. This sentiment is echoed and amplified by North Belfast MP Nigel Dodds of the DUP, who vehemently labels the commission a \"bureaucratic monstrosity\" that has either \"lost the run of itself\" or, more pointedly, \"simply dances to the tune of republican residents,\" or a \"dangerous combination of both,\" thereby challenging its impartiality and legitimacy. His palpable alarm at the commission's documented consideration of banning music even outside Clifton Street Orange hall underscores the profound sense of grievance and the perceived existential threat to loyalist cultural expression, moving beyond mere route",
        "The 34-year-old midfielder has just finished his latest spell in the Indian Super League with Atletico Kolkata. McFadden\u2019s assertion regarding the intrinsic \"appeal\" of a return to Fir Park, stemming from his own repeated history, suggests a comfort rather than necessarily a progressive career choice for veteran players like Pearson. This perceived magnetic pull might, however, mask a more complex reality, perhaps reflecting limited alternative opportunities at a certain career stage, rather than solely a deep-seated club loyalty. \"And I know Pearo is exactly the same,\" McFadden added, confirming that Well have made him an offer. Pearson began his career at Fir Park and, after spells with Celtic, Derby County, Bristol City and Karela Blasters, rejoined Well for a season in 2015. He is a free agent again after helping Kolkata finish fourth in the Indian league before winning the title with a play-off victory over his former club, Karela. \"We have spoken to him and offered him a deal and we're waiting to hear back,\" said McFadden, who thinks Motherwell have a tradition of welcoming back former players \u2013 a practice that, while fostering familiarity, can sometimes hinder the integration of fresh talent or a more forward-thinking recruitment strategy. While McFadden touts Pearson as a \"great addition\" both technically and influentially, the precise nature of this anticipated impact warrants scrutiny. The \"on the park\" contribution of a 34-year-old midfielder returning from the Indian Super League \u2013 a competition whose intensity and tactical demands differ significantly from the Scottish Premiership \u2013 raises legitimate questions about his immediate physical readiness and capacity to consistently perform at the required level. His \"off the park\" value, presumably",
        "In February of 1997, the unforgiving chill of Wick harbour yielded a tragic discovery: the lifeless body of 24-year-old Kevin Mcleod, a life abruptly extinguished. While initial pronouncements swiftly categorized his passing as accidental, his family harboured an unshakeable conviction, believing the silent testimony of his injuries spoke of a more sinister end, a truth obscured. Two decades of unyielding advocacy and persistent pleas finally prompted a re-examination, an assessment of \"all information known\" following direct contact between the Mcleod family and chief constable Phil Gormley, stirring a glimmer of hope as investigators embarked on tracing uncharted avenues of inquiry, seeking unheard voices from that fateful night. Yet, June, his mother, a figure of enduring sorrow and fierce determination, recently vowed to persist in their arduous quest for a fresh and thorough investigation should this current assessment \"turn up nothing new.\" Beyond the immediate tragedy, an additional, parallel inquiry was commissioned by the chief constable, designed to scrutinize the police's handling of the family's protracted complaints and long-held grievances regarding the initial investigation since 1997. Det Ch Supt Gareth Blair, leading major crime investigations for Police Scotland, articulated the official position, explaining the assessment was undertaken \"in recognition of the continued impact\" of Kevin's death on his parents and \"their desire for a conclusive outcome,\" extending his sympathies while clarifying this was not a full reinvestigation but \"a careful and considered analysis of a significant volume of information\" accumulated over two decades. Specialist officers meticulously sifted through this data, drawing out elusive testimonies from individuals who were in Wick that night and saw Kevin but had not previously come forward. The culmination of this review brought the devastating pronouncement to Kevin's parents on Tuesday: Blair informed them that, having carried out this assessment, there was \"no evidence of criminality\" and his death remained \"unexplained,\" leading him to determine that a full-scale reinvestigation remained unwarranted. Nevertheless, a solemn appeal echoed from Police Scotland for any latent witnesses with information about Kevin's death to come forward, promising full consideration of new and additional details, while the chief constable affirmed his separate commitment to ensure the head of professional standards would assess whether all matters and complaints raised by the family over the",
        "At the solemn Preston Crown Court, the weighty trial of Matthew Eteson unfolds, where he stands accused of the gravest charge of manslaughter by gross negligence, stemming from the tragic deaths of Kelly Webster, a vibrant 36-year-old, and her young daughter, Lauren Thornton. Their lives were cruelly cut short in April 2013, as the mother and daughter peacefully perished in their sleep aboard a boat upon the serene, yet ultimately fateful, waters of Windermere. Mr. Eteson, a 42-year-old resident of affluent Hale in Greater Manchester, vehemently denies this profoundly serious charge. What began as a joyous Easter bank holiday weekend escape to the picturesque Lake District, intended to celebrate a friend's birthday, tragically soured. Yet, on the fateful afternoon of 1 April, Mr. Eteson, according to prosecutor Mr. Graham Reeds QC, deliberately relocated the generator from its safer position on the deck, bringing it inside to power a powerful 1kW fan heater, ostensibly to warm the boat's enclosed sleeping quarter. The court heard chilling testimony that no alarm was ever raised regarding the insidious build-up of the deadly, invisible toxic gas, primarily because the crucial carbon monoxide sensors, designed to safeguard lives, had regrettably been disabled prior to the incident. Mr. Reeds described the grim discovery: the mother and daughter, both hailing from Leyland in Lancashire, were tragically found lifeless, still in their peaceful sleeping positions, aboard the second-hand Bayliner 285 motor cruiser named Arniston, their bodies containing devastatingly fatal levels of the silent killer, carbon monoxide. Mr. Eteson, despite sleeping in a separate, more distant compartment from",
        "From the heart of NHS Blood and Transplant, a vital call echoes, a plea for the crimson gift that sustains life's fragile flame. Blood group O negative, a universal embrace, stands as a beacon in emergency's darkest hour, ready to flow for any soul in need. Though a precious few, only 7% of the UK's tapestry, carry this rare essence, it answers 12% of the urgent transfusions, its demand far outweighing its quiet presence. Yet, the need deepens, a specific plea arising for B negative, a crimson thread woven through the fabric of our diverse communities. For within these groups, where life's rich heritage unfolds, the shadows of sickle cell anaemia and thalassemia often fall. These inherited burdens, where blood's very essence is misshapen or its oxygen-carrying song is muted, threaten to dim life's light, inviting an early stillness. Though only 2% of Britain's heartbeat carries this B negative type, its call has grown louder, a surge of 6% more used in recent weeks, a testament to its critical role as a bridge, a precious gift for both B negative and B positive patients, its versatility a silent strength. Donna Batty, a voice of care from donor relations, now reaches out, a heartfelt whisper across the land, asking for donors to step forward in these coming days. For the stocks of these vulnerable, life-saving groups, she reveals with a touch of tender concern, are lower than comfort allows. She implores those already pledged, whose appointments gleam on the horizon, to hold steadfast, to keep that promise made. 'We hope our fantastic donors,' she adds, 'will answer this appeal, and should the waits be a little longer, that patience's gentle grace will see them through.' Across the UK, only 4% of its pulse dedicates itself to this silent heroism. Jon Latham, guiding the outreach, yearns for a wider embrace, for 'first-time donors' to join this noble cause. 'The richer our database,' he explains, 'the easier it becomes to call upon willing hearts when a specific need arises, like tides upon the shore.' For those unsure of their",
        "The Employment and Learning minister, Dr Stephen Farry, has controversially decided to withdraw a special premium payment of \u00c2\u00a31.1m from St Mary's University College, a sum previously allocated to mitigate the inherent disadvantages of its small scale and specialist status, supporting an institution with fewer than 1,000 students and an annual income of just \u00c2\u00a34.7m. This substantial cut, compounded by broader Department of Employment and Learning (DEL) funding reductions, was initially projected by protesters to strip the college of a devastating 31% of its budget. While a recent \u00c2\u00a332m boost to the DEL's overall budget has marginally softened the blow, the college still anticipates a crippling 26.5% reduction, a figure deemed \"far too challenging\" by Principal Prof Peter Finn, implying an unsustainable operational environment. Prof Finn vehemently accuses Stephen Farry of a blatantly opportunistic maneuver, leveraging financial duress to coerce St Mary's into accepting one of the Minister's predetermined \"solutions\" for the future of teacher training in Northern Ireland, none of which preserve the college's cherished autonomy. Despite the institution's stated determination to safeguard its distinct character and Catholic ethos, Prof Finn has paradoxically expressed openness to \"very deep sharing\" among teacher training institutions, potentially involving inter-college student placements, suggesting a nuanced willingness to collaborate without compromising core identity. A central point of contention for Prof Finn is the Minister's justification for removing the premia, predicated on their supposed unique existence in Northern Ireland; he critically highlights that while similar payments were indeed abolished in England, those institutions were simultaneously granted compensatory freedoms, including the ability to charge significantly higher tuition fees and remove student number caps \u2013 vital financial levers conspicuously denied to St Mary's, thus creating an inequitable playing field. This systemic financial pressure is not isolated, as Stranmillis University College, which primarily trains teachers for non-Catholic schools, faces analogous challenges and has been engaged in protracted, yet still unapproved, merger negotiations with Queen's University since 2008, underscoring the wider, contentious restructuring efforts impacting the entire teacher training sector.",
        "The Welsh government's strategic injection of nearly \u00a315m underpins a significant investment poised to ignite production in late 2018. This crucial backing, championed by Economy Minister Edwina Hart, is heralded as a bulwark against economic uncertainty, set to \"safeguard more than 750 skilled Welsh jobs for many years.\" Hart's declaration underscores the relentless international competition, revealing a proactive governmental effort to secure a vital share of this investment for Wales. Ford's decision to anchor its new innovative engine manufacturing here is not merely a corporate choice but a resounding affirmation of the local management team's unwavering reputation and the Welsh workforce's celebrated quality and steadfast loyalty.\n\nSince its inception in 1980, the Ford Bridgend plant has navigated a landscape of fierce global contention, consistently battling to win successive investments that have collectively exceeded \u00a32.8bn. Beyond the 1,860 direct employees at the plant, Ford's enduring presence is a pillar for approximately 10,000 jobs across south Wales, illustrating its profound regional economic footprint. The genesis of this new fuel-efficient engine range is a testament to collaborative innovation, with design and development meticulously undertaken by technicians spanning Ford's facilities in Essex and Germany. Yet, securing this pivotal investment demanded concessions; a candid letter from Ford to its workers, revealed by the BBC in June, outlined the imperative for revised working conditions at Bridgend, essential to elevate the plant's competitive edge.\n\nThis announcement resonated as a beacon of hope, particularly for Bridgend's workforce. Welsh Conservative shadow economy minister William Graham interpreted it as a tangible sign of \"confidence in the UK government's efforts to rebuild the economy.\" The timing is serendipitous: new production is slated to commence in 2018, precisely as the manufacturing of Jaguar Land Rover engines at the site draws to a close, effectively averting a looming crisis and securing hundreds of jobs that might otherwise have been imperiled. This positive trajectory, however, follows a recent downturn, with 200 fixed-contract workers having been released earlier this year upon the cessation of Volvo engine manufacturing. Lingering concerns persist regarding the new investment's potential to constrain Bridgend's output, potentially reducing its manufacturing capacity to just one-third of current levels. Furthermore, questions have arisen concerning the Welsh government's \u00a315m contribution to a multinational corporation for a plant it owns",
        "The financial bedrock of S4C, deeply reliant on the public's licence fee contributions, now finds its future intricately woven into the expansive, critical review announced by UK ministers concerning the BBC. This pivotal moment prompted Monmouth MP David Davies to articulate a potent defence, asserting to BBC Wales that S4C stands as a \"special case\" by virtue of its fundamental, irreplaceable role in promoting the Welsh language. Yet, this cultural imperative clashes with ministerial directives pressing S4C towards cost efficiencies akin to those demanded of the BBC. Labour's stark warning emerged as a shadow over these discussions, highlighting the perilous link between proposed BBC budget reductions and the existential threat they posed to S4C's operations. Despite these anxieties, Culture Secretary John Whittingdale offered a tempered assurance to MPs, affirming a commitment to the channel \"within the next couple of years,\" while simultaneously expressing a desire for imminent discussions with S4C's leadership. Davies, elaborating on BBC Radio Cymru's Rhaglen Dylan Jones, further underscored the government's recognition of S4C's profound significance, describing it as \"more than a station\"\u2014a vital bulwark for the very future of the Welsh language. He intriguingly hinted at the possibility of the Welsh Affairs Committee, which he chairs, launching an inquiry into broadcasting, specifically encompassing S4C, reiterating his personal conviction: \"I believe S4C to be a special case as it promotes the Welsh language and I believe it to be more important that S4C carries on more than any other BBC channel,\" thus articulating a singular devotion to its survival above other BBC entities. S4C, for its part, having already navigated \"substantial cuts\" since 2010, intends to foreground the \"uniqueness\" of its",
        "The latest Markit Report on Jobs for Scotland revealed a compelling surge in permanent and temporary job placements in April, painting a vibrant picture of the nation's economic pulse. Indeed, the growth in temporary staff demand reached an almost forgotten high, touching levels not seen in nearly a decade, a testament to evolving employment strategies. However, this otherwise buoyant success story was shadowed by a stark reality: recruiters voiced growing concern as declining candidate availability cast a looming threat over future prosperity, with employers increasingly struggling to bring in the precise skills they so desperately need. In a prescient warning, the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) underscored a crucial imperative: whichever party ultimately forms a government after the general election on 8 June must, without fail, safeguard essential access to the vital workers the country undeniably needs from abroad, alongside a robust commitment to investing profoundly in UK jobseekers. The intricate jobs report further elucidated a deeply encouraging trend, revealing that growth in permanent appointments maintained its sustained momentum for the third consecutive month in April, marking the fastest rate of expansion witnessed in a remarkable 21 months. This momentum offered a striking divergence, contrasting sharply with a more subdued slowdown recorded across the UK as a whole, highlighting Scotland's unique resilience. Concurrently, an undeniable burst of activity saw a sharp increase in temporary placements \u2013 the steepest surge since August 2014, reflecting a strategic reliance on flexible staffing. Yet, this positive dynamic was tempered by a growing chasm: the availability of workers regrettably fell further in April, registering the sharpest drop in the availability of permanent staff in nine months, a palpable scarcity. Meanwhile, the availability of Scottish temporary candidates also alarmingly declined at the quickest pace observed in nearly two years, signalling a tightening squeeze on the labour pool. Unsurprisingly, the IT and computing, nursing/medical/care, and hotel and catering sectors emerged as critical arteries, witnessing the highest growth in demand for permanent staff, while nursing/medical/care, IT and computing, and engineering and construction bravely led the way for temporary staff, reflecting urgent and evolving societal needs. The report also delivered a welcome boon, finding that average salaries for permanent starters in Scotland rose sharply in April, offering a tangible reward for skilled professionals, while the rate at which temporary pay increased across Scotland was the fastest recorded for a full year, a clear indicator of escalating market pressure.

        "Envoy Sigrid Kaag, her pronouncements carrying the weight of the international community, spoke with palpable urgency as Syria reportedly failed to meet a critical Sunday deadline for the removal of its deadly arsenal. The global expectation remained fixed on the ultimate destruction of all Syria's declared chemical weapons by the immutable date of 30 June. This monumental task, a fragile agreement forged in the crucible of despair, stemmed from a Russian-US deal meticulously drawn up last year in the horrific aftermath of a sarin rocket attack that claimed hundreds of lives on the outskirts of Damascus, leaving an indelible stain of terror. The vast, complex multinational mission dedicated to purging the country of these weapons of mass destruction is meticulously overseen by the august bodies of the UN Security Council and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). While the overarching UN deadline for the complete obliteration of Syria's chemical weapons loomed on 30 June, Damascus had earlier pledged, with a sincerity now questioned by repeated delays, to finalize the removal of its entire stockpile by 27 April.\n\n\"The overwhelming bulk of the chemical weapons material has been painstakingly removed from its original locations, yet it remains undestroyed, a critical step still pending towards the 30 June deadline,\" Ms. Kaag, the resolute head of the OPCW-UN Joint Mission, conveyed to the BBC, her words underscoring the precariousness of the situation. \"That's precisely why it is so profoundly important to secure the remaining vestiges of the chemical weapons material, which still resides perilously in a single, crucial site.\" Her statement also highlighted the UN's deepening concern regarding recent, disturbing allegations that Syrian forces had deployed chlorine gas as a weapon, a chilling development that threatens to unravel the delicate peace. Chlorine, notably, was not among the prohibited substances explicitly covered by the intricate deal, a diplomatic lifeline widely",
        "Media playback is not supported on this device. The Seattle Reign player, Kim Little, topped a supporters' poll to become the second winner of the BBC World Service award, a mechanism that, while celebrating individual achievement, inherently privileges popularity and established fan bases in its selection process. She outmaneuvered a formidable shortlist comprising Gaelle Enganamouit (FC Rosengard, Sweden), Amandine Henry (Olympique Lyonnais), Carli Lloyd (Houston Dash), and Becky Sauerbrunn (FC Kansas City), an impressive roster that nonetheless represents a narrow, albeit strong, slice of global talent. Little, 25, expressed a predictable modesty, stating, \"I'm surprised to win, I'm extremely humbled to win,\" before offering an optimistic, if perhaps rose-tinted, assessment that \"Women's football is in a great place. Hopefully it will progress further,\" a sentiment that implicitly acknowledges the persistent disparities and challenges still facing the sport despite its recent strides. Little received the award at her club's training ground on Tuesday. Mary Hockaday, Controller of BBC World Service English, lauded the win, proclaiming, \"Well done to Kim Little. It's been another outstanding year for women's football and Kim's talent shines through on the pitch.\" Hockaday added a self-congratulatory note, \"I'm delighted BBC World Service plays an important part in giving female footballers the recognition they deserve,\" a claim that invites scrutiny regarding the BBC's broader, and historically less robust, commitment to consistent, in-depth coverage beyond annual accolades. Little's on-field prowess is undeniable; she was Seattle's leading scorer and second overall in America's National Women's Soccer League with 10 goals, instrumental in the Reign's 2015 league-topping performance, and also undertook a loan spell at Melbourne City in the same year. The former Hibernian and Arsenal Ladies star \u2014 a five-time title winner with the Gunners \u2014 boasts 115 appearances for Scotland, scoring 46 goals, and notably contributed to Great Britain reaching the quarter-finals at the",
        "The opening round of the Olympic golf tournament witnessed an exceptional performance from Fraser, the world number 90, whose nine birdies culminated in an eight-under-par 63, establishing a three-shot lead over the competitive field. This notable achievement occurred within a context significantly shaped by the withdrawal of more than half of the men's world top 10 players from the Rio 2016 Games, primarily citing concerns over the Zika virus; these absences have invariably influenced the perceived prestige and competitive landscape of the event. Amidst this backdrop, Briton Justin Rose, currently positioned in a group on four under, etched his name into Olympic history by executing the first-ever hole-in-one on the par-three fourth. Rose articulated the profound significance of this unique accomplishment, stating, \"There is always an element of luck but you could chalk it up as a good hole-in-one... When you are the first to do something no one can take that away from you. That was definitely a cool moment,\" thereby emphasizing the indelible nature of pioneering feats in elite sport. The leaderboard further revealed a compelling international mix, with newly crowned Open champion Henrik Stenson tied for second alongside Canada's Graham Delaet at five under, while Rose occupied a shared fourth position at four under with Belgium's Thomas Pieters, Gregory Bourdy of France, Alex Cejka of Germany, and Spain's Rafael Cabrera Bello. Conversely, Danny Willett, the first British Masters winner in two decades, concluded his round at level par with a 71. The second round is scheduled to commence on Friday at 11:30 BST, notably without a halfway cut, a structural characteristic attributable to the limited field",
        "The historical rugby match between England and Scotland, contested on 30 January 1915, was a unique philanthropic endeavour organised by Edgar Mobbs, a distinguished former England international and captain of Northampton Saints. This event was strategically conceived to leverage Mobbs's public profile and the appeal of sport to recruit servicemen for his World War One battalion. A century later, a commemorative match is scheduled for 24 January 2015 at Olney Rugby Club, featuring players from the East Midlands region competing against The 1st Battalion of the Yorkshire Regiment, while the Olney Ladies will challenge the Army Women's XV. Edgar Mobbs, born in Northampton in 1882, initiated his illustrious rugby career in Olney before ascending to the captaincy of Northampton Rugby Football Club in 1907. His national prominence was cemented in 1909 when he was selected for England, scoring a try on his debut against Australia and subsequently earning seven caps. Despite retiring from rugby in 1913 at the age of 30, Mobbs's initial application for an officer's commission was rejected due to his age when war broke out; undeterred, he enlisted as a private. His exceptional leadership and bravery saw him rapidly promoted from private to battalion commander, participating in significant engagements including Loos, Somme, Arras, and Messines. Recognised for his distinguished service, he was twice Mentioned in Despatches and awarded the Distinguished Service Order, ultimately making the supreme sacrifice while leading a charge against a German machine gun during the Battle of Passchendaele on 31 July 1917. Mobbs actively engaged in recruitment efforts, famously addressing a large crowd at a Northampton Saints game, an address credited with persuading over 200 men to enlist. The 1915 international match is widely acknowledged to have significantly inspired hundreds more to join his personal corps, the \"Sportsman's Battalion,\" which subsequently formed a substantial component of the 7th Battalion of the Northamptonshire Regiment. This recruitment came at a considerable cost, with 16 Olney players among those who perished during the conflict. The enduring legacy of Edgar Mobbs is underscored by the planned attendance of his family, including his great-nephew, also named Edgar Mobbs, at the forthcoming commemorative game. Reflecting",
        "A significant reform in the stewardship of national cultural assets is underway, with a newly established charity designated to oversee the National Heritage Collection. This extensive collection, encompassing pivotal historical and cultural landmarks such as Stonehenge, Dover Castle, London's Kenwood House, and Charles Darwin's former residence in Kent, represents a diverse array of sites critical to the nation's identity and historical narrative. Currently supported by an annual government contribution of \u00a322m, the long-term objective is for this charity to achieve complete financial self-sufficiency. This transition entails a phased reduction of government funding, commencing in 2015 and culminating in its complete cessation, thereby granting the organization enhanced autonomy to cultivate diversified revenue streams through commercial ventures and philanthropic endowments. An initial investment of \u00a380m from the government has been allocated to facilitate the establishment of the charity, ensuring its full operational capability by March 2015. Crucially, this restructuring delineates distinct responsibilities: while the charity, retaining the established name English Heritage, will focus on the operational management and income generation from the sites, governmental oversight for regulatory functions, such as the listing of historically significant buildings and advisory roles in planning, will be consolidated within a new official entity, provisionally named the National Heritage Protection Service. A fundamental principle underpinning these reforms is that the 420 sites comprising the National Heritage Collection will unequivocally remain under public ownership, safeguarding their accessibility and public benefit despite the shift in operational management. The government agency involved has publicly characterized these proposed changes, which are subject to a forthcoming consultation process, as an \"excellent outcome.\" This initiative is framed as a forward-looking strategy for the next century of heritage preservation, building upon a century of state protection. The substantial \u00a380m investment and the establishment of the new charity are",
        "Christopher Kelly, 40, in a moment of unimaginable fury, strangled his friend Dorothy Beattie, 51, at her home in Dunoon, Argyll and Bute, on May 22. The High Court in Glasgow heard how this terrible act unfolded after she allegedly made a cutting jibe about his children, a perceived slight that clearly ignited a raw and devastating anger within him. He was eventually caught, not by an external pursuit, but by the unbearable weight of his own conscience, confessing the horror to a GP days later. Though originally charged with murder, he pleaded guilty to the lesser, yet still profoundly sorrowful, charge of culpable homicide. The court learned of a prior connection, Kelly having once been a support worker for Ms Beattie, a woman grappling with numerous medical conditions, including seizures, a history that deepened the tragic irony of their later friendship. This bond, forged in care and evolving into companionship, where they often socialised together, made the subsequent betrayal and violence all the more poignant. The social care graduate, whose profession was built on empathy, attacked her in her own home, however, after those alleged \"derogatory\" remarks about his children, a verbal wound that seemed to snap something fundamental within him. Kelly, in a sudden, violent surge, grabbed Ms Beattie and strangled her, then fled the flat, leaving behind the unthinkable. The immediate aftermath was one of chilling panic and a desperate, futile attempt to erase the moment; he later returned, and upon finding her lifeless, sat with her body in a grim vigil before moving it to her bed, a final, desperate act of a distorted kindness before his escape. The court was told how Kelly's flight was marked by a further violation, taking a train to Edinburgh after using Ms Beattie's bank card to steal \u00a3300 from his victim's account, a cold, calculated act amidst the chaos of his mind. The grim discovery fell to her daughter, on May 25, after her own mounting, unanswered calls had turned to dread. Kelly, meanwhile, endured days of agonizing, tortured anonymity, sleeping rough in Edinburgh until May 28, when the internal pressure became too",
        "A journey from Penzance to Exeter, typically a ribbon of serene passage through the English countryside, was violently interrupted when one train, brimming with unsuspecting souls, slammed into another at platform six just after 15.30 BST on 3 April. The initial findings from the Rail Accident Investigation Branch painted a disquieting picture, revealing the signaller's fateful belief that adequate space remained for both colossal machines on the platform \u2013 a miscalculation that would soon echo with the cries of the injured. This single, terrible misjudgment, born perhaps of a fleeting distraction or a trust in the familiar, would shatter the afternoon calm for about 35 people, their lives irrevocably altered by the sudden, jarring halt. The report, a stark recounting of what went wrong, clarified that \"permissive working,\" the practice of allowing trains to share a platform, was indeed permitted for passenger trains using platform six. Yet, what was allowed on paper betrayed the reality on the ground; the signaller, peering from the signal box window, had visually estimated enough room for the incoming train, but his eyes, tragically, deceived him. The rear of the stationary train, it turned out, occupied more space than his hurried glance had allowed for. A seemingly innocuous decision, moving one of the trains to platform six due to closed passenger lifts for maintenance on alternative platforms, set in motion this devastating chain of events, an unfortunate confluence of minor inconveniences culminating in catastrophe. As the moving train approached Plymouth, accelerating to about 21 mph and navigating a relatively",
        "The incumbent, a 71-year-old, secured a substantial mandate, reportedly garnering 60.75% of the ballots cast, according to the official pronouncements of the election commission; his primary challenger, Kizza Besigye, trailed significantly with 35% of the vote. Proponents of the incumbent articulated that the opposition's platforms lacked substantive proposals for national advancement, thereby failing to present a compelling alternative vision for the nation's trajectory. Conversely, Mr. Besigye, confined under house arrest at the time of the announcement, vehemently denounced the official results as a \"sham,\" issuing an urgent appeal to the international community for their outright rejection. In a subsequent statement, he asserted that the nation had \"just witnessed what must be the most fraudulent electoral process in Uganda,\" underscoring his profound skepticism regarding the poll's integrity. Independent assessments from the European Union observer mission corroborated these concerns, specifically criticizing the ruling party for fostering an \"intimidating atmosphere\" throughout the electoral period, observations further compounded by persistent allegations from the opposition concerning systemic vote rigging. While acknowledging the \"remarkable determination\" demonstrated by Ugandan citizens in exercising their franchise, Eduard Kukan, the EU Chief Observer, crucially noted that the incumbent National Resistance Movement's \"domination of the political landscape distorted the fairness of the campaign,\" implying an uneven playing field that compromised democratic principles. Further contributing to the contentious nature of the election were reports of sporadic violence, widespread allegations of electoral fraud by the opposition, and the strategic blocking of social media platforms and messaging applications, which significantly hindered communication and transparency. The pre-emptive detention of Mr. Besigye under house arrest on Friday, justified",
        "The promise of economic revitalization hangs heavy over Chippenham, as a prominent retailer champions plans for a sprawling development, pledging a substantial influx of 1,000 new jobs and an annual economic injection of \u00a331 million. These figures, dangled as a beacon of prosperity, have undeniably ignited fervent debate across the constituency. Yet, this vision of progress is met with a deeply divided chorus from the five hopefuls vying for the area's parliamentary seat; while one candidate stands resolutely opposed, a significant three articulate profound reservations, particularly concerning the proposed location. The very soul of the town seems to be under contention, evidenced by the thousands of local residents who have affixed their signatures to petitions, both passionately advocating for and fiercely resisting the ambitious scheme. Conservative contender Michelle Donelan, acknowledging the inherent dichotomy, professes an understanding of both the potential benefits and the inherent risks. Her primary concern, however, crystallizes around the recently concluded consultation process, which she vehemently deems \"inadequate\" for a project poised to \"dramatically change the town forever\"\u2014an irreversible reshaping of Chippenham's character. The fate of this colossal 72,000 sq m regional centre application still awaits the scrutiny and deliberation of Wiltshire Council. However, the pre-election spotlight of a BBC Wiltshire debate provided the quintet of candidates a crucial platform to air their divergent perspectives.

        "The 31-year-old artist reported an alleged incident where she was denied service by a black cab driver, who purportedly directed her to \"find an immigrant\" for transportation. This reported altercation occurred shortly after her public apology \"on behalf of my country\" regarding the squalid conditions observed at the \"Jungle\" camp in Calais. In response, the Licensed Taxi Drivers' Association (LTDA) issued a statement condemning such abusive behaviour, emphasizing the professional standards expected of its members. The singer detailed the encounter on Twitter, quoting the driver's derogatory remarks and reflecting on how this interaction offered her a \"tiny glimpse\" into the experience of discrimination, despite her acknowledged life of privilege. Her account, however, faced immediate scrutiny from some social media users, who questioned its veracity and demanded photographic evidence or the taxi's registration plate. The artist retorted by accusing them of \"victim shaming,\" explaining that her hands were occupied with her children, preventing her from quickly accessing her phone to document the incident. The LTDA, representing approximately 5,500 black cab drivers in London, subsequently urged Transport for London (TfL) to launch an investigation into the pop star's claims. General secretary Steve McNamara articulated the association's position, stating that while the driver's membership status was unconfirmed, such allegations are treated with extreme seriousness, and any cabbie exhibiting such disrespectful and abusive language would be condemned. McNamara further highlighted that such \"appalling behaviour\" could jeopardise the driver's licence. This incident is contextualised by Allen's earlier emotional visit to the Calais camp, where she met 13-year-old Afghan refugee Shamsher Sherin. During a BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme segment, Allen became visibly distressed while discussing Sherin's two-month wait to be reunited with his father in Birmingham, a reunion that occurred approximately a week later. In a poignant exchange, Allen expressed profound regret, telling Sherin: \"It just seems that at three different intervals in this young boy's life, the English in particular have put you in danger. We've bombed your country, put you in the hands of the Taliban and now put you in danger of risking your life to get into our country. I apologise on behalf of my country. I'm sorry for what we have put you through.\" This public act of contrition for perceived national",
        "The transfer fee for the 25-year-old Argentine World Cup runner-up, Federico Fernandez, remains officially undisclosed, though reports indicate a figure approaching \u00a38 million. Fernandez has signed a four-year contract with the club and is anticipated to be available for selection in Swansea's squad for the upcoming match against Burnley on Saturday, pending the finalization of international clearance. His significant international experience includes starting in four of Argentina's matches during their progression to the World Cup final. Fernandez's arrival is a direct response to manager Garry Monk's strategic move to bolster the defensive line, following the departure of 27-year-old Chico Flores to Qatar. The central defender expressed considerable satisfaction regarding his move to the Swans, articulating that playing in the Premier League, which he considers the world's premier league, has long been an aspiration, and he is appreciative of Swansea for providing this opportunity. Prior to his commitment, he consulted with former teammates Michu and Jordi Amat; his association with Michu dates back to their time at Napoli, and he also connected with Alvaro Vazquez during a loan spell at Getafe in 2013, who is a close acquaintance of Jordi Amat. Michu conveyed that Swansea is characterized as a \"family club\" within a \"very relaxed\" city, describing it as a \"very good club\" and reinforcing the positive sentiment he had already gathered. Swansea City is scheduled to host their inaugural home Premier League fixture against Burnley on Saturday, August 23rd, building on their recent 2-1 victory away at Manchester United in their opening match of the season. Due to his recent return to training following his involvement in the World Cup, his immediate readiness for the upcoming match remains uncertain. Manager Garry Monk affirmed that Fernandez, who completed 13 appearances during a loan spell at Spanish club Getafe last season, represents a valuable acquisition for the club. Monk highlighted Fernandez's distinguished pedigree, citing his experience playing at the highest level for Napoli and representing Argentina in the World Cup. He further emphasized the player's favorable age, physical attributes, and technical proficiency, asserting that Fernandez is a \"very good footballer\" whose style is well-suited to Swansea City, embodying the type of player the club seeks to identify to unequivocally enhance the overall quality of the squad.",
        "New CCTV footage, depicting 14-year-old Charlene Downes, who was last seen in Blackpool town centre, has been uncovered during a recent re-examination of archival material in connection with her disappearance. Charlene's body has never been located since she vanished on November 1, 2003. Her mother, Karen Downes, expressed profound \"disgust\" that this critical footage had only surfaced now, after years of intensive investigation into her daughter's unsolved murder. Lancashire Police acknowledged and stated they \"understood\" Ms. Downes' perspective regarding the significant delay. To date, no individual has been successfully convicted in connection with Charlene's death. The newly discovered footage was made public on the anniversary of Charlene's disappearance, forming a crucial part of what is now recognized as one of the force's longest-running murder investigations. Ms. Downes articulated her frustration, questioning why the footage had eluded previous investigative efforts, describing this oversight as \"absolutely disgusting.\" Concurrently, she conveyed a sense of hope, expressing satisfaction with the release of the images and the potential for detectives to advance the case, ultimately seeking \"closure\" for her family, whose lives have been irrevocably impacted by the unresolved tragedy. Det Ch Insp Richard McCutcheon confirmed the images were only recently found, explaining this as the reason for their immediate publication. The footage captures Charlene alongside her sister, Rebecca, on Bank Hey Street at approximately 15:25 GMT on November 1, 2003, as they walked towards the Coral Island amusement arcade. While Charlene subsequently returned home, she later ventured back to Blackpool town centre that same evening, marking the last confirmed sighting of her. Police have confirmed that the clothing she is seen wearing in the footage matches the description of her attire when she disappeared. Det Supt Andy Webster indicated that current police efforts are focusing on potential links between Charlene's disappearance and the broader issue of child sexual exploitation within the Blackpool area. He further stated that investigators have identified several individuals who could be either victims or offenders, with intentions to make arrests and prosecute abusers in the near future. The case has a complex legal history; a man previously accused of Charlene's murder was acquitted by a judge in 2008, following the emergence of \"grave doubts\" regarding evidence presented during his second trial. The jury in his initial trial had been unable to",
        "Julia Knight, a 56-year-old defendant, stands accused of grave offenses, specifically denying the attempted murder of Irene Robson, aged 81, at Horton Hospital in Banbury during October 2014. While she admits to the act of administering insulin, a substance of considerable potency, she informed a jury at Oxford Crown Court that her motivation stemmed from a desire to prevent her own discharge from the medical facility. Furthermore, Ms Knight refutes a second charge of causing grievous bodily harm with intent, asserting to the court that her primary objective was to ensure her mother remained under professional care and was not sent home prematurely. Expressing profound regret, she testified, \"I felt terrible because I knew I was going to make mum unwell. It was a stupid, stupid, thing to do. If I could go back and change it, I would.\" She candidly admitted to fabricating a series of untruths when questioned by police in January, and the court heard evidence that she had indeed forged a prescription for insulin, subsequently collecting the illicitly obtained medication from a Sainsbury's store in Banbury. When pressed by defence barrister Simon Mayo QC regarding her initial insistence to officers that she had not injected her mother, Ms Knight explained, \"I realised it was serious. I was ashamed of what I had done.\" However, prosecutor John Price QC vehemently contended that Ms Knight's actions constituted an intention to administer a lethal dose to Ms Robson before departing the Horton. He posed a challenging question to the defendant: \"Why did you inject your mother with a substance which for all you knew could kill her within five minutes and do nothing for an hour and twenty minutes?\" Ms Knight unequivocally responded, \"I never intended my mother to",
        "So, picture this: the Korea Space Launch Vehicle-1, or KSLV-1 as it's known, just absolutely blasted off from the Naro Space Center. We're talking 4 PM local time, which was 7 AM GMT. And here's the good news: Science Minister Lee Ju-ho quickly confirmed that the satellite, designed to gather crucial climate data, had successfully reached its intended orbit \u2013 a huge sigh of relief, I'm sure. Now, it's important to remember the context here. This launch happened just weeks after North Korea, their northern neighbor, had successfully put its *own* satellite into orbit using a three-stage rocket, and that, as you might recall, really sparked a firestorm of international criticism. This impressive piece of engineering, South Korea's 140-tonne rocket, affectionately called Naro, was actually a collaborative effort, built in partnership with Russia, who had committed to working with Seoul for a total of three launch attempts. This wasn't an easy road, though. Previous attempts, back in 2009 and 2010, unfortunately ended in failure. And even this very launch had faced its own challenges, having to be postponed not once, but twice, all due to various technical glitches. But despite those setbacks, officials were absolutely beaming. They confirmed that Wednesday's launch, from the Naro site about 480 kilometers south of Seoul, went off without a hitch. The rocket, they said, had reached its precise target altitude and successfully deployed its precious satellite. Minister Lee, speaking to reporters, was clear and concise: \"After analyzing various data,\" he stated, \"the Naro rocket successfully put the science satellite into designated orbit.\" He even gave us a precise timeline, noting that the satellite had detached a mere 540 seconds, or about nine minutes, after that initial liftoff. And he didn't stop there. With immense pride, he declared, \"We now have leapt up a step to become a space-power nation!\" He really emphasized that South Korea intends to harness this \"overwhelming moment\" \u2013 this incredible achievement \u2013 as a \"strong, dynamic force\" to truly propel forward their own independent space program. The satellite itself, officially named Science and Technology Satellite-2C, has a vital mission: it's designed to diligently collect critical climate data, helping us better understand our planet.

        "The club chairman, Assem Allam, had issued a definitive ultimatum, declaring his intention to divest his ownership of the Premier League club within a mere 24 hours should his proposed name change, from Hull City to Hull Tigers, be rejected. This rejection was indeed confirmed by the Football Association in April, precipitating the current situation. \"When I say something, I mean it,\" the 75-year-old Egyptian industrialist asserted on Thursday, further clarifying that the club had been formally placed on the market precisely 22 hours after the FA's decision five months prior. Mr. Allam confirmed that an official appeal against the Football Association's rejection of the name change was being formally submitted to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. He reiterated his earlier assertion from the year that the club would be placed on the market if their strategic endeavour to establish \"Hull Tigers\" as a globally recognised brand and playing name encountered obstruction. \"As a consequence of the FA decision on 9 April, I announced on 10 April, within 22 hours, that Hull City is for sale,\" he stated, underscoring the swift execution of his previously declared intentions. Allam, who assumed control of the club in December 2010, was pressed on his course of action should a suitable buyer not materialise and the legal appeal be ultimately dismissed. \"I will give it away. Out means I'm out. Have I ever said anything and gone back on it?\" he responded unequivocally. Despite this, Allam affirmed that he and his son Ehab, who serves as the club's acting chief executive, would maintain their commitment to the club for the interim period. \"If the appeal comes first, ok, no harm done. If the sale comes first - sold,\" he remarked, outlining the potential outcomes. He remained somewhat circumspect regarding the extent of interest from potential purchasers but indicated a conditional willingness to remain involved should the appeal prove successful. While acknowledging the paramount need for stability within the squad for manager Steve Bruce and his players, the chairman underscored his substantial",
        "Nineteen-year-old Scot Higgins, whose formative football years were meticulously cultivated within Celtic's renowned academy system, now embarks on a new chapter at Rugby Park following a brief but impactful four-appearance loan spell at Dens Park with Dundee last season. Joining him is the more experienced Alan Power, a 29-year-old former Republic of Ireland Under-21 international, who departs English League Two club Lincoln City as a veritable club legend, having commanded their midfield through over 250 league encounters, famously captaining them during their remarkable FA Cup quarter-final journey. Both players have committed their immediate futures to the Kilmarnock cause, signing two-year contracts, with Power's anticipated arrival awaiting final clearance. Higgins articulated a palpable enthusiasm for his new surroundings, telling Kilmarnock's official website, \"It feels good to be here, as it's a club that's definitely going in the right direction,\" echoing a collective sentiment. Manager Lee McCulloch underscored Higgins' perfect alignment with Kilmarnock's developmental ethos, stating, \"He came through Celtic's academy, which has seen many impressive young players come through. For the second half of last season he gained valuable experience at Dundee and through time will only get better, which is only a good thing for this club.\" Power, in turn, expressed his eagerness to immerse himself in the club's rich heritage: \"I've heard a lot about the town and the club's history and I can't wait to get started. The manager spoke about his visions for this club and it was an easy decision to make.\" McCulloch, who meticulously followed Lincoln's FA Cup exploits, praised Power's",
        "England's back row has been severely depleted, a cruel twist of fate sidelining James Haskell, Sam Jones, and Mike Williams, alongside the crucial versatility of Maro Itoje. Yet, amidst this challenge, the narrative of Harrison emerges, a player whose brief, ill-fated half-hour against Australia in Sydney now seems a distant memory. Eddie Jones, with a tone of quiet conviction, revealed the unseen hours of toil: \"He's gone back and worked on his game very hard,\" the coach told BBC Sport, adding that Harrison's last game against Castres was \"exceptional\" and he is \"probably our number one choice open-side flanker at the moment,\" a ringing endorsement of a player reborn. Meanwhile, a narrative of perseverance unfolds with the recall of flanker Tom Wood, whom Jones suggests now stands on the precipice of selection this autumn. Once dismissed with the blunt assessment of \"distinctly average\" performances post-Rugby World Cup, Wood has manifestly transformed. Jones lauded his \"improved work-rate, his impact as a ball carrier,\" asserting he is \"certainly above average now.\" His refined lineout skills and enhanced breakdown efficacy have evidently caught the coach's discerning eye. \"We are excited about him being in the squad,\" Jones affirmed, highlighting his lineout prowess as a \"great chance\" for autumn selection. Six fresh faces, untried in the unforgiving arena of international Test rugby, swell the 33-man squad, yet Jones tempers expectations with strategic realism. A debut against the Springboks on November 12th, he sagely cautioned, is \"probably not the right game to make your debut,\" hinting at a more gradual integration into the national fold.

        "This is quite a striking situation, isn't it? We're seeing these accounts pop up, essentially co-opting the names and, you could say, the very authority of respected government bodies like NASA and the Environmental Protection Agency. And what are they doing? They're directly taking on the president, especially on this really contentious issue where Mr. Trump has famously, or perhaps infamously, depending on your view, called climate change a complete hoax. Take @RogueNASA, for instance. They're not subtle about it. They've explicitly declared themselves the \"unofficial 'Resistance' team of NASA.\" And they lay out their mission statement right there in their bio, practically shouting, \"Look, we're not an official NASA account, and government employees aren't running this show.\" But they invite you in, saying, \"Come for the facts, stay for the snark.\" It's quite a blend, isn't it? Serious science with a side of sharp commentary. Now, BBC News actually reached out to one of these, the rogue Environmental Protection Agency account, @ActualEPAFacts. And what they told us was pretty telling. They said their whole purpose, their very reason for being, was to ensure that \"factual information about climate change and other scientific research continues to be shared during the Trump administration.\" It's like they felt a real vacuum, a real need. And get this: they claimed to be three actual EPA employees. Their motivation? They said they jumped into action *after* a gagging order came down, essentially stopping them from doing any interviews about their own research. It paints a picture, doesn't it, of dedicated scientists feeling silenced? And this all gels with what media reports have been suggesting, that the Trump administration was, in fact, trying to put a pretty tight lid on how certain government agencies \u2013 and the EPA was definitely one of them \u2013 communicated with the public. You can even see a sort of stark evidence of this: the official EPA Twitter account, usually quite active, hasn't posted a single thing since January 19th. That's the day before Mr. Trump's inauguration. It's like a sudden, digital silence fell. What's fascinating is the sheer reach these accounts are having. @ActualEPAFacts, for example, told us they were genuinely taken aback by the explosion in their follower count \u2013 we're talking over 90,000 people now. But they also admitted feeling pretty exposed, which is understandable given the nature of their actions. And they're not alone. The other rogue accounts are racking up massive numbers too. @RogueNASA, with just a handful of tweets over a few days, already has",
        "A comprehensive report from British Marine, the authoritative voice representing the vast and intricate tapestry of the UK's marine sector \u2013 encompassing everything from exhilarating leisure craft and opulent superyachts to the sturdy vessels of small commercial enterprises \u2013 unveiled a gleaming figure: superyacht revenues alone for the year culminating in April 2016 had majestically swelled to \u00a3605m, a testament to the enduring allure of luxury on the waves. Across the entire expansive sector, total revenues experienced a steady ascent of 1.6%, cresting at an impressive \u00a33.01bn. This significant achievement marked the first time this formidable \u00a33bn threshold had been confidently breached since the pre-crisis era of 2008-2009, signalling a robust resurgence. Yet, a note of caution tempered this optimism, as the report presciently predicted a deceleration in growth throughout 2017. The looming shadow of uncertainty cast by the ongoing Brexit negotiations, it warned, was poised to dampen enthusiasm and likely curb the burgeoning demand. Total revenue had previously plunged dramatically in the turbulent wake of the global financial crisis, reaching its nadir in the financial year 2011-2012 at a stark \u00a32.85bn, but had since been gradually, albeit persistently, picking up momentum. This welcome sales increase was largely attributed to a surge in revenue from the manufacturing of sophisticated engines and essential marine equipment, alongside a noticeable jump in the sales of versatile hire and charter boats. While exports for the year saw a marginal dip of 0.7% to \u00a3882m, British Marine highlighted a recent silver lining: in the immediate months following the referendum, the industry had undeniably benefited from the sharp depreciation of the pound against both the dollar and the euro, a",
        "A fragile accord, a Russian initiative to carve out four \"de-escalation zones,\" was cautiously embraced by Turkey and Iran on Thursday, yet it immediately met with the profound, weary skepticism of the main Syrian opposition grouping. Their deep-seated distrust, born of years of shattered ceasefires and unfulfilled promises, left little room for faith in such a paper peace. Even as the ink dried on this new proposition, the grim, relentless drumbeat of violence continued; activists elsewhere in Syria reported that government aircraft had pounded central Hama province, while the familiar sounds of shelling and gunfire echoed through other besieged areas, a bitter irony to any talk of calm. The opposition High Negotiations Committee (HNC) articulated its deep misgivings on Friday, lamenting the absence of any credible \"safeguards and compliance mechanisms\" within the safe zones plan. Their refusal to accept Iran, a nation they view as a key architect of their suffering, as a guarantor of peace, underscored the chasm of mistrust that persists. In a glimmer of cautious hope, perhaps born of sheer exhaustion, UN special envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, told the BBC that the agreement held a fragile importance precisely because it was championed by three powerful nations who, if genuinely committed, possessed the leverage to make it a reality. Yet, the fragile hope quickly threatened to unravel; the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) reported that Syrian fighter jets, in a chilling defiance of the proposed calm, bombed rebel positions in Hama on Saturday. A rebel commander, his voice heavy with the certainty of conflict, confirmed that fierce fighting had erupted just after midnight, shattering any illusion of immediate peace, Reuters reports. The Syrian military, in a telling silence that spoke volumes, offered no immediate comment on the burgeoning violence, leaving the world to interpret their tacit indifference or strategic calculation. This \"memorandum on the creation of de-escalation areas,\" a grand pronouncement from the Russian military following talks in Kazakhstan's capital Astana, and its full text duly published by Russia's foreign ministry on Saturday, outlined an objective both noble and daunting: to finally halt the incessant attacks from all belligerents, to \"provide the conditions for the safe and voluntary return of refugees\" \u2014 a distant dream for many \u2014 and to ensure the swift flow of desperately needed relief supplies and medical aid. These four proposed zones, intended to offer a temporary reprieve for",
        "The country's Chamber of Deputies had already given its assent to the landmark legislation, setting the stage for a pivotal vote in the Senate. Following a protracted 14-hour session marked by at times impassioned and contentious debate, the Senate ultimately endorsed the bill by a narrow margin of just six votes. This comprehensive law, which not only establishes marriage equality but also grants same-sex couples the right to adopt, faced formidable opposition, particularly from the influential Catholic Church and various other religious organizations. Despite this substantial resistance, the legislation, championed by President Cristina Fernandez's centre-left government, successfully navigated the final parliamentary hurdle, passing with 33 votes in favour, 27 against, and three abstentions. As the legislative proceedings extended into the early hours, the areas surrounding Congress became a focal point for intense public sentiment, with fervent supporters and determined opponents of the bill staging concurrent demonstrations. Maria Rachid, president of the Argentine Federation of Lesbians, Gays, Bisexuals and Transsexuals, articulated the prevailing sentiment among proponents, stating that \"nearly every political and social figure has spoken out in favour of marriage equality,\" expressing hope that the Senate's decision would reflect this societal shift and render Argentina \"a more just country for all families.\" Conversely, Ines Frank, representing Argentine Families Argentina, underscored the conservative perspective, asserting that their opposition was not discriminatory but rooted in the belief that \"the essence of a family is between two people of opposite sexes.\" Prior to this national enactment, Argentina had witnessed a series of same-sex marriages, some of which were subsequently annulled by the Supreme Court, creating a period of significant legal controversy and highlighting the fragmented nature of existing protections. While civil unions between people of the same sex were already legally recognized in Buenos",
        "Predictably, the party's 54 sitting MPs are poised for a swift endorsement as candidates, a seemingly perfunctory step solidifying their established positions, yet more critically, a reckoning awaits Natalie McGarry and Michelle Thomson, two figures who, despite their initial election under the SNP banner, now inhabit a political limbo as independent members, their future hanging precariously in the balance. Meanwhile, Labour's executive is also gearing up to map out its own candidate selection, a process no doubt fraught with internal machinations, even as the Conservatives and Lib Dems have already seen ambitious challengers emerge, eager to stake their claims. The political landscape was abruptly reshaped for the UK, thrust towards an unexpected polling day on 8 June following Prime Minister Theresa May's bold announcement of a snap election \u2013 a move overwhelmingly, almost emphatically, endorsed by MPs in a resounding 552 to 13 vote, signaling a collective, if perhaps reluctant, acceptance of her strategic gambit. Notably, and perhaps tellingly, Ms McGarry and Ms Thomson stood as singular figures among Scottish MPs, casting the only two dissenting votes against the early election, a stark contrast to the SNP members' collective, calculated abstention. Should these two not secure a return, the SNP faces the immediate and pressing task of identifying five new candidates, including three for seats that proved elusive in 2015, adding layers of complexity to their electoral strategy; already, a palpable buzz surrounds the SNP ticket, with numerous party activists eagerly declaring their intent to vie for the Glasgow East and Edinburgh West seats, now vacated by the former incumbents, seeing an opportunity in the shifting sands. With an almost frantic urgency, the UK Labour party, embracing modern political communication, issued its call for prospective parliamentary candidates via Twitter on Friday, inviting party members to apply with a tight deadline of noon on Sunday, a testament to the accelerated pace of this unexpected election. The Scottish Labour executive, meanwhile, convenes over the weekend, tasked with the crucial agreement of their selection procedure, their leader Kezia Dugdale projecting an air of confident readiness, asserting that the party had been",
        "So, the charity, they're really pushing hard, aren't they? They want to see 10% of the staggering 4.8 million Syrians who've been displaced by this brutal civil war actually resettled into new homes by the end of the year. But here's the kicker, folks: ahead of these crucial UN talks in Geneva on the crisis, the numbers they've highlighted are truly sobering. Only a tiny fraction, just 1.4% of those people, have actually received help so far. Oxfam, they're not holding back, calling the UK's plan to resettle 20,000 Syrians by 2020 \"not good enough.\" Now, Britain, they're defending themselves, saying they're also heavily focused on providing aid right there in the region, and you have to admit, their pledge of \u00c2\u00a32.3bn to help people affected by this humanitarian catastrophe makes them the second-largest bilateral donor in the world, right after the US. But Oxfam, they're firm: while Britain has indeed been incredibly generous with financial aid for those displaced by Syria's civil war, they absolutely \"can and should do more.\" Their argument is pretty clear, isn't it? Countries with strong economies and well-developed infrastructures, they need to shoulder a far greater responsibility for these refugees than nations like Lebanon and Jordan, where thousands upon thousands of Syrians are now desperately trying to build a new life. The UK-based charity is insistent that this Geneva conference must result in \"urgent solutions, offering people safe and legal routes to a welcome\" in other countries. They've painstakingly examined the pledges from 28 nations \u2013 members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and signatories to the 1951 Convention on Refugees \u2013 and what they found is disheartening. While these nations have promised to take in almost 130,000 Syrian refugees, a mere 67,000 have actually arrived. That 10% target Oxfam is pushing for by the end of 2016, that's the proportion the UN itself says are the most vulnerable and in dire need of resettlement. And when you look at Oxfam's analysis, only Canada, Germany, and Norway have actually exceeded their \"fair share\" \u2013 a measure, mind you, based on the size of their economies. Five other nations \u2013 Australia, Finland, Iceland, Sweden,",
        "As the calendar page turns to December's final eve, the last whisper of ink will grace the paper, a solemn farewell on the 31st, reflecting a global tide where the rustle of turning pages yields to the silent glow of screens, and the once-robust rivers of traditional advertising slowly recede. Newsweek, a storied vessel, found a new course two years prior, merging with the vibrant currents of the internet news group, the Daily Beast. Its founder, Tina Brown, speaks of a burgeoning digital audience, now more than 15 million unique visitors a month, a seventy percent surge from the year before. Her words, an elegy and a clarion call, acknowledge the ache in the hearts of those who \"love the romance of print\" and cherish \"the unique weekly camaraderie of those hectic hours before the close on Friday night.\" It is a moment \"extremely difficult,\" a poignant sunset for a tangible tradition, yet she urges an embrace of \"the all-digital future,\" affirming that the soul of its journalism, its powerful purpose, remains undimmed, though the challenging economics of paper and press have become an unyielding tide.\n\nBorn in 1933, a weekly chronicler of global events, Newsweek stood sentinel, its pages reflecting the world's tumultuous journey for eighty years. But just as the world shifted, so too did the very ground beneath the publishing realm, not least in how consumers now seek their news. The once-mighty readership, a peak of three million souls, has dwindled to half, a quiet ebb in the sea of subscribers. This fading tide, coupled with the ebbing flow of print advertising revenues, has steered Newsweek to cast off its physical form entirely. Newsweek Global, a digital spirit, will now navigate the unseen currents of the internet, seeking connection with the seventy million who now touch tablet screens in the US, a number that has soared from a mere thirteen million in a blink of two years. Though vast, this digital ocean is also crowded, a swirling vortex where voices vie for attention, and standing tall, analysts warn, will be a formidable quest. Yet, as its 80th anniversary looms, the magazine's heart beats on, resolute in its mission: to \"sustain the journalism that gives the magazine its purpose,\" to brave the new dawn of \"the all-digital future.\" This decision is not a surrender of quality, for its brand and reporting remain \"as powerful as ever,\" but rather a strategic retreat from the \"challenging economics of print publishing and",
        "Spencer Flower, a 72-year-old Conservative councillor for East Dorset and former leader of Dorset County Council, maintained that his involvement as a non-executive director of the charitable social housing company Synergy Housing Ltd, for which he received an annual allowance of approximately \u00c2\u00a35,000, was not relevant to a pivotal debate in February 2013 concerning the future of housing development within east Dorset. However, a district judge at Bournemouth Magistrates' Court found him guilty of voting illegally, ruling that the firm could have potentially benefitted from the passage of the East Dorset core strategy. Despite having declared his interest in the charity prior to the meeting, he was found to have taken part in the vote \"without reasonable excuse\" despite his clear pecuniary interest, thereby contravening specific regulations outlined within the Localism Act 2011. The court's decision allowed him to remain in public office, though he was given a six-month conditional discharge, described as the lowest possible penalty, and ordered to pay \u00c2\u00a3930 in court costs. Speaking outside court, Mr. Flower declined to comment on his political future, stating he was \"surprised and disappointed that the court has found for the prosecution this morning on a technicality,\" and emphasizing that \"the court emphasised the total lack of any personal gain or intent on my part.\" The vote in question concerned whether the comprehensive core strategy for the area should be referred to the secretary of state for final approval. This strategy included proposals for redevelopment in Wimborne, and although no formal planning permission had been submitted, it was perceived that certain social housing properties managed by Synergy could be improved through the involvement of developers Wyatt, creating the potential for benefit. Mr. Flower was formally charged in November, at which point he temporarily stepped aside from his leadership role at Dorset County Council to address the legal proceedings. Two other charges, related to a failure to disclose an interest in Zebra Property Solutions Ltd to both East Dorset Council and Dorset County Council between 1 July 2012 and 6 March 2013, had previously been withdrawn. A spokesperson for Christchurch Borough Council and East Dorset District Council confirmed that Councillor Flower continues to serve as a",
        "David Bowie's poignant final album, *Blackstar*, maintained its commanding position at number one for a third consecutive week, emblematic of a profound resurgence in public appreciation following his passing. This posthumous triumph was further underscored by a remarkable seven additional Bowie albums populating the Top 40, including *Best of Bowie*, *Hunky Dory*, and *Ziggy Stardust* all securing places within the Top 10, alongside *Nothing Has Changed* (5), *Heroes* (28), *Diamond Dogs* (30), *Station to Station* (32), and *Scary Monsters* (36). While Adele's latest offering steadfastly held its ground at number two, the highest new album entry arrived courtesy of Suede, a band deeply influenced by Bowie's artistry, whose new release debuted impressively at number six. Concurrently, Rihanna's much-anticipated album, *Anti*, notably failed to register on the chart following its Thursday release. This unusual outcome stemmed from its initial distribution as a complimentary offering via the streaming service Tidal, rendering it ineligible under official chart company regulations which stipulate that free downloads do not contribute towards Top 40 placement. Despite this, the Barbadian superstar achieved a significant impact on the singles chart, with \"Work,\" her collaboration with Drake, entering at number 13 after a mere 48 hours of availability. The week's highest new single entry, at number three, was claimed by London-based producer Jonas Blue's reimagined dance rendition of Tracy Chapman's seminal track, \"Fast Car.\" Blue's \"tropical-flavoured\" remake, featuring the vocals of Dakota, surpassed the original's peak chart performance of number five in 1988, and even outstripped its 2011 resurgence to number four following a notable rendition on *Britain's Got Talent*. Blue, according to a statement on his official Facebook page, was motivated by a desire to \"recreate one of his mother's favourite songs that he remembered hearing on repeat as a child.\" Meanwhile, Canadian sensation Shawn Mendes continued his dominance at the",
        "From his consecrated pulpit on Sunday, Mr Joshua, his voice imbued with the weight of divine revelation, declared to his expectant congregation that he had been granted a vivid premonition: a woman, he assured them with absolute conviction, would secure the American presidency. Yet, the week unfolded a starkly different narrative. When Donald Trump clinched a decisive victory on Tuesday, a result that sent ripples of shock across the globe, visitors to the affluent preacher's Facebook page quickly noticed a significant void: the prophecy, once a bold testament to his prophetic sight, had been conspicuously removed.\n\nThis charismatic figure, revered by his vast following as \"the prophet,\" stands as one of Nigeria's most prominent and powerful evangelists. His influence stretches far beyond national borders, resonating deeply across the African continent, where his esteemed flock includes numerous top-tier politicians seeking spiritual counsel. The contentious US election prediction had initially been broadcast with authority across Mr Joshua's own Emmanuel TV, a sprawling media empire, before finding its way to YouTube through eager individual uploads. A key section of that very \"prophecy,\" once proudly featured on the preacher's Facebook page, similarly vanished into the digital ether. \"Ten days ago I saw the president of America with a narrow win... What I frankly saw was a woman,\" the erased statement had confidently proclaimed, painting a future that never materialized.\n\nThe aftermath ignited a digital firestorm, with TB Joshua's name blazing across Twitter trends in Nigeria, Ghana, and South Africa. The online landscape became a vibrant canvas for shared memes, playfully \u2013 and sometimes cuttingly \u2013 satirizing his misjudgment.

        "Participants in the esteemed annual competition are allocated precisely five minutes to present the most elaborate and persuasive fabrication conceivable. This year's victor, George Kemp, hailing from Maryport, Cumbria, expressed considerable surprise at his triumph, particularly given his reported indisposition with a debilitating chest infection during the event. Kemp's winning submission detailed an intricate narrative involving an unexpected encounter with Donald Trump and his spouse within a submerged hotel. The core of his fabrication revolved around the ingenious construction of a miniature submarine from his father's antiquated bubble car, which subsequently undertook a fantastical voyage to the Isle of Man. During this aquatic expedition, he claimed to have encountered various celebrated personalities aboard a distinctively Scottish submarine, purportedly fashioned from colossal shortbread tins. A notable embellishment to this preposterous tale included the purported sale of these unique vessels to the United States of America by prominent Scottish political figures, Nicola Sturgeon and Alex Salmond. The previous year's champion, Mike Naylor, colloquially known as 'Monkey Liar' and representing Wasdale, secured the second-place position, with Helen Jordan achieving third. The esteemed roster of past laureates features notable personalities such as comedian and television presenter Sue Perkins, who claimed victory in 2006. The international appeal of the contest was underscored in 2014, when a participant journeyed from Germany specifically to compete.

        "A storm of dismissals swept through the early session, Mark Footitt\u2019s searing spell claiming 3-52 as the visitors found five wickets plundered before the sanctuary of lunch. The ominous start was punctuated by Sam Curran\u2019s swift dispatch of England opener Haseeb Hameed for a second-ball duck, a stark signal of the perilous conditions. Footitt, fresh from an eight-wicket haul in Surrey's season opener, was relentless, accounting for Alex Davies, stand-in captain Liam Livingstone, and Dane Vilas, while the Curran brothers each tasted success in that initial, devastating flurry that saw Lancashire reeling, five wickets down inside just 22 overs. Yet, from the precipice, a remarkable recovery began to unfurl, orchestrated by the contrasting brilliance of Jordan Clark and the seasoned wisdom of Shivnarine Chanderpaul. The retired West Indies international, a figure of serene defiance, steadied the ship with a measured 85 not out, first forging a crucial 55-run stand with Ryan McLaren, a partnership that brought a much-needed calm to the turbulent innings after the early decimation. When McLaren departed, dismissed by Gareth Batty, the stage was set for Clark to join Chanderpaul, and together they embarked on an unbeaten, monumental partnership of 172. Clark, batting surprisingly at number eight, found his rhythm with astonishing speed, soon eclipsing Chanderpaul's individual score and even beating the veteran to his own half-century, a testament to his burgeoning confidence and aggressive intent. The 26-year-old, whose previous highest score stood at 84 not out, reached his maiden first-class century with a huge, audacious pulled six, a powerful declaration of his arrival, just moments before the day's play concluded. His electrifying innings, punctuated by 17 fours and three sixes, was a masterclass in controlled aggression, defying the very conditions that had humbled his teammates. Even the premature halt to",
        "The sprawling retail empire of Ikea achieved a robust financial year, with sales soaring to an impressive \u20ac34.2bn (\u00a328.8bn) by August. This substantial sum was bolstered by the strategic addition of 12 new physical stores across its global network, contributing to a total sales increase of 7.1%. Though this represented a healthy expansion, it marked a moderation from the more accelerated 11% surge witnessed in the preceding 12-month period, hinting at a maturing market presence. Crucially, sales at established outlets, operational for over a year, held steady with a commendable 5% rise, mirroring the consistent performance of the prior year. The privately-owned Swedish conglomerate highlighted Poland as a particularly vibrant market, where sales dramatically jumped by approximately 20%, positioning it as the fastest-growing territory, while the expansive markets of Australia and Canada also delivered strong results. Germany, a foundational pillar of its European operations, continued its reign as the retailer's largest market, closely followed by the immense consumer landscape of the United States. Looking ahead, Ikea is poised to unfurl its iconic blue and yellow banners in the exciting new frontiers of India and Serbia this year, expanding its impressive footprint to 340 outlets across 28 nations. However, its ambitious expansion into the vast Russian market has encountered a significant pause, as the company endeavors to resolve a complex web of lingering \"old legal disputes.\" Within the strategically important UK market, where Ikea operates 19 stores, further growth is firmly on the horizon with new, eagerly anticipated outlets planned for Exeter, Sheffield, and a pivotal location in southeast London. Beyond the traditional brick-and-mortar expansion, Ikea has also keenly adapted to evolving consumer habits, inaugurating 19 dedicated \"click and collect\" outlets globally.

        "Back in March of 1981, just outside a hotel in Washington, Mr. Reagan and three others were injured in a shocking shooting incident that captured the world's attention. Mr. Hinckley was, perhaps controversially, found not guilty by reason of insanity, but immediately sent for treatment to a Washington hospital, beginning what would become a decades-long stay. Now, many years later, in July, a judge finally ruled that Mr. Hinckley, who is 61 today, was no longer considered a danger to himself or indeed, to the public. This wasn't an abrupt decision, mind you; Mr. Hinckley had already been spending 17 days a month at his mother's home in Virginia, but always under very strict conditions, a slow process of reintroduction. And so, Associated Press reported that he had arrived at her home just this past Saturday, having been officially freed. Marking 30 years since Reagan's shooting Life after shooting a US president As part of his release he will: The shooting itself, coming just weeks into Ronald Reagan's presidency, truly sent shockwaves around the world, making everyone question the security of even the highest office. Mr. Reagan, of course, was shot in the lung, but thankfully recovered; however, his press secretary, James Brady, suffered much more grievously, shot in the head, enduring brain damage that confined him to a wheelchair for the rest of his life. Tragically, Mr. Brady's death in 2014, at the age of 73, was later ruled a homicide, though no further charges were brought against Hinckley. Two law enforcement officers also sustained injuries, thankfully less serious. US District Judge Paul Friedman's judgement really highlighted the medical assessments, which clearly showed that Mr. Hinckley had experienced",

Newport dairy farmer John Sollis, lamenting the profound impact, branded the situation a \"disaster\" for a community suddenly stripped of its dues and a crucial local facility. Documents meticulously filed on the Companies House website paint a stark picture of financial ruin, revealing one livestock trader burdened with a staggering debt exceeding \u00a3107,000, while others grapple with significant five-figure sums, their livelihoods left precariously balanced. Liquidator Gary Stones, in his sobering report, offered a glimmer of a phantom hope, stating that any potential payments to unsecured creditors were \"totally dependent on the collection of the Irish book debt,\" a distant, elusive promise hinging on almost \u00a3470,000 owed to Emcol by an Irish firm. Mr. Sollis, himself owed nearly \u00a315,000 by Emcol, reiterated the \"disaster\" not only for the substantial sums lost by local people but also for the critical absence of a nearby abattoir, forcing farmers to transport their stock, including injured casualties, further afield, incurring additional, burdensome costs, with the nearest alternative now an arduous journey to Cross Hands in Carmarthenshire. NFU Cymru President Stephen James, whose own loss stood at just over \u00a31,000, underscored the \"huge blow\" of the abattoir's closure, particularly its vital role in handling injured cows; now, these animals face the grim necessity of being shot on farm premises, a harsh reality that translates directly into a profound financial loss for farmers.",
        "Ben Purdy, a young man of just 18, tragically lost his life after a confrontation in Bermondsey, a fatal outcome disproportionate to the initial dispute. He had intervened to protect his girlfriend from the \"threatening\" messages persistently sent by her ex-partner, Michael Bagnall, 22, via phone and social media \u2013 a modern form of harassment that escalated with devastating speed. Bagnall, despite having a new girlfriend, evidently harbored a possessive resentment that \"rankled,\" as prosecutor Crispin Aylett QC observed, fueling the digital intimidation. The subsequent murder saw Bagnall and his uncle, Andrew Bayne, 37, found guilty, highlighting a concerning intergenerational complicity in the violence that culminated in Purdy's death.\n\nThe initial \"skirmish\" \u2013 a seemingly minor confrontation between Mr. Purdy and his two friends, Callum Malone and Jack Walker, against Bagnall \u2013 quickly spiraled. This impulsive act by Purdy, born from a desire to address the harassment, was tragically misjudged, a \"very stupid thing to have sought to do,\" in Aylett's critical assessment, that ultimately cost him his life. Following this initial encounter, the defendants embarked on a calculated, predatory search for Mr. Purdy through Bermondsey. Their discovery of him in Mossington Gardens led to the cold, precise act where Andrew Bayne shot Mr. Purdy in the head, then terrifyingly brandished the weapon at Callum before making his escape. Mr. Purdy succumbed to \"catastrophic injuries\" the following day, a stark reminder of the irreversible consequences of firearm violence. Bayne's conviction for possessing a gun with intent, alongside Bagnall's for affray, underscored the inherent criminality that transformed a domestic",
        "Masai Graham secured the prestigious award with his critically acclaimed gag: \"My dad suggested I register for a donor card, he's a man after my own heart.\" This winning entry exemplifies the competition's preference for concise, dark observational humor, skillfully employing a pun to achieve a dual layer of meaning and elicit immediate comedic impact. The rigorous multi-stage adjudication process involved an initial assessment by a distinguished panel of ten expert judges, who meticulously evaluated an average of 60 different comedy performances, sifting through more than 3,600 minutes of material, before presenting their curated selection to a diverse public cohort of 2,000 individuals. These participants then cast their votes to determine the ultimate victor. Graham's triumph, following his consistent shortlisting in 2014 and 2015, represents the culmination of sustained comedic development and was met with his expressed honor, noting, \"It's an incredible honour to land Joke of the Fringe. Not bad for someone from West Brom!\" This sentiment highlights both the personal significance of the accolade and a sense of regional pride. Preceding winners, including Tim Vine, Stewart Francis, and Zoe Lyon, establish a notable lineage of comedic excellence fostered by the competition, which is consistently supported by the broadcasting entity Dave. Comedian Stuart Mitchell's second-place entry, \"Why is it old people say 'there's no place like home', yet when you put them in one...\", also demonstrated a strong command of a similar blend of dark humor and social commentary. Crucially, the integrity of the voting system was upheld through a blind adjudication protocol, wherein the identity of the comedian and their specific show remained undisclosed to the voting",
        "The Halle Orchestra has articulated a strategic initiative to establish a new educational institution in Stoke-on-Trent, targeting a comprehensive age range from primary to secondary pupils, specifically seven to nineteen-year-olds, with an anticipated opening in September 2020. This ambitious project, planned in collaboration with an academy trust and the City Learning Trust, is conceived as part of the governmental free schools programme, contingent upon approval from the Department for Education. John Summers, chief executive of the Halle Orchestra, posits that this endeavour will leverage music as a fundamental pedagogical tool to \"raise aspirations\" and cultivate enhanced achievement across the broader academic curriculum. The proposed school's distinctive offering includes a significant allocation of student time\u201440%\u2014dedicated to specialist music classes, alongside invaluable opportunities for masterclasses led by professional musicians, access to Halle concerts, and engagement with artists in residence. Students will further benefit from direct collaboration with integral components of the Halle family, including the Halle Choir, The Halle Youth Orchestra, and Halle for Youth, thereby capitalising on the orchestra's extensive expertise in high-level performance, instrumental coaching, and choral training. Summers underscores that this deep institutional knowledge will be instrumental in developing a music curriculum designed to directly bolster overall academic success and ambition. This innovative model finds a compelling precedent in the German city of Bremen, where a high-profile partnership saw the Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie Bremen integrate its rehearsal rooms and headquarters within a comprehensive school on a housing estate. This immersive presence of professional musicians within the school's daily life demonstrably contributed to a reduction in truancy rates and",
        "Leading the solemn procession were several individuals directly impacted by the devastating suicide bomb attacks on Belgium's Zaventem Airport and Maalbeek metro station, which tragically claimed 32 lives. Belgian broadcasters characterized the march as notably \"calm and silent,\" reflecting a collective somber reflection. Originally scheduled for the week following the horrific 22 March attacks, the demonstration was prudently postponed by officials due to persistent security threats, underscoring the lingering apprehension in the capital. Relatives of the victims, alongside dedicated paramedics and airport personnel profoundly affected by the atrocities, joined citizens of various religious faiths in a unifying display of resilience. Participants carried floral tributes, a poignant symbol of remembrance for those whose lives were cut short. The procession thoughtfully traversed past the Molenbeek neighbourhood \u2013 a district tragically associated with several alleged perpetrators of both the Brussels and Paris attacks \u2013 before culminating at the impromptu memorial site outside the city's historic stock exchange. Hassan Bousetta, one of the principal organisers, conveyed to the AFP news agency the profound sentiment guiding the event: \"When our fellow citizens, defenceless civilians, are cut down in a cowardly attack, all citizens should stand up to express their disgust and solidarity.\" Despite the profound message, the turnout, estimated at less than half of the 15,000 hoped for by organisers, suggested a potential impact of the earlier postponement or ongoing security concerns. The Brussels attacks were claimed by the Islamic State (IS) terrorist group, which also asserted responsibility for the coordinated gun and bomb assaults in Paris on 13 November that",
        "The company announced it had secured formal clearance from Senegalese government authorities to proceed with its comprehensive evaluation plan for offshore oil discoveries. Cairn, having made two significant discoveries, FAN-1 and SNE-1, in the area last year, has estimated the fields could collectively hold recoverable resources exceeding a billion barrels of oil equivalent, establishing the potential for a new hydrocarbon province. The evaluation plan is scheduled to commence imminently with an extensive 3D seismic survey designed to refine geological understanding and identify optimal drilling locations. Following this, later in the current year, Cairn intends to launch a multi-well exploration and appraisal programme to further delineate the discoveries and assess their commercial viability. Edinburgh-based Cairn holds a 40% working interest in three contiguous blocks offshore Senegal: Sangomar Deep, Sangomar Offshore, and Rufisque Offshore. Its joint venture partners include ConocoPhillips, holding a 35% interest, and FAR Ltd with 15%, while Petrosen, the Senegal National Oil Company, maintains a 10% carried interest through the exploration phase. Concurrently, in its latest half-yearly financial report, Cairn also disclosed the initiation of international arbitration proceedings against the government of India concerning an ongoing tax dispute. Indian authorities have reportedly prevented Cairn from monetizing its 10% residual shareholding in Cairn India Limited (CIL) through an asset freeze, effectively impounding the value. The dispute originated in March when the company received a retrospective tax bill amounting to $1.6bn, augmented by interest and penalties, relating to the 2006-07 tax year, a period when Cairn was preparing for the initial public offering of Cairn India on the Mumbai stock exchange. Cairn has formally contested the validity of this retrospective demand and intends to seek restitution for financial losses incurred due to the impoundment and the subsequent decline in the market value of",
        "The air in Baghdad crackled with tension as tear gas billowed and live bullets whistled through the streets, unleashed to repel the surging, overwhelmingly Shia Muslim crowds who were out there, making their voices heard, protesting a litany of grievances: the suffocating corruption that strangles daily life and the gaping failures in security that leave them vulnerable. Officials, clearly rattled, hastily imposed a curfew across the Iraqi capital, a measure that has since been lifted, but not before the protesters achieved a stunning feat; for the second time in a single month, they had managed to breach the supposedly impenetrable walls of the city's heavily fortified government area, a direct challenge to authority. From his position of immense influence, the powerful Shia Muslim cleric Moqtada Sadr wasted no time in condemning the brutal use of force against his people, lending his formidable weight to the demonstrators and calling their uprising a \"peaceful, spontaneous revolt\" \u2013 a stark contrast to the bullets and gas they faced. The cost of this defiance was immediate and painful, with at least 50 demonstrators reported wounded in the clashes, their anger stemming from a deep-seated belief that the government has utterly neglected the urgent reforms desperately needed by ordinary Iraqis. This neglect comes as the state is already struggling on multiple fronts: battling the relentless campaign of the so-called Islamic State group, or IS, and grappling with the severe pinch of plummeting global oil revenues. Indeed, the Sunni jihadist group, IS, continues to cast a long, dark shadow, holding swathes of western and northern Iraq and unleashing a horrific wave of recent attacks that have left scores dead. Amidst this backdrop of insecurity and frustration, the protesters' audacity reached new heights: some even managed to storm the very offices of the prime minister and the hallowed halls of parliament \u2013 a direct assault on the Green Zone itself, that symbolic, heavily guarded enclave in Baghdad, housing not just the parliament and key government buildings, but also numerous foreign embassies. While authorities quickly asserted they had \"completely regained control\" and the protesters had withdrawn, the message had been sent, loud and clear. And who is this Moqtada Sadr, whose words carry such weight? He is a figure of immense and complex history. His militia group, the Mehdi Army, burst onto the scene after the 2003 US-led invasion, expertly channeling and galvanizing furious anti-US",
        "Muslim cleric Mehboob Akhtar, a prominent figure from Stoke-on-Trent, was recently handed a substantial prison sentence alongside nine co-conspirators, including his own wife and daughter. The group was found culpable of orchestrating a sophisticated scheme involving fraudulent representations to mortgage lenders, which enabled them to illicitly acquire properties valued at nearly \u00a31 million, with an alleged intent to \"control and dominate\" specific urban areas. Mr. Akhtar himself received a 14-year custodial sentence at Birmingham Crown Court. Following a comprehensive trial last month, the 60-year-old, residing on Farman Close in Fenton, faced conviction on 11 distinct charges, notably encompassing five counts of conspiracy to commit fraud and the significant evasion of \u00a3271,000 from Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC). The judicial proceedings revealed that Akhtar, also identified by the moniker Saint Pirwali Pandariman, was the principal architect behind this extensive criminal enterprise, which spanned over a decade from 2003 to 2014. Originating from Pakistan, he had cultivated a public image as an influential faith leader within Fenton, reportedly facilitating the collection of several million pounds in charitable donations through the local Darbar Unique Centre, funds ostensibly designated for poverty alleviation. However, Judge Stephen Eyre sternly remarked that Akhtar had profoundly \"let down his followers,\" asserting that he had exploited \"the prestige and devotion of others to facilitate this offending.\" The judge further elaborated that Akhtar's revered \"role as a spiritual guide provided cover,\" enabling him to finance his illicit activities through donations that were, in part, secured by virtue of his spiritual standing. Evidence presented in court demonstrated Akhtar's deliberate strategy to distance himself from direct involvement in the fraudulent paperwork, instead leveraging his wife, daughter, and niece to submit mortgage applications. A police operation in September 2012, involving searches of residences and offices linked to the syndicate, yielded a cache of forged documents and incriminating emails pertinent to the conspiracy. His wife, Khadija Akhtar, 54, of Hartwell Lane, Stoke, was similarly convicted of offences including cheating HMRC and conspiracy to obtain a money transfer by deception, resulting in a four-year and three-month imprisonment. Their daughter, Rushbamani Akhtar, 29, received a three-and-a-half-year sentence for her convictions related to facilitating the acquisition, retention, use, or control of criminal property,",
        "Jones, the reigning Olympic champion, is set to defend her title in the highly competitive -57kg weight category at the Rio 2016 Games. Having secured gold four years prior, the 23-year-old attributes her early drive for success to watching elite athletes like Kelly Holmes during her formative years in north Wales. She reflects on this journey, stating, \"I remember watching people like Kelly Holmes on the TV and that's what inspired me to want to go and get a gold medal.\" Jones now recognizes her own position as a significant role model, noting the positive impact her achievements have had, particularly in inspiring young girls. \"To think I'm one of those role models now and people are looking up to me is lovely,\" she shares, further observing, \"I've seen the difference from London how many girls have got into taekwondo because they've watched it on the TV.\" Her involvement in taekwondo began at age 15, spurred by her grandfather Martin's encouragement to engage in structured activity. Jones recalls the early days of her training, stating, \"When I first started taekwondo I think there was only about four or five girls in the whole club.\" This observation underscores the significant increase in female participation she has witnessed, a transformation she describes as \"amazing to see.\" She emphasizes the broader message: \"Sport doesn't have to be just for boys - girls are good at it too.\" Since her historic win at London 2012, Jones, currently the -57kg world number one, has maintained her competitive edge, securing a World Grand Prix title and two European championships. Her London victory was particularly momentous, making her Britain's inaugural Olympic taekwondo champion through a decisive win over China's double world champion, Yuzhuo Hou, in the final. This achievement followed closely on the heels of her becoming her country's youngest Olympic champion, a title she earned just two years after her gold medal performance at the 2010 inaugural Youth Olympics in Singapore. While her motivation has naturally experienced fluctuations over the past four years, the Flint-bred athlete remains resolutely focused on securing a second Olympic gold. She contrasts her preparation for Rio with her London experience: \"For London I only came into the national team in 2010, literally two years before the",
        "The alleged assault on Remus Hamza, 40, against a 20-year-old near Cardiff University on 20 September critically underscores the perilous vulnerability faced by young women returning home alone in the early hours. The prosecution at Newport Crown Court vehemently contended that her extreme intoxication rendered her incapable of legal consent, a central tenet of the case against Hamza, a Cardiff resident of Romanian origin who vehemently denies the rape charge. Her fragmented journey home, starting from Greyfriars Road, through a secluded underpass near City Hall, and onto Museum Avenue around 02:00 GMT, details a path that tragically converged with the defendant's alleged predatory actions behind a bush, highlighting the common narrative of an isolated individual navigating urban spaces after dark. Prosecutor Claire Pickthall starkly articulated to the jury that the victim's profound amnesia surrounding the alleged assault, extending even to the act of intercourse, served as unequivocal proof of her incapacitation. This level of intoxication, Pickthall asserted, negated any possibility of consent, thereby classifying the defendant's actions as rape, a calculated exploitation of \"single, drunk females\" \u2013 a chilling depiction of targeted vulnerability. The crucial intervention of witness Lee Neill, whose immediate suspicion of \"something sinister\" upon observing Hamza with the victim near the National Museum of Wales prompted him to document the scene with a photograph, proved pivotal. The ensuing flight of Hamza, startled by the camera's flash, and Neill's subsequent pursuit, illustrate the immediate unfolding of the crisis. Yet, the initial confusion surrounding the victim's traumatic state, leading her to misidentify her rescuer as her assailant and Neill's subsequent wrongful arrest, critically exposes the profound disarray and psychological impact wrought by such an ordeal, only to be untangled by the irrefutable clarity of DNA evidence linking Hamza to the crime. Despite her admitted consumption of wine, cider, and cocktails, and the subsequent memory void concerning her journey and the assault, the victim's resolute testimony to the jurors \u2013 that her \"moral compass\" would unequivocally preclude consent to sex with",
        "The body of Helen Bailey, 51, was discovered in July 2016, found within a disused cess pit located beneath the garage of her residence in Royston, Hertfordshire. This discovery followed a period during which she had not been seen since 11 April. Her fianc\u00e9e, Ian Stewart, faces charges of murder, which he denies. During the trial at St Albans Crown Court, witness Edward Farmer initially testified to having seen Ms. Bailey in a vehicle in Broadstairs, Kent, sometime between mid-April and June. He described observing her on Charlotte Street, in the vicinity of her holiday home in the town, \"driving what looked to be a Range Rover or that type of 4x4, a dark colour.\" Mr. Farmer further stated that Ms. Bailey was alone, a detail which contrasted with the defence's narrative that she had been kidnapped by two violent men and forcibly taken to Broadstairs. When pressed on the precise date of this alleged sighting, Mr. Farmer initially offered it as \"about five, maybe six weeks prior to the police interview [on 13 July].\" Ms. Bailey had officially been reported missing by Mr. Stewart on 15 April. Under subsequent cross-examination by the prosecution, Mr. Farmer conceded that the sighting could have occurred in March, weeks before the author was reported missing. He also admitted that he had \"no reason at all\" to reflect on the sighting until a reporter from The Sun interviewed him in June. Mr. Stewart, 56, of Baldock Road, Royston, Hertfordshire, stands accused of administering sedatives to his wife-to-be before suffocating her and subsequently",
        "The Republican candidate, Donald Trump, was observed to laugh off a supporter's assertion at a campaign rally in New Hampshire, which began with the declaration: \"We have a problem in this country - it's called Muslims.\" This statement, made at a Rochester event, immediately preceded the supporter's further claims that the sitting president, Barack Obama, was not only Muslim but also not an American, alongside unsubstantiated allegations of \"training camps growing where they want to kill us.\" Mr. Trump's initial reaction, \"I like this guy,\" followed by a rhetorical \"We need this question?\" before allowing the man to continue his monologue, drew immediate condemnation. Critically, Mr. Trump failed to explicitly refute the demonstrably false claims regarding President Obama's Christian faith and American birth, instead offering a vague commitment to investigate \"bad things happening.\" Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton swiftly criticized this inaction, labelling his failure to denounce \"hateful rhetoric\" and \"false statements about POTUS\" as \"disturbing and wrong\" via social media. Similarly, Democratic National Committee Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz issued a statement asserting that Mr. Trump's \"racism knows no bounds,\" underscoring the perceived gravity of the incident. In an attempt to mitigate the fallout, Mr. Trump's campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, downplayed the exchange, claiming to have only heard the portion of the question concerning \"training camps\" and subsequently redirecting the narrative by accusing the media of focusing on President Obama while \"the bigger issue is that Obama is waging a war against Christians in this country.\" This episode invoked parallels with the 2008 presidential campaign, where Republican nominee John McCain notably intervened to correct a supporter who voiced distrust of Mr. Obama due to a mistaken belief that he was \"an Arab,\" highlighting a contrast in leadership responses to prejudiced remarks. The incident also resonated with Mr. Trump's prominent role in the \"birther\" movement of 2011, when he publicly challenged President Obama to produce his birth certificate to counter unfounded rumors of a Kenyan birth, despite President Obama's clear documentation of his Hawaiian birth to an American mother and Kenyan father, and his open discussions of his Christian faith. Despite these recurring controversies and his lack of prior political experience, Mr. Trump maintained a leading position among Republican contenders in national polls, more than a year out from the general election.",
        "The relentless glare of the media spotlight, a stark contrast to his decades as a backbencher, now constantly tracks his every move as he articulates a policy platform markedly distinct from his predecessor's centrist leanings. Mr Corbyn has been vociferously critical of the government's perceived inaction regarding the unfolding Calais migrant crisis, asserting with conviction that the UK bears a profound responsibility to extend greater assistance. He conveyed to me, with unwavering resolve: \"These are human beings, these are people in desperate situations - they need our help and they need our support. There's a very large number of people going over to Calais to take aid and support to them - we should be part of the European programme both for Syrian refugees and other refugees.\" This compassionate stance on immigration stands in stark ideological opposition to the UK Independence Party, whose leader, Nigel Farage, addressed his annual conference in Doncaster today on the very same contentious issue. Farage questioned the very foundations of governmental planning, arguing how any administration could responsibly allocate resources for schooling or healthcare if the nation's demographic trajectory, to the nearest million, remained an unpredictable variable within a mere couple of years. Echoing this sentiment, the Kent Conservative MP and former immigration minister Damian Green also warned that an open-door immigration policy would be profoundly irresponsible. Yet, Mr Corbyn steadfastly insists that immigration remains a powerful, positive force for the UK. \"Our health service, our education service, much of our industrial development in Britain, has been greatly enhanced by the work done by people who have made their homes here, paid their taxes here, worked very hard here and given us this amazing cosmopolitan society that we have.\" He declared that rather than succumbing to fear, people should embrace the myriad opportunities that immigration unequivocally brings. No doubt this will be a pivotal message he intends to underscore to the party faithful as they converge in Brighton this weekend. Beyond immigration, he is poised to tackle other pressing national concerns, including the acute housing shortage, the urgent need for investment in vital infrastructure, and his determined opposition to the current benefits reform agenda. On top of these formidable tasks, he faces the crucial challenge of proving his capacity to bridge divides, not only among the Labour members who propelled him to leadership but",
        "The remains of British backpackers Miss Witheridge, 23, from Norfolk, and Mr Miller, 24, from Jersey, were discovered on a beach on the island of Koh Tao in September 2014, initiating a high-profile criminal investigation. Subsequently, Burmese migrant workers Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Tun were convicted of the killings in December 2015, receiving death sentences that were later affirmed by a Thai appeal court. The legal team representing the two men now faces a critical 30-day window to file a final appeal with the Supreme Court, Thailand's ultimate judicial authority. Prior to this, in May of the preceding year, the defendants' mothers had formally lodged appeals at the Koh Samui court, citing profound concerns regarding the integrity of the judgments, particularly the reliability of the DNA evidence presented during the initial investigation. As articulated by Andy Hall, a legal advisor to the families, \"We do not believe the court can conclude beyond reasonable doubt that Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo were responsible for the events which transpired in September 2014.\" Miss Witheridge, an enrolled student at the University of Essex, and Mr Miller, a civil and structural engineering graduate, were found to have succumbed to blunt force trauma. A subsequent post-mortem examination further confirmed that Miss Witheridge had also been subjected to sexual assault. Prosecutors contended that DNA profiles extracted from various sources, including cigarette butts, a condom, and the victims' bodies, established a definitive link between Lin and Phyo and the homicides. Conversely, the defendants, both Myanmar nationals, recanted their initial confessions, alleging they had been subjected to torture by law enforcement officials.",
        "The Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP) report illuminates the profound global economic burden of conflict, estimating its total cost at 13.4% of world GDP, a sum equivalent to the combined economies of Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Spain, and the United Kingdom. This staggering financial outlay underscores a deepening chasm between the world's most peaceful and least peaceful nations, a primary finding further emphasized by IEP Chief Executive Steve Killelea, who noted a concerning \"inequality with peace\" globally. While certain Western European countries have achieved \"historic levels of peace,\" characterized by exceptionally low murder rates and security expenditures, the report identifies a stark counterpoint in regions experiencing escalating violence. Syria, for instance, remains the world's least peaceful nation, sharply contrasting with Iceland's status as the most peaceful, a trend exacerbated by Libya's severe deterioration in 2014. The Middle East and North Africa has consequently surpassed South Asia as the world's most violent region. The human cost of this escalating instability is devastating, with conflict-related deaths surging from 49,000 in 2010 to 180,000 in 2014. Furthermore, terrorism fatalities increased by 61% in 2013, claiming nearly 18,000 lives predominantly in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nigeria, and Syria, all nations, alongside South Sudan and the Central African Republic, that witnessed increased violence in the preceding year. This immense expenditure is driven by significant increases in fatalities from internal conflicts, the burgeoning costs of supporting internally displaced persons (IDPs) and refugees, enhanced UN peacekeeping operations, and substantial GDP losses attributable to conflict. Notably, the financial burden of assisting approximately 50 million refugees and IDPs\u2014the highest number since World War II\u2014has escalated by 267% since 2008, reaching $128 billion. The IEP's analysis compellingly demonstrates that even a modest 10% reduction in global violence could inject an additional $1.43 trillion into the world economy. This sum represents a transformative opportunity, exceeding six times the amount required to resolve Greece's national debt and three times the total earnings of 1.1 billion of the world's most impoverished individuals, thereby highlighting the profound economic dividends inherent in fostering peace.",
        "The recent penalties levied by the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), fining Falcon and Pointer \u00a3175,000 for its relentless automated PPI calls and Direct Choice Home Improvements Ltd \u00a350,000 for the deeply disturbing practice of soliciting deceased relatives, underscore a profound regulatory challenge. Both companies, in a common evasion tactic, disingenuously claimed the illicit calls were made by a third party, attempting to shield themselves from direct accountability for their predatory tactics. Anne Jones, Assistant Commissioner for Wales, declared these actions sent a \"clear message to callous cold-callers,\" yet the very need for such a pronouncement, coupled with her observation that Swansea increasingly appears to be the UK's cold-call capital, suggests an endemic problem rather than an isolated incident. Her assertion that companies in the city are \"trying to cash in using ruthless business models based on illicit practices to make calls which are at best irksome and at worst distressing\" points to a systemic exploitation, where the relatively modest fines, especially for Falcon and Pointer, might be viewed as mere operational costs rather than effective deterrents, particularly against the backdrop of an investigation revealing Falcon and Pointer made a further two million calls *after* claiming to have ceased and *after* its licence revocation. The ICO's action against only six companies since 2013, despite the scale of the problem evidenced by Direct Choice Home Improvements Ltd receiving 168 complaints in just six months \u2013 likely a significant underrepresentation of the actual number of nuisance calls \u2013 raises questions about the scope and efficacy of enforcement. Ms Jones's reiterated warning that \"Our action will send a clear message to callous cold-callers operating in Swansea that they must follow the rules,\" following previous disregarded communications, highlights a blatant and cynical disregard for the law that left countless individuals feeling frustrated and harassed, eroding public trust. While Sandra Busby, managing director of the Welsh Contact Centre Forum, rightly distinguishes between credible companies and those \"in it for a quick buck, flagrantly disregarding rules and giving the industry a",
        "The morning air at Ashworth High Security Hospital was thick with an palpable tension as a significant walkout commenced, a collective act of protest over the controversial dismissal of two dedicated nurses, Kevin Gregson and Peter Hilton. Their careers now precariously balanced, Gregson and Hilton had been sacked following a harrowing incident involving a violent struggle with an unidentified patient, despite the Prison Officers' Association (POA) staunchly asserting that their actions constituted nothing more than \"reasonable force\" under extreme duress. Conversely, Mersey Care Trust, the formidable body overseeing the intricate operations at Ashworth, maintained a steadfast position, declaring that the compelling nature of the evidence left them with no alternative but to terminate the employment of the two individuals. Further details surrounding this deeply divisive story, alongside other unfolding news from the regions of Merseyside and Cheshire, continued to emerge as the dispute at the highly specialized unit, one of only three high-security hospitals of its kind across England and Wales, escalated rapidly from its inception at 07:00 GMT.\n\nSteve Gillan, the impassioned general secretary of the POA, spoke with conviction, his voice resonating with the perceived unfairness of the situation. \"I believe the general public will be utterly outraged and profoundly sympathetic to Mr Hilton and Mr Gregson,\" he declared, \"who were merely responding with essential intervention to a truly violent act in which the patient had launched a vicious headbutt at a colleague and continued to aggressively spit at staff members throughout the terrifying ordeal.\" Gillan vehemently argued that \"the actions of restraint were entirely reasonable and, crucially, the patient came to no lasting harm, unlike the nurses who endured the physical and emotional brunt of the assault. Whilst there should always be an unwavering duty of care towards our vulnerable patients, the very same unwavering duty must equally apply to the safety and well-being of",

Yet, this gentle tableau, offered by art broker Mossgreen to the vast, scrolling currents of Facebook, was met with a stark, unyielding rejection\u2014a cold pronouncement of \"advertising adult products or services,\" a pixelated barrier erected against painted skin. Paul Summer, Mossgreen's chief executive, voiced a profound disbelief, decrying the decision as \"ridiculous,\" a perplexing stumble back to a stifling \"1950s\" morality, insisting, \"This is a very beautiful image that is not overtly sexual in any shape or form,\" a vision unfairly veiled by an unseen, digital hand. \"It's ridiculous to censor this sort of thing,\" he lamented, a cry against the digital age's prudish shadow, an echo of the recent discord where a French teacher faced account suspension for daring to share Gustave Courbet's 19th-century nude, a stark reminder of art's enduring struggle against fleeting online decrees. Facebook, an unyielding arbiter, declared its judgment final, its digital message speaking of \"negative user sentiment\" and a \"zero tolerance towards such advertisements,\" even as Mossgreen, undeterred, found ways to repost the image, a quiet act of artistic defiance. \"Women Lovers,\" a canvas poised for auction, carried the promise of more than A$45,000, its market value a testament to its artistic merit, yet its public viewing was curtailed by an algorithm's decree. \"Nobody said a single thing until Facebook suddenly decided it was going to offend somebody,\" Mr. Summer mused, bewildered by the platform's sudden guardianship, adding, \"I don't know who they're protecting,\" picturing his own teenage",
        "John le Carr\u00e9\u2019s seminal Cold War espionage novel, *The Spy Who Came In From The Cold*, a narrative acutely situated amidst the geopolitical tensions of the Cold War, is slated for adaptation by the critically acclaimed and Oscar-winning screenwriter Simon Beaufoy, renowned for his work on *Slumdog Millionaire*. The narrative meticulously charts the descent of Alec Leamas, a British intelligence officer whose operational efficacy has been severely compromised, reflecting a network in East Berlin that lies in profound disarray. Le Carr\u00e9 himself expressed considerable enthusiasm for this forthcoming production, slated to premiere on BBC One. This adaptation signifies a continuation of the successful co-production model established between the BBC and the US network AMC, building upon their critically acclaimed collaborative effort for *The Night Manager*. The preceding collaboration garnered significant industry accolades, with Tom Hiddleston, Hugh Laurie, and Olivia Colman each securing Golden Globe awards for their performances, and the series itself receiving a nomination for Best Mini-Series or Television Film. *The Spy Who Came In From The Cold* is historically positioned in 1962, a critical period merely months subsequent to the construction of the Berlin Wall, thereby intensifying the geopolitical backdrop. Within this narrative, Leamas's clandestine operatives are depicted as either fugitives or deceased, direct casualties of the formidable East German counter-intelligence officer, Hans-Dieter Mundt. Consequently, Leamas is repatriated to London, where he is presented with a strategic opportunity for retribution. The original novel, published in 1963, was previously adapted into a critically acclaimed feature film in 1965, starring Richard Burton, and Le Carr\u00e9 expressed his keen anticipation for this renewed cinematic interpretation, specifically articulating, \"I'm very excited by the project, and have great confidence in the team.\" Beaufoy, for his part, affirmed the project's significance,",
        "From a boundless trove of children's tales, over 120,421 vivid narratives penned by young minds aged five to thirteen, submitted to the BBC's 500 Words competition, the Oxford University Press drew forth illuminating insights. The digital tide, ever-shifting, now charts a new course in youthful prose, revealing how deeply technology entwines with their lives, yet how swiftly their language around it transforms. Once familiar echoes of 'email' and 'mobile' fade like distant signals, while 'Facebook' recedes from their lexicon's shore. In their stead, a vibrant new dialect blooms: the swift 'Instagram,' the fleeting 'Snapchat,' and the expressive 'emoji,' each a brushstroke on their imaginative canvas. The very 'television' of old now yields its crown to the omnipresent 'phone,' a world held in every palm. Vineeta Gupta at the Oxford University Press noted a significant shift, observing the sudden, striking mark of the hashtag symbol # dancing at sentence's end. No longer merely a prefix or a search's beacon, she explained, \"Children have extended its use from a simple prefix or as a search term for Twitter to an editorial device to add drama or comment,\" sprinkling their narratives with sly asides and bold declarations, painting extra layers of meaning onto their worlds, as if whispering #IblameTwitter #AndInstagram. Other words, like 'iPod,' 'mp3,' and 'Blackberry,' now reside on the technological endangered list, replaced by the gleam of 'iPhone,' the whispers of 'chat app WhatsApp,' and the calls of messaging site 'ooVoo.' #keepup, indeed, as the currents flow. Within these narratives, a new legend unfolds: the quest for sudden internet fame. One of the most common plotlines saw children crafting tales of their own YouTube triumphs, where the heart of the story beat with the rhythm of 'hits,' 'shares,' and 'likes' received, rather than simply watching videos. #makesabetterstory, they instinctively understood, for the spotlight now beckoned to them. Their imaginative realms teemed with a fascinating assembly of characters: the timeless grace of Cinderella, the athletic prowess of footballer Lionel Messi and Wayne Rooney, the dark shadow of Adolf Hitler, and the ethereal beauty of Snow White.

        "The air around Cardiff City was thick with transfer whispers and conflicting reports as the January window swung open. Heracles' 23-year-old forward, Wout Weghorst, had confidently asserted he was on the verge of a move to the Welsh capital, a claim swiftly countered by Bluebirds' boss Russell Slade. While Slade conceded a fleeting interest in the Dutch Under-21 international \"some time ago,\" he adamantly dismissed the current speculation, stating, \"To my knowledge that's not something we're going to pursue.\" Weghorst, who honed his craft at FC Emmen before joining Heracles in 2014 and has also drawn glances from Celtic, seemed at the heart of a Dutch-driven rumour mill. Indeed, Heracles chairman Jam Smit even professed belief that a fee had been amicably agreed upon with Cardiff. However, Slade remained resolute, pinning the origins of \"all the forcing and all the speculation\" firmly on the Netherlands. \"There was an initial inquiry some time ago,\" he reiterated, drawing a firm line under the discussion, \"That's all I can say.\"\n\nAmidst this swirling uncertainty, Slade's own transfer objectives remained clear: up to three strategic signings were targeted to inject fresh impetus into Cardiff's Championship play-off aspirations, with the club currently perched just four points shy of the coveted top six. A new striker was high on the agenda, a void left gaping by the recent departure of last season's prolific scorer, Kenwyne Jones, to Al Jazira in the United Arab Emirates. Jones, via social media, had publicly lamented the club's supposed failure to offer him a new deal, a sentiment Slade firmly disputed. \"I'm pretty sure there was a dialogue going on between Kenwyne's people, Kenwyne himself and [chief executive] Ken Choo and the board of directors,\" he countered, painting a picture of active negotiation rather than neglect. Further fanning the flames of the transfer market, Slade also had to bat away claims from Rotherham Manager Neil Redfearn, who had suggested talks were underway for the return of Alex Revell.

The prospect of alleviating this strain, potentially unburdening the NHS of millions annually, feels like a breath of fresh air for a system constantly under pressure. Yet, a shadow of irony looms as pharmacies themselves, poised to be vital partners, lament that proposed cuts threaten to undermine this very progress, making one question the coherence of strategic planning. This ingenious Sore Throat Test and Treat service, already trialled with encouraging results in 35 Boots pharmacies, promises a swift, definitive answer, discerning whether a pesky illness is the work of a virus \u2013 rendering antibiotics utterly useless \u2013 or a bacterial invader truly requiring intervention. With a simple throat swab, measuring subtle sugar markers on the tongue, clarity arrives in a mere five minutes, a welcome reprieve from anxious waiting. For those few genuinely needing antibiotics, the convenience of a pharmacist\u2019s prescription, bypassing the often-arduous journey to a GP, truly feels like progress. This forward-thinking approach, lauded by NHS chief executive Simon Stevens, is set to sweep across the nation over the coming year, a testament to its perceived efficacy. Dr. Adam Roberts, a microbiologist at University College London and a vigilant guardian against antibiotic resistance, rightly heralded it to the BBC as \"quite an innovative step,\" underscoring its profound implications. His impassioned plea for \"Anything that reduces our reliance and our inappropriate use of antibiotics is a good thing\" resonates deeply with the urgent need to preserve these precious medications. The compelling initial data, revealing that a mere 36 out of approximately 360 participants received a prescription \u2013 a truly \"massive reduction\" \u2013 speaks volumes about its potential to halt the thoughtless over-prescription that has plagued modern medicine. Claire Ward, chairwoman of Pharmacy Voice, representing the sector, warmly embraced the roll-out, expressing what many feel: that this is precisely \"the kind of thing community pharmacies should be undertaking,\" a natural evolution of their role. Yet, her warning, stark and sobering, that cuts to vital services could tragically undermine the scheme's very foundations, highlights",
        "So, there's this volcano, Sakurajima, over on Japan's Kyushu island, and researchers from the University of Bristol are issuing a pretty stark warning: they say it poses a \"growing threat.\" Now, this isn't just any volcano; it's quite literally on the doorstep of danger, situated a mere 49 kilometers from the Sendai nuclear plant. And even closer, it looms over Kagoshima, a bustling city home to some 600,000 people. We're talking about a volcano with a deadly past, too; its last major eruption, back in 1914, tragically claimed the lives of 58 individuals. Of course, Japan, sitting right on the Pacific's notorious \"Ring of Fire,\" is no stranger to volcanoes, boasting well over a hundred of them. Sakurajima itself is a constant reminder of this geological activity, regularly belching ash into the sky and experiencing numerous small explosions throughout the year\u2014in fact, its latest eruption was just this past February. Consequently, it's under intense scrutiny by Japanese authorities, holding a Level 3 designation on their five-level volcanic warning system. That's a serious alert, meaning people are explicitly warned to stay clear of the volcano's immediate vicinity.\n\nBut here's where the new, truly alarming information comes in. Dr. James Hickey, who led this study while at Bristol and is now with the University of Exeter's Camborne School of Mines, explained the gravity of their findings. He noted that the 1914 eruption was massive, expelling about 1.5 cubic kilometers of material. And based on their data, they estimate it takes roughly 130 years for Sakurajima to accumulate enough magma for an eruption of that scale again. The chilling part? We're now only about 25 years away from that predicted threshold. This crucial report on the volcano's activity was unveiled just this Tuesday, the result of collaborative efforts between teams from Bristol University and the Sakurajima Volcano Research Centre. Their research painted a vivid picture: an astonishing 14 million cubic meters of magma is accumulating beneath the volcano every single year. To put that into perspective, that's enough to fill London's iconic Wembley Stadium three and a half times over, year after year. What's more, they found that this rate of accumulation is actually *faster* than the volcano can expel material through its regular, smaller eruptions. This led them to a stark conclusion: a major eruption is not just possible, but *likely* within the next three decades. These"
