        "Maj Richard Scott, 40, is accused of driving at speeds of up to 95mph (153km/h) in bad weather before the smash on a B-road in Wiltshire. Gareth Hicks, 24, suffered fatal injuries when the van he was asleep in was hit by Mr Scott's Audi A6. Maj Scott denies a charge of causing death by careless driving. Prosecutor Charles Gabb alleged the defendant, from Green Lane in Shepperton, Surrey, had crossed the carriageway of the 60mph-limit B390 in Shrewton near Amesbury. The weather was \"awful\" and there was strong wind and rain, he told jurors. He said Mr Scott's car was described as \"twitching\" and \"may have been aquaplaning\" before striking the first vehicle; a BMW driven by Craig Reed. Mr Scott's Audi then returned to his side of the road but crossed the carriageway again before colliding head-on with a Ford Transit van in which Mr Hicks was a passenger, the court was told. \"There is no doubt that when the Audi smashed into the panel van he was on completely the wrong side of the road,\" Mr Gabb said. Mr Hicks, from Bath in Somerset, was asleep in the van being driven to a construction site in Salisbury by fellow DR Groundworks colleague, Patrick Gilleece. The jury was told the Maj Scott suffered \"substantial injuries\" and could not recall the crash, which happened shortly after 07:00 GMT on 6 October, 2014. He does not accept the charge and suggests it was in fact Mr Reed who had crossed the carriageway, causing the collision, Mr Gabb told the court. The trial",
        "The ban was backed by local authorities in Urumqi, state media reported. The move is the latest in a campaign against Islamic clothing and symbols in the mainly Muslim region. China's government has blamed Uighur militants for several recent attacks - but activists say the violence has been fuelled by Chinese repression. The Uighurs traditionally practice a moderate form of Islam. Recently, though, the influence of stricter forms of the faith from the Gulf and Pakistan has led to more women covering their faces. According to the BBC's Asia Pacific editor, Charles Scanlon, the Chinese authorities regard wearing an Islamic face veil as an act of defiance at a time of growing violence in the region. In August this year, the northern city of Karamay banned men with long beards from boarding buses. Some experts believe such restrictions could backfire at a time when many Uighurs believe their culture is under attack. James Leibold, an expert on China's ethnic policy at Melbourne's La Trobe University, told Reuters news agency that the ban on the veils would make them \"more popular as a symbol of resistance and assertion of ethno-national identity\". He is quoted as saying that China's Communist party had made a direct link between certain Islamic dress styles and religious extremism. The law passed in Urumqi is set to come into force after it has been approved by a regional body. China's authorities have attributed a wave of recent violence, some of which has targeted civilians in public places, to Uighur militants inspired or aided by overseas terror groups. It has launched a crackdown in the region, arresting and jailing scores of people. But Uighur activists say that China's strong-arm",
        "Palmer expects to be fined by the British Horseracing Authority (BHA) for the rule breach during Champions Day. \"It was an oversight,\" Palmer told BBC Sport. \"The wrong kit box was left in the lorry and taken to the stables.\" The Newmarket-based trainer saw Galilieo Gold finish fifth in the Group One Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot. Horses are only allowed to receive hay-feed or water before a race, but other substances such as electrolytes are permitted post-race. Employees of Palmer and fellow trainers, Francois Rohaut and and Jean-Claude Rouget, as well as the trainers themselves, were interviewed by stewards following a report by the Equine Welfare and Integrity Officer. Palmer is yet to hear what punishment the BHA will hand down. \"I imagine there will be a routine fine for a rule that's been broken,\" he told BBC Radio Berkshire. \"There's no suggestion that anyone was trying to seek an advantage or cheat. It's simply what the rule says. The rules are the rules and you need to stick to them.\" BHA media spokesman Robin Mounsey said: \"Of the substances, three are electrolytes which are permitted in the stables but they just failed to clear it beforehand, while the other substance is permitted in training but just not on a race day.\" All the horses involved, Signs Of Blessing, Architecture, Galileo Gold, and Almanzor - winner of the Champion Stakes - were routine tested. Meanwhile, Palmer has confirmed Galileo Gold will race on next season and the four-year-old will stay in training. \"Horses like him are incredibly hard to find,\" he added.",
        "Regina Hungerford, 56, denied striking a 17-year-old as he listened to music in her class at Merthyr Tydfil College. But a disciplinary panel ruled contact with the pupil was probably made and her conduct had been \"unacceptable\". On Thursday, the Education Workforce Council imposed the suspension, saying: \"The public interest is in favour of her being able to teach again.\" Mrs Hungerford admitted shouting and slamming a book on the desk of the \"provocative and disruptive\" teenager as he listened to rap music in her classroom - but always denied hitting his head. She was cleared, on appeal, of a criminal charge for assaulting the pupil during a maths lesson for those with learning difficulties. But in November, a disciplinary panel found, on the balance of probabilities, she had made physical conduct with the pupil on the head or hand. The panel found she had \"acted in an inappropriate way\" and ruled it was professional misconduct. During the hearing, the mother-of-three pleaded to save her \"very rewarding\" career. She told how the allegations had \"ruined her life\", calling it a \"miscarriage of justice\", but said she wanted to continue teaching. On Thursday, Mrs Hungerford was told she would be suspended from the teaching register for four months, but she will be allowed to return after taking a behaviour-management course. Panel chairman Gareth Roberts said it was the appropriate sanction to \"allow her to return to teaching within a short period of time\". He said: \"The public interest is in favour of her being able to teach again.\"",

DUP leader Arlene Foster said Mrs O'Neill was wrong to attend, but was not surprised. However, Mrs O'Neill has defended her decision to speak at the event. She said:\"There are some who would say we have no right to remember or to honour them, we have absolutely every right. \"Everyone, it doesn't matter who you are, has the right to remember their dead in a respectful and dignified manner.\" The four IRA men were shot dead after attacking Coalisland police station. Soldiers opened fire on them as they dumped a lorry used in the machine-gun attack in February 1992. The Ulster Unionist Party's Mid Ulster candidate, Sandra Overend, has criticised Mrs O'Neill for attending the event. \"It is only to be expected that republicans would wish to remember their dead, but Michelle O'Neill's presence at such an event is hardly sending a signal to the unionist community that she is some kind of new departure for Sinn Fein,\" she said. An Alliance Party spokesperson said: \"While people will naturally want to mark those who died during the Troubles, it is important in doing so, the focus is on healing wounds, reconciliation and not glamorising violence. We need to avoid using the past as a political weapon, instead focusing on healing and reconciliation.\" SDLP justice spokesperson Alex Attwood said: \"The fundamental roadblock to justice, truth and accountability is the fact that some want to address the past on their own terms and not the terms required by victims and survivors. \"That is what is getting in the way and one of the big reasons why legacy is not being dealt with decisively and ethically.",
        "Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) said the force had \"fragile\" staffing levels and needed to \"implement improvement plans rapidly\". Inspectors visited the force after criticising its response to government spending cuts last year. Police and Crime Commissioner Olly Martins said the report was \"out of date\". In the HMIC's Policing in Austerity: Meeting the Challenge report last year, Bedfordshire Police was judged to be \"requiring improvement\". Inspectors, who said the force would be \"monitored closely\", returned in October and found it was not performing well compared to similar forces. It highlighted problems in the force control room, although said these should be improved by a recent increase in staff. The report described staffing levels as \"fragile but improving\" and said although there had been recruitment, it was not clear what investment the force had made in preventive work to reduce demand. \"There is a concern that it may not be tackling longer-term issues,\" the report said. Inspectors said it needed to implement its plans for improving policing in \"an affordable way more quickly\" while ensuring its service \"remains effective\". However, they said the force was \"moving in the right direction and the pace of change is increasing\". Mr Martins said: \"All that publishing out-of-date snapshots of a force, such as today's report does, is potentially undermine police force morale and mislead the public. \"When HMIC have already made their subsequent inspection it frankly seems incompetent, to say the least, to still publish a report that's seven months out of date.\" HMIC said it had made a further assessment in March and would be returning in May and July.",
        "Their first stop on a busy day of public engagements was a tour of the Giant's Causeway in County Antrim. The Unesco World Heritage Site is made up of some 40,000 large black basalt columns which protrude from the sea. It was the Royal couple's first visit to Northern Ireland's best known tourist attraction. The causeway formed when molten rock was forced up through fissures in the earth to form a lava plateau. The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh then travelled to the nearby village of Bushmills to commemorate local soldier Robert Quigg. He won a Victoria Cross for bravery during the Battle of the Somme. Sgt Quigg was given the highest military award for valour after going out into the line of fire to search for his commanding officer. The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh unveiled a statue of the soldier as well as a commemorative stone. His grandnephew, Leonard Quigg, also gave a short address. From there, the Royal couple moved on to a reception at Portrush Golf Club as guests of the mayor for the Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council. Afterwards, they took a journey back in time as they travelled on a steam train from Coleraine, County Londonderry, to the village of Bellarena. Large crowds gathered in Coleraine to greet the couple as they boarded the five-carriage train, built in 1932. The Royal guests were accompanied by local schoolchildren as they travelled to Bellarena, where the Queen officially opened the village's new train station. The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh first made the same journey along the historic Coleraine to Londonderry railway line in 1953 - the year of her coronation. The original station had opened a century earlier in 1853. Earlier this year, two new railway platforms opened in Bellarena, as part of a \u00c2\u00a346m upgrade to the Coleraine to Londonderry railway line. On her arrival in the village, the Queen unveiled a plaque marking the new development. Wellwishers lined the route, waving union flags and cheering. On Monday, the Royal visitor met Northern Ireland's first and deputy first ministers at Hillsborough Castle in County Down. The trip is the third high-profile royal visit to Northern Ireland in weeks and follows",
        "The Institute of Public Policy Research (IPPR) said London's poorest children outperformed those in the north. The report is being launched by the centre-left think tank in Sheffield. The government said extra funds were being given to early years providers to help children from poorer backgrounds and close the attainment gap. The report has also detailed a number of \"tests\" or benchmarks for the government's northern powerhouse scheme. Research by the IPPR showed only 47% of children born in the poorest families in the north of England achieved a good level of early years development compared with 59% in London. Its survey also found five northern city-regions combined had almost as many well-qualified individuals (3.6 million) as London (3.7 million) - but the IPPR forecasts demand for skilled workers in the North is set to increase. The IPPR has proposed 11 benchmarks for Chancellor George Osborne's flagship policy to boost regional economies, including closing the \"stark\" gap in the development of children aged under five. IPPR's director Ed Cox said: \"We will never become a powerhouse economy when our children and young people have such a poor start in life. \"It will take a generation of investment - not only in new railways and motorways, but in the 'human capital' of the north - in education and training, starting with the youngest. \"If the Northern Powerhouse is to be successful, economic powers must be devolved to all corners of the North to allow businesses and policymakers to develop an economy that supports more productive, resilient and sustainable growth: jobs that pay well, prosperity that is shared, and opportunities for all.\" The Department for Education said it was committed to ensuring every child, regardless of background, could fulfil their potential. It said reforms had meant there were 250,000 more pupils in good or outstanding schools in the north since 2010.",

He doesn't want to be treated like that,\" Mallinder said. \"All George wants to do is get back and play rugby.\" The Wales international previously had a six-month spell out of the game after suffering a series of blows to the head during matches, including a serious concussion when scoring a try against Wasps in March 2015.

If he thought he had been concussed, then George is sensible enough to put his hand up and say 'I'm concussed and I need some time out of the game'. \"He went to see the specialist on Tuesday, who backed up that he hasn't got any symptoms. But because he may have been knocked unconscious, we must treat it as a concussive episode and therefore we will not play him for a couple of weeks.\" A concussion review group was formed to investigate how North's case was handled and whether the club have a",
        "Seamer Abbott, 29, and top-order batsman Rossouw, 27, confirmed their international retirements in January. Rossouw, in his first season in county cricket, refused to say if his hand had been forced by Cricket South Africa. \"Maybe, maybe not,\" he told BBC Sport. \"I think that story is one I'm going to tell at a different time.\" Kolpak contracts allow sportsmen from countries with associate trade agreements with the European Union to be afforded the same right to free movement as EU citizens. They are not classed as overseas players under the terms of their contracts, but they become ineligible to represent their country at international level. Abbott and Rossouw's decisions came before Britain's exit from the European Union and they are among several South Africans to make the switch ahead of the new domestic season. Among the others, all-rounder Simon Harmer has joined Essex,Stiaan van Zyl and David Wiese have moved to Sussex and fast bowler Hardus Viljoen will line up for Derbyshire. \"Right now, I'm just going to enjoy life here in England,\" Rossouw said, as he prepares to start a three-year contract with Hampshire. \"I'm enthusiastic about the season. I'm 100% clean cut on my decision and I don't think that's going to change any time soon. \"Right now, my home is in England and I want to be here beyond the next three years for Hampshire.\" For Abbott, a four-year deal marks a return to the county he last played for as an overseas signing in 2014. \"I made a lot of friends here during my last spell and it just felt like the right place for me,\" the right-arm pace bowler said. Abbott broke down in tears when he announced his international retirement after helping South Africa to a home series win against Sri Lanka, but said at Hampshire's pre-season media day that he had come to terms with his reasons for doing so long before it was confirmed. \"I've been comfortable for a long time to be honest,\" he added. \"I've always felt like Hampshire was a home for me. It was a pretty easy transition across here.\"",
        "Stephen Parnaby, Conservative leader of East Riding of Yorkshire Council, said the announcement was \"great news for the town and the wider East Riding\". The authority said it was spending about \u00a3100,000 on hosting the event. The organisers of last year's inaugural race said it brought \u00a350m into the region's economy. The three-day event was launched by tourist body Welcome to Yorkshire after the county hosted the Tour de France Grand Depart in 2014. More than 1.2m people lined the 320-mile (515km) route. Mr Parnaby said last year's event had attracted thousands of spectators to the East Riding. \"The council feels that the investment made by the authority, circa \u00a3100,000, to bring part of the race here is money well spent and will provide opportunities for local traders to capitalise on increased spending and help boost the East Riding economy,\" he said. Others in Beverley have also welcomed the race's arrival. Local amateur cyclist Ed Neilson said he hoped having the start of the race would encourage other cyclists to visit the town. \"It's nice to see Beverley getting some recognition,\" he said. \"I think that a few people felt it missed out a little last year, because it wasn't shown on the telly.\" Garry Payne, who owns a cycling cafe, said it was \"fantastic news\" for fans that they would get a chance to get up close to the riders. He said: \"It's so colourful and the riders will be signing autographs, and they're a lot more accessible than what it was last year when they literally whizzed by in the flash of an eye.\"",
        "The doctors' union had refused to sit down and talk about improving patient care and had spread \"misinformation\", he told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. Mr Hunt wants to change junior doctors' contracts, which he says are \"unfair\". The BMA said its door was open to talks and blamed the strikes on Mr Hunt's \"shambolic mishandling\" of the matter. The dispute, which began in 2014 and centres around pay and weekend working, has led to strikes being held across England. The next is a 24-hour strike planned for Wednesday, when emergency care will only be provided from 08:00 GMT. Asking by Marr about low morale among junior doctors, Mr Hunt said: \"One of the reasons for that anger is that they were told by the BMA that their pay was going to be cut - it isn't. \"They were told that they were going to be asked to work longer hours - they aren't,\" he added. \"We are actually bringing down the hours that they work. And if you are told by your union that the health secretary wants to do these awful things - of course you are going to feel devalued.\" BMA junior doctor committee chairman Dr Johann Malawana said Mr Hunt was threatening to impose a contract that junior doctors had \"roundly rejected\". \"Junior doctors already work around the clock, seven days a week, and they do so under their existing contract,\" he said. \"If the government want more seven-day services then, quite simply, they need more doctors, nurses and diagnostic staff, and the extra investment needed to deliver it.\" He went on to say the health secretary risked \"alienating a generation of junior doctors and undermining the delivery of future patient care\". Shadow health secretary Heidi Alexander said Mr Hunt was \"insulting the intelligence\" of junior doctors.",

As the South Korean company scrambles to contain the crisis, we look back at the developments so far: 2 August: Samsung unveils its latest flagship model Galaxy Note 7 amid great fanfare in New York. The phone is packed with new features like an iris scanner. The initial response is good and expectations high. It's seen as Samsung's big rival to the upcoming iPhone 7. 19 August: Sales start in 10 markets, including South Korea and the United States. European markets are scheduled for October. 24 August: The first report of a Note 7 device \"exploding\" appear in the news. It isn't long before there are more incidents with users posting pictures and videos of what they say are their phones overheating, exploding or catching fire. 2 September: Samsung announces a voluntary global recall of some 2.5 million Note 7 phones, citing faulty batteries. The company offers to either refund or replace the device. 8 September: US federal aviation administration and numerous airlines worldwide tell passengers not to turn on or charge the Note 7 while on a plane. 9 September: The US Consumer Product Safety Commission urges people to stop using the phone and on 15 September, issues a formal recall. Meanwhile, Samsung announced it will resume selling the Note 7 on 28 September in South Korea 19 September: Reports appear of phones in China catching fire as well although Samsung said the batteries for the devices sold in China were from a different supplier and not affected by the recall. 1 October: Samsung resumes sales of the Note 7 in South Korea. In the US, the replacement of phone is in full swing. 6 October: There's the first report of a replacement Note 7 still showing the same problems. A phone on board a Southwest Airline flight in the US starts emitting smoke and the plane get evacuated.

        "The removal of the engines, which have lain idle for two years, would leave 142 active vehicles in the capital. Savings from the proposal would be invested in making more staff available to crew Fire Rescue Units. But the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) said it would be \"dangerous and reckless\" to get rid of them permanently. The London Fire Brigade (LFB) has released three plans to make the savings. It insists no stations will close and no firefighters will be forced to leave their jobs. The Brigade said it had continued to meet London-wide attendance time targets while the 13 engines had been out of service. It said that bringing them back would improve response times by about four seconds for the first engine to reach the scene. An alternative proposal has been put forward by London Assembly Member Andrew Dismore, who recommends putting the 13 fire engines back into service but making savings by establishing alternate crewing at stations with some specialist appliances. The proposals will be discussed on 2 December and there will be a full public consultation on how the Brigade will find the savings, LFB said. The FBU said it was \"opposed to the removal of any fire engine from London.\" A spokesman said: \"In wake of the Paris attacks, it would be dangerous and reckless to reduce the number of fire engines and we would urge the London Fire Brigade to think again. \"The ten fire stations that were closed last year increased response times. By removing these fire engines, we fear that response times could increase again.\"",

The false message said: \"Breaking: Two Explosions in the White House and Barack Obama is injured.\" US markets were spooked by the tweet; the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 150 points as it was retweeted. On Tuesday evening, the FBI said it was investigating the incident. White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters soon after the tweet was published that President Obama was fine, and financial markets quickly recovered the lost ground. AP said later: \"The @AP twitter account has been hacked. The tweet about an attack at the White House is false.\" The account was back online on Wednesday. The agency said the attack came after repeated attempts by hackers to steal the passwords of AP journalists, adding that it was working to correct the issue. Spokesman Paul Colford said the wire service had disabled other Twitter accounts following the attack and was working with the microblogging site to investigate the breach. AP reporter Mike Baker tweeted: \"The @AP hack came less than an hour after some of us received an impressively disguised phishing email.\" The phishing email in question appeared to come from the email account of another AP staffer, with a request to click a link to a \"very important\" article on the Washington Post website. The link opened a bogus login page requesting users enter their staff ID and password, reports suggest. A group claiming to support Syrian President Bashar al-Assad took responsibility for the attacks, tweeting: \"Ops! @AP get owned by Syrian Electronic Army! #SEA #Syria #ByeByeObama.\" The Syrian Electronic Army claims to have been behind similar attacks on the twitter feeds of Agence France Presse news agency, Sky News Arabia, al-Jazeera mobile and CBS News.

        "In a statement, it said Foreign Affairs Secretary Perfecto Yasay would raise the issue at a major two-day Asia-Europe summit starting on Friday, attended by China's Premier Li Keqiang. A UN-backed tribunal ruled on Tuesday that there was no legal basis to China's claims in the South China Sea. China has vowed to ignore the ruling. It says the panel has no jurisdiction and its activities in the region will not be affected. The Asia-Europe Meeting Summit (Asem) in Ulaanbaatar in Mongolia on Friday and Saturday will be the first major multilateral diplomatic gathering since the 12 July ruling over the South China Sea. The summit will see 53 leaders from Asia and Europe attending, including from countries such as Vietnam and Malaysia which also claim territory in the region. It will also be the first meeting in which the new Philippine government of President Rodrigo Duterte will be represented on the world stage. The Department of Foreign Affairs said Mr Yasay, representing Mr Duterte, would \"discuss within the context of Asem's agenda the Philippines' peaceful and rules-based approach on the South China Sea and the need for parties to respect the recent decision\". It is the strongest statement yet from the Philippines on the ruling. Mr Duterte has adopted a more conciliatory approach than his predecessor Benigno Aquino, saying the Philippines would be willing to share natural resources with China in contested areas if the tribunal ruled in its favour. It initially welcomed the ruling as a \"milestone decision\", but without outright celebration. China, which claims almost all of the South China Sea, has said the summit is \"not a suitable place to discuss\" the issue. \"It should not be put on the agenda,\" Assistant Foreign Minister Kong Xuanyou told Reuters. Tuesday's ruling came from an arbitration tribunal brought by the Philippines under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which both countries have signed. It said China had violated the Philippines' sovereign rights and caused \"severe harm to the coral reef environment\" by building artificial islands. The ruling is binding but the Permanent Court of Arbitration has no powers",

He said they had been determined that day-to-day politics would not interfere with showing Wales working together. More than 60 world leaders, 4,000 delegates and 1,500 journalists have spent two days at the Celtic Manor Resort for the one of the biggest ever international gatherings ever to be held in the UK. Mr Crabb said: \"We wanted it to be an opportunity to show the world the very best of Wales in terms of hospitality, quality of infrastructure and facilities. I believe this week has shown exactly that. \"We've been clear that this Nato summit needs to have a lasting economic impact for Wales. I believe the global profile of Wales this week will help that. \"And with the investment summit we're organising on the back of the Nato summit, we're determined it will bring more inward investment. \"Bringing world leaders, prime ministers and ambassadors here this week has all been part of that plan.\" The UK Investment Summit, on 20 and 21 November, will also be held at the Celtic Manor. US President Barack Obama voiced his approval for the warm Welsh welcome on Thursday, praising the country for its \"extraordinary beauty, wonderful people, and great hospitality.\" Despite hopes of long-term benefits to Wales, traders in the centre of Cardiff have complained that security barriers and road closures hit their businesses hard by deterring customers in the run-up to the summit and during the event. First Minister Carwyn Jones paid tribute to residents and businesses for their support for the summit and \"tolerance of some inevitable disruption\". \"What a fantastic week this has been for Wales,\" he said. \"President Obama himself gave us the biggest endorsement, praising the extraordinary beauty, wonderful people and great hospitality of our country and saying he would encourage people from the United States to visit here. \"The next step is to ensure we keep this momentum going.\" Cardiff council promised that security barriers in the centre of the city would be taken down by Sunday afternoon.

President Jonathan was among those unable to cast his vote using the technology, which was introduced to prevent fraud. His Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), who had opposed the card readers, called it a \"huge national embarrassment\". The Inec chair, Attahiru Jega, stressed that only a fraction of the 150,000 card readers being used nationwide had failed.

A statement from Mr Stewart's family said: \"Our family would like to extend our love and thoughts to the families involved at this very sad and tragic time. \"Sincere gratitude and appreciation goes out to all the services involved in the rescue efforts and hospital staff at Dumfries and Galloway Royal Infirmary.\" The men failed to return from a walk in the hills at Durisdeer on Tuesday. Sixteen members of Moffat Mountain Rescue team (MRT) and two search and rescue dogs combed the hills for the men until the early hours of Wednesday. However the search was stood down amid heavy rain, snow, high winds and poor visibility. When it resumed at 08:30 on Wednesday, more than 50 people were involved in the search, including neighbouring mountain rescue teams and a Coastguard helicopter. The men were found that afternoon and taken by helicopter to the hospital in Dumfries. Police said Mr Crosbie died shortly afterwards and his walking partners were treated for hypothermia. Colin Golphin, Moffat MRT leader, said: \"The weather, although OK during the day, deteriorated rapidly overnight. \"The team searched the hills during the night in extremely poor conditions. \"Our condolences are with the family of the walkers who died.\" The experienced walkers were said to be regular visitors to the Lowther Hills and were familiar with the area.",
        "Unemployment fell to 1.69 million between January and March, down 2,000 from the previous quarter. The jobless rate remained at 5.1%, the ONS said. There were 31.58 million people in work, up 44,000 from the previous quarter. That took the employment rate to a record high of 74.2%. But the number of job vacancies dropped by 18,000 to 745,000, the ONS added, marking the first fall for almost a year. David Freeman, a senior statistician at the ONS, said: \"The employment rate has hit another record high, but this time the increase is quite modest. \"With unemployment very little changed, that is further evidence the jobs market could be cooling off.\" Average earnings including bonuses rose 2% from a year earlier, up from 1.9% in the three months to February. The ONS said the timing of bonuses this year had affected the rise in total earnings. Excluding bonuses, earnings rose by 2.1% year-on-year in the three months to March, down from 2.2% in the three months to February. The number of people claiming jobless benefits fell by 2,400 in April to 737,800, although revised data showed the figure rose by 14,700 between February and March, the largest increase since autumn 2011. The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Stephen Crabb, said: \"These are another record-breaking set of figures, with more people in work than ever before and the unemployment rate is the lowest in a decade at 5.1%.\" But economists were less upbeat. David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, said that despite the UK employment rate reaching a record high, \"the cumulative picture - including manufacturing, trade and GDP figures - points to a softening in economic activity\". Paul Hollingsworth, UK economist at Capital Economics, said: \"Although there were some bright spots in today's UK labour market figures, on the whole they offered a further indication that the economic slowdown has sapped the jobs recovery of its recent vigour.\" However, Martin Beck, senior economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said: \"With the unemployment rate back to the pre-crisis average... it would be unrealistic to expect the rapid drops in unemployment seen in 2015 to continue indefinitely.\"",
        "Taibu, 32, played 28 Test matches and 150 one-day internationals for Zimbabwe prior to retiring in 2012. \"When he explained who he was I thought it was a hoax,\" Hightown publicity officer Nick Gordon said. \"The conversation developed, we got references from people in the game in Zimbabwe and we've talked ever since. It's a real coup for us.\" The wicketkeeper-batsman could make his debut for the Second Division side when they play Alder on 24 April. Speaking to BBC Radio Merseyside, Gordon said Taibu approached the club after they had advertised for an overseas player for the summer. \"It's not every day that a club like Hightown St Mary's signs a player like Tatenda,\" Gordon said. \"I had to do a double take, it was so unusual. We put out an advert for young players but he said 'I'm not a young player, I'm a retired Test cricketer.' \"This guy has played at an incredibly high standard of cricket and we are happy to take the risk. Even if he hasn't picked up a bat since 2012, he will be more than sufficient for our needs this summer.\" Signing the former international, who scored 1546 runs in 28 Test matches, also came as a shock to Hightown's players as well as their rivals. \"It was utter disbelief at the beginning,\" Gordon explained. \"The players thought it was a wind-up but, over time, people are excited about him coming over. It's not every day we get this opportunity at club level. \"There's certainly some envious eyes - I've seen some comments on Twitter asking how on earth we pulled it off. But",
        "The hashtag #penuriecarburantdansunfilm, which translates as \"fuel shortage in a film\", became France's top Twitter trend on Tuesday, with more than 5,000 tweets. A strike over new labour laws is now affecting all of France's eight oil refineries. An estimated 20% of petrol stations have either run dry or are low on supplies. In their posts, French social media users talk about films such as Total Recall, the title of both a 1990 and 2012 science fiction film. Total is also the name of a French multinational oil and gas company. Some users also changed film titles to reflect the shortage: Pulp Fiction was renamed Pump Friction, The Full Monty became The Fuel Monty and Mad Max: Fury Bicycle Lane replaced Mad Max: Fury Road. American actor Vin Diesel's surname and his Hollywood blockbusters attracted particular attention, with people inventing several titles for his Fast and Furious series: Last and Furious, Pas Fast Mais Furious (translation: Not Fast But Furious), Immobile and Furious and Fuel Furious. Others renamed 8 Mile, a semi-biographical drama staring US rapper Eminem, 0 Mile and 8 Miles a Pied (translation: 8 Miles on Foot). American director Stanley Kubrick appeared to inspire people who posted about Fuel Metal Jacket, referring to Kubrick's 1987 film Full Metal Jacket. 2001, l'Odyssee de l'espace is the French title of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. But Espace is also the name of minivan built by French car manufacturer Renault. Pictures of people filling jerrycans at petrol stations led people to incorporate the term into film titles. Tom and Jerrrycan, Jerrycan Beauty and Catch Me If You Jerrycan were the result. Another obvious target was Nicolas Winding Refn's 2011",
        "Among them was a 17-year-old stopped at Sydney airport a fortnight ago, said Immigration Minister Peter Dutton. Mr Dutton said there was a \"growing threat\" from Australians attempting to join groups like Islamic State (IS). Special anti-terror teams were installed in Australia's eight international airports in August. The teenager, who was on his way to the conflict in the Middle East, was returned to the custody of his parents while investigations continued, said Mr Dutton. The interception came about a week after two Sydney brothers, aged 16 and 17, were stopped at the same airport on suspicion of attempting to join IS. The brothers, who have not been named, were also returned to their parents. According to Australian media reports, the two students have been allowed to resume their studies at a prestigious Sydney high school, despite concerns being raised by some parents of other students at the school. 'Trophy paraded online' Australia's anti-terrorism units have spoken to 85,000 people at airports around the country since August, said Mr Dutton. Australia estimates that about 90 of its citizens have already travelled to Iraq or Syria to fight with IS and 20 have been killed in the conflict. There are unconfirmed reports that Melbourne teenager Jake Bilardi carried out a suicide attack in Syria earlier this month after joining IS. His father, John Bilardi, said in an interview with Australia's 60 Minutes, that his son was a \"loner\" who had a \"death wish\" and had been treated as a \"prize\" by IS. \"He was a trophy that they paraded online. They gloated about how they had recruited this young boy who didn't even have a Muslim background,\" said Mr Bilardi. It is a criminal offence in Australia for citizens to set foot in the IS strongholds of Mosul and Raqqa without a legitimate reason such as a visit to family. Any Australian who travels to the cities could face 10 years in prison.",
        "The amnesty applies to offences committed during the political turmoil after Mr Thaksin was ousted in a coup. The lower house passed the controversial bill in the early hours of Friday. It now goes to the Senate. The opposition Democrat Party has warned that the passage of the bill will trigger street protests. It did not take part in the vote, but the bill passed by 310 votes to 0. The bill's passage through the Senate is less certain, reports the BBC South East Asia correspondent Jonathan Head, as half its members are appointed. But this could happen as early as next week and would almost certainly provoke further protests. Advocates of the bill say it will draw a line under the political turmoil that resulted from the military coup in 2006 that removed Mr Thaksin from power, leaving Thailand bitterly divided. This turmoil included the occupation of Bangkok's main airport in 2008 and then two months of street protests in Bangkok in 2010 that left about 90 people - mostly civilian protesters - dead. But critics say the amnesty would allow human rights abuses to go unpunished. \"The proposed amnesty would allow officials and protest leaders who have blood on their hands to go unpunished,\" said Brad Adams, Asia director of Human Rights Watch, on 21 October. \"By whitewashing past abuses, the government denies justice to victims and tells future abusers they have little to fear.\" The opposition believes the bill is aimed at facilitating Mr Thaksin's return, without having to serve a jail sentence. Thaksin Shinawatra has lived in self-imposed overseas exile since being convicted of corruption in 2008, charges he says are politically motivated. The amnesty - initially limited to ordinary protesters charged over involvement in past street clashes - was suddenly expanded two weeks ago to include anyone investigated by agencies set up after the 2006 coup. It was as a result of one of those investigations that Mr Thaksin was jailed, our correspondent reports. In the wake of the coup Mr Thaksin remained popular with rural voters and both general elections since the polls have seen parties allied to him elected. His sister Yingluck Shinawatra is currently the prime minister. The opposition says it plans to challenge the legislation. \"We will continue our fighting in the street until the bill is aborted. There are other avenues such as by petitioning the Constitutional Court,\" said Democrat Party spokesman Chavanond Intarakomalyasut.",
        "Over the next few years Forest Enterprise Scotland will plant them around Loch Trool and the Cree Valley. It is hoped the acorns should help to grow about 600,000 young trees creating a \"large and vibrant habitat\". Environment forester Gareth Ventress said that as soon as they had seen they were in for a \"bumper crop\" of acorns they began planning to collect them. \"We also decided to get help from other staff throughout Scotland and asked them to collect acorns from other native oak woods found on the national forest estate,\" he said. \"The Cree Valley Community Woodland Trust, Borders Forest Trust and Moffat Community Woodlands all assisted in the big collection too in order to further native woodland expansion across their project areas in south Scotland. \"By combining acorns collected from across Galloway Forest Park, we increase the genetic diversity of the trees linking the remnant woodlands. \"This is vital for creating robust and resilient woodlands that can handle pests and diseases well into the future.\" The acorns are collected by laying huge felt nets across the forest floor in order to keep them off the soil and make collection easier. Once the acorns are collected they are sorted then stored. Over the next three to four years the acorn seeds will be germinated and grown so that saplings can then be planted but many of the seeds will be \"graded\" out and deemed infertile during this period. About 600,000 saplings are estimated to be likely to be produced from the acorns. These young trees will",
        "Mr Carney said long-term financing of green projects in emerging markets would promote financial stability. Speaking at an event in Berlin, he urged Germany to use its G20 presidency in 2017 to make progress. Mr Carney has previously warned of climate change risks for the finance industry. At the event on Thursday, Mr Carney said that in theory capital should flow from advanced to emerging economies due to high returns. In practice, however, the opposite has happened - and this has driven down bond yields in advanced economies, he said. When money has sporadically flowed to emerging economies it has had a destabilising influence, he said. \"In this context, green finance is a major opportunity. By ensuring that capital flows finance long-term projects in countries where growth is most carbon intensive, financial stability can be promoted,\" he said. Mr Carney said the issuance of green bonds - for example, to help finance water or renewable power projects aimed at reducing carbon emissions - could double in 2016 from last year's $42bn. But they still represent only 1% of holdings by global financial institutions, he said. \"The development of this new global asset class is an opportunity to advance a low carbon future while raising global investment and spurring growth,\" he said. He elaborated on a conundrum - that by the time there is a clear economic incentive to act against climate change, it will be too late to do anything about it. A further potential problem he pointed out was that \"too rapid a movement towards a low-carbon economy could materially damage financial stability.\" As part of the transition towards a low-carbon economy, Mr Carney",
        "Gene Palmer is the second prison worker detained over the jail break. Joyce Mitchell has already been charged with aiding the escape. The prisoners, Richard Matt and David Sweat, used power tools to flee the Clinton Correctional Facility. A massive manhunt is still under way to find the pair, both convicted killers. Mr Palmer has been held on bail, after appearing before a judge on charges of promoting prison contraband, tampering with physical evidence, and official misconduct. His lawyer, Andrew Brockway, admitted his client delivered the meat but said he did not know it contained the tools, nor that the prisoners were trying to escape. \"He did pass the hamburger meat. He shouldn't have done it. He apologised for it,'' said Mr Brockway, who added his client plans to plead not guilty. Clinton County District Attorney Andrew Wylie said Ms Mitchell placed hacksaw blades and other tools inside the meat, before Mr Palmer took it to Matt and Sweat, who were interred in a section of the jail where prisoners can cook their own meals. Meanwhile, officers are concentrating their search on a 75 sq mi (194 sq km) area of northern New York state. Police found evidence the two men spent time at a hunting cabin near the prison, and it is believed they may be armed, given how heavily the area is stocked with weaponry. \"They are extremely dangerous, they're cunning,\" said New York State Police Major Charles Guess. \"Why wouldn't they try to arm themselves immediately upon escape?''",
        "The party's election manifesto said a funding floor would only be introduced after a referendum was called. The St David's Day Agreement had said the vote would be an \"expectation\", and Labour Welsh ministers oppose a referendum before a funding deal. Labour accused the Tories of trying to hold them \"over a barrel\". The manifesto states the Conservatives would \"introduce a 'funding floor' to protect Welsh relative funding and provide certainty for the Welsh Government to plan for the future, once it has called a referendum on Income Tax powers in the next Parliament\". But a Welsh Conservative spokeswoman told BBC Wales: \"The St David's Day commitment we made to introduce a funding floor for Wales is firm and clear, and work is already underway at the Treasury and the Wales Office to bring this floor forward. \"The funding floor for Wales is not contingent on an income tax referendum. Our UK manifesto makes clear our expectation that the Welsh Assembly will hold a referendum on income tax raising powers early in the next Parliament. \"More detail of our ambitious plan for Wales will be announced in the Conservative Party Welsh Manifesto which will be launched later this week.\" On Friday, Chancellor George Osborne told BBC Wales the funding floor would be between \u00a3113 and \u00a3116 per head for every \u00a3100 spent in England, the range recommended by economist Gerry Holtham. \u200b Labour has said it would also introduce a floor to the Welsh government's funding, but has not committed to a figure. Reacting to the Conservative manifesto, First Minister Carwyn Jones said: \"A vote for the Tories is a vote for a government that would cost Wales up to \u00a3300m a year. \"A fair funding settlement is either fair or it isn't - you can't impose conditions or try and hold the government over a barrel.\" The Liberal Democrats have said they would commission an independent review of Wales' funding arrangements, with a view to raising the Welsh government's budget. Plaid Cymru wants to see an extra \u00a31.2bn a year given to the Welsh government, claiming it would bring spending into line with Scottish levels. UKIP has said it would like to scrap the existing Barnett formula which determines funding for the four UK nations.",
        "Hibs were hammered 10-1 on aggregate by Bayern Munich, while City lost 3-1 to Eskilstuna United from Sweden. \"I think it is fantastic for Scottish football that we actually have two teams in the Champions League,\" Signeul told BBC Scotland. \"It just shows that what we have done has actually brought us two spots.\" Signeul pointed out that the Netherlands, who will host the Euro 2017 finals and play Scotland in a 20 October friendly in Livingston, only have one team in Europe's top club competition. \"It is all based on rankings and what Glasgow City and the national team have done previously,\" she pointed out. Hibs were making their debut in the knockout stage. \"It was a great experience for this young Hibs team and they were unlucky in the draw - played probably one of the challengers for the title this year, Bayern Munich, with 26 players in the squad all full-time professionals and all playing for their national squads; Austrians, Swiss, Germans, Dutch,\" Signeul stressed. \"Bayern Munich also had the golden boot player of the tournament in the Olympics, so it was a tough side. \"It is good for all the players at Hibs to see this is the level they want to get to. \"Sometimes you play in internationals and get a little bit cheated - you think you are better than you are because you are playing weaker teams.\" City, Scottish champions for the last nine seasons, reached the Champions League quarter-finals in 2014 but have suffered disappointment two seasons in a row in the round of 32. \"Glasgow City had a chance in their game, but Eskilstuna, the Swedish runners-up, were a little too strong for them,\" said Signeul. \"They had two good games and they were a little unlucky in the way the goals came in both games.\" The future of Signeul's Scottish FA colleague, men's head coach Gordon Strachan, was called into question this week after a draw with Lithuania and a defeat by Slovakia in their 2018 World Cup qualifiers. Signeul stressed that it was unfair to compare the success of her side to Strachan's because \"results usually follow the rankings in women's football\" while the men's game was more competitive and less predictable. She added that she believed Strachan, who has decided to remain in post, continues to have the full backing of his players.",
        "It means instead of people owning cars and bikes, one version of the future is we all hire transport to get around. This week we got another example of that in the capital when oBike launched. It is a company backed by considerable venture capital and it's putting hundreds of hire bikes on London's streets. The company aims to have thousands in the capital by the end of the summer, after already operating huge schemes in South East Asia. The big difference compared to the existing cycle hire scheme is the bikes have no docking stations. A locking rear brake means they can be left anywhere. Users access them via an app and you can find them as they have a GPS locator. There is a one-off \u00c2\u00a349 refundable deposit to be paid and then 50p per half-hour. More companies are set to follow. oBike says it is aiming to work in conjunction with the existing scheme and it has a social agenda to help clean up London's air and reduce emissions. It also wants to work with Transport for London (TfL) and local councils but unfortunately that hasn't happened. Some councils are furious they haven't been consulted and bikes have been \"dumped\" in their areas with no warning. Hackney Council, while backing cycle hire generally, says it has concerns the oBike can be left anywhere, obstructing pavements and roads. The east London local authority added it has had no dialogue with the company at all. In Hammersmith & Fulham, the west London council raised concerns with oBike when about 400 of its yellow bikes appeared in the borough unannounced. \"We're very much in favour of cycling,\" said Cllr Stephen Cowan, leader of Hammersmith & Fulham Council. \"But we expect companies to properly consult with us first. This launch could have been much better thought out.\" He said oBike has agreed to remove the bikes they have deposited in the borough. As we have seen before in London, we are getting a clash between the authorities and new technology companies. City Hall has been rather guarded in its welcome.

        "Gabon was selected as host on Wednesday by the Confederation of African Football's Executive Committee, beating rival candidates Ghana and Algeria. \"We will prepare ourselves to win the Nations Cup in 2017,\" said Gabon football official Jean-Felix Mba Nze. \"We have decided to play and win the cup.\" Gabon first entered the Nations Cup in 1970 but failed to qualify for the finals until 1994. Their best results came when reaching the quarter-finals in 1996 and 2012, a tournament they co-hosted with Equatorial Guinea. During this year's Nations Cup, which also took place in Equatorial Guinea, the Panthers crashed out early after winning one and losing two of their group games. The 2017 Nations Cup will be the first time Gabon has staged the finals by itself. \"Our main challenge is to organise a better competition than we did in 2012,\" Mba Nze, the secretary general of the Gabonese federation, told BBC Sport. \"I think we won the bid because we made a good presentation and we have made efforts to improve all the stadiums, hospitals and media facilities. \"We are more developed than we were for the last Nations Cup.\" Gabon will use two stadiums from the 2012 finals - in Libreville (capacity: 45,000) and Franceville (25,000) - while adding another two. The new venues of Port Gentil and Oyem, both of which are scheduled to be 20,000-seater stadiums, are set to be ready in August 2016, five months before the competition begins. Gabon's victory was greeted with anger by both the countries it beat. The Algerian press decried the decision, with Algeria Soir calling it a 'sporting and political defeat for Algeria' while El Watan lamented that the country's presentation was 'not sufficiently supported at political levels.' Meanwhile, the Ghanaian bid told the BBC it was 'intrigued' by the decision and asked for greater transparency in the results process, asking why the Confederation of African Football (Caf) had not made the results public. In response, Caf stated that the results of voting were not released when the host countries for the 2019, 2021 and 2023 Nations Cups were announced last September.",
        "They spend an average of \u00c2\u00a3581 a year on music festivals, often opting for VIP passes or upgraded camping options. Predominantly male, the \"superfans\" are also more likely than most consumers to buy music on CD or as downloads. The results came from a survey of 504 UK residents, who had attended at least one festival in the last year. According to ticketing website Eventbrite, which commissioned the survey, these \"superfans\" help to \"drive the music festivals market\", often recommending music and events to their friends. They account for 28% of the festival-going audience, and more than half of them (54%) say they would be willing to attend an event alone. On average, they spend \u00c2\u00a345 more per event than a casual fan, but their loyalty is not guaranteed: 46% say that festivals are becoming \"too corporate\". There are more than 100 music festivals held in the UK every year, from the likes of Glastonbury and T In The Park, to smaller events such as the Cambridge Jazz Festival and Jamie Oliver's Big Feastival. In total, 3.7 million people attend festivals every year, according to Music UK, accounting for more than 39,000 full-time jobs. However, small profit margins and a crowded market have seen some events struggle. In the wet summer of 2012, 57 festivals were forced to cancel - with the likes of Oxegen and The Big Chill shutting their doors. Although the rate of closures has slowed since then, several events - including the Temples festival in Bristol, Down To The Woods in Sedgefield and Field Day in Tunbridge Wells were called off this year; while Sonisphere failed to return from a planned hiatus in 2015. The latest research offers some reassurance to organisers though, with 88% of respondents saying they planned to attend a festival again next year - with more than half of them saying they would go to more. \"It has been a challenging year for some festivals, with inclement weather conditions, general economic uncertainty following Brexit, rising expenditure and heightened security concerns,\" said Paul Reed, who runs the Association of Independent Festivals. \"This research illustrates that the sector remains buoyant, that festival promoters are resilient and will continue to craft unforgettable experiences for audiences, who are keen to return year on year to their favourite events.\" Follow us on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, on Instagram at bbcnewsents, or email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.",

Suffolk Constabulary said it warned Norfolk Police about the group ahead of its arrival on Friday. Norfolk confirmed it was made aware and said it was reviewing its response. Suffolk officers said they told their Norfolk colleagues about the group after it was issued with a local authority notice to leave Lowestoft on Friday afternoon. The notice had been served after a number of incidents of disturbance in the town. Norfolk confirmed it had been told but said there was \"no intelligence to suggest where the group was heading\". On Friday, a woman in her late teens was raped at a bus stop in Cadogan Road, near the seafront. Norfolk Police said there was evidence to suggest it could have been linked to the disorder in the town. One man was arrested and released under investigation in connection with the rape. No other arrests have been made. On Saturday night, a BBC reporter was told by a taxi driver that \"travellers are rampaging the town\", and staff at The Wellington pub said they closed after a group of 30 travellers became \"rowdy\".

        "The A320 pilot reported seeing a white quadcopter drone \"flash past\" the aircraft while travelling south of Brookmans Park last August. No avoiding action was possible due to the lack of available time, a UK Airprox Board report said. It concluded a \"collision had only been narrowly avoided and chance had played a major part\". Air traffic control said the A320 pilot reported that \"something had just gone over the top of him\" at about 18:45 BST on 15 August 2016 while flying north of Potters Bar. The controller said another aircraft had just crossed above but the pilot said the object was red and white in colour, had red and blue stripes on two of the rotor arms and was under a metre in size. All drone operators are required to observe Air Navigation Order (ANO) 2016 articles which require a person in charge of a small unmanned aircraft to only fly the aircraft if reasonably satisfied the flight can safely be made ,and not to recklessly or negligently cause or permit an aircraft to endanger any person or property. They must also maintain \"direct, unaided visual contact\" with the aircraft that's sufficient to monitor its flight path in relation to other aircraft. Airprox board members agreed the drone had been operated at an altitude that was beyond direct unaided line-of-sight, which was not permitted under current regulations without explicit Civil Aviation Authority",
        "A survey of employees and managers found that a quarter of new fathers took no paternity leave at all. Fewer than one in 10 took more than their two weeks statutory leave. The research by the Institute of Leadership & Management (ILM) blamed \"ingrained\" attitudes among employers, and concerns among new fathers that they could not afford to take leave. Last year the government announced plans to allow parents to share their maternity and paternity leave - changes are scheduled to come in April 2015. But the ILM said its research suggested the changes would have little impact if attitudes of employers were not addressed as well. \"The introduction of shared parental leave is a crucial step towards enabling more women to progress into senior roles,\" said Charles Elvin, ILM chief executive. \"Yet our research revealed cultural barriers are impeding the uptake of both two weeks statutory paternity leave and additional paternity leave.\" He said there remained a \"cultural expectation\" within organisations that women rather than men will be the ones taking extended periods away from the workplace. The report also said low levels of paternity pay discouraged new fathers, with just 9% surveyed receiving more than two weeks on full pay. Responding to the report, Frances O'Grady, secretary general of the TUC, the trade union body, said pay was the major concern. \"Many dads simply can't afford to take time off, particularly as employers rarely top up their statutory pay.\" Currently, employed fathers are entitled to either one or two weeks' paid paternity leave, though additional leave is also given if the mother returns to work and is not claiming statutory maternity pay. Government plans involve extending this flexibility, allowing parents of newborns to exchange and share their leave. \"We want the introduction of shared parental leave to drive a real cultural shift and help working dads play a greater role",

They must do so to the sound of a single drum beat. This year all music must stop 43 metres away from the church so there is no music within earshot of it. A planned residents' protest has also been restricted to a maximum of 50 people at two locations. The Orange Order has said it is appalled by the determination. \"The commission is now simply a mouthpiece for republican propaganda, allowing them to dictate the terms of when, how and where loyal order parades are held,\" it said. \"The invented new criteria of banning music within 'earshot' of a place of worship not in use, is as mischievous as it is absurd, and clearly put in place to further censor Protestant heritage on the supposed shared streets of Northern Ireland's capital city.\" North Belfast MP Nigel Dodds, of the DUP, said: \"The latest determination by the Parades Commission on Donegall Street demonstrates that this is a bureaucratic monstrosity that has lost the run of itself, simply dances to the tune of republican residents, or a dangerous combination of both. \"It is clear from the document that the Parades Commission gave serious consideration to banning music being played outside Clifton Street Orange hall.

Police said the review had included tracing and speaking to people who were in Wick the night Mr Mcleod died, but who had not previously come forward.

A separate assessment has been ordered by the chief constable into the handling by the police of the Mcleod family's complaints since 1997 of how the death was investigated. Det Ch Supt Gareth Blair, head of major crime at Police Scotland, said the assessment was carried out \"in recognition of the continued impact\" of Mr Mcleod's death on his parents and \"their desire for a conclusive outcome\". He said: \"Our sympathies remain with them. \"It is important to stress, this was not a full reinvestigation of the death itself, but a careful and considered analysis of a significant volume of information which has been recorded relating to the circumstances since 1997. \"Specialist officers from Police Scotland's major crime command undertook this work, which included tracing and speaking to individuals who were in Wick that night and saw Kevin but who had not previously come forward.\" Det Ch Supt Blair said he told Mr Mcleod's parents on Tuesday of the conclusion of the assessment. He said: \"I informed Kevin's parents that having carried out this assessment there is no evidence of criminality and his death remains unexplained, leading me to determine that there is no basis on which to launch a full reinvestigation. \"Police Scotland appeals for any witnesses who have information about Kevin's death to come forward and we will fully consider any new and additional information. \"The chief constable has asked the head of professional standards to carry out a separate assessment to ensure that all matters/complaints raised by the family over the years have been appropriately considered and addressed.\"",
        "Matthew Eteson is on trial at Preston Crown Court for the manslaughter by gross negligence of Kelly Webster, 36, and Lauren Thornton. The pair died in their sleep aboard a boat on Windermere in April 2013. Mr Eteson, 42, from Hale in Greater Manchester, denies the charge. The family had gone to the Lake District for the Easter bank holiday weekend to celebrate a friend's birthday. But on the afternoon of 1 April, Mr Eteson removed the generator from the deck and used it to power a 1kW fan heater to heat the sleeping quarter, prosecutor Mr Graham Reeds QC said. The court was told that there had been no warning to the build-up of the toxic gas because the carbon monoxide sensors had previously been disabled. Mr Reeds said the mother and daughter, both from Leyland in Lancashire, were found dead in their sleeping positions aboard the the second-hand Bayliner 285 motor cruiser Arniston, with fatal levels of carbon monoxide in their bodies. Mr Eteson, who had been sleeping in a separate compartment further away from the generator also succumbed to the effects of carbon monoxide poisoning but did awake to find the bodies. The court also heard Mr Eteson, a qualified gas fitter, had made some amendments to the generator and its exhaust, which experts subsequently deemed to be \"dangerous\". Ms Webster's mother, Nia Webster, had previously asked Mr Eteson about carbon monoxide sensors. He told her they were not working and his partner would unplug a portable detector whenever she was cooking. The trial continues.",
        "NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) said blood group O negative was vital, as it could be used for patients with other blood groups in an emergency. It said O negative blood made up 12% of transfers, although only 7% of people in the UK had that blood type. Meanwhile, B negative blood is needed for ethnic groups. The NHSBT said ethnic minority groups, who were more likely to have B negative blood, were more prone to sickle cell anaemia, where misshapen blood cells could block blood vessels, causing an early death. It also said such groups were more at risk of developing thalassemia, a group of inherited blood disorders that hindered the blood's ability to carry oxygen. Only 2% of Britain's population were B negative, but hospitals had used 6% more of this blood type in the past last four weeks than the same period last year, said the NHSBT. B negative blood was useful as it could be used for both B negative and B positive patients, the organisation said. Donna Batty, donor relations manager at the NHSBT, asked donors to come forward in the \"next few days\". She said stocks of \"these vulnerable groups\" were \"lower than we would like\". Ms Batty added: \"We are also asking donors of those blood groups who have an appointment coming up to keep it. \"We hope our fantastic donors respond to this appeal and that they bear with us if there are slightly longer waits than normal on session as a result.\" In total, 4% of the UK's population currently donate blood. Jon Latham is assistant director of marketing of NHSBT said that ideally they wanted \"first-time donors\" to come forward. He said: \"The bigger the database we have for people willing to donate, the easier it us for us to call upon them at times of the year when when we have a",
        "The Employment and Learning minister, Dr Stephen Farry, has decided to remove a special premium payment of \u00c2\u00a31.1m which it has been getting to compensate for its small scale and specialist status. It has fewer than 1,000 students and an income of \u00c2\u00a34.7m a year. Protesters have said that the removal of the small institution premium, coupled with a general cutback in Department of Employment and Learning (DEL) funding, would mean the college loses 31% of its budget. However, an extra \u00c2\u00a332m for the DEL, revealed in this week's overall budget improves the situation somewhat. The college says the addition of extra money means it would be asked to manage on a budget reduced by 26.5%. That's a slightly better prediction but the principal, Prof Peter Finn, says that is still far too challenging. He accuses Stephen Farry of a blatantly opportunistic decision to force the college to agree to one of the solutions he proposes for the future streamlining of teacher training in Northern Ireland. None of the four options includes St Mary's keeping its current autonomy. It says it is determined to retain its character and Catholic ethos, however, Prof Finn says he is keen for what he called \"very deep sharing\" between the various teacher training institutions. That could involve students from each being taught in other university colleges from time to time. Prof Finn strongly objects to the notion that the small scale and specialist premia only exist in Northern Ireland and therefore should be removed. He agrees the payments were removed from similar institutions in England but says those bodies, in return, were allowed to charge much higher tuition fees and were not restricted in how many students they could accept. St Mary's was not permitted that freedom. Stranmillis University College, which has mainly trained teachers for",
        "The investment is backed by nearly \u00a315m from the Welsh government with production due to start in late 2018. Economy Minister Edwina Hart said the deal would \"safeguard more than 750 skilled Welsh jobs for many years\". \"In a climate of stiff global competitiveness, we have been actively seeking to win a share of this investment for Wales,\" she said. \"Ford's decision to manufacture its new innovative engine here in Wales is a tribute to the reputation of the local management team and the quality and loyalty of the Welsh workforce,\" she added. The Ford Bridgend plant opened in 1980 and has fought fierce competition to win successive investments in the past worth more than \u00a32.8bn. The company has said its presence supports around 10,000 jobs in south Wales, with 1,860 employed at the plant itself. Ford said technicians based in Essex and Germany had worked together on the design and development of a new fuel-efficient range of engines. A letter from Ford to workers seen by the BBC in June said that to win the investment there would need to be a change to working conditions at Bridgend to make the plant more competitive. Welsh Conservative shadow economy minister William Graham said Friday's announcement was a sign of \"confidence in the UK government's efforts to rebuild the economy\". This is good news for workers at Bridgend as the new production will begin in 2018, just as the manufacturing of Jaguar Land Rover engines at the site will be coming to an end. It secured hundreds of jobs that may otherwise have been in jeopardy. Two hundred fixed contract workers were let go at Ford Bridgend this year when it stopped manufacturing engines for Volvo. There are concerns, though, that the new investment will mean that Bridgend can only manufacture a third of the number of engines it does",
        "S4C gets most of its income from the licence fee and UK ministers have announced a major review of the BBC. Monmouth MP David Davies told BBC Wales S4C was a \"special case as it promotes the Welsh language\". Ministers have said S4C should aim for similar cost savings as the BBC. On Thursday, Labour warned that cuts to the BBC's budget threatened S4C, but Culture Secretary John Whittingdale told MPs there was a commitment to the channel \"within the next couple of years\", and he hoped to have discussions with its management in the near future. Mr Davies told BBC Radio Cymru's Rhaglen Dylan Jones, on Friday: \"The government realise the importance of S4C and that it's more than a station, it's important to the future of the Welsh language.\" Mr Davies also hinted that the Welsh Affairs Committee, which he chairs, could consider conducting an inquiry into broadcasting, including S4C. \"These are personal views but I believe S4C to be a special case as it promotes the Welsh language and I believe it to be more important that S4C caries on more than any other BBC channel,\" he added. S4C has said it has experienced \"substantial cuts\" since 2010 and would emphasise the \"uniqueness\" of its service, and its \"value and importance, both culturally and economically\", in talks with ministers. A green paper on the future of the BBC released on Thursday noted that \"audience reach has been falling across some indigenous language services over the last few years, particularly in Wales\". It added the higher hourly cost of Welsh-language radio programming compared to English-language output \"raises concerns about value for money\".",
        "The latest Markit Report on Jobs for Scotland found sharp rises in permanent and temporary job placements in April. Growth in temporary staff demand was also at its highest in nearly a decade. However, recruiters said success was threatened by declining candidate availability as employers struggled to bring in the skills they need. The Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) said whichever party formed a government after the general election on 8 June must safeguard access to workers the country needs from abroad, as well as invest in UK jobseekers. The jobs report found growth in permanent appointments continued for the third month running in April, with the fastest rate of expansion for 21 months. This contrasted with a slowdown recorded across the UK as a whole. There was also a sharp increase in temporary placements - the steepest since August 2014. However, the availability of workers fell further in April, with the sharpest drop in the availability of permanent staff in nine months. Meanwhile, availability of Scottish temporary candidates declined at the quickest pace in nearly two years. The IT and computing, nursing/medical/care and hotel and catering sectors saw the highest growth in demand for permanent staff, while nursing/medical/care, IT and computing and engineering and construction led the way for temporary staff. The report also found that average salaries for permanent starters in Scotland rose sharply in April, while the rate at which temporary pay increased in Scotland was the fastest recorded for a year. REC chief executive Kevin Green said: \"The resurgence of the Scottish jobs market continues for the third month running. \"Demand for temporary staff is at the highest level recorded in almost 10 years as employers seek to manage Brexit uncertainty and meet consumer demand. \"News that starting salaries for permanent roles are increasing will also be welcome - there's a lot to feel good about north of the border.\" He added: \"Declining candidate availability is a threat to this success, because employers are struggling to bring in the skills they need. \"If British business is to thrive, then whichever party forms a government after 8 June needs to address the ever-shrinking pool of suitable candidates by investing in skills and career advice for UK jobseekers as well as safeguarding access to the workers",

Although the UN deadline for the total destruction of Syria's chemical weapons is 30 June, Damascus had vowed to complete the removal of its stockpile by 27 April, after missing several deadlines. \"The biggest bulk of the chemical weapons material is removed but not yet destroyed and that counts towards the 30 June deadline. That's why it's so important to get the remainder of the chemical weapons material that is still in one site,\" Ms Kaag, the head of the OPCW-UN Joint Mission, told the BBC. She also said the UN was concerned by recent reports that Syrian forces had used chlorine gas as a weapon. Chlorine was not a substance included in the deal, which is widely seen as having averted US military action against the Syrian government. Damascus has denied using chlorine gas as a weapon. Most of Syria's chemical weapons substances exist as separate materials that only create the highly toxic warfare agents when mixed together, according to the OPCW. Ms Kaag said the facilities need to produce, prepare and launch a chemical weapons attack had been destroyed. \"What remains are the elements of a chemical weapon, but the chemical weapons programme of",

        "On 30 January 1915, England played Scotland in a charity match organised by former England international and Northampton Saints captain Edgar Mobbs. The aim of the game had been to recruit sportsmen to Mobbs's World War One battalion. The commemorative match will take place on 24 January 2015 at Olney Rugby Club. It will see players from the East Midlands region line up against The 1st Battalion of the Yorkshire Regiment, while Olney Ladies will face the Army Women's XV.

Instead, he joined up as a private. He was called in to encourage people to sign up and on one occasion addressed a large crowd at a Northampton Saints game. He was credited with helping persuade more than 200 men to join. The international match in 1915 is said to have inspired hundreds of men to sign up to his own corps, the Sportman's Battalion, which formed a significant part of the 7th Battalion of the Northamptonshire Regiment. Among these were 16 Olney players who died during the war. Members of Mobbs's family. including his great-nephew, also named Edgar Mobbs, will be attending next year's game.

        "Christopher Kelly, 40, strangled his friend Dorothy Beattie, 51, at her home in Dunoon, Argyll and Bute, on 22 May. The High Court in Glasgow heard he attacked her after she allegedly made a jibe about his children. Kelly, who was caught after confessing to a GP, was originally charged with murder but pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of culpable homicide. The court heard how Kelly had previously been a support worker for Ms Beattie, who suffered from a number of medical conditions including seizures. The divorced mother and Kelly later became friends and often socialised together. The social care graduate attacked her at her home, however, after she allegedly made \"derogatory\" remarks about his children. Kelly grabbed Ms Beattie and strangled her before leaving the flat. He later returned and on finding her dead sat with her body before moving it to her bed before fleeing. The court was told Kelly took a train to Edinburgh having used Ms Beattie's bank card to steal \u00c2\u00a3300 from his victim's bank account. The victim's body was found by her daughter, who had failed to establish contact, on 25 May. Kelly apparently slept rough in Edinburgh until 28 May when he attended a GP surgery and confessed to killing Ms Beattie. Kelly told a doctor that \"something bad has happened\" adding: \"I think I killed her.\" He went on: \"I remember fighting and grabbing her around the neck. I blacked out and don't remember anything until I suddenly became aware she was dead. \"I carried her body to the bed and left the house. I've not been back since.\" Kelly also said: \"We're just pals - I had been her support worker.\" Police were called and Kelly told officers the last few days had been \"torture\". The court heard Ms Beattie's injuries involved the use of \"significant force\". Judge Lord Bannatyne said the jail-term would have been seven years, but for Kelly's guilty plea. The judge said: \"On any view, given what has been said, this is a tragic case.\" Kelly mouthed \"sorry\" to the victim's two daughters as was lead handcuffed to the cells.",

Mr Museveni's supporters said his opponents had failed to offer any chance of progress. But Mr Besigye, who is under house arrest, said the results were a \"sham\", calling on the international community to reject them. \"We have just witnessed what must be the most fraudulent electoral process in Uganda,\" he said in a statement. EU observers have also criticised the poll, saying the governing party had created an \"intimidating atmosphere\" and that the opposition alleged vote rigging. While praising the \"remarkable determination\" of Ugandans to vote, EU Chief Observer Eduard Kukan said the governing National Resistance Movement's \"domination of the political landscape distorted the fairness of the campaign\". The election has been marred by sporadic violence and opposition allegations of electoral fraud, with social media sites and messaging apps blocked. Mr Besigye was put under house arrest on Friday on the suspicion he would announce the results himself, breaking electoral laws, police said. It is the fourth time Mr Besigye, candidate for the opposition Forum for Democratic Change, has taken on President Museveni. The two men were once allies, with Mr Besigye serving as Mr Museveni as his personal doctor when they were guerrilla fighters. Mr Museveni seized power in 1986 and is credited with restoring stability to Uganda. However, critics say he has become increasingly authoritarian.

He asked: \"Why did you inject your mother with a substance which for all you knew could kill her within five minutes and do nothing for an hour and twenty minutes?\" She replied: \"I never intended my mother to die.\" Ms Knight also told the court she had attempted suicide in 2006 by injecting herself with insulin. Ms Robson died in September but the jury was told earlier in the trial that her death was not relevant to the case and had no bearing on the issues",
        "The Korea Space Launch Vehicle-1 (KSLV-1) blasted off from the Naro Space Center at 16:00 (07:00 GMT). Science Minister Lee Ju-ho said the satellite, which will collect climate data, was in its correct orbit. The launch comes weeks after North Korea used its own three-stage rocket to place a satellite into orbit, sparking international criticism. South Korea's 140-tonne rocket, known as Naro, was built in partnership with Russia, which had agreed to work with Seoul for three launch attempts. Analysis: What is driving North Korea's nuclear test plan? Previous launches in 2009 and 2010 failed, and this attempt had been postponed twice for technical reasons. But officials said Wednesday's launch from the site 480km (298 miles) south of Seoul had gone as planned and that the rocket had reached its target altitude and deployed its satellite. \"After analysing various data, the Naro rocket successfully put the science satellite into designated orbit,\" Mr Lee told reporters. He said the satellite had detached 540 seconds after launch. \"We now have leapt up a step to become a space-power nation,\" he said, adding that South Korea would use this \"overwhelming moment as a strong, dynamic force\" to help drive an independent space programme. The satellite, called Science and Technology Satellite-2C, is designed to collect climate data. The Yonhap news said it was expected to make contact with its ground station at 05:00 on Thursday, at which point its operators will be able to make the final judgement on whether the launch achieved its goals. South Korea does already have satellites in space, but they were launched from other countries. On its first attempt to carry out a launch on its own soil, in 2009, the satellite failed to detach from the rocket in orbit. In 2010, the rocket exploded seconds after take-off. Pressure for success has increased since North Korea launched a rocket that placed a satellite in orbit on 12 December. It followed the launch by announcing plans for a \"high-level nuclear test\" and more long-range rocket launches. The UN said the North Korean launch constituted a banned test of missile technology and voted to extend sanctions against Pyongyang. There have",

He added that the club had been put up for sale 22 hours after the FA's decision five months ago. Allam said that an appeal was being lodged against the name change rejection with the Court of Arbitration for Sport. \"We stated earlier this year that the club would be for sale should our attempt to globally promote Hull Tigers as a brand name and as a playing name be blocked,\" he said. \"As a consequence of the FA decision on 9 April, I announced on 10 April, within 22 hours, that Hull City is for sale.\" Allam, who took charge of the club in December 2010, was asked what he would do if a buyer could not be found and the legal appeal was dismissed. \"I will give it away. Out means I'm out. Have I ever said anything and gone back on it?\" he said. Allam said he and son Ehab, who is the club's acting chief executive, would remain committed to the club for the time being. \"If the appeal comes first, ok, no harm done. If the sale comes first - sold,\" he said. He was sketchy on whether there had been interest from potential buyers and indicated he may stay on should the appeal be successful. The chairman conceded that manager Steve Bruce and his players needed stability, but pointed to his investment during the transfer window, which included the signing of Uruguay striker Abel Hernandez for a reported club record fee of \u00a310m. Hull reached the FA Cup final last season, losing 3-2 to Arsenal after going two ahead, and finished 16th in their first season back in the Premier League following promotion from the Championship.

Former Republish of Ireland Under-21 player Power, 29, leaves English League Two club Lincoln City, where he made over 250 league appearances. Both players have agreed two-year contracts with the Rugby Park club, with Power's move subject to clearance. \"It feels good to be here, as it's a club that's definitely going in the right direction,\" Higgins told Kilmarnock's website. Manager Lee McCulloch said Higgins fits Kilmarnock's philosophy of developing young players. \"He came through Celtic's academy, which has seen many impressive young players come through,\" said McCulloch. \"For the second half of last season he gained experience at Dundee and through time will only get better, which is only a good thing for this club.\" And Power said: \"I've heard a lot about the town and the club's history and I can't wait to get started. The manager spoke about his visions for this club and it was an easy decision to make.\" McCulloch said he watch Lincoln's run to the quarter-finals of the FA Cup last season and said of Power: \"Alan played in all of those games and was the cub captain. \"He has an aggressive style of play, has a hunger to get better, and has great experience that he can pass on to the younger kids.\" Kilmarnock begin their league campaign at home to St Johnstone on 5 August.

Wood was dropped following the Rugby World Cup, with Jones telling him his performances were \"distinctly average\". \"He's improved his work-rate, his impact as a ball carrier, and he's certainly above average now,\" Jones added. \"He's got very good lineout skills and his breakdown work has improved. So we are excited about him being in the squad. \"His [lineout work] gives him a great chance of being selected.\" Jones has selected six uncapped players in his 33-man squad, but has played down their chances of being selected against the Springboks on 12 November. \"Making your debut against South Africa is probably not the right game to make your debut,\" Jones explained.

Come for the facts, stay for the snark,\" the account declares. BBC News contacted the rogue Environmental Protection Agency account called @ActualEPAFacts. They told us they acted to make sure \"factual information about climate change and other scientific research continues to be shared during the Trump administration\". They claimed to be three EPA employees and said they acted after a gagging order stopped them from doing interviews relating to their research. Media reports have suggested that the Trump administration sought to limit how certain government agencies - including the EPA - communicate with the public. The official EPA Twitter account has not posted since 19 January, a day before Mr Trump's inauguration. ActualEPAFacts told us they were surprised by how many people are now following their account - more than 90,000 currently - but also felt exposed by what they were doing. The other rogue accounts also have large numbers of followers. More than 370,000 are following @RogueNasa after a handful of tweets in a few days. The rogue National Park Service account @AltNatParkSer has attracted even more people, with more than a million followers after less than 300 tweets. There are also rogue accounts for the US Department of Agriculture, Forest Service and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They use similar phrases such as \"resistance\" to describe themselves and post a mixture of scientific information and attacks on Mr Trump. Some of those running the other alternative accounts also claimed to be disgruntled government agency workers, at least going by their tweets. The @AltNatParkSer account tweeted on Tuesday that they were \"being run by several active NPS rangers and friends\". However, on Thursday they said they were handing over to a different group of people - activists and journalists who were former scientists. On Tuesday the official account of Badlands National Park in South Dakota started tweeting about global warming, but those posts were later deleted. The people behind the @AltNatParkSer told us this inspired them to set up their Twitter account. The other alternative accounts also appear to have been created after the Badlands tweets were deleted, while some official US national park accounts also tweeted about climate change on Wednesday.

        "A report from British Marine, which represents the leisure, superyacht and small commercial marine industry, said superyacht revenues for the year to April 2016 had reached \u00a3605m. Revenues for the whole sector rose 1.6% to \u00a33.01bn, the first time the \u00a33bn mark has been breached since 2008-2009. However, the report predicted growth would slow during 2017. It said uncertainty over Brexit negotiations was likely to curb demand. Total revenue fell in the wake of financial crisis, reaching its lowest point in the financial year 2011-2012 of \u00a32,85bn and has been gradually picking up since then. Increased revenue from engine and equipment manufacturing, as well as a jump in sales of hire and charter boats, are believed to have driven the sales increase. Exports for the year were down 0.7% to \u00a3882m but British Marine said that in the last few months the industry had benefited from the fall in the pound against the dollar and the euro since the referendum, as it has boosted buying power from overseas customers. However, marine businesses surveyed for the report expected that the support from the strong pound would be a short-term benefit. Howard Pridding, chief executive of British Marine, said: \"The industry remains robust - revenue is growing and we are taking on more employees. \"Despite the post-referendum volatility impacting on business and consumer confidence, the industry remains bullish.\" The report said industry growth was expected to slow in 2017 \"as economic volatility increases closer to and during negotiations over the UK's exit from the European Union.\" Sunseeker and Princess are the UK's biggest superyacht companies. Globally, the industry is the fourth largest in terms of turnover.",
        "The deal unveiled by Russia on Thursday to set up four \"de-escalation zones\" is backed by Turkey and Iran. But the main Syrian opposition grouping says it has little faith in the deal. Elsewhere in Syria, activists say government aircraft have hit central Hama province, and there are reports of shelling and gunfire in other parts. The opposition High Negotiations Committee (HNC), said on Friday the safe zones plan lacked \"safeguards and compliance mechanisms\". It also said it did not accept Iran as a guarantor of the deal. The UN special envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, told the BBC the agreement was important because it was being implemented by three countries who could make it work. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said Syrian fighter jets on Saturday bombed rebel positions in Hama. A rebel commander confirmed that fighting had broken out after midnight, Reuters reports. The Syrian military have so far not commented on the issue. The so-called \"memorandum on the creation of de-escalation areas\" was announced by the Russian military after talks in Kazakhstan's capital Astana. Russia's foreign ministry published the full text of the agreement on Saturday. The objective is to halt attacks by all sides and to \"provide the conditions for the safe and voluntary return of refugees\" in addition to the speedy provision of relief supplies and medical aid. The four zones will remain in place for six months, but their borders have to be finalised by Russia, Iran and Turkey by 4 June. Under the plan, the four zones will be established in: Russian Deputy Defence Minister Alexander Fomin said on Friday that there had been no bombing raids by Russian aviation in the four zones since 1 May. But he stressed that Russia's air force would continue striking militants from the Islamic State (IS) group elsewhere in Syria.

A decision will also be made about the fate of Natalie McGarry and Michelle Thomson, who were elected as SNP MPs but now sit as independent members. Labour's executive is also expected to decide candidate selection, while some challengers have come forward for the Conservatives and Lib Dems already. The UK goes to the polls on 8 June after Prime Minister Theresa May announced plans for a snap election, subsequently endorsed by MPs by 552 votes to 13. Ms McGarry and Ms Thomson were the only two Scottish MPs to vote against the election, with SNP members abstaining. If they do not return, the SNP will need to find five candidates, including three for the seats the party did not win in 2015. A number of party activists have already announced their intention to bid for the SNP ticket in the Glasgow East and Edinburgh West seats formerly occupied by the two women. On Friday, the UK Labour party issued a call for prospective for parliamentary candidates over Twitter, inviting party members to apply with a deadline of noon on Sunday. The Scottish party's executive group is meeting over the weekend to agree their selection procedure, with leader Kezia Dugdale saying they were ready and had already been preparing for an election. The party's sole MP north of the border, Ian Murray, launched his campaign to defend Edinburgh South on Friday. Scottish Secretary David Mundell then followed suit in Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale. Representatives of other parties have started to declare their candidacies for various seats. Tory MSP Douglas Ross, who was elected to Holyrood in 2016, has announced he will challenge SNP depute leader Angus Robertson in Moray. And former Lib Dem MP Jo Swinson said she would seek a rematch with John Nicolson in East Dunbartonshire, two years after the SNP member ousted her from the seat.

        "The charity wants 10% of the 4.8 million Syrians displaced by civil war to be resettled by the end of the year. Ahead of UN talks in Geneva on the crisis, it highlighted figures showing only 1.4% had been helped so far. Oxfam said UK plans to resettle 20,000 Syrians by 2020 were \"not good enough\", but Britain says it is also focused on providing aid to people in the region. The UK's pledge of \u00c2\u00a32.3bn to help people affected by the humanitarian crisis caused by the civil war in Syria makes it the second largest bilateral donor in the world after the US. Oxfam says while Britain has been generous in providing financial aid for those displaced by Syria's civil war, it \"can and should do more\". It argues that countries with strong economies and developed infrastructures need to shoulder a greater responsibility towards refugees than nations such as Lebanon and Jordan, where thousands of Syrians are now based. The Geneva conference should, the UK-based charity added, result in \"urgent solutions, offering people safe and legal routes to a welcome\" in other countries. Oxfam examined the pledges of 28 nations that are members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and signatories to the 1951 Convention on Refugees. It says they have promised to take in almost 130,000 of Syrian refugees, although only 67,000 have actually arrived. The 10% of Syrian refugees Oxfam wants the rich nations to take in by the end of the 2016 represents the proportion the UN says are very vulnerable and in need of resettlement. According to Oxfam's analysis, only Canada, Germany, Norway have made resettlement pledges exceeding their \"fair share\", a measure based on the size of their economies. It says five other nations - Australia, Finland, Iceland, Sweden, New Zealand - have pledged more than half of their fare share. In contrast, the UK is set to take 22% of its fair share, the US just 7%, and France only 4%. Mark Goldring, chief executive of Oxfam",
        "The last print edition will be on 31 December, reflecting the trend for newspapers and magazines to move online as traditional advertising declines. Newsweek merged with the internet news group the Daily Beast two years ago. The Daily Beast's founder, Tina Brown, said its site now had more than 15 million unique visitors a month, a 70% increase on last year. She said in a statement: \"Exiting print is an extremely difficult moment for all of us who love the romance of print and the unique weekly camaraderie of those hectic hours before the close on Friday night. By Ben ThompsonBusiness reporter, New York In 1933, Newsweek hit the news stands - a weekly magazine covering global events. But much like the world it's reported on over the last 80 years, much has changed in the publishing world too. Not least how consumers get their news. The number of Newsweek subscribers has slumped from more than 3 million at its peak to 1.5 million today. Couple that with falling advertising revenues for traditional print media and it's led Newsweek to ditch its print edition altogether. Newsweek Global, the digital only version, will be available via a subscription. It's a way of tapping into the 70 million consumers who now use tablet computers in the US, a figure that's soared from just 13 million two years ago. But while it's a large market, there are also more competitors, and analysts say standing out in a digital world will be tough. \"But as we head for the 80th anniversary of Newsweek next year, we must sustain the journalism that gives the magazine its purpose - and embrace the all-digital future. \"This decision is not about the quality of the brand or the journalism - that is as powerful as ever.

The vote concerned whether the strategy for the area should be referred to the secretary of state for approval. He declared his interest in the charity prior to the meeting, but was found guilty of taking part in the vote \"without reasonable excuse\" despite his pecuniary interest. The core strategy included plans for redevelopment in Wimborne and, although no planning permission had been submitted, it was thought some of Synergy's social housing could be improved by developers Wyatt.

But Clark's 108 not out from 133 balls and Shivnarine Chanderpaul's steady 85 not out rebuilt the visitor's innings. Clark reached his century with a huge pulled six shortly before the close. Retired West Indies international Chanderpaul put on 55 with Ryan McLaren, calming the innings after the early wickets, before the 42-year-old was joined by Clark when Gareth Batty dismissed McLaren. The pair then shared an unbeaten partnership of 172 with Clark - batting at eight in the order - soon overtaking Chanderpaul's score, beating him to his half-century. The game was halted due to bad light in the evening session but that did nothing to halt Clark's progress. In total the 26-year-old - whose previous high score was 84 not out - hit 17 fours and three sixes in his innings. The change in fortunes for Lancashire was even more remarkable given they were five wickets down inside 22 overs. Footitt - who took eight wickets in Surrey's season opener win against Warwickshire - dismissed opener Alex Davies, Lancashire's stand-in captain Liam Livingstone and Dane Vilas while Sam and Tom Curran took a wicket apiece in the early flurry.

US District Judge Paul Friedman's judgement points to medical assessments which showed that Mr Hinckley had had \"no symptoms of active mental illness\" since 1983.

One director said it was due to escalating costs and being owed money. Newport dairy farmer John Sollis called it a \"disaster\" for people in the area who were owed money. Documents lodged on the Companies House website show one livestock trader is owed in excess of \u00a3107,000, while others are owed significant five figure sums. In his report, liquidator Gary Stones said any payments to unsecured creditors were \"totally dependent on the collection of the Irish book debt\". The report indicated almost \u00a3470,000 was owed to Emcol by an Irish firm. Mr Sollis, who is owed almost \u00a315,000 by Emcol, said: \"It was a disaster in a sense the amount of money that people have lost in the locality and not now having a local abattoir to move stock to or casualties. \"Casualties and stock have to go further afield and that's costing us money.\" The nearest abattoir is in Cross Hands, Carmarthenshire. NFU Cymru President Stephen James is owed just over \u00a31,000 and said the loss of the abattoir was a \"huge blow\" as it dealt with injured cows. He said injured cows now had to be shot on the farm premises, resulting in a loss for farmers. One of Emcol's directors, Helen Lewis, said the collapse was down to a \"very significant amount of money\" owed to the company by an Irish firm, and the \"escalating costs of running an abattoir\". She said she had \"every sympathy\" for farmers who had lost out and \"she knew many personally\".",
        "Ben Purdy, 18, was shot in the head in Bermondsey after confronting his girlfriend's ex about \"threatening\" messages sent after their break-up. Andrew Bayne, 37, of Trundleys Terrace, and his nephew Michael Bagnall, 22, of Hospital Way - both in Lewisham - were found guilty of the murder. They will be sentenced at the Old Bailey on 20 November. The court heard Mr Purdy and two of his friends - Callum Malone and Jack Walker - confronted Bagnell, and, following the \"skirmish\" last November, the defendants drove around Bermondsey looking for Mr Purdy. When they found him in Mossington Gardens, Andrew Bayne shot Mr Purdy in the head then pointed the gun towards Callum before making off. Mr Purdy suffered \"catastrophic injuries\" and died the next day, the court heard. Despite the fact Bagnall had a new girlfriend, prosecutor Crispin Aylett QC told jurors, it still \"rankled\" that she had moved on and he sent her \"threatening messages\" by phone and on Facebook. Mr Aylett said: \"Ben obviously had enough and so that Sunday, around lunchtime, with two friends to help - Callum and Jack - the three of them decided to go and confront Michael Bagnall and have it out with him. \"It was undoubtedly a very stupid thing to have sought to do and cost Ben Purdy his life.\" Bayne was also convicted of possessing a gun with intent and Bagnall of affray. As the guilty verdicts were delivered, Michael Bagnall began shouting and swearing in the dock and had to be removed by officers.",

Tim Vine, Stewart Francis and Zoe Lyon have previously won the competition, run by TV channel Dave. Graham, from West Bromwich, claimed the victory after making the shortlist in both 2014 and 2015. He said \"It's an incredible honour to land Joke of the Fringe. Not bad for someone from West Brom!\" Comedian Stuart Mitchell came second in the poll, with the joke: \"Why is it old people say 'there's no place like home', yet when you put them in one...\" Judges sat through an average of 60 different comedy performances and sifted through more than 3,600 minutes of material before selecting their favourite gags. In a bid to judge only the quality of the joke, the name of the comic or their show is not revealed during the voting process. Steve North, general manager of Dave, said: \"The Fringe is renowned for being the best place to spot new and emerging comedy talent, and although there are some returning contenders in our top 10 this year, there is a high volume of new talent which is very exciting to see.\" Voters also got to select their most \"groan-worthy\" jokes of the festival.

        "The Halle Orchestra wants to open a school in Stoke-on-Trent in 2020, for both primary and secondary pupils. The orchestra will work with an academy trust in setting up the school. John Summers, chief executive of the orchestra, said the project would use music to \"raise aspirations\" across other academic subjects. The school, proposed with the City Learning Trust, would be part of the free schools programme - and approval for its opening depends on the Department for Education. But the orchestra wants to open the school in September 2020, for seven to 19-year-olds, with the promise of masterclasses from musicians, access to concerts and artists in residence. The intention is for students to spend 40% of their time in specialist music classes, working with the Halle Choir, The Halle Youth Orchestra and Halle for Youth. \"The Halle has a huge amount of expertise and experience in working at high level performance, both in terms of instrumental coaching and choral training,\" said John Summers, chief executive of the Halle. \"Through our expertise we will also help develop music in the curriculum as a means of supporting academic achievement and aspiration.\" There are precedents for such a connection between orchestras and schools. In the German city of Bremen, there has been a high-profile partnership when a leading orchestra set up its rehearsal rooms and headquarters in a comprehensive school on a housing estate. The musicians of the Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie Bremen became part of the daily life of the school - and truancy rates were lowered and academic results improved.",
        "Heading the processions were some of those caught up in the suicide bomb attacks on Belgium's airport and metro station that killed 32 people. Belgian broadcaster described the march as \"calm and silent\". The march had been due to be held a week after the 22 March attacks, but officials asked for it to be postponed because of the security threat. Relatives of victims, and paramedics and airport staff affected by the attacks joined people of several religious faiths on Sunday's march. Flowers were carried in memory of those who lost their lives. The procession took them past the Molenbeek neighbourhood - where many of those alleged to have carried out the attacks in both Brussels and Paris had lived - and to the makeshift memorial outside the city's stock exchange. One of the organisers of the march, Hassan Bousetta, told the AFP news agency: \"When our fellow citizens, defenceless civilians, are cut down in a cowardly attack, all citizens should stand up to express their disgust and solidarity.\" The turnout was less than half of the 15,000 organisers had hoped for. The attacks in Brussels were claimed by the Islamic State militant group, which also said it was behind the gun and bomb attacks in Paris on 13 November that killed 130 people. Belgian police have made dozens of arrests in recent weeks, but the authorities - and other security agencies in Europe - are under pressure amid revelations of alleged failures and missed opportunities to stop the terror cell that carried out both attacks.",
        "The company said it had been cleared by government officials in Senegal to launch an evaluation plan. Cairn, which made two discoveries in the area last year, estimated fields there could contain more than a billion barrels of oil. Its evaluation plan will start shortly with a 3D seismic survey. Later this year it aims to launch a multi-well exploration and appraisal programme. Edinburgh-based Cairn has a 40% interest in three blocks offshore Senegal (Sangomar Deep, Sangomar Offshore, Rufisque Offshore). Its partners include ConocoPhillips (35%) and FAR Ltd (15%), with Petrosen, the Senegal National Oil Company, retaining a 10% interest in the exploration phase. In its latest half-yearly report, Cairn also said that it had started international arbitration proceedings with the government of India over a tax row. Cairn has been prevented by Indian authorities from accessing the value of its 10% residual shareholding in Cairn India Limited (CIL). In March, the company received a tax bill for $1.6bn plus interest and penalties, covering the tax year 2006-07, when it was preparing to float Cairn India on the Mumbai stock exchange. Cairn has contested the bill and plans to seek restitution for losses resulting from the falling value of its stake in CIL. Due to the lower oil price, its value has dropped from $1bn in December 2013 to $526m, as at 30 June this year. The lower valuation saw Cairn book a $177.1m impairment loss in its first half, as it reported a post-tax loss of $230m - up from $62m a year ago. The company generates no revenue because its focus is exploration work. However, at the end of the first half, Cairn reported a cash balance of $725m. Cairn's share price was down by about 5% on Tuesday morning.",

Officials imposed a curfew in the Iraqi capital, which has now been lifted. It was the second time this month that protesters had managed to break into the city's government area. Shia Muslim cleric Moqtada Sadr condemned the use of force, and voiced support for the demonstrators' \"peaceful [and] spontaneous revolt\". At least 50 demonstrators are said to have been wounded. The protesters accuse the government of neglecting much-needed reforms, as it struggles with its campaign against the so-called Islamic State group (IS) and declining oil revenues. The Sunni jihadist group controls parts of western and northern Iraq and has been behind a wave of recent attacks that have left dozens killed. Some demonstrators managed to break into the prime minister's office and parliament. Baghdad's Green Zone houses the parliament, key government buildings and many foreign embassies. The authorities later said they had completely regained control of the area and the protesters had withdrawn. The Shia cleric and his militia group, the Mehdi Army, gained prominence after the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. galvanising anti-US sentiment. Mr Sadr's followers clashed repeatedly with US forces, whose withdrawal the cleric consistently demanded. An arrest warrant was issued for Mr Sadr in 2004 in connection with the murder of a rival cleric. His militia was also blamed for the torture and killing of thousands of Sunnis in the sectarian carnage of 2006 and 2007. Mr Sadr fled to Iran during that period. In 2011, Mr Sadr returned from his self-imposed exile to Iraq, taking a more conciliatory tone and calling for Iraqi unity and peace. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, who came to power in 2014, has promised to stamp out corruption and ease sectarian tensions. He has been pressing for radical reforms and wants to form a government of technocrats, but has been blocked by lawmakers, the BBC's Jim Muir in Baghdad reports. Parliament is so deeply split that it cannot hold a meeting because no side can gather a quorum, our correspondent adds. Iraq's system of sharing government jobs has long been criticised for promoting unqualified candidates and encouraging corruption.

The 23-year-old says she was inspired to achieve success as a youngster growing up in north Wales. \"I remember watching people like Kelly Holmes on the TV and that's what inspired me to want to go and get a gold medal,\" she said. \"To think I'm one of those role models now and people are looking up to me is lovely. \"I've seen the difference from London how many girls have got into taekwondo because they've watched it on the TV.\" Jones took up taekwondo when she was 15-years-old, encouraged by grandfather Martin as it would \"keep her off the streets.\" \"When I first started taekwondo I think there was only about four or five girls in the whole club,\" Jones added. \"Now there's loads more girls and it's just amazing to see that. Sport doesn't have to be just for boys - girls are good at it too.\" The -57kg world number one has won a World Grand Prix and two European titles since her success at London 2012. Jones became Britain's first Olympic taekwondo champion by beating China's double world champion Yuzhuo Hou in the final. She became her country's youngest Olympic champion only two years after winning gold at the 2010 inaugural Youth Olympics in Singapore. Flint-bred Jones admits her motivation has been \"up and down\" over the last four years but is focused on winning another gold. \"For London I only came into the national team in 2010, literally two years before the Olympics and no one really expected me to even go to the Olympics,\" Jones told BBC Wales Sport. \"I did really well that year and took the opportunity by the hands.

The prosecution at Newport Crown Court has alleged she was so drunk she could not have consented to sex. The defendant, who is Romanian and lives in Cardiff, denies rape. The court heard the woman lost her friends during her night out and started to walk home along Greyfriars Road, under an underpass by City Hall and then along Museum Avenue at about 02:00 GMT. It was here she was approached by the defendant and the alleged rape happened behind a bush. Claire Pickthall, prosecuting, told the jury the victim was \"so drunk she can't remember the incident happening. She can't even remember him having sex with her\". It was this intoxication, she said, that meant she was not in any state to consent. \"The actions in these circumstances amount to rape,\" Ms Pickthall said. \"He was preying on single, drunk females.\" The court heard Lee Neill, who saw Mr Hamza walking behind the National Museum of Wales with the victim, was so concerned he followed them. Suspecting something \"sinister\", Mr Neill said he took a photograph \"to use as evidence\". The flash frightened Mr Hamza, who ran off, the jury was told. After giving chase, Mr Neill lost Mr Hamza and returned to the alleged victim. He then called the police. However,",

Edward Farmer initially told St Albans Crown Court he saw her in a car in Broadstairs, Kent, between mid-April and June, but later admitted the sighting could have been weeks earlier. The jury heard he claimed to have seen Ms Bailey on Charlotte Street, near to her holiday home in the town, \"driving what looked to be a Range Rover or that type of 4x4, a dark colour\". He said Ms Bailey was by herself, despite defence claims she had been kidnapped by two violent men who had taken her to Broadstairs. When questioned about the date of the alleged sighting, Mr Farmer said it was \"about five, maybe six weeks prior to the police interview [on 13 July]\". Ms Bailey was reported missing by Mr Stewart on 15 April. Under cross-examination by the prosecution, Mr Farmer admitted the sighting could have been in March, weeks before the author was reported missing. He also admitted he had \"no reason at all\" to think about the sighting until he was interviewed by a reporter from The Sun in June. Mr Stewart, 56, of Baldock Road, Royston, Hertfordshire, is accused of drugging his wife-to-be before suffocating her and throwing her in the pit underneath the couple's garage.

        "The Republican sought to laugh off the comment, which was preceded by the supporter saying: \"We have a problem in this country - it's called Muslims\". The comments were made at a campaign rally for Mr Trump in New Hampshire. Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton said his failure to denounce \"hateful rhetoric\" was \"disturbing and wrong\". Pointing to his first questioner at the campaign event in Rochester, the billionaire businessman said: \"I like this guy.\" \"We have a problem in this country called Muslims,\" the man said. \"We know our current president is one. You know he's not even an American.\" \"We need this question?\" Mr Trump said, laughing. \"But anyway,\" the man continued, \"we have training camps growing where they want to kill us. That's my question: When can we get rid of them?\" Mr Trump failed to clarify that Mr Obama is a Christian American, instead replying that \"bad things are happening\" and saying he would look into them. Mrs Clinton joined criticism of Mr Trump on social media, tweeting: \"Donald Trump not denouncing false statements about POTUS & hateful rhetoric about Muslims is disturbing & just plain wrong. Cut it out.\" In a statement, Democratic National Committee chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz said Mr Trump's \"racism knows no bounds\". Mr Trump's campaign manager Corey Lewandowski sought to play down the incident, telling US media that \"all he heard was a question about training camps\". \"The media wants to make this issue about Obama. The bigger issue is that Obama is waging a war against Christians in this country,\" Mr Lewandowski told the Washington Post. The incident evoked a moment during the 2008 campaign when Republican nominee John McCain took the microphone away from a woman who said she did not trust Mr Obama because he was \"an Arab\".

Mr Corbyn has been highly critical of the government's response to the Calais migrant crisis and says the UK must do more. He told me: \"These are human beings, these are people in desperate situations - they need our help and they need our support. \"There's a very large number of people going over to Calais to take aid and support to them - we should be part of the European programme both for Syrian refugees and other refugees.\" His views on immigration are completely at odds with those of the UK Independence Party - whose leader Nigel Farage addressed his annual conference in Doncaster on the issue today. He questioned how any government could plan for school provision, for health provision if you don't know in a couple of years time - to the nearest million - how many people would actually be living in the country. And the Kent Conservative MP and former immigration minister Damian Green also says open-door immigration would be irresponsible. But Mr Corbyn insists that immigration is positive for the UK. \"Our health service, our education service, much of our industrial development in Britain, has been greatly enhanced by the work done by people who have made their homes here, paid their taxes here, worked very hard here and given us this amazing cosmopolitan society that we have.\" He said instead of being afraid of immigration people should welcome the opportunities it brings. No doubt that's a message he'll want to get across to the troops as they meet in Brighton this weekend. He'll also want to address other key issues such as the housing shortage, investment in infrastructure and his opposition to benefits reform. On top of all that he'll want to prove that he can reach out - not only to Labour",

Burmese bar workers Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Tun were found guilty of the killings in December 2015. An appeal court in Thailand upheld the death sentences handed down to them. Lawyers for the two men now have 30 days to appeal to the Supreme Court - Thailand's final court of appeal. The pair's mothers lodged appeals at Koh Samui court last May over concerns about the judgements, in particular the DNA evidence used in the investigation. \"We don't believe the court can say beyond reasonable doubt that Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo were responsible for the events which took place in September 2014,\" said Andy Hall, one of the families' legal advisors. Miss Witheridge, a University of Essex student from Hemsby, and Mr Miller, a civil and structural engineering graduate, were found on a beach having been bludgeoned to death. A post-mortem examination showed Miss Witheridge had been raped. Prosecutors said DNA evidence collected from cigarette butts, a condom and the bodies of the victims linked Lin and Phyo to the deaths. The men, from Myanmar, retracted their initial confessions to the offences, saying they had been tortured by police. Their lawyers argued DNA from a garden hoe - allegedly used as the murder weapon - did not match samples taken from the men. They also claimed evidence had been mishandled by police and the pair's confessions were the result of \"systematic abuse\" of migrants in the area.",

This amount is equivalent to: Source: IEP The most surprising finding, said IEP Chief Executive Steve Killelea, was the \"inequality with peace\" around the world. He said some countries in Western Europe had now reached \"quite historic levels of peace\", enjoying the lowest levels of murder rates and money spent on security \"probably in the countries' history\". But Iraq, Syria, Nigeria, South Sudan and the Central African Republic had all become more violent in the past year, the report said. The IEP said the total costs of conflict amounted to 13.4% of world GDP. \"Large increases in costs have occurred due to deaths from internal conflict, IDPs [internally displaced people] and refugee support, UN peacekeeping and GDP losses from conflict,\" the report said.

Art broker Mossgreen tried to promote it on Facebook, but the social media network rejected it for \"advertising adult products or services\". Mossgreen chief executive Paul Summer said the decision was \"ridiculous\". \"This is a very beautiful image that is not overtly sexual in any shape or form,\" he told the BBC. \"It's like going back to the 1950s. It's ridiculous to censor this sort of thing.\" Facebook said its decision was final, although Mossgreen has since reposted images of the work. \"Such ads lead to negative user sentiment and we have zero tolerance towards such advertisements,\" Facebook said in a message. Last month, a French teacher took Facebook to court after it suspended his account for posting an image of a nude woman painted by 19th Century artist Gustave Courbet.

It follows Alec Leamas, a hard-drinking British intelligence officer whose East Berlin network is in tatters. Le Carre said he was \"very excited\" by the show, which will appear on BBC One. The series will be another co-production with US network AMC, following their joint effort on The Night Manager. Tom Hiddleston, Hugh Laurie and Olivia Colman all won Golden Globes for their roles in the drama, while the show itself was nominated for best mini series or TV film at the awards. The Spy Who Came In From The Cold is set in 1962, months after the building of the Berlin Wall. In the story, Leamas's agents are either on the run or dead - victims of the East German counter-intelligence officer Hans-Dieter Mundt. Leamas is recalled to London where he is offered a chance at revenge. The novel, written in 1963, was made into a film starring Richard Burton in 1965 and le Carre said he was looking forward to seeing it on screen again. He said: \"I'm very excited by the project, and have great confidence in the team.\" Beaufoy added: \"It's incredibly exciting to be working on the best Cold War spy story ever written.\" The show will be produced by The Ink Factory, the production company behind The Night Manager, in association with Character 7.

According to the OUP, new technology is increasingly at the centre of the children's lives but how they are writing about it is changing fast. Words including email, mobile and Facebook are in decline, it said. They are being replaced by the likes of Instagram, Snapchat and emoji. And the word television has now been superseded by phone. The report also notes a sudden new arrival in children's sentences. The use of the hashtag symbol # to add an extra meaning or comment at the end of a sentence has become commonplace. #IblameTwitter #AndInstagram. Vineeta Gupta at the Oxford University Press said: \"This has been a significant change in usage in this year, 2015. \"Children have extended its [#] use from a simple prefix or as a search term for Twitter to an editorial device to add drama or comment.\" Other words on the technological endangered list are iPod, mp3 and Blackberry. In their place are iPhone, chat app WhatsApp and messaging site ooVoo. #keepup One of the most common plotlines in the short story competition was achieving sudden internet fame after posting a YouTube video. Rather than writing about watching videos, stories revolved around how many hits, shares and likes they were receiving for their own videos. #makesabetterstory Some of the most popular characters were Cinderella, footballer Lionel Messi, Snow White, Adolf Hitler and Wayne Rooney. What surprised researchers was how many children wrote using mythological characters such as Zeus, the Minotaur and Hercules. #theyloveZeus As a source for stories, World War One was common and world events in Ukraine and Syria were both popular but far behind the most frequent current affairs topic, Ebola.

That's all I can say.\" Slade would like to make up to three signings during the window to aid Bluebirds' push for a Championship play-off place, with the club currently four points off the top six. One is likely to be a striker after the departure of last season's top scorer Kenwyne Jones to Al Jazira in the United Arab Emirates. The Trinidad and Tobago international claimed on social media that the club had offered him no fresh deal to stay, but Slade believes that was not the case, \"I'm pretty sure there was a dialogue going on between Kenwyne's people, Kenwyne himself and [chief executive] Ken Choo and the board of directors,\" Slade added. He also denied claims from Rotherham Manager Neil Redfearn that the two clubs are in talks over a potential transfer for Alex Revell. Revell, 32, joined Cardiff from Rotherham in January 2015 and has scored twice in 15 league games for the Bluebirds. \"We've already lost a target type centre forward,\" said Slade. \"We need to be mindful that we're not shooting ourselves in the foot and that we have enough players in every position and every area of the pitch.\" Cardiff host League One Shrewsbury Town on Sunday in the third round of the FA Cup with defender Lee Peltier a major doubt because of illness.",
        "The walk-in service is aimed at reducing doctor appointments and to help reduce the over-use of antibiotics, NHS England said. It is hoped the scheme could result in fewer visits to GPs -potentially saving the NHS millions of pounds a year. But pharmacies say cuts in funding to the sector could jeopardise the scheme. The Sore Throat Test and Treat service, which has been trialled in 35 Boots pharmacies, will determine if an illness is caused by a virus - meaning drugs will not help - or a bacterial infection. Results from a throat swab, which measures sugars on the tongue, are provided in five minutes. Patients who can be helped by antibiotics will be prescribed them by the pharmacist and not have to see a GP. NHS chief executive Simon Stevens said the scheme will be rolled out across the country over the coming year. Dr Adam Roberts, a microbiologist at University College London specialising in antibiotic resistance, told the BBC it was \"quite an innovative step\". He said: \"Anything that reduces our reliance and our inappropriate use of antibiotics is a good thing. \"The initial data they showed using this kit showed that of around 360 individuals that took part only 36 were given a prescription, which is a massive reduction.\" Claire Ward, chairwoman of Pharmacy Voice, which represents the trade, welcomed the roll-out and said it was the \"kind of thing community pharmacies should be undertaking\". But she warned that cuts to services could prevent the scheme from working. In October, the Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee told the BBC that the government had drawn up proposals to cut funding by 12% from December. The Department of Health said no final decision had been made. The throat test is one of eight medical innovations being introduced to help the NHS modernise in the face of increasing demand. Sir Bruce Keogh, NHS England's national medical director, said \"innovation is not an option but a necessity if we are to build a sustainable NHS\". \"The innovations selected for this programme have",
        "The Sakurajima volcano on Japan's Kyushu island poses a \"growing threat\", researchers at the University of Bristol say. The volcano, located 49 km (30 miles) from the Sendai nuclear plant, is also close to Kagoshima, a city of 600,000. Sakurajima's last deadly eruption was in 1914, when 58 people died. The Japanese archipelago, which sits on the Pacific \"Ring of fire\", has more than 100 volcanoes. Sakurajima regularly spews ash and there are many small explosions there each year, with the latest eruption being in February. It is closely monitored by Japanese authorities and one of two volcanoes at Level 3 out of 5 levels in Japan's volcanic warning system, which means that people are warned not to to approach the volcano. \"The 1914 eruption measured about 1.5km cubed in volume,\" said the study's lead author Dr James Hickey, who has now joined the University of Exeter's Camborne School of Mines. \"From our data we think it would take around 130 years for the volcano to store the same amount of magma for another eruption of a similar size- meaning we are around 25 years away.\" A report on the activity of the volcano was published on Tuesday and teams from Bristol University and the Sakurajima Volcano Research Centre took part. Their research showed that 14 million cubic metres of magma is accumulating each year, enough to fill London's Wembley Stadium 3.5 times over. They added that the rate at which the magma is accumulating is faster than it can be expelled in its regular smaller eruptions, which led them to infer that a major eruption is likely in the next 30 years. They made these assessments based on new ways of studying and modelling the volcano's magma reservoir. Scientists say they hope these findings can help authorities plan for major eruptions. \"We know that being forewarned means we are forearmed and providing essential information for local authorities can potentially help save lives if an eruption was imminent,\" said Dr Hickey. According to an associate professor at Kyoto University, new evacuation plans have already been prepared. \"It is already passed by 100 years since the 1914 eruption, less than 30 years is left until a next expected big eruption\", said Dr Haruhisa Nakamichi, Associate Professor at the Disaster Prevention Research Institute, Kyoto University. \"Kagoshima city office has prepared a new evacuation plan from Sakurajima.\""

        "Maj Richard Scott, 40, stands accused of recklessly driving at speeds reaching 95mph (153km/h) in treacherous weather conditions before a catastrophic accident on a B-road in Wiltshire. Tragically, 24-year-old Gareth Hicks suffered fatal injuries when the van in which he was sleeping was violently struck by Mr. Scott's Audi A6. Maj Scott has denied the charge of causing death by careless driving. Prosecutor Charles Gabb alleged that the defendant, residing on Green Lane in Shepperton, Surrey, veered across the carriageway of the B390 in Shrewton, near Amesbury, where the speed limit is 60mph. The weather at the time was described as \"awful,\" with fierce winds and heavy rain, Mr. Gabb informed the jurors. Witnesses described Mr. Scott's car as \"twitching\" and possibly \"aquaplaning\" before colliding with an initial vehicle, a BMW driven by Craig Reed. Subsequently, Mr. Scott's Audi returned to the correct side of the road only to veer across again, ultimately colliding head-on with a Ford Transit van, where Mr. Hicks, from Bath in Somerset, lay asleep en route to a construction site in Salisbury with his co-worker, Patrick Gilleece of DR Groundworks. \"There is no doubt that when the Audi smashed into the panel van, it was entirely on the wrong side of the road,\" Mr. Gabb asserted. The court heard that Maj Scott sustained \"substantial injuries\" and claimed to have no memory of the crash, which occurred shortly after 07:00 GMT on 6 October 2014. He disputes the charge, suggesting instead that it was Mr. Reed who had crossed the carriageway, instigating the fatal collision. The trial continues.",
        "The decision to ban Islamic face veils, backed by local authorities in Urumqi as reported by state media, marks another step in the ongoing campaign against Islamic clothing and symbols in this predominantly Muslim region. The Chinese government has attributed several recent attacks to Uighur militants, while activists argue these violent outbreaks are a reaction to Chinese repression. The Uighurs have a history of practicing a moderate form of Islam, but recently, influences from the Gulf and Pakistan have introduced stricter interpretations, leading to an increase in women wearing face veils. As noted by the BBC's Asia Pacific editor, Charles Scanlon, Chinese authorities view the veil as a symbol of defiance amidst escalating violence in the area. Earlier this year, Karamay, a northern city, prohibited men with long beards from using public buses. Some analysts suggest these measures could exacerbate tensions, as many Uighurs feel their cultural identity is under siege. James Leibold, an expert on China's ethnic policy from Melbourne's La Trobe University, remarked to Reuters that the ban could inadvertently elevate the veil to a potent symbol of resistance and ethno-national identity. He pointed out that China's Communist Party has equated certain Islamic dress styles with religious extremism. The new regulation in Urumqi will be enforced following regional approval. China's authorities link a recent surge of violence, including attacks on civilians in public spaces, to Uighur militants allegedly influenced by foreign terrorist organizations. This has led to a severe crackdown in Xinjiang, resulting in numerous arrests and imprisonments. However, Uighur activists contend that China's heavy-handed approach, including cultural and religious oppression, only intensifies the discord. The tension between China and the Uighurs remains a complex and deeply rooted issue.",

Regulations stipulate that horses may only receive hay, feed, or water before a race, with other substances like electrolytes permitted only post-race. Following a report by the Equine Welfare and Integrity Officer, Palmer and his staff, along with fellow trainers Francois Rohaut and Jean-Claude Rouget, were interviewed by stewards. Palmer is still awaiting the BHA's decision regarding any penalties. \"I expect a routine fine for the breached rule,\" he told BBC Radio Berkshire. \"There is no indication of any attempt to gain an unfair advantage or cheat. The rules are clear, and adherence is essential.\" BHA media spokesperson Robin Mounsey explained: \"Among the substances, three are electrolytes permissible in the stables, though clearance was not obtained beforehand, while the other substance is allowed in training but not on race day.\" All horses involved, including Signs Of Blessing, Architecture, Galileo Gold, and Almanzor\u2014winner of the Champion Stakes\u2014underwent routine testing.

Though she fervently denied the accusations, a disciplinary panel concluded that contact had likely occurred, deeming her behavior \"unacceptable.\" On a fateful Thursday, the Education Workforce Council decreed a temporary suspension, yet expressed hope for her eventual return to teaching, stating, \"The public interest is in favor of her being able to teach again.\"\n\nMrs. Hungerford confessed to raising her voice and slamming a book onto the desk of the \"provocative and disruptive\" youth, yet staunchly maintained her innocence regarding any physical blow to his head. Her name was cleared of criminal charges following an appeal, absolving her of assault during a maths class designed for those with learning difficulties. Nevertheless, the November disciplinary panel, weighing the balance of probabilities, determined she had engaged in some form of physical contact with the student, whether upon his head or hand. Their verdict was one of professional misconduct, a stain upon her career.\n\nDuring the hearing, this mother of three implored for the preservation of her \"very rewarding\" vocation. She spoke of the allegations as a profound \"miscarriage of justice\" that had marred her existence, yet her passion for teaching remained undiminished.

        "At a somber gathering on Thursday, the air was thick with the weight of memory as she spoke to honor four men whose lives were violently extinguished by the SAS in her quaint home village of Clonoe in 1992. The solemnity of the event seemed to echo through the cobblestone streets, where whispers of the past lingered like ghosts in the mist. DUP leader Arlene Foster voiced her disapproval, her words as sharp as the chill in the air, expressing that Mrs. O'Neill's presence was both wrong and predictable. Unyielding, Mrs. O'Neill stood her ground, her voice a steady flame against the cold scrutiny, declaring, \"There are some who would say we have no right to remember or honor them, yet we have every right. Everyone, regardless of who they are, possesses the right to remember their dead in a respectful and dignified manner.\"\n\nThe tragic events of that fateful February day in 1992, when four IRA men met their end under a barrage of gunfire after attacking the Coalisland police station, cast long shadows over the gathering. The soldiers' bullets had torn through the air as mercilessly as the unforgiving winds of winter, leaving behind echoes of violence and grief.\n\nAmidst this charged atmosphere, Ulster Unionist Party's Mid Ulster candidate, Sandra Overend, voiced her criticism, her words carrying the weight of a longstanding divide: \"It is only to be expected that republicans would wish to remember their dead, but Michelle O'Neill's presence at such an event is hardly sending a signal to the unionist community that she represents a new direction for Sinn Fein.\" An Alliance Party spokesperson chimed in, offering a plea for peace amidst the gathering storm, \"While people will naturally want to mark those who died during the Troubles, it is vital that in doing so, the focus",

The inspectors, like vigilant sentinels, descended upon the force in a quest to assess its response to last year's government spending cuts, only to find the situation precarious. Police and Crime Commissioner Olly Martins, with a voice tinged with frustration, dismissed the report as \"out of date,\" a relic of past assessments failing to capture the current tides of change.\n\nIn the HMIC's \"Policing in Austerity: Meeting the Challenge\" report from the previous year, Bedfordshire Police had been cast in the shadow of needing improvement. Upon their October return, inspectors scrutinized the force with a keen eye, finding it languishing behind its peers.

        "The Royal couple commenced their day of public engagements with a visit to the Giant's Causeway in County Antrim, a UNESCO World Heritage Site renowned for its approximately 40,000 large black basalt columns rising majestically from the sea. This marked their inaugural visit to Northern Ireland's most celebrated tourist attraction. The formation of the causeway is attributed to the eruption of molten rock through earth fissures, resulting in a lava plateau. Subsequently, Her Majesty the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh proceeded to the nearby village of Bushmills to honor local hero Robert Quigg. Sgt Quigg was awarded the Victoria Cross for acts of bravery during the Battle of the Somme, notably for risking his life under enemy fire in search of his commanding officer. In commemoration, the Royal couple unveiled a statue of Sgt Quigg and a commemorative stone, with his grandnephew, Leonard Quigg, delivering a brief address. Following this ceremony, they attended a reception at Portrush Golf Club as esteemed guests of the Mayor of the Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council.\n\nThe day's itinerary continued with a nostalgic journey on a steam train from Coleraine, County Londonderry, to the village of Bellarena, where large crowds assembled to welcome the Royal visitors. Accompanied by local schoolchildren, the Royal couple traveled on the 1932-built five-carriage train to Bellarena, where Her Majesty officially inaugurated the village's new train station. The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh originally traveled this historic Coleraine to Londonderry railway line in 1953, coinciding with her coronation year. The original station dates back to 1853. Earlier this year, Bellarena saw the addition of two new railway platforms as part of a \u00a346 million upgrade to the railway line. Upon her arrival, the Queen unveiled a plaque signifying this development, greeted by well-wishers who lined the route, waving Union flags and cheering.\n\nOn Monday, Her Majesty met with Northern Ireland's First and Deputy First Ministers at Hillsborough Castle in County Down.

        "The Institute of Public Policy Research, or IPPR, recently highlighted a striking difference in educational performance between London\u2019s poorest children and those in the North. Surprisingly, kids from less privileged backgrounds in London are outshining their northern counterparts. This revelation comes as the centre-left think tank unveils its report in Sheffield. The government has responded by channeling more funds into early years education to bridge this gap. The IPPR report lays out a series of crucial benchmarks, or \"tests,\" for the government's Northern Powerhouse initiative, aimed at boosting the region's economy. Their research reveals that only 47% of children from the poorest families in the north reach a satisfactory level of early development, compared to 59% in London. Yet, the North is not short on talent. Five northern city-regions together boast almost as many well-qualified people as London does. But here\u2019s the catch: demand for skilled workers in the North is on the rise. To address these challenges, the IPPR has set forth 11 benchmarks for Chancellor George Osborne's initiative, emphasizing the need to close this \"stark\" early development gap. IPPR's director, Ed Cox, puts it plainly: \"A powerhouse economy is out of reach if our children and young people start at a disadvantage.\" He advocates for a generational investment\u2014not just in infrastructure like railways and roads, but crucially, in the education and training that build the North\u2019s \"human capital,\" starting from the youngest age. For the Northern Powerhouse to truly succeed, economic powers must be spread across the region, enabling businesses and policymakers to cultivate a thriving, resilient economy. This means jobs that offer good pay, shared prosperity, and opportunities for everyone. On their end, the Department for Education has pledged commitment to ensure every child, no matter their background, can achieve their potential. Since 2010, reforms have led to 250,000 more pupils attending good or outstanding schools",

But North isn't ready for that narrative. \"All George wants is to be back on the field, playing the game he loves,\" asserts Mallinder with conviction.\n\nThis isn't North's first brush with head injuries. Not long ago, he endured a grueling six-month hiatus after a series of concussive blows, including a severe hit while scoring against Wasps in March 2015. This latest incident means North will miss Northampton's Boxing Day clash with the Sale Sharks, despite his insistence that he wasn't knocked out. \"He recalls everything\u2014soaring through the air, hitting the ground, even his head impacting the turf,\" Mallinder explained to BBC Look East. \"It's not that he denies being briefly unconscious; George is astute enough to acknowledge if he felt concussed.\"\n\nA specialist's assessment on Tuesday revealed no symptoms, yet the potential of an unconscious episode mandates caution. Out of an abundance of care, North won't see action for the next couple of weeks. A concussion review group is examining how the situation was managed, assessing if the club has any responsibility. Mallinder, however, remains optimistic. \"I trust the ensuing report will reflect positively on our medical team and club.

During his inaugural season in county cricket, Rossouw chose not to disclose whether his departure was influenced by Cricket South Africa, stating enigmatically to BBC Sport, \"Maybe, maybe not. I think that story is one I'm going to tell at a different time.\" Under Kolpak contracts, athletes from countries with associate trade agreements with the European Union enjoy the same rights to free movement as EU citizens. Consequently, they are not classified as overseas players, but they forfeit their eligibility to represent their country at the international level. Their decisions were made prior to Britain's exit from the EU, positioning Abbott and Rossouw among several South Africans who transitioned ahead of the new domestic season. Joining them are all-rounder Simon Harmer with Essex, Stiaan van Zyl and David Wiese with Sussex, and fast bowler Hardus Viljoen with Derbyshire. \n\n\"Right now, I'm just going to enjoy life here in England,\" Rossouw remarked, as he prepared to embark on a three-year contract with Hampshire. \"I'm enthusiastic about the season. I'm 100% committed to my decision, and I don't foresee that changing any time soon. My home is in England, and I hope to remain here beyond the next three years with Hampshire.\" For Abbott, a four-year deal signifies a return to the county he last played for as an overseas signing in 2014. \"I made a lot of friends here during my last stint, and it just felt like the right place for me,\" said the right-arm pace bowler. Although Abbott was visibly emotional when announcing his international retirement following South Africa's home series win against Sri Lanka, he shared at Hampshire's pre-season media day that he had reconciled with his decision well before it was finalized. \"I've been comfortable for a long time, to be honest,\" he noted. \"Hampshire has always felt like home to me.

As the South Korean company scrambles to manage the crisis, we revisit the unfolding events: \n\nOn August 2, Samsung unveiled its latest flagship model, the Galaxy Note 7, with much fanfare in New York. The phone boasted innovative features, including an iris scanner, and received an initially positive response, with high expectations as it positioned itself as a formidable contender to the upcoming iPhone 7. \n\nSales commenced on August 19 across ten markets, including South Korea and the United States, with European releases slated for October. However, by August 24, reports emerged of a Note 7 device \"exploding,\" soon followed by numerous incidents of phones overheating, exploding, or catching fire, as documented by users through pictures and videos.\n\nIn response, Samsung announced a voluntary global recall on September 2, affecting approximately 2.5 million Note 7 phones due to faulty batteries, offering customers either a refund or replacement. On September 8, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and various airlines worldwide advised passengers against turning on or charging the Note 7 during flights. By September 9, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission recommended halting the use of the phone, formalizing the recall on September 15. Meanwhile, Samsung stated it would resume Note 7 sales in South Korea on September 28. \n\nDespite assurances that phones sold in China used different batteries not subject to recall, reports of devices catching fire surfaced on September 19. Sales resumed in South Korea on October 1, and replacements were actively underway in the U.S. However, on October 6, the first report surfaced of a replacement Note 7 experiencing similar issues, as a device emitted smoke on a Southwest Airlines flight, leading to evacuation.

        "The capital's firefighting capabilities face a significant shift with the proposal to remove engines that have remained inactive for two years, leaving 142 operational vehicles. The savings from this initiative are intended to bolster staffing for Fire Rescue Units. However, the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) has criticized the plan as \"dangerous and reckless,\" warning against the permanent removal of these engines. In response, the London Fire Brigade (LFB) has presented three potential plans to achieve the necessary savings. They assure the public that no fire stations will close, nor will any firefighters be forced out of their roles. The LFB has maintained that they have consistently met city-wide attendance time targets even while the 13 engines were offline. According to their analysis, the reactivation of these engines would enhance response times by approximately four seconds for the first engine arriving at an emergency scene. In contrast, London Assembly Member Andrew Dismore has suggested an alternative, advocating for the reintroduction of the 13 engines alongside implementing alternate crewing at stations with certain specialized appliances to achieve financial savings. The proposals are slated for discussion on December 2, accompanied by a comprehensive public consultation on the Brigade's approach to cost-saving measures. The FBU remains firmly against the removal of any fire engines from London. A spokesperson emphasized, \"In light of the recent Paris attacks, reducing the number of fire engines would be both dangerous and reckless. We urge the London Fire Brigade to reconsider.

This gathering will also serve as the international debut for the newly inaugurated Philippine government under President Rodrigo Duterte. The Department of Foreign Affairs stated that Mr. Yasay, acting on behalf of Mr. Duterte, will \"discuss the Philippines' peaceful and rules-based approach to the South China Sea within the context of Asem's agenda, emphasizing the necessity for parties to respect the recent decision.\" This marks the Philippines' most assertive response to the ruling to date. Unlike his predecessor Benigno Aquino, Mr. Duterte has adopted a more conciliatory stance, expressing a willingness to jointly exploit natural resources with China in disputed regions if the tribunal's decision favored the Philippines. The ruling was initially hailed as a \"milestone decision,\" though without overt jubilation. Meanwhile, China, which claims nearly the entire South China Sea, has dismissed the summit as \"an unsuitable venue for discussing the issue.\" Assistant Foreign Minister Kong Xuanyou told Reuters that \"it should not be put on the agenda.\" The tribunal's decision was the result of an arbitration case initiated by the Philippines under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), to which both nations are signatories. The ruling determined that China had infringed upon the Philippines' sovereign rights and inflicted \"severe harm to the coral reef environment\" through the construction of artificial islands. Although the ruling is binding, the Permanent Court of Arbitration lacks enforcement capabilities.",
        "\"It's been a grand showcase of the positive, strong, and commendable attributes of Wales,\" remarked Mr. Crabb. He emphasized that the collaboration with the Welsh government and First Minister Carwyn Jones had been \"remarkably effective.\" Their shared resolve ensured that everyday politics did not overshadow Wales' united front. Over two days, the Celtic Manor Resort hosted more than 60 world leaders, 4,000 delegates, and 1,500 journalists, marking one of the largest international gatherings ever held in the UK. Mr. Crabb elaborated, \"We aimed to present the world with the finest of Welsh hospitality, infrastructure, and facilities, and I believe we've accomplished just that this week. Our objective was to ensure the NATO summit leaves a lasting economic imprint on Wales, and the global spotlight on us this week is a step towards that goal. The upcoming investment summit, spurred by the NATO event, is our next stride towards attracting more inward investment. Hosting global leaders, prime ministers, and ambassadors here was integral to that strategy.\" The UK Investment Summit, slated for November 20 and 21, will also be convened at Celtic Manor. On Thursday, US President Barack Obama commended the warm Welsh reception, celebrating the nation's \"extraordinary beauty, wonderful people, and great hospitality.\" While there is optimism about long-term gains for Wales, Cardiff traders expressed concerns that security barriers and road closures had negatively impacted their businesses by deterring customers both leading up to the summit and during it. First Minister Carwyn Jones extended his gratitude to residents and businesses for their support and patience amidst the unavoidable disruptions. \"This has been a remarkable week for Wales,\" he declared. \"President Obama provided us with significant affirmation, lauding the extraordinary beauty, wonderful people, and great hospitality of our country, and pledged to encourage US citizens to visit Wales. Our priority now is to maintain this momentum.\" Cardiff council assured that city center security barriers would be removed by Sunday afternoon. As part of the summit's promotional efforts, world leaders received willow baskets brimming with gifts from Wales. Accompanying these was a note from Prime Minister David Cameron: \"I hope you will enjoy each of these gifts and be inspired to discover all that Wales has to offer.\" The contents of the basket included:",

Much like the trusted companion Siri on iPhones, Google Assistant allows users to explore the vast expanse of their apps and quench their thirst for knowledge with just a question. The revelation that LG would be among the first to integrate this cutting-edge companion into its new device, the G6, sent ripples of anticipation through the tech world. As if unlocking a door to endless possibilities, Google's announcement that the update would begin rolling out this week to millions of users wielding Android 6.0 Marshmallow or 7.0 Nougat was met with eager excitement. \"With this update, hundreds of millions of Android users will now be able to try out the Google Assistant,\" exclaimed Gummi Hafsteinsson, the visionary product lead for Google Assistant, in a blog post that resonated with promise.\n\nYet, the landscape of virtual assistance is a vivid tapestry, rich with diverse colors. At the illustrious Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Lenovo Moto unveiled its plans to introduce Amazon's Alexa assistant to the Moto Z, a move that would be realized through a transformative MotoMod, a testament to the ever-evolving nature of technology. Not long before, at the CES tech show in Las Vegas, the formidable Chinese tech giant Huawei declared its intention to embrace Alexa, weaving it into the fabric of its future devices.\n\nDistinctly, Google Assistant stands apart, crafted to engage users in rich dialogues, encouraging follow-up questions and fostering a symbiotic conversation. \"It is a natural step for Google to offer Google Assistant to as many smartphones as possible because AI is at the heart of Google's strategy,\" observed",
        "The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) expressed its intention to announce the winner of the election by Monday, despite the myriad challenges plaguing the process. The United Nations lauded the election, even amidst technical failures, civil disturbances, and violence attributed to Boko Haram. The voting process extended into a second day in numerous regions of Nigeria due to complications with newly implemented electronic card readers. President Jonathan was notably unable to cast his vote through this technology, which was instituted as a safeguard against electoral fraud. The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), which had initially opposed the adoption of these card readers, denounced the situation as a \"significant national embarrassment.\" INEC's chairperson, Attahiru Jega, underscored that the malfunctions affected only a minor portion of the 150,000 card readers deployed nationwide.\n\nThe election, already deferred by six weeks due to the Boko Haram insurgency, witnessed attacks on polling stations in the northeastern states. In response to the ensuing clashes between security forces and the insurgents, a curfew was imposed in Bauchi State. Despite the turmoil, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon commended the \"determination and resilience\" demonstrated by Nigerian voters, acknowledging that the voting process was \"largely peaceful and orderly.\" His sentiments were echoed by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), which urged the Nigerian populace to embrace the election results.\n\nNonetheless, tensions simmered in Rivers State in the south, where mass protests erupted over allegations of opposition worker killings and voting irregularities. INEC expressed its \"concern\" over these grievances, revealing that one of their offices was torched during the resultant unrest. As the counting process continued through Sunday night, the official results remained undisclosed, leaving the nation's political future in suspense. Historically dominated by the PDP since 1999, Nigeria's political landscape faced a formidable challenge from General Buhari's All Progressives Congress.

Among the rolling mists and whispering winds, Geoffrey Stewart, aged 74, of Dumfries, embarked on what would be his final journey. Together with his steadfast companions, George Crosbie, 73, and Bobby Thomson, 64, the trio ventured into the embrace of the hills on a Tuesday, only to be swallowed by the elements.\n\nGeoffrey's earthly journey drew to a close late on a solemn Wednesday night within the confines of Dumfries and Galloway Royal Infirmary. The gentle light of George Crosbie's life dimmed earlier that same day, while Bobby Thomson clings to his fragile tether in the care of vigilant professionals. In the wake of such sorrow, the Stewart family extended a heartfelt embrace, enveloping the families of the fallen in love and thought during this poignant moment. With gratitude etched in their hearts, they acknowledged the tireless efforts of the rescue services and the compassionate hands of the hospital staff.\n\nThe hills of Durisdeer, ever mysterious and capricious, bore witness to a determined search as sixteen valiant members of the Moffat Mountain Rescue team, alongside two loyal search dogs, scoured the terrain beneath a shroud of relentless rain, snow, and tempestuous winds. At the break of dawn, when the skies reluctantly brightened, the search resumed with renewed vigor. Over fifty souls, including neighboring mountain rescue teams and a vigilant Coastguard helicopter, joined the quest. Their perseverance bore fruit that afternoon when the missing were discovered and whisked to the hospital by the wings of a helicopter.\n\nYet, the cruel hand of",
        "The landscape of employment has seen a modest yet telling shift between January and March, as the number of unemployed individuals gently descended to 1.69 million, a slight dip of 2,000 from the previous quarter. The jobless rate, steadfast at 5.1%, whispers stability amidst change. Meanwhile, the army of the employed swelled to 31.58 million, an admirable climb of 44,000, setting the employment rate aglow at a record-breaking 74.2%. Yet, the horizon is not without its clouds; job vacancies slipped by 18,000 to 745,000, a retreat not witnessed in nearly a year, as per the ONS.\n\nDavid Freeman, a stalwart voice from the ONS, observed, \"The employment rate has hit another record high, but this time the increase is quite modest.\" His words hint at a cooling breeze over the once-fiery jobs market. In the realm of earnings, there lies a silver lining\u2014average earnings, entwined with bonuses, rose by 2% compared to last year, offering a subtle boon from the previous 1.9% in February. The timing of bonuses, the ONS remarked, played its part in this quiet crescendo. Stripping away bonuses, earnings growth edged to 2.1% year-on-year come March, a gentle fall from February's 2.2%.\n\nApril painted a slightly different story, with jobless benefit claims retreating by 2,400 to 737,800. Yet, a glance back reveals a stark rise of 14,700 between February and March\u2014the steepest ascent since autumn 2011. Stephen Crabb, the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, heralded the figures as record-breaking, with more people in work than ever and unemployment nestling at its lowest in a decade.\n\nHowever, not all share in this celebratory chorus. David Kern of the British Chambers of Commerce cast a wary eye over the scene, suggesting that beneath the triumphant employment rates lurks a softening economic pulse, with manufacturing, trade, and GDP whispering tales of caution. Paul Hollingsworth of Capital Economics echoed this sentiment, noting that while bright spots exist, the broader view suggests an economic slowdown dampening the once-robust jobs recovery.\n\nYet, a measured voice emerges from Martin Beck, senior economic adviser to the EY Item Club. \"With the unemployment rate back to the pre-crisis average,\" he muses, \"it would be unrealistic to expect the rapid drops",
        "Tatenda Taibu, 32, a former cricket player for Zimbabwe, left an indelible mark during his career, playing 28 Test matches and 150 One-Day Internationals before retiring in 2012. His unexpected approach to Hightown St Mary's, a Second Division cricket club, was met with initial disbelief. \"When he explained who he was, I thought it was a hoax,\" remarked Nick Gordon, Hightown's publicity officer. \"As our conversation progressed, we gathered references from the cricket community in Zimbabwe, and we've been in touch ever since. It's a remarkable acquisition for us.\"\n\nTaibu, a seasoned wicketkeeper-batsman, is poised to debut for the team against Alder on April 24. Speaking with BBC Radio Merseyside, Gordon recounted how Taibu responded to the club's advertisement for an overseas player for the summer. \"It's not every day a club like Hightown St Mary's signs a player of Taibu's caliber,\" Gordon exclaimed. \"I had to do a double take; it was so unexpected. Our ad targeted young players, but he candidly stated, 'I'm not a young player, I'm a retired Test cricketer.' Despite not having played since 2012, his experience is more than adequate for our summer needs.\"\n\nThe surprising signing of Taibu, who amassed 1,546 runs in his Test career, sent ripples of shock through Hightown and their competitors alike. \"Initially, there was utter disbelief,\" Gordon said. \"The players thought it was a prank, but excitement has grown over time. Opportunities like this are rare at the club level.\" The move has even stirred envy, with social media abuzz with curiosity. \"These are guys with regular jobs, facing an international Test captain on weekends. It's a fantastic boost for local cricket.\"",
        "On Tuesday, the hashtag #penuriecarburantdansunfilm, which translates to \"fuel shortage in a film,\" surged to the top of France's Twitter trends, amassing over 5,000 tweets. This digital buzz mirrors the reality of a nationwide strike over new labor laws, which has halted operations at all eight of France's oil refineries, leaving an estimated 20% of petrol stations either dry or critically low on fuel. French social media users cleverly connected this shortage with the world of cinema, referencing films like Total Recall\u2014a title shared by both a 1990 and a 2012 science fiction film\u2014as a nod to Total, the French multinational oil and gas giant. Playful creativity emerged as users reimagined film titles: Pulp Fiction became Pump Friction, The Full Monty turned into The Fuel Monty, and Mad Max: Fury Road was humorously rebranded as Mad Max: Fury Bicycle Lane. Actor Vin Diesel was a focal point, with inventive revisions of his Fast and Furious franchise, including Last and Furious, Pas Fast Mais Furious (Not Fast But Furious), Immobile and Furious, and Fuel Furious. Even Eminem\u2019s semi-biographical drama, 8 Mile, wasn\u2019t spared, becoming 0 Mile and 8 Miles \u00e0 Pied (8 Miles on Foot). Stanley Kubrick\u2019s work also inspired creativity, with Full Metal Jacket transformed into Fuel Metal Jacket, and the French title of 2001: A Space Odyssey, 2001, l'Odyss\u00e9e de l'espace, humorously linked with Renault's Espace minivan. Images of people filling jerrycans at petrol stations sparked further puns, resulting in titles like Tom and Jerrycan, Jerrycan Beauty, and Catch Me If You Jerrycan.

        "In the bustling corridors of Sydney airport, a scene unfolded that epitomized a growing shadow hanging over Australia's skies. Immigration Minister Peter Dutton stood gravely, recounting the tale of a 17-year-old boy who, a mere fortnight ago, had been halted on his path to the war-torn landscapes of the Middle East. The young man was not alone in his journey; rather, he was part of a nefarious trend, a burgeoning threat as more Australians, like moths to a flame, were lured by the siren call of extremist groups like Islamic State (IS).\n\nIn a bid to stem this tide, special anti-terror teams had been strategically deployed across the nation's eight international airports since August. Under their vigilant watch, the teenager was sent back to the arms of his parents, his fate hanging in the balance as investigations loomed. His thwarted departure echoed eerily, coming just a week after two other Sydney youths, brothers aged 16 and 17, were intercepted under similar circumstances. Their identities cloaked in anonymity, the siblings too found themselves back in the familial fold, leaving a trail of unease among the parents at their prestigious school, where they resumed their studies amid whispers of concern.\n\nThe airport's bustling terminals have become arenas of scrutiny, with anti-terror units engaging some 85,000 travelers since their deployment. Yet, despite these efforts, Australia grapples with the grim statistic that approximately 90 of its citizens have already vanished into the clutches of IS in Iraq or Syria, with 20 of them meeting their demise on foreign soil. Among these tragic tales is the haunting narrative of Melbourne teenager Jake Bilardi, whose name reverberates with sorrow and disbelief. His father, John Bilardi, spoke with a heavy heart on Australia's 60 Minutes, painting a picture of a \"loner\" son who harbored a chilling \"death wish.\" To IS, Jake was more than a recruit; he was a \"trophy,\" paraded in the digital realm as a testament to their reach,",
        "The amnesty pertains to offenses committed during the political unrest following Mr. Thaksin Shinawatra\u2019s removal from office in a coup. The House of Representatives passed the contentious bill in the early hours of Friday, and it now awaits consideration by the Senate. The opposition Democrat Party has cautioned that the bill's enactment could incite public demonstrations. While the party abstained from voting, the bill was approved with a unanimous vote of 310 to 0. According to Jonathan Head, the BBC\u2019s Southeast Asia correspondent, the bill\u2019s progression in the Senate is uncertain, given that half of its members are appointed. However, it could be ratified as early as next week, potentially inciting further protests.\n\nProponents argue that the bill will mitigate the political discord that ensued from the 2006 military coup that deposed Mr. Thaksin, leaving Thailand deeply divided. This period of unrest encompassed the occupation of Bangkok's main airport in 2008 and two months of street protests in 2010, resulting in approximately 90 fatalities, predominantly among civilian protesters. Conversely, critics contend that the amnesty would allow human rights violations to remain unpunished. Brad Adams, Asia Director of Human Rights Watch, remarked on 21 October, \"The proposed amnesty would allow officials and protest leaders who have blood on their hands to go unpunished. By whitewashing past abuses, the government denies justice to victims and tells future abusers they have little to fear.\"\n\nThe opposition believes the bill is designed to facilitate Mr. Thaksin\u2019s return without serving a prison sentence. Mr. Thaksin has resided in self-imposed exile since his 2008 conviction on corruption charges, which he maintains are politically motivated. Originally, the amnesty was confined to ordinary protesters charged with involvement in past street clashes but was unexpectedly broadened two weeks ago to encompass individuals investigated by agencies established after the 2006 coup. It was due to one of these investigations that Mr. Thaksin was sentenced, as reported by our correspondent.\n\nIn the aftermath of the coup, Mr. Thaksin retained his popularity among rural voters, and parties allied with him have succeeded in both general elections since. His sister, Yingluck Shinawatra, currently serves as the Prime Minister. The opposition intends to contest the legislation. \"We will continue our fight in the street until the bill is aborted. There are other avenues, such as petitioning the Constitutional Court,\" stated Democrat Party spokesman Chavanond Intarakomalyasut. On Thursday, as the bill was under debate, thousands gathered in protest outside a railway station.",
        "Forest Enterprise Scotland is embarking on an ambitious project to plant acorns around Loch Trool and the Cree Valley over the coming years, with the goal of cultivating approximately 600,000 young trees. This initiative aims to establish a \"large and vibrant habitat,\" thereby enhancing local biodiversity. Environment forester Gareth Ventress explained that upon realizing the potential for a \"bumper crop\" of acorns, they promptly began organizing their collection strategy. To maximize the impact, additional support was solicited from staff across Scotland, who gathered acorns from other native oak woods within the national forest estate. Collaborative efforts by the Cree Valley Community Woodland Trust, Borders Forest Trust, and Moffat Community Woodlands further bolstered the collection, facilitating the expansion of native woodlands in southern Scotland.\n\nBy sourcing acorns from various locations within Galloway Forest Park, the project enhances the genetic diversity of the newly planted trees, strengthening the ecological links between remnant woodlands. This diversity is crucial for developing robust, resilient forests capable of withstanding pests and diseases in the long term. The collection process involves spreading large felt nets on the forest floor to keep acorns off the soil, simplifying retrieval. After collection, the acorns are carefully sorted and stored. Over the next three to four years, the viable seeds will be germinated and nurtured into saplings. Although some seeds will be deemed infertile and discarded during this period, it is anticipated that around 600,000 healthy saplings will result from this endeavor. These new oak woods will significantly enhance the woodland habitats throughout Galloway Forest Park, fostering a richer ecosystem.",
        "Mr. Carney emphasized the critical role of long-term financing for green projects in emerging markets as a means to enhance financial stability. During his speech in Berlin, he urged Germany to leverage its G20 presidency in 2017 to spearhead progress in this area. Mr. Carney, who has consistently highlighted the financial industry's vulnerabilities to climate change, noted that while capital theoretically should flow from developed to emerging economies due to higher returns, the reality has been quite the opposite. This trend has suppressed bond yields in advanced economies. When investments occasionally shift to emerging markets, they often lead to instability. He identified green finance as a significant opportunity to reverse this pattern. By directing capital towards long-term projects in regions with intensive carbon growth, financial stability can be bolstered. Mr. Carney projected that the issuance of green bonds\u2014such as those financing water and renewable energy projects\u2014could potentially double from the previous year\u2019s $42 billion, yet they still comprise a mere 1% of global financial institutions' portfolios. He described the creation of this global asset class as a chance to foster a low-carbon future, increase global investment, and stimulate growth. However, he warned of a paradox: waiting for clear economic incentives to combat climate change might render action too late. Additionally, he cautioned that an abrupt shift to a low-carbon economy could disrupt financial stability. To facilitate this transition, Mr. Carney advocated for companies to disclose the financial risks climate change poses to their business models. He reiterated concerns that climate change represents a significant threat to the finance sector, particularly if most fossil fuel reserves become stranded assets as global efforts to curb warming intensify.",

The escape involved prisoners Richard Matt and David Sweat, who utilized power tools to break free from the Clinton Correctional Facility. A large-scale manhunt continues as authorities seek the two escapees, both of whom are convicted murderers. Mr. Palmer is currently being held on bail after a court appearance where he faced charges of promoting prison contraband, tampering with physical evidence, and official misconduct. His attorney, Andrew Brockway, acknowledged that Palmer delivered the meat containing the contraband tools, asserting that Palmer was unaware of its contents or the prisoners\u2019 escape plans. \"He did pass the hamburger meat. He shouldn't have done it. He apologized for it,\" Mr. Brockway stated, indicating his client's intention to plead not guilty. Clinton County District Attorney Andrew Wylie explained that Ms. Mitchell had concealed hacksaw blades and other tools inside the meat, which Mr. Palmer then delivered to Matt and Sweat, housed in a jail section allowing inmates to prepare their own meals. Meanwhile, law enforcement efforts are concentrated on a 75 square mile (194 square kilometer) area in northern New York State. Investigators discovered evidence that the fugitives had spent time in a hunting cabin near the prison and may now be armed, given the area's abundance of weaponry. \"They are extremely dangerous and cunning,\" remarked New York State Police Major Charles Guess. \"Why wouldn't they try to arm themselves",
        "The party's election manifesto stipulates that a funding floor will be introduced only after a referendum is convened. The St David's Day Agreement described such a vote as an \"expectation,\" while Welsh Labour ministers oppose a referendum preceding a funding agreement. Labour has accused the Conservative Party of exerting undue pressure, likening it to holding them \"over a barrel.\" The manifesto articulates that the Conservatives intend to \"implement a 'funding floor' to safeguard relative funding for Wales and ensure fiscal certainty for the Welsh Government's future planning, contingent upon the calling of a referendum on Income Tax powers in the forthcoming Parliament.\" However, a Welsh Conservative spokesperson clarified to BBC Wales: \"Our commitment, stemming from the St David's Day Agreement, to instate a funding floor for Wales is unequivocal and steadfast. Efforts are already underway within the Treasury and the Wales Office to advance this initiative. The establishment of the funding floor for Wales is not dependent on an income tax referendum. Our UK manifesto clearly anticipates that the Welsh Assembly will conduct a referendum concerning income tax powers early in the next Parliament. Additional details of our comprehensive plan for Wales will be unveiled in the Conservative Party's Welsh Manifesto, which is set to be launched later this week.\" \n\nOn Friday, Chancellor George Osborne informed BBC Wales that the funding floor would range from \u00a3113 to \u00a3116 per capita for every \u00a3100 spent in England, consistent with economist Gerry Holtham's recommendations. Labour has similarly pledged to establish a funding floor for the Welsh Government, although it has not committed to a specific amount. In response to the Conservative manifesto, First Minister Carwyn Jones remarked: \"A vote for the Conservatives equates to endorsing a government that could cost Wales up to \u00a3300 million annually. A fair funding settlement is inherently either equitable or it is not\u2014you cannot impose conditions or exert coercive force.\" \n\nThe Liberal Democrats have proposed commissioning an independent review of Wales' funding arrangements to potentially increase the Welsh Government's budget. Plaid Cymru advocates for an additional \u00a31.2 billion per annum for the Welsh Government, asserting that such an increase would align spending with Scottish levels.

        "One possible future scenario envisions a shift from individual ownership of cars and bikes to a model where transportation is predominantly hired. This concept was recently exemplified in London with the launch of oBike, a company backed by substantial venture capital. oBike has introduced hundreds of hire bikes to the streets of London, with plans to expand to thousands by the end of the summer. Having already implemented large-scale operations in Southeast Asia, oBike distinguishes itself from existing cycle hire schemes by offering bikes that do not require docking stations. Instead, these bicycles are equipped with a locking rear brake, allowing them to be left at any location. Users access and locate the bikes via an app with GPS functionality. oBike's service requires a one-time refundable deposit of \u00a349 and charges 50p per half-hour of use. \n\nThe company's objective is to complement existing schemes while pursuing a social agenda aimed at improving London's air quality and reducing emissions. Collaboration with Transport for London (TfL) and local councils is part of oBike\u2019s strategy; however, this has not yet materialized. Certain councils have expressed frustration over the lack of consultation, describing the bikes as having been \"dumped\" without prior notice. Despite general support for cycle hire, Hackney Council raised concerns about the potential for bikes to obstruct pavements and roads due to their docking-free nature and noted an absence of communication with oBike. Similarly, Hammersmith & Fulham Council reported that approximately 400 bikes appeared in their borough without prior warning. Council leader, Cllr Stephen Cowan, emphasized the importance of proper consultation, stating that the launch could have been better planned. Subsequently, oBike agreed to remove the bikes from the borough.\n\nThis situation reflects a broader trend of friction between local authorities and emerging technology companies. City Hall's response to oBike\u2019s initiative has been cautious. Will Norman, London's Walking and Cycling Commissioner, emphasized the importance of collaboration with TfL and borough councils to ensure the scheme benefits all Londoners without negatively impacting other cyclists, road users, or pedestrians. While such schemes have the potential to enhance cycling accessibility, their introduction must be tailored to suit the capital\u2019s unique context.",
        "On Wednesday, the Confederation of African Football's Executive Committee appointed Gabon as the host nation for the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations, surpassing competing bids from Ghana and Algeria. Jean-Felix Mba Nze, a Gabonese football official, expressed the country's resolve: \"We are committed to winning the Nations Cup in 2017. Our ambition is not only to participate but to triumph.\" Gabon's journey in the Nations Cup began in 1970, yet they did not reach the finals until 1994. Their most notable achievements were reaching the quarter-finals in 1996 and 2012, the latter being a tournament they co-hosted with Equatorial Guinea. During this year's Nations Cup, also held in Equatorial Guinea, the Gabonese team, known as the Panthers, were eliminated early, securing one victory and suffering two defeats in the group stage. The 2017 tournament will mark the first occasion Gabon hosts the finals independently. \"Our primary objective is to organize a superior tournament compared to 2012,\" stated Mba Nze, the Secretary-General of the Gabonese Football Federation, in an interview with BBC Sport. \"We believe our successful bid stemmed from a compelling presentation and substantial improvements in our stadiums, healthcare facilities, and media infrastructure. We have advanced significantly since the last Nations Cup.\" Gabon plans to utilize two existing stadiums from the 2012 finals, located in Libreville (with a capacity of 45,000) and Franceville (25,000), and will introduce two additional venues. The new stadiums in Port Gentil and Oyem, each accommodating 20,000 spectators, are projected to be completed by August 2016, five months ahead of the competition. The decision to award Gabon the hosting rights was met with discontent from the other bidding nations. The Algerian media criticized the outcome, with Algeria Soir describing it as a 'sporting and political setback for Algeria,' while El Watan contended that Algeria's proposal lacked adequate political endorsement. The Ghanaian bid team expressed 'intrigue' over the decision and called for increased transparency in the selection process, questioning why the Confederation of African Football (Caf) did not disclose the voting results. In response, Caf clarified that it did not release voting outcomes during the announcement of host countries for",

Yet, they tread a delicate line; with an expenditure exceeding that of the casual attendee by \u00a345 per event, 46% voice concerns of festivals succumbing to corporate encroachment.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, a symphony of over 100 festivals, from the iconic Glastonbury and T In The Park to intimate affairs like the Cambridge Jazz Festival and Jamie Oliver's Big Feastival, beckons a staggering 3.7 million participants annually, according to Music UK. This veritable cornucopia of celebrations fuels more than 39,000 full-time jobs, yet beneath its jubilant veneer lies a landscape fraught with challenges. The tumultuous summer of 2012 saw 57 festivals, including Oxegen and The Big Chill, extinguished by inclement weather, their echoes lingering in the annals of festival lore. Though the rate of cancellations has abated, the specter of closure looms, as evidenced by the disappearance of events such as the Temples Festival, Down To The Woods, and Field Day, with Sonisphere remaining in hiatus since 2015.\n\nYet, amidst the shadows, a beacon of hope glimmers. The latest research casts a reassuring light for festival organizers, with 88% of respondents pledging their allegiance to the return of festival revelry next year, and over half aspiring to indulge in even more. \"It has been a challenging year for some festivals, with inclement weather conditions, general economic uncertainty following Brexit, rising expenditure, and heightened security concerns,\" reflects Paul Reed, steward of the Association of Independent Festivals. \"This research illustrates that the sector remains buoyant, that festival promoters are resilient, and will continue",
        "Certainly! Let's transform this paragraph into a more dynamic and engaging narrative for a spoken presentation:\n\nLadies and gentlemen, let's turn our attention to the recent turmoil that unfolded in Cromer over the weekend. Picture this: 37 crimes recorded, including the harrowing rape of a teenager, all pointing to a single group\u2014a group of travelers that has everyone talking. Now, Suffolk Constabulary had their eyes and ears open. They sent out a warning to Norfolk Police before the group even set foot in town. Norfolk, in turn, acknowledged the heads-up and is now reflecting on its actions\u2014or perhaps, inactions.\n\nThe drama began when Suffolk officers flagged the group after issuing them a notice to vacate Lowestoft due to previous disturbances. Norfolk was in the loop, but no one knew which direction the group would head next.\n\nOn Friday, as shadows lengthened, a young woman faced a terrifying ordeal at a bus stop near the picturesque seafront on Cadogan Road. Evidence suggests a possible link to the chaos spreading through Cromer. Norfolk Police have made one arrest, but the investigation continues, leaving many questions unanswered.\n\nBy Saturday night, whispers turned into a buzz. A taxi driver confided in a BBC reporter, painting a vivid picture of travelers \"rampaging\" through the town, while staff at The Wellington pub shut their doors after a group of 30 travelers got \"rowdy.\" Local business owners like Lee Sale, of the beloved ice cream shop, described a scene straight out of a thriller, with families intimidated by the travelers' behavior. Meanwhile, Ayrun Nessa, from the Masala Twist restaurant, recounts an unsettling encounter at her doorstep with six women hurling abuse.\n\nIn response, Cromer's Safer Neighbourhood Team is opening its doors, inviting residents to voice their concerns directly to the officers.

        "Sure thing! Here's a more engaging and conversational version of your paragraph:\n\nSo, here's the scoop: a survey found that about a quarter of new dads aren't taking any paternity leave at all. And if you look at those who do, fewer than one in 10 actually take more than the basic two weeks. The folks over at the Institute of Leadership & Management (ILM) dug into why this is happening, and they think it's mainly because of old-fashioned attitudes from employers. Plus, new dads are worried they can't afford the time off. Now, last year, the government rolled out this plan to let parents share their leave\u2014big changes are coming in April 2015. But the ILM is sounding the alarm that unless we change how employers think, these new rules won't do much. Charles Elvin, the ILM's chief, pointed out that sharing parental leave is key if we want more women to climb the career ladder. Still, he said there are cultural barriers, like the expectation that women, not men, will be the ones staying home. The report also highlights that low paternity pay is a big turn-off, with only 9% of dads getting more than two weeks of full pay. Frances O'Grady from the TUC chimed in, saying pay is the real issue here. She noted that lots of dads just can't swing the time off because their employers don't usually cover the gap in pay. Right now, dads can get one or two weeks paid leave, and maybe more if the mom's back at work. But the government wants to push this further, allowing parents to swap and share leave. A government spokesperson mentioned they hope this will spark a cultural change, encouraging dads to get more involved early on. They also believe that employers will benefit by keeping talented women on board and having more enthusiastic and productive staff.",
        "As with the previous year\u2019s parade, only the Orangemen and their 13 notified bands are permitted to march past St Patrick's Church on Donegall Street in north Belfast, and they must do so to the sound of a single drum beat. This year, all music must cease 43 meters away from the church to ensure it is not within earshot. Additionally, a planned residents' protest is limited to a maximum of 50 people at two designated locations. The Orange Order expressed its dismay at this decision, stating, \"The commission is simply a mouthpiece for republican propaganda, allowing them to dictate when, how, and where loyal order parades are held. The newly invented criteria of banning music within 'earshot' of a non-operational place of worship is both mischievous and absurd, clearly aimed at further censoring Protestant heritage on the supposedly shared streets of Northern Ireland's capital city.\" North Belfast MP Nigel Dodds of the DUP criticized the Parades Commission\u2019s decision, calling it \"a bureaucratic monstrosity that has lost its way, catering solely to the demands of republican residents, or possibly a perilous mix of both.\" He added, \"It is evident from the document that the Parades Commission seriously contemplated banning music outside Clifton Street Orange Hall. I wish that statement was a joke, but it is not.\" In contrast, SDLP assembly member Alban Maginness supported the decision, stating, \"This determination by the Parades Commission is sensible and hopefully sets the tone for this year's marching season. Throughout this dispute, all the parishioners of St Patrick's and the residents of Carrick Hill have requested is to be treated with respect.\"",
        "The 34-year-old midfielder recently concluded his tenure in the Indian Super League with Atletico Kolkata. McFadden, who has been with the club multiple times, mentioned the attraction of returning to the team and confirmed that Motherwell has extended an offer to him. Pearson, having started his career at Fir Park, has played for several teams including Celtic, Derby County, Bristol City, and Karela Blasters, before rejoining Motherwell for a season in 2015. Currently a free agent, Pearson contributed to Kolkata's fourth-place finish in the Indian league and secured a title through a play-off win against his former club, Karela. Motherwell's tradition of welcoming back former players is supported by McFadden, who noted Pearson's potential positive impact both on and off the field. McFadden expressed hope for Pearson's return, acknowledging that he has considerations to address before making a decision. Recently, Motherwell acquired winger Elliot Frear from Forest Green and secured loans for Reading defender Zak Jules and Everton goalkeeper Russell Griffiths. The club continues to seek additional players as the transfer window remains open. McFadden stated that ongoing discussions are in progress, and they await responses from potential recruits.",

While authorities initially deemed his tragic demise an accident, Kevin\u2019s family remained resolute in their belief that the telltale injuries bore the sinister fingerprints of murder. This conviction led to a thorough appraisal of \"all information known\" concerning his death, sparked by interactions between the family and Chief Constable Phil Gormley. The police embarked on a meticulous review, delving into the shadows of that fateful night and speaking with individuals who, until then, had lingered in the periphery of silence.\n\nKevin\u2019s mother, June, voiced her unwavering determination to the BBC Scotland, asserting that should this assessment yield no fresh revelations, the family would persist in their quest for a renewed investigation. A distinct evaluation was commanded by the chief constable, scrutinizing the police's handling of the Mcleod family's grievances over the years since 1997. Detective Chief Superintendent Gareth Blair, head of major crime at Police Scotland, articulated that the assessment was conducted \"in recognition of the continued impact\" of Kevin's passing on his bereaved parents and \"their desire for a conclusive outcome.\" He expressed, \"Our sympathies remain with them.\"\n\nIt was imperative to clarify that this endeavor was not a sweeping reinvestigation but a deliberate and thoughtful examination of a vast array of records tied to the circumstances surrounding Kevin\u2019s death. Specialist officers from Police Scotland's major crime command undertook this task, revisiting Wick and engaging with those who had once crossed paths with Kevin and had yet to step into the light. Detective Chief Superintendent Blair conveyed to Kevin's parents the somber conclusion of the assessment. \"I informed Kevin's parents that having carried out this assessment, there is no evidence of criminality, and his death remains unexplained, leading me to determine that there is no basis on which to launch a full reinvestigation,\" he stated solemnly. Nonetheless, Police Scotland continues its appeal for any witnesses to emerge with information regarding Kevin's untimely death, pledging to thoroughly consider any new insights. Meanwhile, the chief constable has tasked the head of professional standards with conducting a separate review to ensure that every concern raised by the family over the years has",

The tragic incident occurred in April 2013, when the victims were found deceased in their sleep aboard a boat on Windermere. Mr. Eteson, 42 years old and a resident of Hale in Greater Manchester, has pleaded not guilty to the charge. The family had traveled to the Lake District to celebrate a friend's birthday during the Easter bank holiday weekend.\n\nOn the afternoon of April 1, Mr. Eteson reportedly removed a generator from the deck, using it to power a 1kW fan heater intended to warm the sleeping quarters, according to prosecutor Mr. Graham Reeds QC. The court was informed that there was no warning of the toxic gas accumulation because the carbon monoxide sensors had been previously disabled. Mr. Reeds noted that the mother and daughter, both from Leyland in Lancashire, were discovered in their sleeping positions aboard the second-hand Bayliner 285 motor cruiser Arniston, with fatal concentrations of carbon monoxide present in their bodies.\n\nMr. Eteson, sleeping in a separate compartment further from the generator, also suffered from carbon monoxide poisoning but eventually awoke and discovered the bodies. The court heard that Mr. Eteson, a qualified gas fitter, had made modifications to the generator and its exhaust, which experts later classified as \"dangerous.\" Ms. Webster's mother, Nia Webster, had previously inquired about the carbon monoxide sensors, to which Mr. Eteson responded that they were inoperative, and that his partner would unplug a portable",
        "NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) has emphasized the critical importance of blood group O negative, which is indispensable in emergency situations, as it is compatible with patients of other blood groups. O negative blood constitutes 12% of transfusions, despite only 7% of the UK population possessing this blood type. Additionally, there is a pressing need for B negative blood, particularly within ethnic minority communities. These groups, which are more likely to have B negative blood, have a heightened susceptibility to sickle cell anemia\u2014a condition characterized by misshapen blood cells obstructing blood vessels, potentially leading to premature mortality. Moreover, they face an increased risk of thalassemia, a hereditary blood disorder that impairs the blood's oxygen-carrying capacity. Although only 2% of Britain's population has B negative blood, hospitals have experienced a 6% increase in its usage over the past four weeks compared to the same period last year. B negative blood is advantageous, as it can be used for both B negative and B positive individuals.\n\nDonna Batty, the Donor Relations Manager at NHSBT, has issued an urgent appeal for donors to come forward in the \"next few days,\" noting that the reserves for \"these vulnerable groups\" are \"lower than we would like.\" Ms. Batty further urged individuals with forthcoming appointments to honor them. She expressed optimism, stating: \"We hope our dedicated donors respond to this appeal and remain patient if there are slightly longer waits than usual during sessions as a result.\" \n\nCurrently, only 4% of the UK's population donates blood. Jon Latham, Assistant Director of Marketing at NHSBT, expressed a desire to attract \"first-time donors\" to expand the donor database, thereby facilitating the process of reaching out during periods of specific blood group demand.

        "Dr. Stephen Farry, the Employment and Learning Minister, has made the controversial decision to eliminate a special premium payment of \u00a31.1 million, previously granted to compensate for small-scale and specialist institutions. This decision impacts a college with fewer than 1,000 students and an annual income of \u00a34.7 million. Protesters argue that the removal of this premium, in conjunction with a broader reduction in Department of Employment and Learning (DEL) funding, would result in a staggering 31% budget cut for the college. However, a recent announcement of an additional \u00a332 million for the DEL slightly alleviates the situation. The college estimates that with this extra funding, its budget would only decrease by 26.5%, a marginally improved outlook but still a significant challenge according to Principal Prof. Peter Finn. He criticizes Dr. Farry's decision as opportunistic, aimed at pressuring the college into accepting one of his proposed plans for streamlining teacher training in Northern Ireland. None of these plans allow St. Mary's to maintain its current autonomy, though the institution remains committed to preserving its unique character and Catholic ethos. Prof. Finn is open to \"very deep sharing\" among teacher training institutions, suggesting that students might occasionally attend classes at other university colleges. He contests the notion that small-scale and specialist premiums should be abolished solely because they are unique to Northern Ireland, highlighting that similar institutions in England had their premiums removed only after being allowed to charge higher tuition fees and increase student intake\u2014freedoms not granted to St. Mary's. Meanwhile, Stranmillis University College, which predominantly trains teachers for non-Catholic schools, faces similar challenges. Yet, it has been negotiating a complete merger with Queen's University since 2008, a process fraught with opposition and still awaiting approval. This reduction in funding and removal of the premium would also affect Stranmillis, complicating its financial landscape.",
        "The Welsh government has committed nearly \u00a315 million to an investment aimed at commencing production by late 2018. Economy Minister Edwina Hart emphasized that this initiative will \"safeguard more than 750 skilled Welsh jobs for many years.\" She noted that, amidst intense global competition, efforts were made to secure a portion of this investment for Wales. Ford's decision to produce its new innovative engine in Wales reflects positively on the local management's reputation and the Welsh workforce's quality and loyalty. The Ford Bridgend plant, operational since 1980, has successfully contended for investments totaling over \u00a32.8 billion. The company reports that its presence supports approximately 10,000 jobs in South Wales, with 1,860 employees directly at the plant. Collaboration between technicians in Essex and Germany has led to the development of a new range of fuel-efficient engines. A letter from Ford to its workers, disclosed by the BBC in June, mentioned that winning the investment necessitated changes in working conditions at Bridgend to enhance competitiveness. The Welsh Conservative shadow economy minister, William Graham, regarded the announcement as an endorsement of the UK government's economic revival efforts. The impending production in 2018 offers promising prospects for Bridgend workers, coinciding with the conclusion of Jaguar Land Rover engine manufacturing at the site, thereby securing hundreds of jobs that were at risk. Earlier this year, Ford Bridgend released 200 fixed-contract workers following the cessation of Volvo engine production. However, concerns exist that the new investment may limit Bridgend's engine manufacturing capacity to just a third of its current output. Some question the Welsh government's decision to invest \u00a315 million in a plant owned by a multinational corporation. Bridgend competed with three other European Ford plants for the project, all of which received governmental financial support as a norm. In the fiercely competitive global automotive industry, such backing is crucial to retaining company operations locally.",
        "The lifeblood of S4C flows primarily from the license fee, a revenue stream now under the scrutiny of UK ministers as they embark on a significant review of the BBC's future. Amidst the swirling tides of budgetary evaluation, Monmouth MP David Davies stands as a vigilant sentinel, asserting to BBC Wales that S4C is a \"special case,\" its essence interwoven with the very fabric of the Welsh language. In a climate where ministers urge S4C to pursue cost-saving measures akin to those faced by the BBC, a storm of concern brews. On Thursday, Labour voices a clarion call, warning that the scythe of budget cuts poised over the BBC could cast long shadows on S4C's vitality. Yet, Culture Secretary John Whittingdale, addressing MPs, extends a beacon of reassurance, expressing a steadfast commitment to the channel over the ensuing years, and anticipates fruitful dialogues with its leadership shortly. In the gentle cadence of BBC Radio Cymru's Rhaglen Dylan Jones, Mr. Davies articulates the government's cognizance of S4C's pivotal role, not merely as a broadcaster, but as an enduring bastion of the Welsh language's future. He intimates a potential inquiry by the Welsh Affairs Committee, under his stewardship, into the broader landscape of broadcasting, with S4C under the lens. \"Though these are personal reflections,\" he confides, \"I hold S4C in a realm of its own, as a custodian of linguistic heritage, more crucial than any other BBC channel.\" The channel, having weathered \"substantial cuts\" since the dawn of the last decade, stands poised to underscore its \"uniqueness\" and the profound \"cultural and economic\" worth it embodies in forthcoming ministerial discussions.

Yet, beneath this promising trend, recruiters voiced concerns over dwindling candidate availability, a challenge that threatens to undermine these successes as employers grapple with acquiring the necessary skills. The Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) cautioned that whatever political party assumes control after the June 8 general election must prioritize maintaining access to essential foreign workers while also investing in the domestic workforce.\n\nThis report highlighted a continued growth in permanent placements, marking the third consecutive month of acceleration and clocking in at the fastest expansion rate in 21 months. This stands in stark contrast to a general slowdown observed across the UK. Temporary placements, too, witnessed a striking rise, the steepest since August 2014. However, the availability of workers took a downturn, with the sharpest decline in permanent staff availability seen in nine months, and temporary candidate availability in Scotland falling at the quickest rate in nearly two years.\n\nSpecific sectors such as IT and computing, nursing/medical/care, and hotel and catering experienced the highest demand for permanent staff, while nursing/medical/care, IT and computing, alongside engineering and construction, led the demand for temporary roles. The report also pointed out a significant increase in average salaries for permanent starters in Scotland, with the rate of temporary pay rising at the fastest pace recorded in a year.\n\nREC chief executive Kevin Green commented on the situation, stating, \"The resurgence of the Scottish jobs market continues for the third month running. Demand for temporary staff is at its highest level in nearly a decade as employers navigate Brexit uncertainties and strive to meet consumer demand. The news of rising starting salaries for permanent roles is also heartening\u2014there's much to celebrate north of the border.\" He further emphasized the looming threat posed by declining candidate availability, contending that, \"For British business to flourish, the next government must tackle the shrinking pool of suitable candidates by investing in skills and career guidance for UK jobseekers, as well as ensuring access to essential foreign workers. An agile immigration system, capable of adapting to the shifting needs of the labor market, is crucial for future success.\"",
        "Envoy Sigrid Kaag addressed the situation as Syria appeared to miss a critical deadline to remove its chemical arsenal by the designated date. According to the plan, all of Syria's chemical weapons are slated for destruction by June 30. This initiative stems from a Russian-US agreement formulated in the previous year, following the sarin rocket attack near Damascus that resulted in the loss of hundreds of lives. The comprehensive mission to dismantle Syria's chemical weapons stockpile is supervised jointly by the United Nations Security Council and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). Despite the overarching UN deadline of June 30 for the complete eradication of these weapons, Damascus had pledged to finalize the removal by April 27 after missing several prior deadlines. Ms. Kaag, head of the OPCW-UN Joint Mission, conveyed to the BBC that while a significant portion of the chemical weapons has been removed, it remains imperative to eliminate the residual materials located at a singular site to meet the June 30 deadline. She also expressed concern over reports alleging the use of chlorine gas by Syrian forces, a substance not encompassed within the initial agreement, which is credited with averting potential US military intervention against the Syrian regime. The Syrian government has refuted claims of utilizing chlorine gas as a weapon. The OPCW reports that most of Syria's chemical weapons consist of separate components, which only form lethal agents when combined. Ms. Kaag confirmed that the facilities necessary for the production, preparation, and deployment of chemical weaponry have been dismantled. \"What remains are the constituent elements of a chemical weapon; however, according to the current OPCW declaration under the Chemical Weapons Convention, Syria's chemical weapons program is effectively defunct,\" she affirmed.",

The purpose of the match was to recruit athletes for Mobbs's World War One battalion. A commemorative match is scheduled for January 24, 2015, at Olney Rugby Club. This event will feature players from the East Midlands region competing against The 1st Battalion of the Yorkshire Regiment, while Olney Ladies will play against the Army Women's XV.\n\nEdgar Mobbs was born in Northampton in 1882. He began his rugby career in Olney and later became captain of Northampton Rugby Football Club in 1907. Selected for England in 1909, he scored a try on his debut against Australia and earned seven caps overall. Mobbs advanced from the rank of private to battalion commander, participating in significant battles such as Loos, Somme, Arras, and Messines. He was mentioned in dispatches twice and received the Distinguished Service Order. Mobbs passed away on July 31, 1917, during the Battle of Passchendaele while charging a German machine gun.\n\nAfter retiring from rugby in 1913 at the age of 30, Mobbs was initially denied an officer's commission due to his age when World War One began. He enlisted as a private and was actively involved in recruitment efforts, addressing crowds at Northampton Saints games and persuading over 200 men to enlist. The 1915 international match reportedly inspired hundreds more to join his unit, known as the Sportsman's Battalion, which became part of the 7th Battalion of the Northamptonshire Regiment. Among the recruits were 16 Olney players who lost their lives during the war.\n\nMembers of Mobbs's family, including his great-nephew also named Edgar Mobbs, are expected to attend the 2015 commemorative match.

Currently, the government allocates \u00a322 million annually to support the collection, with the intention for the charity to eventually achieve self-sufficiency. Responsibilities like the listing of buildings will continue to receive government funding. The newly established entity, tentatively named the National Heritage Protection Service, will also provide planning advice. Despite these changes, the charity will retain the name English Heritage, and the 420 sites within the National Heritage Collection, including London's Kenwood House and Charles Darwin's home in Kent, will remain under public ownership.

It was at the home of his dear friend, 51-year-old Dorothy Beattie, that an exchange of words, seemingly innocuous yet charged with emotional weight, spiraled into a calamitous act. The High Court in Glasgow would later hear that Dorothy\u2019s teasing remark about Kelly\u2019s children, laced with derision, became the catalyst for an unforeseeable eruption.\n\nDorothy, a divorced mother and a woman grappling with numerous health challenges, had once relied on Kelly as a support worker. Their relationship had evolved into a genuine friendship, a bond forged through shared moments of vulnerability and laughter within the walls of her modest abode. Yet, on that fateful evening, the sanctuary they had built was shattered in an instant of blind rage. With a force fueled by pain and confusion, Kelly\u2019s hands encircled Dorothy\u2019s neck, extinguishing the light of a life once filled with resilience and warmth. \n\nIn the aftermath of his actions, a heavy silence enveloped the room, broken only by the quiet hum of memories that lingered in the air.

However, this was not the case, resulting in injuries to approximately 35 people. Updates on this developing story can be found on our Local Live pages. The report explains that \"permissive working,\" which allows multiple trains to share a platform, was permissible for passenger trains on platform six. The signaller, observing from the signal box window, mistakenly estimated that the moving train could fit alongside the stationary one. A contributing factor was the relocation of one train to platform six because passenger lifts on other platforms were closed for maintenance. As the moving train approached Plymouth, it accelerated to about 21 mph and navigated a relatively tight left-hand curve. At this point, the driver unexpectedly saw the stationary train's rear close to the west end of the platform. Realizing a collision was imminent, he checked the tracks to confirm the train's route and applied the emergency brake approximately three seconds before the collision, which occurred at around 15 mph. Many passengers, standing in preparation to disembark, were thrown against the train's fixtures and onto the floor.",
        "The paragraph provides a detailed overview of the recent Ugandan election, highlighting the main candidates, election results, and the controversies surrounding the process. However, to enhance clarity, coherence, and argumentative strength, several areas could be refined. Here is a polished version:\n\n---\n\nThe Ugandan presidential election results have sparked significant controversy, as 71-year-old incumbent President Yoweri Museveni secured 60.75% of the vote, compared to his closest rival Kizza Besigye's 35%, according to the election commission. Supporters of President Museveni argue that his opponents failed to present a viable alternative for progress. In stark contrast, Mr. Besigye, who remains under house arrest, condemned the election results as a \"sham\" and urged the international community to reject them. He asserted, \"We have just witnessed what must be the most fraudulent electoral process in Uganda.\"\n\nAdding weight to Besigye's claims, EU observers criticized the election, highlighting the \"intimidating atmosphere\" allegedly fostered by the ruling party, which purportedly engaged in vote-rigging tactics. Despite acknowledging the \"remarkable determination\" of Ugandan voters, EU Chief Observer Eduard Kukan noted that the National Resistance Movement's dominance skewed the campaign's fairness. The election period was further marred by reports of sporadic violence and allegations of electoral fraud, exacerbated by the blocking of social media sites and messaging apps.\n\nMr. Besigye, representing the opposition Forum for Democratic Change, faced house arrest on suspicion of intending to prematurely announce election results, potentially breaching electoral laws. This marks the fourth electoral challenge he has mounted against President Museveni. Historically, Besigye and Museveni were allies, with Besigye serving as Museveni's personal doctor during their time as guerrilla fighters. President",
        "The retailer's ambitious proposal for Chippenham promises to inject a substantial boost into the local economy, pledging the creation of 1,000 new jobs and an annual contribution of \u00a331 million. Yet, the plan has sparked a whirlwind of debate among the five candidates aspiring to represent the area in Parliament. Opinions are sharply divided: one candidate firmly opposes the development, while three others harbor reservations about its proposed location. This contentious issue has galvanized the community, with thousands of local residents signing petitions both in support of and against the proposal.\n\nConservative candidate Michelle Donelan expressed a nuanced stance, acknowledging the merits of both perspectives but criticizing the recently concluded consultation process as insufficient for a project poised to transform the town dramatically. The fate of the planned 72,000 square meter regional center now rests with Wiltshire Council, though the issue took center stage during a lively election debate broadcast by BBC Wiltshire.\n\nLabour's Andy Newman endorsed the development, bolstered by assurances of 700 permanent skilled jobs and potential wage increases in the region. In stark contrast, Green Party candidate Tina Johnston expressed vehement opposition, casting doubt on the projected job figures as overly optimistic.\n\nTwo candidates, while supportive of the development plans, voiced concerns regarding its location. Julia Reid of UKIP proposed relocating the project closer to the motorway, distancing it from the town center to mitigate any adverse impact on local businesses. Meanwhile, Liberal Democrat Duncan Hames welcomed the prospect of new employment opportunities but remained uncertain about the suitability of the site.\n\nAs",
        "The 31-year-old artist took to Twitter to express her dismay after allegedly being refused service by a black cab driver, who directed her to \"find an immigrant\" for transportation. This incident follows her prior public apology addressing the deplorable conditions at the Jungle camp in Calais. The Licensed Taxi Drivers' Association has denounced any form of abusive conduct, underscoring the seriousness with which they regard such allegations. The singer recounted her experience on Twitter, stating: \"I attempted to enter a black cab with my children, only to be met with the driver's derogatory remark, 'find an immigrant to drive you, you stupid tart'.\" She further reflected: \"While I have lived a life of privilege, this encounter has offered me a brief insight into the experience of discrimination.\" Her claims have been met with skepticism by some, with one Twitter user asserting it \"definitely didn't happen\" and another requesting the cab's registration details. In response to accusations of \"victim shaming,\" she explained: \"I was unable to access my phone promptly due to having my hands full with children.\" The association, which represents approximately 5,500 black cab drivers in London, has called upon Transport for London to investigate the matter. General Secretary Steve McNamara stated: \"Although it is uncertain whether the driver involved is one of our members, we treat such allegations with utmost seriousness and unequivocally condemn any cabbie who exhibits disrespectful and abusive behavior of this nature. Such conduct places their license at considerable risk.\" Earlier this month, Allen was visibly moved during an appearance on the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire program while conversing with Shamsher Sherin, a 13-year-old Afghan boy. Shamsher recounted his two-month stay at the migrant camp as he awaited reunification with his father in Birmingham, a reunion that occurred approximately a week later. During their interaction, Allen expressed: \"It appears that at three distinct junctures in your life, the actions of the English have placed you in peril. We have bombed your country, entrusted you to the Taliban's hands, and now endangered your safety as you strive to enter our country. I extend my apologies on behalf of my nation.

        "Newly discovered CCTV footage of Charlene Downes, who was last seen at 14 years old in Blackpool town centre, has emerged during a recent review of security recordings. Despite extensive investigations, her body has never been located. Her mother, Karen Downes, expressed frustration over the delayed discovery of the footage after years of inquiries into the unsolved case. Lancashire Police acknowledged Ms. Downes' concerns. To date, no one has been convicted in connection with Charlene's death. The footage release coincides with the anniversary of her disappearance in 2003, as part of the police force's extensive investigation. Ms. Downes questioned why this footage had not been found earlier, expressing both her dissatisfaction and hope that this development may lead to progress in the case. She emphasized the family's desire for closure. Detective Chief Inspector Richard McCutcheon indicated understanding of the family's feelings and explained the timing of the footage release. The video shows Charlene with her sister Rebecca on Bank Hey Street at approximately 15:25 GMT on 1 November 2003, heading toward the Coral Island amusement arcade. She returned home but later revisited Blackpool town centre, where she was last seen. The police confirmed that her attire in the footage matches what she wore when she disappeared. Detective Superintendent Andy Webster stated that officers are investigating potential connections between Charlene's disappearance and broader issues of child sexual exploitation in Blackpool. He noted that several individuals have been identified as possible victims and perpetrators, and efforts are underway to make arrests and pursue prosecutions. A man previously accused of Charlene's murder was acquitted in 2008 following significant doubts about the evidence during a second trial, after the jury in the first trial was unable to reach a verdict. Subsequent reviews by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) identified errors in police evidence collection that contributed to the retrial's collapse. The IPCC reported failures in the strategic and tactical management of the case material, leading to disciplinary actions against several officers, one of whom was ordered to resign in 2011. However, this resignation was later overturned by a Police Arbitration Tribunal in 2012.",
        "In October 2014, at Horton Hospital in Banbury, Julia Knight, aged 56, was accused of attempting to murder her 81-year-old mother, Irene Robson. Although Knight admits to administering insulin, she denies any intention to murder and is currently being tried at Oxford Crown Court. During her testimony, Knight explained her actions stemmed from a desire to prevent her mother's discharge from the hospital, expressing regret over her decision: \"I felt terrible because I knew I was going to make mum unwell. It was a stupid, stupid thing to do. If I could go back and change it, I would.\" Additionally, Knight faces charges of causing grievous bodily harm with intent. In her court appearance, she admitted to deceiving police during their January inquiry and confessed to forging a prescription for insulin, which she procured from a Sainsbury's store in Banbury. When questioned by her defense barrister, Simon Mayo QC, regarding her initial denial of injecting her mother, Knight cited her sense of shame and the gravity of the situation as reasons for her dishonesty. Prosecutor John Price QC contended that Knight had planned to administer a fatal dose of insulin before departing the hospital, challenging her with the question: \"Why did you inject your mother with a substance which for all you knew could kill her within five minutes and do nothing for an hour and twenty minutes?\" Knight responded, asserting that she never intended for her mother to die. She also disclosed a past suicide attempt in 2006, where she injected herself with insulin. Notably, Ms. Robson passed away in September; however, the jury has been instructed that her death bears no relevance to the case at hand. The trial is ongoing.",
        "The Korea Space Launch Vehicle-1 (KSLV-1) soared into the skies from the Naro Space Center precisely at 16:00 (07:00 GMT). Science Minister Lee Ju-ho proudly announced that the satellite, tasked with gathering vital climate data, had settled into its intended orbit. This successful launch follows closely on the heels of North Korea's own controversial satellite deployment using a three-stage rocket, which drew widespread international criticism. South Korea's 140-tonne KSLV-1, affectionately dubbed Naro, was developed in collaboration with Russia, which had committed to assisting Seoul with up to three launch attempts. Previously, launches in 2009 and 2010 ended in disappointment, and the current mission faced two delays due to technical challenges. However, on Wednesday, the launch proceeded smoothly from a site located 480km (298 miles) south of Seoul, with the rocket achieving its target altitude and successfully deploying its satellite. \"After thoroughly analyzing various data, the Naro rocket has triumphantly placed the science satellite into its designated orbit,\" Minister Lee conveyed to the press. He noted that the satellite separated from the rocket 540 seconds post-launch. \"We have now ascended to the ranks of a space-power nation,\" he declared, emphasizing that South Korea will leverage this \"momentous achievement\" to propel its independent space program forward. The satellite, named Science and Technology Satellite-2C, is engineered to gather crucial climate information. According to Yonhap news, it is anticipated to establish contact with its ground station at 05:00 on Thursday, enabling operators to make a conclusive assessment of the mission's success. While South Korea already has satellites in orbit, these were launched from foreign territories. In its inaugural attempt at a domestic launch in 2009, the satellite failed to detach from the rocket once in orbit, and in 2010, the rocket exploded mere seconds after liftoff. The pressure for success intensified after North Korea's 12 December rocket launch, which successfully placed a satellite in orbit and was followed by declarations of a forthcoming \"high-level nuclear test\" and additional long-range rocket launches. The United Nations condemned North Korea's actions as a prohibited missile technology test and responded by extending sanctions against Pyongyang, amidst global appeals for North Korea to abandon its nuclear test plans.",

The Football Association, however, thwarted his ambitions in April, igniting the spark of his public vow. \"When I say something, I mean it,\" he pronounced with the gravitas of a man accustomed to his word being his bond.\n\nTrue to his declaration, within a scant 22 hours following the FA\u2019s verdict, the club was dangled tantalizingly on the market, a testament to his steadfast resolve. Allam revealed that an appeal was being pursued with the Court of Arbitration for Sport, a final gambit in his quest to see Hull Tigers etched into the annals of global football lore. \"Earlier this year, we made it clear that Hull City would be up for grabs if our vision for Hull Tigers as an international brand and team name was thwarted,\" he reiterated. \"And so, following the FA's decision on April 9, I took decisive action the very next day.\"\n\nSince assuming control in December 2010, Allam's tenure had been anything but staid. Asked about his response should a buyer not emerge or the appeal fall on deaf ears, his response was as unyielding as ever. \"I will give it away. Out means I'm out.

According to Jones, as reported by BBC Sport, Harrison has diligently worked on improving his game: \"His last game against Castres was exceptional, and he is likely our first-choice open-side flanker at the moment.\"\n\nIn parallel, Jones has remarked on the prospects of Tom Wood, a flanker who has been recalled to the squad and has a \"great chance\" of being selected this autumn.

When Mr. Trump notoriously dismissed climate change as a mere hoax, it sparked a fervent movement among those who refused to remain silent.\n\nThe @RogueNASA account, a beacon of defiance, boldly proclaims itself as the \"unofficial 'Resistance' team of NASA,\" inviting followers not only for hard-hitting facts but also for the engaging snark that defies political censorship. Meanwhile, the clandestine @ActualEPAFacts account, undoubtedly driven by a deep sense of duty and urgency, contacted by BBC News, revealed their noble mission: to ensure the unfiltered truth about climate change and other critical scientific research continues to echo through the noise of the Trump administration\u2019s suppressive tactics.\n\nThese brave souls, allegedly three EPA employees, took a stand when a silencing gag order threatened to stifle their voices and the invaluable research they carried. In a climate where the Trump administration reportedly attempted to shackle government agencies like the EPA from communicating with the public, the official EPA Twitter account has remained eerily silent since the eve of Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration. Yet, the resounding call for truth has not gone unheard; @ActualEPAFacts has garnered an impressive following of over 90,000 individuals, a testament to the growing hunger for transparency and integrity.\n\nA similar tide of rebellion has swept over other rogue accounts, capturing the imagination and support of the masses. The @RogueNASA account, with its staggering follower count exceeding 370,000, and the rogue National Park Service account @AltNatParkSer, with over a million steadfast supporters, embody a powerful collective yearning for truth and accountability.

        "A report from British Marine, the esteemed representative of the leisure, superyacht, and small commercial marine sectors, paints a vivid portrait of an industry riding the crest of an economic wave as of April 2016. Superyacht revenues surged to a remarkable \u00a3605 million, contributing to a sector-wide revenue increase of 1.6%, culminating in a monumental \u00a33.01 billion\u2014a threshold not breached since the financial doldrums of 2008-2009. Yet, with the future shrouded in the mists of uncertainty, the report casts a shadow, predicting a deceleration in growth throughout 2017, tethered to the enigmatic ebb and flow of Brexit negotiations which cast doubt over demand.\n\nIn the aftermath of the financial tempest, total revenue plunged, touching its nadir in the fiscal year of 2011-2012 at \u00a32.85 billion, only to embark on a slow but steady ascent. It is believed that the propulsion behind this revitalization lies in the increased revenue from engine and equipment manufacturing, coupled with a buoyant surge in hire and charter boat sales. Though exports dipped by a modest 0.7% to \u00a3882 million, British Marine notes the newfound vigor lent by the pound's depreciation against the dollar and euro post-referendum, thereby enhancing the purchasing power of overseas patrons.

However, the main Syrian opposition group has expressed skepticism regarding the agreement. In various parts of Syria, including central Hama province, activists report government airstrikes, while shelling and gunfire continue. The opposition High Negotiations Committee (HNC) criticized the plan for lacking \"safeguards and compliance mechanisms\" and rejected Iran as a guarantor. UN special envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, emphasized the importance of the agreement due to the involvement of three influential countries in its implementation. According to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), Syrian fighter jets conducted airstrikes on rebel positions in Hama, and a rebel commander confirmed renewed fighting, as reported by Reuters. The Syrian military has not commented on these developments. The \"memorandum on the creation of de-escalation areas\" was announced following talks in Astana, Kazakhstan, and Russia's foreign ministry released the agreement's full text. The initiative aims to stop attacks by all parties, facilitate the safe and voluntary return of refugees, and expedite the delivery of relief and medical aid. The zones are intended to remain in place for six months, with their borders to be finalized by Russia, Iran, and Turkey by June 4. Russian Deputy Defence Minister Alexander Fomin stated that no Russian airstrikes have occurred in the designated zones since May 1, although operations against Islamic State (IS) militants elsewhere in Syria will continue. The United States has expressed concerns regarding Iran's involvement, citing its role in exacerbating violence. While the Syrian government, led by President Bashar al-Assad, is not a signatory, it has expressed support for the plan through state media. The Astana talks aimed to reinforce a frequently violated ceasefire initially agreed upon in December. Despite the partial cessation of hostilities declared at the end of last year, conflict persists on multiple fronts. The Syrian war, ongoing since 2011, has resulted in over 300,000 fatalities.",

        "The charity aims to resettle 10% of the 4.8 million Syrians displaced by the civil war by the end of the year. Prior to the upcoming UN talks in Geneva addressing the crisis, the organization emphasized statistics revealing that only 1.4% of these individuals have been assisted thus far. Oxfam criticized the UK\u2019s plan to resettle 20,000 Syrians by 2020 as \"insufficient,\" although the UK maintains its commitment to providing aid to people within the region. With a pledge of \u00a32.3 billion to assist those affected by the Syrian civil war, the UK ranks as the second largest bilateral donor worldwide, following the United States. While acknowledging the UK's substantial financial contributions, Oxfam asserts that the country \"can and should do more.\" The charity argues that nations with robust economies and developed infrastructure should assume greater responsibility for refugees compared to countries like Lebanon and Jordan, which currently host thousands of Syrians. Oxfam insists the Geneva conference must yield \"urgent solutions, offering safe and legal routes to resettlement\" in other countries. In its analysis of pledges made by 28 member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and signatories of the 1951 Convention on Refugees, Oxfam notes that although these nations have committed to resettle nearly 130,000 Syrian refugees, only 67,000 have been relocated. The 10% target set by Oxfam corresponds with the UN's identification of the most vulnerable refugees in need of resettlement. According to Oxfam, only Canada, Germany, and Norway have exceeded their \"fair share\" of resettlement pledges, a measure based on the size of their economies. Furthermore, five other countries\u2014Australia, Finland, Iceland, Sweden, and New Zealand\u2014have committed to more than half of their fair share. In contrast, the UK plans to take in only 22% of its fair share, the US just 7%, and France a mere 4%.

        "The final print edition of Newsweek will be released on December 31, marking a shift towards digital platforms as traditional advertising revenues decline. Two years ago, Newsweek merged with the internet news group, The Daily Beast. Tina Brown, founder of The Daily Beast, announced that the website now receives over 15 million unique visitors monthly, a 70% increase from the previous year. In a statement, she remarked, \"Exiting print is a profoundly challenging moment for those of us who cherish the allure of print and the unique weekly camaraderie experienced during the frenetic hours before Friday night's deadline.\"\n\nOriginally launched in 1933, Newsweek quickly established itself as a prominent weekly magazine covering global events. Over the past 80 years, both the world and the publishing industry have undergone significant transformations, particularly in the way consumers access news. Newsweek's subscriber base has declined from a peak of over 3 million to 1.5 million today. Combined with decreasing advertising revenues for traditional print media, this decline has prompted Newsweek to discontinue its print version. The digital-only Newsweek Global will be accessible via subscription, aiming to reach the 70 million Americans who now use tablet computers, a figure that has surged from just 13 million two years ago. Although the digital market is expansive, increased competition presents challenges, and analysts warn of the difficulty in distinguishing oneself in a digital landscape.\n\nAs Newsweek approaches its 80th anniversary next year, the focus remains on preserving the quality journalism that defines the magazine while embracing a fully digital future. This transition is not a reflection of the brand's or journalism's quality, which remains strong, but rather a response to the financial challenges of print publishing and distribution. Newsweek once held the position of the second-largest news weekly magazine in the United States, following Time. However, declining circulation and advertising led to financial losses, resulting in its sale by the Washington Post Company to Sidney Harman in August 2010, followed by a merger with The Daily Beast three months later. Tina Brown, who became Lady Evans following the knighthood of her husband, renowned journalist Harold Evans, is a former editor of Vanity Fair and The New Yorker.

He, a septuagenarian Conservative councillor, found himself entwined in a web of controversy, his participation with a social housing company casting shadows upon a 2013 debate concerning the future of housing in east Dorset. Despite his assertion that this connection bore no relevance, the court deemed him guilty of illegal voting, a verdict suggesting potential benefits for the company had the debated plans been approved.\n\nYet, in a curious twist of leniency, Flower's standing in public office remains intact. The district judge at Bournemouth Magistrates' Court, while acknowledging his breach of the Localism Act 2011, meted out a mere six-month conditional discharge, supplemented by costs amounting to \u00a3930. Outside the courthouse, Flower, his demeanor a blend of surprise and disappointment, refrained from speculating on his political future. Instead, he lamented the court's decision, attributing his plight to a technicality and emphasizing the absence of personal gain or malintent.\n\nAmidst this legal tempest, Flower's dual role as an East Dorset councillor and a non-executive director of Synergy Housing Ltd\u2014a charitable social housing entity\u2014was scrutinized. During a pivotal vote in February 2013 on the region's core strategy, he declared his affiliation with Synergy, yet his involvement was deemed unlawfully excused due to his financial interests. The strategy, a blueprint for redevelopment in Wimborne, hinted at potential enhancements for Synergy's social housing through developers Wyatt, though no formal planning permissions were in play.\n\nCharged in November, Flower nobly stepped aside from his leadership role at Dorset County Council, intent on confronting the accusations. Other charges, relating to his failure to disclose interests in Zebra Property Solutions Ltd, were dismissed, allowing a glimmer of respite. As the local elections loomed, the future of this embattled councillor remained uncertain, his intentions to stand once more cloaked in ambiguity. Yet, amid the swirling uncertainties, one truth prevails: Spencer Flower continues to navigate the labyrinthine corridors of public service, his saga a testament to the complexities of duty, ambition, and the enduring dance of politics.",

However, following Donald Trump's decisive win in Tuesday's election, his followers noticed that the prophecy had mysteriously vanished from the preacher's Facebook page. Known to his dedicated followers as \"the prophet,\" Mr. Joshua is a wealthy and influential evangelist, celebrated not only in Nigeria but across Africa. His sway extends to high-ranking politicians who count themselves as part of his flock.\n\nThe prophecy regarding the U.S. election was initially broadcast on Mr. Joshua's Emmanuel TV and subsequently uploaded to YouTube by a viewer. A portion of this prophecy had also been shared on his Facebook page, only to be quietly removed later. The original message intriguingly stated, \"Ten days ago I saw the president of America with a narrow win... What I frankly saw was a woman.\"\n\nThe aftermath of the election saw TB Joshua trending across social media platforms in Nigeria, Ghana, and South Africa, where users exchanged memes mocking his prediction. The controversy spilled onto Facebook, with individuals like Clive Mashiri from South Africa questioning, \"Why was the prophecy deleted? If this was uttered by the man of God, why remove it?\" Yet, amidst the skepticism, steadfast supporters like South African Gugu Mathonsi expressed unwavering faith, declaring, \"I will always believe in your prophecies, through thick and thin.\"\n\nTB Joshua's reputed supernatural abilities, which include healing and prophecy, have cemented his fame.

        "Mark Footitt achieved figures of 3-52 as the visitors lost five wickets before lunch, with Sam Curran dismissing England opener Haseeb Hameed for a second-ball duck. Despite this setback, Jordan Clark's unbeaten 108 from 133 deliveries, alongside Shivnarine Chanderpaul's steady 85 not out, revitalized the visitors' innings. Clark reached his century with a commanding pulled six shortly before the close of play. The experienced Chanderpaul, a retired West Indies international, contributed a 55-run partnership with Ryan McLaren, stabilizing the innings after early losses. Following Gareth Batty's dismissal of McLaren, Clark joined Chanderpaul, and the pair forged an impressive unbeaten partnership of 172 runs. Batting at number eight, Clark quickly surpassed Chanderpaul's score, reaching his half-century first. The game was interrupted by poor light in the evening session, but this did not impede Clark's momentum. The 26-year-old, whose previous highest score was 84 not out, struck 17 fours and three sixes during his innings. This turnaround for Lancashire was particularly notable given their precarious position at five wickets down within 22 overs. Footitt, who had previously taken eight wickets in Surrey's season-opening victory against Warwickshire, dismissed opener Alex Davies, Lancashire's stand-in captain Liam Livingstone, and Dane Vilas, with Sam and Tom Curran each claiming a wicket in the initial burst. Reflecting on his performance, Lancashire all-rounder Jordan Clark told BBC Radio Lancashire, \"It's an unbelievable feeling for me. It has positioned us to dig in more tomorrow and hopefully put the team in a good place. It was quite challenging early on against the new ball, but the pitch flattened out a bit when I came in. Tomorrow, the new ball is around the corner, so we still have a lot of work to do.\"",

The opening of 12 new stores contributed to a 7.1% rise in total sales, although this was a decrease from the 11% growth recorded in the previous year. Sales at stores operational for over a year saw a 5% increase, consistent with the prior year. The privately-owned Swedish conglomerate reported that sales in Poland surged by approximately 20%, establishing it as the fastest-growing market, while Australia and Canada also demonstrated strong performance. Germany remained the largest market for the retailer, closely followed by the United States. This year, Ikea is set to inaugurate its first stores in India and Serbia, bringing its total number of outlets to 340 across 28 countries. However, expansion into Russia has been suspended as Ikea addresses \"a number of old legal disputes.\" In the United Kingdom, the chain operates 19 stores and plans to open new outlets in Exeter, Sheffield, and southeast London. In response to evolving consumer behavior, Ikea not only launched 12 new stores but also established 19 \"click and collect\" locations worldwide. This new service allows customers to order items online for home delivery or collection, diverging from the traditional model where customers personally select and transport flat-pack items. According to Verdict Retail, online sales are capturing a larger share of the UK's furniture and floorcoverings market, with a 15% increase last year, now representing over 12% of total expenditure. Earlier this year, Ikea's Chief Executive, Peter Agnefjall, projected that the company would achieve annual sales of \u20ac50 billion by 2020.

        "In the crisp spring air of March 1981, a shocking incident unfolded outside a Washington hotel, etching a grim milestone in history. The bustling street, filled with the echo of footsteps and distant city sounds, was abruptly shattered by the sharp crack of gunfire. Amid the chaos and screams, four individuals, including President Ronald Reagan, crumpled to the ground, injured by the brazen attack. The president, cloaked in the hopes of a nation just weeks into his term, sustained a bullet wound to the lung but miraculously recovered. His press secretary, James Brady, was less fortunate, suffering irreversible brain damage from a shot to the head, confining him to a wheelchair for the remainder of his life. His passing in 2014, a somber reminder of the violence, was officially ruled a homicide, yet no additional charges were pursued against the assailant, John Hinckley Jr.\n\nHinckley, driven by a deluded obsession with actress Jodie Foster, sought to capture her attention through this heinous act. Found not guilty by reason of insanity, he was confined to a Washington hospital where he underwent extensive treatment. By July, over three decades after the incident, a judge deemed him no longer a threat to himself or society, citing comprehensive medical evaluations that revealed no signs of active mental illness since 1983.\n\nUnder stringent conditions, Mr. Hinckley had been gradually reintegrating into society, spending part of each month at his mother's home in Virginia. The air of tension surrounding his release was palpable as he stepped into the familiar yet scrutinized world, the Associated Press capturing his arrival at his mother's home on a Saturday, symbolizing a contentious new chapter in his life.\n\nThe court documents, accessible on",

Like a house of cards, the company crumbled under the weight of its \u00a3660,000 debt, leaving over 230 creditors in disarray. The echo of this financial disaster resonated through the verdant fields and quiet farms of the area, casting a long shadow over the livelihoods tethered to this fallen giant. Newport dairy farmer John Sollis described the situation as a \"disaster,\" a word that hung in the air like a storm cloud over the community owed so much.\n\nThe documents, filed with the solemnity of a funeral procession on the Companies House website, revealed a particularly staggering debt of over \u00a3107,000 to a single livestock trader, while other creditors faced their own daunting five-figure losses. Liquidator Gary Stones, in his report, likened any hope of repayment to a distant mirage, hinging \"totally on the collection of the Irish book debt.\" This lifeline, nearly \u00a3470,000 owed by an Irish firm, seemed as elusive as a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow.\n\nJohn Sollis, who found himself \u00a315,000 deep in losses, lamented not just the financial hit but the logistical nightmare that followed. \"It was a disaster,\" he repeated, his voice laden with frustration. Without a local abattoir, the chore of transporting stock or casualties stretched far beyond convenience to the distant confines of Cross Hands, Carmarthenshire, a costly journey for many.\n\nNFU Cymru President Stephen James, grappling with a loss just over \u00a31,000, spoke of the \"huge blow\" dealt by the abattoir's closure, especially in handling injured cows.

Ben Purdy, a vibrant 18-year-old with dreams and aspirations, met a devastating fate when a moment of confrontation turned fatal. With courage fueled by youthful bravado, he confronted his girlfriend's ex-boyfriend about the menacing messages that had haunted their relationship like a shadow. Little did he know, this act of defiance would seal his fate.\n\nAndrew Bayne, a man of 37 years with a hardened demeanor, and his nephew, the impetuous 22-year-old Michael Bagnall, both from Lewisham, were now cast as the architects of this sorrowful tale. Their guilt, as decided by the court, lay heavy in the air, a testament to the senseless nature of violence. On that fateful November day, a confrontation that began as a \"skirmish\" escalated into a hunt through the streets of Bermondsey, culminating in the unfathomable act of brutality that stole Ben's life in Mossington Gardens.\n\nThe scene was as tragic as it was grim; Andrew Bayne, with cold resolve, aimed and fired, leaving Ben with catastrophic injuries that extinguished his bright spirit the following day. The echoes of that gunshot resonated not just in the physical realm, but deeply within the hearts of those who knew him.\n\nDespite the fact that Michael Bagnall had moved on with a new relationship, the rancor of a love lost continued to fester within him, his bitterness spilling over into threatening messages sent through the digital ether.

The competition, organized by TV channel Dave, has previously seen winners like Tim Vine, Stewart Francis, and Zoe Lyon. Graham, from West Bromwich, secured the win after being shortlisted in both 2014 and 2015. He expressed his excitement, stating, \"It's an incredible honor to land Joke of the Fringe. Not bad for someone from West Brom!\" Comedian Stuart Mitchell placed second with his joke: \"Why is it old people say 'there's no place like home', yet when you put them in one...\" Judges reviewed around 60 different comedy performances and evaluated over 3,600 minutes of material before making their selections.

Partnering with the City Learning Trust, and as part of the free schools programme, the Halle is ready to transform education, pending the green light from the Department for Education.\n\nPicture this: from the first note to the final crescendo, students aged seven to nineteen will dive into a world of music, spending 40% of their time immersed in specialist music classes.

The Belgian broadcaster depicted the march as a \"calm and silent\" homage, a poignant silence that spoke volumes of grief and remembrance. Originally scheduled for a week after the harrowing attacks on March 22, the march had been postponed due to lingering security threats, adding a layer of somber resilience to the proceedings. Among the mourners were the heartbroken relatives of victims, brave paramedics, and dedicated airport staff, all joined by people of various faiths, united in their shared sorrow. Flowers were tenderly carried, their vibrant colors a stark contrast to the somber mood, symbolizing the vibrant lives lost too soon.\n\nThe procession wound its way through the streets, passing the Molenbeek neighborhood\u2014infamously linked to individuals accused of orchestrating the attacks in both Brussels and Paris\u2014culminating at the makeshift memorial outside the city's stock exchange.

Here's a refined version of the paragraph to align with academic standards in terms of clarity, coherence, and formality:\n\nThe company announced that it had received authorization from Senegalese government officials to initiate an evaluation strategy. Cairn Energy, which identified two significant oil discoveries in the region the previous year, projects that the fields could contain in excess of one billion barrels of oil. The evaluation plan is set to commence imminently with a three-dimensional seismic survey. Subsequently, the company intends to embark on a comprehensive exploration and appraisal program involving multiple wells later this year. Based in Edinburgh, Cairn holds a 40% stake in three offshore blocks in Senegal (Sangomar Deep, Sangomar Offshore, and Rufisque Offshore). Its partners in this venture include ConocoPhillips with a 35% interest and FAR Ltd with 15%, while Petrosen, the Senegal National Oil Company, maintains a 10% interest during the exploration phase. In its recent semi-annual report, Cairn also disclosed that it had initiated international arbitration against the Indian government concerning a tax dispute. The Indian authorities have restricted Cairn from accessing the value of its remaining 10% shareholding in Cairn India Limited (CIL). In March, the company was presented with a tax demand amounting to $1.6 billion, plus interest and penalties, pertaining to the fiscal year 2006-2007, a period during which it was preparing to list Cairn India on the Mumbai stock exchange. Cairn has contested this tax demand and intends to seek restitution for the financial losses incurred due to the depreciation of its CIL stake. The decline in oil prices has diminished the value of this stake from $1 billion in December 2013 to $526 million as of 30 June this year. This reduced valuation necessitated Cairn to record an impairment loss of",
        "In response to protests against corruption and security failures, tear gas and live ammunition were employed to disperse predominantly Shia Muslim demonstrators. A curfew was initially imposed by officials in the Iraqi capital, which has since been lifted. This incident marked the second occasion within the month where protesters successfully breached the city's government district. Shia cleric Moqtada Sadr condemned the violent measures used and expressed support for the demonstrators' \"peaceful and spontaneous revolt.\" Reports indicate that at least 50 protesters sustained injuries. The demonstrators accuse the government of neglecting essential reforms amidst its ongoing campaign against the Islamic State group (IS) and decreasing oil revenues. The Sunni jihadist group retains control over areas in western and northern Iraq and has been responsible for a series of recent attacks resulting in numerous casualties. Some protesters infiltrated the prime minister's office and parliament. Baghdad's Green Zone, which houses the parliament, key government buildings, and several foreign embassies, was later reported by authorities to be under full control, with protesters having withdrawn.\n\nShia cleric Moqtada Sadr and his militia, the Mehdi Army, rose to prominence following the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, mobilizing anti-US sentiment. Mr. Sadr's followers frequently engaged in conflicts with US forces, demanding their withdrawal. In 2004, an arrest warrant was issued for Mr. Sadr in connection with the murder of a rival cleric. His militia was also implicated in the torture and killing of thousands of Sunnis during the sectarian violence of 2006 and 2007. Mr. Sadr fled to Iran during this period but returned to Iraq in 2011, adopting a more conciliatory approach and advocating for Iraqi unity and peace.\n\nPrime Minister Haider al-Abadi, who assumed office in 2014, has pledged to eradicate corruption and alleviate sectarian tensions. He has been advocating for substantial reforms and aims to establish a technocratic government, though his efforts have been obstructed by lawmakers, as reported by the BBC's Jim Muir in Baghdad. The deep divisions within parliament have resulted in an inability to convene due to the lack of quorum, according to our correspondent.

        "In this case, presented at Newport Crown Court, Remus Hamza, a 40-year-old Romanian resident of Cardiff, stands accused of raping a 20-year-old woman near Cardiff University. The incident allegedly occurred on 20 September as the victim, separated from her friends, made her way home alone past 2:00 AM. The prosecution argues that the woman was so heavily intoxicated she lacked the capacity to consent to any sexual activity, as articulated by prosecutor Claire Pickthall. Pickthall emphasized that the victim's level of intoxication rendered her incapable of consenting, thus constituting rape under these circumstances. She further described Mr. Hamza\u2019s behavior as predatory, targeting vulnerable, intoxicated women.\n\nThe court also heard testimony from Lee Neill, an eyewitness who observed Mr. Hamza walking with the victim behind the National Museum of Wales. Concerned by what he perceived as \"sinister\" behavior, Neill discreetly photographed the couple, inadvertently startling Mr. Hamza, who fled the scene. Despite initially being mistaken as the assailant by the confused victim, Neill was subsequently released after DNA evidence implicated Mr. Hamza.\n\nThroughout the trial, the victim recounted consuming wine, cider, and cocktails during her night out and expressed her inability to recall much of her journey home or the attack itself. Nonetheless, she maintained that she would never have consented to sex with a stranger, asserting, \"I have a moral compass.\" This statement underscores her stance on the impossibility of her consent, adding a layer of personal conviction to the prosecution's argument.",

Her fianc\u00e9, Ian Stewart, stands accused of her murder but vehemently denies the charges. The court proceedings at St Albans Crown Court involve testimonies that challenge Stewart\u2019s narrative, including that of Edward Farmer, who initially claimed to have seen Bailey in a car in Broadstairs, Kent, sometime between mid-April and June. However, under scrutiny, Farmer conceded that his sighting might have occurred much earlier, possibly weeks before Bailey was officially missing. Farmer described seeing her alone in a dark-colored SUV resembling a Range Rover near her holiday home on Charlotte Street, which counters the defense's claim that Bailey was abducted by two violent men.\n\nWhen questioned about the timing of his observation, Farmer admitted uncertainty, estimating it happened \"about five, maybe six weeks prior to the police interview on July 13th\", a timeframe that could place the sighting in March, well before Bailey's disappearance was reported by Stewart on April 15th. This admission, fraught with ambiguity, casts doubt on the reliability of his testimony, a point emphasized by the prosecution during cross-examination. Farmer also disclosed that he had \"no reason at all\" to recall the sighting until prompted by a journalist from The Sun in June, suggesting potential external influences on his memory.\n\nThe trial delves into serious allegations against Stewart, who is also accused of drugging Bailey, suffocating her, and disposing of her body in the pit beneath their garage.

Mr. Trump responded with laughter and an ambiguous remark, \"We need this question?\" without clarifying that President Obama is a Christian American. He further commented that \"bad things are happening\" and promised to look into them, failing to directly address the inflammatory rhetoric.\n\nDemocratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton criticized Mr. Trump's response, calling his failure to denounce the \"hateful rhetoric\" both \"disturbing and wrong.\" She took to social media to emphasize her stance, tweeting: \"Donald Trump not denouncing false statements about POTUS & hateful rhetoric about Muslims is disturbing & just plain wrong. Cut it out.\" Similarly, Democratic National Committee Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz condemned Mr. Trump, asserting that his \"racism knows no bounds.\"\n\nIn an attempt to mitigate the situation, Mr. Trump's campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, told the US media that Mr. Trump only heard the part about training camps. He also shifted the focus, claiming, \"The media wants to make this issue about Obama. The bigger issue is that Obama is waging a war against Christians in this country.\"\n\nThis incident drew comparisons to a 2008 campaign moment when Republican nominee John McCain corrected a supporter who falsely claimed then-Senator Obama was \"an Arab.\" President Obama, who has openly discussed his Christian faith, was born in Hawaii to an American mother and a Kenyan father. Mr. Trump had previously challenged President Obama to produce his birth certificate in 2011 to counter rumors about his birthplace, which the president subsequently did.\n\nDespite having no political experience, Mr. Trump leads his Republican rivals in the polls, with more than a year until the election.

His staunch criticism of the government's handling of the Calais migrant crisis is a testament to his compassion and conviction. \"These are human beings, these are people in desperate situations - they need our help and they need our support,\" he emphasized in our conversation, a rallying cry for empathy and action. Mr. Corbyn passionately believes that the UK should play a more active role in the European programme for refugees, including those fleeing the Syrian conflict.\n\nHis stance on immigration starkly contrasts with that of the UK Independence Party, whose leader, Nigel Farage, raised concerns about the unpredictability of population numbers impacting public services at a recent conference in Doncaster. Echoing this sentiment, Damian Green, a Conservative MP and former immigration minister, labeled open-door immigration as irresponsible. Yet, Mr. Corbyn counters with optimism, championing immigration as a boon for the UK. \"Our health service, our education service, and much of our industrial development have thrived thanks to the efforts of those who have settled here, contributed to our economy, and enriched our society,\" he asserted, encouraging an embrace of the diversity that defines modern Britain.\n\nAs he prepares to address the Labour faithful in Brighton, Mr. Corbyn is eager to tackle pressing issues like the housing shortage, infrastructure investment, and his opposition to benefits reform. His message is clear: reaching out beyond the party\u2019s base to reclaim the trust of the South East's electorate is crucial, a challenge he approaches with determination. Despite the daunting path ahead, Mr. Corbyn is optimistic about Labour's prospects, confident that the party is poised to regain ground in the South East. The Labour conference, set for 27 to 30 September in Brighton, promises to be a pivotal moment in this journey, offering a platform to inspire and unite.",
        "In the haunting shadows of Koh Tao's serene beaches, a heart-wrenching tragedy unfolded, forever altering the lives of families oceans apart. It was September 2014, a time meant for adventure and discovery, when the vibrant spirits of Miss Witheridge, a 23-year-old student from Norfolk, and Mr. Miller, a 24-year-old civil engineer from Jersey, were brutally extinguished. Their dreams, once as vast as the ocean that cradled their final moments, were shattered on that fateful stretch of sand.\n\nThe grief-stricken families of these young souls were thrust into a relentless pursuit of justice that traversed borders and cultures. In December 2015, the eyes of the world turned towards the courtrooms of Thailand, where Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Tun, two Burmese bar workers, were found guilty of this heinous crime. A verdict that carried the weight of death sentences, upheld by an appeal court, loomed over them like a dark cloud.\n\nYet, beneath the surface of these proceedings lay a deep well of uncertainty and anguish. The mothers of Lin and Tun, echoing the desperate cries of their sons, sought solace and truth through an appeal in Koh Samui, challenging the integrity of the investigation. \"We don't believe the court can say beyond reasonable doubt that Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo were responsible for the events which took place in September 2014,\" voiced Andy Hall, embodying the families' relentless hope for justice that transcends mere conviction.\n\nThe narrative was further complicated by the haunting specter of alleged police misconduct. The accused, who had retracted their initial confessions, claimed they were coerced under the duress of torture\u2014a testament to the",
        "According to a report by the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP), the total cost of conflict worldwide is equivalent to the combined economies of Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Spain, and the United Kingdom. The report highlights an increasing disparity between the most and least peaceful nations. Iceland ranks as the world's most peaceful country, while Syria is the least. Notably, Libya experienced the most significant decline in peace during 2014. The Middle East and North Africa have now surpassed South Asia as the most violent region globally, a title South Asia held in 2013. In 2014, conflicts resulted in 180,000 deaths, a stark increase from the 49,000 deaths recorded in 2010. The report also documented a 61% rise in terrorism-related fatalities in 2013, claiming nearly 18,000 lives, predominantly in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nigeria, and Syria. Should global violence decrease by 10%, the IEP estimates a potential economic gain of \u00a31.43 trillion. IEP Chief Executive Steve Killelea emphasized the \"inequality with peace\" worldwide, noting that some Western European countries have achieved historically low levels of violence and security expenditure. Conversely, nations such as Iraq, Syria, Nigeria, South Sudan, and the Central African Republic have become increasingly violent in recent years. The IEP estimates that the total cost of conflict accounts for 13.4% of the world's GDP, with significant increases attributed to deaths from internal conflicts, internally displaced persons (IDPs), refugee support, UN peacekeeping efforts, and GDP losses due to conflict. The cost of supporting approximately 50 million refugees and IDPs, the highest number since World War II, has surged by 267% since 2008 to $128 billion. The report further suggests that a 10% reduction in global violence would enhance the world economy by $1.43 trillion, an amount more than six times what is needed to eliminate Greece's debts and triple the combined earnings of approximately 1.1 billion of the world's poorest individuals.",
        "The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has imposed fines on Falcon and Pointer (\u00a3175,000) and Direct Choice Home Improvements Ltd (\u00a350,000) for breaches of regulations concerning automated calls related to Payment Protection Insurance (PPI) and other inappropriate solicitations. Both companies attributed the calls to third-party actions. Anne Jones, the Assistant Commissioner for Wales, commented on these actions, highlighting ongoing investigations pointing to Swansea as a notable hub for cold-calling activities in the UK. The ICO has responded to such practices by taking action against six companies since 2013. Despite Falcon and Pointer's assertion that they ceased making calls in June 2015 and having their licence revoked in January 2016, an investigation revealed they made an additional two million calls subsequently. Direct Choice Home Improvements Ltd faced 168 complaints within a six-month period. Jones emphasized the importance of adherence to regulations, expressing that the ICO's actions aim to curb non-compliance. Sandra Busby, Managing Director of the Welsh Contact Centre Forum, remarked on the market's dual nature, recognizing the legitimacy of businesses contacting existing customers while acknowledging concerns over unethical practices. The ICO's updated Direct Marketing Guidance aims to assist organizations in understanding legal requirements and adopting best practices.",
        "The unfolding drama of the walkout at Ashworth Hospital is a story brimming with tension and heartache. The dismissal of nurses Kevin Gregson and Peter Hilton has ignited a firestorm of emotions, leaving many to ponder the thin, often blurred line between justice and compassion. The two nurses, now caught in the throes of this controversy, were let go despite their efforts to use what they believed to be \"reasonable force\" in a harrowing encounter with a patient. The Prison Officers' Association (POA) has stood firmly by their side, painting a poignant picture of dedicated professionals thrust into a maelstrom of violence and chaos.\n\nThe Mersey Care Trust, however, views the situation through a different lens, maintaining that the weight of evidence left them with no alternative but to dismiss Gregson and Hilton. Their statement reverberates with a sense of duty and responsibility, acknowledging the complexity and vulnerability of their patient population. Yet, one cannot help but feel a sense of frustration and sadness at the perceived lack of balance between protecting staff and caring for patients.\n\nAt the heart of this conflict is the enduring human struggle for empathy and understanding. Steve Gillan, the POA's general secretary, passionately argues that the public will rally behind the nurses, outraged at a system that seemingly fails to shield its protectors. His words echo with a sense of injustice, highlighting the brutal reality faced by those on the frontline of mental health care. The nurses' actions, he insists, were born out of necessity, a desperate bid to restore calm amidst chaos.\n\nAs the situation unfolds, the trust's decision to move forward before an independent tribunal hearing has only deepened the divide. Their disappointment in the union's strike action underscores a broader tension within the healthcare system, where the interests of staff, patients, and the community often collide in complex, emotionally charged ways.\n\nIn",
        "In the gentle embrace of Charles Blackman's canvas, \"Women Lovers\" whispers the story of two serene souls, their forms gracefully reclined beside a silent feline companion. This intimate tableau, painted in oil, stirred the winds of controversy when Mossgreen, an art broker, sought to share its beauty on Facebook. The digital gatekeepers, however, deemed it unfit, labeling it as an advertisement for \"adult products or services.\" Paul Summer, Mossgreen's chief executive, found this ruling utterly absurd. \"This image radiates a pure, unspoken beauty, free from any overt sensuality,\" he lamented to the BBC. \"It's as if we've been transported back to an era of stifling censorship akin to the 1950s.\"\n\nDespite Mossgreen's earnest reposting efforts, Facebook remained steadfast. \"Such ads foster negative sentiment among users, and we maintain a zero-tolerance stance,\" the network asserted. Yet, this is not a solitary skirmish in the realm of art versus censorship. Only a month past, a French educator challenged Facebook in court over a suspended account, the result of sharing a 19th-century Gustave Courbet nude.\n\nAnticipation hangs in the air as \"Women Lovers\" readies for the auction block, expected to fetch over A$45,000. \"Until Facebook's objection, no voice had risen against this piece,\" Mr. Summer remarked. \"I ponder the protectiveness of their stance, as my own teenage daughters would dismiss this controversy with laughter.\"\n\nAt 88, Blackman stands as a venerable beacon, a remnant of a golden era in Australian artistry, among luminaries like Arthur Boyd, Sidney Nolan, and Albert Tucker. Not long ago, his \"The Game of Chess\" commanded A$1.78 million at a Sotheby's auction. \"Charles Blackman is revered, the most esteemed living artist of our nation,\" Mr. Summer declared, his words echoing like",
        "The adaptation of \"The Spy Who Came In From The Cold,\" set during the peak of the Cold War, is currently under development by Simon Beaufoy, the Oscar-winning writer renowned for \"Slumdog Millionaire.\" The narrative centers on Alec Leamas, a British intelligence officer struggling with the disarray of his East Berlin network. John le Carr\u00e9, the author, expressed his enthusiasm for the series, which is slated to air on BBC One. This production marks another collaboration with the US network AMC, following their successful joint venture on \"The Night Manager.\" That series garnered Golden Globe Awards for Tom Hiddleston, Hugh Laurie, and Olivia Colman, and received a nomination for Best Miniseries or Television Film.\n\nSet in 1962, shortly after the construction of the Berlin Wall, the story depicts Leamas's agents as either fugitives or casualties, victims of the East German counter-intelligence officer Hans-Dieter Mundt. Recalled to London, Leamas is presented with an opportunity for retribution. Originally penned in 1963, the novel was adapted into a film starring Richard Burton in 1965. Le Carr\u00e9 expressed his anticipation for the new adaptation, stating: \"I'm very excited by the project, and have great confidence in the team.\" Beaufoy echoed this sentiment, describing the project as an opportunity to work on \"the best Cold War spy story ever written.\" The series will be produced by The Ink Factory, the company behind \"The Night Manager,\" in conjunction with Character 7. Piers Wenger, Controller of BBC Drama, remarked, \"Following the huge global success of 'The Night Manager,' it's a privilege to announce that John le Carr\u00e9 will return to BBC One with one of the best spy thrillers ever written.\"",

This exploration unearthed a fascinating shift in the narrative landscape as modern technology increasingly infiltrates the imaginations of these budding storytellers. Gone are the days when email, mobile, and Facebook reigned supreme; they've been eclipsed by the vibrant universes of Instagram, Snapchat, and the ubiquitous emoji. Television, once a storytelling stalwart, has now taken a backseat to the omnipresent phone. Adding a twist of modern flair, the hashtag symbol # has evolved from a simple social media tool into a storytelling device, peppering sentences with added layers of meaning and commentary. #IblameTwitter #AndInstagram. Vineeta Gupta from the Oxford University Press remarked on the transformative nature of this change in 2015, noting how children have reimagined the hashtag from a mere search tool to an editorial flourish that injects drama and wit into their tales.\n\nIn this digital evolution, words like iPod, mp3, and Blackberry teeter on the brink of obsolescence, overshadowed by the likes of iPhone, chat app WhatsApp, and the messaging site ooVoo. #keepup The stories brim with themes of internet fame, as young authors weave narratives around the exhilarating highs of YouTube hits, shares, and likes. #makesabetterstory While classic characters like Cinderella, Lionel Messi, Snow White, Adolf Hitler, and Wayne Rooney make their appearances, researchers found themselves charmed by the mythological allure of Zeus, the Minotaur, and Hercules. #theyloveZeus World War One serves as a rich backdrop for many tales, though current events like the strife in Ukraine and Syria also emerge, though paling in comparison to the gripping saga of the Ebola outbreak and the quest for a cure.\n\nIn this vibrant tapestry of creativity, new words are born\u2014'wellysaurus,' 'gloomful,' and 'Stegasuarez,' a fantastical fusion of a Stegosaurus and footballer Luis Suarez, capturing imaginations with their playful innovation. #itbites The culmination of this literary journey will unfold live on Friday at St James's Palace, where The Chris Evans Breakfast Show on BBC Radio 2 will announce the winners, with a touch of royal flair provided by the Duchess of Cornwall.",
        "The young Heracles forward, a promising 23-year-old, found himself at the center of swirling rumors as he awaited the finalization of a move to a Championship club. Despite the buzz, manager Russell Slade firmly dismissed the reports, albeit acknowledging a fleeting interest in the player \u201csome time ago.\u201d \"To my knowledge, that's not something we're going to pursue,\" he stated with conviction.\n\nThe Netherlands Under-21 international, Weghorst, had embarked on his football journey with FC Emmen before making his mark at Heracles in 2014. Meanwhile, Heracles Chairman Jam Smit expressed confidence that a transfer fee had been settled with Cardiff for Weghorst, who had also caught the eye of Celtic. \"I think all the forcing and speculation surrounding the player seems to originate from the Netherlands,\" Slade remarked, reflecting on the origins of the rumors.\n\nSlade is contemplating augmenting his squad with up to three new signings during the transfer window to bolster the Bluebirds' quest for a Championship play-off berth, as they trail by four points behind the coveted top six. With the recent departure of last season's top scorer, Kenwyne Jones, to Al Jazira in the United Arab Emirates, the acquisition of a striker becomes paramount. Jones, a Trinidad and Tobago international, took to social media to assert that no fresh contract was offered to him by the club. However, Slade countered this narrative, stating, \"I'm pretty sure there was dialogue going on between Kenwyne's representatives, Kenwyne himself, and [chief executive] Ken Choo and the board of directors.\"\n\nFurthermore, Slade refuted claims by Rotherham Manager Neil Redfearn regarding ongoing discussions about a potential transfer for Alex Revell. Revell, who joined Cardiff from Rotherham in January 2015, has managed to find the net twice in 15 league outings for the Bluebirds. Slade emphasized the necessity of maintaining a balanced roster, asserting, \"We've already lost a target-type center forward. We need to be mindful not to shoot ourselves in the foot and ensure we have sufficient players in every position across the pitch.\"\n\nAs Cardiff prepares to face League One's Shrewsbury Town",

The character grapples with these uncertainties, caught between the optimism of NHS England's vision and the stark realities voiced by pharmacy representatives like Claire Ward. Their internal conflict echoes the broader debate: can innovation truly thrive in an environment facing financial constraints?\n\nAs NHS chief executive Simon Stevens and figures like Dr. Adam Roberts and Sir Bruce Keogh herald this initiative as a necessary leap forward, our character remains at the intersection of hope and doubt.

        "The Sakurajima volcano, majestically perched on Japan's Kyushu island, is increasingly being viewed as a formidable force of nature, casting a looming shadow of potential peril. Researchers at the University of Bristol have sounded the alarm, marking it as a \"growing threat.\" This volcanic giant, situated a mere 49 km (30 miles) from the Sendai nuclear plant, also lies in unsettling proximity to Kagoshima, a bustling city home to 600,000 residents. Sakurajima's last catastrophic eruption in 1914 claimed 58 lives, a somber reminder of its destructive capability. Nestled within the Pacific \"Ring of Fire,\" the Japanese archipelago hosts over 100 volcanoes, with Sakurajima standing out for its frequent displays of power. It routinely showers the landscape with ash and experiences numerous minor eruptions annually, with the most recent occurring in February. Japanese authorities maintain a vigilant watch, classifying it as one of two volcanoes at Level 3 on Japan's five-level volcanic warning scale, cautioning the public to keep their distance.\n\n\"The 1914 eruption unleashed approximately 1.5 cubic kilometers of volcanic material,\" explained Dr. James Hickey, the study's lead author, currently affiliated with the University of Exeter's Camborne School of Mines. \"Our data suggests that it will require about 130 years for the volcano to accumulate enough magma for another eruption of that magnitude, placing us about 25 years away.\" This insight stems from a report published on Tuesday, with contributions from teams at Bristol University and the Sakurajima Volcano Research Centre. Their research uncovered that 14 million cubic meters of magma are amassing annually, enough to fill London's Wembley Stadium 3.5 times over. Alarmingly, this rate of accumulation exceeds the volcano's ability to release it through its routine smaller eruptions, suggesting that a major eruption is likely within the next 30 years. These conclusions were drawn using innovative techniques to study and model the volcano's magma reservoir.\n\nThe scientists' findings carry a poignant hope that they will aid authorities in crafting strategies to mitigate the impact of future major eruptions. \"Being forewarned is being forearmed. Providing critical information to local authorities could potentially save lives if an eruption were imminent,\" emphasized Dr. Hickey. Reflecting this urgency, Dr. Haruhisa Nakamichi, an associate professor at Kyoto University's Disaster Prevention Research Institute, noted that new evacuation plans have already been devised. \"It has been over 100 years since the 1914 eruption, leaving less than 30 years for the anticipated"
