        "Maj Richard Scott, 40, is accused of driving at speeds of up to 95mph (153km/h) in bad weather before the smash on a B-road in Wiltshire. Gareth Hicks, 24, suffered fatal injuries when the van he was asleep in was hit by Mr Scott's Audi A6. Maj Scott denies a charge of causing death by careless driving. Prosecutor Charles Gabb alleged the defendant, from Green Lane in Shepperton, Surrey, had crossed the carriageway of the 60mph-limit B390 in Shrewton near Amesbury. The weather was \"awful\" and there was strong wind and rain, he told jurors. He said Mr Scott's car was described as \"twitching\" and \"may have been aquaplaning\" before striking the first vehicle; a BMW driven by Craig Reed. Mr Scott's Audi then returned to his side of the road but crossed the carriageway again before colliding head-on with a Ford Transit van in which Mr Hicks was a passenger, the court was told. \"There is no doubt that when the Audi smashed into the panel van he was on completely the wrong side of the road,\" Mr Gabb said. Mr Hicks, from Bath in Somerset, was asleep in the van being driven to a construction site in Salisbury by fellow DR Groundworks colleague, Patrick Gilleece. The jury was told the Maj Scott suffered \"substantial injuries\" and could not recall the crash,",
        "The ban was backed by local authorities in Urumqi, state media reported. The move is the latest in a campaign against Islamic clothing and symbols in the mainly Muslim region. China's government has blamed Uighur militants for several recent attacks - but activists say the violence has been fuelled by Chinese repression. The Uighurs traditionally practice a moderate form of Islam. Recently, though, the influence of stricter forms of the faith from the Gulf and Pakistan has led to more women covering their faces. According to the BBC's Asia Pacific editor, Charles Scanlon, the Chinese authorities regard wearing an Islamic face veil as an act of defiance at a time of growing violence in the region. In August this year, the northern city of Karamay banned men with long beards from boarding buses. Some experts believe such restrictions could backfire at a time when many Uighurs believe their culture is under attack. James Leibold, an expert on China's ethnic policy at Melbourne's La Trobe University, told Reuters news agency that the ban on the veils would make them \"more popular as a symbol of resistance and assertion of ethno-national identity\". He is quoted as saying that China's Communist party had made a direct link between certain Islamic dress styles and religious extremism. The law passed in Urumqi is set to come into force after it has been approved by a regional body. China's authorities have attributed a wave of recent violence, some of which has targeted civilians in public places, to Uighur militants inspired or aided by overseas terror groups. It has launched a crackdown in the region, arresting and jailing scores of people. But Uighur activists say that China's strong-arm tactics in Xinjiang - including cultural and religious repression - are fuelling tensions. Why is there tension between China and the Uighurs?",
        "Palmer expects to be fined by the British Horseracing Authority (BHA) for the rule breach during Champions Day. \"It was an oversight,\" Palmer told BBC Sport. \"The wrong kit box was left in the lorry and taken to the stables.\" The Newmarket-based trainer saw Galilieo Gold finish fifth in the Group One Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot. Horses are only allowed to receive hay-feed or water before a race, but other substances such as electrolytes are permitted post-race. Employees of Palmer and fellow trainers, Francois Rohaut and and Jean-Claude Rouget, as well as the trainers themselves, were interviewed by stewards following a report by the Equine Welfare and Integrity Officer. Palmer is yet to hear what punishment the BHA will hand down. \"I imagine there will be a routine fine for a rule that's been broken,\" he told BBC Radio Berkshire. \"There's no suggestion that anyone was trying to seek an advantage or cheat. It's simply what the rule says. The rules are the rules and you need to stick to them.\" BHA media spokesman Robin Mounsey said: \"Of the substances, three are electrolytes which are permitted in the stables but they just failed to clear it beforehand, while the other substance is permitted in training but just not on a race day.\" All the horses involved, Signs Of Blessing, Architecture, Galileo Gold, and Almanzor - winner of the Champion Stakes - were routine tested. Meanwhile, Palmer has confirmed Galileo Gold will race on next season and the four-year-old will stay in training. \"Horses like him are incredibly hard to find,\" he added. \"When you find them, you want to try and keep them.\" Subscribe to the BBC Sport newsletter to get our pick of news, features and video sent to your inbox.",
        "Regina Hungerford, 56, denied striking a 17-year-old as he listened to music in her class at Merthyr Tydfil College. But a disciplinary panel ruled contact with the pupil was probably made and her conduct had been \"unacceptable\". On Thursday, the Education Workforce Council imposed the suspension, saying: \"The public interest is in favour of her being able to teach again.\" Mrs Hungerford admitted shouting and slamming a book on the desk of the \"provocative and disruptive\" teenager as he listened to rap music in her classroom - but always denied hitting his head. She was cleared, on appeal, of a criminal charge for assaulting the pupil during a maths lesson for those with learning difficulties. But in November, a disciplinary panel found, on the balance of probabilities, she had made physical conduct with the pupil on the head or hand. The panel found she had \"acted in an inappropriate way\" and ruled it was professional misconduct. During the hearing, the mother-of-three pleaded to save her \"very rewarding\" career. She told how the allegations had \"ruined her life\", calling it a \"miscarriage of justice\", but said she wanted to continue teaching. On Thursday, Mrs Hungerford was told she would be suspended from the teaching register for four months, but she will be allowed to return after taking a behaviour-management course. Panel chairman Gareth Roberts said it was the appropriate sanction to \"allow her to return to teaching within a short period of time\". He said: \"The public interest is in favour of her being able to teach again.\"",
        "She was speaking at an event on Thursday to remember four men who were shot dead by the SAS in her home village of Clonoe in 1992. DUP leader Arlene Foster said Mrs O'Neill was wrong to attend, but was not surprised. However, Mrs O'Neill has defended her decision to speak at the event. She said:\"There are some who would say we have no right to remember or to honour them, we have absolutely every right. \"Everyone, it doesn't matter who you are, has the right to remember their dead in a respectful and dignified manner.\" The four IRA men were shot dead after attacking Coalisland police station. Soldiers opened fire on them as they dumped a lorry used in the machine-gun attack in February 1992. The Ulster Unionist Party's Mid Ulster candidate, Sandra Overend, has criticised Mrs O'Neill for attending the event. \"It is only to be expected that republicans would wish to remember their dead, but Michelle O'Neill's presence at such an event is hardly sending a signal to the unionist community that she is some kind of new departure for Sinn Fein,\" she said. An Alliance Party spokesperson said: \"While people will naturally want to mark those who died during the Troubles, it is important in doing so, the focus is on healing wounds, reconciliation and not glamorising violence. We need to avoid using the past as a political weapon, instead focusing on healing and reconciliation.\" SDLP justice spokesperson Alex Attwood said: \"The fundamental roadblock to justice, truth and accountability is the fact that some want to address the past on their own terms and not the terms required by victims and survivors. \"That is what is getting in the way and one of the big reasons why legacy is not being dealt with decisively and ethically.",
        "Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) said the force had \"fragile\" staffing levels and needed to \"implement improvement plans rapidly\". Inspectors visited the force after criticising its response to government spending cuts last year. Police and Crime Commissioner Olly Martins said the report was \"out of date\". In the HMIC's Policing in Austerity: Meeting the Challenge report last year, Bedfordshire Police was judged to be \"requiring improvement\". Inspectors, who said the force would be \"monitored closely\", returned in October and found it was not performing well compared to similar forces. It highlighted problems in the force control room, although said these should be improved by a recent increase in staff. The report described staffing levels as \"fragile but improving\" and said although there had been recruitment, it was not clear what investment the force had made in preventive work to reduce demand. \"There is a concern that it may not be tackling longer-term issues,\" the report said. Inspectors said it needed to implement its plans for improving policing in \"an affordable way more quickly\" while ensuring its service \"remains effective\". However, they said the force was \"moving in the right direction and the pace of change is increasing\". Mr Martins said: \"All that publishing out-of-date snapshots of a force, such as today's report does, is potentially undermine police force morale and mislead the public. \"When HMIC have already made their subsequent inspection it frankly seems incompetent, to say the least, to still publish a report that's seven months out of date.\" HMIC said it had made a further assessment in March and would be returning in May and July.",
        "Their first stop on a busy day of public engagements was a tour of the Giant's Causeway in County Antrim. The Unesco World Heritage Site is made up of some 40,000 large black basalt columns which protrude from the sea. It was the Royal couple's first visit to Northern Ireland's best known tourist attraction. The causeway formed when molten rock was forced up through fissures in the earth to form a lava plateau. The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh then travelled to the nearby village of Bushmills to commemorate local soldier Robert Quigg. He won a Victoria Cross for bravery during the Battle of the Somme. Sgt Quigg was given the highest military award for valour after going out into the line of fire to search for his commanding officer. The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh unveiled a statue of the soldier as well as a commemorative stone. His grandnephew, Leonard Quigg, also gave a short address. From there, the Royal couple moved on to a reception at Portrush Golf Club as guests of the mayor for the Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council. Afterwards, they took a journey back in time as they travelled on a steam train from Coleraine, County Londonderry, to the village of Bellarena. Large crowds gathered in Coleraine to greet the couple as they boarded the five-carriage train, built in 1932. The Royal guests were accompanied by local schoolchildren as they travelled to Bellarena, where the Queen officially opened the village's new train station. The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh first made the same journey along the historic Coleraine to Londonderry railway line in 1953 - the year of her coronation. The original station had opened a century earlier in 1853. Earlier this year, two new railway platforms opened in Bellarena, as part of a \u00c2\u00a346m upgrade to the Coleraine to Londonderry railway line. On her arrival in the village, the Queen unveiled a plaque marking the new development. Wellwishers lined the route, waving union flags and cheering. On Monday, the Royal visitor met Northern Ireland's first and deputy first ministers at Hillsborough Castle in County Down. The trip is the third high-profile royal visit to Northern Ireland in weeks and follows on from appearances by the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall and then the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh last visited Northern Ireland in June 2014.",
        "The Institute of Public Policy Research (IPPR) said London's poorest children outperformed those in the north. The report is being launched by the centre-left think tank in Sheffield. The government said extra funds were being given to early years providers to help children from poorer backgrounds and close the attainment gap. The report has also detailed a number of \"tests\" or benchmarks for the government's northern powerhouse scheme. Research by the IPPR showed only 47% of children born in the poorest families in the north of England achieved a good level of early years development compared with 59% in London. Its survey also found five northern city-regions combined had almost as many well-qualified individuals (3.6 million) as London (3.7 million) - but the IPPR forecasts demand for skilled workers in the North is set to increase. The IPPR has proposed 11 benchmarks for Chancellor George Osborne's flagship policy to boost regional economies, including closing the \"stark\" gap in the development of children aged under five. IPPR's director Ed Cox said: \"We will never become a powerhouse economy when our children and young people have such a poor start in life. \"It will take a generation of investment - not only in new railways and motorways, but in the 'human capital' of the north - in education and training, starting with the youngest. \"If the Northern Powerhouse is to be successful, economic powers must be devolved to all corners of the North to allow businesses and policymakers to develop an economy that supports more productive, resilient and sustainable growth: jobs that pay well, prosperity that is shared, and opportunities for all.\" The Department for Education said it was committed to ensuring every child, regardless of background, could fulfil their potential. It said reforms had meant there were 250,000 more pupils in good or outstanding schools in the north since 2010.",
        "North, 24, landed on his head after a high tackle from Adam Thompstone in his side's 19-11 defeat against Leicester Tigers on Saturday, 3 December. \"I read some reports he must finish and stop playing. He doesn't want to be treated like that,\" Mallinder said. \"All George wants to do is get back and play rugby.\" The Wales international previously had a six-month spell out of the game after suffering a series of blows to the head during matches, including a serious concussion when scoring a try against Wasps in March 2015. Media playback is not supported on this device The former Scarlets winger will sit out Northampton's game against Sale Sharks on Boxing Day because of the incident, despite saying he was not knocked out. \"He said he can remember going up in the air, he remembers landing on the floor, he remembers his head striking the floor and he said he wasn't unconscious,\" Mallinder told BBC Look East. \"That's not saying that he was not knocked unconscious briefly. If he thought he had been concussed, then George is sensible enough to put his hand up and say 'I'm concussed and I need some time out of the game'. \"He went to see the specialist on Tuesday, who backed up that he hasn't got any symptoms. But because he may have been knocked unconscious, we must treat it as a concussive episode and therefore we will not play him for a couple of weeks.\" A concussion review group was formed to investigate how North's case was handled and whether the club have a case to answer, but Mallinder is not worried. \"I want it [the report] to be favourable towards the medics and the rugby club, because I know",
        "Seamer Abbott, 29, and top-order batsman Rossouw, 27, confirmed their international retirements in January. Rossouw, in his first season in county cricket, refused to say if his hand had been forced by Cricket South Africa. \"Maybe, maybe not,\" he told BBC Sport. \"I think that story is one I'm going to tell at a different time.\" Kolpak contracts allow sportsmen from countries with associate trade agreements with the European Union to be afforded the same right to free movement as EU citizens. They are not classed as overseas players under the terms of their contracts, but they become ineligible to represent their country at international level. Abbott and Rossouw's decisions came before Britain's exit from the European Union and they are among several South Africans to make the switch ahead of the new domestic season. Among the others, all-rounder Simon Harmer has joined Essex,Stiaan van Zyl and David Wiese have moved to Sussex and fast bowler Hardus Viljoen will line up for Derbyshire. \"Right now, I'm just going to enjoy life here in England,\" Rossouw said, as he prepares to start a three-year contract with Hampshire. \"I'm enthusiastic about the season. I'm 100% clean cut on my decision and I don't think that's going to change any time soon. \"Right now, my home is in England and I want to be here beyond the next three years for Hampshire.\" For Abbott, a four-year deal marks a return to the county he last played for as an overseas signing in 2014. \"I made a lot of friends here during my last spell and it just felt like the right place for me,\" the right-arm pace bowler said. Abbott broke down in tears when he announced his international retirement after helping South Africa to a home series win against Sri Lanka, but said at Hampshire's pre-season media day that he had come to terms with his reasons for doing so long before it was confirmed. \"I've been comfortable for a long time to be honest,\" he added. \"I've always felt like Hampshire was a home for me. It was a pretty easy transition across here.\" Abbott and Rossouw will hope to make immediate impressions for Hampshire when they begin their County Championship Division One campaign against Yorkshire on 7 April.",
        "Stephen Parnaby, Conservative leader of East Riding of Yorkshire Council, said the announcement was \"great news for the town and the wider East Riding\". The authority said it was spending about \u00a3100,000 on hosting the event. The organisers of last year's inaugural race said it brought \u00a350m into the region's economy. The three-day event was launched by tourist body Welcome to Yorkshire after the county hosted the Tour de France Grand Depart in 2014. More than 1.2m people lined the 320-mile (515km) route. Mr Parnaby said last year's event had attracted thousands of spectators to the East Riding. \"The council feels that the investment made by the authority, circa \u00a3100,000, to bring part of the race here is money well spent and will provide opportunities for local traders to capitalise on increased spending and help boost the East Riding economy,\" he said. Others in Beverley have also welcomed the race's arrival. Local amateur cyclist Ed Neilson said he hoped having the start of the race would encourage other cyclists to visit the town. \"It's nice to see Beverley getting some recognition,\" he said. \"I think that a few people felt it missed out a little last year, because it wasn't shown on the telly.\" Garry Payne, who owns a cycling cafe, said it was \"fantastic news\" for fans that they would get a chance to get up close to the riders. He said: \"It's so colourful and the riders will be signing autographs, and they're a lot more accessible than what it was last year when they literally whizzed by in the flash of an eye.\"",
        "The doctors' union had refused to sit down and talk about improving patient care and had spread \"misinformation\", he told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. Mr Hunt wants to change junior doctors' contracts, which he says are \"unfair\". The BMA said its door was open to talks and blamed the strikes on Mr Hunt's \"shambolic mishandling\" of the matter. The dispute, which began in 2014 and centres around pay and weekend working, has led to strikes being held across England. The next is a 24-hour strike planned for Wednesday, when emergency care will only be provided from 08:00 GMT. Asking by Marr about low morale among junior doctors, Mr Hunt said: \"One of the reasons for that anger is that they were told by the BMA that their pay was going to be cut - it isn't. \"They were told that they were going to be asked to work longer hours - they aren't,\" he added. \"We are actually bringing down the hours that they work. And if you are told by your union that the health secretary wants to do these awful things - of course you are going to feel devalued.\" BMA junior doctor committee chairman Dr Johann Malawana said Mr Hunt was threatening to impose a contract that junior doctors had \"roundly rejected\". \"Junior doctors already work around the clock, seven days a week, and they do so under their existing contract,\" he said. \"If the government want more seven-day services then, quite simply, they need more doctors, nurses and diagnostic staff, and the extra investment needed to deliver it.\" He went on to say the health secretary risked \"alienating a generation of junior doctors and undermining the delivery of future patient care\". Shadow health secretary Heidi Alexander said Mr Hunt was \"insulting the intelligence\" of junior doctors. \"This is a group of people who are incredibly intelligent, are able to make their own minds up, have read the proposals for themselves and have followed the negotiations very carefully,\" she told Sky News. The junior doctors row",

As the South Korean company scrambles to contain the crisis, we look back at the developments so far: 2 August: Samsung unveils its latest flagship model Galaxy Note 7 amid great fanfare in New York. The phone is packed with new features like an iris scanner. The initial response is good and expectations high.

        "The removal of the engines, which have lain idle for two years, would leave 142 active vehicles in the capital. Savings from the proposal would be invested in making more staff available to crew Fire Rescue Units. But the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) said it would be \"dangerous and reckless\" to get rid of them permanently. The London Fire Brigade (LFB) has released three plans to make the savings. It insists no stations will close and no firefighters will be forced to leave their jobs. The Brigade said it had continued to meet London-wide attendance time targets while the 13 engines had been out of service. It said that bringing them back would improve response times by about four seconds for the first engine to reach the scene. An alternative proposal has been put forward by London Assembly Member Andrew Dismore, who recommends putting the 13 fire engines back into service but making savings by establishing alternate crewing at stations with some specialist appliances. The proposals will be discussed on 2 December and there will be a full public consultation on how the Brigade will find the savings, LFB said. The FBU said it was \"opposed to the removal of any fire engine from London.\" A spokesman said: \"In wake of the Paris attacks, it would be dangerous and reckless to reduce the number of fire engines and we would urge the London Fire Brigade to think again. \"The ten fire stations that were closed last year increased response times. By removing these fire engines, we fear that response times could increase again.\"",
        "The news agency's account was suspended and it advised all tweets should be ignored until further notice. The false message said: \"Breaking: Two Explosions in the White House and Barack Obama is injured.\" US markets were spooked by the tweet; the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 150 points as it was retweeted. On Tuesday evening, the FBI said it was investigating the incident. White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters soon after the tweet was published that President Obama was fine, and financial markets quickly recovered the lost ground. AP said later: \"The @AP twitter account has been hacked. The tweet about an attack at the White House is false.\" The account was back online on Wednesday. The agency said the attack came after repeated attempts by hackers to steal the passwords of AP journalists, adding that it was working to correct the issue. Spokesman Paul Colford said the wire service had disabled other Twitter accounts following the attack and was working with the microblogging site to investigate the breach. AP reporter Mike Baker tweeted: \"The @AP hack came less than an hour after some of us received an impressively disguised phishing email.\" The phishing email in question appeared to come from the email account of another AP staffer, with a request to click a link to a \"very important\" article on the Washington Post website. The link opened a bogus login page requesting users enter their staff ID and password, reports suggest. A group claiming to support Syrian President Bashar al-Assad took responsibility for the attacks, tweeting: \"Ops! @AP get owned by Syrian Electronic Army! #SEA #Syria #ByeByeObama.\" The Syrian Electronic Army claims to have been behind similar attacks on the twitter feeds of Agence France Presse news agency, Sky News Arabia, al-Jazeera mobile and CBS News. Two of the US broadcaster's accounts were suspended after fake messages appearing on the @60Minutes account criticised US support for \"terrorist\" rebels in Syria. On Tuesday evening, Twitter said it was investigating the incident and reminded users to be \"extra vigilant\" about phishing emails.",
        "John McCormack drove for a further 30 miles in the articulated lorry after hitting the vehicle on the A9. Perth Sheriff Court was told there were three children in the car at the time of the incident. The 46-year-old was ordered to carry out 250 hours of unpaid work and banned from driving for two years. Prosecutor Rebecca Kynaston said motorists heading north near the House of Bruar shopping complex saw McCormack driving straight towards them. She said: \"To their horror they saw the lorry coming south. He was on the wrong side of the road. \"They managed to get off the road onto the verge. \"The lorry missed them, but unfortunately it continued on and a couple with three children in their car weren't so lucky.\" Ms Kynaston said that the lorry hit the offside of the car and scraped along it. She said: \"One might have hoped that would bring this to an end. The impact was forcible and bent the truck onto the wheel. \"Police managed to pull over the lorry further down the A9. This had been going on for quite a few miles.\" McCormack, 46, from Kilmarnock, admitted driving dangerously on the wrong side of the road on 11 April last year. He also admitted failing to stop after an accident, and driving a vehicle which posed a danger due to its condition. Defence solicitor David Holmes said McCormack had decided to stop driving in the wake of the incident. He said: \"He has no recollection of the accident or how it could have taken place. \"He remembers sneezing and that's as",
        "In a statement, it said Foreign Affairs Secretary Perfecto Yasay would raise the issue at a major two-day Asia-Europe summit starting on Friday, attended by China's Premier Li Keqiang. A UN-backed tribunal ruled on Tuesday that there was no legal basis to China's claims in the South China Sea. China has vowed to ignore the ruling. It says the panel has no jurisdiction and its activities in the region will not be affected. The Asia-Europe Meeting Summit (Asem) in Ulaanbaatar in Mongolia on Friday and Saturday will be the first major multilateral diplomatic gathering since the 12 July ruling over the South China Sea. The summit will see 53 leaders from Asia and Europe attending, including from countries such as Vietnam and Malaysia which also claim territory in the region. It will also be the first meeting in which the new Philippine government of President Rodrigo Duterte will be represented on the world stage. The Department of Foreign Affairs said Mr Yasay, representing Mr Duterte, would \"discuss within the context of Asem's agenda the Philippines' peaceful and rules-based approach on the South China Sea and the need for parties to respect the recent decision\". It is the strongest statement yet from the Philippines on the ruling. Mr Duterte has adopted a more conciliatory approach than his predecessor Benigno Aquino, saying the Philippines would be willing to share natural resources with China in contested areas if the tribunal ruled in its favour. It initially welcomed the ruling as a \"milestone decision\", but without outright celebration. China, which claims almost all of the South China Sea, has said the summit is \"not a suitable place to discuss\" the issue. \"It should not be put on the agenda,\" Assistant Foreign Minister Kong Xuanyou told Reuters. Tuesday's ruling came from an arbitration tribunal brought by the Philippines under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which both countries have signed. It said China had violated the Philippines' sovereign rights and caused \"severe harm to the coral reef environment\" by building artificial islands. The ruling is binding but the Permanent Court of Arbitration has no powers of enforcement.",
        "\"It's been a massive showcase for so much that's positive, strong and good about Wales,\" he said. Mr Crabb said the relationship with the Welsh government and First Minister Carwyn Jones worked \"remarkably well\". He said they had been determined that day-to-day politics would not interfere with showing Wales working together. More than 60 world leaders, 4,000 delegates and 1,500 journalists have spent two days at the Celtic Manor Resort for the one of the biggest ever international gatherings ever to be held in the UK. Mr Crabb said: \"We wanted it to be an opportunity to show the world the very best of Wales in terms of hospitality, quality of infrastructure and facilities. I believe this week has shown exactly that. \"We've been clear that this Nato summit needs to have a lasting economic impact for Wales. I believe the global profile of Wales this week will help that. \"And with the investment summit we're organising on the back of the Nato summit, we're determined it will bring more inward investment. \"Bringing world leaders, prime ministers and ambassadors here this week has all been part of that plan.\" The UK Investment Summit, on 20 and 21 November, will also be held at the Celtic Manor. US President Barack Obama voiced his approval for the warm Welsh welcome on Thursday, praising the country for its \"extraordinary beauty, wonderful people, and great hospitality.\" Despite hopes of long-term benefits to Wales, traders in the centre of Cardiff have complained that security barriers and road closures hit their businesses hard by deterring customers in the run-up to the summit and during the event. First Minister Carwyn Jones paid tribute to residents and businesses for their support for the summit and \"tolerance of some inevitable disruption\". \"What a fantastic week this has been for Wales,\" he said. \"President Obama himself gave us the biggest endorsement,",

This will happen via an alternative back - known as a MotoMod - that Amazon will sell for the Moto Z later this year. And at the CES tech show in Las Vegas last month, Chinese tech giant Huawei announced it would include Amazon's rival Alexa assistant on its phones. Google Assistant differs from its competitors slightly in that it is designed to prompt conversations with users and respond to follow-up queries. \"It is a natural step for Google to offer Google Assistant to as many smartphones as possible because AI is at the heart of Google's strategy, said tech analyst Ian Fogg at IHS Technology. \"With the machine learning that underpins Google Assistant AI, the more people that use Assistant, the smarter it will become.\" Initially, Assistant will be available to English-speaking users in the United States.

Voting spilled into a second day in some parts of Nigeria after problems with new electronic card readers. President Jonathan was among those unable to cast his vote using the technology, which was introduced to prevent fraud. His Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), who had opposed the card readers, called it a \"huge national embarrassment\". The Inec chair, Attahiru Jega, stressed that only a fraction of the 150,000 card readers being used nationwide had failed. The vote had been delayed by six weeks because of the insurgency by Boko Haram militants. Unpredictable poll Nigeria decides 2015: Full coverage The Islamists attacked polling stations in north-eastern states, with a curfew declared in Bauchi State after fighting between the security forces and the group. The UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon praised the \"determination and resilience\" of Nigerian voters, despite the reports of attacks by Boko Haram and others. He said in a statement voting had been \"largely peaceful and orderly\". His comments have been echoed by the regional bloc Ecowas, who urged Nigerians to accept the result. But there has been tension in the southern Rivers State, where thousands protested against alleged killings of opposition workers and voting irregularities. Inec said it was \"concerned\" by the complaints, adding that one of their offices was set on fire during the unrest. Results of the voting are expected to pour in through Sunday night but so far there is no official indication of which party is in the lead.

        "Geoffrey Stewart, 74, of Dumfries, was one of three men in their 60s and 70s who went missing in the Southern Uplands on Tuesday. Police said he died late on Wednesday night at Dumfries and Galloway Royal Infirmary. George Crosbie, 73, also from Dumfries, died earlier on Wednesday. A third man, Bobby Thomson, 64, remains in hospital. A statement from Mr Stewart's family said: \"Our family would like to extend our love and thoughts to the families involved at this very sad and tragic time. \"Sincere gratitude and appreciation goes out to all the services involved in the rescue efforts and hospital staff at Dumfries and Galloway Royal Infirmary.\" The men failed to return from a walk in the hills at Durisdeer on Tuesday. Sixteen members of Moffat Mountain Rescue team (MRT) and two search and rescue dogs combed the hills for the men until the early hours of Wednesday. However the search was stood down amid heavy rain, snow, high winds and poor visibility. When it resumed at 08:30 on Wednesday, more than 50 people were involved in the search, including neighbouring mountain rescue teams and a Coastguard helicopter. The men were found that afternoon and taken by helicopter to the hospital in Dumfries. Police said Mr Crosbie died shortly afterwards and his walking partners were treated for hypothermia. Colin Golphin, Moffat MRT leader, said: \"The weather, although OK during the day, deteriorated rapidly overnight. \"The team searched the hills during the night in extremely poor conditions. \"Our condolences are with the family of the walkers who died.\" The experienced walkers were said to be regular visitors to the Lowther Hills and were familiar with the area.",
        "Unemployment fell to 1.69 million between January and March, down 2,000 from the previous quarter. The jobless rate remained at 5.1%, the ONS said. There were 31.58 million people in work, up 44,000 from the previous quarter. That took the employment rate to a record high of 74.2%. But the number of job vacancies dropped by 18,000 to 745,000, the ONS added, marking the first fall for almost a year. David Freeman, a senior statistician at the ONS, said: \"The employment rate has hit another record high, but this time the increase is quite modest. \"With unemployment very little changed, that is further evidence the jobs market could be cooling off.\" Average earnings including bonuses rose 2% from a year earlier, up from 1.9% in the three months to February. The ONS said the timing of bonuses this year had affected the rise in total earnings. Excluding bonuses, earnings rose by 2.1% year-on-year in the three months to March, down from 2.2% in the three months to February. The number of people claiming jobless benefits fell by 2,400 in April to 737,800, although revised data showed the figure rose by 14,700 between February and March, the largest increase since autumn 2011. The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Stephen Crabb, said: \"These are another record-breaking set of figures, with more people in work than ever before and the unemployment rate is the lowest in a decade at 5.1%.\" But economists were less upbeat. David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, said that despite the UK employment rate reaching a record high, \"the cumulative picture - including manufacturing, trade and GDP figures - points to a softening in economic activity\". Paul Hollingsworth, UK economist at Capital Economics, said: \"Although there were some bright spots in today's UK labour market figures, on the whole they offered a further indication that the economic slowdown has sapped the jobs recovery of its recent vigour.\" However, Martin Beck, senior economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said: \"With the unemployment rate back to the pre-crisis average... it would be unrealistic to expect the rapid drops in unemployment seen in 2015 to continue indefinitely.\"",
        "Taibu, 32, played 28 Test matches and 150 one-day internationals for Zimbabwe prior to retiring in 2012. \"When he explained who he was I thought it was a hoax,\" Hightown publicity officer Nick Gordon said. \"The conversation developed, we got references from people in the game in Zimbabwe and we've talked ever since. It's a real coup for us.\" The wicketkeeper-batsman could make his debut for the Second Division side when they play Alder on 24 April. Speaking to BBC Radio Merseyside, Gordon said Taibu approached the club after they had advertised for an overseas player for the summer. \"It's not every day that a club like Hightown St Mary's signs a player like Tatenda,\" Gordon said. \"I had to do a double take, it was so unusual. We put out an advert for young players but he said 'I'm not a young player, I'm a retired Test cricketer.' \"This guy has played at an incredibly high standard of cricket and we are happy to take the risk. Even if he hasn't picked up a bat since 2012, he will be more than sufficient for our needs this summer.\" Signing the former international, who scored 1546 runs in 28 Test matches, also came as a shock to Hightown's players as well as their rivals. \"It was utter disbelief at the beginning,\" Gordon explained. \"The players thought it was a wind-up but, over time, people are excited about him coming over. It's not every day we get this opportunity at club level. \"There's certainly some envious eyes - I've seen some comments on Twitter asking how on earth we pulled it off. But people are looking forward to playing against him. \"These are guys who work nine-to-five, Monday-to-Friday, and they're going to turn up on a Saturday and play against an international Test captain. \"It's great for local cricket as well.\"",
        "The hashtag #penuriecarburantdansunfilm, which translates as \"fuel shortage in a film\", became France's top Twitter trend on Tuesday, with more than 5,000 tweets. A strike over new labour laws is now affecting all of France's eight oil refineries. An estimated 20% of petrol stations have either run dry or are low on supplies. In their posts, French social media users talk about films such as Total Recall, the title of both a 1990 and 2012 science fiction film. Total is also the name of a French multinational oil and gas company. Some users also changed film titles to reflect the shortage: Pulp Fiction was renamed Pump Friction, The Full Monty became The Fuel Monty and Mad Max: Fury Bicycle Lane replaced Mad Max: Fury Road. American actor Vin Diesel's surname and his Hollywood blockbusters attracted particular attention, with people inventing several titles for his Fast and Furious series: Last and Furious, Pas Fast Mais Furious (translation: Not Fast But Furious), Immobile and Furious and Fuel Furious. Others renamed 8 Mile, a semi-biographical drama staring US rapper Eminem, 0 Mile and 8 Miles a Pied (translation: 8 Miles on Foot). American director Stanley Kubrick appeared to inspire people who posted about Fuel Metal Jacket, referring to Kubrick's 1987 film Full Metal Jacket. 2001, l'Odyssee de l'espace is the French title of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. But Espace is also the name of minivan built by French car manufacturer Renault. Pictures of people filling jerrycans at petrol stations led people to incorporate the term into film titles. Tom and Jerrrycan, Jerrycan Beauty and Catch Me If You Jerrycan were the result. Another obvious target was Nicolas Winding Refn's 2011 film Drive which social media users changed to Walk and Drive Pas. Read more about France's controversial new labour laws",
        "Among them was a 17-year-old stopped at Sydney airport a fortnight ago, said Immigration Minister Peter Dutton. Mr Dutton said there was a \"growing threat\" from Australians attempting to join groups like Islamic State (IS). Special anti-terror teams were installed in Australia's eight international airports in August. The teenager, who was on his way to the conflict in the Middle East, was returned to the custody of his parents while investigations continued, said Mr Dutton. The interception came about a week after two Sydney brothers, aged 16 and 17, were stopped at the same airport on suspicion of attempting to join IS. The brothers, who have not been named, were also returned to their parents. According to Australian media reports, the two students have been allowed to resume their studies at a prestigious Sydney high school, despite concerns being raised by some parents of other students at the school. 'Trophy paraded online' Australia's anti-terrorism units have spoken to 85,000 people at airports around the country since August, said Mr Dutton. Australia estimates that about 90 of its citizens have already travelled to Iraq or Syria to fight with IS and 20 have been killed in the conflict. There are unconfirmed reports that Melbourne teenager Jake Bilardi carried out a suicide attack in Syria earlier this month after joining IS. His father, John Bilardi, said in an interview with Australia's 60 Minutes, that his son was a \"loner\" who had a \"death wish\" and had been treated as a \"prize\" by IS. \"He was a trophy that they paraded online. They gloated about how they had recruited this young boy who didn't even have a Muslim background,\" said Mr Bilardi. It is a criminal offence in Australia for citizens to set foot in the IS strongholds of Mosul and Raqqa without a legitimate reason such as a visit to family. Any Australian who travels to the cities could face 10 years in prison.",
        "The amnesty applies to offences committed during the political turmoil after Mr Thaksin was ousted in a coup. The lower house passed the controversial bill in the early hours of Friday. It now goes to the Senate. The opposition Democrat Party has warned that the passage of the bill will trigger street protests. It did not take part in the vote, but the bill passed by 310 votes to 0. The bill's passage through the Senate is less certain, reports the BBC South East Asia correspondent Jonathan Head, as half its members are appointed. But this could happen as early as next week and would almost certainly provoke further protests. Advocates of the bill say it will draw a line under the political turmoil that resulted from the military coup in 2006 that removed Mr Thaksin from power, leaving Thailand bitterly divided. This turmoil included the occupation of Bangkok's main airport in 2008 and then two months of street protests in Bangkok in 2010 that left about 90 people - mostly civilian protesters - dead. But critics say the amnesty would allow human rights abuses to go unpunished. \"The proposed amnesty would allow officials and protest leaders who have blood on their hands to go unpunished,\" said Brad Adams, Asia director of Human Rights Watch, on 21 October. \"By whitewashing past abuses, the government denies justice to victims and tells future abusers they have little to fear.\" The opposition believes the bill is aimed at facilitating Mr Thaksin's return, without having to serve a jail sentence. Thaksin Shinawatra has lived in self-imposed overseas exile since being convicted of corruption in 2008, charges he says are politically motivated. The amnesty - initially limited to ordinary protesters charged over involvement in past street clashes - was suddenly expanded two weeks ago to include anyone investigated by agencies set up after the 2006 coup. It was as a result of one of those investigations that Mr Thaksin was jailed, our correspondent reports. In the wake of the coup Mr Thaksin remained popular with rural voters and both general elections since the polls have seen parties allied to him elected. His sister Yingluck Shinawatra is currently the prime minister. The opposition says it plans to challenge the legislation. \"We will continue our fighting in the street until the bill is aborted. There are other avenues such as by petitioning the Constitutional Court,\" said Democrat Party spokesman Chavanond Intarakomalyasut. On Thursday, as the bill was being debated, thousands of people rallied against it outside a railway station.",
        "Over the next few years Forest Enterprise Scotland will plant them around Loch Trool and the Cree Valley. It is hoped the acorns should help to grow about 600,000 young trees creating a \"large and vibrant habitat\". Environment forester Gareth Ventress said that as soon as they had seen they were in for a \"bumper crop\" of acorns they began planning to collect them. \"We also decided to get help from other staff throughout Scotland and asked them to collect acorns from other native oak woods found on the national forest estate,\" he said. \"The Cree Valley Community Woodland Trust, Borders Forest Trust and Moffat Community Woodlands all assisted in the big collection too in order to further native woodland expansion across their project areas in south Scotland. \"By combining acorns collected from across Galloway Forest Park, we increase the genetic diversity of the trees linking the remnant woodlands. \"This is vital for creating robust and resilient woodlands that can handle pests and diseases well into the future.\" The acorns are collected by laying huge felt nets across the forest floor in order to keep them off the soil and make collection easier. Once the acorns are collected they are sorted then stored. Over the next three to four years the acorn seeds will be germinated and grown so that saplings can then be planted but many of the seeds will be \"graded\" out and deemed infertile during this period. About 600,000 saplings are estimated to be likely to be produced from the acorns. These young trees will help create new oak woods and \"enrich the woodland habitats\" throughout Galloway Forest Park.",
        "Mr Carney said long-term financing of green projects in emerging markets would promote financial stability. Speaking at an event in Berlin, he urged Germany to use its G20 presidency in 2017 to make progress. Mr Carney has previously warned of climate change risks for the finance industry. At the event on Thursday, Mr Carney said that in theory capital should flow from advanced to emerging economies due to high returns. In practice, however, the opposite has happened - and this has driven down bond yields in advanced economies, he said. When money has sporadically flowed to emerging economies it has had a destabilising influence, he said. \"In this context, green finance is a major opportunity. By ensuring that capital flows finance long-term projects in countries where growth is most carbon intensive, financial stability can be promoted,\" he said. Mr Carney said the issuance of green bonds - for example, to help finance water or renewable power projects aimed at reducing carbon emissions - could double in 2016 from last year's $42bn. But they still represent only 1% of holdings by global financial institutions, he said. \"The development of this new global asset class is an opportunity to advance a low carbon future while raising global investment and spurring growth,\" he said. He elaborated on a conundrum - that by the time there is a clear economic incentive to act against climate change, it will be too late to do anything about it. A further potential problem he pointed out was that \"too rapid a movement towards a low-carbon economy could materially damage financial stability.\" As part of the transition towards a low-carbon economy, Mr Carney also urged companies to disclose the financial risks that climate change poses to their business models. Mr Carney has previously warned of the risks of climate change for the finance industry, including the possibility that the majority of fossil fuel reserves might not be recoverable as governments push to limit global warming.",
        "Gene Palmer is the second prison worker detained over the jail break. Joyce Mitchell has already been charged with aiding the escape. The prisoners, Richard Matt and David Sweat, used power tools to flee the Clinton Correctional Facility. A massive manhunt is still under way to find the pair, both convicted killers. Mr Palmer has been held on bail, after appearing before a judge on charges of promoting prison contraband, tampering with physical evidence, and official misconduct. His lawyer, Andrew Brockway, admitted his client delivered the meat but said he did not know it contained the tools, nor that the prisoners were trying to escape. \"He did pass the hamburger meat. He shouldn't have done it. He apologised for it,'' said Mr Brockway, who added his client plans to plead not guilty. Clinton County District Attorney Andrew Wylie said Ms Mitchell placed hacksaw blades and other tools inside the meat, before Mr Palmer took it to Matt and Sweat, who were interred in a section of the jail where prisoners can cook their own meals. Meanwhile, officers are concentrating their search on a 75 sq mi (194 sq km) area of northern New York state. Police found evidence the two men spent time at a hunting cabin near the prison, and it is believed they may be armed, given how heavily the area is stocked with weaponry. \"They are extremely dangerous, they're cunning,\" said New York State Police Major Charles Guess. \"Why wouldn't they try to arm themselves immediately upon escape?''",
        "The party's election manifesto said a funding floor would only be introduced after a referendum was called. The St David's Day Agreement had said the vote would be an \"expectation\", and Labour Welsh ministers oppose a referendum before a funding deal. Labour accused the Tories of trying to hold them \"over a barrel\". The manifesto states the Conservatives would \"introduce a 'funding floor' to protect Welsh relative funding and provide certainty for the Welsh Government to plan for the future, once it has called a referendum on Income Tax powers in the next Parliament\". But a Welsh Conservative spokeswoman told BBC Wales: \"The St David's Day commitment we made to introduce a funding floor for Wales is firm and clear, and work is already underway at the Treasury and the Wales Office to bring this floor forward. \"The funding floor for Wales is not contingent on an income tax referendum. Our UK manifesto makes clear our expectation that the Welsh Assembly will hold a referendum on income tax raising powers early in the next Parliament. \"More detail of our ambitious plan for Wales will be announced in the Conservative Party Welsh Manifesto which will be launched later this week.\" On Friday, Chancellor George Osborne told BBC Wales the funding floor would be between \u00a3113 and \u00a3116 per head for every \u00a3100 spent in England, the range recommended by economist Gerry Holtham. \u200b Labour has said it would also introduce a floor to the Welsh government's funding, but has not committed to a figure. Reacting to the Conservative manifesto, First Minister Carwyn Jones said: \"A vote for the Tories is a vote for a government that would cost Wales up to \u00a3300m a year. \"A fair funding settlement",
        "Hibs were hammered 10-1 on aggregate by Bayern Munich, while City lost 3-1 to Eskilstuna United from Sweden. \"I think it is fantastic for Scottish football that we actually have two teams in the Champions League,\" Signeul told BBC Scotland. \"It just shows that what we have done has actually brought us two spots.\" Signeul pointed out that the Netherlands, who will host the Euro 2017 finals and play Scotland in a 20 October friendly in Livingston, only have one team in Europe's top club competition. \"It is all based on rankings and what Glasgow City and the national team have done previously,\" she pointed out. Hibs were making their debut in the knockout stage. \"It was a great experience for this young Hibs team and they were unlucky in the draw - played probably one of the challengers for the title this year, Bayern Munich, with 26 players in the squad all full-time professionals and all playing for their national squads; Austrians, Swiss, Germans, Dutch,\" Signeul stressed. \"Bayern Munich also had the golden boot player of the tournament in the Olympics, so it was a tough side. \"It is good for all the players at Hibs to see this is the level they want to get to. \"Sometimes you play in internationals and get a little bit cheated - you think you are better than you are because you are playing weaker teams.\" City, Scottish champions for the last nine seasons, reached the Champions League quarter-finals in 2014 but have suffered disappointment two seasons in a row in the round of 32. \"Glasgow City had a chance in their game, but Eskilstuna, the Swedish runners-up, were a little too strong for them,\" said Signeul. \"They had two good games and they were a little unlucky in the way the goals came in both games.\" The future of Signeul's Scottish FA colleague, men's head coach Gordon Strachan, was called into question this week after a draw with Lithuania and a defeat by Slovakia in their 2018 World Cup qualifiers. Signeul stressed that it was unfair to compare the success of her side to Strachan's because \"results usually follow the rankings in women's football\" while the men's game was more competitive and less predictable. She added that she believed Strachan, who has decided to remain in post, continues to have the full backing of his players.",
        "It means instead of people owning cars and bikes, one version of the future is we all hire transport to get around. This week we got another example of that in the capital when oBike launched. It is a company backed by considerable venture capital and it's putting hundreds of hire bikes on London's streets. The company aims to have thousands in the capital by the end of the summer, after already operating huge schemes in South East Asia. The big difference compared to the existing cycle hire scheme is the bikes have no docking stations. A locking rear brake means they can be left anywhere. Users access them via an app and you can find them as they have a GPS locator. There is a one-off \u00c2\u00a349 refundable deposit to be paid and then 50p per half-hour. More companies are set to follow. oBike says it is aiming to work in conjunction with the existing scheme and it has a social agenda to help clean up London's air and reduce emissions. It also wants to work with Transport for London (TfL) and local councils but unfortunately that hasn't happened. Some councils are furious they haven't been consulted and bikes have been \"dumped\" in their areas with no warning. Hackney Council, while backing cycle hire generally, says it has concerns the oBike can be left anywhere, obstructing pavements and roads. The east London local authority added it has had no dialogue with the company at all. In Hammersmith & Fulham, the west London council raised concerns with oBike when about 400 of its yellow bikes appeared in the borough unannounced. \"We're very much in favour of cycling,\" said Cllr Stephen Cowan, leader of Hammersmith & Fulham Council. \"But we expect companies to properly consult with us first. This launch could have been much better thought out.\" He said oBike has agreed to remove the bikes they have deposited in the borough. As we have seen before in London, we are getting a clash between the authorities and new technology companies. City Hall has been rather guarded in its welcome. London's Walking and Cycling Commissioner, Will Norman, said: \"We need dock-less bike operators to work with TfL and borough councils to ensure these bikes work for all Londoners and don't impact negatively on other cyclists, road users and pedestrians. \"These schemes have real potential to make cycling more accessible for many more Londoners but it is vital that they are introduced in a way that suits our capital.\"",
        "Gabon was selected as host on Wednesday by the Confederation of African Football's Executive Committee, beating rival candidates Ghana and Algeria. \"We will prepare ourselves to win the Nations Cup in 2017,\" said Gabon football official Jean-Felix Mba Nze. \"We have decided to play and win the cup.\" Gabon first entered the Nations Cup in 1970 but failed to qualify for the finals until 1994. Their best results came when reaching the quarter-finals in 1996 and 2012, a tournament they co-hosted with Equatorial Guinea. During this year's Nations Cup, which also took place in Equatorial Guinea, the Panthers crashed out early after winning one and losing two of their group games. The 2017 Nations Cup will be the first time Gabon has staged the finals by itself. \"Our main challenge is to organise a better competition than we did in 2012,\" Mba Nze, the secretary general of the Gabonese federation, told BBC Sport. \"I think we won the bid because we made a good presentation and we have made efforts to improve all the stadiums, hospitals and media facilities. \"We are more developed than we were for the last Nations Cup.\" Gabon will use two stadiums from the 2012 finals - in Libreville (capacity: 45,000) and Franceville (25,000) - while adding another two. The new venues of Port Gentil and Oyem, both of which are scheduled to be 20,000-seater stadiums, are set to be ready in August 2016, five months before the competition begins. Gabon's victory was greeted with anger by both the countries it beat. The Algerian press decried the decision, with Algeria Soir calling it a 'sporting and political defeat for Algeria' while El Watan lamented that the country's presentation was 'not sufficiently supported at political levels.' Meanwhile, the Ghanaian bid told the BBC it was 'intrigued' by the decision and asked for greater transparency in the results process, asking why the Confederation of African Football (Caf) had not made the results public. In response, Caf stated that the results of voting were not released when the host countries for the 2019, 2021 and 2023 Nations Cups were announced last September.",
        "They spend an average of \u00c2\u00a3581 a year on music festivals, often opting for VIP passes or upgraded camping options. Predominantly male, the \"superfans\" are also more likely than most consumers to buy music on CD or as downloads. The results came from a survey of 504 UK residents, who had attended at least one festival in the last year. According to ticketing website Eventbrite, which commissioned the survey, these \"superfans\" help to \"drive the music festivals market\", often recommending music and events to their friends. They account for 28% of the festival-going audience, and more than half of them (54%) say they would be willing to attend an event alone. On average, they spend \u00c2\u00a345 more per event than a casual fan, but their loyalty is not guaranteed: 46% say that festivals are becoming \"too corporate\". There are more than 100 music festivals held in the UK every year, from the likes of Glastonbury and T In The Park, to smaller events such as the Cambridge Jazz Festival and Jamie Oliver's Big Feastival. In total, 3.7 million people attend festivals every year, according to Music UK, accounting for more than 39,000 full-time jobs. However, small profit margins and a crowded market have seen some events struggle. In the wet summer of 2012, 57 festivals were forced to cancel - with the likes of Oxegen and The Big Chill shutting their doors. Although the rate of closures has slowed since then, several events - including the Temples festival in Bristol, Down To The Woods in Sedgefield and Field Day in Tunbridge Wells were called off this year; while Sonisphere failed to return from a planned hiatus in 2015. The latest research offers some reassurance to organisers though, with 88% of respondents saying they planned to attend a festival again next year - with more than half of them saying they would go to more. \"It has been a challenging year for some festivals, with inclement weather conditions, general economic uncertainty following Brexit, rising expenditure and heightened security concerns,\" said Paul Reed, who runs the Association of Independent Festivals. \"This research illustrates that the sector remains buoyant, that festival promoters are resilient and will continue to craft unforgettable experiences for audiences, who are keen to return year on year to their favourite events.\" Follow us on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, on Instagram at bbcnewsents, or email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.",
        "The were 37 crimes recorded in Cromer over the weekend - including the rape of a teenager - with residents linking them to a group of travellers. Suffolk Constabulary said it warned Norfolk Police about the group ahead of its arrival on Friday. Norfolk confirmed it was made aware and said it was reviewing its response. Suffolk officers said they told their Norfolk colleagues about the group after it was issued with a local authority notice to leave Lowestoft on Friday afternoon. The notice had been served after a number of incidents of disturbance in the town. Norfolk confirmed it had been told but said there was \"no intelligence to suggest where the group was heading\". On Friday, a woman in her late teens was raped at a bus stop in Cadogan Road, near the seafront. Norfolk Police said there was evidence to suggest it could have been linked to the disorder in the town. One man was arrested and released under investigation in connection with the rape. No other arrests have been made. On Saturday night, a BBC reporter was told by a taxi driver that \"travellers are rampaging the town\", and staff at The Wellington pub said they closed after a group of 30 travellers became \"rowdy\". Lee Sale, who runs an ice cream shop in the town, said travellers had frightened families with \"intimidating behaviour\". Ayrun Nessa, wife of the owner of the Masala Twist restaurant, said she had been confronted at the door by six women shouting abuse.

        "The A320 pilot reported seeing a white quadcopter drone \"flash past\" the aircraft while travelling south of Brookmans Park last August. No avoiding action was possible due to the lack of available time, a UK Airprox Board report said. It concluded a \"collision had only been narrowly avoided and chance had played a major part\". Air traffic control said the A320 pilot reported that \"something had just gone over the top of him\" at about 18:45 BST on 15 August 2016 while flying north of Potters Bar. The controller said another aircraft had just crossed above but the pilot said the object was red and white in colour, had red and blue stripes on two of the rotor arms and was under a metre in size. All drone operators are required to observe Air Navigation Order (ANO) 2016 articles which require a person in charge of a small unmanned aircraft to only fly the aircraft if reasonably satisfied the flight can safely be made ,and not to recklessly or negligently cause or permit an aircraft to endanger any person or property. They must also maintain \"direct, unaided visual contact\" with the aircraft that's sufficient to monitor its flight path in relation to other aircraft. Airprox board members agreed the drone had been operated at an altitude that was beyond direct unaided line-of-sight, which was not permitted under current regulations without explicit Civil Aviation Authority permission, and that it had therefore been flown into conflict with the A320. The drone operator could not be traced.",
        "A survey of employees and managers found that a quarter of new fathers took no paternity leave at all. Fewer than one in 10 took more than their two weeks statutory leave. The research by the Institute of Leadership & Management (ILM) blamed \"ingrained\" attitudes among employers, and concerns among new fathers that they could not afford to take leave. Last year the government announced plans to allow parents to share their maternity and paternity leave - changes are scheduled to come in April 2015. But the ILM said its research suggested the changes would have little impact if attitudes of employers were not addressed as well. \"The introduction of shared parental leave is a crucial step towards enabling more women to progress into senior roles,\" said Charles Elvin, ILM chief executive. \"Yet our research revealed cultural barriers are impeding the uptake of both two weeks statutory paternity leave and additional paternity leave.\" He said there remained a \"cultural expectation\" within organisations that women rather than men will be the ones taking extended periods away from the workplace. The report also said low levels of paternity pay discouraged new fathers, with just 9% surveyed receiving more than two weeks on full pay. Responding to the report, Frances O'Grady, secretary general of the TUC, the trade union body, said pay was the major concern. \"Many dads simply can't afford to take time off, particularly as employers rarely top up their statutory pay.\" Currently, employed fathers are entitled to either one or two weeks' paid paternity leave, though additional leave is also given if the mother returns to work and is not claiming statutory maternity pay. Government plans involve extending this flexibility, allowing parents of newborns to exchange and share their leave. \"We want the introduction of shared parental leave to drive a real cultural shift and help working dads play a greater role in their child's early months,\" a government spokesperson said.",
        "As with last year's parade, only the Orangemen and their 13 notified bands can march past St Patrick's Church on Donegall Street in north Belfast. They must do so to the sound of a single drum beat. This year all music must stop 43 metres away from the church so there is no music within earshot of it. A planned residents' protest has also been restricted to a maximum of 50 people at two locations. The Orange Order has said it is appalled by the determination. \"The commission is now simply a mouthpiece for republican propaganda, allowing them to dictate the terms of when, how and where loyal order parades are held,\" it said. \"The invented new criteria of banning music within 'earshot' of a place of worship not in use, is as mischievous as it is absurd, and clearly put in place to further censor Protestant heritage on the supposed shared streets of Northern Ireland's capital city.\" North Belfast MP Nigel Dodds, of the DUP, said: \"The latest determination by the Parades Commission on Donegall Street demonstrates that this is a bureaucratic monstrosity that has lost the run of itself, simply dances to the tune of republican residents, or a dangerous combination of both. \"It is clear from the document that the Parades Commission gave serious consideration to banning music being played outside Clifton Street Orange hall. I wish that statement was a joke but it is not.\" However, SDLP assembly member Alban Maginness welcomed the determination. \"This determination by the Parades Commission is sensible and I would hope that it sets the tone for this year's marching season,\" he said. \"At every stage of this dispute all that the parishioners of St Patrick's and the residents of Carrick Hill have asked for is to be treated with respect.\"",

He is a free agent again after helping Kolkata finish fourth in the Indian league before winning the title with a play-off victory over his former club, Karela. \"We have spoken to him and offered him a deal and we're waiting to hear back,\" said McFadden, who thinks Motherwell have a tradition of welcoming back former players. \"Pearo would be a great addition on and off the park here. \"We would love to him back, so hopefully he makes the right decision and comes back. \"I know he has one or two things to think about before he makes that decision, but he knows he will be welcomed back with open arms here by everyone.\" Motherwell have signed winger Elliot Frear from Forest Green as well as adding Reading defender Zak Jules and Everton goalkeeper Russell Griffiths on loan in recent days. However, they are still looking to add to their squad before the transfer window closes. \"There could be, we are still working away on that,\" added McFadden. \"But we don't have answers back from the people we are speaking to, so we will see how it goes.\"",
        "Kevin Mcleod's body was found in Wick harbour in February 1997. The 24-year-old's death was treated as accidental, but his family believe that injuries on his body showed that he was murdered. An assessment was done of \"all information known\" regarding the death after contact between his family and chief constable Phil Gormley. Police said the review had included tracing and speaking to people who were in Wick the night Mr Mcleod died, but who had not previously come forward. Mr Mcleod's mother, June, told BBC Scotland last month that if the assessment \"turned up nothing new\" she and her family would continue to fight for a fresh investigation. A separate assessment has been ordered by the chief constable into the handling by the police of the Mcleod family's complaints since 1997 of how the death was investigated. Det Ch Supt Gareth Blair, head of major crime at Police Scotland, said the assessment was carried out \"in recognition of the continued impact\" of Mr Mcleod's death on his parents and \"their desire for a conclusive outcome\". He said: \"Our sympathies remain with them. \"It is important to stress, this was not a full reinvestigation of the death itself, but a careful and considered analysis of a significant volume of information which has been recorded relating to the circumstances since 1997. \"Specialist officers from Police Scotland's major crime command undertook this work, which included tracing and speaking to individuals who were in Wick that night and saw Kevin but who had not previously come forward.\" Det Ch Supt Blair said he told Mr Mcleod's parents on Tuesday of the conclusion of the assessment. He said: \"I informed Kevin's parents that having carried out this assessment there is no evidence of criminality and his death remains unexplained, leading me to determine that there is no basis on which to launch a full reinvestigation. \"Police Scotland appeals for any witnesses who have information about Kevin's death to come forward and we will fully consider any new and additional information. \"The chief constable has asked the head of professional standards to carry out a separate assessment to ensure that all matters/complaints raised by the family over the years have been appropriately considered and addressed.\"",
        "Matthew Eteson is on trial at Preston Crown Court for the manslaughter by gross negligence of Kelly Webster, 36, and Lauren Thornton. The pair died in their sleep aboard a boat on Windermere in April 2013. Mr Eteson, 42, from Hale in Greater Manchester, denies the charge. The family had gone to the Lake District for the Easter bank holiday weekend to celebrate a friend's birthday. But on the afternoon of 1 April, Mr Eteson removed the generator from the deck and used it to power a 1kW fan heater to heat the sleeping quarter, prosecutor Mr Graham Reeds QC said. The court was told that there had been no warning to the build-up of the toxic gas because the carbon monoxide sensors had previously been disabled. Mr Reeds said the mother and daughter, both from Leyland in Lancashire, were found dead in their sleeping positions aboard the the second-hand Bayliner 285 motor cruiser Arniston, with fatal levels of carbon monoxide in their bodies. Mr Eteson, who had been sleeping in a separate compartment further away from the generator also succumbed to the effects of carbon monoxide poisoning but did awake to find the bodies. The court also heard Mr Eteson, a qualified gas fitter, had made some amendments to the generator and its exhaust, which experts subsequently deemed to be \"dangerous\". Ms Webster's mother, Nia Webster, had previously asked Mr Eteson about carbon monoxide sensors. He told her they were not working and his partner would unplug a portable detector whenever she was cooking. The trial continues.",
        "NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) said blood group O negative was vital, as it could be used for patients with other blood groups in an emergency. It said O negative blood made up 12% of transfers, although only 7% of people in the UK had that blood type. Meanwhile, B negative blood is needed for ethnic groups. The NHSBT said ethnic minority groups, who were more likely to have B negative blood, were more prone to sickle cell anaemia, where misshapen blood cells could block blood vessels, causing an early death. It also said such groups were more at risk of developing thalassemia, a group of inherited blood disorders that hindered the blood's ability to carry oxygen. Only 2% of Britain's population were B negative, but hospitals had used 6% more of this blood type in the past last four weeks than the same period last year, said the NHSBT. B negative blood was useful as it could be used for both B negative and B positive patients, the organisation said. Donna Batty, donor relations manager at the NHSBT, asked donors to come forward in the \"next few days\". She said stocks of \"these vulnerable groups\" were \"lower than we would like\". Ms Batty added: \"We are also asking donors of those blood groups who have an appointment coming up to keep it. \"We hope our fantastic donors respond to this appeal and that they bear with us if there are slightly longer waits than normal on session as a result.\" In total, 4% of the UK's population currently donate blood. Jon Latham is assistant director of marketing of NHSBT said that ideally they wanted \"first-time donors\" to come forward. He said: \"The bigger the database we have for people willing to donate, the easier it us for us to call upon them at times",
        "The Employment and Learning minister, Dr Stephen Farry, has decided to remove a special premium payment of \u00c2\u00a31.1m which it has been getting to compensate for its small scale and specialist status. It has fewer than 1,000 students and an income of \u00c2\u00a34.7m a year. Protesters have said that the removal of the small institution premium, coupled with a general cutback in Department of Employment and Learning (DEL) funding, would mean the college loses 31% of its budget. However, an extra \u00c2\u00a332m for the DEL, revealed in this week's overall budget improves the situation somewhat. The college says the addition of extra money means it would be asked to manage on a budget reduced by 26.5%. That's a slightly better prediction but the principal, Prof Peter Finn, says that is still far too challenging. He accuses Stephen Farry of a blatantly opportunistic decision to force the college to agree to one of the solutions he proposes for the future streamlining of teacher training in Northern Ireland. None of the four options includes St Mary's keeping its current autonomy. It says it is determined to retain its character and Catholic ethos, however, Prof Finn says he is keen for what he called \"very deep sharing\" between the various teacher training institutions. That could involve students from each being taught in other university colleges from time to time. Prof Finn strongly objects to the notion that the small scale and specialist premia only exist in Northern Ireland and therefore should be removed. He agrees the payments were removed from similar institutions in England but says those bodies, in return, were allowed to charge much higher tuition fees and were not restricted in how many students they could accept. St Mary's was not permitted that freedom. Stranmillis University College, which has mainly trained teachers for schools other than Catholic, has similar problems but has been in negotiations to merge completely with Queen's University. That process began in 2008 but has met some opposition and",
        "The investment is backed by nearly \u00a315m from the Welsh government with production due to start in late 2018. Economy Minister Edwina Hart said the deal would \"safeguard more than 750 skilled Welsh jobs for many years\". \"In a climate of stiff global competitiveness, we have been actively seeking to win a share of this investment for Wales,\" she said. \"Ford's decision to manufacture its new innovative engine here in Wales is a tribute to the reputation of the local management team and the quality and loyalty of the Welsh workforce,\" she added. The Ford Bridgend plant opened in 1980 and has fought fierce competition to win successive investments in the past worth more than \u00a32.8bn. The company has said its presence supports around 10,000 jobs in south Wales, with 1,860 employed at the plant itself. Ford said technicians based in Essex and Germany had worked together on the design and development of a new fuel-efficient range of engines. A letter from Ford to workers seen by the BBC in June said that to win the investment there would need to be a change to working conditions at Bridgend to make the plant more competitive. Welsh Conservative shadow economy minister William Graham said Friday's announcement was a sign of \"confidence in the UK government's efforts to rebuild the economy\". This is good news for workers at Bridgend as the new production will begin in 2018, just as the manufacturing of Jaguar Land Rover engines at the site will be coming to an end. It secured hundreds of jobs that may otherwise have been in jeopardy. Two hundred fixed contract workers were let go at Ford Bridgend this year when it stopped manufacturing engines for Volvo. There are concerns, though, that the new investment will mean that Bridgend can only manufacture a third of the number of engines it does at the moment. Some question why the Welsh government should be contributing \u00a315m to the investment of a multinational company in a plant it owns. Bridgend was in competition with three other European Ford plants for this work, all with governments offering financial support as standard. The automotive industry is so competitive internationally that without government backing, companies are likely to go elsewhere.",
        "S4C gets most of its income from the licence fee and UK ministers have announced a major review of the BBC. Monmouth MP David Davies told BBC Wales S4C was a \"special case as it promotes the Welsh language\". Ministers have said S4C should aim for similar cost savings as the BBC. On Thursday, Labour warned that cuts to the BBC's budget threatened S4C, but Culture Secretary John Whittingdale told MPs there was a commitment to the channel \"within the next couple of years\", and he hoped to have discussions with its management in the near future. Mr Davies told BBC Radio Cymru's Rhaglen Dylan Jones, on Friday: \"The government realise the importance of S4C and that it's more than a station, it's important to the future of the Welsh language.\" Mr Davies also hinted that the Welsh Affairs Committee, which he chairs, could consider conducting an inquiry into broadcasting, including S4C. \"These are personal views but I believe S4C to be a special case as it promotes the Welsh language and I believe it to be more important that S4C caries on more than any other BBC channel,\" he added. S4C has said it has experienced \"substantial cuts\" since 2010 and would emphasise the \"uniqueness\" of its service, and its \"value and importance, both culturally and economically\", in talks with ministers. A green paper on the future of the BBC released on Thursday noted that \"audience reach has been falling across some indigenous language services over the last few years, particularly in Wales\". It added the higher hourly cost of Welsh-language radio programming compared to English-language output \"raises concerns about value for money\".",
        "The latest Markit Report on Jobs for Scotland found sharp rises in permanent and temporary job placements in April. Growth in temporary staff demand was also at its highest in nearly a decade. However, recruiters said success was threatened by declining candidate availability as employers struggled to bring in the skills they need. The Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) said whichever party formed a government after the general election on 8 June must safeguard access to workers the country needs from abroad, as well as invest in UK jobseekers. The jobs report found growth in permanent appointments continued for the third month running in April, with the fastest rate of expansion for 21 months. This contrasted with a slowdown recorded across the UK as a whole. There was also a sharp increase in temporary placements - the steepest since August 2014. However, the availability of workers fell further in April, with the sharpest drop in the availability of permanent staff in nine months. Meanwhile, availability of Scottish temporary candidates declined at the quickest pace in nearly two years. The IT and computing, nursing/medical/care and hotel and catering sectors saw the highest growth in demand for permanent staff, while nursing/medical/care, IT and computing and engineering and construction led the way for temporary staff. The report also found that average salaries for permanent starters in Scotland rose sharply in April, while the rate at which temporary pay increased in Scotland was the fastest recorded for a year. REC chief executive Kevin Green said: \"The resurgence of the Scottish jobs market continues for the third month running. \"Demand for temporary staff is at the highest level recorded in almost 10 years as employers seek to manage Brexit uncertainty and meet consumer demand. \"News that starting salaries for permanent roles are increasing will also be welcome - there's a lot to feel good about north of the border.\" He added: \"Declining candidate availability is a threat to this success, because employers are struggling to bring in the skills they need. \"If British business is to thrive, then whichever party forms a government after 8 June needs to address the ever-shrinking pool of suitable candidates by investing in skills and career advice for UK jobseekers as well as safeguarding access to the workers we need from abroad. \"It is vital that the future immigration system is agile enough to reflect and adapt to evolving labour market needs.\"",

Although the UN deadline for the total destruction of Syria's chemical weapons is 30 June, Damascus had vowed to complete the removal of its stockpile by 27 April, after missing several deadlines. \"The biggest bulk of the chemical weapons material is removed but not yet destroyed and that counts towards the 30 June deadline. That's why it's so important to get the remainder of the chemical weapons material that is still in one site,\" Ms Kaag, the head of the OPCW-UN Joint Mission, told the BBC. She also said the UN was concerned by recent reports that Syrian forces had used chlorine gas as a weapon. Chlorine was not a substance included in the deal, which is widely seen as having averted US military action against the Syrian government. Damascus has denied using chlorine gas as a weapon. Most of Syria's chemical weapons substances exist as separate materials that only create the highly toxic warfare agents when mixed together, according to the OPCW. Ms Kaag said the facilities need to produce, prepare and launch a chemical weapons attack had been destroyed. \"What remains are the elements of a chemical weapon, but the chemical weapons programme of Syria, as per the current declaration to the OPCW under the Chemical Weapons Convention is no longer in existence,\" she said.",

Instead, he joined up as a private. He was called in to encourage people to sign up and on one occasion addressed a large crowd at a Northampton Saints game. He was credited with helping persuade more than 200 men to join. The international match in 1915 is said to have inspired hundreds of men to sign up to his own corps, the Sportman's Battalion, which formed a significant part of the 7th Battalion of the Northamptonshire Regiment.

The High Court in Glasgow heard he attacked her after she allegedly made a jibe about his children. Kelly, who was caught after confessing to a GP, was originally charged with murder but pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of culpable homicide. The court heard how Kelly had previously been a support worker for Ms Beattie, who suffered from a number of medical conditions including seizures. The divorced mother and Kelly later became friends and often socialised together. The social care graduate attacked her at her home, however, after she allegedly made \"derogatory\" remarks about his children. Kelly grabbed Ms Beattie and strangled her before leaving the flat. He later returned and on finding her dead sat with her body before moving it to her bed before fleeing.

The victim's body was found by her daughter, who had failed to establish contact, on 25 May.

Kelly told a doctor that \"something bad has happened\" adding: \"I think I killed her.\" He went on: \"I remember fighting and grabbing her around the neck. I blacked out and don't remember anything until I suddenly became aware she was dead. \"I carried her body to the bed and left the house. I've not been back since.\" Kelly also said: \"We're just pals - I had been her support worker.\" Police were called and Kelly told officers the last few days had been \"torture\". The court heard Ms Beattie's injuries involved the use of \"significant force\". Judge Lord Bannatyne said the jail-term would have been seven years, but for Kelly's guilty plea.

EU observers have also criticised the poll, saying the governing party had created an \"intimidating atmosphere\" and that the opposition alleged vote rigging. While praising the \"remarkable determination\" of Ugandans to vote, EU Chief Observer Eduard Kukan said the governing National Resistance Movement's \"domination of the political landscape distorted the fairness of the campaign\". The election has been marred by sporadic violence and opposition allegations of electoral fraud, with social media sites and messaging apps blocked. Mr Besigye was put under house arrest on Friday on the suspicion he would announce the results himself, breaking electoral laws, police said. It is the fourth time Mr Besigye, candidate for the opposition Forum for Democratic Change, has taken on President Museveni. The two men were once allies, with Mr Besigye serving as Mr Museveni as his personal doctor when they were guerrilla fighters. Mr Museveni seized power in 1986 and is credited with restoring stability to Uganda. However, critics say he has become increasingly authoritarian.

The centre-back revealed his delight in joining the Swans after getting advice from Michu. \"It has always been my dream to play in the Premier League - it is the best in the world - and I'm grateful to Swansea for giving me this opportunity,\" he said. \"I asked Michu and Jordi Amat about the club. I obviously trained with Michu at Napoli and while I was on loan at Getafe [in 2013] I played with Alvaro Vazquez. He is very good friends with Jordi, so I've spoken to them too. \"Michu told me it is a family club and the city is very relaxed. He said I was joining a very good club. All I've heard are good things about Swansea.\" The Swans play their first home Premier League match against Burnley on Saturday, 23 August following their 2-1 win away at Manchester United in their opener. Fernandez has only recently returned to training following his World Cup exploits so it is not known whether he will be ready for the match. Monk said the defender, who made 13 appearances on loan at Spanish club Getafe last season, is a good acquisition for the club. \"He brings that pedigree where he's been playing for Napoli at the top level and for Argentina at the World Cup. \"The age that he's at is very good for us and the type of player that",

Her mother Karen said she was \"disgusted\" the footage had only just been found after years spent investigating the unsolved murder case. Lancashire Police said it \"understood\" Ms Downes' views. Nobody has been convicted over Charlene's death. The footage has been released on the anniversary of Charlene's 2003 disappearance - as part of the forces \"longest\" murder investigation. Ms Downes said: \"What I can't fathom is why this [the footage] was never found in the previous investigation. This is the bit I'm absolutely disgusted with. \"At the same time I'm happy with the footage and now hopefully they [the detectives] can move forward and we can get some answers. \"I want closure now... We can't move on with our lives and it's just terrible.\" Det Ch Insp Richard McCutcheon said: \"I can understand [the family's] views. We have just found the images and that's why we are publishing them now.\" Charlene is shown with her sister Rebecca in Bank Hey Street at about 15:25 GMT on 1 November, 2003, walking towards the Coral Island amusement arcade. She went home but returned to Blackpool town centre later that evening. That was the last time Charlene was seen. Police said the clothes she is wearing in the footage are the same as when she vanished. Det Supt Andy Webster said officers are looking at links between Charlene's disappearance and the \"wider issue of child sexual exploitation\" in Blackpool. He said: \"We have identified a number of people who could potentially be victims and offenders and we will be seeking to make arrests and prosecute abusers in the near future.\" A judge cleared a man of Charlene's murder in 2008 after \"grave doubts\" were raised about evidence during his second trial. The jury in his first trial failed to reach a verdict. A year later the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said police evidence-gathering errors contributed to the retrial's collapse. The IPCC found strategic and tactical failure in the management of the material and several officers were disciplined with one forced to resign in 2011. But this resignation order was overturned by a 2012 Police Arbitration Tribunal.",

She told told a jury at Oxford Crown Court she did it so that she would not be discharged from hospital. Ms Knight also denies causing grievous bodily harm with intent. She told the court she wanted her mother to remain cared for and not be sent home. She said: \"I felt terrible because I knew I was going to make mum unwell. \"It was a stupid, stupid, thing to do. If I could go back and change it, I would.\" She admitted she told a series of lies to police in January when she was questioned. The court heard she had a forged a prescription for insulin, which she had collected at a Sainsbury's store in Banbury. When asked by defence barrister Simon Mayo QC why she had insisted to officers she had not injected her mother, she said: \"I realised it was serious. I was ashamed of what I had done.\" Prosecutor John Price QC claimed she had intended to administer a lethal dose to Ms Robson before leaving the Horton. He asked: \"Why did you inject your mother with a substance which for all you knew could kill her within five minutes and do nothing for an hour and twenty minutes?\" She replied: \"I never intended my mother to die.\" Ms Knight also told the court she had attempted suicide in 2006 by injecting herself with insulin. Ms Robson died in September but the jury was told earlier in the trial that her death was not relevant to the case and had no bearing on the issues they had to consider. The trial continues.",
        "The Korea Space Launch Vehicle-1 (KSLV-1) blasted off from the Naro Space Center at 16:00 (07:00 GMT). Science Minister Lee Ju-ho said the satellite, which will collect climate data, was in its correct orbit. The launch comes weeks after North Korea used its own three-stage rocket to place a satellite into orbit, sparking international criticism. South Korea's 140-tonne rocket, known as Naro, was built in partnership with Russia, which had agreed to work with Seoul for three launch attempts. Analysis: What is driving North Korea's nuclear test plan? Previous launches in 2009 and 2010 failed, and this attempt had been postponed twice for technical reasons. But officials said Wednesday's launch from the site 480km (298 miles) south of Seoul had gone as planned and that the rocket had reached its target altitude and deployed its satellite. \"After analysing various data, the Naro rocket successfully put the science satellite into designated orbit,\" Mr Lee told reporters. He said the satellite had detached 540 seconds after launch. \"We now have leapt up a step to become a space-power nation,\" he said, adding that South Korea would use this \"overwhelming moment as a strong, dynamic force\" to help drive an independent space programme. The satellite, called Science and Technology Satellite-2C, is designed to collect climate data. The Yonhap news said it was expected to make contact with its ground station at 05:00 on Thursday, at which point its operators will be able to make the final judgement on whether the launch achieved its goals. South Korea does already have satellites in space, but they were launched from other countries. On its first attempt to carry out a launch on its own soil, in 2009, the satellite failed to detach from the rocket in orbit. In 2010, the rocket exploded seconds after take-off. Pressure for success has increased since North Korea launched a rocket that placed a satellite in orbit on 12 December. It followed the launch by announcing plans for a \"high-level nuclear test\" and more long-range rocket launches. The UN said the North Korean launch constituted a banned test of missile technology and voted to extend sanctions against Pyongyang. There have been international calls for Pyongyang not to carry out the nuclear test.",

He added that the club had been put up for sale 22 hours after the FA's decision five months ago. Allam said that an appeal was being lodged against the name change rejection with the Court of Arbitration for Sport. \"We stated earlier this year that the club would be for sale should our attempt to globally promote Hull Tigers as a brand name and as a playing name be blocked,\" he said. \"As a consequence of the FA decision on 9 April, I announced on 10 April, within 22 hours, that Hull City is for sale.\" Allam, who took charge of the club in December 2010, was asked what he would do if a buyer could not be found and the legal appeal was dismissed. \"I will give it away. Out means I'm out. Have I ever said anything and gone back on it?\" he said. Allam said he and son Ehab, who is the club's acting chief executive, would remain committed to the club for the time being. \"If the appeal comes first, ok, no harm done. If the sale comes first - sold,\" he said. He was sketchy on whether there had been interest from potential buyers and indicated he may stay on should the appeal be successful. The chairman conceded that manager Steve Bruce and his players needed stability, but pointed to his investment during the transfer window, which included the signing of Uruguay striker Abel Hernandez for a reported club record fee of \u00a310m. Hull reached the FA Cup final last season, losing 3-2 to Arsenal after going two ahead, and finished 16th in their first season back in the Premier League following promotion from the Championship.

Former Republish of Ireland Under-21 player Power, 29, leaves English League Two club Lincoln City, where he made over 250 league appearances. Both players have agreed two-year contracts with the Rugby Park club, with Power's move subject to clearance. \"It feels good to be here, as it's a club that's definitely going in the right direction,\" Higgins told Kilmarnock's website.

The manager spoke about his visions for this club and it was an easy decision to make.\" McCulloch said he watch Lincoln's run to the quarter-finals of the FA Cup last season and said of Power: \"Alan played in all of those games and was the cub captain. \"He has an aggressive style of play, has a hunger to get better, and has great experience that he can pass on to the younger kids.\" Kilmarnock begin their league campaign at home to St Johnstone on 5 August.

Harrison, 24, lasted just half an hour in England's last Test match against Australia in Sydney. \"He's gone back and worked on his game very hard,\" Jones told BBC Sport. \"His last game against Castres was exceptional and he's probably our number one choice open-side flanker at the moment.\" Meanwhile Jones says the recalled flanker Tom Wood has a \"great chance\" of being selected this autumn. Wood was dropped following the Rugby World Cup, with Jones telling him his performances were \"distinctly average\". \"He's improved his work-rate, his impact as a ball carrier, and he's certainly above average now,\" Jones added. \"He's got very good lineout skills and his breakdown work has improved. So we are excited about him being in the squad. \"His [lineout work] gives him a great chance of being selected.\" Jones has selected six uncapped players in his 33-man squad, but has played down their chances of being selected against the Springboks on 12 November. \"Making your debut against South Africa is probably not the right game to make your debut,\" Jones explained.

The @RogueNASA account says it is the \"unofficial 'Resistance' team of NASA\". \"Not an official NASA account. Not managed by gov't employees. Come for the facts, stay for the snark,\" the account declares. BBC News contacted the rogue Environmental Protection Agency account called @ActualEPAFacts. They told us they acted to make sure \"factual information about climate change and other scientific research continues to be shared during the Trump administration\". They claimed to be three EPA employees and said they acted after a gagging order stopped them from doing interviews relating to their research. Media reports have suggested that the Trump administration sought to limit how certain government agencies - including the EPA - communicate with the public. The official EPA Twitter account has not posted since 19 January, a day before Mr Trump's inauguration. ActualEPAFacts told us they were surprised by how many people are now following their account - more than 90,000 currently - but also felt exposed by what they were doing. The other rogue accounts also have large numbers of followers. More than 370,000 are following @RogueNasa after a handful of tweets in a few days. The rogue National Park Service account @AltNatParkSer has attracted even more people, with more than a million followers after less than 300 tweets. There are also rogue accounts for the US Department of Agriculture, Forest Service and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They use similar phrases such as \"resistance\" to describe themselves and post a mixture of scientific information and attacks on Mr Trump. Some of those running the other alternative accounts also claimed to be disgruntled government agency workers, at least going by their tweets. The @AltNatParkSer account tweeted on Tuesday that they were \"being run by several active NPS rangers and friends\". However, on Thursday they said they were handing over to a different group of people - activists and journalists who were former scientists. On Tuesday the official account of Badlands National Park in South Dakota started tweeting about global warming, but those posts were later deleted. The people behind the @AltNatParkSer told us this inspired them to set up their Twitter account. The other alternative accounts also appear to have been created after the Badlands tweets were deleted, while some official US national park accounts also tweeted about climate change on Wednesday.

        "A report from British Marine, which represents the leisure, superyacht and small commercial marine industry, said superyacht revenues for the year to April 2016 had reached \u00a3605m. Revenues for the whole sector rose 1.6% to \u00a33.01bn, the first time the \u00a33bn mark has been breached since 2008-2009. However, the report predicted growth would slow during 2017. It said uncertainty over Brexit negotiations was likely to curb demand. Total revenue fell in the wake of financial crisis, reaching its lowest point in the financial year 2011-2012 of \u00a32,85bn and has been gradually picking up since then. Increased revenue from engine and equipment manufacturing, as well as a jump in sales of hire and charter boats, are believed to have driven the sales increase. Exports for the year were down 0.7% to \u00a3882m but British Marine said that in the last few months the industry had benefited from the fall in the pound against the dollar and the euro since the referendum, as it has boosted buying power from overseas customers. However, marine businesses surveyed for the report expected that the support from the strong pound would be a short-term benefit. Howard Pridding, chief executive of British Marine, said: \"The industry remains robust - revenue is growing and we are taking on more employees. \"Despite the post-referendum volatility impacting on business and consumer confidence, the industry remains bullish.\" The report said industry growth was expected to slow in 2017 \"as economic volatility increases closer to and during negotiations over the UK's exit from the European Union.\" Sunseeker and Princess are the UK's biggest superyacht companies.

        "The deal unveiled by Russia on Thursday to set up four \"de-escalation zones\" is backed by Turkey and Iran. But the main Syrian opposition grouping says it has little faith in the deal. Elsewhere in Syria, activists say government aircraft have hit central Hama province, and there are reports of shelling and gunfire in other parts. The opposition High Negotiations Committee (HNC), said on Friday the safe zones plan lacked \"safeguards and compliance mechanisms\". It also said it did not accept Iran as a guarantor of the deal. The UN special envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, told the BBC the agreement was important because it was being implemented by three countries who could make it work. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said Syrian fighter jets on Saturday bombed rebel positions in Hama. A rebel commander confirmed that fighting had broken out after midnight, Reuters reports. The Syrian military have so far not commented on the issue. The so-called \"memorandum on the creation of de-escalation areas\" was announced by the Russian military after talks in Kazakhstan's capital Astana. Russia's foreign ministry published the full text of the agreement on Saturday. The objective is to halt attacks by all sides and to \"provide the conditions for the safe and voluntary return of refugees\" in addition to the speedy provision of relief supplies and medical aid. The four zones will remain in place for six months, but their borders have to be finalised by Russia, Iran and Turkey by 4 June. Under the plan, the four zones will be established in: Russian Deputy Defence Minister Alexander Fomin said on Friday that there had been no bombing raids by Russian aviation in the four zones since 1 May. But he stressed that Russia's air force would continue striking militants from the Islamic State (IS) group elsewhere in Syria. The US has expressed concern over Iran, saying the country had \"only contributed to the violence, not stopped it\". The Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad is not a signatory, but its state news agency has said it supports the plan. The Astana talks were meant to shore up an oft-violated ceasefire which was originally agreed in December. A partial cessation of hostilities was declared at the end of last year, but violence has continued on several fronts. Syria's war has claimed more than 300,000 lives since it erupted in 2011.",

Labour's executive is also expected to decide candidate selection, while some challengers have come forward for the Conservatives and Lib Dems already. The UK goes to the polls on 8 June after Prime Minister Theresa May announced plans for a snap election, subsequently endorsed by MPs by 552 votes to 13. Ms McGarry and Ms Thomson were the only two Scottish MPs to vote against the election, with SNP members abstaining. If they do not return, the SNP will need to find five candidates, including three for the seats the party did not win in 2015. A number of party activists have already announced their intention to bid for the SNP ticket in the Glasgow East and Edinburgh West seats formerly occupied by the two women. On Friday, the UK Labour party issued a call for prospective for parliamentary candidates over Twitter, inviting party members to apply with a deadline of noon on Sunday. The Scottish party's executive group is meeting over the weekend to agree their selection procedure, with leader Kezia Dugdale saying they were ready and had already been preparing for an election. The party's sole MP north of the border, Ian Murray, launched his campaign to defend Edinburgh South on Friday. Scottish Secretary David Mundell then followed suit in Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale. Representatives of other parties have started to declare their candidacies for various seats.

        "The charity wants 10% of the 4.8 million Syrians displaced by civil war to be resettled by the end of the year. Ahead of UN talks in Geneva on the crisis, it highlighted figures showing only 1.4% had been helped so far. Oxfam said UK plans to resettle 20,000 Syrians by 2020 were \"not good enough\", but Britain says it is also focused on providing aid to people in the region. The UK's pledge of \u00c2\u00a32.3bn to help people affected by the humanitarian crisis caused by the civil war in Syria makes it the second largest bilateral donor in the world after the US. Oxfam says while Britain has been generous in providing financial aid for those displaced by Syria's civil war, it \"can and should do more\". It argues that countries with strong economies and developed infrastructures need to shoulder a greater responsibility towards refugees than nations such as Lebanon and Jordan, where thousands of Syrians are now based. The Geneva conference should, the UK-based charity added, result in \"urgent solutions, offering people safe and legal routes to a welcome\" in other countries. Oxfam examined the pledges of 28 nations that are members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and signatories to the 1951 Convention on Refugees. It says they have promised to take in almost 130,000 of Syrian refugees, although only 67,000 have actually arrived. The 10% of Syrian refugees Oxfam wants the rich nations to take in by the end of the 2016 represents the proportion the UN says are very vulnerable and in need of resettlement. According to Oxfam's analysis, only Canada, Germany, Norway have made resettlement pledges exceeding their \"fair share\", a measure based on the size of their economies. It says five other nations - Australia, Finland, Iceland, Sweden, New Zealand - have pledged more than half of their fare share. In contrast, the UK is set to take 22% of its fair share, the US just 7%, and France only 4%. Mark Goldring, chief executive of Oxfam GB said: \"It's shocking that while people continue to flee Syria most countries have failed to provide a safe home for the most vulnerable.\"",

Flower, of Verwood, Dorset, was given a six-month conditional discharge and ordered to pay \u00c2\u00a3930 costs.

The vote concerned whether the strategy for the area should be referred to the secretary of state for approval. He declared his interest in the charity prior to the meeting, but was found guilty of taking part in the vote \"without reasonable excuse\" despite his pecuniary interest. The core strategy included plans for redevelopment in Wimborne and, although no planning permission had been submitted, it was thought some of Synergy's social housing could be improved by developers Wyatt.

If this was uttered by the man of God, why remove it?\" Though some have defended him. \"I will always believe in your prophesies, through thick and thin,\" said South African Gugu Mathonsi.

The pair then shared an unbeaten partnership of 172 with Clark - batting at eight in the order - soon overtaking Chanderpaul's score, beating him to his half-century. The game was halted due to bad light in the evening session but that did nothing to halt Clark's progress. In total the 26-year-old - whose previous high score was 84 not out - hit 17 fours and three sixes in his innings. The change in fortunes for Lancashire was even more remarkable given they were five wickets down inside 22 overs. Footitt - who took eight wickets in Surrey's season opener win against Warwickshire - dismissed opener Alex Davies, Lancashire's stand-in captain Liam Livingstone and Dane Vilas while Sam and Tom Curran took a wicket apiece in the early flurry. Lancashire all-rounder Jordan Clark told BBC Radio Lancashire: \"It's an unbelievable feeling for me. It's put us in a position where we can dig in a bit more tomorrow and hopefully put the team in a good position. \"It looked quite tough early on against the new ball but when I came in the pitch had flattened out a little bit. \"Tomorrow the new ball is around the corner, so we've still got a lot of work to do.\"",

The chain opened 12 new stores, which helped total sales to rise 7.1%, but that increase was lower than the 11% growth seen in the previous 12 months. Sales at stores open for more than a year rose 5% - the same as last year. The privately-owned Swedish group said sales in Poland jumped about 20%, making the country its fastest-growing market, while Australia and Canada also performed well. Germany was still the retailer's largest market, closely followed by the United States. Ikea will open its first stores in India and Serbia this year and now has 340 outlets in 28 countries. However, expansion into Russia has been put on hold as Ikea seeks to solve \"a number of old legal disputes\". The chain has 19 stores in the UK, with new outlets planned for Exeter, Sheffield and southeast London. As well as opening 12 new stores in the year, Ikea opened 19 \"click and collect\" outlets globally in a response to changing consumer behaviour. Ikea recently began offering some items online for either home delivery or collection - a departure from its traditional model of customers loading flat-pack items onto a trolley themselves. Online is taking a greater share of the UK furniture and floorcoverings market, with sales up 15% last year to account for just over 12% of expenditure, according to Verdict Retail. Earlier this year, Ikea chief executive Peter Agnefjall said he expected the company to report annual sales of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac50bn by 2020. It recently began to publish its sales figures in September and profits in December. Earlier this year Ikea opened a museum in Almhult, Sweden, where founder Ingvar Kamprad opened the first store in 1958. It features many of Ikea's famous designs and products, from meatballs to bookshelves.",
        "Mr Reagan and three others were injured in the shooting outside a hotel in Washington in March 1981. Mr Hinckley was found not guilty by reason of insanity but was sent for treatment to a Washington hospital. In July, a judge ruled that Mr Hinckley, now 61, was not a danger to himself or the public. Mr Hinckley had already been spending 17 days a month at his mother's home in Virginia under strict conditions. Associated Press reported that he had arrived at her home having been freed on Saturday. Marking 30 years since Reagan's shooting Life after shooting a US president As part of his release he will: The shooting, just weeks into Ronald Reagan's presidency, shocked the world. Mr Reagan was shot in the lung, but recovered. His press secretary James Brady was shot in the head, suffered brain damage and used a wheelchair for the rest of his life. Mr Brady's death in 2014 at the age of 73 was ruled to be a homicide, but no further charges against Hinckley were brought. Two law enforcement officers suffered less serious injuries in the shooting. US District Judge Paul Friedman's judgement points to medical assessments which showed that Mr Hinckley had had \"no symptoms of active mental illness\" since 1983. He had shot the president in an apparent bid to impress the actress Jodie Foster, with whom he had an obsession and whom he had subjected to what would now be termed stalking. The court order and opinion available on the website of the US District Court for the District of Columbia spell out the terms of Mr Hinckley's release, and detail his psychiatric history and treatment:",
        "The company behind the abattoir in Haverfordwest, Emcol 2008 Ltd, collapsed in January 2016 with debts of \u00a3660,000 to more than 230 creditors. One director said it was due to escalating costs and being owed money. Newport dairy farmer John Sollis called it a \"disaster\" for people in the area who were owed money. Documents lodged on the Companies House website show one livestock trader is owed in excess of \u00a3107,000, while others are owed significant five figure sums. In his report, liquidator Gary Stones said any payments to unsecured creditors were \"totally dependent on the collection of the Irish book debt\". The report indicated almost \u00a3470,000 was owed to Emcol by an Irish firm. Mr Sollis, who is owed almost \u00a315,000 by Emcol, said: \"It was a disaster in a sense the amount of money that people have lost in the locality and not now having a local abattoir to move stock to or casualties. \"Casualties and stock have to go further afield and that's costing us money.\" The nearest abattoir is in Cross Hands, Carmarthenshire. NFU Cymru President Stephen James is owed just over \u00a31,000 and said the loss of the abattoir was a \"huge blow\" as it dealt with injured cows. He said injured cows now had to be shot on the farm premises, resulting in a loss for farmers. One of Emcol's directors, Helen Lewis, said the collapse was down to a \"very significant amount of money\" owed to the company by an Irish firm, and the \"escalating costs of running an abattoir\". She said she had \"every sympathy\" for farmers who had lost out and \"she knew many personally\".",

Andrew Bayne, 37, of Trundleys Terrace, and his nephew Michael Bagnall, 22, of Hospital Way - both in Lewisham - were found guilty of the murder. They will be sentenced at the Old Bailey on 20 November. The court heard Mr Purdy and two of his friends - Callum Malone and Jack Walker - confronted Bagnell, and, following the \"skirmish\" last November, the defendants drove around Bermondsey looking for Mr Purdy. When they found him in Mossington Gardens, Andrew Bayne shot Mr Purdy in the head then pointed the gun towards Callum before making off. Mr Purdy suffered \"catastrophic injuries\" and died the next day, the court heard. Despite the fact Bagnall had a new girlfriend, prosecutor Crispin Aylett QC told jurors, it still \"rankled\" that she had moved on and he sent her \"threatening messages\" by phone and on Facebook. Mr Aylett said: \"Ben obviously had enough and so that Sunday, around lunchtime, with two friends to help - Callum and Jack - the three of them decided to go and confront Michael Bagnall and have it out with him. \"It was undoubtedly a very stupid thing to have sought to do and cost Ben Purdy his life.\" Bayne was also convicted of possessing a gun with intent and Bagnall of affray. As the guilty verdicts were delivered, Michael Bagnall began shouting and swearing in the dock and had to be removed by officers.",

John Summers, chief executive of the orchestra, said the project would use music to \"raise aspirations\" across other academic subjects. The school, proposed with the City Learning Trust, would be part of the free schools programme - and approval for its opening depends on the Department for Education. But the orchestra wants to open the school in September 2020, for seven to 19-year-olds, with the promise of masterclasses from musicians, access to concerts and artists in residence. The intention is for students to spend 40% of their time in specialist music classes, working with the Halle Choir, The Halle Youth Orchestra and Halle for Youth. \"The Halle has a huge amount of expertise and experience in working at high level performance, both in terms of instrumental coaching and choral training,\" said John Summers, chief executive of the Halle. \"Through our expertise we will also help develop music in the curriculum as a means of supporting academic achievement and aspiration.\" There are precedents for such a connection between orchestras and schools. In the German city of Bremen, there has been a high-profile partnership when a leading orchestra set up its rehearsal rooms and headquarters in a comprehensive school on a housing estate. The musicians of the Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie Bremen became part of the daily life of the school - and truancy rates were lowered and academic results improved.",

Belgian broadcaster described the march as \"calm and silent\". The march had been due to be held a week after the 22 March attacks, but officials asked for it to be postponed because of the security threat. Relatives of victims, and paramedics and airport staff affected by the attacks joined people of several religious faiths on Sunday's march. Flowers were carried in memory of those who lost their lives. The procession took them past the Molenbeek neighbourhood - where many of those alleged to have carried out the attacks in both Brussels and Paris had lived - and to the makeshift memorial outside the city's stock exchange. One of the organisers of the march, Hassan Bousetta, told the AFP news agency: \"When our fellow citizens, defenceless civilians, are cut down in a cowardly attack, all citizens should stand up to express their disgust and solidarity.\" The turnout was less than half of the 15,000 organisers had hoped for. The attacks in Brussels were claimed by the Islamic State militant group, which also said it was behind the gun and bomb attacks in Paris on 13 November that killed 130 people. Belgian police have made dozens of arrests in recent weeks, but the authorities - and other security agencies in Europe - are under pressure amid revelations of alleged failures and missed opportunities to stop the terror cell that carried out both attacks.",

Cairn, which made two discoveries in the area last year, estimated fields there could contain more than a billion barrels of oil. Its evaluation plan will start shortly with a 3D seismic survey. Later this year it aims to launch a multi-well exploration and appraisal programme. Edinburgh-based Cairn has a 40% interest in three blocks offshore Senegal (Sangomar Deep, Sangomar Offshore, Rufisque Offshore). Its partners include ConocoPhillips (35%) and FAR Ltd (15%), with Petrosen, the Senegal National Oil Company, retaining a 10% interest in the exploration phase. In its latest half-yearly report, Cairn also said that it had started international arbitration proceedings with the government of India over a tax row. Cairn has been prevented by Indian authorities from accessing the value of its 10% residual shareholding in Cairn India Limited (CIL). In March, the company received a tax bill for $1.6bn plus interest and penalties, covering the tax year 2006-07, when it was preparing to float Cairn India on the Mumbai stock exchange. Cairn has contested the bill and plans to seek restitution for losses resulting from the falling value of its stake in CIL. Due to the lower oil price, its value has dropped from $1bn in December 2013 to $526m, as at 30 June this year. The lower valuation saw Cairn book a $177.1m impairment loss in its first half, as it reported a post-tax loss of $230m - up from $62m a year ago. The company generates no revenue because its focus is exploration work. However, at the end of the first half, Cairn reported a cash balance of $725m. Cairn's share price was down by about 5% on Tuesday morning.",

Officials imposed a curfew in the Iraqi capital, which has now been lifted. It was the second time this month that protesters had managed to break into the city's government area. Shia Muslim cleric Moqtada Sadr condemned the use of force, and voiced support for the demonstrators' \"peaceful [and] spontaneous revolt\". At least 50 demonstrators are said to have been wounded. The protesters accuse the government of neglecting much-needed reforms, as it struggles with its campaign against the so-called Islamic State group (IS) and declining oil revenues. The Sunni jihadist group controls parts of western and northern Iraq and has been behind a wave of recent attacks that have left dozens killed. Some demonstrators managed to break into the prime minister's office and parliament. Baghdad's Green Zone houses the parliament, key government buildings and many foreign embassies. The authorities later said they had completely regained control of the area and the protesters had withdrawn. The Shia cleric and his militia group, the Mehdi Army, gained prominence after the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. galvanising anti-US sentiment. Mr Sadr's followers clashed repeatedly with US forces, whose withdrawal the cleric consistently demanded. An arrest warrant was issued for Mr Sadr in 2004 in connection with the murder of a rival cleric. His militia was also blamed for the torture and killing of thousands of Sunnis in the sectarian carnage of 2006 and 2007. Mr Sadr fled to Iran during that period. In 2011, Mr Sadr returned from his self-imposed exile to Iraq, taking a more conciliatory tone and calling for Iraqi unity and peace. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, who came to power in 2014, has promised to stamp out corruption and ease sectarian tensions. He has been pressing for radical reforms and wants to form a government of technocrats, but has been blocked by lawmakers, the BBC's Jim Muir in Baghdad reports.

Akhtar was jailed for 14 years at Birmingham Crown Court. Read more updates on this story and more from across Stoke and Staffordshire Following a trial last month, the 60-year-old, of Farman Close in Fenton, was convicted of 11 charges including five of conspiracy to commit fraud and cheating Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) out of \u00c2\u00a3271,000. The court heard how Akhtar, who was also known as Saint Pirwali Pandariman, masterminded the conspiracy over more than a decade, between 2003 and 2014. Originally from Pakistan, he was a prominent faith leader in Fenton and helped raise several million pounds in donations to fight poverty through the area's Darbar Unique Centre, the court heard. But judge Stephen Eyre said he had \"let down his followers\". He said: \"[You used] the prestige and devotion of others to facilitate this offending. \"Your role as a spiritual guide provided cover and you financed your activities through donations obtained in part because of your spiritual role\". The court heard how Akhtar kept his name off most of the paperwork, using his wife, daughter and niece to apply for mortgages. When police searched homes and offices connected to the group in September 2012, they uncovered forged documents and emails relating to the conspiracy. His wife Khadija Akhtar, 54, of Hartwell Lane, Stoke, was convicted of offences including cheating HMRC and conspiracy to obtain a money transfer by deception. She was jailed for four years and three months. Akhtar's daughter, Rushbamani Akhtar, 29, was sentenced to three-and-a-half years after being convicted of entering into an arrangement to facilitate the acquisition, retention, use or control of criminal property and conspiracy to commit fraud.

The prosecution at Newport Crown Court has alleged she was so drunk she could not have consented to sex. The defendant, who is Romanian and lives in Cardiff, denies rape. The court heard the woman lost her friends during her night out and started to walk home along Greyfriars Road, under an underpass by City Hall and then along Museum Avenue at about 02:00 GMT. It was here she was approached by the defendant and the alleged rape happened behind a bush. Claire Pickthall, prosecuting, told the jury the victim was \"so drunk she can't remember the incident happening. She can't even remember him having sex with her\". It was this intoxication, she said, that meant she was not in any state to consent. \"The actions in these circumstances amount to rape,\" Ms Pickthall said. \"He was preying on single, drunk females.\" The court heard Lee Neill, who saw Mr Hamza walking behind the National Museum of Wales with the victim, was so concerned he followed them. Suspecting something \"sinister\", Mr Neill said he took a photograph \"to use as evidence\". The flash frightened Mr Hamza, who ran off, the jury was told. After giving chase, Mr Neill lost Mr Hamza and returned to the alleged victim. He then called the police. However, the court heard when officers spoke to the victim, she was so confused she thought Mr Neill was the man who raped her. He was arrested and questioned but later released. DNA later led police to arrest Mr Hamza, the court was told. The woman told jurors she had drunk wine, cider and cocktails during her night out.

Edward Farmer initially told St Albans Crown Court he saw her in a car in Broadstairs, Kent, between mid-April and June, but later admitted the sighting could have been weeks earlier. The jury heard he claimed to have seen Ms Bailey on Charlotte Street, near to her holiday home in the town, \"driving what looked to be a Range Rover or that type of 4x4, a dark colour\". He said Ms Bailey was by herself, despite defence claims she had been kidnapped by two violent men who had taken her to Broadstairs.

        "The Republican sought to laugh off the comment, which was preceded by the supporter saying: \"We have a problem in this country - it's called Muslims\". The comments were made at a campaign rally for Mr Trump in New Hampshire. Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton said his failure to denounce \"hateful rhetoric\" was \"disturbing and wrong\". Pointing to his first questioner at the campaign event in Rochester, the billionaire businessman said: \"I like this guy.\" \"We have a problem in this country called Muslims,\" the man said. \"We know our current president is one. You know he's not even an American.\" \"We need this question?\" Mr Trump said, laughing. \"But anyway,\" the man continued, \"we have training camps growing where they want to kill us. That's my question: When can we get rid of them?\" Mr Trump failed to clarify that Mr Obama is a Christian American, instead replying that \"bad things are happening\" and saying he would look into them. Mrs Clinton joined criticism of Mr Trump on social media, tweeting: \"Donald Trump not denouncing false statements about POTUS & hateful rhetoric about Muslims is disturbing & just plain wrong. Cut it out.\" In a statement, Democratic National Committee chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz said Mr Trump's \"racism knows no bounds\". Mr Trump's campaign manager Corey Lewandowski sought to play down the incident, telling US media that \"all he heard was a question about training camps\". \"The media wants to make this issue about Obama. The bigger issue is that Obama is waging a war against Christians in this country,\" Mr Lewandowski told the Washington Post. The incident evoked a moment during the 2008 campaign when Republican nominee John McCain took the microphone away from a woman who said she did not trust Mr Obama because he was \"an Arab\". President Obama, who has spoken openly about his Christian faith, was born to an American mother and Kenyan father in Hawaii. But Mr Trump has been one of the leading sceptics, challenging Mr Obama in 2011 to produce his birth certificate to disprove rumours that he was born in Kenya, which the president did.

Mr Corbyn has been highly critical of the government's response to the Calais migrant crisis and says the UK must do more. He told me: \"These are human beings, these are people in desperate situations - they need our help and they need our support. \"There's a very large number of people going over to Calais to take aid and support to them - we should be part of the European programme both for Syrian refugees and other refugees.\" His views on immigration are completely at odds with those of the UK Independence Party - whose leader Nigel Farage addressed his annual conference in Doncaster on the issue today. He questioned how any government could plan for school provision, for health provision if you don't know in a couple of years time - to the nearest million - how many people would actually be living in the country. And the Kent Conservative MP and former immigration minister Damian Green also says open-door immigration would be irresponsible. But Mr Corbyn insists that immigration is positive for the UK. \"Our health service, our education service, much of our industrial development in Britain, has been greatly enhanced by the work done by people who have made their homes here, paid their taxes here, worked very hard here and given us this amazing cosmopolitan society that we have.\" He said instead of being afraid of immigration people should welcome the opportunities it brings. No doubt that's a message he'll want to get across to the troops as they meet in Brighton this weekend. He'll also want to address other key issues such as the housing shortage, investment in infrastructure and his opposition to benefits reform.

Burmese bar workers Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Tun were found guilty of the killings in December 2015. An appeal court in Thailand upheld the death sentences handed down to them. Lawyers for the two men now have 30 days to appeal to the Supreme Court - Thailand's final court of appeal. The pair's mothers lodged appeals at Koh Samui court last May over concerns about the judgements, in particular the DNA evidence used in the investigation. \"We don't believe the court can say beyond reasonable doubt that Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo were responsible for the events which took place in September 2014,\" said Andy Hall, one of the families' legal advisors. Miss Witheridge, a University of Essex student from Hemsby, and Mr Miller, a civil and structural engineering graduate, were found on a beach having been bludgeoned to death. A post-mortem examination showed Miss Witheridge had been raped. Prosecutors said DNA evidence collected from cigarette butts, a condom and the bodies of the victims linked Lin and Phyo to the deaths. The men, from Myanmar, retracted their initial confessions to the offences, saying they had been tortured by police. Their lawyers argued DNA from a garden hoe - allegedly used as the murder weapon - did not match samples taken from the men. They also claimed evidence had been mishandled by police and the pair's confessions were the result of \"systematic abuse\" of migrants in the area.",
        "That amount is equivalent to the combined economies of Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom, the report by the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP) said. The divide between the most peaceful and the least peaceful nations was deepening, the annual report added. Iceland is the world's most peaceful nation, whilst Syria is the least. Libya saw the most severe deterioration over the course of 2014, according to the Australia-based IEP says. The Middle East and North Africa now ranks as the world's most violent region, overtaking South Asia which received that ranking for 2013. Conflict killed 180,000 people in 2014, compared with 49,000 in 2010, the report said. Deaths caused by terrorism increased by 61% in 2013, the report said, with the loss of almost 18,000 lives - mostly in just five countries, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nigeria and Syria. Figures compared If the world decreased in violence by 10%, it would generate \u00c2\u00a31.43tn, says the IEP. This amount is equivalent to: Source: IEP The most surprising finding, said IEP Chief Executive Steve Killelea, was the \"inequality with peace\" around the world. He said some countries in Western Europe had now reached \"quite historic levels of peace\", enjoying the lowest levels of murder rates and money spent on security \"probably in the countries' history\". But Iraq, Syria, Nigeria, South Sudan and the Central African Republic had all become more violent in the past year, the report said. The IEP said the total costs of conflict amounted to 13.4% of world GDP. \"Large increases in costs have occurred due to deaths from internal conflict, IDPs [internally displaced people] and refugee support, UN peacekeeping and GDP losses from conflict,\" the report said. It also noted that the cost of supporting some 50 million refugees and IDPs - the largest number since WWII - had risen 267% since 2008 to $128bn. The report also found that if global violence were to decrease by 10%, it would effectively give the world economy an additional $1.43 trillion - more than six times the amount needed to wipe out Greece's debts, and three times more than the total earnings of some 1.1bn of the world's poorest people.",

Ms Jones said: \"Our action will send a clear message to callous cold-callers operating in Swansea that they must follow the rules. \"We'd previously contacted both of these companies but they showed a blatant disregard for the law by continuing to make nuisance calls. Their action left many people feeling frustrated and harassed.\" Sandra Busby, managing director of the Welsh Contact Centre Forum said: \"There will always be a place in the market for credible companies who want to contact their existing customers and, as consumers, we occasionally want to find out about the best deals, offers and preferential rates. \"The market becomes very tricky when you have disreputable, unethical companies in it for a quick buck, flagrantly disregarding rules and giving the industry a bad name. The Welsh Contact Centre Forum is about the former, helping companies continually strive for best practice.\" The latest action came as the ICO published its updated Direct Marketing Guidance, which helps organisations understand the law and follow good practice.",
        "The walkout is in protest over the dismissal of two nurses involved in a violent struggle with a patient. Kevin Gregson and Peter Hilton were sacked despite using \"reasonable force\" against the unidentified patient, said the Prison Officers' Association (POA). But Mersey Care Trust, which runs Ashworth, said the evidence meant sacking the pair was its only option. More on this story and other news from Merseyside and Cheshire The dispute at the unit, one of three high security hospitals in England and Wales, began at 07:00 GMT. Steve Gillan, the POA's general secretary, said: \"I believe the general public will be outraged and extremely sympathetic to Mr Hilton and Mr Gregson, who were merely responding to a violent act in which the patient had headbutted a colleague and was spitting at staff during the incident. \"The actions of restraint were reasonable and the patient came to no harm, unlike the nurses. Whilst there should always be a duty of care towards patients the same must apply to staff.\" The trust said it was \"disappointed\" by the union's decision to strike before the case is heard at an independent employment tribunal. \"We do not believe this is in the best interests of our patients, our carers, our staff and the communities we serve,\" it said in a statement. Referring to the nurses' case the trust said it cares for \"some of the most complex and vulnerable adults in a hospital setting\". \"[And we] have an international and award-winning reputation for doing so,\" it said. \"This means our staff are highly trained... We never dismiss staff lightly. \"In the light of the evidence we felt we had no other course of action open to us than to dismiss two staff members.\" The other high-security psychiatric hospitals in England and Wales are Rampton in Nottinghamshire and Broadmoor in Berkshire.",
        "Charles Blackman's oil work Women Lovers features two nude women resting on a bed beside a cat. Art broker Mossgreen tried to promote it on Facebook, but the social media network rejected it for \"advertising adult products or services\". Mossgreen chief executive Paul Summer said the decision was \"ridiculous\". \"This is a very beautiful image that is not overtly sexual in any shape or form,\" he told the BBC. \"It's like going back to the 1950s. It's ridiculous to censor this sort of thing.\" Facebook said its decision was final, although Mossgreen has since reposted images of the work. \"Such ads lead to negative user sentiment and we have zero tolerance towards such advertisements,\" Facebook said in a message. Last month, a French teacher took Facebook to court after it suspended his account for posting an image of a nude woman painted by 19th Century artist Gustave Courbet. Mr Summer said Women Lovers was expected to sell for more than A$45,000 (\u00c2\u00a328,000; $34,000) at auction next week. \"Nobody said a single thing until Facebook suddenly decided it was going to offend somebody,\" he said. \"I don't know who they're protecting because I have two teenage daughters myself and if I said to them that this painting has been banned I think they would have laughed at me.\" Now aged 88, Blackman has been described as \"the last man standing\" from one of the great eras in Australian art. His contemporaries included modernist painters Arthur Boyd, Sidney Nolan and Albert Tucker. Last year, Blackman's painting The Game of Chess was sold by Sotheby's Australia for A$1.78m. \"Charles Blackman is the most well-regarded and respected living Australian artist,\" Mr Summer said.",
        "The Spy Who Came In From The Cold, set at the height of the Cold War, is being adapted by the Oscar-winning writer of Slumdog Millionaire, Simon Beaufoy. It follows Alec Leamas, a hard-drinking British intelligence officer whose East Berlin network is in tatters. Le Carre said he was \"very excited\" by the show, which will appear on BBC One. The series will be another co-production with US network AMC, following their joint effort on The Night Manager. Tom Hiddleston, Hugh Laurie and Olivia Colman all won Golden Globes for their roles in the drama, while the show itself was nominated for best mini series or TV film at the awards. The Spy Who Came In From The Cold is set in 1962, months after the building of the Berlin Wall. In the story, Leamas's agents are either on the run or dead - victims of the East German counter-intelligence officer Hans-Dieter Mundt. Leamas is recalled to London where he is offered a chance at revenge. The novel, written in 1963, was made into a film starring Richard Burton in 1965 and le Carre said he was looking forward to seeing it on screen again. He said: \"I'm very excited by the project, and have great confidence in the team.\" Beaufoy added: \"It's incredibly exciting to be working on the best Cold War spy story ever written.\" The show will be produced by The Ink Factory, the production company behind The Night Manager, in association with Character 7. Piers Wenger, controller of BBC Drama, said: \"Following the huge global success of The Night Manager, it's a privilege to announce that John le Carre will return to BBC One with one of the best spy thrillers ever written.\"",

According to the OUP, new technology is increasingly at the centre of the children's lives but how they are writing about it is changing fast. Words including email, mobile and Facebook are in decline, it said. They are being replaced by the likes of Instagram, Snapchat and emoji. And the word television has now been superseded by phone. The report also notes a sudden new arrival in children's sentences. The use of the hashtag symbol # to add an extra meaning or comment at the end of a sentence has become commonplace. #IblameTwitter #AndInstagram. Vineeta Gupta at the Oxford University Press said: \"This has been a significant change in usage in this year, 2015. \"Children have extended its [#] use from a simple prefix or as a search term for Twitter to an editorial device to add drama or comment.\" Other words on the technological endangered list are iPod, mp3 and Blackberry. In their place are iPhone, chat app WhatsApp and messaging site ooVoo. #keepup One of the most common plotlines in the short story competition was achieving sudden internet fame after posting a YouTube video. Rather than writing about watching videos, stories revolved around how many hits, shares and likes they were receiving for their own videos. #makesabetterstory Some of the most popular characters were Cinderella, footballer Lionel Messi, Snow White, Adolf Hitler and Wayne Rooney. What surprised researchers was how many children wrote using mythological characters such as Zeus, the Minotaur and Hercules. #theyloveZeus As a source for stories, World War One was common and world events in Ukraine and Syria were both popular but far behind the most frequent current affairs topic, Ebola. The search for a cure was one of the most regular plots. New words also appeared. Among the crop of new inventions were wellysaurus, gloomful and Stegasuarez, a mutant monster hybrid of a Stegosaurus and footballer Luis Suarez. #itbites The contest winners will be revealed on Friday on The Chris Evans Breakfast Show on BBC Radio 2 live from St James's Palace.

        "The 23-year-old Heracles forward claimed he was waiting to finalise a move to the Championship club. Slade insisted there was no truth to the reports but admitted he did have some interest in the player \"some time ago\". \"To my knowledge that's not something we're going to pursue,\" he said. Netherlands Under-21 international Weghorst began his career with FC Emmen before joining Heracles in 2014. Heracles chairman Jam Smit believed a fee had been agreed with Cardiff for Weghorst, who has also been linked with Celtic. \"I think all the forcing and all the speculation surrounding the player appears to be have come from the Netherlands,\" added Slade. \"There was an initial inquiry some time ago. That's all I can say.\" Slade would like to make up to three signings during the window to aid Bluebirds' push for a Championship play-off place, with the club currently four points off the top six. One is likely to be a striker after the departure of last season's top scorer Kenwyne Jones to Al Jazira in the United Arab Emirates. The Trinidad and Tobago international claimed on social media that the club had offered him no fresh deal to stay, but Slade believes that was not the case, \"I'm pretty sure there was a dialogue going on between Kenwyne's people, Kenwyne himself and [chief executive] Ken Choo and the board of directors,\" Slade added. He also denied claims from Rotherham Manager Neil Redfearn that the two clubs are in talks over a potential transfer for Alex Revell. Revell, 32, joined Cardiff from Rotherham in January 2015 and has scored twice in 15 league games for the Bluebirds. \"We've already lost a target type centre forward,\" said Slade. \"We need to be mindful that we're not shooting ourselves in the foot and that we have enough players in every position and every area of the pitch.\" Cardiff host League One Shrewsbury Town on Sunday in the third round of the FA Cup with defender Lee Peltier a major doubt because of illness.",
        "The walk-in service is aimed at reducing doctor appointments and to help reduce the over-use of antibiotics, NHS England said. It is hoped the scheme could result in fewer visits to GPs -potentially saving the NHS millions of pounds a year. But pharmacies say cuts in funding to the sector could jeopardise the scheme. The Sore Throat Test and Treat service, which has been trialled in 35 Boots pharmacies, will determine if an illness is caused by a virus - meaning drugs will not help - or a bacterial infection. Results from a throat swab, which measures sugars on the tongue, are provided in five minutes. Patients who can be helped by antibiotics will be prescribed them by the pharmacist and not have to see a GP. NHS chief executive Simon Stevens said the scheme will be rolled out across the country over the coming year. Dr Adam Roberts, a microbiologist at University College London specialising in antibiotic resistance, told the BBC it was \"quite an innovative step\". He said: \"Anything that reduces our reliance and our inappropriate use of antibiotics is a good thing. \"The initial data they showed using this kit showed that of around 360 individuals that took part only 36 were given a prescription, which is a massive reduction.\" Claire Ward, chairwoman of Pharmacy Voice, which represents the trade, welcomed the roll-out and said it was the \"kind of thing community pharmacies should be undertaking\". But she warned that cuts to services could prevent the scheme from working. In October, the Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee told the BBC that the government had drawn up proposals to cut funding by 12% from December. The Department of Health said no final decision had been made. The throat test is one of eight medical innovations being introduced to help the NHS modernise in the face of increasing demand. Sir Bruce Keogh, NHS England's national medical director, said \"innovation is not an option but a necessity if we are to build a sustainable NHS\". \"The innovations selected for this programme have the potential to deliver better value for the taxpayer whilst making patient interactions with the NHS safer and more personal,\" he said.",
        "The Sakurajima volcano on Japan's Kyushu island poses a \"growing threat\", researchers at the University of Bristol say. The volcano, located 49 km (30 miles) from the Sendai nuclear plant, is also close to Kagoshima, a city of 600,000. Sakurajima's last deadly eruption was in 1914, when 58 people died. The Japanese archipelago, which sits on the Pacific \"Ring of fire\", has more than 100 volcanoes. Sakurajima regularly spews ash and there are many small explosions there each year, with the latest eruption being in February. It is closely monitored by Japanese authorities and one of two volcanoes at Level 3 out of 5 levels in Japan's volcanic warning system, which means that people are warned not to to approach the volcano. \"The 1914 eruption measured about 1.5km cubed in volume,\" said the study's lead author Dr James Hickey, who has now joined the University of Exeter's Camborne School of Mines. \"From our data we think it would take around 130 years for the volcano to store the same amount of magma for another eruption of a similar size- meaning we are around 25 years away.\" A report on the activity of the volcano was published on Tuesday and teams from Bristol University and the Sakurajima Volcano Research Centre took part. Their research showed that 14 million cubic metres of magma is accumulating each year, enough to fill London's Wembley Stadium 3.5 times over. They added that the rate at which the magma is accumulating is faster than it can be expelled in its regular smaller eruptions, which led them to infer that a major eruption is likely in the next 30 years. They made these assessments based on new ways of studying and modelling the volcano's magma reservoir. Scientists say they hope these findings can help authorities plan for major eruptions. \"We know that being forewarned means we are forearmed and providing essential information for local authorities can potentially help save lives if an eruption was imminent,\" said Dr Hickey. According to an associate professor at Kyoto University, new evacuation plans have already been prepared. \"It is already passed by 100 years since the 1914 eruption, less than 30 years is left until a next expected big eruption\", said Dr Haruhisa Nakamichi, Associate Professor at the Disaster Prevention Research Institute, Kyoto University. \"Kagoshima city office has prepared a new evacuation plan from Sakurajima.\""

        "The ban was endorsed by local authorities in Urumqi, as reported by state media. This move represents the most recent measure in an ongoing campaign against Islamic clothing and symbols within the predominantly Muslim region. The Chinese government attributes a series of recent attacks to Uighur militants, yet activists argue that these violent incidents are a byproduct of Chinese repression. Traditionally, the Uighurs practice a moderate form of Islam, but in recent years, the infiltration of more stringent interpretations from the Gulf and Pakistan has led to an increase in the number of women adopting face coverings. According to Charles Scanlon, the BBC's Asia Pacific editor, the Chinese authorities perceive the wearing of an Islamic face veil as an act of defiance amidst rising violence in the region. This past August, the northern city of Karamay implemented a ban preventing men with long beards from boarding buses. Some experts warn that such restrictions could have unintended consequences, especially at a time when many Uighurs feel that their cultural identity is under siege. James Leibold, a specialist in China's ethnic policy from Melbourne's La Trobe University, explained to Reuters news agency that the veil ban could become a potent symbol of resistance and a declaration of ethno-national identity. He observed that China's Communist party has explicitly connected certain styles of Islamic dress with religious extremism. The law passed in Urumqi is poised to be enacted following its approval by a regional body. Chinese authorities have linked a spate of recent violence, some of which has targeted civilians in public spaces, to Uighur militants who are allegedly influenced or supported by international terror organizations. In response, a crackdown in the region has led to the arrest and imprisonment of numerous individuals. However, Uighur activists contend that China's heavy-handed tactics in Xinjiang, encompassing cultural and religious",
        "Palmer anticipates receiving a fine from the British Horseracing Authority (BHA) due to a regulatory infraction that occurred during Champions Day. He explained to BBC Sport that the incident was \"an oversight,\" as the incorrect kit box was inadvertently left in the lorry and consequently transported to the stables. Palmer, who is a Newmarket-based trainer, watched as his horse, Galileo Gold, secured a fifth-place finish in the prestigious Group One Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot. According to racing regulations, horses are strictly permitted to consume only hay-feed and water prior to a race; however, certain substances like electrolytes are allowed after the competition. This incident led to interviews by stewards with employees of Palmer and fellow trainers Francois Rohaut and Jean-Claude Rouget, following a report from the Equine Welfare and Integrity Officer. Palmer is still awaiting the BHA's decision regarding the specific penalties that will be imposed. He expressed to BBC Radio Berkshire his expectation of a typical fine, emphasizing that there is no implication of intent to gain an unfair advantage or engage in cheating. Palmer acknowledged, \"The rules are the rules and you need to stick to them.\" Robin Mounsey, a media spokesperson for the BHA, clarified that while three of the substances found were electrolytes that are permissible within the stables, they had not been appropriately cleared beforehand. The other substance is allowed during training sessions but is not sanctioned on race days. All horses involved, including Signs Of Blessing, Architecture, Galileo Gold, and Almanzor, the latter being the Champion Stakes winner, underwent standard testing procedures. In related developments, Palmer has confirmed that Galileo Gold will continue to race in the upcoming season, maintaining his training regimen. Palmer remarked on the rarity and value of such exceptional horses, stating, \"Horses",

Despite her denials, a disciplinary panel concluded that it was probable that contact with the pupil had occurred, leading them to determine that her conduct was \"unacceptable.\" On Thursday, the Education Workforce Council imposed a suspension, underscoring the point that \"the public interest is in favour of her being able to teach again.\" Mrs. Hungerford acknowledged that she had indeed shouted and slammed a book on the desk of the teenager, whom she described as \"provocative and disruptive,\" while he was listening to rap music. However, she consistently denied the accusation of having hit the student's head. Although she was initially charged with criminal assault during a maths lesson for those with learning difficulties, she was cleared on appeal. Nevertheless, in November, a disciplinary panel found, on the balance of probabilities, that she had made physical contact with the pupil, either on the head or hand. The panel concluded that her actions amounted to \"acting in an inappropriate way\" and deemed it professional misconduct. Throughout the hearing, Mrs. Hungerford, who is a mother of three, implored the panel to consider the impact on her \"very rewarding\" career, which she described as having been \"ruined\" by what she termed a \"miscarriage of justice.\" Despite the turmoil, she expressed a strong desire to continue teaching. On Thursday, Mrs. Hungerford was informed of a four-month suspension from the teaching register, with the possibility of",
        "As she stood at the podium on that somber Thursday, the air was thick with the weight of memory and unresolved conflict. The event was held in the small, tight-knit village of Clonoe, where the echoes of the past seemed to resonate more strongly than in most places. It was here that Michelle O'Neill found herself amidst a crowd gathered to honor four men who had been cut down in their prime by the Special Air Service in 1992. These men, members of the IRA, had met their end after an audacious attack on the Coalisland police station, a moment forever etched into the village's fabric. As Mrs. O'Neill delivered her speech, her voice carried both the solemnity of remembrance and the defiance of one standing firm against criticism.\n\nHer decision to attend the event was met with a predictable wave of disapproval from political adversaries. DUP leader Arlene Foster expressed her disappointment, though she was not taken aback by O'Neill's presence. \"Mrs. O'Neill was wrong to attend,\" Foster declared, her words underscored by the unyielding tensions that have long defined Northern Ireland's political landscape. Despite this, O'Neill remained steadfast, her conviction unwavering. \"There are some who would say we have no right to remember or to honor them,\" she asserted, her words echoing through the room, \"but we have absolutely every right. Everyone, it doesn't matter who you are, has the right to remember their dead in a respectful and dignified manner.\"\n\nThe incident that claimed the lives of the four IRA men was a grim chapter in a long and bloody conflict.

        "Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) expressed concerns regarding the staffing levels within the police force, describing them as \"fragile\" and emphasizing the urgent need for the implementation of improvement plans. This assessment followed a visit by inspectors who had earlier criticized the force in response to government spending cuts. Police and Crime Commissioner Olly Martins argued that the report's findings were outdated, suggesting that the report did not accurately reflect the current state of the force. In the previous year's HMIC report titled \"Policing in Austerity: Meeting the Challenge\", Bedfordshire Police was rated as \"requiring improvement\", prompting inspectors to monitor the force closely. Upon returning in October, inspectors found that Bedfordshire was underperforming when compared to similar forces. A significant issue identified was within the force control room, though it was noted that a recent increase in staffing might lead to improvements. While acknowledging recruitment efforts, the report labeled staffing levels as \"fragile but improving\" and raised concerns about the lack of clear investment in preventive measures to reduce demand. The report pointed out the risk of neglecting long-term challenges. Inspectors stressed the necessity of implementing the force's improvement plans in a cost-effective manner while maintaining effective service delivery. Despite these issues, the report noted that the force was progressing positively and that the pace of change was accelerating. Commissioner Martins criticized the publication of the report, arguing it could potentially harm police morale and mislead the public due to its outdated nature. He questioned the competence of issuing a report that was seven months old when further assessments had already been conducted. HMIC responded by stating that",

This stunning Unesco World Heritage Site boasts about 40,000 magnificent black basalt columns, which seem to rise majestically from the sea like the teeth of some mythical giant. It was an exciting visit for the Royal couple, marking their inaugural trip to Northern Ireland's most iconic tourist magnet. You see, this wonder of nature took shape when molten rock was driven up through crevices in the earth's crust, creating a vast lava plateau over time.\n\nFollowing the marvel of nature, the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh made their way to the quaint village of Bushmills. They were there to honor a local hero, Robert Quigg, with a heartwarming ceremony. Now, Sgt Quigg is a name that echoes through history for his extraordinary bravery during the harrowing Battle of the Somme. His gutsy actions in the line of fire, as he searched tirelessly for his commanding officer, earned him the prestigious Victoria Cross, the top military accolade for valor. The Royal couple paid tribute by unveiling a statue and a commemorative stone in his honor. And to add a personal touch to the occasion, Sgt Quigg's grandnephew, Leonard Quigg, delivered a heartfelt speech.\n\nFrom Bushmills, it was off to a rather regal reception at Portrush Golf Club, where they were the esteemed guests of the mayor of the Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council. Then, it was time for a nostalgic journey back in time aboard a charming steam train, traveling from Coleraine in County Londonderry to the quaint village of Bellarena. People flocked to Coleraine, eager for a glimpse of the Royal pair as they boarded the vintage five-carriage train, which dates back to 1932. Accompanied by enthusiastic local schoolchildren, the journey was a delightful blend of history and tradition, culminating in the official opening of Bellarena's new train station by the Queen herself.\n\nRewinding to a significant chapter, the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh had first traveled this very route along the historic Coleraine to Londonderry railway line back in 1953, the year of her coronation.

        "The Institute of Public Policy Research (IPPR), a prominent centre-left think tank, has released a compelling report highlighting a significant disparity in educational attainment between the poorest children in London and those in the north of England. This report, launched in Sheffield, underscores a critical issue that has been festering within the UK's socio-economic tapestry: the uneven educational outcomes linked to geographical and economic divides. According to the IPPR's findings, a mere 47% of children born into the poorest families in the north achieve a satisfactory level of early years development, starkly contrasted with 59% in London. This disparity is not just a statistic; it represents a failure to provide equitable opportunities for all children, regardless of their birthplace.\n\nThe government has responded by citing the allocation of additional funds to early years providers, aimed at bridging this attainment gap. However, this response appears somewhat superficial given the magnitude of the problem. The IPPR's research extends beyond mere statistics, emphasizing the broader socio-economic implications of such educational inequalities. It highlights that the combined northern city-regions possess nearly as many well-qualified individuals (3.6 million) as London (3.7 million), yet the demand for skilled workers in the North is projected to rise\u2014a demand which the current education system in the region may struggle to meet.\n\nIn response to these findings, the IPPR has proposed 11 critical benchmarks for the government's Northern Powerhouse initiative. These benchmarks are not mere suggestions but necessary measures if there is to be any substantial economic revitalization in the north. Ed Cox, IPPR's director, critically points out that without addressing the foundational issues of education and training, particularly for the youngest demographics, the vision of a powerhouse economy will remain a distant dream. It is not enough to invest in infrastructure like railways and motorways; there must be a concerted effort to develop the 'human capital' of the North.\n\nMoreover,",
        "North, a 24-year-old rugby player, experienced a significant incident during a match where he landed on his head following a high tackle by Adam Thompstone. This event occurred during his team's 19-11 loss against Leicester Tigers on Saturday, 3 December. In light of this, there have been discussions about North's future in rugby, with some reports suggesting he should consider ending his career. However, according to Mallinder, North is determined to continue playing and is not seeking to be treated in a manner that would prematurely end his career. The Welsh international has a history of head injuries, having previously taken a six-month break from the sport due to multiple head impacts, including a notable concussion while scoring a try against Wasps in March 2015.\n\nDespite North's assertion that he was not knocked out during the recent incident, he will not participate in Northampton's upcoming game against Sale Sharks on Boxing Day. Mallinder relayed that North recalled the entire sequence of events during the tackle, from being airborne to landing, and insisted that he remained conscious. Nonetheless, Mallinder acknowledged the possibility of a brief loss of consciousness, emphasizing that should North suspect a concussion, he is prudent enough to seek the necessary recovery time.\n\nFollowing the incident, North consulted a specialist on Tuesday, who confirmed the absence of any symptoms. However, as a precaution due to the potential of a concussive episode, North has been sidelined for a few weeks. Additionally, a concussion review group has been established to examine the handling of North's case and assess the club's responsibilities. Mallinder expressed confidence in the medical team's and the club's conduct, hoping that the review's findings will be both accurate and favorable, underscoring that there was no intentional wrongdoing on their part.",

Rossouw, embarking on his inaugural season in the storied fields of county cricket, maintained an air of enigmatic charm, refusing to divulge whether his departure had been compelled by the powers that govern Cricket South Africa. \"Maybe, maybe not,\" he mused cryptically to BBC Sport, his words a tantalizing promise of a tale yet to be unveiled. \"I think that story is one I'm going to tell at a different time,\" he added, leaving the narrative suspended like a masterful plot twist.\n\nBy virtue of Kolpak contracts, sportsmen from nations with associate trade agreements with the European Union are granted the coveted right of free movement akin to EU citizens. In a curious twist of fate, they are not categorized as overseas players within the confines of their contracts, yet this newfound freedom comes at a cost: they relinquish eligibility to don their national colors on the international stage. Abbott and Rossouw's choices emerged amidst the backdrop of Britain's impending exit from the European Union, joining a burgeoning exodus of South African talents making the leap before the dawn of the new domestic season. Among their compatriots, the versatile all-rounder Simon Harmer has pledged his skills to Essex, while Stiaan van Zyl and David Wiese have set their sights on the coastal allure of Sussex, and the formidable fast bowler Hardus Viljoen will unleash his fiery pace for Derbyshire.\n\n\"Right now, I'm just going to enjoy life here in England,\" Rossouw proclaimed with a sense of liberation, as he embarked on a three-year odyssey with Hampshire. \"I'm enthusiastic about the season. I'm 100% clean cut on my decision and I don't think that's going to change any time soon,\" he declared with resolute clarity. \"Right now, my home is in England and I want to be here beyond the next three years for Hampshire.\" For Abbott, the four-year contract heralds a poignant homecoming to the county that embraced him as an overseas talent in 2014. \"I made a lot of friends here during my last spell",

The impressive success of last year's inaugural race, as reported by its organisers, injected a remarkable \u00a350 million into the region's economy, proving its immense potential. This three-day spectacle was initiated by the tourist body Welcome to Yorkshire, after the county's splendid hosting of the Tour de France Grand Depart in 2014, which saw an astounding turnout of over 1.2 million spectators lining the expansive 320-mile (515km) route. Mr. Parnaby noted that the previous year's event drew vast crowds of spectators to East Riding, emphasizing the substantial impact. \"The council feels that the investment made by the authority, circa \u00a3100,000, to bring part of the race here is money well spent and will provide opportunities for local traders to capitalize on increased spending and help boost the East Riding economy,\" he stated, underscoring the promising economic ripple effects. The race's arrival has been met with a warm reception by others in Beverley. Local amateur cyclist Ed Neilson shared his hopes that the start of the race would inspire other cycling enthusiasts to visit the charming town. \"It's nice to see Beverley getting some recognition,\" he remarked, reflecting a sense of local pride. \"I think that a few people felt it missed out a little last year, because it wasn't shown on the telly.\" Garry Payne, the owner of",

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, accused the doctors' union of spreading \"misinformation\" and refusing to engage in discussions aimed at improving patient care. Hunt has proposed changes to junior doctors' contracts, which he describes as \"unfair,\" particularly in regards to pay and weekend working conditions. He asserts that the proposed changes will not result in pay cuts or increased working hours, countering claims made by the British Medical Association (BMA).\n\nThe BMA, however, maintains that their doors have always been open for productive dialogue, and attributes the strikes to what they term Hunt\u2019s \"shambolic mishandling\" of the situation. The disagreement traces back to 2014 and has sparked a series of strikes across England, with the next planned as a 24-hour strike where only emergency care will be available, starting from 08:00 GMT on Wednesday. Dr. Johann Malawana, chairman of the BMA\u2019s junior doctor committee, criticized Mr. Hunt\u2019s approach, stating that the contract being imposed had been \"roundly rejected\" by junior doctors. Malawana emphasized that junior doctors already work extensive hours across all days of the week under their current contracts. He argued that expanding services to a fully operational seven-day week would necessitate hiring additional doctors, nurses, and diagnostic staff, along with increased financial investment.\n\nThe dispute has also drawn comments from political figures such as Shadow Health Secretary Heidi Alexander, who accused Mr. Hunt of \"insulting the intelligence\" of junior doctors. She asserted that junior doctors are highly educated and capable of understanding the proposals and the nuances of the negotiations. The conflict highlights the broader challenges facing the National Health Service (NHS) in terms of staffing, resources, and the balance between maintaining current services and implementing new ones. As the situation unfolds, the focus remains on finding a resolution that aligns the interests of healthcare providers with the needs of patients, ensuring the sustainability and quality of healthcare in the future.",

        "The discussion surrounding the removal of the engines, which have lain dormant for two years, is one that carries significant weight and consequence for the capital's emergency response capabilities. As it stands, should the engines be permanently withdrawn, the city would be left with 142 active vehicles, a figure that has sparked concern and debate. The funds saved from this controversial proposal are intended to enhance the brigade\u2019s effectiveness by allocating more personnel to the Fire Rescue Units, a move that underscores the ongoing effort to optimize resources amid financial constraints.\n\nHowever, this plan has met with staunch opposition from the Fire Brigades Union (FBU), which has labeled the potential removal as \"dangerous and reckless.\" The union is adamant in its stance, emphasizing the critical role these engines play in ensuring the safety and security of London\u2019s populace. The London Fire Brigade (LFB), on its part, has devised three separate plans aimed at achieving necessary savings, with assurances that neither fire stations will close nor firefighters will be forced out of their jobs. The LFB has been able to maintain its London-wide attendance time targets even with the 13 engines out of operation, yet acknowledges that reinstating them could trim response times by about four vital seconds for the first engine reaching an emergency scene.\n\nAlternative solutions have been proposed to balance safety and fiscal responsibility. London Assembly Member Andrew Dismore has suggested reactivating the 13 fire engines, while simultaneously implementing alternate crewing strategies at stations equipped with certain specialist appliances.

        "The account belonging to the esteemed news agency was temporarily suspended, with a public advisory issued to disregard any tweets until further notice. This precaution followed the dissemination of a false message alarming the public with the statement: \"Breaking: Two Explosions in the White House and Barack Obama is injured.\" The misleading tweet had a significant impact, causing a sudden and sharp decline in the US financial markets, evidenced by the Dow Jones Industrial Average's 150-point drop as the message rapidly circulated. On the evening of the same day, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) confirmed that it had launched an investigation into the matter. Concurrently, Jay Carney, the White House spokesman, addressed the press to reassure that President Obama was unharmed, which facilitated a swift recovery in the financial markets. The Associated Press (AP) subsequently clarified: \"The @AP twitter account has been hacked. The tweet about an attack at the White House is false.\" By Wednesday, the account was reinstated. The agency disclosed that the hacking incident followed multiple attempts by cybercriminals to compromise the credentials of AP journalists. In response, AP took measures to rectify the situation, including the deactivation of other Twitter accounts as a precaution and collaboration with the social media platform to investigate the breach. Paul Colford, an AP spokesman, confirmed these actions. Additionally, AP reporter Mike Baker revealed that the hacking occurred shortly after several staff members received a sophisticated phishing email, which appeared to originate from a colleague\u2019s account. This email directed recipients to a link, disguised as leading to an \"important\" article on the Washington Post website, which instead led to a counterfeit login page. A group identifying as supporters of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, known as the Syrian Electronic Army, claimed responsibility for the cyberattack, boasting: \"Ops! @AP get owned by Syrian Electronic Army! #SEA #Syria #ByeByeObama.\" This group has also claimed involvement in similar breaches of other notable media outlets\u2019 Twitter accounts, including those of Agence France Presse, Sky News Arabia, al-Jazeera mobile, and CBS News.

        "The case of John McCormack, as presented at Perth Sheriff Court, underscores the severe consequences of negligence on the road, particularly when operating large vehicles like articulated lorries. Despite the gravity of the incident, which involved endangering the lives of a family with three children, McCormack continued his reckless journey for an additional 30 miles post-collision. This is a testament to the potential dangers posed by inattentive driving. The fact that multiple motorists had to take evasive maneuvers to avoid further collisions highlights not only McCormack's disregard for road safety but also the critical importance of maintaining vigilance while driving. Prosecutor Rebecca Kynaston's recounting vividly paints a picture of chaos and potential tragedy, with the lorry barreling down the wrong side of the road, forcing other drivers to veer onto the verge for safety. It is alarming that, after such a forceful impact with the family's car\u2014enough to bend the truck's structure\u2014McCormack persisted in his hazardous path. This ongoing threat was only halted thanks to police intervention, emphasizing the critical role of law enforcement in ensuring public safety on highways. Despite the defendant's stated lack of recollection, purportedly due to a sneezing episode, the court's imposition of 250 hours of unpaid work and a two-year driving ban serves as a necessary punitive and preventive measure. Defence solicitor David Holmes's argument regarding McCormack's intention to cease driving post-incident is somewhat undermined by the severity of the situation, which should have compelled more immediate self-reflection and responsibility. Sheriff Lindsay Foulis's remarks succinctly capture the potential catastrophe narrowly averted, illustrating the broader implications of such negligent behavior on major roads.",
        "In a solemn statement, it was declared that Foreign Affairs Secretary Perfecto Yasay would broach the contentious matter at a significant two-day Asia-Europe summit commencing on Friday, graced by the presence of China's venerable Premier Li Keqiang. The air was still charged with the reverberations of a UN-backed tribunal's ruling on Tuesday, which resolutely declared that China's sweeping claims in the South China Sea lacked any legal foundation. Undeterred, China stood defiant, vowing to disregard the ruling entirely, asserting that the tribunal held no legitimate jurisdiction, and declaring that its extensive activities within the region would remain resolute and unchanged.\n\nThis Asia-Europe Meeting Summit (Asem), set against the backdrop of Ulaanbaatar's vast steppe in Mongolia on Friday and Saturday, was poised to be the first grand multilateral diplomatic congregation since the momentous 12th of July ruling over the South China Sea. The esteemed summit would gather a mosaic of 53 leaders hailing from both Asia and Europe, among them representatives from nations such as Vietnam and Malaysia, who, like actors on a shared stage, also staked their claims to the contested territories in the tumultuous waters.\n\nAdding another layer of import, it would be the inaugural unveiling of the new Philippine government under President Rodrigo Duterte on the sprawling world stage. The Department of Foreign Affairs, with a firm resolve, declared that Mr. Yasay, standing in as the voice of Mr. Duterte, would \"engage in discourse within the ambit of Asem's agenda concerning the Philippines' peaceful and rules-based approach to the South China Sea, underscoring the imperative for all parties to honor the recent decision.\" In its essence, this was the Philippines' most forthright proclamation on the tribunal's ruling thus far.\n\nTreading a path distinct from his predecessor, Benigno Aquino, Mr. Duterte embraced a more conciliatory, albeit pragmatic, approach, proposing that the Philippines might entertain the notion of sharing natural resources with China in the disputed areas, contingent upon a favorable tribunal ruling. Initially, the Philippines had hailed the decision as a \"milestone,\" yet their celebration was one of quiet dignity rather than exuberant jubilation.\n\nIn stark contrast, China, which laid claim to almost the entirety of the South China Sea",

There was also a bottle of Penderyn whisky, an emblem of the country's burgeoning distilling industry, known for its smooth finish and distinctive flavor.\n\nIn addition to these gastronomic delights, the basket contained a piece of handcrafted Welsh slate, a symbol of the nation's renowned mining heritage, once the heartbeat of the local economy. This was complemented by a beautifully woven woolen scarf, made from the fleece of native sheep, showcasing the craftsmanship and timeless fashion statements of Welsh artisans.\n\nA small booklet accompanied each basket, detailing the stories behind these gifts, providing a narrative journey through the landscapes, traditions, and innovations that make Wales unique. The booklet aimed to offer a glimpse into the country\u2019s soul, inspiring curiosity and admiration for a land rich in history and natural beauty.\n\nFirst Minister Carwyn Jones expressed that these gifts were more than mere tokens; they were a heartfelt invitation to the world to explore Wales further, beyond the grandeur of the summit. He noted that they encapsulated the essence of Welsh pride and warmth, qualities he hoped each delegate would carry back to their own countries.\n\nAs the summit concluded, the lasting image was one of unity and collaboration, where history and modernity intertwined seamlessly. The summit was not just a diplomatic success but a celebration of Wales itself, a testament to its ability to host and impress on a global stage.

        "Until now, Google Assistant had only been available on the firm's own Pixel phones, creating a somewhat exclusive ecosystem that limited the broader reach of Google's AI capabilities. The service, much like Apple's Siri on iPhones, enables users to interact seamlessly with apps and ask questions, effectively integrating AI into daily digital tasks. LG was among the first smartphone manufacturers to leap at the opportunity to incorporate the assistant into its new device, the G6, highlighting a strategic move to enhance the user experience and elevate market competitiveness. Google's update is set to commence its rollout this week to users equipped with Android 6.0 Marshmallow or 7.0 Nougat, a pivotal step in democratizing access to advanced AI technology. \"With this update, hundreds of millions of Android users will now be able to try out the Google Assistant,\" stated Gummi Hafsteinsson, product lead for Google Assistant, in a blog post. However, it is crucial to note that Google's foray into expanding its assistant's accessibility is met with robust competition. At the Mobile World Congress tech show in Barcelona, Lenovo Moto unveiled plans to integrate Amazon's Alexa assistant into the Moto Z phone. This integration will be facilitated via an innovative alternative back \u2013 a MotoMod \u2013 that Amazon will market for the Moto Z later this year. Meanwhile, at the CES tech show in Las Vegas the previous month, Chinese tech behemoth Huawei announced its intent to include Amazon's rival Alexa assistant on its phones, signaling an increasingly competitive landscape. Google Assistant, in its quest to differentiate itself, is engineered to initiate and sustain conversations with users, effectively responding to follow-up queries in a manner that is slightly distinct from its competitors. \"It is a natural step for Google to offer",
        "The election commission, known as Inec, anticipated announcing the winner of the election by Monday. Despite this, the United Nations has commended the electoral process, even though it was marred by technical glitches, protests, and incidents of violence primarily attributed to the notorious Boko Haram group. In several regions of Nigeria, voting extended into a second day due to issues with the newly implemented electronic card readers. Among those impacted by these technological problems was President Jonathan, who was unable to cast his vote using the new system designed to curtail electoral fraud. His party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), which had initially opposed the implementation of these card readers, labeled the situation as a \"huge national embarrassment.\" In response, Inec's chair, Attahiru Jega, emphasized that the failure only affected a small portion of the 150,000 card readers deployed across the nation.\n\nThe election had already been postponed by six weeks owing to the ongoing insurgency perpetrated by Boko Haram militants. This insurgency rendered the election atmosphere highly volatile, with polling stations in the north-eastern states coming under attack. Bauchi State, in particular, experienced such intense confrontations between security forces and the insurgents that a curfew was imposed. Despite these significant challenges, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon lauded the \"determination and resilience\" displayed by Nigerian voters, acknowledging the courage of the electorate in the face of threats and actual attacks by Boko Haram and other factions. He expressed in a statement that, notwithstanding the disruptions, the voting process was \"largely peaceful and orderly.\" This sentiment was echoed by the regional bloc Ecowas, which urged Nigerians to accept the election results gracefully.\n\nHowever, tension simmered in the southern Rivers State, where large crowds of protesters decried alleged killings of opposition workers and voting irregularities. Inec expressed its concerns regarding these grievances, especially after one of its offices was set ablaze",
        "The tale of Geoffrey Stewart, aged 74, of Dumfries, weaves a poignant narrative of loss and resilience amidst the haunting beauty of the Southern Uplands. He belonged to a trio of seasoned wanderers, men in the autumn of their lives, who vanished amidst the mist-veiled hills on what was a seemingly innocuous Tuesday. Alas, the cruel hand of fate intervened, as the authorities solemnly declared his passing late on the tranquil Wednesday night, within the hushed halls of Dumfries and Galloway Royal Infirmary. \n\nIn a sorrowful twist, another kindred spirit from Dumfries, George Crosbie, aged 73, succumbed earlier that very Wednesday, as if to underscore the fragility of mortality. Yet, hope clings to the soul of Bobby Thomson, the 64-year-old companion, who remains ensconced within the sterile sanctuary of hospital care. The Stewart family, in the midst of their grief, reached out with the tendrils of compassion, enveloping all affected families in a cocoon of love and solidarity during this somber and heartrending epoch. Their words brimmed with warmth, extending heartfelt thanks to the valiant rescuers and the steadfast hospital staff of Dumfries and Galloway Royal Infirmary, their gratitude a beacon amidst the shadows.\n\nThe saga unfolded as the men, seasoned in their pursuit of nature\u2019s embrace, failed to return from a cherished pilgrimage in the Durisdeer hills. A cohort of sixteen intrepid souls, members of the illustrious Moffat Mountain Rescue Team (MRT), accompanied by two faithful search and rescue canines, scoured the rugged terrain through the veil of night, their efforts undeterred by the tempestuous elements. Yet, nature unleashed her fury, a maelstrom of blinding rain, swirling snow, fierce winds, and an impenetrable fog, forcing the search to",
        "Unemployment numbers have seen a slight decline, with figures dropping to 1.69 million between January and March, a decrease of 2,000 from the previous quarter. Despite this minor reduction, the jobless rate stayed steady at 5.1%, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Meanwhile, the employment landscape depicted a more positive trend, as the number of individuals actively employed rose by 44,000, bringing the total to 31.58 million. This upswing nudged the employment rate to a historic peak of 74.2%. \n\nHowever, not all indicators were favorable. The number of job vacancies experienced a significant dip, falling by 18,000 to 745,000. This marked the first decline in nearly a year, signaling potential shifts in employer hiring patterns. David Freeman, a seasoned statistician at the ONS, commented on this nuanced scenario, stating: \"The employment rate has hit another record high, but this time the increase is quite modest. With unemployment very little changed, that is further evidence the jobs market could be cooling off.\" \n\nOn the wage front, average earnings, including bonuses, saw an uptick of 2% compared to the previous year, a slight increase from the 1.9% growth observed in the three months leading up to February. The ONS attributed this variation to the timing of bonus payouts, which had a noticeable impact on total earnings. Excluding bonuses, earnings demonstrated a year-on-year rise of 2.1% in the quarter ending in March, though this was a slight decrease from the previous quarter's 2.2% growth.\n\nThe claimant count for jobless benefits showed a reduction, with 2,400 fewer individuals filing in April, bringing the total to 737,800. However, revised data shows a concerning increase of 14,700 claimants between February and March, marking the most significant rise since autumn 2011. \n\nThese figures drew mixed reactions from officials and economists alike. The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Stephen Crabb, remarked positively on the data, highlighting the record-breaking number of people in employment and the historically low unemployment rate of 5.1%. In contrast, economists provided a more cautious interpretation. David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, pointed out that despite the record-high employment figures, the broader economic indicators, including manufacturing, trade, and GDP, suggest",
        "Tatenda Taibu, at the age of 32, brought his illustrious cricketing career to a close in 2012, having represented Zimbabwe in 28 Test matches and 150 one-day internationals. His unexpected reappearance on the cricketing scene has caused quite a stir, particularly at Hightown St Mary's Cricket Club. Nick Gordon, the club's publicity officer, recounted his initial skepticism upon learning of Taibu's interest, stating, \"When he explained who he was, I thought it was a hoax.\" However, as the discussions progressed and references from reputable sources within the Zimbabwe cricket community were obtained, it became evident that the opportunity was genuine. \"The conversation developed, we got references from people in the game in Zimbabwe and we've talked ever since. It's a real coup for us,\" Gordon elaborated. Taibu, a former wicketkeeper-batsman, is poised to make his debut for the Second Division team when they face Alder on 24 April.\n\nIn an interview with BBC Radio Merseyside, Gordon revealed that Taibu approached Hightown St Mary's after the club had advertised for an overseas player for the summer season. \"It's not every day that a club like Hightown St Mary's signs a player like Tatenda,\" he remarked, highlighting the rarity of such an acquisition. Gordon was taken aback by Taibu's candid admission, \"I had to do a double take, it was so unusual. We put out an advert for young players but he said 'I'm not a young player, I'm a retired Test cricketer.'\" Despite Taibu's hiatus from professional cricket since his retirement, Gordon expressed confidence in his abilities, stating, \"This guy has played at an incredibly high standard of cricket and we are happy to take the risk. Even if he hasn't picked up a bat since 2012, he will be more than sufficient for our needs this summer.\"\n\nThe news of signing a former international cricketer with an impressive record of 1546 runs",
        "The hashtag #penuriecarburantdansunfilm, translating to \"fuel shortage in a film,\" surged to the forefront of France's Twitter trends on Tuesday, generating over 5,000 tweets. This social media phenomenon coincided with a nationwide strike opposing new labor laws, which has significantly disrupted operations across all of France's eight oil refineries. Consequently, it is estimated that around 20% of petrol stations are either completely out of fuel or experiencing low supplies. French social media users creatively engaged with this issue by drawing cinematic parallels, mentioning films such as Total Recall, a science fiction saga released in 1990 and again in 2012. The connection is further emphasized by the fact that Total is the name of a prominent French multinational oil and gas company. In a wave of humor and creativity, users adapted film titles to mirror the fuel crisis: the iconic Pulp Fiction was humorously morphed into Pump Friction, while The Full Monty was cleverly renamed The Fuel Monty. In a nod to the fuel-dependent narratives of the Mad Max franchise, Mad Max: Fury Road transformed into Mad Max: Fury Bicycle Lane. American actor Vin Diesel, famed for his role in the action-packed Fast and Furious series, became a focal point of wordplay, inspiring titles such as Last and Furious, Pas Fast Mais Furious (\"Not Fast But Furious\"), Immobile and Furious, and Fuel Furious. Similarly, 8 Mile, a semi-autobiographical film starring US rapper Eminem, was whimsically reimagined as 0 Mile and 8 Miles a Pied (\"8 Miles on Foot\"). Stanley Kubrick's directorial legacy also featured prominently, with adaptations like Fuel Metal Jacket, a clever twist on Kubrick's 1987 film Full Metal Jacket. The French title for Kubrick\u2019s 2001: A Space Odyssey, 2001, l'Odyss\u00e9e de l'espace, adds another layer of irony as Espace is the name of a minivan produced by French",
        "The alarming revelations by Immigration Minister Peter Dutton underscore a critical and escalating issue facing Australia today. The interception of a 17-year-old at Sydney airport two weeks ago, alongside similar interventions involving two brothers aged 16 and 17, highlights the growing menace of radicalization among Australian youth. Mr. Dutton's comments on the \"growing threat\" from Australians attempting to join extremist groups like Islamic State (IS) shed light on a disturbing trend that demands immediate and comprehensive countermeasures. The deployment of special anti-terror units across Australia's major airports, initiated in August, underscores the government's recognition of the severity of this threat. However, these measures alone may not suffice to address the root causes of radicalization.\n\nThe return of these teenagers to their parents' custody, while investigations continue, raises critical questions about the adequacy of Australia's current approach to de-radicalization and reintegration. Concerns from parents at the prestigious high school attended by the two brothers, who have been allowed to resume their studies, reflect the broader societal unease surrounding the reintegration of individuals with suspected ties to extremist ideologies. The fact that over 85,000 individuals have been questioned by anti-terrorism units since August signifies a proactive stance, yet it also suggests a pervasive and deep-seated issue within the community.\n\nAustralia's estimate that about 90 of its citizens have already travelled to Iraq or Syria to engage in conflict, with 20 reportedly killed, paints a sobering picture of the national security landscape. The unconfirmed reports of Melbourne teenager Jake Bilardi's involvement in a suicide attack in Syria further amplify these concerns. His father's poignant comments about Jake being treated as a \"trophy\" by IS, paraded and glorified online despite his lack of a Muslim background, reveal the sinister tactics employed by such groups to lure vulnerable individuals. This case, alongside others, highlights the necessity for a nuanced understanding of the psychological and social factors contributing to radicalization.\n\nThe criminalization of travel to IS strongholds like Mosul and Raqqa,",
        "The amnesty under discussion pertains to offenses perpetrated amidst the political instability following the ousting of Mr. Thaksin Shinawatra in a military coup. The lower house of Thailand's National Assembly approved this contentious bill in the early hours of Friday morning. Following this legislative approval, the bill is now slated for consideration by the Senate. Despite the heightened political tension, the opposition Democrat Party abstained from participating in the vote, resulting in the bill passing with an unprecedented 310 votes to none. The bill\u2019s progression through the Senate is anticipated to be more challenging, as noted by the BBC South East Asia correspondent Jonathan Head, due to the composition of the Senate, where half of its members are appointed. Nonetheless, the possibility remains that the Senate could approve the bill as early as the following week, potentially inciting further public demonstrations.\n\nProponents of the bill argue that its enactment is essential for closing a tumultuous chapter of Thailand's political history initiated by the 2006 military coup, which unseated Mr. Thaksin and left the nation deeply polarized. This period of unrest included significant events such as the occupation of Bangkok's main airport in 2008 and the two months of street protests in Bangkok in 2010, which resulted in nearly 90 fatalities, predominantly among civilian protesters. However, detractors argue that the amnesty would effectively permit those accused of human rights violations to evade accountability. Brad Adams, the Asia director of Human Rights Watch, expressed concern on 21 October, stating that the proposed amnesty would enable officials and protest leaders responsible for violent acts to avoid punishment, thereby denying justice to victims and potentially emboldening future perpetrators due to the lack of repercussions.\n\nThe opposition contends that the bill is primarily designed to facilitate Mr. Thaksin's return to Thailand without having to serve a prison sentence for his 2008 corruption conviction, which he has consistently dismissed as politically motivated. Originally, the amnesty was restricted to ordinary protesters implicated in previous street conflicts, but it was unexpectedly broadened two weeks prior to encompass anyone investigated by agencies established post-coup. It was one such investigation that led to Mr. Thaksin's conviction and subsequent self-imposed exile, as per our correspondent's report. Despite being overthrown, Mr. Thaksin has maintained significant popularity, particularly among rural constituents, leading to the electoral success of parties aligned with him in subsequent general elections. His sister, Yingluck Shinawatra, is the current prime minister, adding another layer to the political dynamics at play.\n\nIn response to the bill's passage, the opposition has declared its intention to contest the",
        "Over the next few years, Forest Enterprise Scotland is embarking on an ambitious and inspiring endeavor to plant these precious acorns around the serene and picturesque landscapes of Loch Trool and the enchanting Cree Valley. This grand vision isn't just about numbers\u2014although the aim to nurture approximately 600,000 young trees is certainly impressive. It's about weaving a tapestry of life, crafting a \"large and vibrant habitat\" that will stand as a testament to nature's resilience and beauty. Environment forester Gareth Ventress captured the excitement and urgency of this mission beautifully when he shared the moment they realized they were in for a \"bumper crop\" of acorns. It spurred them into action, setting the wheels in motion for a comprehensive plan to gather these tiny, yet mighty, seeds.\n\nIn a heartwarming show of unity and collaboration, they rallied the support of colleagues throughout Scotland, asking them to join in the collection of acorns from native oak woods scattered across the national forest estate. This was not just a logistical move but a symbolic one, representing the collective effort to breathe life into the ambitious dream of woodland expansion. The Cree Valley Community Woodland Trust, Borders Forest Trust, and Moffat Community Woodlands all played pivotal roles in this massive acorn collection drive, each contributing to the broader vision of native woodland expansion in the picturesque south of Scotland.\n\nBy blending these acorns from various corners of Galloway Forest Park, they are not merely planting trees; they are fostering a new generation of woodlands with enhanced genetic diversity.

        "Mr. Carney articulated that the strategic mobilization of long-term financing for environmentally sustainable projects in emerging markets could serve as a pivotal mechanism for promoting financial stability on a global scale. Speaking at a prestigious event in Berlin, he emphasized the pivotal role that Germany could play, particularly leveraging its G20 presidency in 2017, to spearhead significant progress in this arena. Historically, Mr. Carney has consistently highlighted the multifaceted risks that climate change poses to the finance industry, underscoring the urgency for proactive measures. During his address on Thursday, he delved into economic theory, asserting that capital ideally should be channeled from advanced economies to their emerging counterparts, driven by the prospect of higher returns. Paradoxically, he noted, the current dynamics reflect a reversal, with capital predominantly flowing into advanced economies, thus contributing to a decline in bond yields within these regions. He further elaborated that when capital does intermittently flow into emerging markets, it often exerts an unsettling influence on their financial landscapes.\n\nIn this intricate context, Mr. Carney identified green finance as a substantial opportunity, advocating for the alignment of capital flows with long-term projects concentrated in regions where growth remains heavily reliant on carbon-intensive methods. Such strategic alignment, he posited, would inherently foster financial stability. He highlighted the burgeoning potential of green bonds, instruments designed to support initiatives like water conservation or renewable energy projects aimed at curbing carbon emissions. Though optimistic projections suggested a potential doubling of green bond issuance in 2016 from the previous year\u2019s $42 billion, Mr. Carney acknowledged their current representation as a mere 1% of the asset holdings by global financial institutions. He further elucidated that the maturation of this nascent global asset class holds considerable promise for advancing a low-carbon future, simultaneously catalyzing global investment and economic growth.\n\nMr. Carney also addressed a poignant dilemma: the temporal disconnect between recognizing the economic incentives to combat climate change and the feasibility of effective intervention. He warned against the dangers of precipitous",

As the drama unfolds, Joyce Mitchell, another employee at the Clinton Correctional Facility, has already faced charges for her alleged role in aiding the escape. The notorious prisoners, Richard Matt and David Sweat, executed a bold and seemingly cinematic escape using power tools, slipping out of the high-security Clinton Correctional Facility like shadows in the night. The breakout has triggered a massive manhunt, a frenzied pursuit to capture these two convicted killers who have evaded justice once again. Mr. Palmer, the beleaguered prison employee, now finds himself entangled in this web of intrigue, held on bail after appearing before a judge. He faces charges of promoting prison contraband, tampering with physical evidence, and official misconduct. His lawyer, Andrew Brockway, passionately defends his client, acknowledging that Palmer did indeed deliver the meat but staunchly maintaining that he had no knowledge of its hidden contents or the prisoners' nefarious plans. \"He did pass the hamburger meat,\" Mr. Brockway admitted candidly, conceding the lapse in judgment with a tone of regret. \"He shouldn't have done it.

        "Hibernian, affectionately known as Hibs, found themselves overwhelmed by the formidable force of Bayern Munich, succumbing to a staggering 10-1 defeat on aggregate. Meanwhile, Glasgow City's valiant efforts were thwarted as they fell 3-1 to Eskilstuna United from Sweden. Yet, amid these disheartening results, Anna Signeul, with a voice brimming with optimism, told BBC Scotland, \"I think it is fantastic for Scottish football that we actually have two teams in the Champions League.\" Her words resonated with pride, underscoring the significance of this achievement as a testament to the progress Scottish football has made, earning them two coveted spots in this elite competition.\n\nSigneul, ever the astute observer, highlighted that the Netherlands, hosts of the upcoming Euro 2017 finals and Scotland's friendly adversaries on 20 October in Livingston, boast the participation of only one team in Europe's premier club contest. She expounded, \"It is all based on rankings and what Glasgow City and the national team have done previously.\" Her emphasis on past achievements reflected the hard-earned recognition that Scottish teams had garnered on the international stage.\n\nHibernian, making their inaugural appearance in the knockout phase, faced a stern trial by fire. \"It was a great experience for this young Hibs team,\" Signeul commended, acknowledging the daunting task they faced against Bayern Munich, a side brimming with talent and ambition. With a squad of 26 full-time professionals, representing a mosaic of nationalities\u2014Austrians, Swiss, Germans, and Dutch\u2014Bayern presented an intimidating challenge. Signeul noted, \"Bayern Munich also had the golden boot player of the tournament in the Olympics, so it was a tough side.\" The experience, she asserted, was invaluable for the Hibs players, a glimpse of the pinnacle they aspired to reach. \"Sometimes you play in internationals and get a little bit cheated - you think you are better than you are because you are playing weaker teams,\" she reflected.\n\nGlasgow City, the indomitable Scottish champions for nine consecutive seasons, carried the weight of past glories into their encounter. Their journey to the Champions League quarter-finals in 2014 lingered in memory, a testament to their potential. However, recent campaigns have seen them stumble in the round of 32, a fate not befitting their stature. Signeul lamented, \"Glasgow City had a chance in their game, but Eskilstuna, the Swedish runners-up, were a little too strong for them.\" Despite two commendable performances, fortune did not favor them, as the goals materialized",
        "The emerging trend of shared transportation, as opposed to individual ownership of cars and bikes, is gaining traction as a vision for the future. A significant development in this direction occurred recently in the capital with the launch of oBike. This company, supported by substantial venture capital investment, has introduced a fleet of hire bikes on the streets of London. It envisages deploying thousands more by the summer's end, drawing on its extensive experience with large-scale operations in South East Asia. What sets oBike apart from existing cycle hire services is the absence of docking stations. The bikes are equipped with a locking rear brake, allowing users to leave them at any convenient location. Access to these bikes is facilitated through a mobile application, which also enables users to locate them via GPS technology. A one-time refundable deposit of \u00a349 is required, followed by a usage fee of 50p for every half-hour. The entry of additional companies into this space is anticipated. oBike has expressed a commitment to collaborating with the existing cycle hire scheme and has articulated a social mission to contribute to the improvement of London's air quality and the reduction of emissions. Furthermore, the company has expressed a desire to cooperate with Transport for London (TfL) and local councils; however, this cooperation has not yet materialized. Some local councils have voiced strong dissatisfaction over the lack of prior consultation, as bikes have been deployed in their areas without any notification. Hackney Council, although supportive of cycle hire initiatives in principle, has raised concerns over the potential for oBikes to obstruct pavements and roads due to their ability to be left anywhere. The council also indicated that there has been no communication with the company to date. In Hammersmith & Fulham, local authorities expressed their grievances to oBike after approximately 400 of its characteristic yellow bikes unexpectedly appeared in the area. Cllr Stephen Cowan, leader of Hammersmith & Fulham Council, stated: \"We're very much in favour of cycling, but we expect companies to properly consult with us first. This launch could have been much better thought out.\" Consequently, oBike has agreed to retrieve the bikes that were placed in the borough. This situation reflects a recurring pattern in London, where tensions arise between municipal authorities and innovative technology companies. The response from City Hall has been somewhat cautious. Will Norman, London's Walking and Cycling Commissioner, remarked: \"We need dock-less bike operators to work with TfL and borough councils to ensure these bikes work for all",
        "Gabon was selected as host on Wednesday by the Confederation of African Football's Executive Committee, prevailing over competing bids from Ghana and Algeria. This decision marks a significant milestone for the Central African nation, with Gabonese football official Jean-Felix Mba Nze expressing the country's ambitious aspirations: \"We will prepare ourselves to win the Nations Cup in 2017,\" he proclaimed. \"We have decided to play and win the cup.\" Gabon's history in the Nations Cup reflects a trajectory of gradual improvement; they first attempted to qualify in 1970 but did not reach the finals until 1994. Their most notable performances were recorded in 1996 and again in 2012, the latter of which was a notable event as Gabon co-hosted the tournament with Equatorial Guinea. However, in the most recent edition of the Nations Cup held in Equatorial Guinea, Gabon's national team, the Panthers, faced disappointment by exiting at the group stage after securing one victory and suffering two defeats. The upcoming 2017 Nations Cup will be a historic occasion as it represents the first instance of Gabon hosting the tournament independently. Mba Nze, who serves as the secretary-general of the Gabonese Football Federation, articulated the nation's commitment to hosting an exemplary event: \"Our main challenge is to organise a better competition than we did in 2012,\" he informed BBC Sport. According to him, Gabon's successful bid was attributed to a well-executed presentation and tangible improvements in infrastructure, including stadiums, hospitals, and media facilities. \"We are more developed than we were for the last Nations Cup,\" he asserted. For the 2017 edition, Gabon plans to reutilize two stadiums from the 2012 finals\u2014one in the capital city of Libreville with a capacity of 45,000, and another in Franceville accommodating 25,000 spectators\u2014while introducing two newly constructed venues in Port Gentil and Oyem, each designed to seat 20,000, with completion targeted by August 2016, five months ahead of the tournament. Gabon\u2019s selection has stirred controversy and discontent among the nations it surpassed. The Algerian media expressed strong disapproval, with Algeria Soir condemning the decision as a 'sporting and political defeat for Algeria,' and El Watan critiquing the insufficient",
        "They spend an average of \u00a3581 annually on music festivals, with a particular affinity for VIP passes and upgraded camping options that elevate their festival experience to unparalleled heights of comfort and exclusivity. This demographic, predominantly male, represents the \"superfans,\" individuals whose passion for music extends beyond mere attendance. They are more inclined than the average consumer to physically acquire music through CDs or digital downloads, reflecting their deep-rooted appreciation and support for the artists they admire. The data, gathered from a survey of 504 UK residents who had immersed themselves in at least one festival over the past year, was commissioned by the ticketing website Eventbrite. These \"superfans\" are pivotal in propelling the music festival market forward, often serving as influential voices in their circles by recommending music and events to friends. They constitute 28% of the festival-going audience, with more than half (54%) expressing a willingness to attend events solo, underscoring their unwavering dedication to the festival experience. On average, they invest \u00a345 more per event compared to a casual fan, but their loyalty is not unconditional: 46% express concerns that festivals are increasingly becoming \"too corporate.\"\n\nIn the vibrant tapestry of the UK's festival landscape, over 100 music festivals take place each year, ranging from iconic gatherings like Glastonbury and T In The Park to more niche events such as the Cambridge Jazz Festival and Jamie Oliver's Big Feastival. Annually, 3.7 million people partake in these musical celebrations, contributing to an industry that supports over 39,000 full-time jobs, as reported by Music UK. Nevertheless, the sector faces its challenges, with slim profit margins and a saturated market leading to struggles for some festivals. The summer of 2012, marked by relentless rain, saw 57 festivals canceled, including notable events like Oxegen and The Big Chill. Although the rate of closures has decelerated since that soggy summer, several festivals, such as the Temples festival in Bristol, Down To The Woods in Sedgefield, and Field Day in Tunbridge Wells, were canceled this year, while Sonisphere has yet to make a comeback from its planned hiatus in 2015.\n\nDespite these hurdles, the latest research offers a beacon of hope for festival organizers, with 88% of respondents indicating plans to attend a festival again next year, and more than half expressing a desire to attend even more events. \"It has been a challenging year for some festivals, with",
        "Over the weekend, the quaint seaside town of Cromer witnessed an unsettling surge in criminal activities, with a total of 37 offenses reported, casting a shadow over the community. Among these distressing incidents was the harrowing assault of a teenager, whose attack has been linked by locals to an influx of a group of travelers. This connection has sparked intense discussions among residents, who are voicing their concerns and seeking answers. Suffolk Constabulary had previously alerted Norfolk Police about the impending arrival of this group, which had been served a local authority notice to vacate Lowestoft following a series of disturbances there. Despite this forewarning, Norfolk Police acknowledged that while they had been informed about the travelers, there was a lack of specific intelligence regarding their exact destination.\n\nThe weekend's most grievous incident occurred on Friday evening when a young woman in her late teens was assaulted near a bus stop on Cadogan Road, close to the town's picturesque seafront. Investigations by Norfolk Police suggest a potential link between this appalling crime and the broader disorder that plagued the town. In connection with the incident, one suspect was taken into custody but subsequently released pending further investigation, leaving the community on edge as no additional arrests have been made.\n\nAs tensions simmered, the atmosphere in Cromer became increasingly fraught. On Saturday night, a BBC journalist relayed an encounter with a local taxi driver who described the situation as \"travelers rampaging the town.\" Meanwhile, The Wellington pub decided to shut its doors early after a group of around 30 travelers reportedly became disruptive and unruly, creating an environment of unease. Local business owners, like Lee Sale, who operates an ice cream shop, recounted how families were left feeling unsettled by the travelers' intimidating demeanor. Similarly,",
        "The incident occurred on a tranquil summer evening as the A320 jet soared through the skies south of Brookmans Park, its engines humming steadily against the backdrop of a fading sunset. The cockpit was a picture of calm professionalism, with the pilot monitoring the instruments and exchanging routine communications with air traffic control. Suddenly, out of nowhere, a white quadcopter drone, with its distinctive red and blue striped rotor arms, darted perilously close to the aircraft, flashing past in a split second. It was a sight that left the pilot momentarily stunned, a blur that seemed to defy the very protocols designed to maintain the sanctity of airspace.\n\nThe report from the UK Airprox Board, a body tasked with investigating near-miss incidents, painted a picture of a narrow escape, a moment where fate seemed to intervene. The lack of time to initiate any avoiding action underscored the severity and suddenness of the situation. The pilot's immediate report to air traffic control captured the urgency of the moment, describing how \"something had just gone over the top of him\" during the flight above Potters Bar at approximately 18:45 BST on that fateful day, 15 August 2016.\n\nThe air traffic controller, initially considering the possibility of another aircraft having crossed paths, was met with the pilot's adamant description of a smaller, more colorful object, significantly different from any conventional aircraft. The drone, under a metre in size, had flouted the very rules laid out in the Air Navigation Order (ANO) 2016, which mandates that drone flights must be",

        "Once again, the Parades Commission's decision regarding the annual parade past St Patrick's Church on Donegall Street in north Belfast has sparked polarized reactions, highlighting the entrenched divisions in the region. The restriction that only the Orangemen and their 13 notified bands can march past the church, accompanied solely by the sound of a single drumbeat, underscores the delicate balancing act the Commission attempts to maintain between cultural expression and communal sensitivity. This year, the stipulation that all music must cease 43 meters from the church to prevent it from being audible within its precincts has been met with fierce criticism from the Orange Order. The organization perceives this as an unwarranted imposition, contending that the Commission is merely echoing \"republican propaganda,\" and accuses it of undermining Protestant heritage by imposing arbitrary restrictions on their parades. The Orange Order's statement decries the new criterion as both \"mischievous\" and \"absurd,\" reflecting their view that such measures serve only to censor their cultural expression on what they believe should be shared streets in Northern Ireland's capital.\n\nNorth Belfast MP Nigel Dodds of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) echoed these sentiments, describing the Commission's determination as emblematic of a \"bureaucratic monstrosity\" that panders to, or is at least unduly influenced by, republican residents. His stark admonition that the Parades Commission has \"lost the run of itself\" by even considering additional restrictions, such as potentially banning music outside Clifton Street Orange Hall, reflects a profound frustration with what is perceived as an erosion of traditional rights and freedoms. In stark contrast, SDLP assembly member Alban Maginness presents a conciliatory perspective, welcoming the determination as a prudent measure aimed at fostering respect and harmony during the marching season. By emphasizing the desire of St Patrick's parishioners and Carrick Hill residents to be treated with dignity, Maginness",
        "The narrative surrounding the 34-year-old midfielder's recent conclusion of his tenure with Atletico Kolkata in the Indian Super League paints a vivid picture of the dynamic nature of football careers. James McFadden's remarks underscore a recurrent theme in the sport: the allure of returning to familiar grounds. Having personally experienced the cycle of departures and returns, McFadden articulates an understanding that is both personal and empathetic. His mention of \"Pearo\" \u2013 Stephen Pearson \u2013 highlights the shared experiences and emotions that accompany such career moves. Pearson's career trajectory, which includes significant stints at clubs such as Celtic, Derby County, and Bristol City before his successful period at Karela Blasters, speaks volumes about the fluid nature of professional football.\n\nDespite his achievements in India, where he helped Kolkata secure a commendable fourth-place finish preceding a play-off victory against his former club, Pearson finds himself at a crossroads once more. McFadden\u2019s comments reveal a strategic intent by Motherwell, a club noted for its culture of embracing former players, to harness Pearson's abilities both on and off the pitch. The language used by McFadden, particularly phrases like \"great addition\" and \"welcomed back with open arms,\" suggests a deliberate campaign to rejuvenate the squad with experienced hands known to the club\u2019s ethos.\n\nMoreover, the club's recent acquisitions \u2013 Elliot Frear from Forest Green, and loan deals for Zak Jules from Reading and Russell Griffiths from Everton \u2013 reflect Motherwell's proactive stance in the transfer market.

        "Kevin Mcleod's body was discovered in the frigid waters of Wick harbour in the bleak month of February 1997. The 24-year-old's untimely demise was initially cloaked in the shrouds of accident, yet his family, steadfast and unwavering in their convictions, believed the injuries upon his body painted a more sinister tale of murder. In response to the fervent pleas of his kin, a comprehensive assessment of \"all information known\" was undertaken, initiated by the concerned engagement between his grieving family and Chief Constable Phil Gormley. \n\nThe police endeavored to unravel this tangled web, tracing and engaging with those shadowy figures who had been in Wick on the fateful night of Kevin\u2019s passing\u2014silent witnesses who had remained in the spectral embrace of anonymity until now. Yet, in a voice trembling with the weight of resolve, Kevin's mother, June, confided to BBC Scotland her undying determination: should this meticulous inquiry \"turn up nothing new,\" she vowed that she and her family would persist in their quest for a fresh investigation, tirelessly seeking justice like a lighthouse beacon cutting through the fog.\n\nIn a parallel vein, a distinct assessment was mandated by the chief constable to scrutinize how the Mcleod family\u2019s grievances had been managed since that sorrowful year of 1997. Detective Chief Superintendent Gareth Blair, helming the major crime division of Police Scotland, articulated the purpose of this task with a solemn gravitas, acknowledging the enduring shadow Kevin's death cast over his parents and their yearning for a definitive resolution. \"Our sympathies remain with them,\" he expressed, underscoring the point that this effort was not a full reopening of the floodgates of investigation but rather a meticulous and reasoned analysis of the voluminous accounts and fragments of evidence accumulated over time.\n\nSpecialist officers from Police Scotland's major crime command embarked on this formidable task, diligently tracing and engaging with individuals who had been present in Wick that ill-fated night, persons who had sighted Kevin yet had not taken the step forward until now. In a poignant meeting on Tuesday, Det Ch Supt Blair conveyed to Mr. Mcleod's parents the somber conclusion of the assessment. He revealed that despite the exhaustive review, no evidence of criminality surfaced, leaving Kevin's death inexplicably veiled, and thus, determining",
        "Matthew Eteson is on trial at Preston Crown Court for the manslaughter by gross negligence of Kelly Webster, a vibrant 36-year-old, and her young daughter, Lauren Thornton. The ill-fated duo tragically succumbed in their slumber aboard a boat navigating the serene waters of Windermere in April 2013. Mr. Eteson, aged 42 and hailing from the quaint suburb of Hale in Greater Manchester, resolutely denies the charge leveled against him. The ill-fated excursion to the picturesque Lake District was meant to be a joyous retreat, a festive gathering marking the Easter bank holiday weekend to commemorate a dear friend's birthday. Yet, under the dim afternoon skies on 1 April, Mr. Eteson, in an unguarded moment, relocated the generator from the deck, employing it to power a 1kW fan heater, its hum intended to warm the chilly sleeping quarters, as detailed by the prosecutor, Mr. Graham Reeds QC.\n\nThe court was illuminated by the harrowing revelation that the occupants were oblivious to the insidious build-up of toxic carbon monoxide gas, as the sensors, their silent guardians, had been previously disabled. Mr. Reeds painted a sorrowful picture of the mother and daughter, hailing from the close-knit community of Leyland in Lancashire, found in their serene sleeping states aboard the once-trusty vessel, the second-hand Bayliner 285 motor cruiser named Arniston, their lives extinguished by the deadly grip of carbon monoxide. Mr. Eteson, who had sought slumber in a separate compartment, distanced from the lethal generator, was also ensnared by the toxic vapors but emerged from his stupor to the gut-wrenching discovery of their",

        "The Employment and Learning Minister, Dr. Stephen Farry, has opted to withdraw a crucial premium payment of \u00a31.1 million, which had been allocated to compensate for the college's small scale and specialized status. This decision comes as a significant blow given the institution's limited enrollment of fewer than 1,000 students and an annual revenue of \u00a34.7 million. Critics argue that the elimination of this small institution premium, alongside broader reductions in Department of Employment and Learning (DEL) funding, threatens to slash the college's budget by a staggering 31%. In a somewhat mitigating development, an additional \u00a332 million allocation for DEL within this week's budget announcement offers a glimmer of hope, reducing the projected budget cutback to 26.5%. Despite this slight improvement, the college principal, Prof. Peter Finn, maintains that the revised financial constraints remain excessively challenging. He accuses Dr. Farry of leveraging this financial predicament to pressure the college into accepting one of the proposed solutions for reforming teacher training in Northern Ireland, none of which allow St. Mary's to maintain its current level of autonomy. The institution, determined to preserve its unique character and Catholic ethos, faces a crossroads where it must balance its values with the necessity for collaboration. Prof. Finn expresses a willingness for \"very deep sharing\" among teacher training institutions, envisioning a scenario where cross-institutional teaching enriches the educational landscape. He vehemently contests the rationale for abolishing the small scale and specialist premiums, pointing out that while similar payments were discontinued in England, those institutions benefited from the ability to impose higher tuition fees and had no cap on student admissions, privileges not extended to St. Mary's. Meanwhile, Stranmillis University College, which primarily prepares teachers for non-Catholic schools, encounters parallel challenges. Although Stranmillis has been engaged in merger discussions with Queen's University since 2008, the process has encountered resistance and remains incomplete. The potential reduction in funding and the abolishment of the premiums would similarly undermine Stranmillis, leaving both institutions grappling with significant financial and strategic uncertainties.",
        "The investment, secured by nearly \u00a315 million from the Welsh government, is a significant boost for the region, with production scheduled to commence in late 2018. This financial commitment underscores the Welsh government's strategic efforts to fortify the local economy and preserve its industrial heritage. Economy Minister Edwina Hart emphasized the importance of this deal in safeguarding over 750 skilled Welsh jobs, ensuring economic stability and prosperity for many years to come. \"In a climate of stiff global competitiveness, we have been actively seeking to win a share of this investment for Wales,\" she remarked, highlighting the intense global race to attract such high-level investments. She further praised Ford's decision to manufacture its new, cutting-edge engine in Wales as a testament to the local management team's stellar reputation and the unparalleled quality and dedication of the Welsh workforce.\n\nThe Ford Bridgend plant, which has been a cornerstone of the local economy since it opened in 1980, has consistently demonstrated resilience by securing successive investments totaling more than \u00a32.8 billion. This long-standing presence not only bolsters the local economy but also indirectly supports around 10,000 jobs across south Wales, with 1,860 individuals directly employed at the plant itself. Ford's collaboration with technicians based in Essex and Germany during the design and development phase of their innovative, fuel-efficient engine range exemplifies the company's commitment to integrating global expertise with local skills.\n\nA letter from Ford to its workforce, revealed by the BBC in June, outlined the necessity for adapting working conditions at Bridgend to bolster the plant's competitive edge and secure the much-coveted investment. This change is crucial in the face of fierce international competition, where minor advantages can tip the scales. Welsh Conservative shadow economy minister William Graham hailed the announcement as a reflection of the \"confidence in the UK government's efforts to rebuild the economy.\" He noted that this development is particularly advantageous for Bridgend workers, as it coincides with the cessation of Jaguar Land Rover engine production at the site, thus averting potential job losses.\n\nHowever, the transition is not without challenges. Earlier this year, the plant faced the difficult decision to let go of 200 fixed contract workers following the end of engine manufacturing for Volvo.

        "S4C derives a significant portion of its funding from the license fee. Recently, UK ministers have initiated an extensive review of the BBC, sparking debates over the future of its funding and operations. David Davies, the MP for Monmouth, has emphasized to BBC Wales that S4C holds a unique status due to its pivotal role in promoting the Welsh language. Ministers have outlined that S4C should strive to achieve cost efficiencies akin to those being sought by the BBC. However, concerns have been raised by the Labour party, cautioning that any reductions in the BBC's budget could adversely impact S4C's operations. Despite these apprehensions, Culture Secretary John Whittingdale assured MPs of a sustained commitment to S4C, particularly over the forthcoming years, expressing a desire to engage in dialogues with S4C's management imminently.\n\nIn a conversation on BBC Radio Cymru's Rhaglen Dylan Jones, Mr. Davies reiterated the government's awareness of S4C's significance. He underscored that S4C transcends being merely a broadcasting station; it is a cornerstone of preserving and nurturing the Welsh language's future. Mr. Davies hinted at the possibility of the Welsh Affairs Committee, under his leadership, potentially launching an inquiry into broadcasting matters, including an examination of S4C's situation. Although he clarified these were his personal opinions, he strongly advocated for S4C's continuity, considering it a \"special case\" deserving particular consideration.\n\nS4C has voiced its own concerns, emphasizing that since 2010 it has faced \"substantial cuts.\" In forthcoming discussions with ministers, it plans to highlight the \"uniqueness\" of its offerings and articulate its \"value and importance\" from both cultural and economic perspectives.

        "The latest Markit Report on Jobs for Scotland paints a vibrant yet complex picture of the employment landscape as of April. The report highlights a remarkable surge in both permanent and temporary job placements, marking a significant milestone in Scotland\u2019s employment sector. Notably, the demand for temporary staff reached unprecedented heights, nearing a decade-long record. Yet, this buoyant growth narrative is not without its challenges. Recruiters, while buoyed by the surge in employment opportunities, express growing concerns over diminishing candidate availability. Employers are increasingly finding it difficult to source the necessary skills, casting a shadow over this otherwise promising growth.\n\nThe Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) underscored the urgency of this issue, urging the incoming government post-general election on June 8 to prioritize safeguarding access to international talent pools. Furthermore, REC emphasized the critical need for investment in the development of UK jobseekers. The report reveals that the upward trend in permanent appointments persisted for a third consecutive month in April, achieving its most rapid expansion in 21 months. This stands in stark contrast to a general slowdown observed across the broader UK landscape. Temporary placements also exhibited a sharp ascent, with the steepest increase since August 2014. Despite these promising figures, the availability of workers saw a further decline in April, with a notable drop in permanent staff availability, the most significant in nine months. The pool of temporary candidates in Scotland also dwindled dramatically, marking the fastest decline in nearly two years.\n\nCertain sectors have emerged as frontrunners in this burgeoning demand for talent. IT and computing, nursing/medical/care, and hotel and catering are leading the charge in the quest for permanent hires. Meanwhile, temporary staffing demands are being driven by the nursing/medical/care, IT and computing, and engineering and construction sectors. Alongside this surge in demand, the report highlights a significant rise in average starting salaries for permanent positions in Scotland, while the rate of increase in temporary pay reached its pinnacle for the year.\n\nKevin Green, REC\u2019s chief executive, expressed an optimistic outlook, noting that the Scottish jobs market's resurgence has sustained momentum for three consecutive months. He attributed the soaring demand for temporary staff to employers' strategies to navigate Brexit-induced uncertainties and meet rising consumer demand. The news of rising starting salaries for permanent roles is a positive development, bringing a sense of optimism to the region.\n\nHowever, Green also issued a cautionary note, pointing to the declining availability of candidates as a",
        "Envoy Sigrid Kaag addressed the international community with a tone of urgency and determination as Syria seemed poised to miss a critical deadline to remove its arsenal by Sunday. This arsenal, composed of lethal chemical weapons, is slated for total destruction by 30 June, as mandated by an international agreement. This agreement, a significant diplomatic effort, was brokered between Russia and the United States in the aftermath of a devastating sarin rocket attack near Damascus, which claimed the lives of hundreds and shocked the conscience of the world. The intricate process of dismantling Syria's chemical weapons is being meticulously managed by a multinational mission under the vigilant oversight of the UN Security Council and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW).\n\nDespite the looming UN deadline, Damascus had previously committed to expediting the removal process, promising to have all chemical stockpiles out of the country by 27 April. This promise followed a series of missed deadlines, highlighting the logistical and political challenges of such a monumental task. \"The substantial majority of the chemical weapons material has been removed from Syria, yet remains undestroyed, which ties directly to the impending 30 June deadline,\" emphasized Ms. Kaag, who leads the OPCW-UN Joint Mission, during an interview with the BBC. Her words underscored the critical importance of evacuating the remaining chemical agents from the sole site where they are still housed.\n\nAdding to the complexity of the situation, Ms. Kaag expressed the UN's growing concern over troubling reports of Syrian forces allegedly deploying chlorine gas as a weapon. Chlorine, notably absent from the original disarmament agreement, represents a loophole that has raised fears of potential chemical attacks by the Syrian regime. Although Damascus has staunchly denied such accusations, the international community remains wary.\n\nAccording to the OPCW, Syria\u2019s chemical weapons predominantly exist as separate precursor chemicals, which only form deadly warfare agents",
        "The announcement that media playback is not supported on this device is a minor inconvenience overshadowing a significant accomplishment in women's football. Kim Little, a pivotal figure for the Seattle Reign, emerged victorious in a supporters' poll to claim the esteemed BBC World Service award, marking her as the second recipient of this honor. This victory came despite stiff competition from a commendable shortlist featuring Gaelle Enganamouit of FC Rosengard, Amandine Henry from Olympique Lyonnais, Carli Lloyd of Houston Dash, and Becky Sauerbrunn representing FC Kansas City. Little's response to her win was a mixture of surprise and humility, reflective of her grounded nature amidst her soaring achievements. At just 25, she articulates a vision for the future of women's football, acknowledging its current thriving state while expressing hope for continued progress.\n\nThe award ceremony took place in the familiar setting of her club's training ground, underscoring the community and grassroots support integral to her success. Mary Hockaday, Controller of BBC World Service English, lauded Little's achievements, linking them to the broader narrative of women's football gaining much-needed recognition. This acknowledgment by a major media organization plays a crucial role in elevating the status of female athletes, a gesture that has long been overdue in sports media.\n\nLittle's performance for Seattle has been nothing short of stellar; she was the club's leading scorer and ranked second overall in the National Women's Soccer League, netting 10 goals and propelling the Reign to the top of the league in 2015. Her versatility and skill were further displayed during her loan stint at Melbourne City in the same year. Her career trajectory includes a notable past with both Hibernian and Arsenal Ladies, where she clinched five titles with the latter, and her impressive international record with Scotland, with 115 caps and 46 goals, speaks volumes of her enduring impact on",

In a remarkable display of skill and precision, Fraser, currently ranked as the world number 90, demonstrated his prowess on the golf course by achieving an impressive score of eight under par 63, thanks to nine birdies. This performance placed him three shots ahead of his competitors. Notably, the Rio 2016 Olympic Games saw a significant withdrawal of more than half of the men's world's top 10 golfers, who cited concerns over the Zika virus as their reason for not participating. Among the competitors, Briton Justin Rose, positioned at four under, made history by achieving the first ever Olympic hole-in-one on the par-three fourth hole. Reflecting on this achievement, Rose commented, \"There is always an element of luck but you could chalk it up as a good hole-in-one.\" He humorously added, \"I won a car that time [his last hole-in-one] but this is definitely better, better bragging rights. When you are the first to do something no one can take that away from you.

        "On 30 January 1915, England and Scotland participated in a charity rugby match orchestrated by Edgar Mobbs, a former England international player and captain of the Northampton Saints. Mobbs, an influential figure in both sports and military recruitment, organized this match with the primary objective of enlisting athletes into his World War One battalion, known as the Sportsman's Battalion. To commemorate this historic game, a centennial match is scheduled for 24 January 2015 at Olney Rugby Club, featuring a contest between players from the East Midlands region and The 1st Battalion of the Yorkshire Regiment, alongside a game where Olney Ladies will compete against the Army Women's XV.\n\nEdgar Mobbs was born in Northampton in 1882 and commenced his rugby career in Olney, later becoming the captain of the Northampton Rugby Football Club in 1907. His rugby prowess was recognized on a national level when he was selected for the English national team in 1909. Mobbs made a memorable debut by scoring a try against Australia and subsequently earned seven caps for his country. Transitioning from his athletic career, Mobbs demonstrated remarkable leadership and military acumen, advancing from the rank of private to battalion commander. He fought valiantly in significant battles such as Loos, the Somme, Arras, and Messines, earning the Distinguished Service Order and being mentioned twice in despatches for his bravery and service. Mobbs's life was tragically cut short during the Battle of Passchendaele on 31 July 1917, where he died heroically while charging a German machine gun position.\n\nAfter retiring from rugby in 1913 at the age of 30, Mobbs faced initial rejection for an officer's commission due to his age but chose to enlist as a private. Recognized for his motivational skills, he was often called upon to inspire others to join the military effort, notably addressing a large audience at a Northampton Saints game. His efforts were instrumental in persuading more than 200 men to enlist, with the 1915 international rugby match credited with inspiring hundreds more to join his corps, the Sportsman's Battalion, which became an integral component of the 7th Battalion of the Northamptonshire Regiment. Among those recruited were 16",
        "The newly established charity is poised to manage the National Heritage Collection, an assemblage of historically significant sites including Stonehenge and Dover Castle. Currently, the government allocates an annual budget of \u00a322 million towards the maintenance of this collection. The strategic objective for the charity is to achieve financial self-sufficiency over time. Meanwhile, responsibilities such as the listing of buildings will continue to receive direct government funding. This restructured entity, provisionally named the National Heritage Protection Service, will also provide advisory services on planning issues. The charity will retain the name English Heritage, and the 420 sites encompassed within the National Heritage Collection\u2014including notable landmarks such as London's Kenwood House and Charles Darwin's residence in Kent\u2014will continue to be under public ownership. Government support for the charity will be progressively reduced starting in 2015, eventually ceasing entirely, thereby granting the organization increased autonomy to diversify its revenue streams through commercial enterprises and philanthropic contributions. An allocation of \u00a380 million from the government will facilitate the establishment of the charity, ensuring its full operational capacity by March 2015. The government agency involved issued a statement categorizing the proposed changes, which will undergo a consultation process, as \"an excellent outcome.\" The statement highlighted that the current year marks the centennial celebration of state protection for heritage, and the present announcement lays the groundwork for the upcoming century. The government's investment of \u00a380 million, coupled with the inauguration of the new charity, is envisioned to secure the preservation of the National Heritage Collection for future generations. This initiative aspires to uphold the narrative integrity of the sites under its care, striving for exemplary standards in conservation and event management, and aims to provide an engaging experience that vividly portrays the historical tapestry of England.

        "Christopher Kelly, a man who had once been a beacon of support and companionship to Dorothy Beattie, committed an unfathomable act that shattered the fabric of their friendship and reverberated through the quiet town of Dunoon, Argyll and Bute. At 40, Kelly wasn't just a man; he was a father whose life had been punctuated by emotional struggles and complexities, like so many others. Yet, on that fateful day, 22 May, his life took a turn so dark that even he seemed startled by his own actions. The High Court in Glasgow became the stage where the chilling details of this tragic encounter were laid bare, revealing not just a crime, but a story of broken connections and unspoken pain.\n\nDorothy Beattie was more than a victim; she was a mother, a friend, and a woman enduring the heavy burden of numerous medical conditions that left her vulnerable and in need of care. Christopher Kelly had once been her support worker, someone who understood her vulnerabilities and was entrusted with her well-being. Over time, their relationship evolved into a friendship, a bond that seemed to transcend the professional confines of their initial connection. They socialized, shared laughter, and perhaps even confided in each other about the trials of life.\n\nHowever, the closeness they shared took a sinister turn when, as the court heard, an offhand remark about Kelly's children supposedly ignited a rage within him that he couldn't control. This outburst of violence was as shocking as it was tragic, culminating in Kelly strangling Ms. Beattie in the place where she felt safest\u2014her home. The aftermath of the attack was no less harrowing; Kelly, in a state of disarray, returned to the scene, moved Ms. Beattie's lifeless body to her bed, and fled into the shadows of his own guilt and despair.\n\nKelly's actions in the days following the incident painted a picture of a man grappling with the enormity of what he'd done. He stole from Ms. Beattie's account, a desperate act perhaps fueled by confusion and fear, and then drifted to Edinburgh, living on the fringes until his conscience drove him to confess to a",
        "The train journey from Penzance to Exeter took a turn for the disastrous when it collided with another train already stationed at platform six a little after 15:30 BST on 3 April. The Rail Accident Investigation Branch's preliminary report highlighted a critical error in judgment: the signaller had mistakenly believed there was ample room on the platform for both trains. Unfortunately, this was a grave miscalculation, leading to approximately 35 passengers sustaining injuries. For those keen on following the unfolding details, updates can be found on our Local Live pages throughout the day. The report shed light on a practice known as \"permissive working,\" where multiple trains are permitted to occupy the same platform. This arrangement was deemed suitable for platform six, yet the execution fell short of expectations. From the vantage point of the signal box, the signaller misjudged the available space, wrongly assuming the moving train could nestle in without issue. Complicating matters, the decision to redirect one of the trains to platform six arose from ongoing maintenance that rendered passenger lifts on other platforms out of service. As the moving train neared Plymouth, it accelerated to approximately 21 mph, navigating a challenging, tight left-hand curve. It was at this critical juncture that the driver, with mounting alarm, spotted the stationary train's rear perilously close to the platform's western edge. The realization of an impending collision sparked immediate action; the driver scrutinized the tracks to confirm their trajectory and, with decisive urgency, deployed the emergency brake. This desperate maneuver occurred a mere",
        "The 71-year-old incumbent, Yoweri Museveni, secured a decisive victory by garnering 60.75% of the vote, according to the official results released by the election commission. This significant lead was achieved over his nearest competitor, Kizza Besigye, who obtained 35% of the votes. Museveni's supporters have argued that his political adversaries lacked viable policies and strategies to propel the nation towards progress and development. Conversely, Mr. Besigye, who at the time was under house arrest, vehemently contested the integrity of the electoral process, labeling the results as a \"sham\" and appealing to the international community to denounce them. In a public statement, he strongly criticized the conduct of the elections, asserting, \"We have just witnessed what must be the most fraudulent electoral process in Uganda.\"\n\nFurthermore, the election faced scrutiny from European Union observers who highlighted several critical issues. They reported that the ruling party cultivated an \"intimidating atmosphere,\" which, coupled with allegations of vote rigging from the opposition, cast a shadow over the electoral proceedings. The EU Chief Observer, Eduard Kukan, acknowledged the \"remarkable determination\" demonstrated by Ugandan citizens to exercise their right to vote but noted that the National Resistance Movement's overwhelming influence distorted the fairness and competitiveness of the campaign. The electoral process was further tainted by incidents of sporadic violence and claims of electoral fraud. Additionally, the government imposed restrictions on social media platforms and messaging applications, ostensibly to control the flow of information.\n\nMr. Besigye, representing the opposition Forum for Democratic Change, was placed under house arrest on Friday, with police authorities alleging that he intended to prematurely declare election",

Despite these promising figures, the plan has sparked a heated debate among the area's political candidates, with only one expressing outright opposition and three expressing reservations about the proposed location. The community is clearly divided, as evidenced by thousands of local signatures on petitions both supporting and opposing the development. Conservative candidate Michelle Donelan has expressed a nuanced stance, acknowledging the potential benefits yet criticizing the consultation process as inadequate for a proposal she believes will \"dramatically change the town forever.\" The application for the expansive 72,000 square meter regional center remains under review by Wiltshire Council, yet the issue has already become a focal point in the local election campaign. In a debate captured for broadcast by BBC Wiltshire, Labour's Andy Newman voiced his support, having been reassured that the project would create 700 permanent skilled jobs and help elevate wages in the area. In stark contrast, Green Party candidate Tina Johnston opposes the development, arguing that the projected job creation figures are overly optimistic. Meanwhile, two candidates expressed conditional support for the plans but questioned the site's location. Julia Reid of UKIP suggested relocating the center closer to the motorway to mitigate its impact on town center businesses. Liberal Democrat Duncan Hames echoed similar concerns, expressing enthusiasm for the job opportunities but uncertainty about the suitability of the proposed site.

This purported incident occurred shortly after she had issued an apology \"on behalf of my country\" concerning the dire conditions at the Jungle camp in Calais. The Licensed Taxi Drivers' Association formally denounced such abusive behavior, underscoring their commitment to maintaining the integrity of their services. The singer detailed the encounter on Twitter, noting, \"Just tried to get in a black cab with my kids. The driver looked at me and said 'find an immigrant to drive you you stupid tart'.\" She elaborated further, reflecting on the incident's impact, \"Having lived a life of privilege, that interaction has given me a tiny glimpse of what it feels like to be discriminated against.\" Her assertions have prompted skepticism from some quarters, with one Twitter user asserting that it \"definitely didn't happen,\" and another requesting she disclose the taxi's registration plate. In response to these doubts, she accused her critics of \"victim shaming\" and explained, \"I had both my hands full with children, couldn't get to my phone fast enough.\" The association, representing approximately 5,500 black cab drivers in London, expressed their intention to collaborate with Transport for London to scrutinize the singer's allegations. Steve McNamara, the general secretary, emphasized, \"While it is not clear whether the driver in question was a member, we take any allegation such as this extremely seriously and would condemn any cabbie who treats anyone with such disrespect and uses abusive language in this way.

        "The acquisition of the 25-year-old World Cup runner-up Fernandez is a strategic move for Swansea City, with the fee believed to be approximately \u00a38 million, although the exact terms remain undisclosed. The club's recruitment strategy focuses on enhancing squad quality, and Fernandez is anticipated to fulfill this criterion effectively. He has signed a four-year contract and is expected to be available for Swansea's match against Burnley on Saturday, contingent upon receiving international clearance. Fernandez's experience is notable, having started in four matches during Argentina's journey to the World Cup final. His transfer follows the departure of 27-year-old Chico Flores to Qatar, prompting manager Garry Monk to seek a suitable replacement. Fernandez expressed his enthusiasm for joining the club, having received positive insights from Michu about the Premier League and Swansea. He articulated his long-held aspiration to play in the Premier League, acknowledging its status as the pinnacle of global football, and expressed gratitude towards Swansea for the opportunity. The defender sought advice from Michu and Jordi Amat, who spoke highly of the club's atmosphere and the relaxed nature of the city. He also mentioned his connection with Alvaro Vazquez, with whom he played during his loan at Getafe in 2013, which facilitated further insights into the club through Vazquez's friendship with Amat. Swansea is set to host Burnley on Saturday, August 23, marking their first home Premier League match following an impressive 2-1 victory against Manchester United in the season opener. Although Fernandez recently resumed training post-World Cup, his availability for the upcoming match remains uncertain. Manager Garry Monk regards Fernandez as a valuable addition to the team, citing his top-level experience with Napoli and Argentina as significant assets. At 25, Fernandez is considered at an ideal age for contributing to the team, with his physical attributes and footballing skills aligning well with Swansea's style of play. Monk emphasized the club's focus on recruiting players who can enhance the squad's overall quality, affirming that Fernandez is expected to achieve this objective.",
        "Newly unearthed CCTV footage of Charlene Downes, a 14-year-old last seen in Blackpool town centre, has emerged, providing fresh insight into a case that has remained unsolved for many years. Charlene's body has never been located, and this recent discovery has sparked renewed emotion and frustration from her mother, Karen Downes. Karen expressed her \"disgust\" at the late discovery of this footage, considering the extensive time invested in investigating her daughter's unsolved murder. Lancashire Police acknowledged Ms. Downes' sentiments, stating they \"understood\" her perspective. Despite exhaustive efforts, no one has been convicted in connection with Charlene's death. The release of the footage coincides with the anniversary of Charlene's disappearance in 2003, underscoring its significance in what has been described as the force's \"longest\" murder investigation. Ms. Downes articulated her disbelief over the delayed discovery of the footage, stating, \"What I can't fathom is why this [the footage] was never found in the previous investigation. This is the bit I'm absolutely disgusted with.\" However, she also expressed cautious optimism, saying, \"At the same time I'm happy with the footage and now hopefully they [the detectives] can move forward and we can get some answers. I want closure now... We can't move on with our lives and it's just terrible.\"\n\nDetective Chief Inspector Richard McCutcheon commented on the situation, empathizing with the family's perspective and explaining that the images were only recently uncovered, which is why they are being made public now. The footage captures Charlene alongside her sister Rebecca on Bank Hey Street at approximately 15:25 GMT on November 1, 2003, as they walked towards the Coral Island amusement arcade. Charlene returned home but revisited Blackpool town centre later that evening, marking the last known sighting of her. The police noted that Charlene was wearing the same clothes in the footage as she was on the day of her disappearance. Detective Superintendent Andy Webster has indicated that the investigation is exploring potential links between Charlene's disappearance and the broader issue of child sexual exploitation in Blackpool. He stated, \"We have identified a number of people who could potentially be victims and offenders, and we will be seeking to make arrests and prosecute abusers in the near future.\"\n\nIn 2008, a judge cleared a man of Charlene's murder, citing \"grave doubts\" about the evidence presented",
        "Julia Knight, aged 56, stands accused of the attempted murder of Irene Robson, aged 81, at Horton Hospital in Banbury in October 2014. While Ms. Knight refutes the charge of attempted murder, she concedes to the act of administering insulin to Ms. Robson. In her testimony before the jury at Oxford Crown Court, Ms. Knight explained her actions, stating that her intention was to prevent her mother from being discharged from the hospital. Additionally, Ms. Knight faces charges of causing grievous bodily harm with intent, which she also denies. She expressed her desire for her mother to continue receiving care at the hospital, rather than being sent home. Reflecting on her actions, she confessed, \"I felt terrible because I knew I was going to make mum unwell. It was a stupid, stupid, thing to do. If I could go back and change it, I would.\"\n\nMoreover, Ms. Knight admitted to deceitful behavior during the investigation, acknowledging that she had lied to police officers in January when initially questioned about the incident. The court was presented with evidence of her having forged a prescription for insulin, which she subsequently collected from a Sainsbury's store in Banbury. When queried by her defense barrister, Simon Mayo QC, regarding her initial denials to the police about injecting her mother, she explained, \"I realised it was serious. I was ashamed of what I had done.\" \n\nProsecutor John Price QC put forth the assertion that Ms. Knight's intention was to deliver a lethal dose of insulin to Ms. Robson before departing from the Horton. He challenged her, inquiring, \"Why did you inject your mother with a substance which for all you knew could kill her within five minutes and do nothing for an hour and twenty minutes?\"",

The Korea Space Launch Vehicle-1, or KSLV-1, took off from the Naro Space Center at exactly 4 PM local time, which is 7 AM GMT for those keeping track globally. Now, Science Minister Lee Ju-ho had some good news to share\u2014he confirmed that the satellite, which is set to gather climate data, made it to its intended orbit without a hitch. This launch is particularly significant because it comes on the heels of North Korea's controversial move. Just a few weeks ago, they sent up their own three-stage rocket and successfully placed a satellite into orbit, which, as you might imagine, led to quite a bit of international criticism. \n\nSouth Korea's own rocket, the 140-tonne Naro, wasn't an entirely solo effort. They teamed up with Russia, who agreed to collaborate with South Korea on three launch attempts. Now, let's not forget, previous attempts in 2009 and 2010 didn't go so smoothly. The first attempt, well, the satellite just wouldn\u2019t detach from the rocket once it was up there. And in 2010, the rocket didn\u2019t even get a chance to show what it could do\u2014it exploded just seconds after take-off. So, you can imagine the relief and excitement when officials announced that Wednesday\u2019s launch went according to plan. The rocket reached the required altitude and successfully deployed the satellite, a big win for South Korea.\n\nMinister Lee put it simply: after sifting through the data, they confirmed the Naro rocket did its job, placing the science satellite into the designated orbit. He mentioned that the satellite separated successfully 540 seconds post-launch. And there\u2019s a sense of triumph in the air\u2014Minister Lee proudly declared that South Korea had taken a significant leap to become a \"space-power nation.\" He emphasized that they see this monumental moment as a driving force to develop an independent space program. The satellite in question, named the Science and Technology Satellite-2C, is set to keep an eye on climate data. According to Yonhap news, it\u2019s supposed to touch base with its ground station at 5 AM the next day. That's when the team will fully assess whether the mission hit all its targets.\n\nUp until this point, South Korea has had satellites",

This threat materialized when the Football Association ultimately rejected the bid in April. \"When I say something, I mean it,\" asserted the 75-year-old Egyptian on Thursday, emphasizing his unwavering stance. He further disclosed that the club had been placed on the market just 22 hours following the FA's decision five months prior. Allam announced that an appeal against the rejection of the name change had been submitted to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. \"We stated earlier this year that the club would be for sale should our attempt to globally promote Hull Tigers as a brand name and as a playing name be blocked,\" he elaborated. \"As a consequence of the FA decision on 9 April, I announced on 10 April, within 22 hours, that Hull City is for sale.\" \n\nAllam, who has been at the helm of the club since December 2010, faced inquiries regarding his course of action should a buyer not materialize and the legal appeal be dismissed. \"I will give it away. Out means I'm out. Have I ever said anything and gone back on it?\" he responded, maintaining his firm commitment to his word. Despite the ongoing developments, Allam stated that he and his son Ehab, who serves as the club's acting chief executive, would remain dedicated to the club for the foreseeable future. \"If the appeal comes first, ok, no harm done. If the sale comes first - sold,\" he remarked, while remaining vague on whether there had been concrete interest from potential purchasers. He suggested he might continue his involvement should the appeal succeed. \n\nAcknowledging the need for stability among manager Steve Bruce and his players, Allam highlighted his substantial financial commitment during the transfer window, notably the acquisition of Uruguay striker Abel Hernandez for a reported club record fee of \u00a310 million.

Meanwhile, the seasoned Alan Power, 29, previously known for his time as a Republic of Ireland Under-21 player, bids farewell to Lincoln City in the English League Two. During his impactful tenure there, Power amassed over 250 league appearances, solidifying his reputation as a steadfast competitor. Both Higgins and Power have now committed to two-year agreements with Kilmarnock, a club that is clearly aligned with their aspirations, although Power's move awaits clearance.\n\nExpressing his enthusiasm, Higgins remarked, \"It feels good to be here, as it's a club that's definitely going in the right direction,\" during his introductory interview on Kilmarnock's website. Manager Lee McCulloch, known for his strategic eye in nurturing young talent, believes Higgins is a perfect match for Kilmarnock's philosophy. \"He came through Celtic's academy, which has seen many impressive young players come through,\" McCulloch noted. \"For the second half of last season, he gained valuable experience at Dundee and through time will only get better, which is only a good thing for this club.\"\n\nPower, equally excited about his new chapter, shared, \"I've heard a lot about the town and the club's history and I can't wait to get started.

This series of unfortunate events necessitates a reshuffling of the deck. The young and promising Harrison, now 24, who previously graced the field for a mere thirty minutes during England's climactic Test match against Australia in the bustling city of Sydney, has returned to the fold with renewed vigor. \"He's gone back and worked on his game very hard,\" remarked Jones to BBC Sport, his voice tinged with a hint of admiration. \"His last game against Castres was exceptional and he's probably our number one choice open-side flanker at the moment.\"\n\nIn a turn of fate, Tom Wood, once relegated to the periphery post-Rugby World Cup with the chastening critique of \"distinctly average\" performances echoing in his ears, finds himself on the verge of redemption.

Not managed by gov't employees. Come for the facts, stay for the snark.\" It's a platform that blends humor with serious scientific facts, drawing attention to the critical issue of climate change.\n\nMeanwhile, the rogue Environmental Protection Agency account, @ActualEPAFacts, shared with us their motivation: ensuring that factual information about climate change and other scientific research continues to be accessible during the Trump administration. They claimed to be run by three EPA employees who felt compelled to act when a gagging order prevented them from discussing their research publicly. Reports have suggested that the Trump administration aimed to restrict how certain government agencies, including the EPA, communicate with the public. It's noteworthy that the official EPA Twitter account has been silent since January 19, just before Mr. Trump's inauguration, highlighting the constraints placed on official channels.\n\nThe @ActualEPAFacts team expressed surprise at their growing audience, now surpassing 90,000 followers, yet acknowledged feeling vulnerable due to their actions. These rogue accounts are attracting significant attention; for instance, @RogueNASA has amassed over 370,000 followers after just a few tweets. The rogue National Park Service account, @AltNatParkSer, has attracted even more interest, with over a million followers after fewer than 300 tweets. Similar accounts representing the US Department of Agriculture, the Forest Service, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have also emerged, using terms like \"resistance\" to define themselves while sharing a blend of scientific facts and critiques of Mr. Trump.\n\nSome individuals behind these alternative accounts assert that they are disgruntled government agency workers, as inferred from their tweets. For instance, @AltNatParkSer initially tweeted they were \"being run by several active NPS rangers and friends,\" but later announced a transition to a different group comprised of activists and journalists who are former scientists. This shift illustrates a broader movement beyond just current government employees, involving a network of concerned citizens.\n\nThe inspiration for @AltNatParkSer and other similar accounts was fueled when the official Badlands National Park account in South Dakota tweeted about global warming, only to have those posts swiftly removed.

        "A comprehensive report issued by British Marine, the representative body for the leisure, superyacht, and small commercial marine sectors, revealed that superyacht revenues for the year leading up to April 2016 had impressively soared to a significant \u00a3605 million. This substantial contribution helped the wider marine industry's revenues to ascend by 1.6% to an unprecedented \u00a33.01 billion, marking the first time the sector had surpassed the \u00a33 billion benchmark since the economic downturn of 2008-2009. Despite these achievements, the report cautiously projected a deceleration in growth throughout 2017. It attributed this anticipated slowdown to the looming uncertainty surrounding the Brexit negotiations, which was expected to suppress consumer demand. After the financial crisis, the industry experienced a decline in total revenues, plummeting to a nadir of \u00a32.85 billion in the 2011-2012 financial year, but had been witnessing a steady recovery ever since. The resurgence in revenue was largely fueled by a rise in engine and equipment manufacturing, alongside a notable increase in hire and charter boat sales. Although exports had dipped slightly by 0.7% to \u00a3882 million, British Marine remarked that the sector had recently enjoyed the unanticipated advantages of a weakening pound against the dollar and euro subsequent to the referendum, enhancing the purchasing power of international buyers. Nevertheless, marine enterprises surveyed in the report anticipated that the favorable exchange rates would likely offer only a temporary advantage. In his statement, Howard Pridding, the chief executive of British Marine, expressed optimism by asserting, \"The industry remains robust - revenue is growing and we are taking on more employees.\" He acknowledged that while post-referendum fluctuations had dented business and consumer confidence, the industry maintained a",
        "The deal unveiled by Russia on Thursday to establish four \"de-escalation zones\" has garnered the backing of Turkey and Iran, signaling a rare moment of diplomatic alignment in a region fraught with discord. Yet, this move has not been met with universal optimism. The main Syrian opposition grouping remains deeply skeptical, its confidence in the agreement notably absent. Meanwhile, the situation on the ground tells a grim tale of continued strife. Activists report that government aircraft have pounded central Hama province, and there are chilling echoes of shelling and gunfire resounding through other parts of Syria. The opposition High Negotiations Committee (HNC) has voiced its reservations, criticizing the safe zones plan for lacking \"safeguards and compliance mechanisms.\" Their distrust is further compounded by the involvement of Iran as a guarantor, a role they find unacceptable.\n\nIn a broader diplomatic context, the UN special envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, conveyed a cautiously optimistic stance to the BBC, highlighting the agreement's potential significance due to the involvement of three countries that possess the influence to enforce it. Despite these positive diplomatic gestures, the reality on the ground paints a different picture. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) reported that Syrian fighter jets targeted rebel positions in Hama on Saturday, with a rebel commander corroborating that hostilities resumed after midnight, as per Reuters. The Syrian military, however, has maintained a conspicuous silence on these developments.\n\nThis \"memorandum on the creation of de-escalation areas,\" heralded by the Russian military after discussions in Kazakhstan's capital, Astana, is a testament to ongoing diplomatic efforts. Russia's foreign ministry made the full text of the agreement public on Saturday, underscoring its objectives: to halt attacks from all parties and to \"provide the conditions for the safe and voluntary return of refugees,\" alongside the efficient delivery of relief supplies and medical assistance. The four proposed zones are set to remain in effect for six months, contingent upon the finalization of their borders by Russia, Iran, and Turkey by June 4.\n\nRussian Deputy Defence Minister Alexander Fomin shared an optimistic update on Friday, noting the cessation of Russian air raids in the four zones since May 1. Nonetheless, he emphasized that Russia's air force would persist in targeting Islamic State (IS) militants elsewhere in Syria. Across the Atlantic, the US has voiced apprehensions regarding Iran's involvement, cautioning that the country has \"only contributed to the violence, not stopped it.\"",
        "The country\u2019s Chamber of Deputies had previously given their approval to the legislation. In a subsequent vote within the Senate, the bill was narrowly endorsed, passing by a margin of just six votes, following an extensive and at times fervent debate lasting 14 hours. This new law, which includes provisions allowing same-sex couples to adopt children, encountered staunch opposition from the Catholic Church and various other religious groups. The legislation, which enjoyed the backing of President Cristina Fernandez's centre-left administration, was eventually passed with a vote tally of 33 in favor to 27 against, along with three abstentions. As the deliberations inside Congress stretched into the early hours of Thursday, outside the building, supporters and opponents of the bill engaged in rival demonstrations. \"Nearly every political and social figure has spoken out in favor of marriage equality,\" remarked Maria Rachid, president of the Argentine Federation of Lesbians, Gays, Bisexuals, and Transsexuals. \"And we hope that the Senate reflects this and that Argentina, from today forward, is a more just country for all families,\" she conveyed to the Associated Press. In contrast, Ines Frank, representing a group named Argentine Families Argentina, argued that the opposition was not tantamount to discrimination, asserting, \"because the essence of a family is between two people of opposite sexes.\" In recent times, there have been several same-sex marriages in Argentina, with some subsequently annulled by the Supreme Court, igniting a legal controversy. While civil unions between same-sex couples are recognized in Buenos Aires and certain other provinces, there has been no overarching national law to regulate such unions until now. Argentina\u2019s capital is widely regarded as one of the most gay-friendly cities in Latin America, being the first Latin American city to legalize same-sex unions. Similarly, same-sex",
        "As the political landscape in the UK braces for the upcoming election, the dynamics within and between parties are unfolding with palpable tension and anticipation. The Scottish National Party (SNP), holding its breath, looks toward the endorsement of its 54 sitting MPs, a process that is almost ritualistic in its predictability yet holds significant weight in the political chess game. Among these are the particularly intriguing cases of Natalie McGarry and Michelle Thomson. Once staunch SNP MPs, they now sit as independent members, their political fates hanging in the balance as decisions loom about their candidacies. This uncertainty becomes a focal point of attention, illustrating the intricate web of political alliances and individual trajectories within the party.\n\nMeanwhile, the Labour party's executive is under the spotlight, poised to make crucial decisions about candidate selection. This process, an intricate dance of strategic considerations and personal ambitions, is further complicated by the emergence of challengers for both the Conservative and Liberal Democrat parties. The political arena is bustling with potential candidates eager to make their mark, each one a player in the larger narrative of the election.\n\nThe announcement of a snap election by Prime Minister Theresa May, swiftly endorsed by MPs with an overwhelming majority, has injected a sense of urgency and competition into the air. However, it is notable that McGarry and Thomson were the solitary voices of dissent among Scottish MPs, casting their votes against the election while their SNP colleagues chose to abstain. This act of defiance speaks volumes about their political stance and sets them apart in a landscape where conformity often prevails.\n\nAs the SNP navigates the potential absence of McGarry and Thomson, the task of identifying five suitable candidates becomes paramount, three of which will vie for seats not previously secured in the 2015 election. The call to action resonates loudly among party activists, many of whom have already thrown their hats into the ring for the Glasgow East and Edinburgh West constituencies once held by the two women. This internal mobilization underscores the party\u2019s adaptability and resilience as it prepares to face the electoral challenge",
        "Alright, so let's break this down and put it in a way that's easy to digest. The charity we're talking about is really pushing for big changes\u2014they want 10% of the 4.8 million Syrians who've been forced to leave their homes because of the civil war to find new homes by the end of the year. Now, this is all coming up just before some major United Nations talks in Geneva about the crisis. Oxfam, a well-known charity, has put a spotlight on some pretty tough numbers: so far, only 1.4% of those displaced Syrians have found help. \n\nOxfam isn't too happy with the UK's plan to resettle 20,000 Syrians by 2020. They think it's just not cutting it. But, on the flip side, the UK government says they're not just about resettlement\u2014they're also pouring a lot of effort into aiding those still in the region. In fact, Britain has pledged a hefty \u00a32.3 billion to help out with the humanitarian crisis in Syria, making them the second biggest donor worldwide right after the US.\n\nOxfam is saying, \"Hey, the UK has been pretty generous with money, but they can and should be doing more.\" They believe that richer countries with stronger economies and well-developed infrastructures need to take more responsibility for these refugees than countries like Lebanon and Jordan, which are already stretched thin with the thousands of Syrians they're hosting right now.\n\nThey want the Geneva conference to come up with some \"urgent solutions\" to offer these people safe and legal ways to start fresh in other countries. Now, Oxfam did some digging into the pledges from 28 countries that are part of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and have signed the 1951 Convention on Refugees. These countries have promised to take in nearly 130,000 Syrian refugees, but only 67,000 have actually made it to their new homes.\n\nThe 10% resettlement target Oxfam is pushing for is aimed at those the UN says are extremely vulnerable and need immediate help. According to Oxfam's findings, only Canada, Germany, and Norway have stepped up to make pledges that go beyond their \"fair share,\" a term they use based on the size",

        "In 2013, Spencer Flower, a Conservative councillor from Verwood, Dorset, found himself embroiled in controversy related to a vote that took place concerning the future of housing in east Dorset. Despite his assertion that his association with a social housing company was irrelevant to the discussion, it was revealed that Flower had voted illegally, as the company in question could have potentially gained from the plan being approved. Despite being found guilty, Flower, aged 72, is permitted to maintain his position in public office. Following a ruling at Bournemouth Magistrates' Court by a district judge, Flower received a six-month conditional discharge and was instructed to cover costs amounting to \u00a3930. The judge determined that Flower had violated the Localism Act 2011. Outside the courtroom, Flower chose not to address the implications for his political career but expressed his surprise and disappointment at the court's decision, characterizing it as a ruling based on a technicality. He emphasized that the penalty\u2014a conditional discharge for six months\u2014was the minimal one possible, and highlighted the absence of any personal financial gain or intent. As a councillor for East Dorset, Flower had participated in a February 2013 vote on the region's core strategy while serving as a non-executive director for Synergy Housing Ltd, a charitable social housing organization, for which he received an annual stipend of approximately \u00a35,000. The vote was to determine if the area's strategy should be submitted to the secretary of state for approval. Although Flower disclosed his connection to the charity before the meeting, he was still deemed guilty of voting \"without reasonable excuse\" due to his financial interest. The core strategy included proposals for redevelopment in Wimborne, and though no formal planning permission was sought, it was anticipated that some of Synergy's social housing could be enhanced by the developers, Wyatt. Flower faced charges in November, prompting him to temporarily step down as the leader of Dorset County Council to address the legal matters. Two additional charges related to non-disclosure of an interest in Zebra Property Solutions Ltd to both East Dorset Council and Dorset County Council, spanning from 1 July 2012 to 6 March 2013, were previously dismissed.

The late David Bowie's final album, \"Blackstar,\" maintained its position at the top of the charts, marking its third consecutive week at number one. This success was complemented by the presence of his other classic albums, with \"Best of Bowie,\" \"Hunky Dory,\" and \"Ziggy Stardust\" all securing places within the Top 10. In contrast, Adele's latest work continued to hold steady at the number two spot, demonstrating her consistent popularity. Meanwhile, Suede, a band profoundly influenced by Bowie, celebrated a significant achievement as their latest release debuted at number six, marking the highest new entry of the week.\n\nWhile Rihanna's eagerly anticipated album, \"Anti,\" did not initially appear on the charts due to its initial release as a complimentary download via Tidal, the rules of the Official Charts Company stipulate that such free distributions are not eligible for chart consideration. Nevertheless, Rihanna's collaboration with Drake, the single \"Work,\" entered the singles chart at number 13, despite being available for only 48 hours, showcasing her continued appeal and commercial success.\n\nAdding to the dynamic nature of the charts, a new rendition of Tracy Chapman's classic \"Fast Car,\" reimagined as a dance track by London-based producer Jonas Blue featuring Dakota's vocals, emerged as the highest new entry at number three. This tropical-influenced version surpassed the original's peak position from 1988 and its subsequent resurgence in 2011, driven by a performance on Britain's Got Talent.

        "On Sunday, the renowned preacher Mr. Joshua made a bold proclamation to his faithful congregation, declaring that he had \"seen\" a woman emerging victorious. However, when Donald Trump emerged as the clear winner in Tuesday's election, eagle-eyed visitors to Mr. Joshua's Facebook page noticed that his original prophecy had mysteriously vanished. This incident sparked widespread curiosity and debate, given Mr. Joshua's reputation as \"the prophet\" among his devoted followers. As one of Nigeria's most prominent and influential evangelists, Mr. Joshua enjoys immense popularity throughout Africa, with numerous top political figures counted among his ardent supporters. His prediction concerning the U.S. election had been aired on his television channel, Emmanuel TV, and subsequently uploaded to YouTube by an individual. A segment of this intriguing \"prophecy\" had also been featured on Mr. Joshua's Facebook page but has since disappeared without a trace. \"Ten days ago I saw the president of America with a narrow win... What I frankly saw was a woman,\" he had asserted. The unexpected turn of events led to Mr. Joshua becoming a trending topic on Twitter, especially in countries like Nigeria, Ghana, and South Africa, where users shared humorous memes mocking his prediction. Meanwhile, numerous Facebook users expressed their bewilderment and dissatisfaction with the deletion of the original post. Clive Mashiri from South Africa posed a poignant question: \"Why was the prophecy deleted? If this was uttered by the man of God, why remove it?\" Despite the backlash, Mr. Joshua still commands a loyal following. South African Gugu Mathonsi, for instance, affirmed unwavering faith in his prophecies, declaring, \"I will always believe in your prophecies, through thick and thin.\" Many of Mr. Joshua's supporters are convinced",
        "The annual event under discussion grants entrants a mere five minutes to concoct and deliver the most elaborate and convincing falsehood imaginable. This year, the victor was George Kemp, hailing from Maryport, Cumbria, who expressed astonishment at his win, citing his struggle with a persistent chest infection as a potential hindrance to his performance. Kemp's narrative was a fantastical account, where he recounted an encounter with Donald Trump and his wife in an underwater hotel. He elaborated on the tale by describing the construction of a small submarine, ingeniously fashioned from his father's antiquated bubble car. This whimsical journey purportedly led them to the Isle of Man, where they encountered an array of renowned figures within the confines of a Scottish submarine, ingeniously constructed from shortbread tins. In a further twist of the narrative, Kemp claimed that Nicola Sturgeon and Alex Salmond were involved in commercial ventures involving the sale of these oversized shortbread tin submarines to the United States of America.\n\nThe runner-up was last year's champion, Mike Naylor, colloquially referred to as Monkey Liar, who resides in Wasdale. Helen Jordan secured the third position in this year's competition. Notably, previous winners include the renowned comedian and television presenter Sue Perkins, who claimed victory in 2006. The contest has attracted international participants; in 2014, a competitor journeyed from Germany specifically to partake in the event.

        "Mark Footitt spearheaded the visitors' bowling attack with impressive figures of 3-52, wreaking havoc on the top order as the opposition crumbled, losing five wickets before the lunch interval. Meanwhile, the young and promising Sam Curran made an early impact by dismissing England opener Haseeb Hameed for a mere second-ball duck. The visitors seemed to be in trouble, but the experienced Shivnarine Chanderpaul and the determined Jordan Clark staged a remarkable fightback. Clark's exhilarating innings of 108 not out from just 133 deliveries, punctuated by a massive pulled six that brought up his century right before the day's end, was pivotal. Chanderpaul, with his trademark composure, contributed a steadfast 85 not out, anchoring the innings when it was most needed.\n\nChanderpaul, the retired West Indies stalwart, partnered with Ryan McLaren for a crucial 55-run stand which stabilized the innings after the early setbacks. However, once McLaren fell to Gareth Batty, Clark joined Chanderpaul at the crease, and the duo constructed an unbeaten 172-run partnership. Batting lower down the order, Clark quickly surpassed Chanderpaul's score, reaching his half-century with flair. The duo's resistance was only interrupted by bad light, which brought an early end to the evening session but didn't dampen Clark's momentum. His remarkable innings featured 17 boundaries and three towering sixes, a personal best that overshadowed his previous high score of 84 not out.\n\nThis reversal of fortunes was all the more commendable considering Lancashire's precarious position, having lost five wickets within the first 22 overs. Footitt, who showcased his prowess with eight wickets in Surrey's season opener against Warwickshire, dismantled the top order by dismissing opener Alex Davies, stand-in captain Liam Livingstone, and Dane Vilas. Sam and Tom Curran also chipped in with wickets during this initial burst. Reflecting on the day's play, Jordan",

This shocking event unfolded just weeks into Ronald Reagan's presidency, sending ripples of fear and disbelief around the globe. Mr. Hinckley, who carried out the attack, was found not guilty by reason of insanity. Instead of prison, he was sent for treatment to a Washington hospital, a decision rooted in the understanding that his actions were a product of mental illness rather than criminal intent. Fast forward to July, a judge made a pivotal ruling, stating that Mr. Hinckley, now 61 years old, was not a danger to himself or the public. This ruling came after years of careful observation and treatment, signaling a turning point in his life.\n\nFor quite some time, Mr. Hinckley had been spending 17 days a month at his mother's home in Virginia under strict conditions.

Purdy's fatal encounter in Bermondsey stemmed from a confrontation over \"threatening\" messages exchanged between his girlfriend and her ex, Michael Bagnall. The involvement of Andrew Bayne, 37, and his nephew Michael Bagnall, 22, both residing in Lewisham, culminated in a grim outcome, with both found guilty of murder. The impending sentencing at the Old Bailey on November 20 looms over them, marking the legal conclusion to a tale filled with impulsive decisions and tragic consequences.\n\nThe courtroom revelations painted a vivid picture of the events leading to Purdy's death. Accompanied by his friends, Callum Malone and Jack Walker, Purdy decided to confront Bagnall, a decision that proved to be fatal. The ensuing \"skirmish\" with Bagnall led to Bayne and Bagnall's retaliatory hunt for Purdy around Bermondsey. Upon locating him in Mossington Gardens, Bayne executed the fatal shot, inflicting \"catastrophic injuries,\" which led to Purdy's death the following day. This senseless act of violence, driven by misguided pride and unresolved emotions, highlights a disturbing disregard for human life.\n\nProsecutor Crispin Aylett QC illuminated the underlying tension, noting that despite Bagnall's new relationship, he was still agitated by his ex-girlfriend's decision to move on, prompting a barrage of \"threatening messages\" via phone and Facebook.

In collaboration with an academy trust, the orchestra aims to integrate music as a foundational element to elevate student motivation and achievement across various academic disciplines. John Summers, who serves as the chief executive of the orchestra, has emphasized that this initiative is designed to leverage music as a tool to \"raise aspirations\" in other scholarly areas. This educational endeavor is proposed in partnership with the City Learning Trust and is intended to be part of the government's free schools programme, with its inception contingent on approval from the Department for Education. The orchestra envisions the school commencing in September 2020, targeting students aged seven to nineteen, and promises to offer unique opportunities, including masterclasses with professional musicians, access to orchestral concerts, and interactions with artists in residence. The educational model anticipates allocating 40% of the students' schedule to specialized music instruction, in collaboration with renowned entities such as the Halle Choir, the Halle Youth Orchestra, and Halle for Youth. John Summers further elaborated on the orchestra's considerable expertise in providing high-level performance training, instrumental coaching, and choral instruction.

Initially scheduled to occur a week after the horrific events of 22 March, the march was postponed at the request of officials due to concerns over security threats. Joining the march were relatives of the victims, paramedics, and airport staff who were profoundly affected by the attacks.

Participants carried flowers as a poignant tribute to the victims, symbolizing both remembrance and hope. The procession route included a passage through the Molenbeek neighborhood, known as the residence of many alleged perpetrators involved in both the Brussels and Paris attacks. It culminated at the makeshift memorial located outside the city's stock exchange, a site that has become a focal point for collective mourning and remembrance.

Cairn Energy, which identified two significant oil reserves in the area the previous year, has projected that the fields could hold in excess of one billion barrels of oil. The initial step in its evaluation plan involves conducting a detailed 3D seismic survey, with plans to commence in the near future. Following this, Cairn aims to initiate a comprehensive exploration and appraisal program, involving multiple wells, later in the year. The Edinburgh-based company holds a 40% stake in three offshore blocks in Senegal, specifically Sangomar Deep, Sangomar Offshore, and Rufisque Offshore. Cairn's partners in this venture include ConocoPhillips, which holds a 35% interest, and FAR Ltd, with a 15% stake, while Petrosen, the Senegal National Oil Company, retains a 10% interest during the exploration phase.\n\nIn addition to its operations in Senegal, Cairn is involved in a legal dispute with the Indian government over tax issues. The company has begun international arbitration proceedings after being restricted by Indian authorities from accessing the financial benefits of its remaining 10% shareholding in Cairn India Limited (CIL). In March, Cairn received a tax demand amounting to $1.6 billion, including interest and penalties, related to the 2006-07 tax year when it was in the process of listing Cairn India on the Mumbai stock exchange. Cairn is challenging this tax bill and seeks compensation for the losses incurred due to the devaluation of its CIL stake, which, affected by declining oil prices, plummeted from $1 billion in December 2013 to $526 million as of June 30 this year. Consequently, Cairn recorded a $177.1 million impairment loss for the first half of the year,",
        "You see, in the bustling and often chaotic heart of Iraq, a dramatic scene unfolded as tear gas and live bullets were unleashed to push back a throng of predominantly Shia Muslim protestors. These crowds had gathered with a fiery purpose: to protest against the rampant corruption and security failures plaguing their nation. The atmosphere was charged as officials swiftly imposed a curfew on the Iraqi capital, a measure that has since been lifted, restoring a semblance of normalcy to the streets. This was not an isolated incident, mind you; it marked the second time this month that these determined demonstrators had successfully penetrated the fortified government sector of the city. \n\nIn the midst of this turmoil, Shia Muslim cleric Moqtada Sadr emerged as a vocal critic of the state's heavy-handed response. He condemned the use of force against the protestors and threw his weight behind what he termed as their \"peaceful and spontaneous revolt.\" Reports suggest that at least 50 demonstrators suffered injuries in the chaos. Their grievances were pointedly aimed at the government, which they accused of dragging its feet on crucial reforms while grappling with an ongoing campaign against the Islamic State group and the challenge of declining oil revenues. \n\nThe intensity of the protests reached a fever pitch when some among the demonstrators breached the sanctum of the prime minister's office and parliament. This wasn't just any area; they had stormed Baghdad's Green Zone, a secure enclave housing the parliament, vital government offices, and numerous foreign embassies. Yet, after a tense standoff, authorities claimed to have fully regained control, with the protestors retreating from the zone. \n\nThe figure of Moqtada Sadr looms large in this narrative, a cleric whose influence surged after the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. His Mehdi Army militia was at the forefront, rallying against US forces and repeatedly clashing with them, as Sadr consistently demanded their withdrawal. It's noteworthy that back in 2004, an arrest warrant was issued for Sadr, linking him to the murder of a rival cleric. The militia under his sway was also implicated in heinous acts of torture and killings of thousands of Sunnis during the harrowing sectarian violence of 2006 and 2007. \n\nSadr's journey took him into self-imposed exile in Iran, a retreat that lasted until 2011, when he returned to Iraq with a newfound call for unity and peace. Meanwhile, Prime Minister",
        "Muslim cleric Mehboob Akhtar, residing in Stoke-on-Trent, faced sentencing alongside nine accomplices, including his spouse and daughter, following their conviction for defrauding mortgage lenders. This fraudulent scheme enabled them to accumulate property worth nearly \u00a31 million, with the purported objective of exerting \"control and dominance\" over specific city areas. Akhtar received a 14-year prison term at Birmingham Crown Court. Detailed updates on this case, along with other regional news from Stoke and Staffordshire, reveal that the 60-year-old, residing at Farman Close in Fenton, was found guilty of 11 charges. These charges encompassed five counts of conspiracy to commit fraud, as well as defrauding Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) out of \u00a3271,000. \n\nThe court hearings unveiled how Akhtar, also known by the alias Saint Pirwali Pandariman, orchestrated this elaborate conspiracy for over a decade, from 2003 to 2014. Originally hailing from Pakistan, Akhtar was a notable figure in Fenton's religious community, playing a significant role in raising several million pounds in donations aimed at combating poverty through the Darbar Unique Centre in the area. However, Judge Stephen Eyre criticized Akhtar for betraying his followers, stating, \"You used the prestige and devotion of others to facilitate this offending. Your role as a spiritual guide provided cover and you financed your activities through donations obtained in part because of your spiritual role.\"\n\nThe court proceedings further revealed Akhtar's tactical decision to keep his name off most official documents, employing his wife, daughter, and niece to secure mortgages. A police search in September 2012 of residences and offices linked to the group unveiled forged documents and emails directly tied to the conspiracy. Akhtar's wife, Khadija Akhtar, aged 54, residing on Hartwell Lane, Stoke, faced conviction for cheating HMRC and conspiracy to acquire money transfers through deception, resulting in a four-year and three-month prison sentence. Meanwhile, their daughter, Rushbamani Akhtar, aged 29, received a three-and-a-half-year sentence, having been convicted of engaging in an arrangement to facilitate the acquisition, retention, use, or control of criminal property, along with conspiracy to commit fraud. Additionally, seven others, including two mortgage brokers, received sentences for charges such as conspiracy to defraud and obtaining money transfers by deception. Following the sentencing, Chief Superintendent Martin Evans of Staffordshire",

Jade Jones, the accomplished athlete who secured a gold medal four years ago, is set to defend her title in the -57kg weight category at the Rio 2016 Olympics. At just 23 years old, Jones attributes her drive for success to the inspiration she gleaned during her formative years in north Wales. Reflecting on her journey, she mentioned, \"I remember watching athletes like Kelly Holmes on TV, and that fueled my desire to pursue a gold medal.\" Now in a position where she herself serves as a role model, Jones expressed, \"To think I'm one of those role models now and people are looking up to me is lovely.\" The impact of her achievements, especially since London, is evident as an increasing number of girls have taken up taekwondo after watching it on television.\n\nJones' taekwondo journey began at age 15, nudged by her grandfather Martin, who suggested the sport as a means to \"keep her off the streets.\" Recalling the early days, she noted, \"When I first started taekwondo, there were only about four or five girls in the whole club.\" The growth in female participation has been remarkable, with Jones observing, \"Now there's loads more girls and it's just amazing to see that. Sport doesn't have to be just for boys - girls are good at it too.\" Her prowess in taekwondo is underscored by her status as the world number one in the -57kg category, alongside accomplishments like a World Grand Prix title and two European championships since her London 2012 success.\n\nJones marked a historic moment by becoming Britain's first Olympic taekwondo champion, defeating China's double world champion Yuzhuo Hou in the final. Her Olympic victory came only two years after she clinched gold at the 2010 inaugural Youth Olympics in Singapore, making her the youngest Olympic champion from Britain. Despite experiencing fluctuations in motivation over the past four years, Jones remains resolute in her quest for another Olympic gold. She candidly shared with BBC Wales Sport, \"For London, I only joined the national team in 2010, literally two years before the Olympics, and no one really expected me to even go to the Olympics.\" Her exceptional performance that year allowed her to seize the",
        "The case of Remus Hamza, a 40-year-old Romanian resident of Cardiff, has drawn significant attention due to its disturbing details and implications. Alleged to have assaulted a 20-year-old woman near Cardiff University on the night of 20 September, the case raises critical questions about consent, vulnerability, and the responsibility of bystanders. According to the prosecution at Newport Crown Court, the victim was so inebriated that she could not have possibly given consent to any form of sexual activity. This assertion highlights the ongoing legal and ethical debates surrounding consent, especially in situations where alcohol is involved. \n\nThe narrative presented by Claire Pickthall, the prosecuting attorney, paints a harrowing picture of a young woman alone, having become separated from her friends, navigating the quiet streets in the early hours, only to encounter an alleged predator. Ms. Pickthall's portrayal of the defendant as someone \"preying on single, drunk females\" underscores the broader societal issue of exploiting vulnerability, a theme that resonates with unsettling familiarity in cases of sexual violence.\n\nThe intervention of Lee Neill, a bystander who noticed Hamza with the victim, adds a layer of complexity to the scenario. His decision to take a photograph, motivated by a suspicion of \"something sinister,\" reflects both a commendable sense of civic duty and the pervasive fear of involvement in potentially dangerous situations. Despite his good intentions, the confusion that ensued\u2014where the victim mistakenly identified him as her attacker\u2014illustrates the chaos and trauma inherent in such incidents, further complicated by the effects of excessive alcohol consumption on memory and perception.\n\nMr. Neill\u2019s actions, though brave, also bring to the forefront the challenges faced by individuals who witness potential crimes. His experience raises important questions about the protocols and protections for such witnesses, who may find themselves entangled in the legal system. Moreover, the subsequent arrest of Mr. Hamza, facilitated by DNA evidence, emphasizes the critical role of forensic technology in contemporary investigations, while simultaneously highlighting the initial fallibility of eyewitness accounts in high-stress scenarios.\n\nThe victim\u2019s testimony, though",
        "Helen Bailey, a 51-year-old author, was discovered deceased in a cesspit located at her Royston, Hertfordshire residence in July 2016. Her disappearance had been noted since April 11 of the same year. Ian Stewart, her fianc\u00e9, is facing charges of murder, which he denies. Initially, Edward Farmer testified at St Albans Crown Court, stating he observed Bailey in a vehicle in Broadstairs, Kent, sometime between mid-April and June, but later conceded that the sighting might have occurred weeks earlier. During the proceedings, the jury heard Farmer's claim of seeing Ms. Bailey alone on Charlotte Street, near her holiday residence, driving what appeared to be a Range Rover or similar dark-colored 4x4. This sighting contradicts the defense's suggestion that Ms. Bailey had been abducted by two violent men and taken to Broadstairs. When pressed on the timing of the sighting, Farmer stated it took place \"about five, maybe six weeks prior to the police interview on July 13.\" Ms. Bailey was officially reported missing by Mr. Stewart on April 15. During cross-examination, Farmer admitted the sighting might have taken place as early as March, several weeks before Bailey's disappearance was officially noted. Furthermore, he confessed to having \"no reason at all\" to recall the sighting until prompted by a reporter from The Sun in June. Mr. Stewart, aged 56 and residing on Baldock Road, Royston, Hertfordshire, faces accusations of drugging Ms. Bailey, suffocating her, and disposing of her body in the pit beneath their garage. He is charged with murder, obstructing a lawful burial, fraud, and three counts of",
        "The incident at the campaign rally in New Hampshire revealed both the contentious atmosphere of political discourse and the challenges candidates face in addressing controversial topics. The Republican candidate attempted to dismiss the inflammatory comment made by a supporter, who began by asserting, \"We have a problem in this country - it's called Muslims.\" This remark occurred during a campaign event for Mr. Donald Trump, who at that time was a leading figure in the Republican primary race for the 2016 United States presidential election. The Democratic frontrunner, Hillary Clinton, criticized Mr. Trump for his apparent failure to repudiate what she characterized as \"hateful rhetoric,\" describing his inaction as \"disturbing and wrong.\" During the event in Rochester, Mr. Trump pointed to the supporter and remarked, \"I like this guy.\" The supporter continued, erroneously alleging that the then-President, Barack Obama, was not only a Muslim but also not an American, a claim grounded in the birther conspiracy that questioned President Obama's citizenship. Mr. Trump responded with laughter and phrased, \"We need this question?\" but did not provide a corrective statement regarding President Obama's faith or nationality. Instead, he ambiguously noted that \"bad things are happening\" and promised to investigate further.\n\nMrs. Clinton's rebuke of Mr. Trump was echoed across social media platforms, where she tweeted her condemnation: \"Donald Trump not denouncing false statements about POTUS & hateful rhetoric about Muslims is disturbing & just plain wrong. Cut it out.\" In alignment with Clinton, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, then-chair of the Democratic National Committee, issued a statement denouncing Mr. Trump's perceived tolerance of racism, stating that his \"racism knows no bounds.\" In contrast, Mr. Trump's campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, attempted to mitigate the fallout by asserting to the media that the candidate had only registered a question about \"training camps.\" Lewandowski further deflected attention by emphasizing what he described as President Obama's war on Christianity in the United States, a narrative that sought to shift focus from the issue at hand.\n\nThe episode bore a striking resemblance to an incident from the 2008 presidential campaign, where the Republican nominee, John McCain, famously corrected a woman at a rally who expressed mistrust of Mr. Obama, falsely attributing her suspicions to the belief that he was \"an Arab.\" President Obama, whose Christian faith and American birth in Hawaii are well-documented,",
        "He's also having to adapt and find his footing in the complex world of media while articulating his distinct policies\u2014many of which starkly contrast with those of the party's previous leadership. Mr. Corbyn has expressed strong disapproval of the government's handling of the Calais migrant crisis, emphasizing the UK's moral obligation to do more. He passionately stated, \"These are human beings, people in desperate situations\u2014they need our help and they need our support.\" Highlighting the grassroots initiatives, he acknowledged the efforts of numerous individuals who have traveled to Calais to deliver aid, urging that the UK should actively participate in the European programme addressing both Syrian and other refugees.\n\nHis stance on immigration starkly diverges from that of the UK Independence Party, led by Nigel Farage. In his recent speech at the annual conference in Doncaster, Farage questioning the feasibility of planning for essential services like education and healthcare without precise population forecasts. Meanwhile, Damian Green, the Kent Conservative MP and former immigration minister, argued that open-door immigration would be reckless. Nonetheless, Mr. Corbyn firmly believes in the positive impact of immigration on the UK. \"Our health service, our education service, and significant portions of our industrial expansion have been enormously enriched by the contributions of those who have settled here, paid taxes, and worked diligently, fostering the vibrant cosmopolitan society we cherish.\" He advocates for a welcoming attitude towards immigration, emphasizing the multitude of opportunities it provides.\n\nUndoubtedly, Mr. Corbyn intends to convey this message to his supporters as they convene in Brighton this weekend. In addition to immigration, he plans to tackle pressing issues like the housing crisis, the need for increased infrastructure investment, and his opposition to certain benefits reforms. Furthermore, Mr. Corbyn aims to demonstrate his ability to connect not only with the Labour members who backed him but also with voters in the South East who have distanced themselves from the party in recent elections. He acknowledges the formidable challenge ahead, stating that Labour is poised to regain its foothold in the South East and is eager to embrace this challenge.\n\nThe Labour conference will take place in Brighton from September 27 to 30, providing Mr. Corbyn with a significant platform to rally support and articulate his vision to a broader audience.",
        "The tragic case involving the deaths of backpackers Hannah Witheridge, 23, hailing from Norfolk, and David Miller, 24, originating from Jersey, unfolded in September 2014 when their bodies were discovered on a picturesque beach on the Thai island of Koh Tao. The subsequent legal proceedings saw Burmese nationals Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Tun, both employed as bar workers, convicted of the murders in December 2015. The court\u2019s decision was met with controversy, particularly after an appeal court in Thailand reaffirmed the death sentences initially imposed. With the judicial process advancing, the defense team was granted a 30-day window to escalate the matter to Thailand's Supreme Court, the apex of the judicial hierarchy in the country. Concerns about the integrity of the convictions were raised by the mothers of the accused, who submitted appeals to the Koh Samui court in May, focusing primarily on the contentious DNA evidence that played a crucial role in the investigation. \n\nAndy Hall, acting as a legal advisor to the families, expressed skepticism regarding the court's ability to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Tun were responsible for the horrendous acts committed in September 2014. Miss Witheridge, a promising student at the University of Essex from Hemsby, and Mr. Miller, an accomplished civil and structural engineering graduate, were found brutally bludgeoned on the serene beach. A subsequent post-mortem examination revealed the harrowing detail that Miss Witheridge had been sexually assaulted. The prosecution's case leaned heavily on DNA evidence purportedly retrieved from cigarette butts, a condom, and the victims' bodies, which allegedly linked Lin and Phyo",
        "The report by the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP) highlights a stark economic comparison, noting that the financial resources tied up in global violence approximate the combined Gross Domestic Products (GDP) of Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Spain, and the United Kingdom. This magnitude underscores not only the significant economic implications of conflict but also the growing disparity between the world's most and least peaceful nations. The annual report further elucidates this divide by identifying Iceland as the epitome of peace globally, while Syria resides at the opposite end of the spectrum. Particularly concerning was Libya, which experienced the most pronounced decline in peacefulness during 2014. This period also marked a shift in regional violence, with the Middle East and North Africa supplanting South Asia as the most violent region, a consequence of escalating conflicts that claimed approximately 180,000 lives in 2014, a stark rise from 49,000 in 2010.\n\nFurthermore, the report indicates a troubling trend in terrorism-related fatalities, with a 61% increase in 2013, culminating in nearly 18,000 deaths concentrated in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nigeria, and Syria. IEP's findings suggest that a mere 10% reduction in global violence could produce an economic benefit of \u00a31.43 trillion, emphasizing the profound economic costs of conflict, which amount to 13.4% of the world's GDP. This figure is reflective of the increased expenditures associated with internal conflicts, the maintenance of internally displaced persons (IDPs) and refugees, contributions to United Nations peacekeeping efforts, and GDP losses precipitated by conflict. The financial burden of supporting approximately 50 million refugees and IDPs, identified as the largest number since the conclusion of World War II, has surged by 267% since 2008, reaching $128 billion.\n\nIEP Chief Executive Steve Killelea expressed surprise at the observed \"inequality with peace\" across nations. While some Western European countries have achieved unprecedented levels of peace, characterized by historically low murder rates and diminished security expenditures, nations such as Iraq, Syria, Nigeria, South Sudan, and the Central African Republic have witnessed heightened violence. The report concludes by presenting a hypothetical scenario wherein a 10% reduction in violence could inject an additional $1.43 trillion into the global economy, a sum significantly surpassing the financial requirements to eliminate Greece's sovereign debt",
        "The imposition of hefty fines on Falcon and Pointer, as well as Direct Choice Home Improvements Ltd, underscores a growing intolerance for unethical telemarketing practices, specifically those that exploit or distress individuals through unsolicited and disturbing calls. The fines of \u00a3175,000 and \u00a350,000 respectively, reflect the severity of the infractions and serve as a stern warning to other companies who might attempt to operate outside the bounds of ethical conduct. Both companies attempted to deflect responsibility by blaming third-party entities for the calls; however, this excuse was inadequate in the face of evidence demonstrating their direct involvement, particularly in the case of Falcon and Pointer's egregious continuation of calls even after claiming cessation.\n\nAnne Jones, the Assistant Commissioner for Wales, highlighted the pervasive issue within Swansea, branding it as the UK's epicenter for cold-calling activities. This label not only tarnishes the city's reputation but also casts a shadow on businesses operating within the region, which may unwittingly be lumped together with the unscrupulous operators. Her observation about the \"ruthless business models\" adopted by these companies is a damning indictment of the lengths to which some organizations will go to exploit potential loopholes in regulations for financial gain. This behavior not only causes inconvenience but can also lead to significant distress, particularly in cases where calls are directed to recently bereaved individuals or those who are vulnerable.\n\nThe ICO's persistent action against six companies since 2013 illustrates a concerted effort to clamp down on such practices. The revocation of Falcon and Pointer's license and the exposure of their continued misconduct post-claim of compliance, paints a picture of deliberate deceit and a brazen attitude towards regulatory authority. Direct Choice Home Improvements Ltd's receipt of 168 complaints within a half-year period further demonstrates the extent of disregard for consumer protection laws and highlights the emotional toll such interactions have on unsuspecting individuals.\n\nSandra Busby\u2019s comments from the Welsh Contact Centre Forum emphasize the dichotomy within the telemarketing industry. While there exists a legitimate need for businesses to engage with customers",
        "The walkout is an emphatic demonstration of discontent sparked by the dismissal of two nurses, Kevin Gregson and Peter Hilton, who found themselves embroiled in a tumultuous encounter with a patient. The duo, employed at Ashworth, one of the esteemed trio of high-security hospitals in England and Wales, faced termination despite what the Prison Officers' Association (POA) staunchly defended as the application of \"reasonable force\" against a belligerent, yet unidentified patient. Mersey Care Trust, the governing body overseeing Ashworth, staunchly maintained that the termination was necessitated by incontrovertible evidence, leaving them with no recourse but to part ways with the pair.\n\nThe saga unfolded with the dispute igniting at a brisk 07:00 GMT, casting a shadow over the unit known for its stringent security measures and housing some of the country's most challenging mental health cases. Steve Gillan, the stalwart general secretary of the POA, passionately articulated his belief that the general public would stand in solidarity, feeling both outraged and profoundly empathetic towards Mr. Hilton and Mr. Gregson. He painted a vivid picture of the nurses merely responding in the line of duty to a hostile act, where the patient had viciously headbutted a fellow colleague and resorted to spitting at staff amidst the fracas. Gillan emphasized that the nurses' actions, aimed at restraint, were within the bounds of reasonableness and resulted in no harm to the patient, contrary to the plight faced by the nurses themselves.\n\nConversely, Mersey Care Trust expressed its dismay at the union's precipitate decision to strike before the unfolding of an independent employment tribunal, asserting that such a move was counterproductive to the welfare of its patients, carers, staff, and the communities it diligently serves. In a statement laden with conviction, the trust underscored its commitment to caring for \"some of the most complex and vulnerable adults in a hospital setting,\" a responsibility",

        "The adaptation of \"The Spy Who Came In From The Cold,\" a novel set against the backdrop of the Cold War, is an eagerly anticipated project spearheaded by Simon Beaufoy, the Oscar-winning screenwriter known for his work on \"Slumdog Millionaire.\" The narrative centers around Alec Leamas, a beleaguered British intelligence officer grappling with the collapse of his espionage network in East Berlin. The acclaimed author John le Carr\u00e9, expressed his enthusiasm for the adaptation, which is slated to air on BBC One. This project marks another collaboration between the BBC and the American network AMC, building on their successful partnership in producing \"The Night Manager.\" The latter series garnered widespread acclaim, with actors Tom Hiddleston, Hugh Laurie, and Olivia Colman each receiving Golden Globe accolades for their performances, and the series itself receiving a nomination for Best Mini-Series or TV Film at the prestigious awards ceremony.\n\n\"The Spy Who Came In From The Cold\" is intricately set in 1962, a mere few months following the erection of the Berlin Wall, a pivotal event in Cold War history. Within this tumultuous context, Leamas's operatives find themselves either fleeing for their lives or falling victim to the East German counter-intelligence officer Hans-Dieter Mundt. Recalled to London, Leamas is presented with the opportunity to exact revenge, setting the stage for a gripping tale of espionage and intrigue. Originally penned in 1963, the novel was subsequently adapted into a film in 1965, featuring Richard Burton in the lead role. Le Carr\u00e9 has conveyed his anticipation for this new adaptation, expressing his trust and confidence in the team assembled for the project.\n\nSimon Beaufoy, sharing in the excitement, remarked on the thrill of adapting what he regards as the premier Cold War spy narrative.",

        "The 23-year-old Heracles forward, bubbling with youthful ambition and raw talent, declared he was eagerly waiting to finalize a move to the Championship club. Meanwhile, Cardiff City manager Russell Slade firmly insisted there was no substance to these swirling reports, although he did concede to having shown some interest in the promising young player \"some time ago.\" With a clear tone of finality, Slade stated, \"To my knowledge, that's not something we're going to pursue,\" thereby temporarily quelling the rumors. The Netherlands Under-21 international, Wout Weghorst, who began honing his skills and carving a name for himself with FC Emmen before making a strategic move to Heracles in 2014, had seemingly become a hot topic in transfer speculations.\n\nHeracles chairman Jan Smit was under the impression that a transfer fee had already been agreed upon with Cardiff City for Weghorst, who was also purportedly on the radar of Scottish giants, Celtic. Slade, however, attributed the whirlwind of conjecture and pressure to the Dutch media, commenting, \"I think all the forcing and all the speculation surrounding the player appears to have come from the Netherlands.\" He reiterated, \"There was an initial inquiry some time ago. That's all I can say,\" emphasizing the lack of any immediate plans to chase after the player.\n\nAs Cardiff City aimed to bolster their squad during the transfer window, Slade expressed his desire to secure up to three new signings to enhance the Bluebirds' campaign for a Championship play-off position. With the club trailing just four points behind the top six, recruiting a potent striker became increasingly crucial after the departure of last season's talismanic top scorer, Kenwyne Jones, who had ventured to Al Jazira in the United Arab Emirates. Despite Jones' social media claims that the club had made no attempts to offer him a new deal, Slade confidently countered, \"I'm pretty sure there was a dialogue going on between Kenwyne's people, Kenwyne himself and [chief executive] Ken Choo and the board of directors.\"\n\nIn parallel, Slade dismissed rumors from Rotherham Manager Neil Redfearn about ongoing",
        "The walk-in service, a new initiative by NHS England, is designed with the dual purpose of decreasing the number of doctor appointments and curtailing the excessive use of antibiotics, which has become a pressing health concern. By potentially reducing the frequency of visits to general practitioners, this scheme promises significant financial savings for the NHS, potentially amounting to millions of pounds annually. However, there is a looming shadow over this promising scheme: pharmacies have raised concerns that funding cuts to their sector could threaten its success. \n\nCentral to this initiative is the Sore Throat Test and Treat service, which has been trialed in 35 Boots pharmacies with encouraging results. This service aims to distinguish between illnesses caused by viruses\u2014where antibiotics are ineffective\u2014and bacterial infections, which may require antibiotic treatment. The test, which involves a throat swab that measures sugars on the tongue, delivers results in a mere five minutes. This rapid diagnosis allows pharmacists to prescribe antibiotics directly, bypassing the need for a GP appointment. \n\nNHS chief executive Simon Stevens has announced plans to expand the scheme nationwide over the next year. The scheme has garnered praise from experts like Dr. Adam Roberts, a microbiologist at University College London specializing in antibiotic resistance, who described it as \"quite an innovative step.\" He emphasized the scheme's positive impact on reducing the inappropriate use of antibiotics, citing initial data that showed only 36 prescriptions were issued among 360 participants, highlighting a significant reduction.\n\nClaire Ward, chairwoman of Pharmacy Voice, has welcomed the nationwide roll-out, applauding it as the type of initiative community pharmacies should be spearheading. Nevertheless, she echoed concerns that funding cuts could hinder its implementation. In light of these concerns, the Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee reported in October that the government had proposed a 12% funding cut starting December, a move that has sparked apprehension within the sector. While the Department of Health has stated that no final decision has been made, the uncertainty contributes to the tension surrounding the scheme's future.\n\nThe throat test is part of a suite of eight medical innovations introduced to modernize the NHS amidst rising demand.

The Sakurajima volcano, nestled on Japan's Kyushu island, is garnering attention from researchers at the University of Bristol who caution that it poses a \"growing threat.\" This looming giant is perched just 49 kilometers, or about 30 miles, from the Sendai nuclear plant, adding a layer of complexity to the situation given its proximity to such critical infrastructure. Not far from there lies the bustling city of Kagoshima, home to some 600,000 people, who live under the shadow of this geological titan. \n\nSakurajima is no stranger to activity. Its history is marked by eruptions, the most catastrophic in 1914 when 58 lives were tragically lost. Japan itself, part of the seismically active Pacific \"Ring of Fire,\" boasts more than 100 volcanoes, making it a hotspot for volcanic activity. Sakurajima, in particular, is known for its regular displays of ash clouds and smaller explosions that punctuate the landscape several times a year, with February witnessing its latest outburst. \n\nJapanese authorities keep a watchful eye on this restless mountain. Currently, it's one of two volcanoes sitting at Level 3 on Japan's five-tiered volcanic warning system. This level signifies a clear warning for people to steer clear of the volcano's vicinity due to potential hazards. Dr. James Hickey, who spearheaded the study and is now with the University of Exeter's Camborne School of Mines, shared that the 1914 eruption unleashed about 1.5 cubic kilometers of volcanic material. According to their data, the volcano requires roughly 130 years to amass enough magma for another eruption of similar magnitude, placing us about 25 years from that point.\n\nA report unveiled on Tuesday highlights these insights, with contributions from both Bristol University and the Sakurajima Volcano Research Centre. Their findings reveal that each year, a staggering 14 million cubic meters of magma is being stored beneath Sakurajima's surface. To put that into perspective, it's enough to fill London's iconic Wembley Stadium three and a half times annually. Alarmingly, this rate of magma accumulation outpaces its expulsion through the smaller, regular eruptions, suggesting that a significant eruption could be on the horizon within the next three decades. \n\nEmploying innovative methods to study and model the volcano's magma reservoir, scientists hope their findings can inform and aid local authorities in preparing for potential major eruptions. Dr. Hickey emphasizes, \"Forewarned is forearmed,\" underscoring the importance of"
